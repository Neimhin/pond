0,"Oddly I find that the more time passes, the more scared I feel, although I think that could be because my mental health has been declining gradually as this pandemic has gone on and the world in general just seems to be getting worse and worse (in all ways, not just covid-related) as time passes."

12,You should be bothered about 30k deaths.
13,"But, in America you have had over 200,000 deaths in just a few months."
14,Flu pales in comparison to that.
15,"So yes it is hugely important we take COVID seriously because it is more dangerous than the flu and also appears to have longer lasting effects than the flu, even in milder cases."
16,"I agree with you, I do, but I think using this comparison gets people's backs up because we are realising they are very different diseases and one has a vaccination whereas the other does not (yet)."
17,Right now we need to focus on getting the pandemic under control as it is the most immediate threat.
18,This includes getting your flu shot and wearing the masks.
19,"The Covid winter is coming, give it time!"
20,Challenge accepted.
21,I grew up in Janesville.

35,"If it's perennial lockdowns forever, I would seriously think about whether I wanted this life."
36,Large scale vaccination distribution is too slow to keep up with the infection rate as things are now.
37,We are way behind the curve.
38,How MUCH smaller of a number are you talking about.
39,Thousands?
40,Hundreds of thousands?
41,Single digit millions?
42,"My point is that reinfections, while confirmed, are extremely rare at this point in time compared to the actual amount of confirmed, and even non confirmed cases."
43,False.
44,The vaccine doesn't trigger the immune system in the same manner as the virus itself.
45,"Depending on various factors including the vaccine vector and adjuvants, they could be far more effective and longer lasting than the immunity from acquiring Covid."
46,"Also, flu has a very high mutation rate, and we have to predict and target specific strains in our vaccine each year."
47,"Covid is relatively stable without significant mutations, and we currently think that there is minimal chance it will develop resistance to a vaccine."
48,But medication now exists that suppresses the viral load of HIV so much it can't even be detected from testing.
49,Sheesh
50,Had to look up which logical fallacy you were committing.
51,Appear to be [the False Dilemma.
52,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/False_dilemma)
53,I‚Äôve read hundreds of anecdotAl reinfections.

59,"Do I have to hold your eyes open and show you the evidence that getting the virus under control is GOOD for economies or are you just going to plug your ears and say ""I can't hear you?"""
60,It's almost like people behave differently when there's a virus spreading unchecked that they don't want to catch.
61,we can flatten the curve in just 2 weeks!
62,So the only thing is worry or don't worry?
63,Who said not worry?
64,"Don't drastically alter our lives with social distancing, lockdowns, curfews and mask wearing requirements is more like it."
65,Meanwhile my state of Florida reports several thousand new cases every single day for the last 6months at least
66,&gt; We vaccinate for it.
67,a lot of people don't do this lmao
68,That's too bad.
69,You should care about others.
70,"You're making the world a worse place, out of spite."
71,You're part of the problem.
72,It looks like they don't have an actual confirmed case of HIV anywhere there just testing as a precaution.
73,They're also testing for Hepatitis B and C. This is basically like waking up and finding out you had a 243 person orgy.
74,Dallas has had a serious increase over the past couple of weeks.
75,Hospitalizations in the Houston area are increasing but not as much as other areas.
76,Our r(t) rose above 1 for the first time in over a few weeks last week.
77,Positivity rate is also going up slowly.
78,"Oh, I don‚Äôt really lose my appetite."
79,I definitely drink too much when depressed as well.
80,The problem comes from the energy it takes to prepare food.
81,"Basically if I‚Äôm super depressed, you can forget any meal that can‚Äôt be popped in the microwave."
82,"So when I run out of convenience food I just go hungry, or order overpriced takeaway."
83,I think one aspect of peoples' complaint about CEO pay that you left out (not sure if on purpose) is that they are paid huge sums regardless of their performance.
84,He can do a horrible job or something really bad under his watch happens which loses the company a lot of money and he will still get paid a golden parachute worth millions.
85,It's suppose to be a high risk high reward job but it turns out it is actually a low risk high reward job because you get paid either way.
86,Not to mention the unknown long term effects.
87,Life and death aren't the only possible outcomes
88,It‚Äôs really not though.
89,"We have a much better understand of this virus now, this isn‚Äôt New York and this isn‚Äôt April."
90,It will be fine
91,That‚Äôs still legit though.
92,"If the virus becomes widespread enough to break the local area‚Äôs healthcare system, it‚Äôs part of the pandemic dynamics."
93,The R naught does not stay constant because human behavior can affect spread.
94,"So while there is a bounded potential of how gnarly an infectious disease can be, human and environmental factors will always play a role."
95,And one of those factors is how much stress a healthcare system can handle before it is overrun.
96,"I think this is maybe expecting too much of ""pretty great"" and disregards effective mitigation practices in lieu of vaccination."
97,"But yeah, I think too many people are depending on springtime vaccines a little too much."
98,news dec 13 - no new babies are being born.
99,The world ended and no one noticed
100,"Of course in a country as big as China, they're not going to catch 100% of the cases."
101,"I don't think any country has 100% accurate numbers simply because there's a lot of cases that never get tested

But there's no denying that China is handling the pandemic much better than most countries"
102,HIV is easier to contain because it‚Äôs not airborne but it was also widely ignored because of it being dismissed as ‚Äúgay cancer.‚Äù That bigotry cost us a lot of time and innocent lives.
103,Relative to that COVID efforts have a head start with every developed nation on earth researching it simultaneously.
104,They‚Äôre doing years worth of work in mere months using methodology and technology never before applied.
105,HIV is a virus that fucks up our immune system and mutates rapidly.
106,The coronavirus slowly mutates by comparison.
107,All of the viruses we treated before have prepped us for this fight.
108,It‚Äôs so disruptive civilization at large can‚Äôt afford to let it continue going.
109,In time I‚Äôm confident something will come along that kick it‚Äôs ass.
110,This virus is already very infectious with a low enough mortality rate that I wonder if there's all that much selective pressure to become less deadly or more infectious.
111,This Inkl website doesn't seem to be accessible without signing up.
112,"So here is the accessible version of this article:

https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/australasia/coronavirus-australia-quarantine-hiv-testing-blood-glucose-b1184299.html

Also YIKES on reusing single-use blood devices on multiple people."
113,Most family get togethers are 10-15 people max?
114,Especially in the west.
115,Let people enjoy their family if everyone consents.
116,The chances of catching covid at a single meetup that small is very low.
117,I‚Äôve always kinda envied people who lose their appetite when they‚Äôre depressed.
118,"For me, depressed means I can‚Äôt stop eating and drinking beer because why not have a disgusting pig body to hate on top of everything else..."
119,"We've got the example of the developing world right now, where the deaths just aren't happening in droves due to the lack of the elderly/obese/people with multiple comorbidities kept alive through the magic of modern medicine."
120,Rapid tests have way too high of a false negative rate and testing 25% of the population over a month will not get you there.
121,It‚Äôs just not feasible.
122,UIUC can barely keep a handle on it and they‚Äôre testing 100% of the student population at least twice a week.
123,"Test and trace can get you lower, but asymptomatic spread and a serial interval of just under 4 days means that ‚Äútesting people every 28 days‚Äù will essentially do nothing and that‚Äôs with 100% compliance *and* that‚Äôs totally ignoring how COVID spreads, which is super spreading events: once a month testing is nearly useless other than a measure of how much Covid has spread in the community."
124,It‚Äôs just a method destined to fail.
125,"I see people say this, but there's no truth to it."
126,"A smallpox size from 0 Ad or smallpox from 1910 will both kill you dead, it's that we've gotten better at prevention"
127,So basically we've lost 7+ months of our life (and counting) for nothing.
128,"Actually, we've all lost at least a decade of our lives, since we're going to have to work 10+ extra years to recover economically."
129,At the least.
130,"If you're reading this, understand it now: thanks to this destruction, you are going to retire only by the time you are 80, if at all."
131,"And now Fauci says he wants lockdowns till ""Late 2021"" and other experts are saying to brace for lockdowns till ""at least 2023""

Foolishness, my dear friendos... foolishness"
132,I guess I have to repeat myself?
133,&gt;We don't sequence for strain for the vast majority of people.
134,"So it's not out of 40 million cases, it's out of a MUCH smaller number."
135,What part of this are you having trouble understanding?
136,[deleted]
137,"Hopefully WI can first decrease the rate of increase in hospitalizations, because the current rate is quite rapid and concerning."
138,Big claim.
139,Juice?
140,I'm definitely not arguing his point!
141,I was genuinely confused
142,"Because it's a very small sample size and rife with problems regarding who gets tested the second time, etc."
143,11 vs. 8 or 9 people if it was just 50-50.
144,We can't draw meaningful conclusions from that.
145,"I mean eventually, even if a great vaccine is never found, we will just have to go back to normal."
146,Imagine if these pandemic's never happened?
147,The earth would be extremely overpopulated and probably close to death by now!
148,"I mean, he literally said he wore blackface so many times he can't even remember how many times he's done it, so I guess he's just bored of it now."

155,Omg.
156,"So as long as there‚Äôs something that can be defined as a pandamic, you care."
157,"The seasonal flu is the threshold, despite other causes killing millions every year."
158,Where‚Äôs your concern for the homeless living in my city?
159,"I expect to see your paychecks come to them, or else you don‚Äôt care"
160,"No, I'm specifically saying that people are selling it because it's a legitimate hemp derived product and it's legal implicitly."
161,"Also, delta-9 is expressly illegal."
162,What I'm saying is that's it's not hard to look something up.
163,"Also, that's not even a good comparison of something that's a hard narcotic."
164,I'm talking about something that is a natural byproduct.
165,Not an artificial one of man made materials.
166,I still fail to see where you're coming from.

168,Logical

171,"I found this:


&gt;More than 200 people in Australia who spent time in quarantine facilities will be urgently screened for HIV and other blood-transmitted diseases after single-use blood testing devices were mistakenly used on multiple people."
172,&gt;The mistake is thought to affect 243 people whose blood glucose levels were tested using a ‚Äúfinger prick‚Äù device in the state of Victoria between 29 March and 20 August.
173,Why are they testing blood glucose on these people?
174,Maybe they are diabetic?
175,[independent - blood test ](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/australasia/coronavirus-australia-quarantine-hiv-testing-blood-glucose-b1184299.html)
176,"TL;DR:

&gt;Two new peer-reviewed studies are showing a sharp drop in mortality among hospitalized COVID-19 patients."
177,"The drop is seen in all groups, including older patients and those with underlying conditions, suggesting that physicians are getting better at helping patients survive their illness."
178,"&gt;  
&gt;The death rate ""is still higher than many infectious diseases, including the flu,"" Horwitz says."
179,And those who recover can suffer complications for months or even longer.
180,"""It still has the potential to be very harmful in terms of long-term consequences for many people."""
181,"heck, it can take weeks from death to the death being certified and included in the statistics."
182,"Yep, this stuff takes a while."
183,"Regardless of outcome, take them to court."
184,Absolutely no excuse for this to ever happen.
185,The USA has once again had the highest number of daily new cases over the past few days.
186,"A couple weeks ago we were talking about how India would soon surpass US in confirmed cases (the country likely already exceeded the USA in actual cases a while back simply due to population size), but now that might not happen for a few more months given the trends of recent days"
187,"I hate I got downvoted to oblivion for saying people who recovered should not be forced to stay isolated for months after and that the fact that antibodies disappear doesn't mean immunity isn't real since we have B and T cells, the guy who said antibodies disappear therefore we will all get reinfected because immunity isn't real got all the upvotes (he was saying people are idiots for going out after recovering)."
188,"It seriously sucks that people still expect survivors to stay home for a months, what's the point of recovering then?"
189,"Everyone in the thread I commented on is saying ""Idiots, immunity isn't real"" and they get upvoted, and if we suggest the existence of B and T cells we get downvoted because we are covid deniers."
190,You see stuff like that in the background of black mirror episodes.
191,"I bet you won‚Äôt see main cast wear masks, but background characters/extras may wear them"
192,IE people will be really ready t spread to even more folks.
193,Subtle reminder that HIV/AIDS is still a pandemic disease that has claimed 32x the number of lives as COVID-19.
194,11/17 symptomatic individuals had worse disease the 2nd time.
195,How is that not clear?
196,Just trying to understand your interpretation.
197,"No, in fact, below the tracker I linked to:

October 19

&gt;**Health officials in Brazil are investigating at least 247 possible cases of COVID-19 reinfection, according to CNN Brazil."
198,** All of the patients tested negative in between both episodes.
199,It‚Äôs unknown how many of those cases will be subject to genomic sequencing to confirm or rule out reinfection.
200,"(Source)

&gt;**A retrospective study of confirmed cases in Mexico found 258 suspected cases of reinfection, including 11 people who died."
201,"** None of the cases were confirmed with genomic sequencing, which is one of our requirements, and thus none of them can be added to the tracker."
202,The study defined reinfection by the reappearance of COVID-19 symptoms with an interval of at least 28 days.
203,The median interval was 56 days and most were below the age of 50.
204,"Patients who were more seriously ill the first time were more likely to develop severe symptoms the second time, as well as those over the age of 50 or with chronic diseases, according to the study."
205,(Source)
206,His point is that this sub loves to virtue signal and cry about something that‚Äôs been happening since humans were alive: old people dying of viruses.
207,You could also look relatively thin and be well-marbled.
208,"I don‚Äôt look remotely overweight, but could easily lose 20-25 pounds of very well-distributed fat."
209,"In fact, I just got diagnosed with Type 2 diabetes and no one would ever use the word overweight to describe me."
210,Look at photos from 50-60 years ago.
211,Everyone looks a lot skinnier than they do today.
212,The article literally shows 24 confirmed cases out of the 40 million so far.
213,The remaining numbers are ‚Äúestimates‚Äù dated as far back as June.
214,How is it a wrong statement?
215,Reinfection with the same strain should count as proof.
216,"It‚Äôs still classified as a reinfection, correct?"
217,"Yeap Im a big fan a post apocalyptic movies, and I was very dissapointed the first few weeks."
218,Fighting over toilet paper ?

693,"None of the cases were confirmed with genomic sequencing, which is one of our requirements, and thus none of them can be added to the tracker."
694,The study defined reinfection by the reappearance of COVID-19 symptoms with an interval of at least 28 days.
695,The median interval was 56 days and most were below the age of 50.

758,Rumour says acceptance of phase 3 trial result and full scale deployment will happen as soon as end of this month.
759,"Yearly production figure will be 100 million doses per year, with China taking 20 million and 80 million distributed out to BRI countries."
760,It certainly matches up with the increasingly wide spread use of vaccines.
761,If the rumour turns out to be true then we will see the vaccine war shortly.
762,This is good news but 18% increase in survival rate for all aged group doesn't mean we should not be taking seriously.

773,If we did nothing with a still-shrinking doubling time too many haven't been infected to stop it spreading far beyond what was reached in April.
774,Europe took measures in March and April and will take them again.
775,"Even with the measures that will be taken, it's not inconceivable that April numbers could be matched overall."
776,"3 reasons

1) for some reason private labs were only required by law to report positives."
777,"2) the sisa system (the one were countrywide data gets logged)  wasn't designed to be accessed by so many people at once and has a tendency to crash, so data loggers are encouraged to priorize positive tests over negative to assure the accuracy of the first ones."
778,"in theory all end up in the data base eventually, but there is a backlog of negatives."
779,"3) there is a subcategory that if i understand correctly is ""negative, but needs to be retested because ""X"" reason"" (living with a positive for example) that doesn't end up as negative until the second test (that can be one week later) is negative as well."
780,"when it does, it goes to the database as a single negative despite geting two negative test results."
781,in the end you end up with an artificially high positivity and a artifically low testing rate.
782,"now, this issue has been aknowledged at least a month ago, but some media (both national and international) keeps using those two numbers for the headlines, so the governament announced friday that they were taking some steps to fix it."
783,"the first of those steps was adding some of the private lab data, something that apparently some interational trackers weren't aware of and causing the knejerk reaction of removing it from the db until it gets validated somehow."
784,"Increased hospitalizations leads to overloaded hospitals/ICUs capacity and staff burnout, eventually collapse of the health care system."
785,That's when people will start to drop dead at home and in the streets.
786,&gt; Within days they needed to intubate.

788,Just a quick note: You *cannot* be intubated without being put into a chemical coma.
789,You're not awake nor conscious when you're intubated.
790,"Sedating your client, is protocol."
791,"Your body fights against the tube in your trachea artificially forcing your lungs to stay inflated like a balloon, so they don't exhale and stick together like jelly."
792,"In many to most cases, you're also pronated as well, to prevent the fluid building up in your lungs, from gathering at the back or bottom of your lungs."
793,"You also can't stay intubated for more than about 16 days, because the tube erodes the inside of your trachea."
794,"We don't have replaceable parts for a throat, so if you're not improving by the time that clock rolls around, you're extubated and you have very little chance of survivability."
795,"Most people who are intubated due to SARS-CoV-2, do not make it (high 90+% mortality rate)."
796,"Those that do survive and ""recover"", do so with significantly less lung function, lifelong breathing difficulties and high risk of fibroids throwing clots and stroke risks as a result."

814,"If that‚Äôs happens, it‚Äôs fate."
815,If the vaccine is 99% effective and 99% of people get the vaccine should we socially distance and wear masks to protect the 2% who are still vulnerable?

817,"https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=d6_0mF80J90

This vid here shows that covid right now is actually ranked 17th according to the records shown in Wikipedia

That being said I think at the end of this pandemic covid might possibly kill 3 mil so it's probably going to be in the top 10 recorded ones when it's done."
818,Obviously there's way more pandemics that's probably killed tons of humans during BC era's or those that went undected but it's unrealistic to think that historians can capture a pandemic thats happened thousands of years ago.
819,"Like I said, a few people can live like that."
820,"All those people who are producing and distributing your groceries, beer, electricity, etc cannot."
821,"Czechia  905

Belgium  783

In Belgium only one party is asking for a lockdown andit's one of the least influential parties in the governement."
822,"I'm happy for Czechia that they take it serious, but Belgium really tries to become nr 1 infected / population at this rate."
823,We probably can only go in lockdown as early as monday 26 oktober because politicans first want to see which effect the current measurements have of closure of pubs and restaurants and no meeting more than 4 people a month (with social distance and one cuddling person).
824,I'm literally in an armchair.

827,He is also not a president though.
828,Easiest way to stop bullies.
829,Ignore them.
830,This is fully to be expected.
831,"We can hope for a more ideal outcome, but simple reading on the coronavirus family will tell you short lived immunity is more common than not."
832,Probability wise we should all expect periodic  re-infection to be be a problem like with most coronavirus.
833,"Maybe you still get lucky and your wrong, but it's the smarter assumption if you must make one."
834,I suggest a good guess on average immunity is 6-12 months and more than that is currently wishful thinking.
835,"As to the average consequences of reinfection, that's still up in the air."
836,I suspect a second reinfection will be similar in seriousness for most people whether that be not serious or very serious.
837,The good news there is that for most people it is a mild infection so reinfection might not have a huge multiplier effect and will be staggered by the varying degrees of average immunity.
838,Maybe we can all pack into the little piece of Minnesota that you have to go through Canada to get to.
839,Lol.
840,We can pretend.
841,The Northern Angle?
842,I can never remember what it's called.
843,Having flown recently I find this encouraging- not fool proof but encouraging
844,"Also, ""essential"" is a bullshit term."
845,"Very vague, probably intentionally so."
846,But it's not nonsense.
847,"I'm literally quoting from the study you provided, which says that there is no direct evidence that wearing a mask protects the wearer or others around them."
848,It also states that there is no evidence that wearing a mask reduces the transmission of covid.
849,"So, you got another one?"
850,I could really use more of your Google skills.
851,"I'm not aware of what happened with the southern hemisphere's winter, what was different?"
852,Peoples ignorance of how vaccination works is going to mean after they get vaccinated they are probably going to feel invincible and just do whatever they want.
853,I hope the government puts the breadcrumbs real close together and makes videos to explain why vaccination isn't going to be perfect right away.
854,At least that would affect a few peoples behavior.
855,If the vaccine is 75% effective and 75% of people get vaccinated that means 0.75x0.75 = 0.56 or 56% of the population will be protected.
856,We need to hammer this message because people will use it as an excuse to just pretend it's fine and put the rest of us at risk.
857,I feel like there's gonna be a bad time when vaccination happens and everyone takes their masks off and then neglects to get their booster shot and we have more outbreaks.
858,If we could just get our shit together and believe science....
859,I know I'm living in a fantasy world.
860,It's because of stupid fucking politicians holding campaigns and elections in the middle of a pandemic.
861,Lmao you know nothing about other countries huh?
862,They were normal for a variety of cultures already before this
863,"This is true, to a degree."
864,"But I‚Äôm guessing your uncle didn‚Äôt have significant fever, required oxygen or hospitalization."
865,"Would medical doctors from China, be a more logical choice?"
866,&gt;It isn't as rare as you think.
867,Antibodies for covid only last a few months.
868,So you can easily get it again by not wearing a mask.
869,And so this is why any time they discover someone who has been reinfected it is a huge news story?
870,"If it was ""not rare"" there would be tons of re-infections out of the 30 million people who have had Covid, and there would not be a news story any time they discovered somebody in Bangladesh or Estonia who got a re-infection."
871,"

879,Not really.

881,This is a case of a government trying to do its job to protect people.
882,"As for whether it's doing a good job, I can't really say."
883,Not to mention that the population density across the entire United States is twice that of  New Zealand.

906,"So the actual quote from the original article:

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre not going to have a profound degree of herd immunity for a considerable period of time, maybe toward the end of 2021, into 2022,‚Äù he said."

924,My guess his that at least some kids are better at learning remotely than at school.
925,I haven‚Äôt seen any studies though.
926,I suspect it will become much like the annual flu: kill a lot of people each winter but nothing like it would have killed this year because we will have widespread partial immunity due to past infections and annual vaccines.
927,Denmark?
928,It‚Äôs not that different than before.
929,Maybe a bit less people in public transportation.
930,Mandating masks in bars seems to have had the effect of there not being as much people in them(masks work?

946,"&gt; One way or another, Trump didn't survive the Virus because he's a 'fighter'."

948,How can you say that?
949,My uncle is 75 with a history of cancers.
950,He had Covid and basically just got cold symptoms.
951,"Not every 70something needs cyberware, biotech, and black magic to survive Covid."

960,Ok.
961,Your a real role model.
962,My child does not have discipline issues.
963,So step back and listen to what I said.
964,My child is perfectly happy going to the pricy private school where she goes every day all day long.

972,I can't remember which of the big 3 but I think Pfizer.... said they would know if it works or not (but not be approved yet) by the beginning of October.
973,It will take a year or two to vaccinate the entire world.
974,"I, Western upper-middle-class city resident, will receive a shot in the arm by next spring/summer."

976,Governments and entertainment providers will allow me to.
977,"The article says ""has now firmly taken hold across much of the United States"" but only cites 3 states specifically."
978,I know that cases are on the rise again and it's worrisome but I wish the reporting were a little more even.
979,I also wish the fact that the hospitalization and fatality rate is far lower than it was initially would be reported.
980,"Because we went the whole summer by around \~500 cases daily, and that's mostly in Silesia."
981,The vaccine is going to be maybe 60-75% effective.
982,So your behavior will still affect people who have been vaccinated but are just unlucky.
983,I would hate to get vaccinated and then get sick because the population thought   only anti vaxxers can still get sick.
984,thousand thanks for the updates and information compilations!
985,"Yeah, that's not going to work very well, is it?"
986,"well yes, two days ago I bought some pastries and clerk had no mask at all, she was behind plexi glass."
987,in a bakery.
988,A BAKERY.
989,"where product is not packed, but rather just sitting there ready to eat."
990,she breathed on it for hours.
991,"Congratulations, that is officially the dumbest argument I've heard all month."
992,"Well coronavirus won‚Äôt ever be eradicated, but it won‚Äôt be a pandemic forever."
993,Do you seriously think we‚Äôll have to wear masks and distance for the rest of our lives?
994,New Zealand and Taiwan have been doing great this whole time -- it may also help to be an island nation so you can more easily trace people coming in/out for quarantine
995,[removed]
996,It makes perfect sense.
997,"If you move around after 14 minutes, you can never catch the virus."
998,It's bulletproof.
999,"Well, unless you're moved to within six feet of another infected person."
1000,Then you're fucked.
1001,Nonsense.
1002,That not how this works.
1003,That's not how any of this works.
1004,&gt;but Oxford's vaccine had 100% efficacy after two doses in their Phase 1 trial.
1005,‚ÄúEfficacy‚Äù for a phase 1 trial means that people made antibodies.
1006,"They didn‚Äôt test whether those people were protected from catching the virus, which is what everyone is talking about when they‚Äôre trying to estimate how effective the vaccine will be."
1007,Not everyone in Colorado does.
1008,We have plenty of home-grown dumbasses just like every state (see the previously posted articles about places which are anti-mask as examples).
1009,We _also_ have a fair number of people visiting our national parks or getting our legal weed (and soon skiing here).
1010,"And as with any large enough group of people, some of those visiting don't wear masks or act respectfully."
1011,Very true.
1012,Why?
1013,"You make your kid wear pants , no ?"
1014,[removed]
1015,This.
1016,Waiting on a Fauci movie or book.
1017,Bless that dude.
1018,Do they test a lot more too?
1019,But either way it's still staggeringly high
1020,Also curious on this.
1021,What exactly is open/isn‚Äôt?
1022,Are office workers going in?
1023,This is why needs to happen here in the US...but our so-called leaders care more about money than they do human life.
1024,"It's like the ""six foot social distancing"" thing."
1025,"I see a lot of places like schools and churches trying to be safe by enforcing a ""six foot social distance"" between people and assuming they're now safe."
1026,"But six feet is just a rough guideline, the harder you're breathing (say, if you're talking or singing), if you're coughing (cloud up to 23 feet, according to a recent study), AC, etc can all affect how large the cloud is and make the six feet not nearly enough safety."
1027,Six feet is great if you're standing in line at the grocery store.
1028,It's not nearly enough at a movie theater.
1029,We might be able to socialize more but still have to avoid crowds and wear masks since less than half the population will truly be protected.
1030,"As a quiet person in their 40s, avoiding crowds is my normal lifestyle."
1031,"But for young people, sports fans, frequent concert goers, it's not going to be normal for them."
1032,There is no getting rid of this.

1053,"If he functioned even at 50% of a normal human being and just didn't talk and just stepped aside and let Fauci and others handle the pandemic he would literally have moonwalked his ass back into the WH, but no he had to go full clipper mode being up 3-1 with a lead."
1054,"Wait, they didn't see any pandemic yet."
1055,Lockdown today will have some effects in 2 to 4 weeks till then the graphs will go up and up...
1056,!remindme 2 years
1057,Less likely to die does not exempt people from the long term damage of Covid.....
1058,No...OPs title looks good.
1059,"""The number of cases jumped by..."" They didn't say, ""The rate jumped by..."""
1060,"Oh right, I remember that too."
1061,"Somehow I read between the lines, fired up my sewing machine for the first time in 20 years, and started researching mask patterns and materials and made masks for all my friends and family."
1062,I will never forgive US medical authorities for those early days of lying to us.
1063,what‚Äôs it like over there these days?
1064,Nah
1065,Everyone must wear N95 mask or surgical mask.
1066,Don't wear handmade mask.
1067,"If you have a cough, COVID or not, you should not be wearing a mask."
1068,You should be staying at home.
1069,Don't use masks as an excuse to socialize when you're sick.
1070,I was just talking about that the other day.
1071,If you think of the 1918 flu pandemic what visual comes to your mind first?
1072,"For me, it‚Äôs the hospital hanger type wards filled with sick and dying on the evenly lined up beds."
1073,"Now, the closest visual are the mass graves dug in Brazil and on the island in NY."
1074,"It‚Äôs sad, but true."
1075,Some of us may need to see what it‚Äôs really like in the ‚Äúhot zone‚Äù of the hospitals for it to really sink in.
1076,Just admit you're either tremendously biased or can't read (or both) and keep it pushing
1077,Dude I put the rainbow flag over my picture for pride month and did a tiktok where I said that we need change and all my 3 alternate accounts have seen it.

1119,"Let's just reset the conversation:  
There are literally hundreds of reports in the news about healthy young people who are experiencing debilitating long term effects."
1120,You sound pretty dumb and short sighted if the prospect of having a weakened heart or permanent sensory damage doesnt scare you.

1129,DC baby.
1130,That‚Äôs NE right?
1131,Lol
1132,I am not going to feel bad for somone who is warned repeatedly and yet still deliberately points the gun at their own foot and pulls the trigger because they swear bullets do not exist.
1133,If they test negative I wouldn‚Äôt worry too much but perhaps wearing a mask could give you peace of mind.
1134,"No I wouldn‚Äôt worry about transmission if they shipped things to you, don‚Äôt let the tinfoil hats on this subreddit convince you otherwise."
1135,"So, higher than last month?"
1136,"I guess ""highest since August"" sounds more dramatic."
1137,That's nice.
1138,Looks very press releasey.
1139,What they have is a test that is supposed to show if the virus is actively replicating and how high the viral load is.
1140,Assuming that works it is a stretch to assume that is all that is involved in superspreading.
1141,"It may still be a very useful test, though, assuming it works since it could determine the difference between actively shedding virions and testing positive on rtPCR due to the presence of viral debris."
1142,Think they‚Äôll need more than 5 people for this
1143,"Lockdowns and masks delay herd immunity, they don't delay a vaccine for high-risk populations."
1144,I was right we won't survive until the vaccine arrives
1145,"They might all stay open though, since they already only do takeaway service through a window."
1146,Not much spreading going on there.
1147,Exactly.
1148,I have yet to see any evidence that schools are superspreader events.
1149,Kids more likely to catch it outside of school rather than catching it in school.
1150,Assuming of course the schools are taking precautions.
1151,Just not bookstores.
1152,Lots of scientists are questioning these additional lockdowns
1153,"Honestly, this is going to sound pretty whiny and petty, but the worst part of this pandemic for me isn't having to wear a mask everywhere or socially distance in the grocery store, or even avoid eating in restaurants."
1154,Those things are annoying but doable for a year or so.
1155,"It's that all my pre-pandemic hobbies involved outdoor activities (hiking, camping, mountain biking, running, etc.)"
1156,and now it's pretty much impossible to do those things in solitude without running into crowds.
1157,Every single worthwhile outdoor activity nowadays is just mobbed beyond belief on the weekends (and even during the week after work).
1158,Even something as simple as going for a run on a nearby trail is just an exercise in dodging strollers and dog-walkers now.
1159,I don't blame any of those people - we're all forced into the same situation and trying to protect ourselves and our community.
1160,"But it's just stressful as hell and makes me want to sit inside, get fat, and wait for it all to blow over."
1161,Stop being fat America
1162,"I was being flippant - within 100 years, everyone in this thread will be dead from something... unless cryogenics really takes off!"
1163,people die everyday from all sorts of different stuff is how I look at it.
1164,All sorts of illnesses and what not so why should I concern myself about this particular source.
1165,Who says I‚Äôm against mask-wearing?
1166,Or social distancing?
1167,"I‚Äôm just saying the numbers don‚Äôt lie: the young and healthy will be overwhelmingly fine, and that mass national lockdowns are not necessary and will cause more harm than good."
1168,"&gt;o science says that this virus won‚Äôt kill or dangerously affect young, healthy adults."
1169,"The highly developed countries will probably get it faster than other countries in the world so like Western Europe, Japan/Singapore, Canada/USA/Australia."
1170,"So basically ""first-world"" countries total to what 1.5 billion or so?"
1171,Let's round up to 2 billion for numbers sake....so 7.6 million doses per day that roughly 8 - 9 months to vaccine those people.
1172,But yeah getting it out to the people who live in like Tibet - that's going to be a major pain in the ass
1173,10.000 hospitalized is massive üò≥
1174,"Well, I have a busted wheel in a bike repair shop right now that I was supposed to pick up tomorrow and that seems like it isn't going to happen based on this list."
1175,"&gt;Parent's think they get a free pass for anything

1179,No I think arbitrarily closing businesses and allowing people‚Äôs livelihoods to crumble while you sit back collecting unemployment benefits and advocating murder charges is the real crime.
1180,Mass protests?
1181,No problem.
1182,I want to be free to run my own business?
1183,Charge me with murder.

1214,No we don't
1215,"it would only take years if we didn't have vaccines or medications in the works, but there should be one of the above to help significantly derail COVID by the end of 2021."
1216,Especially since the goal for positivity is under 5%.
1217,"You know, half of what that idiot thought."
1218,"&gt;they don't talk about Corona being Airborne

wait  


how do they think it transmits then??"
1219,it's a virus that travels through the air.
1220,isn't that airborne by definition?
1221,"It's almost as if SARS-Cov-2 is a respiratory virus that is transmissible by airborne droplet, and that airborne transmission is more likely in colder weather where people are indoors more often and/or the virus can remain suspended in the air for longer because of a lower relative humidity."
1222,*Perfect*
1223,Dorms are kind of a mix bag.
1224,"Where I work, they managed to put everyone in an individual room for the time being."
1225,And you're not wrong about it being a waste of money.
1226,"Yeah, but you still took massive measures compared to my country."
1227,We had no lockdown whatsoever and no mask mandates or even mask recommendations.
1228,The only real restriction is the 50 person event limit.
1229,And we see people breaking the rules all over the world right now.
1230,Trump and the rallies are obviously not making it better but the US is not unique in this regard.
1231,"The real question is ""what the hell is wrong with the world?"
1232,"""."
1233,"Well indoors is where the vast majority of transmission happens, so it should not matter much that it's not mandated outdoors."
1234,"Masks ""while consuming"" would not work anyway, so as long as pubs are open, what would be the solution?"
1235,I agree they should have been closed!
1236,But you can't solve those just with masks.
1237,"However, last winter we also started with 0% immunity where as now some former hotspots are at 25+%, nobody wearing masks, packed public transit, and no idea how to treat it."
1238,The first wave immunity in places like NYC will likely be useful.
1239,Is it herd immunity?
1240,"No, not even close."
1241,But think about who would be the most likely to get infected and also lost likely to be super spreaders.
1242,Those people are likely already immune.
1243,"Of course it will still spread to the vast majority of the population that isn't, but at a much slower rate if most of the bus drivers, delivery people, cashier's etc have already had it."
1244,I'm really sorry to hear that.
1245,Hang in there.
1246,"Easily believed, even the grocery stores here that were good about mask enforcement have given up."
1247,Not going inside another building unless absolutely necessary.
1248,What's a lollipop tree?
1249,"‚ÄúSevere heart damage has occurred in young, healthy people, but is rare.‚Äù"
1250,Nope.
1251,Overpopulation is a [myth](https://youtu.be/QsBT5EQt348)
1252,We also have to figure out what to do with people who have long term effects.
1253,We can‚Äôt really support them forever... the US has a lot of them and no game plan.
1254,"No universal health care, and no willpower to accept higher taxes for all these people‚Äôs care."
1255,This is going to burden the economy more than the closures long term.
1256,This reopening is essentially a predatory loan from a financial perspective.
1257,"Omg as a teacher, comments like the one above saying ‚Äúteachers JuSt DoNT WanNA go to WoRk‚Äù kill me."
1258,Ive never worked harder in my LIFE than now doing distance learning.
1259,(And now hybrid bc my school is allowing small groups of kids to come back)
1260,"Young and antisocial here, would have no problem having an excuse to avoid people!"
1261,"Vaccinating risk groups would greatly reduce the fatality rate, yes."
1262,But young people spreading it between each other unrestrictedly would still carry the potential of overwhelming the hospital system.
1263,"Like, imagine an entire concert hall's worth of people getting infected all at once."
1264,How can a title actually be this misleading
1265,Uber is now investigating a replacement workforce.
1266,I mean the virus barely cares for people under 40
1267,It's killing me not decorating.
1268,"We got pumpkins and I'm going to carve them and light them up, but our porch lights will be out."
1269,"Giving out candy is one of my absolute favorite things, and I've been going over all of the ideas of distancing and trying to do it safely."
1270,But I came to the conclusion that I didn't want to reward the parents who had made a bad choice by taking their kids out.
1271,"Yes, the kids aren't going to have a standard Halloween, but no holidays have been normal since Valentines Day."
1272,It's just reality.
1273,"I mean, yeah, I would love to be comfortable enough to give out candy, but people in the US were ding-dongs and decided to prioritize ""muh freedumbs"" instead of just hunkering down for a few weeks."
1274,Nothing is normal right now and trick or treating is just another casualty.
1275,Kids will survive it.
1276,"Deaths back in the hundreds, my mental health that I lost in the lockdown was for nothing"
1277,We are still on the 1st wave.
1278,And it's a little bit of everything.
1279,"People have pandemic fatigue, and the government is not doing their part."
1280,There was never nor there will be a proper lockdown.
1281,Everyone is getting complacent about it.
1282,Yet no covid relief and things are worse than ever
1283,"Canadian dropping in to say, yes it is valid, in the United States."
1284,Not worldwide.
1285,You could say the same thing about the flu.
1286,"I‚Äôm not calling covid the flu, but both can kill anyone, be spread to anyone, and hurt someone badly."
1287,That is... not what I said.
1288,"The phrase ""dig my heels in"" implies that I have a firm stance."
1289,It also just really undermines my point when you purposefully paraphrase in a negative way like that.

1295,I realized I could google this for myself inst of being lazy and asking someone else for a link :P so I looked it up and found the science mag article myself.
1296,Interesting stuff so far
1297,"I would argue, if your body needs to be capable of fighting infections in order to stay alive, and your body cannot fight infection anymore, then yes a virus or whatever may have killed you, but the underlying reason is your bodies inability to fight infection."
1298,"Obviously in the case of HIV, the virus directly effects your bodies ability to fight disease."
1299,Ah yes.
1300,Let‚Äôs shut down the word for a disease that has an ifr of .5% and an average age of death of 80.
1301,And please spare me your ‚Äúpermanent organ damage‚Äù articles from random news sources
1302,Wtf?
1303,Is this how anti-maskers think?
1304,Relax edgelord
1305,You are wrong.
1306,Please stop saying such asinine things.
1307,"If you are hypertensive, and envelop COVID, end up on a respirator and die 6 weeks later, you didn‚Äôt die for the hypertension."
1308,You died from the COVID.
1309,"Even if that 6 weeks on a respirator allowed you to slowly improve and and you go home, the long term effects, including chronic respiratory issues from long term respirator use, aren‚Äôt from the hypertension."
1310,They are from COVID and respirator use.
1311,I‚Äôm old.
1312,I can slip and fall on ice more easily.
1313,"But if I fall and break my leg, it‚Äôs not because I slip and fall easily."
1314,"It‚Äôs because there was ice I did fall on, and fell in such a fashion that there was enough force to break a bone."
1315,Comorbities don‚Äôt cause a death.
1316,"In the absence of COVID, the person would not have died."
1317,"Welcome to permanent lockdown, Czech Republic!"

1319,Mainly to talk about what their criteria will be.
1320,Both manufacturers have people clearing their schedule to attend but their data won't be ready till November and December respectively
1321,Yeah but when you surround yourself with dumb dumbs that don‚Äôt wear masks and social distance then you get these super spreader events.
1322,Doubt that‚Äôll just stop happening as this virus continues running through all the dumb dumbs.
1323,i personally consider things back to normal
1324,That fear is gone now.
1325,No one is scared of COVID anymore.
1326,Two weeks to party???
1327,Count me in!
1328,Maybe if someone in our household has it...but otherwise no way.
1329,We would also isolate the person.
1330,Clearly if you can‚Äôt isolate...bigger reason to wear a mask.
1331,"&gt;The correct decision, won‚Äôt stop anyone from getting the virus anyway

That's just stupid."
1332,How is this still hard to grasp for some people?
1333,In the past 48 hours I've seen three people die after an asymptomatic college student came to work.
1334,Known case numbers at the college are currently well over 100.
1335,Do you believe that being a student somehow limits the ability to shed and infect others?
1336,Do you think it's coincidence that numbers have climbed sharply since schools got going again?
1337,"This is likely to be one of the easiest, least brutal flu seasons ever."
1338,All the  mitigation in place for COVID also helps fight the spread of flu.
1339,Bullshit
1340,Covid is here to stay people.
1341,Vaccine or not.
1342,The kind that does nothing against coronavirus.

1421,Lol.
1422,"The whole picture would not just focus on deaths, but also those that ""recovered"" but still have health issues from the disease, perhaps including the financial burden that those that ""survive"" now live with."
1423,The whole picture would include data on what was learned about transmission through contact tracing.
1424,Contract tracing that has been largely absent due to a host of failures in political leadership.
1425,Etc.
1426,"If relaxation of restrictions is causing Europe to have a massive second spike despite the first lockdown getting it under control, why do people continually claim that the US would have normal life again if only we had locked down better in the spring and summer?"
1427,"It seems clear lockdowns work, but only if you stay locked down forever"
1428,"Ok, but the country won't collapse, right?"
1429,Hence the lockdown is not absolutely required.
1430,"Brazil has been 100% open for many months now, how come the lockdown wasn't ""mandatory"" there?"

1434,Not sure if you‚Äôre aware but people haven‚Äôt seen family/friends in months.

1439,"Then there‚Äôs the other side who will do these measures because they have the privilege of being financially and mentally fine right now,  and who want things to be ‚Äúperfect‚Äù which could take a year or more."

1452,The low bar we are trying to meet with this first generation of vaccines is to prevent severe illness.
1453,It is a bad sign if it didn't do this in someone 28 years old.
1454,It‚Äôs because it‚Äôs not normal.

1473,Well said.

1560,"There are ways to lower the dangers of covid drastically without ""destroying society."""

1562,450 deaths TOTAL in a population of ~50 Million.
1563,That is about 70 times less deaths per capita than the US.
1564,70 TIMES.
1565,But isn‚Äôt it also a shame that this happens because people are so god damn stupid they can‚Äôt bother to read information or ask questions or think rationally?
1566,If something like this article causes WW3 just let us die.
1567,"&gt;This is now the 3rd wave of hospitalizations and since the 2nd never broke the record from the first wave, it is very likely this 3rd will fizzle out too."
1568,"Also, the second wave didn't ""fizzle."""
1569,Deaths went up by a lot.
1570,"In think that you are missing a basic thing here:  In March/April, we didn't have much testing."
1571,The same number of CONFIRMED cases in July or right now means fewer ACTUAL cases than that number of confirmed cases in March.
1572,That doesn't mean that the death rate has changed much.
1573,"&gt;On Wednesday, the state was reporting 534 hospitalizations, up from 501 on Tuesday ‚Äî another daily state record."
1574,"In the past 24 hours, 90 patients have been admitted."

1621,"&gt;The number of patients hospitalized statewide for known or suspected COVID-19 cases was at 832 on Tuesday, up from 777 inpatients on Monday."
1622,Tuesday's 832 inpatients was the highest reported since Aug. 26.
1623,"At the peak of Arizona's surge in July, the number of hospitalized patients suspected or confirmed to have the virus exceeded 3,000."
1624,"&gt;The number of patients with suspected or known COVID-19 in intensive care units across Arizona was at 171 on Tuesday, compared with 170 on Monday and 177 on Sunday, which was the highest it's been since Sept. 11."
1625,"The level is far below what it was in July, when ICU beds in use for COVID-19 reached 970."
1626,"&gt; Iowa reported record high COVID-19 deaths Wednesday, with 31 people  dying of the novel coronavirus along with¬†an additional 1,276¬†confirmed  cases."
1627,"The state also reported 534 people hospitalized, topping  Tuesday's high of 501."
1628, yeah definitely agree with  that.
1629,Pretty sad because Europe was doing so well for so long and they seem to have just given up.
1630,I've honestly been impressed with what Cuomo has been doing in New York.
1631,Let's see if he can maintain it but he has shut down areas in Brooklyn and suburbs where the Orthodox Jewish community has allowed the virus to spiral out of control.
1632,So it seems like he has a pretty good pulse on the situation and is shutting down the hotspots relatively quickly.
1633,Just for an example Cuomo is shutting down anywhere that has a higher than three percent positivity rate for a week.
1634,Compare that to areas the rest of the country and it's just kind of ridiculous.
1635,So hopefully he can keep it up.
1636,I just wish there was some type of national response that can be similar to what he is doing.
1637,I had a lot of criticism for how we handle the virus initially but I have to give him credit I think he's done a pretty damn good job since but let's  see if he can keep it up
1638,"Lol you guys seem to only see it in certain articles, but all covid19 related articles are designed this way."
1639,I mean in the intrest of self preservation wouldnt it make sense to not wanna take a vaccine if some people randomly dropped dead during the human trials?
1640,There‚Äôs really not much you can do other than wear the best mask you can and wash your hands.

1663,"Sorry for the question sounding daft if it does, but do they infect you with the virus after the vaccine to see if it‚Äôs effective or do they just wait to see if you catch it socially and how it goes after that?"
1664,I‚Äôm just trying to understand how they actually test the effectiveness of the vaccine after they give it to you.
1665,So much fear mongering and stupid human-sheepleness going on.

1681,"&gt; Unlike other viruses that have emerged in the past two decades, coronaviruses are highly recombinogenic14,15,16."
1682,"Influenza viruses reassort17 but they do not undergo homologous recombination within RNA segments18,19, meaning that origins questions for influenza outbreaks can always be reduced to origins questions for each of influenza‚Äôs eight RNA segments."
1683,"For coronaviruses, however, recombination means that small genomic subregions can have independent origins, identifiable if sufficient sampling has been done in the animal reservoirs that support the endemic circulation, co-infection and recombination that appear to be common."
1684,"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7130985/

The major difference is just that there's no other strain of SARS-CoV-2 circulating in humans for the pandemic strain to swap genetic material with."
1685,It can only swap mutations with itself.
1686,I legit just saw someone inside a grocery store not wearing their mask being told to leave in Dallas.
1687,"Even though Dallas is more democratic, doesn't mean there aren't idiots here."
1688,"Our numbers are already in the red, and hospitalizations and cases continue to go up rapidly."
1689,"There's zero talk of a March shutdown since Dallas County no longer has that authority, with Abbott basically neutering all the cities in an attempt to appease the radical tea party members of the GOP."
1690,"At this rate within maybe a month, hospitals are going to have to start triaging and sending people home to legit die."
1691,I‚Äôd be very careful about taking advice from someone on Reddit vs 2 doctors.
1692,"Damn, that sounds rough."
1693,I'm so sorry you had to go through that.
1694,But I'm really happy you did eventually get connected with a capable neurologist!
1695,And it's wonderful to hear you're doing so much better now.
1696,:) I've heard of Xyrem doing some amazing things for people and I'm glad it's worked for you too.
1697,I guess I was dealt a pretty lucky hand with my first (and still current) neurologist.
1698,She's smart as hell and extremely compassionate.
1699,"She sees very few patients with narcolepsy &amp; cataplexy, so she's always very interested in how I'm managing."
1700,I'm also in the US and I'm fucking dreading losing my insurance next year when I turn 26.
1701,"Luckily, the hospital my neurologist is at takes Medicaid‚Äîotherwise I'd be pretty screwed!"
1702,It's hell for sure.
1703,"Even though I'm adequately medicated now, most days are still tough."
1704,It's not an easy illness and it's even harder when few people have any idea about what it even is.
1705,"I've got hope, though, that some of the misconceptions around Narcolepsy might get turned around someday!"
1706,Project Sleep and More Than Tired have been really on the ball the past couple of years working to raise public awareness about sleep disorders.
1707,"I saw one of More Than Tired's commercials on TV last year and it almost brought a tear to my eye, lol."
1708,"College towns all across the country are spiking this fall, and it‚Äôs the local communities themselves suffering the brunt of the inevitable COVID outbreaks."
1709,Many of these towns had it relatively under control before classes started and students mass gathered.
1710,Colleges had to have known this would happen.
1711,But I guess many didn‚Äôt care.
1712,Challenged trials for covid so far have been declared evil and unethical.
1713,Things could change.
1714,I'm sorry but that's an entirely different issue.
1715,Does the CDC have the authority to mandate masks or recommended them?
1716,or creates lots of clicks now and even more later
1717,"a second nationwide lockdown would eradicate economy to post-war levels... virus gone, famines come."
1718,Not that I know of.

1727,Now we are irremediably between a rock and a hard place.
1728,Well some people think the only precaution is no precautions.
1729,No.
1730,To test effectivness you get a whole bunch of people.
1731,"You give the real vaccine to some, like 2/3 of them, and give a fake vaccine (placebo) to the rest and watch them."
1732,After there have been a bunch of infections you see which group had the most.
1733,If it works as hoped the vaccinated ones will have few and the fake vaccine group will have a bunch.
1734,This demonstrates that the vaccine actually prevented infections.
1735,That‚Äôs a challenge trial and (understandably) are reserved for emergency situations as they have grave ethical implications.

1744,You're welcome for my service.
1745,";-)  
  
Seriously though, my motivation was that if I can do something that might help get my kids back to school even 1 minute sooner, I'm all in."
1746,Don't forgot the classic YOUR KILLING GRANDMAS!!!
1747,everything you leave your house.
1748,i‚Äôd recommend you read around the internet to see just how much this field of study has changed over the years.
1749,there‚Äôs some great material out by doctors working specifically with obesity.
1750,"the mantra of diet + exercise = results is antiquated at this point in time and frankly, bad advice for someone really overweight or obese."
1751,"proper nutrition varies from person to person, that sadly requires a lot of money to find your right balance."
1752,"in fact, exercise really isn‚Äôt that great for weight loss, though it is a super drug for overall health."
1753,"getting an obese person to take a 15 gentle minute walk every hour or two, for example, followed by journaling how said walk makes them feel is enormously more effective than training them until they are exhausted over the course of 30mins-1hr and then telling them to eat some protein and veggies."
1754,"though it‚Äôs an inspiring story you mentioned, it is not really enough...and herein lies the problem with many fitness professionals, which i will digress from rambling aside from this: MORE THAN HALF OF PEOPLE THAT LOSE WEIGHT WILL GAIN IT BACK."
1755,there is no success story that we can draw upon to avoid this reality.
1756,all diets are hard on the immune system.
1757,the real success stories are when a person changes their lifestyle and their entire way of thinking about things.
1758,that kind of work takes a lot more dedication than a simple diet.
1759,"to lots of people struggling with obesity it‚Äôs insulting to have someone tell them to count their calories, eat well and get some more exercise."
1760,i literally gave a presentation on this kind of stuff to some seniors i work for yesterday.
1761,almost all of them have tried to lose weight (though not all are obese/overweight) and failed in some way or another.
1762,all of them are sedentary for large portions of the day.
1763,all of them were shocked to realize what even 30 minutes of sedentary behavior can do to us.
1764,"all of them were shocked to see just how beneficial regular movement is, and walked away more motivated as a result."
1765,"again, nutrition/exercise is important, it is not the golden ticket to weight loss."
1766,you can be in a calorie deficit by eating baked potato chips all day long....and people 100% do this.
1767,you can also be obese and in literal starvation mode.
1768,forcing a deficit on an obese person generally makes them want to eat and hoard food MORE.
1769,a person that works from a desk 8 hours a day and then does more of the same for the rest of the night day in-day out without adequate movement WILL hit a plateau that no diet or exercise around will penetrate.
1770,"again, there is so much fascinating new findings that show this to us."
1771,happy days to ya.
1772,[deleted]
1773,So if you got it each year for 75 years you have a 2.2% probability of dying before the age of 75.
1774,"Heck life expectancies have gone too high anyway, this could solve all our pension problems."
1775,Technical analysis is useless enough for stocks and crypto.
1776,It's even more of a total joke when we're talking about an infectious disease.
1777,Actually last week had highers numbers so look like the country will maybe stagnate at 30k and then go down with the measures afraid of the dead and icu
1778,You're more right than you think with the Australian example.
1779,Our second outbreak was only in one state (mine) and most of the country was covid free and had closed borders until Victoria eliminates (or nearly eliminates) the virus.
1780,"We had our ""learn to live with it"" crowd, but listening to them had the additional problem of being cut off from the rest of the country."
1781,Eliminating it here means I might be able to visit family in another state for Christmas.
1782,where does diarrhea and malaria place on this chart?
1783,"Over 40,000 people under 65 have died from Covid-19 in 7 months and deaths are still going up


So over 4 times the 2017/2018 flu season."
1784,And 17/18 was one of the highest years in the past 10 years.
1785,https://www.statista.com/statistics/1127698/influenza-us-deaths-by-age-group/
1786,"When we‚Äôre told for months ‚Äúwe need to wait for a vaccine,‚Äù the emergence of the vaccine will be what ends the pandemic in the minds of pretty much everyone."
1787,Moving the goalposts again simply will not be tolerated by most people.
1788,"Well, from this comment I guess we should bail on the vaccine then."
1789,Time to take the fuck it approach!
1790,"Maybe talk to your doctor like any sane, rational human being would"
1791,Good job remembering words?
1792,"Boomers are weirdly into covid denial, considering their risk factors."
1793,And I agree while lockdowns are in place they keep numbers low.
1794,But as soon as they are lifted they shoot right back up.
1795,So as WHO has said they are not a viable long term solution to the problem.
1796,They just make it the futures problem.
1797,The whole point of the first lock dow  was to prepare for the second wave.
1798,So why are we locking down again just to have a 3rd wave?
1799,A 4th?
1800,It's an endemic.
1801,It's not going anywhere.
1802,Everyone on the planet over x amount of time well have covid.
1803,So why draw it out
1804,I wear one now and I said after the vaccine exists.
1805,Because it will never go away so do we wear it forever and ever?
1806,Does it never stop?
1807,Why are you so fucking rude for no fucking reason?
1808,We‚Äôve always existed with diseases and never destroyed society for them.
1809,People like you love masks to be smug and control and degrade other people.
1810,"In a world where catching one person in public spreading the disease could literally save millions, catching anything is worth it, especially when it's none invasive."
1811,Is there any other way?
1812,Let's hope the virus is the shy type.
1813,the selfish behaviour of many younger people in this pandemic should haunt everyone.
1814,Decent is code for mediocre and irrelevant outside the Covid-scenario?
1815,"&gt;  I'm not one of those conspiracy theorists who believes there's a media plot to keep us all terrified, but there's been so much wilfully dishonest reporting and cherry picking from scientific studies since March."
1816,It doesn't have to be a conspiracy.
1817,Media is a business and terror and attention makes money.
1818,"*Especially* with online advertising-funded news where they make money literally *from the click*, and by extension people sharing it on social media, and not from subscription patronage."
1819,The conspiracy is if you think it's an organized effort based on a sinister agenda.
1820,But each new company finds the same money-making model in its own way.
1821,It's like tabloids that lie about celebrities.
1822,There isn't a conspiracy against celebrities it's just that tons of people want to read that shit.
1823,It sells.
1824,"In my opinion the big question is if the details in the reporting are at least fundamentally truthful, even if they're spun or sensationalized, because then at least we're getting real news we can do something with."
1825,Not like FOX or other actual conspiracy garbage.
1826,For what it's worth getting a hang of which news sources try a little harder to maintain journalistic integrity despite the short term financial pressures means you get to flat-out ignore most errant headlines you come across on the internet.
1827,Actually we don't know the vaccine works.
1828,That is the point of phase 3 trial.
1829,We supposedly know it is reasonably safe from phase 2.
1830,I think our state can mitigate economic fallout and letting spread get out of control will ruin the economy more thoroughly than taking action now.
1831,[removed]
1832,Photoshop
1833,"He also cites the [WHO school guidance](https://www.who.int/news-room/q-a-detail/q-a-schools-and-covid-19) as evidence that school reopenings are safe, despite the fact that the WHO says there isn't enough evidence to assess the amount of spread caused by schools."
1834,"They also say school reopenings should be based on the amount of community spread, i.e."
1835,"not off the table, and that masks should be worn by everyone over 12, which I am sure looked like a foreign language to DeSantis."
1836,Why are we even studying and putting money into vaccines if they‚Äôre so ineffective and not likely to help?
1837,How much would you bet that this horrific news doesn't get much air time in America or other places outside of Latin America?
1838,In Italy public transportation is packed at all times.
1839,Public transportation is a big problem here.
1840,It's kinda what they did with the 1918 pandemic.
1841,The struggles of those who actually survived were ignored.
1842,"One of my mom's uncles was a child who survived that pandemic, just barely."
1843,He basically ended up having MR afterward.
1844,But nobody ever talked about it in my family.
1845,I put two and two together as an adult.
1846,The daily rate of case growth in the European Union is significantly higher that the growth rate for the US.
1847,"It must be more than the UK, Spain, France and Italy that are pushing the UE numbers."
1848,Where else is growth high in the EU?

1850,Mistaken.
1851,No ill intent.

1856,"For those of us who are in the study, we get monthly medical exams."
1857,We get weekly phone calls with researchers.
1858,We take daily health readings.
1859,We have a phone number to call if we are feeling sick.
1860,"And if we are sick, we get care from some of the best people in the hospital."
1861,"Is it possible that someone in their 20s did everything right, got the virus, and died?"
1862,Absolutely.
1863,"But I can also see someone in Brazil socializing, having fun, not telling anyone thinking they‚Äôll be ok because they‚Äôre immune, and dying."
1864,"If you‚Äôre that young and you die, it‚Äôs most likely from either a compromised immune system, which would disqualify you from most studies and would be detected when they take blood at the start of the study or delayed medical care."
1865,"I‚Äôm not being harsh, I‚Äôm being realistic."
1866,"If that offends you, meh."
1867,"As I tell my wife, the purpose of tv programs is to get you to watch commercials."
1868,Likewise Internet news sites.
1869,Probably depends on the size of the firm.
1870,"Businesses with less than 50 employees don‚Äôt have to provide benefits, for example."
1871,So your local coffee shop might be it be expected to provide masks.
1872,Not great news but can't worry too much about something that may or may not happen.
1873,It gets clicks.
1874,I don't think you understand how the economy and society works.
1875,You can't just pause it.
1876,It's not a video game.
1877,"They've been mandatory indoors since the end of the lockdown, then we got mandatory outdoors masks in the evenings (from 6 pm)."
1878,Interesting.

1917,did you swallow your food first?
1918,Not the publics fault.
1919,People aren't paid enough and healthy alternatives are priced higher than cheap shit.
1920,It is not true of all viruses - many do spread efficiently via surfaces.
1921,"I‚Äôm not sure about cold viruses but if you‚Äôre absolutely sure that your son didn‚Äôt have direct contact with someone with a cold, then that was probably surface transmission, as you think."
1922,"Just as a heads up, there‚Äôs growing evidence that coronavirus is airborne and also spreads efficiently via leftover aerosol particles, particularly indoors, so be very mindful of that as well and ensure that you don‚Äôt go to or stay long in poorly ventilated indoor environments."
1923,Mehhhhh don't think I'd like to remember much from this pandemic
1924,They are getting complacent.
1925,At this point there is no excuse.
1926,"if south korea and taiwan and hong kong can avoid the virus without even locking down and managed to set up formidable test and trace operations within weeks, there is no excuse for any advance economy to not have a plan by now."
1927,Thanks for all you do as a teacher - arguably *the* most important job in the world.
1928,"The World Health Organization, and other public health bodies, say the test positivity rate should be 5% or less for at least two weeks before it's safe for a region to reopen."
1929,"This is highly relevant to schools because despite what you do inside the school (short of sealing it in a hermetic bubble), the community transmission rate - what's happening on the outside - will impact what happens inside the school."
1930,Unfortunately we've seen too many districts reopen schools when community transmission is still high.
1931,"While this may not be too bad for the children (who have lower infection rates and lower rates of severe disease and death than adults), it can be disastrous for the adults they expose."
1932,So it all comes back to getting the virus under control in a particular region before the schools can safely reopen.
1933,Slows might be an understatement with a global pandemic.
1934,NO TAXATION WITHOUT REPRESENTATION
1935,The FDA is requiring a minimum number of severe COVID in trial participants (I believe it may be 5).
1936,The people need to be in the trial to count and would hopefully be in the placebo arm.

1940,"I think the people who say that either work from home, have a family, or a significant other or some combination of the three."
1941,I live alone and am single and I've been having dinner with my family friday and Saturday night since this started.
1942,There are times where I don't speak to any other human being for a week in between seeing my family.
1943,I recently started looking for a job again once my unemployment ran out and I think that will help but goddamn am I depressed.
1944,I sure as hell can't do social distancing indefinitely.
1945,Not to mention that a lot of young people have given up a year of their lives to protect the good of society but I don't think it's fair to ask them to do that indefinitely.
1946,Online learning is a poor substitute for in person learning.
1947,Video chatting with friend/family is a poor substitute for human connection.
1948,I wouldn't mind wearing masks in public for however long but a socially distanced world is not a place I want to live in.

1957,Hi Dr. Yasmin.
1958,Just out of curiosity what are your thoughts on your colleague Dr. Jay B ?
1959,Thank you for your answer
1960,The concept of using a placebo stems from two main tenants of modern medicine: 1.
1961,"Do no harm, which is a slight misnomer because almost all therapies have some level of risk/side effects associated with them."
1962,"Thus, a given treatment's benefits should out-weigh the risks and perceived downsides."
1963,2.
1964,"The placebo effect, or rather, the power of the human mind's expectation of benefit from a treatment, \*even from a treatment that is known to be useless\* is the next step up from not doing anything."
1965,A sham treatment is the lowest possible intervention that could produce a benefit with no risk whatsoever.
1966,Don't underestimate this: studies have even shown that there can be improved outcomes even when patients are explicitly told they are receiving a mock treatment that is not the real thing.
1967,"Thus, the least risky intervention is simply giving someone a sugar pill and saying it will help them."
1968,"All new therapies have to show that their risks are worth it and produce statistically better results than just a placebo alone, since a placebo treatment is the best solution to the concept of ""Do no Harm""."
1969,"That is, until it can be shown that the risks of a therapy are worth the benefits."
1970,"An ELI5 of this would say that you need to assess if a vaccine offers statistically significant protection compared to administering saline injections, since if we started a large-scale administration of saline injections as a treatment there would be a non-zero improvement in protection from the virus."
1971,"Not quite sure if I explained it well enough or not, and I just saw your edit so I guess I just wasted all the time typing this up."
1972,[removed]
1973,"PRC, VN, AUS and NZ have eradicated the virus."
1974,RoK has it supressed.
1975,We are just the one-eyed among the blind and the cost of flattening the curve during the cold season will be far greater than a South-Korean style TTI system or even a PRC style hard lockdown.
1976,"hopefully people wait a few weeks after ""it's over"" to do that haha"
1977,I can do you one better anecdotally: I got pneumonia in 2014.
1978,"It permanently raised my blood pressure, which is still high in spite of years of meds, and it accidentally (as in it showed up in an ultrasound) led to a thyroid cancer diagnosis."
1979,"That thyroid cancer resulted in having my parathyroid glands damaged when my thyroid was removed, so now I can no longer absorb calcium from any food."
1980,Took years for my Endo to figure out that last part.
1981,The prize for getting my constant fatigue taken seriously?
1982,Pills for lyfe!!!

1997,Are we still 2 weeks behind Italy like the early days in May?
1998,"/somewhatsarcasm

I remember watching Italy's numbers so closely in May, knowing that the US was 2 weeks behind them and following the same pattern."
1999,I wonder where the US stands now in terms of following other countries second wave footsteps.
2000,[deleted]
2001,UF?
2002,it is my understanding they are telling professors that if they aren't willing to do in person teaching they can retire.
2003,They are forgetting it is the older professors who bring in research $ to the school and are part of the reason for the academic rank.
2004,"Yep, Pfizer is really blowing it out of the water, they already have 40k people that have gotten the first dose of the vaccine, and 34k have gotten the 2nd dose of the vaccine."
2005,"Their original goal was 30k people, but then they increased it to 44k people, and now I think they increased it again to 48k to include 4k kids."
2006,I'd say that Crisis Management 101 (just look at any CM textbook) says the following: every crisis is a crisis of information.
2007,"If you lose control of the information, you lose control of the crisis."
2008,"This means that communicating to the public about what is happening, what we should expect to see happen in the coming weeks/months, and what every person can do to protect themselves and their country."
2009,"Unfortunately, we've seen repeat blunders of the pandemic response and a lack of any cohesive messaging."

2011,"yauy here we go 35% unemployment and mass bankruptcy , deterioration of the currency everyone loses everything they've saved up !"
2012,thousands die from the medical system collapsing under its costs and all the elderly get pension cuts so they half starve ...  my point being another lockdown of the same form as the first would one shot kill the entire economy in a rather painful longe lasting way.
2013,"Yeah, it's a pretty stupid idea."
2014,  I think they would have to un-blind as they go?
2015,I thought they wanted at least 50+ number of placebo infections before releasing phase III results.
2016,"Or, is it just 50 total regardless of placebo?"
2017,"Well it's almost 8 months that I pass inside, if they go insane it won't came from me"

2028,"FloriDUH hasn't updated their numbers yet today and the gubbenor is talking about stopping daily updates, so there's that."
2029,"(numbers come out around 11:30, so 5 hours late)"
2030,That sounds really dumb.
2031,Why even go inside the hospital?
2032,Even if one at a time?
2033,"That means you could be touching surfaces or holding up hospital staff or infecting other hospital people, and I'm guessing they would need to regularly do more work to disinfect inside and outside every few min/hrs."
2034,Also fuck standing in line and waiting when you can just sit in parked car and wait.
2035,In Vic(melb) we have drive through and they do it in car parks in every suburb or two.
2036,"You don't get out your car, they swab you and that's it."
2037,It's not even hospital staff but trained testers.
2038,If you test you stay home and wait however long and they pay you for the time you had to wait if you miss work so it encourages people to get tested.
2039,Same if you test positive
2040,Well then it‚Äôs gonna be many many years before in person classes can resume.
2041,"&gt; Nah, worst case would be that reinfections are always worse each subsequent time."
2042,Sure.
2043,"But throw in food shortages, war, broken supply chains, collapsing infrastructure and civil unrest for a more comprehensive idea of what a worst-case scenario might entail."
2044,florida had this problem for a while.
2045,so people numbered 1-10 get in line.
2046,"number 7 tests positive but number 5 left early, so at the end of the day you get positive results sent to the person who was 8th in line and negative results sent to the person who was originally 7 (now 6)"

2052,"Lol, which one is it?"
2053,so inconsistent.
2054,Anti-vaccine campaigns were already a problem before the pandemic.
2055,"They've gotten worse, especially among those people who fear the science is being rushed."
2056,(I'd argue the science IS being doing as quickly as possible but that safety is not being compromised.
2057,"In fact, the pausing of some vaccine trials is proof that safety is being taken very seriously.)"
2058,"By the way, caveats to all of this include the Russian vaccine trials for which there has not been transparency or data sharing."
2059,"One strategy is to remind people of the following: 1) Anti-vaccine groups are taking advantage of the current crisis to foment even more distrust in science 2) Yes, the trials are being done as quickly as possible but safety testing is still a critical part of them 3) We should all anticipate even more anti-vaccine content to circulate online and in our communities because anti-vaccine groups are exploiting our fear."
2060,"This last point especially can help people by giving them a heads up that we *should* expect more anti-vaccine content to spread and we need to pause, take a breath, verify the source of the information and be even more critical before we believe or RT or forward information about vaccines."

2069,Herd immunity.
2070,Let's let the virus run rampant so that everyone gets diabetes and then dies from it 6 months later when they're no longer immune.
2071,I think k12 schools are probably one of the things driving the resurgence we are seeing.
2072,"They are prime conditions for spreading and, as we know, kids may not necessarily show symptoms, so it can be hard to outwardly identify anyone who may be positive."
2073,"Should the current occupant of the White House be kicked out, the new administration should seek to implement closures of any schools receiving federal funding."
2074,"I‚Äôm sure there will be some court battles, but I don‚Äôt see why this shouldn‚Äôt pass muster."

2077,As a non-European I've got absolutely no problem with that EU decision for whatever reason they deem necessary.
2078,"But it does seem odd to my admittedly non-expert understanding, given the current regional [positivity rates](https://ourworldindata.org/coronavirus-testing)."
2079,"Canada is currently at 3.3%, and the various EU countries range from 2% (Germany) to 26% (Czech Republic)."
2080,"Out of the 27 EU countries, it seems only Germany, Denmark, Greece, and the 3 Baltic States are currently lower than Canada."
2081,"I'm not sure what the total EU average is, as I can't find data presented that way."
2082,"It surely must be much higher than Canada, though?"
2083,"I guess it must be simply that things are getting worse all around the world, so that's even more reason NOT to risk adding imported cases."
2084,Edit: Sorry Luxembourg too!
2085,It's a mixture of a few things.
2086,The leadership hasn't been great.
2087,"Even though they acted pretty quickly during the first wave, it's always been a bit of a hodge-podge of measures."
2088,"They should have come with a concrete plan, taking into account that this thing was not going to go away soon."
2089,The second factor is the people themselves.
2090,"Even if most people tried to abide by the rules at first, they got sick of it during the summer."
2091,"Plenty of people planned large gatherings, secret parties in the woods, etc."
2092,"At the low point the positive test rate was about 0.4%, with about 50 - 70 confirmed cases a day."
2093,The total amount of infectious people in the country was estimated to be around 1000-2000.
2094,So people got more careless again.
2095,"It probably didn't help we had a great summer and start of autumn, people can (mostly) travel freely across Europe and that we're a very densely populated country."
2096,"Currently I need to explain the impact of the false positive rate of Corona PCR tests, especially why (probably) not a false positive rate of 0.008 would apply while the positive rate was 0.01."
2097,have any of them actually been tested?
2098,"at my local testing center you wait in line, and when your car right by the testing tent, they get your personal information, then you pull up and they test you immediately after."
2099,unless you drive a jacked up truck there's no way to give them your information and then leave without being tested
2100,University is supposed to be fun?
2101,Most students are begging to graduate as fast as possible.
2102,"Environmental conditions in indoor spaces are the same year round though, if fomites were a major vector we‚Äôd definitely know"
2103,"This strategy is an insane and painfully flawed misinterpretation of the CDC's ""15 minute close contact"" guideline

&gt;If the students are moved around within that time, their thinking goes, no one will have had ‚Äúclose contact‚Äù and be required to stay home if a classmate tests positive

...

&gt;Infectious disease experts say that moving students around every few minutes is actually more likely to increase transmission of the virus, by exposing more people to an infected student."
2104,"It will also complicate contact tracing efforts, they said."

2187,"If you don't, but you somehow think that more restrictions will end the pandemic sooner, you'd be dead wrong."

2190,"It was around for small pox, which is why it was a disease of children."

2198,Yeah I agree.
2199,I think their are viable discussions to have around some level of activity.
2200,But this should also be based on the expectation that failure (rising case counts) can and will be met with roll backs.
2201,And I also agree that testing and tracing needs to be heavily increased (and mask mandates across the board).
2202,"It seems we did actually get the tests and contact tracing levels up, we just never let the community spread drop low enough for our current capacity to be adequate."

2383,"Well said man, well said."

2551,So yeah herd immunity isn‚Äôt going to work
2552,"Sounds like organizing an orgy, lol."

2559,"Because they look just like a regular restaurant or bar, where they *don't* do stuff like that."
2560,"The bar scene where I am is the hot spot, and the servers have started to hear from employers that they shouldn't get tested because they don't want their restaurant shut down due to positive tests."
2561,"Your call 

If you want to wear gloves, sanitize all surfaces go ahead."
2562,I wash my hands on entering or leaving places and wear a mask and avoid large events
2563,&gt;How could someone writing an article that includes numbers for comparison not know about accounting for population?
2564,"Believe me, the author knows."
2565,"No, the flu deaths are for all ages, for a full year."
2566,"So Covid19 is more deadly to people under 65, than the flu is to everyone 0-125 at least 7 out of the past 10 years."
2567,And closing in on the 8th.
2568,"To date, no one has used thyroid cancer as an excuse to exert control and decimate the economy."
2569,What makes you so sure?
2570,Trump says vaccine is coming very soon
2571,But my aunt's friend who dropped out of kindergarten and plays word games on her phone posted a video on line of a mask strapped to a shower head when it was turned on.
2572,"They had to shut the shower curtain quickly, before the water soaked the bathroom and  their video equipment."

2575,"One issue though is that while you may find the average person in the middle of their spreading \*time\*, the spreading itself is unevenly distributed, with most of it occuring in the beginning of the infection."
2576,"Later on, symptoms worsen and people isolate."
2577,Many many fewer.
2578,The median age of death for covid is over 80.
2579,Almost no one lived to that age 100 years ago.
2580,My husband is a teacher in Texas.
2581,They cannot make students wear masks.
2582,"If a student will not wear a mask, it is not a disciplinary issue."
2583,The maskless student cannot be sent to the admin or kept from class.
2584,The district says teachers and staff  who test positive for Covid can return to campus after 3 days.
2585,"If they will be absent longer than 3 days for Covid, they need a hospital note."
2586,"National mask mandate under what constitutional authority, just curious?"
2587,I wonder if the majority of these ended up going one of two ways.
2588,1.
2589,First infection mild or asymptomatic: person didn‚Äôt mount a strong immune response and so reinfection could range anywhere from mild to severe depending on viral dose.
2590,2.
2591,First infection was moderate to severe: person had a strong immune response with memory t-cells and antibodies.
2592,Second infection was asymptomatic to mild.
2593,Both of those would make sense.
2594,Anything that doesn‚Äôt fall between those 2 scenarios would hopefully be rare.
2595,"Since the mRNA vaccine candidates evoke a strong immune response with memory cells, a viable vaccine shouldn‚Äôt have reinfection issues."
2596,Not gonna lie.
2597,Watched the clip just to see Prime Minister McHottie.
2598,You keep moving the goal posts.
2599,Why are you insisting on doubling down on this?
2600,It is literally impossible to prove the non existence of something.
2601,"Sure, there may be a chance that there could be some frozen in some permafrost somewhere, but it is functionally extinct."
2602,"not true, there are many bodies frozen in the north (siberia for example) from previous points in history with smallpox."
2603,"there has already been bodies found with characteristics of smallpox sores, climate change means these will be increasingly surfacing as the ice melts."
2604,many more diseases we potentially don't know about too.
2605,I am all for people getting paid for the risk.
2606,$4.8k/week or $250k/year seems kinda high though.
2607,This implies healthcare corporations will put the wellbeing of their lowest level employees above their profits.
2608,Healthcare here in the United States is first and foremost a business.
2609,"When there are major costs to be had, corners will be cut and they will never come from the bottom line."
2610,Our *jobs* are what is critical.
2611,"We, the people who work those jobs, are not."
2612,"I, the person writing this, am nothing more than a human commodity."
2613,"The deaths of my fellow front line healthcare workers is simply collateral damage in a fight to ""keep the economy open,"" that's resulted from grossly incompetent leadership that has simply given up trying to respond to this virus."
2614,"The nurses, the doctors, the x-ray technicians, the janitors, the people at the front desk, the people most abused by the very patients we are supposed to protect and serve, are as disposable as the surgical masks and gloves we wear."
2615,"In much more politically correct terms, we are ""heroes."""
2616,"&gt;Planes have excellent air ventilation and filtration systems, which remove coronavirus particles from the air about every six minutes, the U.S. Transportation Command reported Thursday."
2617,"&gt;  
&gt;""So the only opportunity to breathe the virus in comes from the air that passes by you before it goes through that ventilation system,"" says engineer Linsey Marr at Virginia Tech."
2618,"**""And so that's only going to happen if you're sitting close to the person who's sick."
2619,"""**

What this really means is that you avoid illness if you maintain social distancing and you may not if you don't."
2620,"Which doesn't make flying particularly safe, but about as risky as any other extended gathering of people that is located indoors in a place with good ventilation."
2621,And indoor gatherings are not a particularly good idea.

2699,It's gotta be unfortunate to live that close to beansnappers lol
2700,You're hung up on me arguing that deaths is a bad measurement *in general*.
2701,It isn't.
2702,It's perfectly fine to say that one country had more deaths than another.
2703,It's just too simplistic to use *only* deaths to evaluate the different measures taken.
2704,Suppose that there are two countries A and B.
2705,Very early in the pandemic both countries enact a lockdown and both lockdowns are *identical*.
2706,"Three months into the lockdown you examine the statistics and see the following:

Country A had 0 deaths per million."
2707,Country B had 100 deaths per million.
2708,Country A looks a lot better until you learn that they had no infected people in the first place.
2709,This proves my point: Two countries did the *exact same thing* but their outcome (number of dead people) was different.
2710,"You might argue that country B should have enacted a lockdown earlier and that they thus would have been better off in the end, and that would be true, but it would also prove my point."
2711,"After all, they did *exactly* the same thing."
2712,Just not at the same time.
2713,So timing factors into it as well.
2714,"Other things that likely matter: Population density, how often people use public transport, how common it is for people to be in close physical contact, how common it is for people to go to public places etc."

2874,Lol I hope you all yourself why you're so strongly against this.
2875,Weird take.
2876,I don't think a one sentence comment can get worse.
2877,"First, you get caught in hypocrisy."
2878,Your side always said *lockdowns don't work*.
2879,Now even Tegnell wants lockdowns.
2880,"Second, you get so flustered you have to break the subreddits rules against incivility, so you *double down* on your denialism instead of admitting you and Tegnell have been *making shit up* since February."

2882,Don't be offensive on the internet!
2883,"We can have a reasonable, civil discussion about whether on balance schools should be open or closed during a pandemic."
2884,"Personally I think we should have put our efforts into making remote learning better, into making it accessible for disadvantaged communities, and supporting childcare for all those who confuse education with daycare."
2885,What we ended up with given the push to reopen schools is worse than either alternative - the massive disruption of opening then closing then opening then closing again.
2886,That disruption may be of greater impact than COVID-19.

2888,Thanks.

2891,"&gt;The state is seeing record case numbers, adding to evidence that the virus is poised to thrive as the weather grows colder."
2892,The ranking isnt about healthcare spending.
2893,Its about which country provides the best quality of life and keeps their elderly alive.
2894,I suggest you take a look at the report.
2895,Basically im taking youre conspiracy theory about elderly being killed in Sweden and raising with actual facts from the UN.
2896,No respect for humanity.
2897,"You see, when you dont read the article you make yourself look like a fool in the comments."
2898,Doubling down only makes it worse.
2899,Maybe the one bad doctor can drink a beer with that one bad cop
2900,Crazy that they care more than the hospitals do!
2901,"I know nurses who were told to still come into work with a positive test, and servers for corporate chains who were forced to stay home and quarantine for 2 weeks!!"
2902,!
2903,It's like some people think they can negotiate with the virus somehow
2904,Yeah because the media wanking over NZ and ragging on the USA is in vogue right now.
2905,"Dear God, don't even get me started."
2906,"I had a reddit discussion with someone yesterday who simply couldn't grasp why it's better to have one person doing groceries for four people, than those four people each going to the store individually."
2907,This isn't rocket science!
2908,Have there been any reports of unhealthy people surviving or having a mild-moderate illness?
2909,"Like smokers, addicts, anemics, etc."
2910,Smoky AF in BC awhile back not sure about now.
2911,"The ~70% (‚âà 1-1/3.x) is derived from the observed R0 number, i.e."
2912,"reproductive number observed when nobody had yet had it, and that will have incorporated all those things except that perhaps the super-spreader effect is non-linear."
2913,But I'd like to see some actual math or modelling of super-spreading with various levels of immunity before relying on that.
2914,It's not obvious to me (and my dusty old math degree) what the interaction between those are.
2915,"But sure, I'm not picking 70% as my hill to die on."
2916,It just seems the best estimate we've got at the moment and then we'll see as more data comes in.
2917,"But suppose by the time the vaccine is rolled out, 10% have been exposed, of the other 90% we get 90% taking the vaccine, then we could make do with a 75% effective vaccine for 10%+90%*90%*75% ‚âà 70% immunity and we _just_ make it over the threshold."

2927,"Again, healthcare spending has nothing to do with the way elderly patients were treated during Covid."
2928,Not sure why you keep confusing the two.
2929,Does pneumonia take a very long time to recover from anyway?
2930,That could be causing your breathlessness.

2948,Malaria?
2949,TB?
2950,"Regular influenza- summing up 600,000 per year over several centuries is gonna be a huge number."
2951,Such obvious nonsense.
2952,Even more sickening is most of you probably find this exciting.
2953,They may ‚Äúcare‚Äù about them but the reality is when it came time to make a decision they treated elderly people as if they were disposable.
2954,Traffic deaths actually increased during lockdowns.
2955,Overdoses and suicides also increased.
2956,I take exception to that.
2957,These are NOT educators.
2958,These are ADMINISTRATORS.
2959,Huge difference.
2960,As a cat owner this would kill me inside if that happened.

2974,I am dying to see season 2 XD
2975,The increase in testing in Alberta is clearly going to bring the amount of positive cases up.
2976,There is no vaccine.
2977,The only thing that matters is keeping the hospitals from reaching capacity.
2978,"If they reach capacity, lockdown happens."
2979,No hospital in Canada is anywhere near capacity.
2980,"That might be part of it, but I feel also that Asian governments have stepped up to fight this thing head on, whereas the western governments have blamed, denied and then offered only minimal help at the 11th hour."

2997,My thoughts exactly
2998,"Now imagine how environmentalists have felt the last 20 years, slowly watching the planet be burnt to death..."
2999,70% isn't necessarily required for herd immunity.
3000,Herd immunity isn't a magic number.
3001,"When you consider existing immunity from previous infections or the innate unexplained immunity that some people seem to have, and the fact that this pandemic is primarily super spreader driven, we may not need near 70% of people to get vaccinated to achieve normalcy."
3002,People on average live in larger spaces.
3003,&gt; we're already at the highest amount of concurrently infected that we've ever had.
3004,We're also seeing record high number of infections per day.
3005,"So yes, objectively speaking, the situation where I live is worse and is worsening."
3006,"Please, enlighten me where I am spreading misinformation."
3007,The important distinction to make is between the current testing rate and the testing rate at the peak of infections in the spring.
3008,You're at the highest amount of concurrently infected AND tested positive.
3009,"But due to low testing numbers back in spring (as the article I linked points out), actual numbers of infected was far higher back then."
3010,"Of course due to exponential growth we may be heading towards that level of infections again, but it is not the case yet."
3011,Doesn't that prove my point?
3012,American state funded education are trash so you gotta brag about going into private unis.
3013,Oh and funny thing is going to shitty schools like Pomona doesn't require you to buy your way in lol
3014,"Add ""we're all in this together"" to the list of ways not to broadcast information about the virus."

I said the same thing about the 2016 election."
3023,I‚Äôm pretty sure the Black Death killed more people per capita than the Spanish flu.
3024,The level of contact tracing China does is not feasible in the West due to privacy issues.
3025,"I personally support better contact tracing, but a lot of people who happily provide all their privacy and movement information to corporations like Google also say that they would rather risk death than grant the governments access to the same data."
3026,base spread numbers indicate upwards of 1 billion infected;  woth out an over time metric.
3027,10% ICUs rate at that time; so 10% of 1billion for the low end.
3028,Beacause there is this this myth going on that Sweden dont care about the elderly.
3029,Its not true since they are really good at keeping them alive (5th best in the world) and the best in the world (1th place) at giving them quality of life.
3030,"This vaccine currently has a *limited temporary* registration which permits it to be offered to certain high-risk groups under emergency situation rules (as of now, some number of doses is being distributed among healthcare workers, and teachers will be the next group to have access)."
3031,"At the same time phase 3 of the trials is running, the *full registration*, which will permit general public use, will be granted after sufficient amount of data from phase 3 is available (last I've heard - expected around January)."
3032,Also don't forget the matter of manufacturing (production needs to be scaled from research to industrial volumes).
3033,"Current projections put it at 800k doses in November, 1.5mln in December, 3mln in January and 15mln a month in Spring (source in Russian [https://www.interfax.ru/russia/731467](https://www.interfax.ru/russia/731467))

3060,"Not sure what you meant by that then ...

&gt;  The 50% effective thing just isn't being talked about, but it's true

As many experts have reiterated over and over ... eradication is nearly impossible the idea is to reduce transmission, deaths and load on the healthcare ... something even a partially effective vaccine can help with."
3061,Because the official language on reddit.com is english.
3062,"On the flip side, how many would some of the others kill now considering the medical advancement in the last 100 years"
3063,You are getting some stuff wrong.
3064,"For example, reinfection by COVID is thought to be immunity wearing off, NOT due to different strains."
3065,The different strains are not different in ways that matter.
3066,"Also, you said that COVID mutates rapidly, but that's not the case."
3067,"It's somewhere on the order of 1,000 times slower mutation than the flu, for instance."
3068,Coronaviruses don't mutate rapidly because they have a self-correcting mechanism when they copy that something like the flu does not have.
3069,Huh?
3070,Are you implying I'm some kind of bot?
3071,"I'm also in Australia but in a different state, cases spiked here and 700 people mostly in care homes died in 6 weeks or so, so we've been in lockdown now for about 12 or 13 weeks."
3072,"It's easing off now but we had a night time curfew, all hospitality, cinemas, gyms, hairdressers and most retail shut, emergency surgery only, no travel more than 5ks from your home and lots of other restrictions."
3073,"It's been tough but we're coming out the other side now, the second lockdown came one month after we came out of the first so we've only had 4 weeks of semi normal life since March."
3074,"Cabin fever sets in, then people get pissed off and angry, then the bickering about the lockdown ratchets up, and all this while friends are getting sick and old folks are dying."
3075,"So yeah, it doesn't always help when people tell you to stay strong, I hear you."
3076,"But what if the ""first wave"" was only part of the buildup to this wave."

3086,I went into shock trying to read this
3087,You would start to see the virus act differently after a vaccine is rolled out.
3088,The protection a vaccine offers would simulate the effects of those restrictions.
3089,It was also before the concept of people sewing their own cloth masks.
3090,"When medical authorities in those early days talked about mask wearing, they were referring to the hard to get medical ppe desperately needed by healthcare workers."
3091,"If only homemade cloth masks had been readily available back then, I imagine the messaging would have been a bit different."
3092,Enter all of the #NoNewNormal people...
3093,Imagine digging your heels in and refusing to change in the face of a changing world.
3094,"There have been challenge trials with the common cold coronaviruses, and most people can get reinfected in less than a year."

3144,Random neighbors withholding candy?
3145,You think parents haven't been 24/7 supporting and encouraging their kids while they are home from school and the playgrounds were shutdown?
3146,Kids are resilient.
3147,Alternatives to going to strangers houses and asking for candy will upend their lives far less than furthering the impact of Covid on their community because  their parents didn't want to tell them no.
3148,I once had Christmas tucked inside a funeral week for a family member and the tree was a ficus plant we decorated with paper circles and our presents were wrapped in trash bags.

3166,It is speculated that opening schools since the beginning of September together with weather conditions may be to blame.

3169,Polish healthcare was overloaded even before the pandemic and is now on the verge of collapse.
3170,Testing capacity is almost saturated with positive rate hovering around 12%.

3253,OP here.
3254,I have a hard time finding GA updates.
3255,AJC has a live updates page (iirc) that can‚Äôt be linked here.
3256,Would take other news source suggestions.
3257,That‚Äôs kinda what their starting to determine.
3258,But honestly who knows anymore.
3259,"You can go to the nature, but only in a group of two."
3260,"My local hospital has never sent patients out unless they were children in critical state, then they were sent to a children's hospital in the region."
3261,"Now, if you're not covid, you're being sent to other places."
3262,Anything at all.
3263,"They announced covid cases will start being sent somewhere else, because they're at over 100% room capacity and 98% bed capacity."
3264,Figure that out.
3265,"That means there are beds in the halls, waiting rooms, and any other available space."
3266,So.
3267,Your theory?
3268,Human to mink back to human is already a fact.
3269,Boo fucking hoo 25 cases?!!
3270,!
3271,It‚Äôs not wise to use just that one factor as a determinant of how you respond to COVID honestly.
3272,Too many other factors can influence your recovery.
3273,"Yes, you are."
3274,"It may never leave your body and you may wind up with permanent lung, heart and brain inflammation"
3275,The lame-duck session will be about shredding documents and pardoning criminals.
3276,It is likely that the sabotage of the Coronavirus response ceases aftre the elections.
3277,Trump will have nothing to gain from his efforts to increase the coronavirus infection.
3278,Hopefully the rats he introduced in every agency to manipulate are driven out during the transition.
3279,I don't really know.
3280,I can't imagine a Trump transition.
3281,He will destroy everything.
3282,They're probably scared of all of the Antifas coming and stealing their rights!!!
3283,/s
3284,The point was an election.
3285,They didn't want to do it before it.
3286,It made it from human to mink (and mutated) back again to humans.
3287,It s in over 50 species so far found.
3288,Then the covid ADE thing what is new and i can t see the Impact on vaccines.
3289,Then MIS-A (and MIS-C).
3290,We are fucked hard.
3291,A tad differently indeed.
3292,The way it has disrupted the supply chain confuses me.
3293,I understand that all the rubbing alcohol is being turned into hand sanitizer and the company that makes febreze is probably busy making something else right now covid related but my wife used to buy the frozen breaded shrimp every week and for the last 5 months it's almost always been out of stock.
3294,I have no idea why that would be true.
3295,Its really impossible to contain with how viral it is.
3296,"So what is the strategy, wait until there's a vaccine?"
3297,"With the Spanish Flu, it was a major cause of death."

3304,"With COVID, just about everything is."
3305,"But it's not a super-common one, and unlike, say, the Spanish Flu, diarrhea is not killing a lot of people from COVID."
3306,Depends where you are.
3307,"We've a tiered system, only a few northern English areas are locked down to the point of closure."
3308,"Scotland has gone harder, Wales and Northern Ireland are firebreaking."
3309,"But in most of England (particularly the South), pubs and restaurants are open with slightly shorter hours."
3310,Worth saying we're not being hit uniformly.
3311,"London took the brunt the first time, and by the time it spread to the North, it was summer and we were coming out of lockdown, hence now the hotspot are where it was just taking hold in May/June."
3312,They're trying a regional approach to 'save the economy'.
3313,That would be be a bummer.
3314,"The perfect storm, really:

1."
3315,"Colder temps, weaker immune system

2."
3316,"People spending more time indoors/huddled together

3. less sunlight, less Vitamin D

4."
3317,2nd/3rd wave (yeah it know the 1st wave wasn't entirely gone) = people don't care anymore.
3318,Its bad for the economy to close too soon and they prepared for 2nd wave to handle more infected at the same time
3319,"All those numbers are post estimates for the outbreak, while covid currently has just a faulty reporting system."
3320,Estimates already say 2-3 times more than reported.
3321,"When this shitshow is over, I'm sure it will rank much higher."
3322,Possibly very sociable people.
3323,"Notice how a lot of politicians etc got infected early on, because of the vast number of social contacts they have."
3324,It works the same way for social butterflies.
3325,"Nothing Tegnell has done so far makes new think he is a ""good scientist."""
3326,I would not be surprised if this virus gets ‚Äúsilently‚Äù worse and worse and it kills the whole human population in perhaps even a span of 100 years.
3327,I'm not surprised.
3328,We live on an island that just allowed tourists to skip a 14 day quarantine if they test negative for the virus.
3329,"Majority of these tourists are not wearing masks or following guidelines, and a lot of the locals are right behind them."
3330,"Yet when we get sent back to lockdown, everyone complains and doesn't understand why."
3331,ü§¶üèæ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
3332,"Generally agree with you but if you look at Portugal, they had a spike in excess deaths in August with no notable covid breakout so maybe there was some weird other cause explaining some of it in Iberia?"
3333,"And of the 11,000 second wave excess deaths how many have actually been recorded covid deaths?"
3334,Spain has been around 800 deaths/week for awhile now so I‚Äôm guessing at least a few thousand.
3335,Still that does leave a decent gap.
3336,Interesting
3337,China must pay.
3338,"I think six months was the expectation for duration of immunity back in the feb-mar 2020 timeframe, back when I was reading through tsunami of data and professional commentary."
3339,"If you can substantiate your claim that other factors than health policy are more significant in the differences in pandemic performance, more power to you."
3340,"To me, cause and effect are relatively clear in these cases."
3341,"Governments that pursued psuedo-herd immunity approaches, or essentially no approach at all, the U.S., the U.K., Sweden, Brazil, etc., have massively worse death rates than countries that took aggressive, science-based actions, such as Australia, Vietnam, South Korea, Thailand, Slovakia, Taiwan, etc."
3342,"Worst episode of American top 40 ever, especially when you consider Cove it is still climbing the charts."
3343,That's less comforting than a hot coffee to the pants.
3344,One dumb belief I've heard in regards to the number of deaths is that hospitals are falsely attributing deaths to covid19 when the patients with it would of died anyway (cancer patients for example).
3345,Also there's the conspiracy theory that hospitals misrepresent any unrelated deaths as from the virus to get more funding.
3346,No Trumper I've talked to has cared that he contracted the virus.
3347,They buy the narrative put out by him and others that the symptoms are mild for everyone and not to be scared of.
3348,It'll get worse everywhere in no time
3349,&gt;Whaaaaat there will be Americans partying for Halloween this year?
3350,But but but‚Ä¶ What?
3351,many never stopped.

3353,College kids are having parties.
3354,College kids are babysitting for folks knowing they were exposed to covid.
3355,"I get to hear a lot of ""fun"" stories as I have a relative who has to take down every case/death of covid in about 5% of our state (NJ)."
3356,Some days it has taken them over 12 hours just to get through it.
3357,"They were going to have someone assist them, but didn't want others to have to cope with it."
3358,They have broken down crying in the middle of the process several times.
3359,"They have had to update this list every single day since the middle of March, and still are to this day."
3360,"I see, thanks for the explanation."
3361,üôèüèº
3362,Not a fair generalization.
3363,France Germany Belgium Sweden Denmark and others have zero gap between excess deaths and Covid deaths.
3364,"Out of curiosity I searched the posts from OP (who has an admirably consistant post format) where he published the ""since Friday"" stats."
3365,Here are the weekend stats for the past 8 weeks.
3366,"+421

+573

+840

+1199

+1543

+1862

+2203

+3180

The active cases are absolutely not stable."
3367,Sweden is experiencing a second wave just as the rest of Europe is.
3368,Hopefully the deaths will be better this time for everyone but its not reasonable to call this stable I think.
3369,fuck cnbc iirc he was saying flying has no risk
3370,"Nah, I am in shape: When that happened I had quite literally every symptom of Covid, I looked like I was dying in the face."

3375,"The 50% effective thing just isn't being talked about, but it's true."
3376,"Flu vaccines (on a good year) hit 65%, Malaria is around 30%."
3377,They're relying on what will essentially herd immunity by another name.
3378,"And that will only work if you have widespread vaccination, and there isn't the infrastructure there to just do that overnight."
3379,"Frozen storage, chilled transport, enough equipment."

3388,A good scientist will almost never use certain terms.
3389,They use words like ‚Äúmaybe‚Äù or ‚Äúpossibly‚Äù
3390,Herd immunity is different to what you think it is.
3391,"In your idea of the concept, essentially the us is also going for herd immunity."
3392,"But actually, the high compliance and self responsibility of people in Sweden (and it‚Äôs polar opposite New Zealand) plus restrictions that have been in place most of the way through this pandemic have arguably kept Sweden‚Äôs numbers low."
3393,Assuming everyone on the ship gets infected immediately instead of the infection spreading during the voyage and there still being contagious people on board when the ship arrives.
3394,"wait a sec, the pResident said that people were sick of the pandemic and it was basically over."

3396,^^^^/s
3397,Enjoying that most of my friends are now spread around the country and we mostly just hung out online to start.
3398,Managed to have one big party in january before all of this started happening.
3399,Pretty sure that's when people trick you
3400,you are just guessing.
3401,"take a look at swedish numbers - quite a lot of people from 70+ treated in hospitals, and quite a lot of them in icu."
3402,it really doesn't help to come online and state what you think as facts.
3403,i did not do that - i stated what could happen and why it's wrong.
3404,"anyway, i also checked the count in sweden, just to prove you are just talking without checking stuff:

[https://www.icuregswe.org/en/data--results/covid-19-in-swedish-intensive-care/](https://www.icuregswe.org/en/data--results/covid-19-in-swedish-intensive-care/)

do note that these ""old groups"" have been in lockdown (hence this whole post) and take this into account when checking the numbers, as they are seriously deflated due to the facts and story behind the arcitle we're commenting about."
3405,"Because people who are getting sick twice and tested positive twice aren't being considered ""reinfections"" without sequencing because it hasn't been formally established yet whether the original infection is re-emerging or if the person is truly being reinfected."
3406,They originally thought it was re-emergence by the sequencing and confirmed re-infections is quickly proving that false.
3407,I think soon we won't require the sequencing proof anymore which will cause reinfection numbers to skyrocket once you start including all the people who got sick twice.
3408,The pandemic unemployment payment is ‚Ç¨350 per week and is scheduled to be in place until next April.
3409,Shit thats bad
3410,Thats near what sweden had at its peak.
3411,"And if the swedish experience is anything to go by, most deaths happen after the peak."
3412,Wish you could be watched my uncle did slowly over a video link then
3413,Does natural immunity (T cell or antibody) develops on other thing than spike protein?
3414,And is thus less effective ?

3462,I've seen a lot of published research lately on various observations on the various functions the virus is altering that they impact their immune response.
3463,"And it's not that this virus is unique in its ability to alter the immune response in a way that enhances its survival, it's unique in that it's changing our immune response so much that it's completely dysfunctional."
3464,"https://www.cell.com/cell/fulltext/S0092-8674(20)31310-6

My favorite example for this at the moment."
3465,"This is outlining the underlying mechanisms for how the virus is preventing the secretion of type 1 interferons, which would certainly explain how the virus derails the immune response from the very start of the infection."
3466,"this, Pfizer and J+J are the ones that western governments ordered a shitload of preemptively."
3467,makes sense that an English speaking website would be more focused on the ones they're probably going to get
3468,"There are increased risks obviously, but it‚Äôs more sustainable long-term, I think."
3469,"It worked well for us and we were able to have our kids play together, etc."
3470,"Say for example what we are predicting here comes true, and come end of this month China announces that one of their vaccine candidate has passed phase 3 trial and thus becomes the first and only COVID-19 vaccine at that time."
3471,Whoever get their hands on this vaccine will see their economy recover ahead of all the other countries who can't get access to it.
3472,This suddenly puts impetus on countries to make deals with China to try to get on China's good side so they can be earlier in the queue for the vaccine.
3473,In the mean time US will sure as hell try to convince countries not to break rank and wait for US vaccine which will shortly become available also.
3474,"This would be similar to the scramble for masks at the start of the year, only much more intense this time around."

3645,Another thing to keep in mind is that hospital / ICU beds are normally between 60-80% occupied by other non-COVID medical situations (at least that was the norm prior to the pandemic).
3646,"So whatever is left is referred to as ""spare-capacity""."
3647,"So even though we have 122k ICU beds, only 40k may be available on any given day."

3969,You know those much more deadlier diseases.
3970,"And the numbers seems to indicate that we are having fewer cancer, heart attack, diabetes, strokes, heart disease deaths than normal."
3971,I wonder what would account for such a drastic improvement in every other much more deadly category.
3972,This is exactly why there *needs* to be a **federal** law mandating masks **right fucking now**.
3973,"In many ways this doesn‚Äôt go far enough however, because often even people who wear masks do so wrongly."
3974,By no fault of their own.
3975,It just happens.
3976,For this reason there should be a task force of specialists who can monitor that these masks are being worn correctly.
3977,They can spread out into the communities and do this work.
3978,"As part of that, people who have willfully put their fellow citizens in danger need to be identified."
3979,This obviously includes anybody who voted for Trump.
3980,These people should have a special insignia on their masks so they can be identified by authorities for the sake of the public good.
3981,Their children should perhaps have a slightly less conspicuous symbol on their masks ‚Äî something to identify the very real risk they are in as a result of being raised by such enemies of society and of science.
3982,"As part of a new nationwide emphasis on public health, citizens should be encouraged to identify people who are ‚Äúenemies‚Äù of this progress."
3983,"Once identified, these individuals should be given a chance to repent and change their ways."
3984,"But this progress will of course need to be monitored by the government, so they should have a third type of insignia on their masks, to ease identification."
3985,"To facilitate compliance with the new public health measures, a new agency of the government should be created."
3986,The task force I mentioned above can easily be adopted to this work.
3987,These individuals will be employed by the federal government but not identified as such.
3988,This is to help gain a measure of trust from the population.
3989,"Their jobs will be to keep files on individuals within their purview, and update these files regularly to track progress."
3990,"Obviously people who willingly violate the new mask law will have to be separated from society ‚Äî for the good of society, as well as for their own good."
3991,This will be dealt with humanely and fairly.
3992,Not at all like Nazis.
3993,These individuals will simply be separated from their families and society and moved to a safe place for a time being.
3994,All perfectly humane and fair.
3995,These safe places will seek to educate them to the evil of their ways and the harm they are doing to the world.
3996,Once re-educated they can be returned to society.
3997,Of course repeat offenders will have to be dealt with a little more harshly.
3998,But this will be for their own benefit.
3999,"Eventually individuals who have proven to be a menace to society and a danger to the security of the state, will have to be permanently removed."
4000,"This too will be done humanely, but the key is that it will be done for the good of the collective whole."
4001,Because in such a system there will really be no space for individualism.
4002,This selfish attitude is exactly what got us into such trouble in the first place.
4003,"So selfish activity will have to be controlled in all aspects of society, especially the economic realm."
4004,Individuals will not be allowed to hoard cash.
4005,"A progressive tax policy will of course help this to be redistributed, to aid the less fortunate."
4006,"With cash hoarding outlawed, banks will not have any reason to exist."
4007,So they can probably be done away with first.
4008,People who run these banks will have to be identified as enemies of the state and placed in camps until they see the error of their ways and can be returned to society.
4009,"But of course they will not be allowed to enter in an advantageous position, but somewhere near the base, where they will be reduced to doing manual tasks that help the greater good."
4010,Needless to say they will also have a special insignia on their masks that identifies them as a part of this dangerous class of individuals.
4011,Business owners of all stripes will have to receive the same treatment as the managers of banks.
4012,Of course they will be understanding and will welcome an opportunity to make amends to society.
4013,"However those that do not will, for their own protection, have to be removed from society."
4014,There are other measures that will have to be taken vis-a-vis the bourgeoisie who have brought so much pain unto the country.
4015,But that can be tackled later.
4016,**The important thing is that it should 100% be against the fucking law to leave your house without wearing a mask.
4017,"**

Frankly they should require wearing them even when you are home and even when you‚Äôre alone."
4018,But for now it should simply be strictly outlawed in public.
4019,Anybody caught flaunting this very important rule will have to be dealt with very harshly.
4020,Penalties are not enough.
4021,"Imprisonment, of an indefinite period (at least a year, and up to five or even ten years) for first time offenders."
4022,"No exceptions, no appeals."
4023,Second-time offenders are sent to top secret camps permanently.
4024,These camps will be for degenerates and other repeat violators of these laws.
4025,For security reasons they will have to be off limits to all but a small group of security professionals with special clearance.
4026,Red Cross and other international organizations will not be allowed anywhere near their premises.
4027,This to make sure such harmful individuals are kept out of sight and out of mind.
4028,"It is only fair, correct, and proper that such measures are taken against people who willfully go out in public without masks."
4029,Thankfully only a few deny it happens at all...

4071,Covid-19 has a much lower rate of mutagenicity.
4072,"That's not saying it can't mutate, but that it has a much less likely chance of mutating."
4073,"A vaccine can be effective against it (or several, all targeting different aspects of the virus like the spike protein or the coating itself)."
4074,A multi-targeted approach towards vaccination can eliminate it completely if it doesn't mutate in the target spots.
4075,"We eliminated other viruses in the past, we can eliminate this one too."
4076,It's nowhere near as bad as Cuomo's New York State or Murphy's New Jersey.

4127,"I'm a mechanical engineer, so not a subject matter expert."
4128,But I did A LOT of research before the pandemic got to the US.

4649,"&gt; As the COVID-19 pandemic progressed across the world, governments, international agencies, policymakers, and public health officials began recommending widespread use of nonmedical cloth masks to reduce the transmission of SARS-CoV-2."
4650,The authors of this article suggest that there is convincing evidence to support this recommendation.
4651,"Well, if you‚Äôre a business that had essential workers then you didn‚Äôt shut down obviously...and we‚Äôre aware of the unlivable wages most of those companies offer, also we know already that the wage gap has been increasing over the last 35-40 years."
4652,And many of those essential businesses absolutely scraped cash this year.
4653,"But this isn‚Äôt some narrative that businesses are making any specific kind of money, it‚Äôs a narrative about providing fair conditions, livable wages, value, etc."

4668,The shear number of inhabitants?
4669,"That was bad word choice on my part, so I‚Äôll back up a bit to explain what I mean."
4670,Some people on this sub talk about post-vaccine outbreaks and restrictions as if a vaccine won‚Äôt disrupt the chain of transmission hardly at all.
4671,"I think local restrictions will probably still be needed in the short term after the rollout of a vaccine, but the vaccine should disrupt the virus‚Äôs ability to transmit itself enough that full lockdowns won‚Äôt be necessary."
4672,Get the Russian one!
4673,"For sure, it‚Äôll take some time."
4674,"I do suspect that once vaccinations roll out to the elderly, infirm, front-line/healthcare workers, etc."

4679,Anti  bodies aren't the whole story.
4680,"According to research they represent at  most 15% of people that are ""immune""."
4681,Another problem is timing.
4682,You  don't get the same result when testing a person that just went trough  the covid19 disease and testing this same person half year later.
4683,AB are  mostly gone by then.
4684,"Other factors as cross immunity from other corona  viruses, T-cell immunity, B-cells play a giant role."

4692,Stop being *silly* (that nicer for you mods?
4693,"), and read the actual articles that you post."
4694,Nitpick: the April numbers were likely far higher but there was just a lack of tests available at the time.
4695,"So the ""house on fire"" time then was likely more like the ~65K we saw over the summer."
4696,"However, back in April the number of deaths was also a lot higher."
4697,It peaked around 2200/day compared to 1100/day over the summer and roughly 750/day right now.
4698,"So it wasn't *just* getting used to bigger numbers, but the numbers of deaths themselves have dropped."

5053,"The early fall was optimistic and more like desperate optimistism, this time several vaccine are already on trial and on phase 3 so seeing them in mid 2021 doesn't seems that unlikely while vaccines in fall was a sweet dream"
5054,Saying vitamin d will increase your odds is not calling it a ‚Äúmiracle pill.‚Äù
5055,"Yes, in Africa flu is so far way deadlier than covid - just check Ethiopia stats for example (1350 covid deaths so far, while flu killed 66k people in 2018, accounting for more than 10% of deaths)."
5056,"Just before I get downvoted into oblivion, in USA or Europe covid is more dangerous as we have older populations and we can handle flu better than African countries (due to vaccines and better health care in general)"
5057,"If practical results from on the field sniffing dogs in other industries are any proof, it's not ""a few false positives""."
5058,It's 80% false positives.
5059,See my other comment.
5060,I‚Äôm trying to decide if it‚Äôs worth paying 160 dollars to find out my levels when I‚Äôve been supplementing for a couple of months.
5061,"Back in the day I was chronically low and needed prescription 10,000 micrograms for a while."

5182,I wonder if that would be a more ethical alternative than placebos.

5262,And they said that's the total of infection could be 5x higher than this.
5263,100%.
5264,Vaccination is 100% that point.
5265,"If 70% of people get the shot, it's 50% effective, that means 35% of the population is immune, 35% between partially immune and not immune, and 30% still able to get the virus because they're morons that didn't get vaccinated."
5266,"With 35-70% of the population protected from the virus, that will likely slow the spread enough to ""flatten the curve"" for remaining infections."

5313,Literally a coin toss going the other way and that person would've almost certainly still been alive.
5314,I wonder at what point it becomes unethical to still be giving placebos.
5315,"We know the vaccine works, we're just looking for unlikely complications."
5316,Fuck yeah!
5317,"Would ""sheeple"" have some sort of advantage over this virus due to having a split genetic makeup?"
5318,I need to look up how to become one.
5319,"No, the actual discussion on this post has turned into comments of ‚Äúwell, I‚Äôd have no problem if masks were just mandated forever‚Äù!"
5320,"So until those comments go away, I‚Äôll continue with my sort of bullshit"
5321,‚ÄúThis solution doesn‚Äôt work!
5322,"Double down and try out more invasive more authoritarian solution and we promise you‚Äôll get better results!‚Äù

No thanks, I‚Äôll stick to researched medical treatments and reasonable social boundary establishment instead of going nuclear."
5323,"Wearing masks and social distancing already helps a ton when people actually follow guidelines, no need for more Big Brother."
5324,A lot of people on twitter don't seem to know what a placebo is either
5325,"I know the front range is extremely crowded (and I'm certainly part of the problem - I wasn't born here), but the crowds and stuff were at least tolerable before covid."
5326,"As long as you didn't go to the well-known spots in the mountains on Saturday at 11 AM, it was mostly fine."
5327,After a mile or two past any trailhead you wouldn't see a single soul all day.

5329,I know it will improve but it's just hard to see the light at the end of the tunnel.
5330,I was reading one in March right after lockdowns earlier and sheesh it was gloomy
5331,Or a bot
5332,Type 1 can be diagnosed at any age.
5333,"Adults are usually labeled as Type 1.5, or LADA (latent autoimmune diabetes in adults)."
5334,Adults in their 20s and 30s being diagnosed is more common than than most people realize.
5335,It's not just a childhood disease.
5336,Had a cat that had a thing for the creme filled donuts (only) from Krispy Kreme.
5337,No other donuts got him as excited as those ones did.

5340,He only cares when the local government of major metros try to push for more progressive and preventative measures.
5341,That's when he steps in.
5342,"Tell that to the dead 28 year old, dumbass"
5343,"With is being the placebo, they have a data point for severe COVID, which is a FDA requirement for authorization."
5344,"We should expect to see more people enrolled in these trials getting severe COVID, as it is a requirement."
5345,Very sad for this young man though and I hope we have enough data for approvals soon.
5346,It happened more or less 2-3 weeks after schools resumed.
5347,And many people expected this exact result.
5348,"Because they still need things like groceries and, you know, jobs."
5349,It‚Äôs not like we can socially distance every second of every day.
5350,That‚Äôs why masks - which I highly doubt the first group would even use - are so highly promoted.
5351,I think you know this and you‚Äôre being deliberately obtuse.
5352,"I practice social distancing as much as I can, but when I work and people are just constantly ignoring the guidelines, and get aggressive when we try to enforce them, it gets a bit tricky."
5353,Oh for fucks sake.. ‚Äúno evidence‚Äù doesn‚Äôt mean it does not work.
5354,It means there is no study on this.

5357,Nah it isn‚Äôt.
5358,Mask mandate and only essential businesses with a national testing program in place with a good effort of contact tracing would have done the trick.

5378,Is there a safe way to gather for Thanksgiving or Christmas?

5380,She wants all family member to get a rapid test 2 days before Thanksgiving and then gather as normal.
5381,Will that work?
5382,What about everyone taking a rapid test and then everyone isolates for 4 days?
5383,8 days?
5384,Then gets together?
5385,Is there any protocol we can implement?
5386,So far I have not heard about effectiveness but do know they are ready to approve a vaccine that works only 50% of the time.
5387,"Other than slowing it down, how does that help people go back to normal?"
5388,"That is, until COVID-22"
5389,"Ok let me help you out, imagine a Republican governor told people not to trust the FDA and CDC on getting a vaccine."
5390,How does this do anything but empower anti-vaxxers?

5396,"You never did a proper lockdown, The USA never locked down."
5397,A half ass shutdown doesn't count.
5398,One of the leading hypotheses is that viral load is correlated with infection severity and people have been taking in less viral loads due to being more careful.
5399,Swabs have shown that people showing up to the hospital now have far smaller viral loads than at the beginning of the pandemic.
5400,Yeah that may be the case FOR YOU.
5401,"That‚Äôs not the same situation for everyone especially those with mental health struggles, so let‚Äôs try to be more understanding of those mindsets."
5402,And having the virus doesn‚Äôt mean instant death sentence.
5403,The stats and science proof that so not sure what you‚Äôre getting at.
5404,It would help if dogs spoke English so they could tell you what they detected.
5405,"If the dog barks, that might be Covid-19 but it might not plus barking might scare some patients."
5406,Indeed... We're not in a good place!
5407,I think at some point we have to shift that risk mitigation to being your responsibility.

5409,"Then make sure those who you are in close contact with are people you know are following self health measures, and continue to wear your N95 personal protection mask when you can‚Äôt keep your distance."
5410,"Grocery stores can keep masking restrictions, because really, you only need to go out to get groceries."
5411,And I will have my wedding.
5412,"Then, you won‚Äôt die :)"
5413,"This is a ridiculous misrepresentation and an intentional straw man of the actual discussion and not a rational, well reasoned counterpoint made in good faith."
5414,"To be frank, I'm growing very tired of this sort of bullshit."

5431,"People are blowing this way out of proportion, as if he‚Äôs calling for a two year stay at home order."
5432,"Well, that sucks."
5433,"Have you seen those plastic, shield-like masks that don't touch your face?"
5434,Maybe you can try one of those.
5435,"And yes, I didn't mean we should wear masks all the time, but we should encourage people to wear them when they're sick."
5436,We didn't give it a second thought before but we could actually lower flu and cold infections too.

5444,"I didn't say it was permanent, wouldn't be a surprise if it took another year until countries welcome the US again without any restrictions."
5445,The flu vaccines cover the strains estimated to be the most common for the year.
5446,That's why some years it is worse than others.
5447,"As long as you weren't exposed to the strain you were vaccinated against before receiving the vaccine, you will not get that strain(s) of the flu."
5448,"I cannot say for sure, but it probably helps with antibodies if the strain wasn't covered."
5449,"Ha, so not quite the same, but I have a reactive dog who loses her mind whenever anyone walks past the house."

5467,You're also the guy who says we won't ever be returning to normal.
5468,"If you're gonna be a troll, at least be consistent."
5469,It probably took the researchers about 5 minutes to unblind that one participant.
5470,"Maybe not, but do you think the death count is proportional to that 800m potential cases?"
5471,Where did you get your currently estimated average from?
5472,I just took the 1.1m death toll world wide and divided that into the potential 800m people hypothesis released a month ago.
5473,"I'm not saying the virus is a hoax, or that masks don't work."
5474,Im taking the information provided by the WHO and justifying my lack of fear with those numbers.

5483,"Italy, Germany, Spain, and other EU countries instituted a complete lockdown for about 2 months and then they opened back up."
5484,They came out psychologically fine.
5485,"Keep in mind, the sooner we control the virus, the sooner we can end lockdowns (and maybe even mask mandates)."
5486,"If you look on graphs, rate of infection was going down during the US lockdown back in April and May...then people started crying murder, opened up prematurely, and here we are."
5487,We all die eventually...but these virus related deaths are preventable.
5488,So again...how are lockdowns ineffective?

5490,i have conflicting Infos (think i read dogs with positive test but i m not sure) but one research shown dogs are probably not a problem.
5491,"During the investigation at the mink farms, cats and dogs from the infected farm locations were tested for infections with the coronavirus."
5492,"Only the first six farms showed infections in cats based on virus detection or detection of antibodies against COVID-19, which means that the cats have been infected."
5493,"At least eleven dogs have been tested for COVID-19 contamination, but no COVID-19 contamination was found in any of these dogs."
5494,Dogs can therefore be excluded as carriers of the virus.

5584,"You can pray at home in the closet, like the bible says."
5585,"Yep, and in Texas we actually saw our low point in cases as the temps finally started coming down in September."
5586,Here people tend to congregate inside during peak summer months because outside it regularly gets to 100F+.
5587,"Now with temps in the 70s and 80s, more people are opting to dine and do stuff outdoors again."
5588,"So in a way, it's almost the opposite of the situation in states up North."

5633,*Your* mask is meant to protect me.
5634,"So if I‚Äôm working at a gas station, and Jethro and his family come in maskless and acting like fools, and little Boogerhands touches all the Payday bars and I can‚Äôt see him because I‚Äôm cleaning up the mess that Cletus made because Lurleen obviously sucks as a parent, I can *still* get sick, even if I‚Äôm wearing a mask and social distancing."
5635,Why is this so hard to comprehend?
5636,I swear you‚Äôre being contrarian on purpose.
5637,Ageism?
5638,Horsecrap.
5639,Boomers are the ones always talking shit about the younger generations.
5640,When tables turn all of a sudden it‚Äôs ‚Äúageism‚Äù.
5641,F that noise.
5642,Thats very true.
5643,I‚Äôm just a nervous nelly about it as we all have a lot riding on it.
5644,They will be even more shocked when they learn Poland is in Central Europe.
5645,"No vaccine is 100% effective,  not sure why this is news."
5646,I read somewhere that half the intubated covid patients in ICU were on dialysis machines because covid had fucked their kidneys.
5647,It pretty much attacks all your main organs.
5648,"Liver, kidneys, brain etc."
5649,OSHA is a joke
5650,His name is Doctor?
5651,I think my collie mix could figure it out in about a day.
5652,Depends on how much it smells.
5653,"When it's all about releasing the scoop first in today's day and age, there's no time to wait for the facts..."
5654,He certainly upped his visualization game
5655,Thanks I put myself in this mess trying to be a smart ass and I can't get out
5656,Reopening travel within the Schengen zone is exactly what got Europe into trouble in the first place.
5657,Travel should have been test based
5658,"I'm not sure if you're a journalist yourself but there will certainly be journalists in your region who are doing exactly what you're asking: questioning the ""official"" numbers and seeking the truth from other data sources."
5659,Some govts can make life very hard for these professional fact checkers and journalists who are scrutinizing govt data but I would seek out those people and organizations who are doing that.
5660,You might find them on social media or they might be doing email blasts directly to members of the public.
5661,That sounds like a good idea.
5662,Are the outlets you named random?
5663,Just read an article that hospitals are collapsing and that it's similar to Bergamo with patients being denied hospital access.
5664,Is that true?
5665,Seems a bit overly sensational.

5668,Bloomberg said 'a person familiar with the matter'.
5669,They're not about to risk their reputation on some random guy who has no insight.

5671,"&gt; Current Covid death rate in the us is ~2%, i do expect it to decrease over time."
5672,Not because a drop in morality but a increase in diagnosis rate.
5673,"Please learn the difference between Case Fatality Rate, and Infection Fatality Rate."
5674,I cant explain it for a 1000th time.
5675,&gt;I‚Äôm not sure what your argument is here.
5676,That most of our elderly don‚Äôt have to worry about a virus that killed 200k people?
5677,"Or trump must have been health despite getting O2, remdesivir, and monoclonal antibodies just because?"
5678,"I have a problem when people say someone was ""lucky"" to have survived Covid."
5679,It is the opposite.
5680,"If you get Covid, and you die from it, you are one of the unlucky ones."
5681,"The idea that Trump ""only managed to survive"" because of some super-expensive rare treatment is just silly."
5682,[removed]
5683,"Just like everywhere else, people in the cities here take it seriously and people in the country don't."
5684,It's not a Texas-specific problem aside from our state government failing to enact stricter regulations.
5685,"Yeah, I'm in Oregon and with summer over, people who were doing all their socializing outside are now moving inside."
5686,"I've also heard people say that kids going back to school is a instigating a lot of these spikes, and it isn't hard to see that being an influence too."
5687,I mean that‚Äôs all fine and dandy but people want to dance at weddings lol.
5688,"It feeds quite nicely into the news business model, don't you think?"
5689,Panic headlines get more attention.
5690,Yes thank you.
5691,It's an European law on privacy this site rather than complying just negates access to European visitors
5692,Drosten would be the German leading expert.
5693,"Spahn is just a normal political minister with little knowledge, but still a surprisingly good leading in this pandemic."
5694,Fear sells.
5695,Please don't spread shit like this.
5696,It's irresponsible.
5697,"I‚Äôm not necessarily bashing them, but stating some of them demanding that there is zero community transmission for 14 days is insanity"
5698,How did he die of complications?
5699,"Aside from the fact he got a placebo, he died from coronavirus at 28."
5700,Did he have any risk factors such as asthma or some respiratory disease?
5701,"Fine, let's hose him down with liquid oxygen!"
5702,"If U.S. states were autonomous and could regulate their borders, then some of us would be chilling right now."
5703,Just saying
5704,It is nice to know that supporting small businesses and supporting genocide now go hand in hand!
5705,"Man, politics really is getting simpler."
5706,Compelling argument.
5707,Right.
5708,"Even after it's available to the general public, it'll be an uphill battle getting it out to everyone unless some requirements are drawn up, like no return to offices/colleges/schools unless vaccinated &amp; have proof of it."
5709,"  this was a different doctors office, and I think they were actually trying to inject a dye for some test."
5710,It was several years ago and I only remember the fallout from it.
5711,"They sent me to a Quest lab for full workup, HIV, hepatitis, etc, etc."
5712,"Thank you for your time today, Dr. Yasmin."
5713,My question is about schools - I am both a public school teacher and the parent of a middle school student.
5714,"Is there truly a ""safe"" way for students to return to in-person instruction?"
5715,"Our community health experts are saying that there is no ""significant"" risk to return if numbers are low enough (right now we are at about 200 cases per 100K)."
5716,"Ahh, welcome to my world."
5717,I study the spread of misinformation and disinformation for a living and my family group chat is still often ripe with covid conspiracy theories.
5718,"While you may want to push back immediately (I know I do), this can feel like an attack and can result in making the person who shared the false info feel bad and just shut down the conversation."
5719,"It can be better to ask them where they came across the info (then talk about reliable sources), ask them why they believe it, and then start to counter with some accurate information."
5720,"That way you have an opportunity to have dialogue and in the future, when they come across false information, they're more likely to engage you in a conversation about it."
5721,There was a study recently that looked at people exposed to anti-science messages on Twitter.
5722,Those who just looked at the message and didn't discuss with anyone were more likely to believe the anti-science content.
5723,"Thoe who told a family member or friend, ""Hey, I saw this thing on Twitter..."" were more likely to be protected from believing the falsehood because a family member of friend was able to correct them."
5724,Even countries that were fairly successful in beating it back are having second waves.
5725,It‚Äôs not really individual responsibilities fault and that is kind of a cop out.
5726,Those countries do not have our legal system.
5727,I'm talking about an entirely different form of economic devastation than the one we are currently experiencing: one where every Fortune 500 company collapses and everyone who was working for them becomes unemployed.
5728,"Like it or not, virtually every COVID-19 death has created a legally valid wrongful death lawsuit for somebody: employers, nursing homes, schools."
5729,There will be hundreds of thousands of such cases.
5730,"It would take decades for the legal system to litigate them all, and it would bankrupt virtually every American corporation."
5731,"But, of course, this will never be allowed to come to pass."
5732,The Democrats might come up with a workers' compensation-style system where each death gets a standardized payout that the corporations can handle.
5733,"It means the whoever published the article is unaware, those involved would know exactly what they received..."
5734,"Good job so far, keep up the not dying!"
5735,Sarcasm is the refuge of the ignorant.
5736,"Anti-vaxxers looking at their bottles of homeopathic remedies: ""But I have been taking placebos for years, and it cured my coronovirus..."""
5737,"Considering the opening in the United States entering Phase 3 in quite a few places and rising infection/death numbers, I hope you're right."
5738,"Any additional taxing of our healthcare system, especially with another respiratory illness, would not be ideal."
5739,The headlines are there on purpose.
5740,They want to create fear in the reader otherwise they wouldnt use that title.
5741,They know very well what they're doing.
5742,a few comments above this there's a link to a guy who divided the nation into groups and showed them on a timeline where each area peaked at different times so far....i'd say at this point most everyone has gotten one wave.
5743,it's not clear what will happen for a second but with everywhere rising it's not looking too promising
5744,i thought they'd been suspended for a week?
5745,or is that only in the states
5746,"Well, from a clinical standpoint it‚Äôs actually good news."
5747,I know it sounds horrible.
5748,I don‚Äôt like that either.
5749,I haven‚Äôt seen them discredit the vaccine thing though so it‚Äôs a little off topic.
5750,Maybe try not jumping into situations with your divisive nonsense.
5751,"If I remember well, I believe we never went above 15% ICU occupancy due to corona in spring."
5752,"I think we have a good safety net in case we need one, but the government should take any actions necessary to avoid ending up in that situation."
5753,"I do find it encouraging that our incidence rates are set a lot lower than in most countries, but Merkel was not hard enough last Wednesday."
5754,"For Bayern or Niedersachsen, we already had these rules in place."
5755,"I believe BY is flat on a 7-day rolling average, but the trajectory is upwards for all states."
5756,"By next Wednesday, when we should be getting new rules, it will be 40-50% more cases numbers per day (today we just hit 10.400)"
5757,"Back during the smoke on the west coast, my husband and I were thinking of fitting a basket muzzle with N95 material."
5758,"It was a very remedial, off the cuff thought but I definitely think there is something that could be done to mask up dogs."
5759,The question would be if they could still detect the virus with a mask on.
5760,Lol nobodys life is meaningful so what's this all about
5761,"But their point was that it's still possible to get the flu after getting the flu shot, and yes, some of those people die."
5762,"For example, my mom gets the flu shot every year, but caught the flu this winter and coded."
5763,(Luckily they got her back.)
5764,"Sounds like your problem is with how the economy works, not with the idea of a lockdown."
5765,"Corporations have been consolidating control over the economy for decades, this crisis has just accelerated the process."
5766,An economy which collapses the moment output slows is not healthy.
5767,[deleted]
5768,I'm in Dallas and this has actually been my experience too.
5769,I can't remember the last time I saw someone in a grocery store not wearing a mask.
5770,"I'm not sure where the other person who said grocery stores have ""given up"" lives."
5771,I'm guessing the new spike is from people getting complacent about gathering with friends at home and/or going to restaurants.
5772,Bars here are technically still closed and I've seen places get their liquor licenses revoked for not following the rules.
5773,"We have had only about 2000 deaths outside of senior's facilities, over 7 months, among 37 million people."
5774,I‚Äôm not saying this is wrong.
5775,But statistically it may not be significant.
5776,The population is low enough that even a few deaths could dramatically change the rates.
5777,Same reason why the highest and lowest brain cancer death rates were in North and South  Dakota
5778,Trying to include only the regions that experience winter?
5779,they were saying he got the placebo
5780,"Apparently some europeans cant read it, so here's an AP news link to the same article."
5781,https://apnews.com/37fdcb046044483d256c612d4432d7c9
5782,I mean we could just make people who don't comply pay a tax to help fund the costs of their own selfish behavior.
5783,Not much different than cigarette taxes helping cover the insane costs of dealing with smoking related illness.
5784,No reason to make everyone pay.
5785,i really like the stacked graph design
5786,Today was a record global acceleration on the 7 day rolling average of new cases.
5787,67316 higher than the previous Tuesday.
5788,7-day average jumps 9616.
5789,"Except that you can‚Äôt control the behavior of others, like at all."
5790,"Plus if you live with someone who‚Äôs high risk, you might not be able to take enough precautions to protect them."
5791,Or if you‚Äôre high risk and have a job that requires your physical presence you‚Äôre just shit out of luck?
5792,It‚Äôs not as simple as your proposed individual actions.
5793,"More than anything, this pandemic has laid bare the fact that there is such a thing as PUBLIC health, and we are not at all islands unto ourselves."
5794,"Without national mandates for simpler precautions like masks and distancing, the more harmful economic actions have to be enacted when the numbers inevitably spike."
5795,"Your economic question also assumes that the deaths are of $0 economic consequence, which is demonstrably untrue."
5796,Texas and Florida didn‚Äôt do shit and cases dropped.
5797,Why?
5798,"&gt; you can sue

[Not if Republicans get their way and pass this legislation](https://www.vox.com/2020/7/29/21345228/liability-shield-mitch-mcconnell-republican-safe-to-work-act-gross-negligence)"
5799,Yikes.
5800,Really?
5801,:(
5802,As a previously 5-monther on the zero human interaction front....I‚Äôm just so bored now that I can‚Äôt take being alone anymore.
5803,Especially when seemingly everyone I know is out being social to some degree.
5804,"To be fair, my social circles are the late 20s / early 30s crowd, so on top of everything, almost everyone I personally know who has gotten it has been completely and utterly fine."
5805,"So I ebb and flow on the scared basis for myself, but I do recognize this isn‚Äôt about us and I want my parents (60+) to be fucking safe and happy again also."
5806,"The best we can do is likely ensure mask usage around compromised people, bc I live in a city where everything is still locked down and social gatherings/beach activities are still a weekly activity in the 5-20 person group range."
5807,"I teach in Texas, and that isn‚Äôt true where I teach - Austin."
5808,My husband tested positive and I am required to quarantine for 14 days by Austin Public Health.
5809,They work closely with Austin ISD.
5810,Students in the classroom are required to wear masks and any student that does not comply is sent home.
5811,"This is fake news and has been debunked 

Stop spreading misinformation"
5812,"Yeah, bullshit."
5813,"Just like ""TwO weEkS tO FlAtTen TeH cuRve!!1111!!!"""
5814,"Without normalizing to world population, it is mostly an irrelevant ""analysis."""
5815,"Also 241 deaths :(

Edit - also you can see that deaths are on the [upward trajectory once again in the UK](https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/country/uk/) (see deaths graph)."
5816,"Several weeks after cases started skyrocketing, which is consistent with the multi week lag period."
5817,"Large gatherings (as in 1,000+ people) have been happening this whole time?"
5818,"News to me, unless you're possibly talking about the racial injustice protests."
5819,"In California, if large gatherings were a thing right now, the Padres and Dodgers would not have played in empty stadiums during their playoff games in Petco Park and Dodger Stadium, respectively."
5820,"Even in states like Texas and Florida, that have had pretty loose restrictions for some months, people haven't been going to concerts and sporting events the ""entire time""."
5821,I think there needs to be a break in posting on this sub.
5822,Im thinking of unsubbing because I see the stats I dont need a barrage of fearmongering we all know people are dying.
5823,I don't understand why so many people care about the percentages.
5824,The amount of lives that were lost is how you should judge a pandemic.
5825,[removed]
5826,I'm in a virtual support group for people who had covid and a lot of people who got covid early on are talking about their second go round with it üò•
5827,The sad part is that you‚Äôre right.
5828,Killing the world economy will be way worse for everyone than cov will ever be.
5829,As a Swede I hated our what seemed nonchalant approach but at some point I realized how much worse it can get further on.
5830,"Our world economy is so sensitive now that many also has heavy mortgages and credits, losing a job now is seriously bad and even dangerous."
5831,OK lockdown skeptic.
5832,"LOL 
Obviously haven‚Äôt lost anyone to this pandemic."
5833,I'm specifically talking about the confusion over the format.
5834,Why wasn't such a format agreed beforehand or why did either AZ take so long to convert it or was the FDA not able to accept it in the original format?
5835,It still seems that there were unnecessary delays.
5836,Sharply increasing is relative....
5837,"&gt; They see a world on fire, that is losing traditions and the security that comes with routine, and they drown themselves in work, screens, substances, and food, until they sufficiently numb themselves to the reality: the rest of the modern world is light years ahead of the US in education, social policy and welfare, happiness, and yes, COVID response."
5838,"Well said, mate"
5839,We aren't locking down again.
5840,Arrrrrr!
5841,"Yes, whenever proximity to others warrants it."
5842,Generally I keep it off for most of a hike and mask up when passing.
5843,What were the demographics back then?
5844,"If they skewed younger, as Africa does today, it may have been barely a footnote."
5845,"Of course, we have no idea how good the reporting is in many of the nations, but from the stats we have, the continental numbers is ~0.024%

India is approaching the US' reported cases, but with around half the deaths so far."
5846,They skew younger too.
5847,What?
5848,What city?
5849,I watch the news almost daily and haven't heard that.
5850,"Half assed ""lockdown""."
5851,Fucking chaos.
5852,We had a family of 3 die here.
5853,"Patient privacy so il be short,but can describe the scenario to give an insight to what we see."
5854,Daughter goes into cardiac arrest from covid.
5855,"Mom tries to revive, unsuccessful."
5856,Mom catches covid.
5857,Dad catches from mom.
5858,Dad and mom icu.
5859,Dad dies first.
5860,Mom dies last.
5861,Staff brought the dad to the moms bedside for an hour before he passed so they could say goodbye.
5862,It hurts your health that you can travel to Europe during a pandemic?
5863,I think if my coworker has symptoms he will come to work anyway.
5864,You meant to type ‚Äúthere are many in development‚Äù I believe.
5865,No guarantee we will ever have a vaccine.
5866,"NZ is an island, entering without notifying authorities is next to impossible."
5867,"Europe and Americas are connected by landmass, it is not possible to stop every single human determined enough."
5868,It‚Äôs been 75 here in the states in the north east for the past 3 weeks lol.
5869,R0 doesn't have to be 10.
5870,"He's referring to a quirk of exponential growth where the *growth rate* at any given time is proportional to the number of people that already have it, leading to extremely rapid peaks."
5871,"There's an old brainteaser that goes something like this:

""A tiny speck of invasive algae is introduced into a new pond."
5872,The amount of surface it covers doubles every day.
5873,"After 30 days, the algae has completely covered the pond."
5874,"On what day did the algae cover half the pond?"""
5875,The answer is day 29.
5876,"This seems counterintuitive to many people, because half a pond isn't a whole lot, and yet it only took one day to go from half a pond to the whole pond, despite it taking 29 days to get to half the pond."
5877,But that's what it means to double every day.
5878,"In virus terms, doubling every day is equivalent to an R0 of 2 and a mean infection time of 1 day."
5879,COVID-19's actual numbers are an R0 of 2-4 and a mean infection time of 3-5 days.
5880,"That means that if 80% of Americans will eventually get COVID, then anywhere from 50-75% of those infections will happen in the final 3-5 days before the epidemic is over."
5881,"Countermeasures may change this a bit - if someone is limiting contact with others, they're not going to get infected."
5882,"Right now, R-e (effective R, including social distancing etc.)"
5883,ranges from about 0.8-0.9 in the Bay Area or Northeast to \~1.2 in areas that are hard-hit like the Dakotas or Europe.
5884,"But when restrictions are completely lifted, there's no reason to believe that R-e won't go back up to original R0 numbers."
5885,Yep.
5886,Was thinking about this myself the other night.
5887,It's going to be endemic.
5888,"Hopefully a vaccine will help a great deal, but it's not going to be eradicated."
5889,Nowhere else in the country has community spread even a tenth as bad as we had it.
5890,WE were the people nobody wanted visiting.
5891,Now our numbers look like the rest of Australia.
5892,"That was the whole point - to make the worst hit place less bad, so **everyone** could relax"
5893,No?
5894,Why do you put words in people's mouths like that?
5895,Give your head a shake... it's a fucking pandemic... Disney isn't a fucking priority lol.
5896,"Science bong, yes please."
5897,Jesus.
5898,Blame the government.
5899,I didnt even knew that the flu could kill prior to the pandemic.
5900,[removed]
5901,Cool.
5902,"Thanks for your assessment, random internet stranger."
5903,I‚Äôve followed all of my state‚Äôs protocols since day one and will continue to do so.
5904,I spoke in favor of masks and social distancing and shared my belief that eradicating a virus with strict lockdowns when it is CLEARLY already here in such a big way is absolutely delusional.
5905,"Maybe in January, but we blew it."
5906,"Unless we can get 100% of people to lock themselves indoors for several weeks with no exceptions, that plan is flawed."
5907,The fact that this ‚Äúsays something about me‚Äù leads me to believe that you are one of the anti-social woker-than-thous I mentioned above.
5908,"Enjoy your passive-aggression and the sense of superiority you feel by calling people‚Äôs opinions ‚Äúcringe‚Äù on Reddit, but also should realize that you know no more than any of us about this situation."
5909,Judging people based on their opinions on this or any matter also says quite a bit about you.
5910,Good luck in life.
5911,There's nothing to assume.
5912,A large chunk of our population are going to vote for herd immunity
5913,"Just posting news articles from permitted sources, with their original headlines as per the rules."
5914,"If you want to see different content, be the change you want: find other articles to post."
5915,Or unsubbing is an option.
5916,"People are still dying in large numbers, and it sucks, so I can see why you might not want to read about it."
5917,Hospitalizations are up 24% month over month but 8% week over week.
5918,Hopefully the curve up is going up at a slower rate and we reach a third peak soon.
5919,It literally said in the article that a patient had a rare spinal disease that may or may not have been cause by the vaccine drug.
5920,That's kind of a big deal when they're treating such a small number of patients for Phase 3 testing.
5921,Judging a state by its shithole areas.
5922,Good metric.
5923,Fuck the beautiful areas.
5924,Not to mention you can fit the entirety of the small northeast states inside Texas.
5925,Covid is a real danger to them as well.
5926,Quite a few funeral workers in NYC lost their lives at the peak.
5927,"They need hospital grade PPE, which most of them don't get."
5928,edit: typo
5929,Well it's good that they're sticking to the correct format no matter how minor it may appear.
5930,It shows they're following proper procedure which is nice.
5931,But why should percent matter?
5932,Isn't each human death worth something on its own?
5933,And all NZ effectively does is delay the inevitable.
5934,Even if a vaccine becomes available you will still have cases.
5935,Nothing is being forced.
5936,Some will want to be more careful.
5937,Nothing wrong with that.
5938,"If you‚Äôve already gotten it, it is very likely you can‚Äôt get it again any time soon."
5939,(Soon is the tricky word there.)
5940,"We don‚Äôt know how long immunity lasts, but I‚Äôd bracket it as probably more than 10 months, probably less than 10 years."
5941,The lower bracket is due to very few confirmed reinfections so far and the upper bracket is because we know other coronaviruses can reinfect the same people a half dozen times over decades.
5942,"That was a Dutch paper that came out in April, I think."
5943,So it seems likely immunity should last at least a year or so.
5944,"Hopefully longer, but I‚Äôm not an immunologist."
5945,My grandma passed today and my grandpa a few weeks ago.
5946,Take it seriously you filthy animals
5947,"its not convenient, its a matter of legality."
5948,Furthermore you're taken to a different area if you have Covid.
5949,How do you leap from flu shot to donating blood to pay for it?

6314,The positivity rate is hovering below 6% in India.
6315,But I‚Äôm guessing your anger is better than logic?
6316,So this virus has made it to enough house cats and minks that it probably will make it to all sorts of wild life and continue to circulate almost indefinitely making a vaccine all the more important as it can be reintroduced to an area where it's previously burnt out ( at least the human population).
6317,Sort of like rabies you'd have to exterminate near every mammal in the wild to permanently get rid of it.

6326,"Ok, I just did some quick googling and found that there are about 6 million car accidents in the US each year."
6327,I wouldn‚Äôt say that‚Äôs 90% of people being morons (maybe lucky morons?).
6328,With 6 million accidents it‚Äôs hard to get a number on how many actual people are affected.
6329,"But it looks like with coronavirus cases showing no signs of slowing down, plus us not having accurate statistics due to people being unable to get a test, we should be at the point where, if there are 2 people in each car involved in an accident, that should be about the number of people infected with COVID soon (12 million)."
6330,"On top of that, let‚Äôs compare death rates."
6331,"36,500 for car accidents vs. 221,000 for COVID *so far*."

6333,I didn‚Äôt escape the question.
6334,It‚Äôs right there in my comment: it will go away when we can eradicate the virus or at least get to the point where there are very few infections.

6336,I‚Äôm burning my masks the second I can.
6337,"Okay, I‚Äôm curious."
6338,You think people are trying to control us by asking us to wear a mask.
6339,Who exactly wants to control us?
6340,Why are they doing that?

6391,"The other three known coronaviruses that infect humans are SARS, SARS2 and MERS."
6392,"I'm not exactly sure what number you were quoting, but the general idea definitely lines up with the scientific consensus on viruses in general."
6393,awesome news!
6394,If we follow your solution all the way to its end .... then NOBODY would grocery shop themselves and EVERYONE would outsource it.
6395,Then who exactly picks out the groceries?
6396,Who exactly leaves their basement and risks visiting the deadly grocery store to pick out groceries?
6397,"You are comfortable with this idea because only SOME people outsource their grocery shopping and SOME people, inevitably those who make less $$$ and are less privileged versus those doing the outsourcing, actually take on a degree of risk."
6398,The greatest privilege in life is GREEN privilege.
6399,You appear to be one who benefits from green privilege.

6416,We delayed alot of infections and dramatically improved the HFR by allowing treatments/capacity to catch up.
6417,"Hey bud, you‚Äôre wrong on all 3 counts."
6418,&gt;The majority died early on....
6419,Negative.
6420,"The majority (51%) of deaths have happened since June, not all in the spring."
6421,&gt;You seem to be under the impression that we can stop or wipe out the virus.
6422,"Not at all, what gave you that idea?"
6423,At least not until we get a vaccine or better treatments that substantially reduce severity / fatality.
6424,&gt;So far [long term effects] are low probability and those same symptoms happen in other diseases as well.
6425,Huh?
6426,We do NOT have long term data on the side effects I listed for in survivors.
6427,The virus literally hasn‚Äôt been around long enough for studies to have been run on that variable.
6428,"Most of the A-game scientists and resources are focused on vaccines, diagnosis, and survivability right now, not longitudinal studies."
6429,"If the same symptoms exist for other diseases (I would argue this combination has NOT been seen for others which makes this one so damn insidious), they‚Äôre not in anywhere near these numbers."
6430,Get your head out of the sand and stop dismissing this with misinformation.
6431,It‚Äôs super not helpful.
6432,I'm just trying to figure out the math behind the 25% increase basically.
6433,I know the 117k has a some number of weeks to be added to it but I may be looking at the wrong thing as it's an increase in excess deaths not an increase in overall deaths so my first breakdown appears to be irrelevant.

6500,A news report came out recently that employees at the grocery store across the street tested positive.
6501,My mother died in June.
6502,I did not attend the funeral (14 day travel quarantine); the service was also limited to 10 people.
6503,"Since no one has posited it yet, I'd like people to try not to think about this in terms of an on/off switch with immunity."
6504,"I think from the beginning, or pretty early on, most scientists believed any immunity would have some sort of time limit."
6505,"Two years was an optimistic period, and it may turn out that 1 year is a bit optimistic."
6506,"However, what I think is happening is that different people will have different durations, and what we are seeing now are the lowest immunity periods possible (aside from a few very rare people), and given a case like NYC, I think this is probably the bottom 10% or we'd see it blow up more."
6507,But time will tell.
6508,"It may be that most people have about a year, or maybe more like half with most people having just 6 months."
6509,If the average goes lower than 6 months I think that's when things are going to seem sort of dire.

6560,"Bad news I know but, think each order can have frozen,  refrigerated, and dry goods, all of the room that takes."

6581,"I ended up staying home, and the sneezing stopped about 3 hours later, but during this sensitive time, I still thought it was better to stay home in case my issues was allergies (we did have a sudden temperature drop for a couple of days) than to risk my co-workers‚Äô health during this crazy time, even though we are required to wear masks at all times."
6582,"There would still be the risk of sneezing while eating to drinking water, that is never be able to live down if this is how I spread an illness."

6608,People arguing for herd immunity are either idiots or people taking an even more pessimistic route than most people here thinking that we're just going to be dealing with this no matter what we do and the restrictions are unsustainable.
6609,I haven't heard a single credible scientist argue for herd immunity outright.
6610,I've heard a few say we need to be more careful about our restrictions and make sure we weigh the public health pros/cons of closing businesses/schools.
6611,"Still, I don't think anyone touting herd immunity even thinks it will end the disease."
6612,They just think it will make the spread slow enough that we can contain it with decent public health measures while keeping the economy more intact and thus preventing other off-target public health crises.
6613,"Also, anyone who argues for reducing restrictions without increasing some other public health measure (e.g."
6614,"MASSIVE increase in testing/contact tracing, vaccine, etc...) is, imo, either an idiot or entirely not genuine in their intentions."
6615,I wouldn‚Äôt say nothing as we now know more about the virus and are further along in treatment and therapies as well as knowing more about how it spreads.
6616,This was a novel virus so we didn‚Äôt really know anything about it to begin with.
6617,Had we just let it run rampant many more people would have died and overflowed the hospital systems.

6892,"Then, they commit evil on you."
6893,"They bomb you, drive you out of house and home, kill your cousins because they mistook your cousin's wedding for a 'militant convoy', and are generally unapologetic about it unless their own media doesn't take a blind eye to that specific case."
6894,"Finally, they make a sad movie about how many of their soldiers died whilst massacring you and your people."
6895,"They say never again - not because they grew sick of killing people, but because their own killers are oh so precious."

6904,But we alrrady knew the first vaccines weren't going to be the beet ones.
6905,"Right now, they're looking for something that reduces the infection rate OR reduces symptom severity OR reduces death rate, AND that works in 50% of the people who get it."
6906,"As work continues, and they figure out more about the virus, then they're hoping for a widely distributable vaccine with sterilizing immunity, but that's *incredibly* unlikely in the immediate future."
6907,Do you think there could be a bias on that?
6908,Like; people might not seek testing unless they had worse symptoms?
6909,"&gt;I personally don't see how this information could be useful, but I don't feel like going against my first impressions right now, so I'm going to dig my heels in and decide it's just 'extra unnecessary'  - er - I mean - my real point, that there's no reason for it except to 'elicit an emotion'."

6914,I graduated later than my peers but I'm fully caught up now and I feel richer for the experience.

6927,"For some of these, they span over 100 years, but for some reason swine flu they only include 1 year worth of data?"
6928,"If the point is to compare the deadliness of covid vs all of these other pandemics, I wish they would look at ""1st year of deaths"" for each so that we had a true apples to apples."

6942,Own a good chunk of your company such as Facebook or Apple where everyone bought a lot of stock in to ride out the rocky stock market and they are going to get richer.
6943,A lot of millennial investors on Robinhood invested in Tesla jumping the stock from $72.25 all the way up over $500 at one point.
6944,So when Elon Musk owns 19% of the company and the stock multiples by 7 he is going to be a lot richer.

6961,"according to covid projections, it is thought that california has anywhere from 7% to 22% immunity."
6962,the measures we have now are the same we had before our major outbreak.
6963,so there wasnt really a change in how we approached things.
6964,I thing mask compliance increased though.
6965,The author of this article legitimately is just comparing raw death numbers without considering them as a percentage of the population?
6966,How is that a meaningful metric?

6968,The fact that we're even comparing this to the black plague with a straight face is absurd.

7095,"Congratulations, you fulfilled a roll that wouldn't be necessary if Betty and Margaret's kids loved them more and bought their food online for them."

7116,I'm not saying that the US was careful or smart about anything.
7117,The US has fucked up on a grand scale.

7119,"Adults can go and spend their days indoors in restaurants, bars or gyms, but kids can't go to school."

7150,That‚Äôs not the same thing as herd immunity.
7151,"I‚Äôm extremely pro vaccination and would never deny the importance of small pox, polio and measles vaccination."
7152,Having herd immunity means that enough people are protected so that uncontrolled spreading stops.
7153,"There was herd immunity in the population against small pox, but the unfavorable conditions with small pox being very contagious in combination with causing serious disease in the young population made it impossible to get enough control without vaccination."
7154,"It‚Äôs a bit holistic but the chinese restaurant study nicely mapped out transmission by seat number and distance from the vent 

Also we see people reporting cases from standing in closed rooms but we see fewer cases among maids/cleaners who clean the rooms"
7155,It's already proven impossible.
7156,20% of people infected develop no antibodies and can catch it again.
7157,This lock down is just a bit too short.
7158,A full elimination lock down needs to last between 8 to 10 weeks.
7159,It would be interesting to see the results of this.
7160,So far the only two countries that have executed a successful elimination lock down after widespread community spread are China in Wuhan and Australia in Victoria.
7161,"The lock downs in New Zealand were also very effective but they cannot be compared because New Zealand was proactive and took charge early, before widespread community spread, so their lock downs were shorter but also very effective."

7204,"It's challenging so many aspects or our society, but I expect the impact on healthcare/health policy will be lasting."
7205,I'm in Piemonte (about an hour from Lombardy) and not in a big city - I know our local hospital was packed but luckily managed to cope due to it being smaller and the lower population.
7206,"I hadn't read about the mega facilities, will be interesting to read up on thanks."
7207,"Wow, you figure out how a modern society works."
7208,You could always start a compound in Alaska if you don't like it.

7224,"&gt; once I get my vaccine I‚Äôm popping the mask off

Once I get my vaccine, I'm keeping my mask on because I think it makes me look cool, lol"
7225,A co-worker of mine was boasting on facebook how he had covid and it‚Äôs no worse than a common cold and how everyone‚Äôs being pussies for doing mail in ballots.
7226,This morning he just asked for prayers because his wife is in the hospital due to covid.
7227,He looks like a very intelligent person.
7228,I should probably listen to this guy over the experts because his opinion matches mine.

7230,Newer long hauler here.
7231,"A little over 2 months after my positive test, left quarantine August 23rd."
7232,"Having on and off tachycardia, fatigue, and shortness of breath with literally no explanation."
7233,Every test has been normal.
7234,It's put a huge damper on a lot of my plans for weight loss since I can't even walk a quarter mile without chest pains and losing my breath to the point I can't even go walking on my own in case I need help.
7235,I'm not even sick anymore and my O2 still sits a little low at 96.
7236,Heart rate kind of randomly jumps.
7237,"Wear your fucking masks people, and for the love of God, I'm not even religious, TELL PEOPLE IF YOU HAVE SYMPTOMS."
7238,"If my boyfriend's family hadn't deliberately hidden their youngest's symptoms from us when we went to use their smoker, I might not be stuck like this."
7239,Thank fuck I'm still under 26 and on my mother's insurance.
7240,Not sure what the hell I'm going to do If I'm still dealing with it in a year and a half though.
7241,Exactly.
7242,These people need to be cock-blocked when it comes to getting media attention.
7243,"Sure, and without adherence, there's no way you can draw conclusions about effectiveness."
7244,"""hey here's a rule""

""we're not gonna do that""

""see the rule doesn't work""

(btw, lots of people do adhere to recommendations and PPE rules, doctors, nurses, people who aren't complete morons etc."
7245,"and they seem to work to such a degree that it's a universal standard for medical care, not to mention the plethora of available scientific studies that demonstrate the measurable effectiveness of mask wearing)"
7246,The problem is that the flu vaccine isn‚Äôt particularly effective and at least the first round of Covid vaccines are likely to be just as bad.
7247,"If your vaccine is only 70% effective (better than expected) and only 50% of the population gets vaccinated (better than expected for any given year), you only end up with 35% protection."
7248,"Throw in the extra 1% for people previously infected (assuming immunity is perfect and long lasting) and we get 36% of the population protected which isn‚Äôt enough to get us to herd immunity and prevent community spread even if masking and social distancing compliance remains steady (which it won‚Äôt, people are sick of these things)."
7249,The American public needs to wrap its head around the most likely scenario here instead of the rosey painting the media and our tainted federal agencies have been painting since March.
7250,This is so much worse than the public seems to appreciate and it‚Äôs maddening for scientists to watch the public at large continue with risky behavior in light of what we currently understand.
7251,A two year duration to the pandemic seems less and less likely as things get worse and worse.
7252,"Yeah this is a bad POC situation for the account executive 

/sales joke"
7253,I read somewhere that only 20% of those infected actually infect others.
7254,"My sister came down with Covid19 about a month ago (I am from France but live in the US, so I only heard of it from my mom) and when she realized she had it,, she had been in contact with a ton of family member as she had visited the weekend prior including my 71yo grandmother, my mother has asthma )."
7255,She found out when she all of the sudden wasn't able to smell the scent of her shampoo while showering a few days later when she back in her college town.
7256,"She had a very mild case, basically just a small cold and she wasn't worried until the loss of smell."
7257,"She recovered within less than a week and is fine, now, smell is slowly coming back."
7258,It s been over 2 weeks and no one in the family and extended family got sick.
7259,Get used to it üòø
7260,"Good job, Bolsonaro, you got it right this time."
7261,What's that about Sweden?
7262,"They are at ZERO deaths, have been for so for a while, just take a look:

https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1315052624748535808

Don't know what kind of outdated data or propaganda you're getting, but there's a lot of smearing going on against Sweden, like the Business Insider article that they're adopting a lockdown policy, and Tegnell (their Fauci equivalent) had to issue a statement that no, they're not, and they have no idea why there was such a rumor"
7263,Let me be clear: I agree that that will be the final outcome.
7264,But it is because pretty much nothing has been done in the last two months to avoid getting to the situation where it is inevitable.
7265,"And the reason is because the hard and prolonged lockdown in the spring, without a real exit strategy, has cost so much political capital that now it is only possible to react when things get out of hand."
7266,NMN is a derivative of vitamin B3 currently being investigated for its longevity benefits.
7267,Because you don't have nearly as much control over international affairs as domestic ones.
7268,The law and state powers stop at defined lines and international broders are one of them.
7269,"You can't command other countries policies to do this and that, state power stops at the border."
7270,"Just like you can't control what the internet does and doesn't do, it's outside your enforcable area."
7271,But you can control what comes into your PC.
7272,"The first thing to do is to seperate all external connections, so you have one less introduction vector, you have cut off a steady non-controllable outside flow."
7273,You can use the same principle recursively within a country too.
7274,Same with when your bathtub overflows and your floors get wet.
7275,Do you shut off your tap first or do you keep wiping the floor while keeping the tap open?
7276,"The EU is a special case, because frankly, the Schengen agreement makes everything act as a single travel area to an outsider."
7277,What should have happened is a coordinated Schengen-wide tight border.
7278,"That way, you can at least keep out what's happening elsewhere outside your control and at least buy yourself time to deal with what's already going on inside."
7279,"A coordinated Schengen-wide approach might have been:

* Reroute all incoming non-Schengen air passenger traffic to a few key airports so you have fewer areas to deal with, deny all entry elsewhere
* Introduce unified procedures for all physical frontier border crossings, preferably only the essential ones so you can spare personel and focus on the large important crossings"
7280,"Lockdown is bad, but uncontrolled spread of COVID is worse."
7281,[deleted]
7282,100% this.
7283,How hard can it be to just stay at home for 2 -3 months and watch TV?
7284,"Hell, let's make Netflix free for all for that time."
7285,"If I'm not mistaken, it is the State of Sao Paulo the one testing the vaccine, not the federal government."
7286,"I don't know exactly how Brazil administration works, but it could be that the state buys the vaccine and not the country."
7287,This would be more credible if they had actually tested pupils proactively instead of just reporting on symptomatic cases.
7288,The asymptomatic cases that are still contagious is likely what's driving this.
7289,"I train detection dogs for a living; it is, indeed, very easy to add a new scent to a dog‚Äôs scent ‚Äúvocabulary‚Äù."
7290,We do it all the time in conservation and in search and rescue training.
7291,"What's interesting is that even in countries where the handling of COVID-19 has been successful and with minimal lockdowns, you see a particular group of people with a certain set of values that push the idea the pandemic is a political conspiracy and end up creating pockets of rising cases."
7292,Hmm.
7293,The problem is the system is regional.
7294,Meaning every region decides how to organize its healthcare system.
7295,So regions having less resources to invest might have a lot less margin.
7296,"Because let's be honest, none was actually permanently running 10x ICU beds (with equipment and staff) for nothing so we all know in southern italy the margin was extremely thin, if it even existed."
7297,"But a pandemic is a weird beqst, ironically what made lombardy healthcare one of the best in the country is what created the disaster."
7298,"Instead of investing in multiple facilities around the territory they decided to have ""super-centers"", so that they would allocate resources in a more rational way."
7299,That helped the virus spread quickly as soon as covid got there.
7300,Patients from all lombardy were visiting the same hospitals and after being sent home they took the virus with them.
7301,"&gt;Because if testing in March/April had been as developed as it is today (from June) the ‚Äúwave‚Äù we are seeing now would just look like a small ripple, not a wave."
7302,"It never ceases to amaze me what contortions the supporters of the Swedish ""strategy"" will go through to deny reality."
7303,"Back in March/April I was supposed to believe the numbers because they seemed to show Sweden was not doing that badly, but now that the numbers are higher than March/April, I'm supposed to believe those early numbers were false."
7304,"In the entertainment industry that is known as a ""retcon"":

&gt;retcon  
*noun* (in a film, television series, or other fictional work) a piece of new information that **imposes a different interpretation on previously described events**, typically used to facilitate a dramatic plot shift or **account for an inconsistency."
7305,"**

As for the ICU / Deaths... one problem with your argument... it doesn't take account of the dramatic improvements in treatments that have occurred since March/April."
7306,No country... no matter how bad its second wave has been... has seen as high a number of hospitalisations and deaths as they did in March.
7307,"For example:  
[https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/country/italy/](https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/country/italy/)  
[https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/country/spain/](https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/country/spain/)

You can clearly see that the numbers of cases per day is significantly higher than during the first wave, but the numbers of deaths is a fraction of what they were."
7308,"Using your argument, neither Spain nor Italy has seen a second wave, because the numbers of deaths has not increased to the level they were at during the first wave..."
7309,Nor is that data you wanted anywhere else (publically).
7310,"I base my analysis on the available data, not on guesses like you did."
7311,"Title reads: ""Federal government dying of COVID-19 after underfunding native healthcare for centuries."""
7312,... See how the definition changes?
7313,"*""Beware of the children of the old gods, for their verdict carries the weight of their fathers."

7317,What‚Äôs the point then?
7318,Either open the schools and deal with the risk or fucking close them.
7319,Dogs have more rights than Americans at this point
7320,Do you have any friends?
7321,Lol who doesn't shake hands to greet friends that's weird af.
7322,"&gt;I live in Victoria, we have been in lockdown for 6 months, because of people like you."
7323,No.
7324,You've been in lockdown for 6 months because people are not adhering the lockdown and are still spreading the virus.
7325,"&amp;#x200B;

&gt;And you have absolutely no idea of the social and economic consequences that doing so will bring."
7326,"What part of ""I have not touched anyone in 7 months"" did you not understand?"
7327,Do you think that has not had any impact on my mental health?
7328,"The longest in-person interaction I have had since March was two weeks ago, I got ice cream and talked with some friends for about 2 hours."
7329,Other than that everything has topped out at half an hour.
7330,Economic consequences: The government should provide economic assistance to people affected.
7331,"Instead of yelling at me, because apparently according to your standards I haven't fucking thought about killing myself ***ENOUGH***, how about you give some alternatives?"
7332,How about you tell me what the solution is?
7333,What then?
7334,Are you saying you don't think the vaccine will work?
7335,"I mean no one should be traveling internationally and refusing to shut down borders got us to this point and is now likely driving the second wave, but international travel is ""necessary"" I guess."
7336,"Well done EU, well done"
7337,"While I am not a religious person, I find it kinda hilarious that so many supposed Christians ignore most of what Jesus said."
7338,What do they expect to happen when they die?
7339,"He might forgive you, but I don‚Äôt think his Old Testament father will."
7340,"People should stop thinking that you can just go into stores or bars and not wear a mask if you are in company of your friends or family, put mask on, always."
7341,People here think that masks are just made for show :/
7342,I saw Mongol Steepe Horde Velocity at Lollapalooza
7343,"The Federal Government won't buy it (apparently, since this news was based on just a tweet)."
7344,The Sao Paulo state government has already bought  60 million doses of Sinovac.
7345,What does Florida have to do with this?
7346,"Politicians are especially at risk, they meet tons of new people everyday."
7347,I had no idea about him :/
7348,There's a shortage of tests and a shortage of labs/lab staff.
7349,"The more you test, the more negatives there will be too which turn out to just be the flu with similar symptoms, so I guess they're requiring certain symptoms to rule out the flu."
7350,"Just found out one of my staff's fathers probably has it because he was at a friend's last weekend who just tested positive  - he's sick with a cough and fever, and had to lie about losing sense of smell to get tested."
7351,"I feel your pain,teachers in our balkan country are working 4 shifts from 7:45 Am to 7 Pm,plus some of those teachers give us lessons online after their 4 shifts."
7352,"Their terminology wasn‚Äôt great, finding out who emits the highest viral load *is* useful."
7353,It was just bad reporting to assume that if you *would* infect more people than your average infected person in an enclosed space then you are a super spreader.
7354,I mean I‚Äôd take 3-6 months away from the end as amazing news at this point.
7355,Living with no end in sight is what has been the hardest from a mental wellness standpoint.
7356,I‚Äôll celebrate a vaccine for that reason alone.
7357,This is criminal behavior.
7358,How so?
7359,"&gt;wait until you have people knocking on your door that it's their God given right to trick or treat, and they can't believe you're not giving out candy this year."
7360,That's why there are no decorations and my house is gonna have lights off
7361,"Impossible without closing borders to all other countries, including other EU member states which would also have devastated the economy because you would have to keep the borders closed until the virus has been eliminated elsewhere."
7362,The strong lockdown was the thing that halted our exponential case growth and very high death rate initially.
7363,"Another thing to point out is that Italy's situation is bad, but it's not horribly worse than other EU countries many of whom are also struggling with implementing additional tough measures."
7364,I think its even more clear that hoping for vaccination and herd immunity is not a solution.
7365,"Eradication should be the goal, especially in places like Australia and New Zealand."
7366,Agree that you need to have a plan.
7367,"In the end another lockdown will be inevitable at this rate, but I suspect that they are trying to push that back as far as they can, but I can't see this going on like this for more than maybe 2-4 weeks at the most before that is the only option left."
7368,Same here.
7369,I cannot believe how stupid people are.
7370,"Like, yeah I get it, you don't want to shut the economy down."
7371,Neither do I.
7372,But you don't want to take a simple precaution to prevent it.
7373,"I‚Äôve seen chit chat on this sub (not in the daily threads, i‚Äôve noticed the daily threads have gotten a lot less pro lockdown) that another massive shutdown was coming in the US, likely if/when joe takes office."
7374,Hopefully it‚Äôs just people talking out of their ass.
7375,I‚Äôm throwing a fucking fit if we get quarantine theater again.
7376,"Not only the economy, but the psichological effects, the normal development in children, and a lot other social problems, it will sound cruel because it is, but the sick and old people have to die eventually..."
7377,check the science subreddit.

7388,I saw this video explaining what they think caused the Spanish Flu.
7389,They think it started in the US on a farm when a pig caught the flu from a bird and also from a human.
7390,"The pig infected the human with this new strain, and from there, it spread."
7391,"I don‚Äôt know all the science-y stuff behind it like how they traced it, etc."
7392,"However, just reading a few articles here and there, I understand that pandemic scientists do try to keep an eye on factory farms as well as bats and exotic animal markets because of probability."
7393,"&gt;S'pore

Is this really how the locals abbreviate Singapore in English?"
7394,Of all the nicknames you could have chosen for your country...
7395,"Nowhere in the world will people 100% adhere to recommendations and even if they did, they would definitely not adhere to PPE rules (replacing masks every X hours, not touching them, etc."
7396,).
7397,It'll be a while before we get this pandemic under control.
7398,Hopefully so.
7399,"And generally, just the peace of mind will be nice when things are controlled"
7400,LOL at the all of the out of staters moving to Montana to avoid COVID who are arriving just in time for the big outbreak *and* winter.
7401,They'll be finding themselves back in civil unrest soon enough too as they are driving up the cost of living so high the normal people who have lived in the state for generations can't afford to anymore.
7402,we're not gonna get this virus under control anytime soon
7403,So your solution then is to allow more people to die.
7404,You would rather Americans be six feet underground than behind bars.
7405,The greatest problem with all of this.
7406,"We should take our health into our own hands, like it always was before."
7407,If you‚Äôre at risk?

7409,Easy as that.
7410,[removed]
7411,I'll give it a try.
7412,Thanks.
7413,It certainly won't.
7414,"From the start, the goal has been to drive this to be endemic."
7415,The messaging that we are somehow going to manage to eradicate it needs to really stop.
7416,It creates this false reality that all the experts know full well is a pipe dream at best.
7417,"If you're in the Portland area and find yourself needing a test, I got a rapid test with no symptoms at ARC Urgent Care a few weeks ago."
7418,"Maybe things have changed since then, but they were doing travel related/possible exposure testing and symptomatic testing."
7419,They have the furthest ahead vaccine in the world.
7420,Oxford and Moderna are the only ones that are close.
7421,I thought it was really well done and very informative!
7422,"well, political capital is important however."
7423,"But you need to have a plan, reacting when things are already out of control doesn‚Äôt count."
7424,So they are testing a vaccine that they ultimately won‚Äôt buy (despite having already agreed to buy the vaccine with the manufacturer).

7436,Would you recommend it?
7437,"Yeah, whats your solution?"
7438,Lockdown for over 5 years?
7439,"Im not willing to do that, I prefer to die from coronavirus, specially for young people this is not fair."
7440,Superficial article
7441,Has anyone watched Totally Under Control on Hulu?
7442,The situation will get out of control before Xmas at this rate
7443,&gt; Going to school is really vital for children.
7444,"They get their meals in school, their physical activity, their health care, their education, of course

This made me laugh."
7445,Why are they depending on schools for meals and health care.
7446,"The problem isn‚Äôt keeping schools open, it‚Äôs the shitty system outside of it."
7447,"When these are half of your reasons for opening them, you aren‚Äôt recognizing the problem and it will always be an issue."
7448,I feel like this is a dumb question.... but are ‚Äúsuper spreaders‚Äù called this because they generally interact with more people or because they are carrying a higher viral load?
7449,Or are they contagious longer than others?
7450,"&gt; once people who would die from this 

That‚Äôs basically everyone."
7451,This thing has killed people of all ages and health levels.
7452,"It may be extremely rare in some cases, but it‚Äôs still a thing."
7453,"As a seattle resident, I believe we got spared because the tech executives/amazon had insider information about how bad things really were and started keeping their employees home super early."
7454,"I mean its not like its *that* far away, especially considering most schools are closed most of December anyway"
7455,[Yup](https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/jf5jy2/pennsylvania_cat_dies_of_covid19_officials_warn/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share).
7456,well you could always reverse engineering the vaccine's formula and make your own

7458,Simple.
7459,"It‚Äôs a very recent development that the government can put blanket, national shutdowns into order in the name of public health."
7460,Reality doesn't give two hoots about political capital.
7461,It will win out every time.
7462,1918 Flu was far more deadly though.
7463,"And we didn't have nearly the same level of technology and hygienic practices we do now, that's a bad comparison."

7469,You always miss one spread to others.
7470,Is this sub becoming more positive?
7471,Sore throat can definitely be a first sign of COVID.
7472,"Early COVID can be totally indistinguishable from a cold or the flu, which is why this thing can spread so efficiently."

7480,I also read every issue of the therapist magazines she got.
7481,"The editorial about Trump's election was friggin hilarious - watching someone trying to say ""this man is shit and the next four years will be characterized by fire, blood, poverty, hatred and disease"" but only using extremely gentle, non political, non committal professional language was really interesting."
7482,"Basically, they knew they were going to have a lot of work in the near future."
7483,Most of them care about their clients snd genuinely want to help.
7484,"Everyone is worth helping to someone; some therapists find the ""worried well"" frustrating."
7485,"These are people who have financial and relationship stability and no health or addiction issues, generally have few or no major traumas in their past but just don't feel right - their problems are ""all in their head"" or are biochemical depression/anxiety related."
7486,They often have the same issues at the same level low to modert level of intensity for decades.
7487,"The therapists that find WW frustrating want to work with people who have had major traumas, rape, early family loss, etc and such and are still changing and growing a lot, maybe they're more difficult but more rewarding?"
7488,Others prefer the worried well and relate to them better; while they feel underqualified to deal with specific heavy traumas.
7489,"They're very conscious of areas of specialization - my ex would never have included LGBT+ specialization in her qualifications even though she did take specific courses, at a real-ass college (smith and mt Holyoke), about that and has had those clients, because she had a higher standard for herself than to think that was enough."
7490,"Some things she was super underinformed about, like illicit drugs."
7491,"(Also, they believe individual therapy is crucial but basically none of them believe marriage counseling works."
7492,"They all think your marriage is doomed, both because they think people show up to counseling when it's already too late by a count of years, and because they think couples counseling isn't super effective in general."
7493,"Yes, even the couples counselors said this to each other in private as I sat nearby."
7494,One said it was like CPR on a person who'd been dead for a year.
7495,"like it only helps so much even when it's done in time)

And in general, it's all about matching person to person, almost like dating."
7496,"You might have a good therapist who cares, but isn't good for You; isn't good at helping Your particular issues, or one who isn't great overall but works well with you."
7497,I assume my child's mother is good at her job; I have no reason to believe she isn't.
7498,I know she's a caring person.
7499,But damn did she not know how to listen.
7500,Almost everything I said was misinterpreted or twisted into something so off base it was often comical.
7501,I used to feel like I had to literally beg her to not read between the lines before almost every communication.
7502,"I started writing letters and texting instead of talking, even in the same room, so that she couldn't stop me after every sentence and recontextualize it in real time."
7503,"I'd say ""please, please, I'm literally begging you, if you want to show you care about me, please respond to the most literal interpretation of my words."
7504,"Take them at face value and believe that I mean them in a very direct way; there is no subtext, do not decode, do not interpet."""
7505,I had that witten down on an index card and read it off to her before any important thing I had to say.
7506,"I didn't have that problem with relationships before her, and I don't have it with my current partner - misunderstandings happen at times but they're exceptions, not rules, and words work like they should 99% of the time."
7507,"I know I sound like I'm dumping baggage and kind of am, in general I accept plenty of fault and responsibility for mistakes in that relationship but that's off topic, I only bring it up because it's about therapy and communication, and the point is compatibility - I'm not saying my ex was a bad therapist, I saw how hard she tried for her clients and I know she cared, she was generally diligent about following protocols and doing things right although she did tell me some things about certain clients, but for one person at least, she couldn't even hear and understand basic communication."
7508,"Like I told her once when I was angry, you're a distant alien planet of a woman."
7509,But distance is relative to position - she surely makes more sense to people who aren't so distant.
7510,She seems to have a good relationship with her current BF; they must communicate more effectively.
7511,"Maybe in a clinical context she was different, IDK, she never treated me."
7512,Seeing her talk to her family explained a lot - none of them hear each other and parsing out the meaning of what someone says to extremes is *required* to function in that house.
7513,"And meeting her sister, who was like the same way but without the good intentions...

Also, she said ""oh don't tell your friends too much about my job or tell me too much about their issues, in case one becomes a client and you figure it out""."
7514,"And I was like.. ""what?"
7515,What are the chances that one of the like 50 people tops I count as friends needs therapy and cold calls you in particular?
7516,"This isn't like a rural small town.""."
7517,"Well, I was super wrong."
7518,Two of them did so apparently... much more likely than I thought.
7519,"One she turned away, because she already heard too much about him from me to treat him I guess, the other she treated."
7520,"She wouldn't admit who it was but I could tell because she did say some basic things to me about her clients, no identifying details but general situations, and for this one she was suspiciously tight lipped."
7521,Also I saw her name on some papers lol.
7522,"My ex was just like ""I'm not going to tell you if I'm seeing her or not, and you can't ask her about it""."
7523,"I was like.. ""uh.. how would I even know who I'm asking if it's not the same person üòÖ?"""
7524,"I guess lots of people need therapy, and there aren't that many different providers."
7525,She was seeing six or seven clients at the most as I recall and felt that was close to her limit.
7526,This was all pre pandemic.
7527,"They're absolutely swamped now, and stressed themselves."
7528,Therapists are traumatized by their patients routinely.
7529,"They get the life kind of sucked out of them a little bit every time, and are very aware of that - they learn it in school."
7530,"So they're generally required to have a therapist themselves, where they can vent about clients and drop the veneer of professionalism."
7531,"They call them ""supervisors"", although they're not above them in a hierarchy or anything."
7532,Joe could supervise sally who supervised Sasha who supervised Joe.
7533,"And they're super focused on mitigating and avoiding stress in their own lives, and self care ""filling your own cup"" because they'll burn out quickly if they don't and will do a shit job as well as be personally miserable."
7534,Nothing dark or awful was acceptable as conversational topics in daily life; she had too much darkness at work to discuss anything bad at home.
7535,"I'm kind of a.. i dunno, generally pessimistic or dark person, kind of a lapsed anarchist who thinks humans are just flawed selfish animals who probably won't ever really fix their problems meaningfully and that new forms of oppression form a s quickly as old ones are reduced."
7536,"I'm mean everyone has multiple perspectives; on an individual level I think people can make huge strides and can totally rewrite their lives and become great and happy - I certainly improved my own life by a huge margin - but that individual improvements don't scale effectively or consistently or sustainably enough to derail the momentum of all the gibbering, cannibalistic horrors of history."
7537,I'm just explaining how my perspectives and hers didn't meet.
7538,Seeing more patients can be really lucrative - the difference between 6 and 10 could mean a huge increase in income - but it's seen by many therapists as unethical to see more than you really feel you can handle.
7539,"She was always talking about these two other therapists in town that saw like 15 people or something, saying they couldn't possibly be doing a good job for that many people and were just in it for the money."
7540,Also therapists don't trust psychologists lol.
7541,They all agreed on that.
7542,"Anyway, I know this went long, hope my ramblings gave you some context on the situation."
7543,"Speak english, so we can understand the stupid things you say."
7544,stonks up*
7545,[deleted]
7546,"*recommendations*

You mean the lockdown."
7547,"What happened, I thought everyone knew lockdowns ""don't work""."
7548,Congratulations.
7549,Live in a college town of ~20k in Kansas.
7550,The hospital is nearly full.
7551,"Wasn't a problem until now, because we have lots of small regional hospitals that could pick up the slack - they're full too."
7552,Soon Patients could have to be driven three hours to Wichita or two to Kansas City.
7553,Seems like there are less people infected than you predicted.
7554,Lets see what the coming days will bring.
7555,Call it what it is.
7556,People are deliberately spreading the virus.
7557,I'm in Iowa.
7558,"Check out a  HyVee (grocery store where masks are ""recommended"")."
7559,Sometimes compliance is pretty good-75% or so.
7560,Sometimes 90%+ aren't wearing a mask.
7561,They know exactly what they are doing.
7562,We do that already in Germany.
7563,But contact tracing is limited with app because of data and privacy protection.
7564,They‚Äôve seemed to have curbed the spread of falling out of windows though.
7565,We had hardly any outbreaks at schools in Germany.
7566,Just like that immigration crisis that stopped being an issue after the election.
7567,Nature knows no mercy..
7568,"They really had luck with weather, now it starts getting cold there too."
7569,[removed]
7570,"*Paddy 

And no that‚Äôs such a weird thing to do, just have a pint like a normal person."
7571,"Exactly, this is more like the 13th deadliest pandemic^(for white people (as someone pointed out below).)"
7572,Ireland had an extremely effective lockdown too.
7573,They were down to single digit cases in June/July but once the schools went back and we opened our borders (particularly with Northern Ireland which is in the U.K.)  the cases are rising like crazy.
7574,It's officially the third wave with each being smaller.
7575,And America is busily sitting on top of the first wave as it gets bigger and bigger and the water starts to disappear in front of it.
7576,The view of your house is probably reassuring ATM but it's gonna destroy everything.
7577,1 million by Christmas.
7578,"At least in Massachusetts, [the early lockdown did *not* lead to an increase in suicides](https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19/comments/jew5gs/suicide_deaths_during_the_stayathome_advisory_in/)."
7579,"Most countries are following a wave pattern, I think measures aside, it is how these things play out"
7580,"Since you are a college student, tell me about something I have been wondering lately."
7581,"You go out and everybody is wearing a mask, how do you get interested in someone?"
7582,"When I was your age I would be walking around the campus, in a mall or in the street and I saw someone I liked and approached her."
7583,Now everyone has masks and this is going to last for months to come.
7584,I know you still can be attracted to people on masks but aren't the face features the most attractive to the other gender?
7585,I know there are apps but the nicest way to know people is outside in real life.
7586,So how is all this going to work?
7587,Yeah and you are probably right.
7588,"Also, I know less then 5% about biology."
7589,"So here is my opinion üòÇ

No, let‚Äôs ask a question insteadü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

Didnt this article explain that the virus actually got a bit worse and became a silent over time before it jumped on humans?"
7590,So why wouldn‚Äôt it then continue this path?
7591,"Couldn‚Äôt it be just a stupid virus like you have stupid people, not realizing it‚Äôs also killing itself by becoming more killing each mutation?"
7592,Why do we assume that a virus knows what it‚Äôs doing and become milder over time to ‚Äúlive‚Äù a longer ‚Äúlife‚Äù?

7594,"Slightly inaccurate headline, you might want to repost."
7595,Russia has a record for new deaths but had more new cases yesterday.
7596,And the new conspiracy will be appear
7597,Well done ex ZSSR nations.
7598,"/s 

The denial is catching up."
7599,Good luck on your degree!
7600,What you described must be a bit like hell.
7601,:/
7602,"No, no, completely incorrect."
7603,"The ""data"" does not show that *at all*."
7604,Countries with early lockdowns did better.
7605,The countries that did best all had lockdowns.
7606,The best argument Tegnellists have is that there are 12 countries that enforced lockdowns too late and are doing slightly worse than Sweden.
7607,"Tegnell and Giesecke said early about our neighboring countries, ""wait a year and see""."
7608,"It's 8 months now, nobody is even close to catching up."
7609,Nobody seriously believe they will catch up.
7610,Sweden just failed completely because they were too lazy to do the right thing.
7611,"Yes but this is a new one, added on top of that."
7612,And it was possible to slash those numbers heavily.
7613,Your mentality is part of the problem.
7614,And India will not pass USA.

7616,Can always get a second wave if you try hard enough
7617,"&gt;No, not true for the residents of Uppsala."

7624,That being said there is will be some herd resistance at some point.
7625,The question is when.
7626,"Try not quoting single sentences and spam responses to them, It's the mark of a troll."
7627,*This is not true.
7628,Nothing changes.
7629,"All they do on a regional level is to impose new advisories, and possibly close bars/restaurants earlier (as the municipalities can do that)."
7630,"*

""It's totally not a lockdown even though it's a lockdown because it's not enforced""."
7631,Not convincing.
7632,*No!

7635,"Stay home if you are sick, avoid unnecessary travel, keep distance, wash your hands."
7636,"*

No, not true for the residents of Uppsala."
7637,That's what the author is talking about.
7638,"Also I really hope you're not living ""under mantras"" from spring."
7639,There's new information about asymptotic spread and mask wearing.
7640,*He is the head part of an organisation of around 400 people at Folkh√§lsomyndigheten.
7641,He is not one person making these decisions.

Just like Donald Trump then."
7643,"Nobody cares, we place responsibility on him."
7644,"Has nothing to do with ""competence""."
7645,"If you read the FHM leaks, Tegnell himself has low competence in both disease prevention and writing."
7646,‚Äã
7647,Some people still don't get it is why ... hence the continued attempts to represent the data in different ways.
7648,I couldn't find info so I guessed based on what I know
7649,It's not nearly as bad as the first wave yet from a data perspective.
7650,Don't spread misinformation.
7651,"Here's a good article

https://www.economist.com/briefing/2020/09/26/the-covid-19-pandemic-is-worse-than-official-figures-show"
7652,imagine if a time traveller came back and told trump he needed to do all this stuff even though most people will hate him for it so that in 17 years a virus we dig up from Antarctica (which due to climate change we are now mining) doesn't wipe everyone out because the antibodies of covid help neutralize it.
7653,"""you could make a religion out of this..

no don't."""
7654,We're all frogs in a pot of water that slowly starts cooking.
7655,Almost?
7656,"My girlfriend, who I live with, and her dad are going down to Ohio in a couple weeks to help her sister move to New York."
7657,Her sister doesn‚Äôt take this virus as serious as we are.
7658,She goes out to restaurants pretty frequently and her boyfriend also has gone to a couple parties and to California to visit family.
7659,"I‚Äôm a little scared cause my girlfriend and I haven‚Äôt gone out except for groceries, just for groceries."
7660,Am I over reacting?
7661,Internet economist here.
7662,I predict the economy will be making a ‚ò≠-shaped recovery
7663,What the hell are you talking about?
7664,This is ALWAYS how study results are reported.
7665,There is inherent error in each study and the responsible thing to do is not misrepresent data.
7666,"Governor Stitt for brains thinks we don't need a statewide mask mandate, just a person in charge of available COVID hospital beds."
7667,smh
7668,Don‚Äôt listen to this person lol.
7669,That‚Äôs not the ‚Äúreal‚Äù point of college.
7670,College is for an education (yes to get a job) AND a huge fun life experience.
7671,"There isn‚Äôt a time in your life, at least as a responsible adult, where you can hangout and/or party with your friends everyday of the week, live within a 1 mile radius of all your friends,  and choose to skip out on your responsibilities for the day with little consequences...the list goes on."
7672,College is a once in a lifetime experience and I am really sad for everyone who doesn‚Äôt get to experience that right now.
7673,"Doing all that after college is possible, but it‚Äôs definitely not the same."
7674,"If getting a job is the only thing people think they‚Äôre getting out of college, they‚Äôre doing it all wrong."
7675,I hope so.
7676,"People aren't getting it, still."
7677,I'm getting wedding invitations to receptions that hard been postponed from the summer like it's all clear to be going to eat off a taco buffet with 50 or so other people.
7678,People think they just need to be going on with their lives &amp; that's why it's spreading.
7679,"My sister attended my grandfather's funeral the day after I had surgery &amp; said nobody was in masks, everybody was hugging everybody &amp; nobody seemed to give a shit."
7680,"She traveled in from Virginia for the funeral on a plane- if she would've had it, could've given it to every damn person there."
7681,I also wonder how much is being spread from people traveling into the state?
7682,I notice a lot more people taking those postponed trips &amp; coming back or family from other states traveling in to visit and demanding to see you.
7683,Both of those situations people are being asked to quarantine first but are they?
7684,Hell no.
7685,If they were worried about their health they wouldn't be traveling in the first place.
7686,South Korea can pretty much be considered an island as well.
7687,Their only land border is the most fortified border in the world.
7688,"Thailand and
Vietnam is a bigger mystery."
7689,I just want to say that some of us who live in Wisconsin are STAYING home.
7690,My daughter has not played with another child since March 14.
7691,She talks to her stuffed animals pretending they are friends (I could not imagine sending her to preschool).
7692,"My husband has left his job because he would not be able to avoid the risks, and I am working two jobs from home to try to mitigate the financial damage."
7693,I was on this sub when the virus was only still in China.
7694,We have seen people from our street taken away in ambulances with EMTs in hazmat suits (we are downtown and in a city).
7695,We understood what this could mean for our family if we get it.
7696,"We have no one to help, so if one of us ended up on a ventilator with longterm consequences or worse, our lives and our child's life would be impacted forever."
7697,We are very far from rich.
7698,"We have debt, we have mortgage."
7699,"We are regular people who have been ""hunkering down"" since March and will continue to do so until it is safe to continue with ""normal life."""
7700,I am appalled and horrified by the ignorance and selfishness of the people around us who go to bars or gather on Friday evenings in large groups to socialize.
7701,"When all this is over, I think I will consider options of living elsewhere, where life, science, and community mean more than they do here."
7702,So no one in the entire country leaves their house... for any reason at all.
7703,Realllllllly.
7704,"Trump told people not to wear masks lol, after that anything he says comes off as shit."
7705,"&gt;Hope Biden

How about he wins first."
7706,"No fucking chance his political advisors let him do that, or that GOP governors even follow"

7714,"Looking at [mobility data](https://www.teliacompany.com/sv/om-foretaget/uppdatering/mobility-analysis/) we can see that that recommendations had an effect about a week later than as neighboring countries, lower though - just because you can go to a cafe during the pandemic doesn't mean that people will go there."
7715,Stockholm was a ghost city.
7716,"If an organizer only can host 50, or even 500 people, they won't book big artists."
7717,"Lot's of public places also closed down, like museums and sports, heck, the state casinos are still closed."
7718,"If you cross-check Norway's and Sweden's restrictions/recommendations you will see that they don't differ that much, except for timing."
7719,"With the actual effect of peoples behavior it was even less different, but the outcome of deaths are much greater."
7720,"I think short lockdowns are a great tool, if you are totally overrun or do it with perfect timing, but that window had already been closed by that time."
7721,All I'm saying is that it's not so black and white that everyone seems to think.
7722,"Yeah, obviously."
7723,Basically only Belgium's death toll might be inflated.
7724,As if we ever bothered tracing
7725,They're not stupid.
7726,It's worse: it's malicious compliance.
7727,317 new deaths and 15700 new cases.
7728,[https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/country/russia/](https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/country/russia/)

7733,Here's my issues with trick or treating.
7734,We know the virus lives on plastic for a while..what is candy wrapped in?
7735,So you now how folks who've been isolating in therr homes filling candy bowls.
7736,What if someone has covid in that home?
7737,A healthy member hands out the candy..germs from sick member already on that candy.
7738,And even if ya leave the damn bowl out..what happens when the kids all congregate around the bowl outsids your door?
7739,Maskless adults and kids?
7740,Great youve got a door shut and a barrier.
7741,But whats preventing those outside from getting sick?
7742,How do you stop kids from running at a bowl of candy?
7743,How do you get adults to make there kids distance?
7744,"How do you explain to kids yet again ""sorry we cant be with friends or trick or treat with them."
7745,"We could kill them if we play together right now...heres a lollipop now watch the great pumpkin""

Im a mom of 3 kids..halloween is my favorite."
7746,And even accommodating with a hunt in the backyard for candy it just isnt the same.

7748,Not all business owners are rich
7749,Ideally we‚Äôd limit things like shopping and allow schools but this is America where consumerism is more important than a proper education.
7750,"Come to florida, where our governor says COVID is mission accomplished and everything is open and back to normal!"
7751,More like the same seven guys insisting we have to live life after everyone else has been doing so for ages
7752,Lol that is a really weird headline.
7753,‚ÄúEquivalent to‚Äù wtf does that even mean
7754,People do that?
7755,Thats insane.
7756,Yeah sorry my maths are wrong..
7757,I never multiplied by 100 to get percentage!
7758,General point still stands though.
7759,"I'm in no way downplaying covid, just saying that in terms of deaths it's barely going to register as a blip when people look back at the history of humanity."
7760,Social and societal effects are what this will be remembered for in future
7761,"I am not familiar with what how they're doing, but i hope they're going to cities like Detroit, Atlanta, Honolulu etc."
7762,where a lot of of the population falls in a minority.
7763,"Heck, Hawaii is majority asian right?"
7764,"While I agree that Americans like to laser-focus on themselves, comparing American deaths from Covid to worldwide deaths from the Vietnam war would be stupid."

7782,"Gyms are risky because people are breathing heavily as they lift weights, not necessarily because they're touching surfaces, although that's always been a sorta disgusting aspect of going to the gym, so you should probably just wipe things down anyway."
7783,"I've used the checkbox to turn off substitutions and I've explicitly added instructions for ""NO substitutions"" and it makes no difference."
7784,I'm lucky if half of what I order is available and they try to make substitutions anyway.
7785,"Most of the substitutions are much more expensive, so maybe that's pressure from the store to do it."
7786,I've also found I have to carefully check what they do deliver.
7787,"Once, the bag with all the most expensive meat and cheese never showed up."
7788,Wonder where that went?

7790,and do bong hits!
7791,I'm honestly happy with my decision to leave the hospital and the Covid units behind.
7792,It went from taking care of people that don't care about taking care of themselves to taking care of people dying from Covid because they didn't care or their families didn't care and I'm just done.
7793,My wife and I were at the store recently and a group of maskless shoppers were looking at us in our masks and chuckling.
7794,Arrogant and entitled.
7795,Never had to try to keep someone alive.
7796,Never had someone die in front of them.
7797,"Never consider what it must be like, or that it might happen to someone else because ""muh freedoms."""
7798,Must be nice.
7799,The culture goes beyond the schools.
7800,"Japan and South Korea have way more authoritarianism in their school system, yet their citizens asked what their governments asked them to do."
7801,China's economy literally recovered and movie theaters are open again.
7802,But some people on /r/all still think it's fake news.
7803,They completely ignore the independent evidence such as flights from China to other countries have nearly no positive cases.
7804,Funny how when antifa kills someone the cops gun them down and when the modern nazis kill someone the cops wait till the next morning and peacefully arrest them.
7805,It feels like the clear message is liberals don‚Äôt deserve trials but faccists deserve their day in court
7806,I added far more value than you have.
7807,"No, I'm ""assuming"" COVID is much more mild because literally all the evidence shows that it's more mild."
7808,"Over 2 in 100 people on the planet died from the pandemic in 1918, and yeah, you could argue that there might have been some counting errors, but to say COVID is comparable, they'd need to be counting something like 5 dead for every 1 pandemic death."
7809,"When we include demographic shifts, we see that COVID is extremely non lethal to young adults and children, and those demographics made up a much larger percentage of the 1918 population."
7810,This isn't even really a debatable idea that you're presenting.
7811,You have no logical argument as to why this wouldn't be the case.
7812,The idea that people were asymptomatic during the 1918 pandemic is irrelevant.
7813,Over 2% of people who were alive on the planet were killed by it.
7814,"COVID would almost certainly not kill 2% of the people on the planet if every person got it and hospitals didn't exist, because the IFR of this virus is estimated at under .6%, and the IFR for 50 year olds is estimated at under .06%, with it dropping to under .01% for people under 30."
7815,"It's just not a lethal virus to the young, and the 1918 pandemic was especially lethal to the young."
7816,"Republicans, please keep fucking up so we can kick your ass even more in 2 weeks."
7817,"Me too, I haven‚Äôt been able to find cinnamon altoids in forever!"
7818,ETA they are back on Amazon lol.
7819,Not a bug but a feature.
7820,No antibiotics for the pneumonia.
7821,No steroids for the cytokine storms.
7822,"No oxygen, great IV fluids, etc."
7823,"People that don't wear masks, don't get tests."
7824,People that are wearing masks are getting tested and we blame the mask wearers?
7825,"I personally use one around other people but not outside, I don't care what other people do as long as they if they have symptoms they mention it to me, I'd have alot more respect for them with or without a mask."
7826,I didn‚Äôt know others felt the same.
7827,"Thanks for serving btw, glad you made it out okay üôÉ

And thank you, it‚Äôs tough out there in the job market right now."
7828,Texas is so dumb and so evil.
7829,Florida takes it though.

7831,"&gt;Nope, but funny that you completely misrepresent your statement into one where you come off as a saint."
7832,I can't misrepresent my own statement.
7833,You're the one doing that and we both know it.
7834,&gt; You literally made a post about it.
7835,I look at people's submission history to avoid the inevitable conversation with a teenager.
7836,And now you come off as an insane stalker.
7837,Congrats.
7838,You can't bring anything to this discussion so you have to derail it with irrelevant stuff.
7839,I suspect we will see the impact of some of this until well past the end of the virus although more subtly.
7840,"For me my ""hobby"" math (I enjoy building models and do so for my day job, but can't claim to have scientific rigor on this question, more a nerdy interest in the problem space) suggests that the overloaded healthcare system was a far larger short term impact on non-acute symptom diagnosis as hospitals and care providers had to triage their resources independent of the lock down (as we can see even now in states that are hitting or approaching hospital capacities in certain regions - there are only so many doctors, nurses, beds, lab capacity,  and there is a secondary factor of human healthcare resources being disproportionately affected by covid-19 themselves further reducing that capacity, etc.)"
7841,"That said, looking at this purely as a statistics and mathematical simulation / prediction / model my sense is that we will find myriad factors impacting the overall number in both directions."
7842,"Some examples of likely drivers:
++++ Covid and related symptoms
+ Delayed diagnosis of likely treatable diseases and more severe outcomes (e.g."
7843,"diabetes, certain very treatable cancers, others)
0 Delayed diagnosis of less treatable diseases (e.g."
7844,"low survivability cancers)
- Reduced rates of complications from other infectious disease (e.g."
7845,"flu)
- Reduced rates of injury related deaths due to decreased driving, commuting, work activities, etc."
7846,It's important to look at these as a mathematical model to appreciate the complexity in the totality.
7847,"You have to look not just at preventable disease with severe outcomes, but also the probability against the baseline of people taking the steps to get the early diagnosis without covid as an additional inhibitor."
7848,For example I would expect that people with low grade or no health insurance would be equally unlikely to get early detection.
7849,"One could actually test, if some of those might get better detection where there is symptom overlap between covid and the diseases leading to more available medical resources and awareness (e.g."
7850,"lung cancer), although it would be equally interesting to test if earlier detection would lead to better treatment and outcomes given the non-covid inhibitors."
7851,"Finally, for the truly inquisitive, I have an interesting question I'm thinking about in this space: what is the mental health impact of covid and how does it affect overall population health, etc."
7852,"For example, more people are working from home and spending more time with family, this should have a positive impact on their mental health, development of their children, closeness as a family, etc."
7853,"At the same time, layoffs, changes, children doing school from home, both spouses or roommates all working from one space all could induce more stress."
7854,We could add more factors here.
7855,When I can find some time I might dig into this a bit.
7856,"It‚Äôs because the virus isn‚Äôt that bad, if it isn‚Äôt going to kill somebody as allegedly unhealthy as him ü§∑üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

I can tell you‚Äôre very upset about this."
7857,Can't go wrong with hot spuds
7858,I guess beer and cheese do not add to intelligence.
7859,We had it too good for too long.
7860,People can't seem to grasp that life the way they lived it isn't guaranteed.
7861,Pandemics happen.
7862,They've happened all throughout history.
7863,"Yet, people still call it a hoax, or want everything to go back to normal."
7864,They want their freedom.
7865,Did we feel gratitude in that moment of sunbathing?
7866,"Thinking that 100 years ago, people were dying of many viruses?"
7867,"The most ironic thing is that countries have gotten on top of COVID-19, and those who haven't are telling everyone it will be around forever."
7868,"If you don't put in the work, then it probably will."
7869,COVID doesn't give a shit when you stop treating it like a pandemic.
7870,Like a tidal wave doesn't care when you stop treating it like one.
7871,Or a bushfire doesn't care if you want to ignore it.
7872,Ignore it at your peril.
7873,I kind of like fireball.

7908,I was talking to a doctor in my hospital and tellling him I wasn‚Äôt worried because I‚Äôm young and healthy and the odds of anything serious happening to me are so slim that I feel comfortable.

8098,*Weeps in Texan.
8099,"*

I was able to early vote at a very slow time, so I can't complain."
8100,"It chills my blood to think about the lines on election day, though."
8101,basically yep.
8102,"pulling our scientists out of china last year hurt, not locking down flights in january hurt, but i can't really blame the politicians at that point."
8103,"by the time we hit march it was clear that a short term, high intensity lockdown could have solved most of our problems."
8104,i blame those politicians for most of the deaths since then
8105,"Yeah, a friend of mine in the supply chain has said theyve ramped up capacity."
8106,"It just took time, they weren't expecting people to horde like they did when this all started."
8107,WFH situation in my area hasn't changed at all and most goods are in stock every day now.
8108,My friend is banging prostitutes in Arizona and is coming to visit.
8109,When I asked if he can get a tested before visiting he told me ‚ÄúI wear a mask and use hand sanitizer!
8110,What else do you want from me?
8111,!‚Äù
8112,I know youre being crass but there are a lot of good ppl in Texas.
8113,I suggest not throwing the baby with the bathwater.
8114,Sorry but one has nothing to do with the other.
8115,"I thought you were done, that's the only thing I'm confused about here üòä"
8116,That still would have required real strategic federal deployment of testing and actual contact tracing.
8117,We never had a chance with this administration.
8118,[removed]
8119,"The term ""herd immunity"" has been around for almost a century, and it was first applied to humans (with measles)."
8120,This has nothing to do cattle.
8121,And it is nowhere near finished with us...
8122,"David Carradine‚Äôs last words:

‚ÄúOh God I‚Äôm coming!‚Äù"
8123,I mean are you a local to his area in Minnesota?
8124,The news frankly can't cover everything Covid related.
8125,"Hmmm I don't remember businesses being closed, indoor dining banned, and 80% mask usage during the h1n1 pandemic, do you?"
8126,I don't doubt that one bit.
8127,But I think you can understand something will be done if (it's an if) COVID blows up again.
8128,What if we're inside the apartment and have then built it outside the door like they usually do here?
8129,And with what should we wipe it down?
8130,For REAL.
8131,"Take a look at r/covidlonghaulers if you want to know why this isn't just ""the flu"" and see how it can have many longterm effects, even for people who were asymptomatic or had mild cases."
8132,^^^^^ And this is why we still have a covid problem.
8133,I mean a hoax...sorry.
8134,Idk what Q is on about today.
8135,Some other person desperate for a job.
8136,"No, I believe as most people understand that both 0.02% and 0.003% are both small numbers."
8137,So aren't we talking about it getting out of control again?
8138,"Or is this ""highest numbers since August"" just media hype?"
8139,What does people exhaling have to do with it?
8140,I already explained the way the air is turned over.
8141,If you are primarily breathing in filtered clean air from the ventilation system you are not breathing in your neighbors exhalations.
8142,I fly every week and I get about 1 cold per year.
8143,Same with my other coworkers.
8144,"The ones, at our company, that get sick more often are the office workers."
8145,Dont downvote.
8146,It's a fair question.
8147,Texas is a right to work state.
8148,That basically means your rights as a worker are pretty much gone.
8149,The rights are default to the employers.
8150,"Being unable to breathe, but also aware of it?"
8151,"Sounds like a ""good time"" to me."
8152,They won't listen to that tho.
8153,Only option is having it built by someone
8154,There were reportedly problems with the data that AZ was sending to the FDA due to file formatting differences in the UK and the US regulators.
8155,God it‚Äôs depressing.
8156,The south is the worst for this.

8158,Not a Historian but have a BA in History and I‚Äôve always found historical demography interesting.
8159,Nothing seems super off in the article but.
8160,However also when dealing with numbers from before the 19th century a mountain of salt is needed.
8161,"5,000,000 died in the Antontiane plague in the 160s Roman Empire- possible."
8162,However the Romans didn‚Äôt keep track of every person who died- no pre-modern state did (or even had the ability).
8163,In addition disease was so common in pre-modern times it was basically a constant state of pandemic.
8164,In Ancient Rome the rich lived on hills to avoid malaria.
8165,(Mosquitos lived in the valleys were the water drained to).
8166,For the poor in Ancient Rome it was basically a constant pandemic.
8167,(Urban areas were always centers of disease in pre-modern times).
8168,Equalivlents existed elsewhere across the pre-modern world.
8169,COVID-19 is the worse pandemic since the Spanish Flu- but would have par for the course for most of human history.
8170,"I know, but they aren't budging."
8171,They think I will end up wasting their money if I can't make it work
8172,Yes!
8173,I like this tradition better.
8174,:)
8175,The Rt of influenza and COVID aren't too far off.
8176,The same in a lot of states.
8177,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3084966/
8178,So now you're the one acting like you know better than the experts who make these estimates.
8179,Global restrictions have never occurred on this scale before and we have a way better understanding of hygiene / disease transmission now in 2020 than we did even 50 years ago.
8180,If we shut down like this every year for the flu it would be gone.
8181,Do you have a better explanation?
8182,Dick-nosing your mask is the idiots comprimise between total freedom and slight inconvenience.
8183,And to top it off they look stupid.
8184,The entire country should be doing like NYC and publicly shaming people.
8185,"Suddenly its wear a mask or be a viral sensation, people arent going to want to deal with all that."
8186,Kind of silly that anything ever opened up.
8187,The US has never had this under control.
8188,Its also a lot around this bullshit hoax myth.
8189,"If trump had any semblance of leadership he‚Äôd be comboning with democrats to get t message across that rhe virus is real, its deadly, and small actions now will prevent big actions later."
8190,Instead hes taking his perceived politicalt expedient route which is to barely acknowledge its real and consistently downplay the severity.
8191,Regardless of your political leanings you really have to acknowledge the lack of leadership in this respect.
8192,Great I‚Äôm glad we cleared that up.
8193,Asinine restrictions cannot be allowed to happen again
8194,"We could had shutdown in June or july, for 5 weeks."
8195,"Had people stock up on food, have the army deliver MRE's to people who couldn't afford 5 weeks worth of food."
8196,"Give every adult 5k for those 5 weeks and we could had done what New Zealand did and got rid of all community spread, and get rid of the virus."
8197,But nope.
8198,Just a slow death spiral that is 100% costing more economically than what I just suggested.
8199,San Angelo?
8200,Give it time.
8201,The ICU was maxed out during the first wave.
8202,This one will be worse.
8203,"You forgot all those cruises being the center of epidemic spreads in early Feb. For example, Diamond Princess has 22kn cruise speed."
8204,"For comparison, RMS Titanic had 21kn cruise speed and 23kn max."
8205,"Shoot, every veteran knows that."
8206,The government doesnt care about you unless it's for taxes or youre a threat to the status quo.
8207,Kinda.
8208,"The general rule is if you are unable to remove the mask on your own, you shouldn't be wearing one."
8209,nice
8210,What... theres literally half a dozen late stage vaccine candidates; covid wont end the world why are you being so idiotic
8211,"On the bright side, if the winter is a catastrophe, we may be much closer to herd immunity come spring."
8212,I guess im glad one very narrow perspective in one ambiguous city in one state is doing ok?
8213,I was completely polite with you and you got catty and rude.
8214,It's telling.
8215,Confusion leads to anger.
8216,How do the people downvoting you think a lockdown happens?
8217,"There isn't a lockdown until politicians agree to one, and if they never do there's no lockdown."
8218,"They won't, and there won't be."
8219,is there a place we can cross over undetected..
8220,"I don't mind hiking or swimming..

i'll totally quarantine for 2 weeks.."
8221,"With all those eyes watching, I son't think we can fake the number even if we want to."
8222,"i think they mean the word, not the concept"
8223,Ew!
8224,I can just imagine her incredulous reaction.
8225,"This is where I embarrassingly admit I only read the first part and didn't make it that far, but happened to know this anyway"
8226,How would there be a bias toward them if we don't have confirmation of the first infection in order to determine that they were infected a second time?
8227,If it's any consolation I'm in the mid atlantic and things are great here.
8228,"On my towns facebook page some look was selling ""send our kids back to school"" yard signs and people have started coming up with legal reasons why you can't be fined for not wearing a mask."
8229,We will be with you shortly
8230,"Among all developed countries, the US has probably most aggressive about keeping kids out of schools."
8231,And in virtually every measurable way the US response to COVID has been a disaster.
8232,"Though it surprises Americans, few other developed countries show as little regard for children's right or well-being at the US."
8233,You shouldn't assume that Ireland does this just because they're stupid.
8234,It also has to do with the fact that they simply care more about kids than the US.
8235,"I get there are parents who are really concerned about their kids falling behind in education and feel that online classes are insufficient, but I can't imagine a universe where a tactic like this wouldn't be even more distracting and detrimental."
8236,You triggered a brain cell.
8237,I need some Binaca!
8238,My hometown is in NW Ohio and my parents are regularly going to bars and restaurants unmasked.
8239,Their carelessness drives me crazy.
8240,I think they aren‚Äôt taking it seriously because they don‚Äôt personally know anyone who has been seriously affected health-wise.
8241,It is totally a bubble.
8242,"With all the spread in their county now, I‚Äôm worried that reality will come crashing down on them soon."
8243,Let me repeat myself for those of you who were not paying attention.
8244,-OP
8245,Seems to be more like 13th deadliest pandemic^(for white people)
8246,The media was alarmist over the false threat of terrorism for the last decade.
8247,Now that there is a real threat noone takes them seriously.

8257,Wait until after Thanksgiving and Christmas
8258,"So you're telling me that decades of research was wrong, millions of people died from the flu and it could have stopped this fast?"
8259,If it is twice as deadly how is it the flu has been completely wiped out globally but COVID keeps growing?
8260,Come on.

8262,"I‚Äôm not religious but what you‚Äôre referring too actually has an answer ‚Äòthe necessary evil‚Äô, in most religions for every good action there must be a bad one, thus explaining why a ‚ÄòGod‚Äô would create a pandemic."
8263,I don‚Äôt have faith in anything but you could at least be respectful
8264,"It seemed more like Labor Day to me, that was 10-14 days later I think"
8265,"The ironic thing is that it's a great lesson

You don't do the protocols you'll be fine as long as you have 200k for private hospitalization, 24/7 monitoring, and experimental treatments."
8266,"Oh, you don't have that?"
8267,Then put on a $1 mask
8268,"Urgent cares are also usually mostly staffed by medical assistants and x-ray techs, people who haven't had nearly as much education and training on infection prevention as licensed nurses."
8269,I'd know.
8270,"I am the only licensed nurse among all clinical staff at my 24/7 urgent care clinic here in Orlando, FL."
8271,"N95s are reserved for providers (APRNs, PAs, MDs, and DOs)."
8272,Regular clinical staff are only provided surgical masks and face shields or goggles.
8273,"Patients are allowed to make *doctor* appointments every 5 minutes to be tested **as well as** walk in to be tested, which again, is a doctor's visit."
8274,"Between midnight and 0700, there is only me, my partner who's an x-ray tech, and a nurse practitioner who also has to handle online visits."
8275,"It's been a fucking nightmare and with flu season underway, we're getting fucked in the ass."
8276,I know you've been waiting for more than 4 hours.
8277,I know you had an appointment.
8278,I have no control over that.
8279,Be kind to the people who you interact with when you walk into our urgent care clinic.
8280,We are facing this war head on.
8281,"However, unlike the military we aren't subsidized by the government."
8282,"Instead, we are constantly being undermined by it."
8283,We must answer to the corporations who employ us instead of protecting and serving the patients under our care.
8284,So well said.
8285,I chuckled at \*full start\*.
8286,"Makes me wonder how this will affect the spread of Covid, because the south is the region with the most cases and the north is region with not as many cases, especially in Washington."
8287,So a slowly moving tsunami.
8288,I know.
8289,This is horrible.
8290,Anglophilia?
8291,Many Americans have an inferiority complex toward the U.K.
8292,"you forgot to end that with ""so far"""

8316,"Regardless, I don‚Äôt see that people are going to keep pushing back their weddings, proms and graduations."
8317,What a childish take.
8318,Please see Vietnam Australia and New Zealand
8319,Lots of countries use masks yes.
8320,They aren‚Äôt mandated by the state.
8321,"Yes, in Japan the public wears masks during flu season if/when they‚Äôre sick and need to go to the store to get NyQuil."
8322,They don‚Äôt wear them every time they leave the house.
8323,In addition - masks with no distancing requirements doesn‚Äôt bug me as much.
8324,Telling me I can‚Äôt have 100 people at my wedding with no dancing is something I can‚Äôt get behind - I‚Äôd rather take a few years off the average life expectancy than live life this way.
8325,"I'm sorry if this sounds stupid, but when I look up the definition of an incubation period, it says the period in between the time you are exposed and when you show symptoms."
8326,"But, I've also heard many people say that you need to wait 14 days from the incident itself to make sure you are not positive for Covid."
8327,Wouldn't it still be in your system much earlier and be detectable by a test even if you don't show symptoms?
8328,"I hope this becomes mainstream, my brother in law has it and about 6 us were with him 3 weeks ago and he had it but we all came back negative."
8329,Even my sister in law (his wife) didn‚Äôt get it
8330,I find it concerning that you think two is a lot.
8331,"Can we get a separate flair on posts to say ""Florida"" rather than ""USA""?"
8332,Florida is a disaster of a state and it seems like half the egregious posts here are about them.
8333,Don't tell Trump.
8334,We have mandatory masks but if there is no one to enforce it most of the time...
8335,iirc it was an equine virus....
8336,"yeah, also in the places where people eat bats, bats tend to be much larger than the bats we see in Europe and America."
8337,an Australian flying fox fruit bat is a more credible meal than the tiny insectivore bats we're used to.
8338,and the 1918 pandemic was probably a swine flu initially.
8339,Americans didn't stop eating pork.
8340,"Again, it could be the placebo."
8341,It‚Äôs literally in the title.
8342,"South Korea is a prime example: https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2020/08/200820102431.htm

* Total Cases: 25k (scaled to USA, 160k."
8343,"USA: 8.5m)
* Total Deaths: 450 (scaled to USA, just under 3k)."
8344,"Compared to the USA, the population density of South Korea should make it much, much harder to manage there."

8347,"I keep thinking about the nurse featured on CNN spent months in the hospital, unable to see her family."
8348,"She'll likely live, but lost both her hands to complications of being in the hospital itself."

8350,UPDATE: He received a placebo.
8351,Oxford university said there was no safety concern about the trial.
8352,Yeah there is this strange rhetoric of ‚Äúdefeat coronavirus‚Äù without any definition of what that means.
8353,Or teacher unions saying no in person classes until their are zero cases.
8354,People need to start actually asking what the goal is.
8355,"Because to be quite frank, people are not going to keep putting off weddings, or proms, or graduations."
8356,Finally I see what I have mentioned somewhere.

8374,I‚Äôm listening to scientists and evidence.
8375,It‚Äôs hilarious that you would refuse to throw murderers in prison.
8376,Most experts seem to think that it will be available to the general public mid 2021.
8377,Health care workers (and then the most vulnerable) will have access earlier.
8378,I‚Äòm hoping in time for the later wine fests and Oktoberfest.
8379,The question is: is this a minor global pandemic?
8380,What graph?
8381,The point you make is obvious about cases and deaths during the first lockdown.
8382,I don't think you've read the context of my post properly.
8383,It's both.
8384,But without placebos everyone...doctor and patients...knows what's what.
8385,And it's important neither know.
8386,"You're right, of course."
8387,I failed to express myself clearly.
8388,Thanks!
8389,I've always been a bit confused by that verse.
8390,It seems like it is similar to the one about not sinning just to make God's grace the greater.
8391,Rut roh
8392,Well at least some regions are starting the curfews and limiting schools
8393,I'm not arguing with you.
8394,Arguing with you gives your point validity it does not deserve.
8395,I'm just pointing out that you're complicit in the downfall of our country through your inability to understand that science is always going to be more accurate than your 'gut feeling'.
8396,"Get with the times or go back to living in a cave, because the rest of us are more than happy to move on without you."
8397,But otherwise naked is still okay though?
8398,Likely have already passed it with high confidence.
8399,&gt; normality won't come back according to you?
8400,Normality is changing all the time.
8401,Oil lamps used to be the norm.
8402,White men as the only land owners used to be the norm.
8403,A large portion of the population dying or having their lives ruined by polio used to be the norm.

8414,"We stopped wearing masks after the 1918 pandemic ended, and this is no different."
8415,Lots of countries have regular mask usage throughout the year prior to this outbreak.
8416,I don't know why some people are so dramatic about them.
8417,They're a minor inconvenience at worst.
8418,"That said, we have no idea how long social distancing and mask usage will go on as it's a function of how many people are sick first and foremost, not the release date of a vaccine."
8419,Humans and human tendencies evolve very slowly.
8420,COVID-19 denialism is just like the Spanish Flu denialism.
8421,You can easily draw parallels here because irrationality is in our human nature.
8422,We will simply never learn.
8423,It's the same shit all over again.
8424,"Meanwhile, our school district in North Dakota sent out an email last night that basically said, ‚ÄúWe know we said we‚Äôd go all-remote learning if our county reached red status, and our county has reached red status, but‚Ä¶ We‚Äôre not going to go all-remote just yet because that would be too disruptive.‚Äù"

8428,Ahh the simplest answer to a spreading virus.
8429,‚ÄúIt‚Äôs because people aren‚Äôt wearing their masks!!!
8430,"üò°üò°üò°‚Äù

Masks are one part of the solution."
8431,One tiny part.
8432,100% mask compliance would do little to curb spread as evidenced by many jurisdictions.
8433,Death is not the worst outcome from this virus.
8434,It will for me and pretty much everyone I know.
8435,You can‚Äôt torture people like this forever
8436,"Can't force you now, it's personal responsibility"
8437,they are doing it to save us Canucks from their own spread ... right?
8438,"no one should be fking travelling right now (for leisure -- some can't avoid due to visa issues, etc)"
8439,"^^ this guy - ‚ÄúIm openly against a well enforced two-to-four-week long lockdown that will drastically reduce cases and likely put COVID behind us at least for a long while, returning us to normal, because I far prefer my economy to putter along severely crippled all while killing the elderly and vulnerable instead‚Äù"
8440,We understand the flu from decades of research.
8441,Are you comparing our understanding of COVID &amp; it's long term effects to our understanding of the flu?
8442,"If so, that's a foolish decision."
8443,That‚Äôs what I‚Äôve been saying and been getting downvoted for.
8444,"In the most optimistic situation, we get a vaccine that‚Äôs 70% effective and 50% of the population gets the full protection of the vaccine."
8445,That‚Äôs leaves 35% of the population immune but that‚Äôs not enough to prevent community spread through herd immunity.
8446,This is going to last for years and become endemic.
8447,"The sooner we accept that and stop pretending it‚Äôll magically go away by next fall, the sooner we can actually beat the virus to the point that it can be tracked, traced, and outbreaks isolated."
8448,"shut up, Dr. Billy"

8453,"Pls show me a source that backs this up, I don't need assumptions."
8454,That‚Äôs true for sure.
8455,Where I disagree is the time part.
8456,"I‚Äôve said on this sub that I believe 100,000 deaths/year is probably around the mark where people in the US are comfortable."
8457,Could be more or less.
8458,"I also don‚Äôt think long-term effects, unless they are HIGHLY likely, are going to move the needle on risk tolerance too much for full reopening."
8459,"I think that, with the robust immune response these trials have shown, there‚Äôs a solid chance that one of the vaccines has, say, a 60% effective rate but in the 40% that can still actually get it, it would be less severe because their bodies will be well-equipped to mount a quicker immune response... in other words, it won‚Äôt be ‚Äúnovel‚Äù anymore for the vaccinated."
8460,Couple that with the fact that CFR (not IFR) seems to have dropped significantly since the early days with some decent treatment opens and more knowledge.
8461,"With this in mind, I suspect you see, within a couple months of vaccinating the vulnerable, a big drop in deaths in that group."
8462,"Since they really are the only group where getting it is outside your average person‚Äôs risk tolerance, this should paint a clear picture pretty quickly that it is time to reassess in a big way."
8463,My biggest concern is that honest discussion not happening.
8464,I hope that after the election the political vitriol fades away to an extent and real stuff like that can be discussed and planned.

8471,"Couldn‚Äôt be further from the truth, and a simple look a graph would explain it to you."
8472,Lockdowns were put in place to reduce the totally out of control spread and they worked wonderfully.
8473,"If there was no initial lockdown, cases and deaths would not have stopped like they did."
8474,Vaccine may never come too.
8475,Where is vaccine against HIV?
8476,It's been 40 years already
8477,There is zero incentive today to produce a SARS vaccine.
8478,"This one, on the other hand..."
8479,"If you want to wear one, cool."
8480,But you cannot force me or other people to wear one after covid becomes endemic.
8481,Don't be selfish.
8482,"Wear a mask, and if it helps, look in the mirror while wearing it.... As long as you're not a vampire, that is"
8483,"Dude, come on man."
8484,Personally attacking me for trying to understand what other people are thinking and how they are trying to cope is counter productive at best.
8485,"The countries that implemented harsh lockdowns have things like tiny homogenous populations, that can also easily isolate from the rest of the world like NZ, or they are places like China where they have been manipulating data for decades, so their numbers are not trustworthy...

For too long too many people have treated science like a religion scientists do not know everything and they are doing their best to get to a solution."

8488,no

8490,A year is a long time.

8492,No one knows what October 2021 will look like.
8493,"I'm optimistic by the time a vaccine is widely available, enough people will take it and it will be effective enough to keep the infection rate from going out of control."
8494,And a slowly declining infection rate (which continues to decline as more people get vaccinated and the virus has less hosts) is likely the best possible outcome.
8495,"You're going to see masks and distancing slowly be removed from everyday life somewhere along that timeframe, mid-2021, regardless of what experts say."
8496,"Now, if that just results in more people being infected, then sure, it's all for naught."
8497,"Those people still have to go to work &amp; to the grocery store, so they have to rely on the community to not be selfish &amp; ignorant."
8498,"40% of the U.S. doesn't wear a mask, inside or out."

Unofficial reports state that he received placebo and not the vaccine."
8507,I‚Äôm not certain this is correct.
8508,I think what makes it a double blind is that not even the doctor giving the shot knows if the patient receives the vaccine or the placebo so that they don‚Äôt treat the patient any differently.
8509,"Oh, I'm more than certain enough early vaccine recipients will ignore the risk, or accept it."
8510,Plus...look at healthcare workers.
8511,"They're catching it now in spite of every precaution they can take, and they'll be first in line for the vaccine."
8512,"So we'll have a sufficient pool of vaccinated, exposed subjects to study."

8532,Only some vaccines induce a strong enough of an immune response to prevent carriage and transmission of a pathogen.

&gt;A new report from The Daily Beast suggests Disney World is underreporting COVID-19 cases"
8576,You should perhaps read the article.
8577,We might get a vaccine that's 50% effective.
8578,That's within the bounds of what can be licensed.
8579,"But that's well short of the 70% or so needed for herd immunity, even if *everyone* gets it."
8580,And vaccinated people might just turn into asymptomatic carriers instead.
8581,I do wonder if multiple vaccines would be multiplicative.
8582,Would 2 barely adequate ones add up to 75% effectiveness?
8583,That makes sense.
8584,But my point really is that we don‚Äôt know what the IFR was from the beginning since we probably missed 90-95% of all cases.
8585,WHO has estimated that up to 10% of the world‚Äôs population has been infected.
8586,That‚Äôs like 760 million actual cases.
8587,"With 1 million deaths, or say 2 million if we missed 50% of all deaths, we are not seeing a 0.7% IFR, but much, much lower."
8588,"So, I think it‚Äôs way too early to say that we have substantially lowered the IFR through therapeutics."

9055,"I asked him why he's being retarded and he just replied ""what?"
9056,"I can't sneeze in the mask"""
9057,At this point nobody is going to change their mind unless they are personally affected.
9058,We are such a shithole country.
9059,Bad choice of words on my part.
9060,"The R0 of SARS-COV-19 is about the same as SARS-1, the big difference is you weren't contagious until you were symptomatic and the symptoms were very visible."
9061,1400 of the 1600 deaths have been 60+.
9062,Nearly 60% of the deaths countrywide have been in nursing homes.
9063,It absolutely discriminates based on age.
9064,Wisconsin is essentially an alcoholic culture.
9065,"I remember opening up the local paper after moving away, and it was full of ads for drinking cheap at bars."
9066,It made me feel sick to my stomach.

9074,This is interesting because you're the first small business owner I've spoken to who is in favor of an aggressive lockdown.
9075,Would you be willing to sacrifice your small business for the lockdown?
9076,"&gt;I thought it was a joke

This is a lie they tell themselves to excuse their selfishness and willful ignorance."
9077,Not necessarily.
9078,"If they're asymptomatic the second time around, for example, you may never even know."
9079,The bias is always going to be that we're going to notice the worse illnesses.
9080,"Also, we have to rule out relapses and post viral syndromes before reinfections, which makes this trickier to navigate."
9081,"What amazes me is this is what was happening in NY and NJ, yet no one learned from them?"
9082,Nope not a one.
9083,"How many extra suicides do you think there are, and what source are you basing that on?"
9084,"Nah, they're just imitating Trump."
9085,"Trump was only in the hospital for three days, that should be enough for everyone to get better and stop being contagious, right?"
9086,"&amp;#x200B;

So glad the president is setting such a good example for the nation."
9087,God I can't wait until he loses the election.
9088,"Yup, if these people want ""freedom"" and any semblance of normal life, then full compliance with wearing masks and basic social distancing is the best way to ensure it."
9089,Otherwise we'll have no choice but to hard-lockdown again and again when it inevitably spirals out of control and causes thousands and thousands of deaths every single day.
9090,Why is this so hard for people to understand?
9091,Hard-lockdown enact a huge socioeconomic toll on society.
9092,I'd like to avoid that again.

9095,"Gee...how about, you know, encouraging young people to ONLY socialize with other young people?"
9096,My local schools and businesses are still not open at 100% school buildings closed until januaryish.
9097,What is open depends kn the location.
9098,Fauci is speaking to a nation -not just your local area.
9099,"And just because they are open, doesn't mean its a great idea."
9100,"You clearly aren't even trying to understand my point, so I'll leave you to it then."
9101,"Sorry, maybe it took 30 days in the 1800s and 5 days in the early 1900s, idk."
9102,But I think it also depended on the ship.
9103,My understanding is that the Titanic was relatively new.
9104,"As someone who lives in WI, I can tell you right now... Outside of Milwaukee and Madison (and a couple random places) nobody in this state gives a fuck about COVID."
9105,Our fucking state legislature hasn't had a session since April yet they've sued the governor twice over his attempts to do something.

9113,"&gt; So I think there is more to it than just closing elementary school, pubs, gyms, hair dressers, libraries and borders."
9114,"You do realize that closing public utilities is the strictest form of enforcing social distancing guidelines nationwide, right?"
9115,And that doing so prevents most of the reasons on your list from becoming vectors?
9116,How is this turned around on me lol.
9117,I‚Äôm the one saying we shouldn‚Äôt have a free for all with Covid restrictions just like we don‚Äôt have a free for all with driving.
9118,Don‚Äôt put words into my mouth.
9119,Yeah.
9120,Seems a bit spurious to compare modern masks with what they had available in 1919.
9121,Multiple layered/N95 masks versus... prettymuch a handkerchief?
9122,We will probably have yearly corona vaccinations for risk groups like we have with the flu if it mutates too fast.
9123,Agree completely.
9124,They literally can't leave their homes except for food or medicines.
9125,Were more jobs somehow created?
9126,I'm confused by your answer.
9127,I assume their are less jobs and less ppl working as seems to be the case in lockdown countries.
9128,Isn't it a socialist country?
9129,Why aren't the poor being taken care of?
9130,Huh.
9131,"I did notice we didn‚Äôt report over the weekend, so maybe 4.5k was a backlog."
9132,I sure hope so.
9133,"Considering it‚Äôs only Tuesday, I‚Äôd rather not break 5k this week."
9134,"But we‚Äôve been nearly doubling by the week, so I dunno."
9135,"If they had the internet back then, would have loved to get in on some of those #1918 memes."
9136,What a fucked up year THAT was.
9137,COVID would have been the 3rd worst pandemic that year!!!
9138,!
9139,"I hope god, who ever that might be judges these ass hole in the end!"
9140,"It's honestly shocking that anyone, at any point in time, fully expected this to 'go away'."
9141,The flu is around every year but we live with it.
9142,We manage it.
9143,We vaccinate for it.
9144,We treat for it.
9145,And we go about our lives.
9146,"This will, eventually, be no different."
9147,Just to put in a dash of optimism.
9148,HIV is a far deadlier and tricky virus and at the very least we managed to tame it with an antiviral cocktail and as of right now we may be on track to develop a treatment that could eliminate it entirely.
9149,Granted this is decades of research coming to a head but the commitment to COVID dwarfs these efforts immediately.
9150,I don‚Äôt know when but I‚Äôm confident we‚Äôll have something that will render this virus a nuisance at worst.
9151,As for vaccines it‚Äôs my understand HPV is a virus that reinfects as well.
9152,The vaccine we eventually made ended up making focused on a specific part of the virus to combat what it used to duck our immune system.
9153,This current batch of vaccines may not be a magic bullet and only marginally effective for all we know the next generation may be a game changer.
9154,I‚Äôm not afraid of this virus long term.
9155,Scientific innovation will succeed.
9156,I‚Äôm more afraid of the immediate future where countless end up dying when they don‚Äôt have to.
9157,"This was the case with Ebola killing its host, and then why it was considered eradicated (until it wasn't) but we're not worried about catching Ebola, today."
9158,Wut.
9159,Have you been to the subreddit?
9160,"Actually stay away, plenty of you infecting it already"
9161,Heart disease could be covid could be waiting too long to go to the hospital for fear of the virus.
9162,Will be years to tease out.
9163,The cancer deaths are on the state governments though.
9164,"I don‚Äôt know who thought cancer treatments weren‚Äôt essential, but they never should have denied people their appointments and treatment."
9165,That was the original point of everyone staying home so people who had to go out could do it safely.
9166,I get that chemo kills the immune system and the fear is they could die of Covid then but if they definitely have cancer and only might get covid it seems like you treat the one they have.
9167,feel ya.
9168,"im a home health aide, but albeit only slightly apart of the healthcare system.. i dont interact with the general public in this way.. only one one care."
9169,id be very scared if i did.
9170,shit idk if i would stay at the job.
9171,but if one of my patients is showing covid symptoms not only does the patient take a test but we also dont have to show up if we feel we are at risk.
9172,i dont mind working with a patient who is suspected of covid though.
9173,bc if i dont show up .. they go without care which isnt fair to them or their families at all.
9174,and imo taking care of sick people with a possibility of being around a contagious disease is my job.. its what i signed up for.

9184,&gt; The paper is not predictive.
9185,"Instead, Shaman and Galanti identify the key factors in determining the trajectory of COVID-19, namely, the likelihood of reinfection, the effectiveness of a vaccine, the seasonality of the virus, and whether significant numbers of people will contract COVID-19 along with another virus like influenza."
9186,If you learn React first I'm not sure even vanilla JS would make much sense to you.
9187,Can someone help me out because I‚Äôm confused.
9188,"Fauci said a few days ago that there should be enough vaccines for everyone in April 2021, most likely meaning everyone who wants to be vaccinated will be by May 2021."
9189,From what I read this article states that vaccines will BEGIN in the middle of 2021?
9190,I don‚Äôt know if I‚Äôm reading these articles wrong or if I‚Äôm missing something.
9191,Can someone clear this up for me?
9192,Ok?
9193,And?

9197,No.

9210,Queensland is doing spectacularly.

9232,If we're attempting to save money from health related negligence then my suggestion is even more relevant and fruitful than denying anti-maskers.

9242,"It will suck for us, for our kids, likely for many generations until eventually (and if other medicines don't continuously hamper this progress) all weaker genomes are flushed out of existence."
9243,The simple fact we have medical intervention leads me to believe we'll continue to pass on some of the weaker folk either way.
9244,Just got to make it long enough to breed which is a pretty low bar in this day and age of other advanced medicine.
9245,Yeah and there are a ton of laws related to driving - like you must have a license.
9246,And you must obey the speed limit.
9247,And drive in lanes.
9248,And have insurance.

9259,"They will definitely know which strain has been circulating, testing has been ramped up significantly."
9260,It's highly unlikely for a strain to go for a long time undetected.
9261,No they‚Äôre afraid because we have 40k cases and 1k deaths a freaking day.

9290,The utility of this definition lies in establishing what is possible as we learn how the virus behaves.
9291,"But in the months ahead, as more people report a second bout of illness, this rigorous definition might become less useful."
9292,The proof will be in the pudding.
9293,realistic target is probably lower number of hospitalizations than an average flu season.

9405,I'm not keen on comparing war deaths to disease deaths anyway.
9406,But comparing war deaths in one country (Vietnam) with disease deaths in another (USA) is vaguely justifiable.

9416,Not that i ever would but what if we hypothetically just shot everyone without a mask?
9417,Dear god the economic misery alone would probably outweigh the potential risks of the virus.
9418,I hypothesized this over a month ago and was met with ridicule and downvotes.
9419,"Firstly, I doubt we will ever hit herd immunity."
9420,We never hit herd immunity for all of the diseases that humans had been living with for hundreds or thousands of years before vaccines.
9421,"but more importantly, I would bet money that Covid-19 has a 2-4 year immunity."
9422,SARS immunity lasts about 3 years.
9423,Other SARS type viruses also have an immunity of 2-4 years.
9424,There are already multiple strains of Covid-19 that people can be infected with multiple time.
9425,"Covid-19 seems to mutate pretty rapidly and reinfect us easily, which makes me hypothesize..."
9426,THIS IS A HUGE HYPOTHESIS: I wouldn't be surprised if the eventual vaccine for Covid-19 ends up something akin to a flu vaccine.
9427,"We have to take it once a year or once ever 2 or 3 or 4 years, and it will have a 50%-80% effectiveness depending on which strain of Covid-19 is coming through this year."

9442,You'll be better off catching the virus in 6 months than now.
9443,&gt;But what if that doesn‚Äôt happen for many years?
9444,There are dozens of vaccines in the works.

9457,"Yes, its miserable af but we kinda fixed the problem."
9458,You just gotta look at the US to see what it couldve been...
9459,they only just started ad campaigns?
9460,or is it just a new one?
9461,my state in aus still has tv/radio/shopping centre ad campaigns going and we've been covid free for 5\~ months aside from a few international imported cases of like 20\~ over the past 4 months
9462,Not sure if that‚Äôs how disease control works though.

9481,"It's 8 months now, nobody is even close to catching up."
9482,Nobody seriously believe they will catch up.
9483,Sweden just failed completely because they were too lazy to do the right thing.
9484,What data are you even looking at?
9485,"Sweden's daily fatalities are at the floor, and CFR is below that of several other western countries."
9486,"You make many assumptions in your ""analysis""."
9487,To think the US is on their third wave while most countries are lagging behind on their second wave.
9488,Given the recent studies the only viable solution to prevent covid ist to implement a strict system like China.
9489,"&amp;#x200B;

China managed to reduce to contact point time (time betweend person B receives notices that person A has covid-19) from 7,5 days to 1,5 days."
9490,"All other countries are &gt;7days, if ever."
9491,Their contact tracing is really on-top of everythin.
9492,If you had contact with someone who has covid-19 you usual receive within 1-2 days a message that you have to quarantine yourself.
9493,"With ther constant screening of movements (cameras, smartphones) it's easy to control if you quarantine or if you move around."
9494,"Furthermore, whenever a there is a small cluster of covid-cases the whole district/ city has to do a covid-19 test within a couple of days, mandatory."
9495,This is the only feasbile soluion to prevent mass infection.
9496,Their economy is now back to pre-covid level in term of travelling and production.
9497,"Looking at WW2, USA was the first country to heal from the devestation and start their economy back up again."
9498,This head-start is so important.
9499,I think we are living in a change of world power atm.
9500,2020 will enter the history books as the time when the world power shifted and China picked up speed 1-2 years faster than the rest of the world.
9501,"Our government is doing everything opposite of what works: Non-mandatory covid-19 tracing apps that nobody uses, Non-manatory tests of cities, lock-down of stores and restaurants so that all people meet inside at somebody home with far less personal distance."
9502,"Umm, 200k is SUPER low."

9511,American medicine really is absurd.
9512,"The whole system needs to be reworked from the ground up, including the cost of medical education so that doctors don't need to pay off half a million in student debt."

9515,"It's worth talking about how the future looks but why is this a ""may""?"

9536,who is suprised?
9537,it's going to be much higjer over the next weeks.
9538,if you see a peak at the cases it will take rund about six weeks to get the peak at hospitalizations and a mean the really bad cases.
9539,sad that your president *on steroids* still makes fun about the virus and says that it's not so scary and bad as the media showed before.

9547,"The first few groups to get vaccinated will be by institution, i.e."
9548,"healthcare workers, nursing home residents, if enough staff is deployed (most hospitals have travelling carts for flu season vaccination) those groups can be vaccinated inside 1-2 weeks."
9549,"The elderly living in the community will need to access it through their own pharmacies, but the line ups should be reasonable because no young people will be allowed vaccination at that point."
9550,"After that it would go to teachers and other essential workers, and again that would be by institution."
9551,Doesn't make my statement any less true though.
9552,Yes and yet the state I live in with similar population has done arguably better.

9628,&gt;We also have no data from then to show how many people actually had the virus vs how many people were hospitalized and killed by it.
9629,You're a lost cause on this point.
9630,The only way this matters at all is if you believe that the 1918 virus that is believed to have killed over 2 out of every 100 people on the planet actually only killed 1 out of every 500 people on the planet.
9631,"That's definitely a possibility, but every person who's studied the pandemic has dismissed that possibility."
9632,You are likely the only person in the world who believes this.
9633,"&gt;You are comparing raw numbers from an era that only provides us the number of hospitalized and the amount dead, while ignoring the lack of data from the same era that would show how many people would be mildly ill or completely asymptomatic just doesn't exist."
9634,You've got it backwards.
9635,"Me using raw data on deaths shows the absolute lowest possible IFR for that virus, because if we assume everybody in the world contracted it and 2% of people in the world died, it means it had a 2% IFR, which is significantly higher than the IFR for COVID unless you're over 70."
9636,"In reality, something like 1/3 of the population likely caught the virus that killed 2% of the population, meaning the IFR was probably closer to 6% vs the .6% estimate of the worst case scenario for the IFR of COVID."
9637,&gt;Youre also ignoring the fact that none of the technologies and medications that keep so many from dying from this virus today just didn't exist back then.
9638,Also not ignoring that.
9639,This is only relevant for developed economies and the elderly though.
9640,"It's a factor that would drive up the COVID mortality, but it's not a significant enough one that it would drive it up anything close to 10 fold, especially considering the demographic shift of 100 years ago."
9641,"All indications are that the IFR would be much lower if this virus broke out in 1918, and the main reason it's such a severe outbreak in 2020 is because of how high of a percentage the 70+ demographic represents in today's western nations."
9642,"&gt;The question i was giving my 2 cents on at the start of this thread was what if Covid happened then, when we didn't have any of these treatments or methods of testing, when we didn't have ICU beds or ventilators at all."
9643,"Because of all the factors I looked into, id still wager that if you replaced 1918 H1N1 with 2020 Covid 19, it would likely be just as severe of a pandemic,

Sure, I get that you believe that."
9644,There's almost no chance you're right though.
9645,You are focusing on the wrong thing.
9646,"Age is the reason people die with COVID, not technology."
9647,It's demonstrable by looking at the death rates in under developed countries.
9648,"They aren't losing anywhere near 2% of their populations, and countries with younger demographics have lower death rates."
9649,There would have been fewer people traveling all over the world and within countries.

9705,They would have had to completely sequenced the initial infection and the later infection if I'm getting it right?
9706,Or do the basic rtPCR tests have enough markers (I'm assuming they're using SNP markers) to be able to accurately identify between different COVID strains and not just whether COVID is present or not?
9707,SARS actually spread much more like covid than the flu.
9708,It‚Äôs R0 may have been only slightly lower and super-spreading events were responsible for a significant share of infections.
9709,The most important differences were that symptoms were usually severe and the virus did not spread at all until people were showing symptoms.
9710,That meant cases were easier to identify and simple strategies like temperature checks and quarantining sick people proved effective.

10062,The state I was in used a loophole by paying prisoners something like 7 dollars a month.
10063,Dependant of course on how much money the prisoner (offender) had on his books.
10064,Therefore we were not slaves.
10065,"We were paid employees of the state, according to the state."
10066,Even though it was a work camp.
10067,And we were treated like one might imagine a person working against his will might be treated.
10068,"We were paid, and therefore, according to some statute, not slaves."
10069,"Even though if someone had massive court costs and fees or reimbursement the state would take the money off the books, the offender was still being paid."
10070,So no slavery at all.

10082,"If people were following science and experts‚Äô recommendations (which you don‚Äôt seem to believe in), we can open things in a controlled way to lessen the impact on the economy."
10083,Plenty of other countries are successful doing just that.
10084,"But the longer people selfishly resist the mitigations, the more people will be seriously ill and die, which AGAIN has a non-zero impact to the economy."

10507,"Secondly, we combine with the fact it has a high rate of mutations, undergoes antigenic shift with other wild flu virus somewhat easily and always come into contact with such animals, makes the threat of novel flu virus always a constant threat."
10508,"Due to this, we know pandemic flu typically occurs every 20 to 40 years."

10575,Panic sells
10576,Republican here much?
10577,"Even the air we exhale is mostly nitrogen and oxygen, with just 2% CO2."
10578,&gt; This is the benefit of having a vaccine backed by a pharmagiant.
10579,"Of the four leading candidates, only Moderna doesn't have this benefit."
10580,"The Oxford team is partnered with AstraZeneca, which is a pretty big pharma company (although not as big as Pfizer)."
10581,Then there's the vaccine developed by a subsidiary of Johnson &amp; Johnson.
10582,J&amp;J is also a huge company.
10583,My take isn't bad.
10584,Trans-atlantic boats take a month and were generally very packed including many communal areas.
10585,It would spread like wildfire.
10586,Saying that I resorted to insults about your mental health is hilarious when you opened by calling me a fucking knob.
10587,You literally opened with a personal attack.
10588,Not saying it can‚Äôt happen but I‚Äôm more concerned about statistical analysis rather than anecdotes.
10589,Your grandparents sound like they were strong willed people and am glad they lived full lives.
10590,Yep.
10591,Right here in the epicenter of Burleigh County.
10592,Hospital capacity was over 90% due to forestalled elective procedures.
10593,There's much speculation that many of those are snowbirds getting their procedures done before leaving for warmer climates of AZ &amp; FL.
10594,"Covid cases are adding another layer to a system designed to run near capacity (thanks Medicare) but the locals are keeping up, so far."
10595,"Staffing is the limiting factor on capacity, not beds or equipment."
10596,"As I understand it from nurses, many of those covid pts are residents of long-term care facilities that have tested positive and aren't allowed to return yet."
10597,"Mask use is common, though not mandated."
10598,Nearly all local retail have instituted mask policies and there is good compliance with posted signage.
10599,"Group activities (sports, weddings, family events, etc) seem to be the main source of community spread."
10600,"We are aware that our per-capita graph has made us infamous, but honestly, not too much concern or fear locally."
10601,"Nearly all (with the exception the infirm elderly in long-term care) are having minor symptoms, often first assumed to be allergies or a cold."
10602,"Testing has, since May, been readily available at twice-weekly drive-thrus, free to all, and with results texted with 24-36 hrs."
10603,"Because of this easy peasy testing system, many people get tested frequently, and probably would not have done so otherwise."
10604,"As of this week, total tests have been equal to 95+% of our state population."
10605,My family tests and quarantines 10 days before we leave the area or are expecting visitors.
10606,"My wife did lose an elderly Uncle in a long-term care outbreak in a rural area of our state, but honestly, he would not have made through the winter, regardless."
10607,Just a report from the ground.
10608,"I know the graph is this:  \_\_/ , but locally, not that concerning."
10609,"Sorta like our murder rate:

 The Bismarck ND murder/homicide rate for 2018 was **2.68** per 100,000 population, a **INF% increase** from 2017."
10610,"* The Bismarck ND murder/homicide rate for 2017 was **0** per 100,000 population, a **100% decline** from 2016."
10611,"* The Bismarck ND murder/homicide rate for 2016 was **2.73** per 100,000 population, a **93.62% increase** from 2015."
10612,"* The Bismarck ND murder/homicide rate for 2015 was **1.41** per 100,000 population, a **3.42% decline** from 2014

I'm optimistic that the cold weather will flush the snowbirds (and their comorbidities)  south and the hospital capacity will return to it's normal, gov't induced, 85% occupancy rates."
10613,Stay well all.
10614,Nonsense!!
10615,I've been taking brand name Obecalp for years and never had a single side effect!
10616,[deleted]
10617,Yes I am holding up at least until the vaccine comes that's the reason for now.
10618,Thanks for asking
10619,5$ some antivax will twist this and use it as propaganda to ‚Äúprove‚Äù that the covid vaccine is lethal
10620,Lots of clicks though
10621,Yes definitely - sorry meant that I have to drive an hour to get to Lombardy.
10622,Otherwise they are right next to each other :)
10623,Look at the reports for your state if you are in the USA.
10624,They break down the deaths by age and in some cases whether they are in nursing homes.
10625,"In Minnesota, 3/4 of the deaths are residents of nursing homes, implying they are pretty frail."
10626,Florida hits different
10627,"They drafted this weeks ago, I read it, I like it."
10628,"Also I think they should do it in waves, incase anyone gets sick or has issues with the vaccine."
10629,Americans ARE stupid.
10630,NZ only has imported cases now.
10631,So does china.
10632,Korea and Japan have been keeping a lid on it.
10633,"But they locked down, then masked, tested, contact traced, and lock up anyone who is positive and won't stay home."
10634,China has reopened water parks for example.
10635,"The US Response sucks, it sucks hard, really really hard."
10636,Our own govt can't even keep welfare going.
10637,Yeah.
10638,And all of those are true with trump.
10639,OK - just as I assumed.
10640,Glad it sounds as though the vaccine was not to blame.
10641,"I'm leaning towards whine like a baby because the government shouldn't have the right to kill off tens of thousands of local businesses, but I don't think we'll have to worry about what Biden will do."
10642,And what if the reverse happens?
10643,That these hospitalizations do not grow significantly large and that the deaths stay stable or continue to fall.
10644,I'd suggest you read how trials work.
10645,There is always a placebo arm in trials.
10646,Researchers determine if the vaccine/therapy/etc.
10647,works by comparing outcomes to those in the placebo arm.
10648,"Otherwise, they wouldn't know how effective the vaccine is."
10649,Trial participants know it is a 50/50 shot.
10650,"Strictly speaking, Piedmont is one step from Lombardy :)"
10651,"Jokes on them, none of us get a good night's sleep anymore."
10652,Everything I read gives me a bad feeling about the AstraZeneca vaccine.
10653,First they overpromised on timing (remember the Oxford researcher said she was 80% confident of approval by September) and sold billions of doses to desperate countries before any testing.
10654,Then they're lobbying far right governments for a monopoly preying on toxic nationalism when their trial has not been nearly as problem free as competitors (whether it's actually safe or not is yet to be determined).
10655,Now the news that a trial participant died is followed by a leak that the participant took a placebo which clearly compromises the double blind trial.
10656,"Whether or not the vaccine is effective will be determined by science, but there needs to be a serious investigation into Oxford and AstraZeneca."
10657,"We have severe restrictions on socializing, economy is falling apart, opioid crisis is intensifying, there are many suicides and job loss."
10658,With rampant community spread in all major areas the cases and deaths will grow exponentially if we loosen restrictions.
10659,"There is no talk about elimination or eradication, there is no end game besides a vaccine."
10660,A severely restricted life until 2023?
10661,How is this doing good exactly?
10662,"Don't compare Canada to the dumpster fire in the USA, compare Canada to Australia."
10663,Australia is more or less back to normal after locking down hard on August 2nd.
10664,Australia has single digit new cases nationwide now.
10665,My brother and sister-in-law in West by god Virginia are probably responsible for this.
10666,Sigh.
10667,The only reason i don't need to read the sources to answer to you is because i was talking about an 85 yo and you answer to me me like am talking about 70+.
10668,I don't need to read anything to respond to that.
10669,"That been said, i might check them out later for personal interest, not to respond to you."
10670,It depends on how each county is doing.
10671,"So while the bay area might be loosening its restrictions, its not the same in riverside county."
10672,We'll see how the state does in december.
10673,I do think the mild weather in the state might help slow the spread.
10674,Im surprised yall texans like in n out.
10675,I know yall love your whattaburger lol
10676,"Nah, I'm just annoyed when people make huge, sweeping, and incorrect generalizations about history."
10677,It's a shame that you're too prideful to admit you had a bad take and instead you're resorting to insults about my mental health.
10678,[https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/19/world/asia/china-mask-forced-labor.html](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/19/world/asia/china-mask-forced-labor.html)
10679,Do you prefer I use Korea instead with twice the population of Canada and had 91 cases yesterday?
10680,What about Thailand with their massive protests against the government right now?
10681,They have had 3700 cases total with twice the population compared to Canada's 2500 just yesterday.
10682,How about Taiwan with 2/3s the population with 544 confirmed cases total?
10683,Or maybe Mongolia which has 1/10 the population and 320 cases total.
10684,The truth is some countries actually got their shit together and it isn't about money or hiding cases but leadership and the citizens of that country.
10685,While alot of countries have done better than the US or India plenty of others have actually kept it under control and people on those countries get to enjoy everything still being pretty normal.
10686,"Yeah, but that cuts both way because of the 12% in the southern hemisphere only a small fraction is that far south."
10687,I‚Äôm sorry.
10688,That still sucks.
10689,"Your own fucking source....

11450,Sure they are.
11451,The handfull of leagues that are hosting sporting events that are open are 25% capacity.
11452,Disney FL is 50% capacity.
11453,Disney Cali is closed indefinitely.
11454,Medium to large concerts are done.
11455,Theater/arena performances are done.
11456,All of the ancillary businesses that support entertainment are shut down and few are likely to ever recover.
11457,Social distancing goes beyond the green dot at the supermarket checkout.
11458,"&gt;The cold weather is coming

The ""sitting-outside"" weather has been over for weeks."
11459,Yesterday I woke up to 0 degrees outside.
11460,"Thankful for work-from-home :D  
Nah but they really need to get private parties under control, that of course now have moved inside as well."
11461,magneticent
11462,Wierd take.
11463,A handshake IS a formal greeting.
11464,It's not something people typically do with friends and family unless you're an emotionally repressed 70+ year old man.
11465,I am guessing pharmacies are open as well.
11466,We‚Äôre barely able to get people to listen now with the virus raging.
11467,Do public health experts and politicians honestly expect people to listen when vaccines are getting rolled out?
11468,"If they're still waking up and talking about math to 20kids, online or in person."
11469,"Sounds like they're doing their job and should get paid, just because kids can't learn as well from online doesn't mean the teachers aren't doing their job"
11470,"Yes, but then you might be taking the drug needlessly and carrying the risk of (rare and minor) side effects."
11471,Why doing that if you can test the person whose blood you were exposed to?
11472,"It's like the five second rule, only it is being used as a serious suggest."
11473,"Seriously, that's what I thought."
11474,Similar minds...

11476,From the article: Genetic and epidemiological sleuthing has shown that at least two farm workers have caught the virus from mink‚Äîthe only patients anywhere known to have become infected by animals.

11478,Depends on the effectiveness of the vaccine.
11479,The more effective it is the quicker we go back to normal.
11480,"That being said, I think most of us assume it'll take time to loosen restrictions even after mass vaccination."
11481,Honestly I'm okay with wearing a mask to stores and in public.
11482,"I usually get some kind of seasonal cold in spring and fall, but not this year so far."
11483,It makes me think we should probably always be wearing a mask to the grocery store.
11484,I would like to go to a sporting event without wearing one eventually.
11485,But I've gone on runs wearing them.
11486,I wear them anytime I'm in public.
11487,I am zero percent bothered by wearing one.
11488,I have a few and the comfortable ones I hardly notice.
11489,So true......
11490,Bad bot?
11491,I can‚Äôt even tell.
11492,*Completely* agree with that.
11493,I love social distancing.
11494,It was never suppose to be in October.

11503,Indonesia?
11504,This virus is an ambi-turner?
11505,We are screwed.
11506,Honest question since I live in an area where everyone is wearing masks at stores and restaurants; what would happen if you‚Äôd have responded with ‚Äúfuck you‚Äù?
11507,Because that would be my knee jerk reaction.

11512,And what state is that?
11513,"Vermont is basically the only state that has done well, as far as I know, and it has far fewer people than NZ, so you're not in Vermont."
11514,Wearing a mask is like wearing a bulletproof vest in a war zone.
11515,"It helps, but it‚Äôs not completely foolproof - and your best bet is to try to stay away from where they‚Äôre shooting."
11516,I absolutely think employers should provide proper PPE for COVID and all other workplace hazards.
11517,I was dismissing the narrative that workers are inherently working as unvalued pawns for rich people.
11518,"Yes that does happen, but it's not absolute."
11519,People seem to think that companies can shut down and everything will be fine.
11520,They think every business owner is swimming in a Scrooge McDuckian pool of gold coins.
11521,I'm a construction project manager working for a medium sized company.
11522,"If our shutdown had lasted since March, the company probably would have gone bankrupt by this point."
11523,Luckily the state only closed construction for a couple weeks here.
11524,"Aside from the company going bankrupt, there'd have been 200 tradespeole making good union wages collecting a check from the government instead of working."
11525,They weren‚Äôt actually stopped though...a descendant of the H1N1 pandemic is still circulating with seasonal flu today.
11526,And that virus itself is a descendant of the Spanish flu.
11527,I considered including a clarification and regret not doing so now.
11528,"I didn‚Äôt mean COVID itself, I meant the atmosphere of dealing with infectious disease (and even diseases themselves as a new COVID strain has been detected apparently)."
11529,"They should be used normally, but I hate the semantics of the phrase ‚Äúnew normal.‚Äù It implies that this is just our reality now and it‚Äôll never change."
11530,"And for now, it absolutely should be until we get out of this, though I don‚Äôt want to call it ‚Äúnormal.‚Äù But some way, somehow, eventually, we will get back to normal."

11535,"The cold weather is coming, and that may pose many problems."
11536,Getting to a high percentage vaccinated will take many months.
11537,Less than half of all Americans get the flu vaccine.
11538,And they have been around for decades.
11539,Many people trust them.
11540,Several potential Covid-19 vaccines need below zero temps for transportation and storage.
11541,I don't know if local pharmacies or doctors offices have freezers that get that cold.
11542,"Briefings are on Tuesday and Thursdays, number updates are from Tuesday until Friday each week."
11543,"Today is the day when the numbers include the weekly check between the covid-19 positive test-registry and the death register, so it might have older deaths reported to the day."
11544,"* 35 people are currently in ICU with COVID-19, this is increase of 5 compared to yesterday."
11545,* Today 7 new deaths are added to the statistics.

11551,"  There was only a single ""serious"" initial infection and that was followed by a ""mild""."
11552,That may lead credence to the theory that a high initial infection builds more anti-bodies which offers more protection.
11553,A vaccine should have similar effect.
11554,Viral load of each exposure will also have an affect.
11555,I'd be curious to see all stats simply of people getting sick twice months apart in regards to severity.
11556,"Right, even 6 feet apart in public should stick around."
11557,No reason to spread shit just because it's not corona
11558,No one knows
11559,Will that happen though?
11560,"I know here in Michigan, we set up the ability to move patients around, but mostly it was just never used."
11561,"The COVID patients were often too sick to move, anyway."
11562,So overwhelmed hospitals just had to kinda deal with it.
11563,We've luckily gotten our case counts under control.
11564,But it was a bit scary back in March-May or so.
11565,But we're picking up again.

11639,This virus is real.
11640,And this virus is scary.
11641,I think we're going to go back to normal in March also primarily because covids secondary effects will surpass the actual virus itself.
11642,"Lol

There's no discussion to be had with anti maskers"
11643,My feeling is that most students never really cared unless sick.
11644,"In most university towns except Stockholm and Gothenburg it is simply a fairly isolated group, although with huge number of interconnections inside, that don't show up in death or ICU statistics due to extremely few serious cases."
11645,Especially not last spring when testing was only severely ill and necessary workers.

11650,Also mostly everyone has their own place.

11660,You don't know much about aging.

11662,Your loaded question requires proof that the majority of positive cases got infected in pubs and restaurants.
11663,Care to provide that proof?
11664,"Well, I guess that if they needed help rounding up people for involuntary trips to quarantine centers they could ask the Chinese military for help."
11665,"If they needed help welding people in their homes, they could send for some Chinese welders."
11666,"If they decided to disappear people who don't tow the line, I'm sure they got specialists in China for that too."

11668,Basically every doctor around the world is treating COVID the same way.
11669,Public policy has nothing to do with it jfc

11671,"I could stand on top of my apartment every night and do the rain dance to end climate change, but the ice caps are still gonna melt."
11672,"Probably much fewer people, our population is a lot older now than it was in 1918"
11673,Books stores and clothing stores.
11674,Haha definitely.
11675,Ah I see.
11676,Never mind.
11677,You were correct the first time.
11678,"For some reason, I thought the Netherlands had that low of a total case count."
11679,Hello!
11680,"It seems like you haven't gotten a real answer yet so I'll give you one:

Moderna's and Pfizer's vaccine would be the first ever mRNA vaccine."
11681,What is mRNA?
11682,If you can recall your high school bio class (no judgement if you don't) DNA codes for protein.
11683,"The middle man in the process is mRNA, or messenger RNA."
11684,"It copies from one side of the DNA double helix and moves its way to the ""protein making factory"", the ribosome."
11685,"Cool story, but what does this have to do with Covid?"
11686,The surface of the coronavirus has what's called a spike protein (keyword: protein).
11687,This is what allows the virus to latch onto your cells and enter them.
11688,"When you build an immunity to the virus, your immune system will recognize the spike protein and fight it off."
11689,So there're really 2 possible ways for your immune system to recognize this.
11690,"Either being naturally exposed to the virus and surviving, or manufacture a why where your immune system can recognize the spike protein before real contact with the virus."
11691,The latter is where the vaccine comes in.
11692,Basically the vaccine is an mRNA that codes only for the spike protein.
11693,Your own cells will produce the spike protein (but not the full virus) which will then be recognized by your immune system.
11694,And thus you're immune to Covid (or theoretically this one strand of it)

### Summary

**What is already known about this topic?"
11732,"**

As of October 15, 216,025 deaths from COVID-19 have been reported in the United States; however, this might underestimate the total impact of the pandemic on mortality."
11733,**What is added by this report?
11734,"**

Overall, an estimated 299,028 excess deaths occurred from late January through October 3, 2020, with 198,081 (66%) excess deaths attributed to COVID-19."
11735,The largest percentage increases were seen among adults aged 25‚Äì44 years and among Hispanic or Latino persons.
11736,**What are the implications for public health practice?
11737,"**

These results inform efforts to prevent mortality directly or indirectly associated with the COVID-19 pandemic, such as efforts to minimize disruptions to health care."
11738,It's not that people don't care.
11739,"It's calculated risk, and the alternative is to isolate for more than a year."
11740,Elaborate what?
11741,This is a normal course of practice in our country.
11742,"Private hospital charges 3x more amount but the level of service is horrible

The patient gets badly abused by nurses."
11743,From my own experience
11744,Were people wearing masks when talking to each other in the pub and at restaurants?
11745,True.
11746,"The biggest denier I know leased new cars, spent every penny, never saved for retirement a bit."
11747,"You're welcome to wear mask until 2030, the rest of us will go on with our life without wearing a mask and social distancing"
11748,Because there is not an organized federal response.
11749,"It's not a pleasure to correct you but yeah, treatment has become only slightly better."
11750,Remdesivir shows to have no effect at all in newer data.
11751,Dexamethason saves like 1 in 8 severe cases (NNT).
11752,Later invasive ventilation and longer non-invasive high-flow plus better anticoagulation regimens help somewhat but not on a level that it would be demographically meaningful.
11753,Best way is not to have people get into the ICU at all.
11754,Who has been more successful dealing with covid?
11755,"It's not about taking sides with the ""enemy"" it's about helping each other."
11756,This podcast provides an update on COVID-19 vaccines and to discuss the upcoming Vaccines and Related Biological Products Advisory Committee meeting.

11763,I‚Äôd take a look at r/hempflowers for some current recommendations.
11764,"It is definitely important to look at lab results and see how much CBD is in it, how much THCA (87% of it gets converted to THC which generally makes the actual THC content between .05% and 1%), other minor cannabinoids like CBG and CBC that add to the effect, and also terpenes if they have those labs."
11765,You generally want between the 1% and 3%.
11766,You‚Äôll probably have to experiment with what strain works best for you though as there‚Äôs indica and sativa like strains for hemp as well.
11767,Boston Public schools just announced they are going full remote

11783,"Campania, around Naples, escaped largely unscathed from Italy‚Äôs first coronavirus wave in the spring, but the region has seen infections soar in recent weeks and local authorities have closed most schools until the end of October."
11784,"‚ÄúMothers called me and said the kids are in floods of tears, they want to go back to school, they don‚Äôt understand why schools need to be stopped,‚Äù said Pamela Buda, while holding a class for pupils sitting on public steps in central Naples."
11785,Tonino Stornaiuolo yells out his lessons to pupils listening from their balconies and on the streets outside their homes.
11786,"‚ÄúWe do everything to respect the rules because I think this emergency in Italy is serious and real,‚Äù Stornaiuolo said."
11787,"The government has so far avoided imposing nationwide curbs on schools, businesses and freedom of movement, but has urged regional authorities to draw up their own restrictions if needed."
11788,"Lombardy, where Milan is located, has already introduced a curfew from 11 p.m. to 5.00 a.m. to put a stop to late night gatherings."
11789,Campania has said it will follow suit.
11790,"[nL8N2HB5ZV]

‚ÄúI wanted to find a way in which the kids could see us and share time with us, at least as long as it is possible and until we know whether there will be another lockdown,‚Äù Stornaiuolo added."
11791,"It's rare to get it twice (mostly just people who got it very young, like under 6 months old)."
11792,"But in terms of the chicken pox virus, you don't get it twice because you never get rid of it the first time."

11808,"This is true of any virus, even viruses the medical literature says confer decades-long or lifelong immunity such as chicken pox or measles."
11809,There are always reinfection cases because nothing is ever 100%.
11810,"The questions are really then:

How often does COVID-19 reinfection happen?"
11811,How long after initial infection does it typically occur?
11812,"Is the reinfection generally milder, the same, or more severe?"
11813,I agree.
11814,We're willing to put up with lockdowns and quarantines and restrictions because everyone is vulnerable and we have no choice.
11815,"But once we DO have a choice and are able to do something to protect ourselves, then fuck restrictions."
11816,I just hope the vaccine will be accessible to everyone who needs/wants it.
11817,If you're not wearing a mask now... you are part of the problem.
11818,Fair
11819,Should officials be giving the public more information on good ventilation too?
11820,I don't hear this talked about often.
11821,"I also think officials are going a bad job at explaing ""why* we need to reduce indoor contact, they are failing to explain how it spreads indoors."
11822,I think if we educated the general public more they'd actually get it.

11829,You think it would correspond with those most likely to have a bad initial acute infection.
11830,We probably wouldn't be completely back to normal until 2022.
11831,"You might be wondering, ugh, why?"
11832,"Well, you see, vaccine distribution takes time."
11833,"It's not a one-and-done thing that happens within a day, or even a week."
11834,"I know a lot of you would like to go back to normal immediately after you take the vaccine, but I'm sorry, those are not realistic expectations."
11835,Will things eventually improve?
11836,Of course.
11837,"However, there's a long fight ahead to bring it completely under control, that could take up to a year, or even longer."
11838,News about Ukraine are a bit hard to find in general.

11841,Agreed.
11842,"Everything I've read about vaccine development and distribution suggests that we will be ""lucky"" to have things ""back to normal"" in 2022."
11843,Thoughts and prayers.
11844,Virtual church would help too.
11845,"I'm not saying that they don't do anything, but with a larger spread one could think that the curve takes a longer time to go down as well."
11846,"Just one more post then I'm off:

&gt;Schools were closed

Schools from 16+ was closed in Sweden, Norway [said](https://omni.se/norges-strategi-sparade-liv-men-fel-att-stanga-skolor/a/7K0nlK) that in in hindsight their decision to close elementary schools was wrong."
11847,"&gt;Organized sport activities were discontinued

Same in Sweden, [14th June](https://www.folkhalsomyndigheten.se/smittskydd-beredskap/utbrott/aktuella-utbrott/covid-19/verksamheter/information-till-idrotts--och-traningsanlaggningar/) it was allowed again, but still today an audiences are not allowed."
11848,"&gt;public utilities like gyms/sports events/cultural activities were closed

Gyms where open, but no sports events, museums closed and in effect of the 50 limit/general compliance/monetary reasons/fear there was no  events."
11849,"Cinemas also closed down since no one went, even though it was allowed."
11850,"Hairdressers and similar close contact was open in Sweden, but not in Norway."
11851,&gt;restaurants/bars were closed too.
11852,"[Wrong](https://www.nrk.no/norge/alle-utdanningsinstitusjoner-stenges-_-flere-arrangementer-og-virksomheter-far-forbud-1.14940952), restaurants was kept open in Norway with the same rules as we have here, if they can have a 1m space between etc."
11853,Night clubs are still closed in Sweden.
11854,&gt;Residents from outside Sweden/Finland were subjected to mandatory quarantine if they chose to return.
11855,"Sweden did not, but in effect it had the same since all countries more or less closed down/banned Swedish people so not that many traveled, except for cross-border work which was open between all countries."
11856,&gt;They also banned public gatherings during the lockdown.
11857,"Yes, but there wasn't many 50 people events during the peak, since everyone stayed home."
11858,"So you see, there was differences, but they were quite similar (except for the timing), it does does not explain ten times more dead."
11859,"Somehow everyone believe that it was business as usual in Sweden, when it was not."
11860,You‚Äôre right - there isn‚Äôt one way to do college.
11861,But to tell people that the real point is merely to get a job where you can make easy money is a bit narrow minded
11862,Proof that masks don't work.
11863,Masks have been mandated indoors since 9/14 and have done nothing at all to mitigate the spread.
11864,"When the first mask mandate was cancelled (late July) and noone wore them, cases didn't go up for 3 months."
11865,People are now wearing surgical masks (instead of the cloth bullshit in March/April/May when PPE was impossible to find) and it has had no positive effect anyways.
11866,"""Conclusions:¬†Chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine have antiviral characteristics in vitro."
11867,The findings support the hypothesis that these drugs have efficacy in the treatment of COVID-19.
11868,People are currently using these drugs for malaria.

11899,"&gt; I always wondered how a virus ‚Äúknows‚Äù when it‚Äôs in a host cell

A lot of molecular biology boils down to ""protein A's shape matches protein B's shape and so they interact well""."
11900,"Many viruses don't even need to enter the cell altogether, just poke a hole in the wall and inject the ""good"" stuff."
11901,"Again, that's triggered by lock-and-key interactions between molecules with specific shapes."
11902,"COVID-19 can infect cells in your nose because it has stuff on its surface that matches (detects) the shape of stuff on those cells, and that's how it ""figures out"" it's in the right place."
11903,Antivirals work by jamming this mechanism (like sticking gum in a keyhole so the key won't fit).

11938,Not really.
11939,We are on the exact trajectory of everyone else.

11941,We will have the highest numbers in Europe within weeks if we don't shutdown.
11942,I put the the lower deaths in Germany down to us being anti social.
11943,Yes.
11944,Because the only way to bring cases down is to create a closed system.
11945,Extra points for a closed system with less moving parts.
11946,And since one country cannot control the population nor laws or procedures of another country.
11947,Closing yourself to outsiders helps.

11950,I hadn't updated the rate from early estimates based on SARS.
11951,"I have corrected my comment, thank you."
11952,I just looked it up and it the flu mutates 4X more quickly that COVID (COVID has twice as large of a genome and has half the mutations in the same amount of time).
11953,"It is important to be accurate, so thanks."
11954,"Anyway, here's where you are really confused:

&gt;The first recorded case of Covid reinfection was from different strains...

No, ALL confirmed cases of reinfection are from different strains."
11955,That's because it is literally a definitional requirement to prove a case of reinfection.
11956,"Even if a reinfection actually happened with the same strain, it is not possible to prove that it wasn't just the first infection that never cleared."
11957,"Therefore, to be a confirmed reinfection it has to, by definition, be different strains."
11958,We simply don't count same-strain reinfection.
11959,It doesn't follow that that means that different strains is what is causing the reinfections.
11960,"In fact, scientists think that waning immunity to covid is the cause of reinfections, not different strains, as the strains are not different enough in places that matter to do that."
11961,This is why scientists are pretty confident that a vaccine will work for any strain (at least thus far).
11962,"Anyway, you seem really confu"
11963,"Hate to be that guy but I took my first test last week (I only had the common cold but had to get tested), and I stood in line, outside, with the wind blowing down on me, for 45 minutes."

12034,"You don't have to work that job, you can be like everyone who had a non essential job."
12035,A lot of people I know with non-essential jobs were still able to work from home.
12036,Which I already stated I can‚Äôt do.
12037,"And if I apply for a job, and I don‚Äôt get hired, how do you suggest I make money to support my family?"

12040,"/s

&gt; When did I compare your job to Disneyland?"
12041,You compared an essential job with a non-essential job.
12042,Disney World was just the most recent topic.
12043,"**EDIT**: right here, smooth brain."
12044,"&gt; And don't complain or make excuses since you are fine with non essential businesses like Disneyland being forced to shut down

My job = essential; Disney World = non-essential."
12045,Are you even paying attention?
12046,&gt; My point is if you want a lockdown that is going to put many non essential workers out of work than you should be willing to do the same.
12047,Why?
12048,My job is deemed essential.
12049,Whether or not I agree with that is moot.
12050,"I need an income; in order to acquire that income, I need to do my job - a job I can‚Äôt do from home, like a lot of other people can."
12051,"So basically, I can either never leave my house, just order what I want from Amazon and it will magically appear since nobody has to go anywhere to get it to me, and quit my job because someone else got laid off; or ... what exactly?"
12052,"**SECOND EDIT**:

An additional response to this

&gt; My point is if you want a lockdown that is going to put many non essential workers out of work than you should be willing to do the same."
12053,"My point is if you want everything to re-open that is going to put many people of all walks of life at risk of COVID-19, then you should be willing to wear a mask, social distance, etc."

12055,&gt;It doesn't have to be a conspiracy.
12056,This needs to be stated more often.
12057,There doesn't have to be a conspiracy for something bad to be going on.
12058,"When you have lots of selfish individuals acting in their own interests, they can act in a way that's indistinguishable from a conspiracy."
12059,The majority of conspiracy theories arise due to people with power or influence being complete dickheads.
12060,"Conspiracy theories are usually wrong, but they shouldn't be ignored: they're an indication that the public is highly dissatisfied with the direction their society is going in."
12061,"I don't care, he can continue if he wants to, just need to now if he got banned last time"
12062,Having to wear masks and keeping distance from people when possible isn‚Äôt the same thing as a lockdown.
12063,Vaccines are preventative.
12064,They aren‚Äôt cures.
12065,That seems expensive.
12066,Brain mri with contrast for me was only around 8-9k

12113,From what I've heard a lot of less developed countries actually have better population infection control measures because it's more common.

In good medical science to get unbiased results the test setting is done ""double blindfolded""."

12306,&gt;Eli Lilly and Co said late on Tuesday it had hired an independent consultant to review a plant producing its promising COVID-19 drug after receiving notices from the U.S. health regulator.
12307,&gt;The company reiterated that it had not received a warning letter from the U.S. Food and Drugs Administration following inspections at the plant first revealed by Reuters last week.
12308,"&gt;The company, however, also reiterated that it had received an Official Action Indicated (OAI) notice from the FDA in relation to issues at its Branchburg plant in New Jersey."

12331,"Came down with it again in late February, 4 days after I went back to work, it was Much worse."
12332,I personally think part of what‚Äôs going to make winter worse is because of the major holidays that fall around winter and multiple people have decided they are tired of the virus and/or don‚Äôt care anymore so they will do large gatherings.
12333,Hence super spreading
12334,Community spread is still a major issue in Florida; cast members are part of this community but people staying on Disney property are not.

12365,Yup hopefully not.

12377,China is a population of over a billion with smartphones everywhere.
12378,Yet no sign of any large outbreaks in months.
12379,The idea of a large outbreak of COVID in China is completely inconsistent with the data we get every day.

12628,There is a lot of considerations and we won't know what's really happening for a few months after wide deployment.

12679,It eliminates any benefit one would hope to accomplish through widespread vaccination unless you‚Äôre able to routinely re-vaccinate people once or twice a year.
12680,That complication is almost certain to reduce the number of people who get vaccinated regularly which further reduces the chance that herd immunity is achieved.
12681,No herd immunity = virus continues to spread and mutate.

12721,"Yeah, a lot of the people masochistically jerking themselves off over the idea of indefinite lockdown aren't taking into account humanity's tolerance for such restrictions."
12722,Right now people are complying (in most places) to buy time for research to come to fruition and a safe easing of restrictions to be engaged.
12723,"If it becomes clear that compliance is not an investment in future safety but is just an endless state of quarantine, the public's tolerance will plummet."
12724,"At that point, you simply cannot enforce house arrest on an entire planet."
12725,"And if implementing martial law to enforce quarantine on the world became the only solution, wouldn't everyone start to consider the cure worse than the disease?"

13049,Then we had the dog sniff them and when he signaled on the low blood sugar cotton ball he got a treat.
13050,"Over time, we varied the number of cotton balls, blood sugar levels, etc to make it more and more difficult while rewarding for correct signals."

## Abstract

The COVID-19 pandemic has motivated many open and collaborative analytical research projects with real-world impact."
13139,"However, despite their value, such activities are generally overlooked by traditional academic metrics."
13140,"Science is ultimately improved by analytical work, whether ensuring reproducible and well-documented code to accompany papers, developing and maintaining flexible tools, sharing and curating data, or disseminating analysis to wider audiences."
13141,"To increase the impact and sustainability of modern science, it will be crucial to ensure these analytical activities‚Äîand the people who do them‚Äîare valued in academia."
13142,How about cadaver dogs?
13143,Not a problem at all!
13144,"In general, when examining a new drug or vaccine, a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study is considered the gold standard."
13145,As long as you keep the lockdown up yes.

&gt; Perhaps the only thing worse than being subjected to seemingly arbitrary and intrusive rules imposed to fight a pandemic is when those same rules fail to accomplish their goals."
13151,"Instead of effective infectious disease control, you get fatigue with commands issued by officials who seem to have no idea what they're doing, as we're seeing during the COVID-19 crisis."
13152,"Given the resulting pushback against ineffective, nonsensical rules, expect widespread cynicism toward official dictates to linger after the virus is history."
13153,&gt; Consider New York Gov.
13154,"Andrew Cuomo, a Democrat who, early in the crisis, ordered his state's nursing homes‚Äîover their protests‚Äîto take in people who had tested positive for COVID-19."
13155,"""In the weeks that followed the March 25 order,"" ProPublica reported, the disease ""tore through New York state's nursing facilities, killing more than 6,000 people."""
13156,"&gt; While that fatal error did not lead Cuomo to grapple publicly with his own poor judgment, it did diminish his credibility."
13157,He later decreed which drinking establishments were allowed to open based not on health criteria but on their sale of snacks.

13161,"""The lowest level of substantive food were sandwiches."""
13162,"He was soon reduced to issuing repeated complaints about the multitude of bars engaged in ""egregious violations of pandemic-related Executive Orders."""
13163,&gt; Not that New York was alone.
13164,"In Texas, where forced business closures and stay-at-home orders hobbled social relations and economic activity without preventing a summer surge of COVID-19 cases, over 800 bars joined together to open in defiance of state rules."
13165,"&gt; ""Recently we have spoken with business owners who tell us they don't intend to follow the orders,"" A. Bentley Nettles, executive director of the Texas Alcoholic Beverage Commission, said in a press release."
13166,"Officialdom was not happy about being ignored, but bar owners lost patience with rules that proved more effective at killing bars than eliminating viruses."
13167,"&gt; The revolt among establishments serving alcoholic beverages is relatively easy to track, because they're closely monitored."
13168,"But you see the same rule fatigue among barbershops, car washes, furniture stores, gyms, smoke shops, and even houses of worship."
13169,"""After California Gov."
13170,"Gavin Newsom shut down indoor religious services for the majority of the state, some churches chose to defy the order,"" The Sacramento Bee reported in late July."
13171,"&gt; Newsom had already blinked once on the issue, softening restrictions after hundreds of churches vowed to reopen at the end of May despite being deemed ""nonessential"" and thus subject to closure orders."
13172,"""The current governmental orders are not narrowly tailored here because innumerable secular enterprises and places where people gather are deemed essential, including those that pose even greater risks of COVID-19 than religious assemblies,"" pastors protested in an open letter."
13173,"&gt; Inconsistency about whether mask wearing was virtuous or antisocial also bred defiance of mask requirements, turning the pieces of fabric into ""a flash point in the virus culture wars,"" as The New York Times put it."
13174,"Blame for the controversy can be laid, at least in part, on confusion sown by government officials themselves."
13175,"&gt; ""Seriously people- STOP BUYING MASKS!"""
13176,U.S.
13177,"Surgeon General Dr. Jerome Adams tweeted on February 29, in an effort to maximize masks available to health care workers."
13178,"""They are NOT effective in preventing general public from catching #Coronavirus."""
13179,"&gt; By June, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention had changed its messaging and was urging general use of masks."
13180,"But that guidance was contradicted by the World Health Organization, which said that ""the widespread use of masks everywhere is not supported by high-quality scientific evidence."""
13181,"&gt; Even as calls for voluntary behavior were botched and muddled, mask mandates spread like wildfire, enforced by fines and even police stings in some jurisdictions."
13182,"Inevitably, mask-wearing rules resulted in refusal and even violence by people bristling at conflicting claims and commands from supposedly responsible authorities."
13183,"&gt; Beyond the human cost of COVID-19, government credibility is a victim of this pandemic."
13184,"It's unlikely to recover anytime soon, no matter how the health crisis itself is resolved."
13185,Interesting take on things.
13186,How do you think we should've released our messages?
13187,What mistakes would you avoid?
13188,Always happens like that
13189,"I have been trying to get a different perspective here, since I have been an essential worker in an essential industry for the duration, so I have had a  much different experience than many other people who have been able to shelter."
13190,I rarely see it addressed or talked about and I get the impression it makes some people uncomfortable.
13191,"A few observations that have colored my opinion on this-
In March/April/May where I am was absolutely ‚Äúlocked down‚Äù."
13192,"I was on the road daily driving to my workplace and it moved me to tears a few times since the freeways, roads and streets were empty."
13193,I have a hard time believing that people didn‚Äôt lock down fully during that time.
13194,"The lock down was magnitudes harder in almost every way for those that could not shelter in place, examples include-
Grocery shopping- since neither my partner nor I was at home, home grocery deliveries were not an option since our availability was outside the window."
13195,Going into the store at the peak was also difficult due to the shortened hours.
13196,Work- our workloads and hours doubled due to a variety of reasons including increased load/demand due to lockdown and decreased workforce due to distancing/health reasons.
13197,This resulted in greater exposure and time outside of the home.
13198,The above made logistics and groceries even more difficult.
13199,"We have children- we lost our childcare and had to resort to options that were not as stable for our children, increasing their exposure and ours."
13200,"We had very limited options for schooling in spring and early fall, with very little workable solutions."
13201,Our children were at risk of falling behind (they did not since we worked with them late into the night) while still having increased exposure and risk.
13202,The frequent advice I have seen here and elsewhere is ‚Äúpay a parent to stay home‚Äù.
13203,"There are several articles and studies that show that this will frequently fall on the mother, reversing years of progress for working women."
13204,"The ask to expose ourselves for work (that is needed for even a stay at home society- maybe even more so), while not seeing friends, family, support systems or having education for children wears on mental wellbeing and frankly creates a rage that is difficult to to describe (I was and I‚Äôm trying to get back to my default happy go lucky nature)."
13205,"So my questions are - there are two very difference experiences during the lockdowns, how do you compensate for that?"
13206,While most workforce‚Äôs have made themselves ‚Äúsafe‚Äù how do you reduce infection in the essential population.
13207,"How do you take care of people and their families doing these roles (childcare, groceries, mental well being)?"
13208,How do you keep spread from happening again once you are open?
13209,How do you ensure the wage gap for women does not became a wage canyon as they are left without resources?
13210,Thank you for your consideration.

I know it says covid complications but I cant find it stated in any other articles, nor actual cause."
13235,I mean like is it cardiac arrest or pulmonary embolism or something.
13236,It doesnt seem to be a major factor based on the numbers we have.

13254,I spent decades of my life slathered in sunblock because sun = black and cancer = bad and both parents had nasty skin conditions.

13268,"Minimal genetic changes, no persistence in hosts or environment (other than chinese bat caves) and high infectivity that may produce a natural herd immunity."
13269,A vaccine could easily drop infection below R0 of 1 and eliminate the virus.
13270,"Depends on the vaccine, but the primary endpoint for most of the trials is the elimination of SARS-COV-2 infection progressing to covid-19 pneumonia."
13271,"Most of them are measuring the infection risk as well, but that's not the primary endpoint."
13272,"Not sure, but there in September were wedding receptions for 150 people (registering multiple events for the same couple in the same place), packed trains, packed restaurants."

13303,The 2009 Swine Flu pandemic is an example of a minor one.
13304,"It spread widely, but it had a low IFR and most of the countries didn't bother locking down or setting major restrictions."
13305,It was in development for a long time.
13306,"Afaik, it was for MERS, passed animal tests but wasn't tested in humans."
13307,In general I don't trust adenovirus vector itself because of pre-existing immunity and the potential of immune mediated complications.
13308,Doesn't help that adverse effects have been observed in both Oxford and J&amp;J candidates.
13309,At this stage I trust Chinese inactivated vaccine much more than I do Oxford one.

13312,What is the one message that you would give to the U.S. Federal government to convey the dire need for cogent leadership during this time?

13315,You should be able to read an AP news article though.
13316,https://apnews.com/37fdcb046044483d256c612d4432d7c9
13317,Face shields are designed to be always worn with masks.
13318,"I'm less worried about overly cautious behaviour than I am about cavalier attitudes towards the virus, but I hear your point, especially because I like evidence-based guidance and there's no evidence that suggests you need to wear a mask if you're out walking in a deserted park!"
13319,"For those people who err on the side of caution, I'd start by saying 'thank you for doing your part to keep not just yourself safe but your community, too' and then I'd talk about what the best guidance is, based on the evidence."
13320,if I was concerned that their behaviours were so extreme that they were putting them in harm's way (e.g.
13321,"extreme isolation) I'd ask about that, but bear in mind we can't always know why a person is taking the precautions very seriously and if it's because of a particular health condition or something else that puts them at high risk of illness."

13326,Because you have the same excuses.
13327,The CRO and sponsor can unblind as needed.
13328,They just need a reason to do so.
13329,"If regulators come in to review the data and it turns out they were peeking at the data or unblinding without good reason or documentation, they'll question whether the sponsor in particular was making experiment design decisions that could influence the outcome (say, deciding to enroll more patients to reach statistical significance or stopping enrollment if the data is very favorable)."
13330,But of course the CRO and ultimately the sponsor have ways of knowing who was in what arm.
13331,"It's how they'll justify that the drug worked, by comparing against a control."
13332,Because
13333,"Daily new cases so far in North America: 49,000

13334,you'll have several issues involving weekends and holidays.
13335,"say the death happens today, doctor signs off on it today, coroner looks it over tomorrow, it's reported to the health department who adds it to their list friday afternoon, it's reported on saturday (for example) but if the death occured on saturday maybe the coroner didn't sign off till monday, but then tuesday is a staff meeting at the health department, so they didn't add the death until wednesday and it was reported with thursday's numbers....and then there's times when huge backlogs are sorted out at once"

13343,Do you want to lockdown or not?
13344,"But then you debunked your own answer, because group b could just social distance and wear mask."
13345,You are stereotyping people who think covid is overblown as people who all drive trucks and talk with a country accent.
13346,I really hate how this is getting twisted on some sites.
13347,"Participants die in most, if not all, clinical trials (in both the investigational and placebo arms) for all kinds of reasons."
13348,"It's why there are \*usually\* so many hurdles before in-human trials can begin and, even then, some participant deaths are expected"
13349,Well yea there will prob be a vaccine.
13350,"But how many of us ""normal"" individuals will have received it?"
13351,"Also, how many in the U.S. will not want to take it?"

Covid Party: It's like a Pox Party, but for Covid-19 rather than Chicken Pox."
13357,"People in attendance intentionally catch and spread the virus in an effort to ""get it over with"" and build up herd immunity."
13358,"Their belief is that it isn't as bad as the media claims, and that once caught it can't be caught again."
13359,"They don't have evidence for this, but they do trust certain people in the government, and distrust certain other people in the government."
13360,"How: The government is not coordinated on this front and has sent mixed messages, directly resulting in the deaths the kinds of people we are talking about."
13361,"What I said: ""These people would rather risk sacrificing their lives to a virus than risk mild inconveniences for their fellow man."""
13362,"What you said: ""6 months of isolation and loneliness are not mild inconveniences."
13363,"COVID is a real thing that we need to respect, but we also need to respect the sacrifices people are making, rather than be flippant, and pretend that it's trivial."""
13364,"I'm sorry to say it man, but your comments have little to do with the topic, except perhaps to put words in my mouth - because I never said (anywhere), that isolation and loneliness were no big deal."
13365,Nor have I said that they were necessary.
13366,I also never disrespected the sacrifices people have made.
13367,"Hell, I'm one of those people."
13368,We all have to work and get on with our lives.
13369,But partying to catch the virus like a YOLO idiot is an appropriate target of our derision.
13370,"But you can't counter what I said, not directly, because you'll come across as another idiot if you do."
13371,"The best you can do is argue with a straw man and misrepresent my position, then whine about it because I don't let it go unnoticed."
13372,"So we're just going to forget the almost daily attacks on the CDC and FDA by the current administration, are we?"
13373,"while that might be nice advice for a person at an already healthy weight, for overweight/obese it‚Äôs generally their entire lifestyle that is why they‚Äôre overweight or obese."
13374,"don‚Äôt get me wrong, being mindful of what we eat is essential, just like exercise is, but to get these people truly healthy in body, mind and soul they need really significant support."
13375,"you can exercise all you want, eat a clean diet and still hold onto fat if you‚Äôre sedentary for hours at a time."
13376,on average people are sedentary for 12 hours so you can see the scope of the bigger problem.
13377,enzymes that break down fat are almost entirely shut off after you sit down for a short period of time.
13378,exercise doesn‚Äôt offset this unless you‚Äôre actually taking breaks to stand up and move around a couple times per hour.
13379,it can also be assumed these people are going to have some level of depression or anxiety and that needs to be treated as well.
13380,it goes waaaaay beyond counting calories for these people.
13381,"their bodies are literally rotting and aging faster than their healthy counterparts, it‚Äôs extremely nuanced and imo, a crisis far greater then society actually gives credence."
13382,Good luck.
13383,It's a great idea until you're married as having covid because you had bacon for breakfast.
13384,What?
13385,"It‚Äôs pretty evident, yes."
13386,"Seems like a good candidate for ""Porque los nos dos?"""
13387,"Airports, school entrances, public transit."
13388,"Lots of places where, sure the dogs might miss some, but they will still catch some!"
13389,That seems worth it.
13390,That would actually work unironically.
13391,Are they saying the goal is to eliminate COVID?
13392,I never got that from public health messaging.
13393,Have you tried going against this?
13394,Was it as hard as you thought?
13395,I know some people can be jerks about people wanting to eat different to others but real friends shouldn't do this.
13396,Learning new recipes and shopping routines also takes time but it's a good cause to make the effort for.
13397,It's messed up if sticking to eating traditions is what ends the human race.
13398,We never used to eat this much meat either.
13399,"1/30,000 mortality (30k participants right?)"
13400,is not that high.
13401,"And now we can say that the vaccine reduces covid death rate by 100% (RR=0 with n=1, 95% CI 0.27-15.34)."
13402,"I'm more mature, my time is spent devoted to studying and teaching my passions, I've met a lot of extremely bright and wonderful people, lots of awesome parties, I met my current and hopefully permanent partner."
13403,Things like that.
13404,Does the flu kill people at the same rate as COVID-19?
13405,"No,

You don‚Äôt expect society to pay for your low risk tolerance."
13406,We don‚Äôt owe you years of life lost for something that kills 0.23% of it‚Äôs victims.
13407,"Unfortunately for you, society can only bare living like this for so long, they‚Äôll see things my way."
13408,Hunker down friend.
13409,We‚Äôre not doing this for much longer.
13410,"That‚Äôs what I‚Äôm also assuming, yeah"
13411,There's no reason for this to even be newsworthy if he took the placebo.
13412,It may also not be newsworthy if he had taken the actual vaccine and then got hit by a bus.
13413,Why does it sound bad?
13414,[deleted]
13415,"Well whatever you want to call it, unless they add new outside inmates it doesn't look like the virus can spread all that much more."
13416,"Current numbers show just one active case:  https://www.marinij.com/2020/03/26/marin-county-covid-19-status-update/

I'm sure the threshold for herd immunity is especially high in a tightly packed prison but I would think these numbers should look encouraging for controlling future outbreaks."
13417,i think there needs to be a set of definitions that everyone agrees on.
13418,say stage 1 is full wuhan lock down.
13419,"stage 2 is 5 person family bubble, stage 3 is everything but bars and huge venues open, etc etc

and then when articles come out like that they can say ""we're not saying ya'll have to lockdown forever, we're talking about stage X for so many months"" or whatever"
13420,"Luckily, the CDC has just clarified that to be a cumulative 15 minutes within a 24-hour period."
13421,I'm so sorry to hear about your mum feeling alone.
13422,"To be honest, social isolation of older adults was already a huge problem even before Covid-19."
13423,This pandemic has just made it worse.
13424,"As much as I hate the thought of your mum feeling lonely, I'm more worried about well-intentioned people trying to keep her company and then exposing her to the virus."
13425,"Having said that, your family might choose to take some calculated risks and try to see her (since nothing in life is zero risk and in public health we're big on risk reduction)."
13426,"Her strategy of rapid tests a few days before you see her is not a bad one, but it's not foolproof."
13427,"Consider that certain tests in particular can come back falsely positive, or that someone might get a test this morning, get a negative result a day later, BUT in the meantime - in the time between the test and the result, they were exposed and of course the test wouldn't pick that up."
13428,Your family is in a rough spot having to choose between not so great options and I'm so sorry for that.
13429,"If you were going to take the chance, the best - but logistically challenging - way to do it would be for anyone who was going to see her would be to get tested and then isolate for 14 days beforehand."
13430,"Missed flight, maybe annoyed, but that a small price to pay to get the world back on track during a pandemic."
13431,And you wouldn't need to quarantine if you had a negative test after being snuffed by a dog.
13432,I don't think anyone wants to throw someone into quarantine for 2 weeks because a dog snuffed something.
13433,Use a medical test to confirm or deny the dog sniff.
13434,Certainly.
13435,"In the case of Corona, I don‚Äôt think you get to 100k without the bulk being old."
13436,"In a future pandemic, this could wind up being a whole new world of shit in regards to peoples‚Äô risk tolerance."
13437,"Again, we‚Äôre talking about society as a whole, not individual risk assessments."
13438,"Even if it wasn't the placebo, vaccine are never 100% protection, if it  even only gave 20% protection I'll happily take it."
13439,... the alternative is ***not*** economic collapse.
13440,You're still just arguing for corporate welfare.
13441,"Look at South Korea, Japan, China, AUS/NZ, most of Europe..."
13442,"Honestly, look at basically any other country in the world besides Brazil."
13443,"They had aggressive shutdowns and quarantine curfews for multiple weeks, and their economies are, generally speaking, doing quite well under the circumstances - which is to say, acting somewhat conservatively and cautiously due to, you know, the global pandemic, but poised to regain their stride when conditions improve, while simultaneously *not* forcing anyone (unless absolutely necessary, e.g."
13444,"healthcare, law enforcement, etc) to engage in unsafe activities."
13445,This economic quandary is a crisis *entirely of our own making*.
13446,"If companies in the US were riding so close to the financial edge that they can't handle reduced operations and revenue for a quarantine period *due to a pandemic* and force people to work and get exposed to covid as a result, the free market should be allowed to punish those companies, and those workers who were hurt by idiotic profiteering policies should *absolutely* be given their pound of flesh."
13447,"It may not look that bad, but the positioning of Dallas relative to June is not ideal."
13448,"https://covid-texas.csullender.com/?tsa=E

In June there were fewer hospital beds used overall so there was more bandwidth for the surge, now there isn't."
13449,"Still, the focus should be on El Paso."

13452,did you eat through your nose?
13453,"I shouldn‚Äôt have to say this, but being skeptical of lockdowns and other draconian measures isn‚Äôt ‚ÄúCovid denial‚Äù, it is common sense."
13454,80k suicides?
13455,the difference between confirmed covid deaths and excess death?
13456,not convincing.
13457,&gt; I'm happy to wear a mask until there's a vaccine but why would I wear one after getting vaccinated?
13458,"I'm happy to use the seat belt, but why should I continue to use it after the brakes get fixed?"
13459,"Simple explanation: no vaccine is magically perfect, that only happens in fairy tales."
13460,Some are around 50%.
13461,Some are around 75% (the flu vaccine is in that ballpark).
13462,There are a few that are over 90% (like the measles vaccine).
13463,"If this vaccine is not very close to 99% and there's still a lot of cases in your neighborhood, your risk will not decrease that much."
13464,"We need to do two things to win this war:

1."
13465,"Get most of the population immunized (ideally via vaccine, as opposed to rampant infections)
2."
13466,"Get the number of infections pretty low (which will definitely happen when enough people will be immune via the previous point)

When those two conditions are true where you live, you can take your mask off."
13467,"\#2 will happen automatically if we do enough of #1, so we know where the focus should be."
13468,"Basically, do enough of #1 until #2 auto-clicks in place."
13469,&gt; I don't wear a mask if I get the flu vaccine.
13470,"Yes, because flu and covid are totally the same thing."
13471,/s
13472,"You are right, I don‚Äôt think flu deaths are useful except as an indicator of where we know for sure risk tolerance is."
13473,I really think it‚Äôs around 100k if counting the same way COVID official deaths are counted.
13474,"Reduce the toll by a factor of 3.5-4 and we go back to total normal, with people not comfortable with the risk being able to mask-up."
13475,I also think we‚Äôll see an estimated death count with vaccine and without.
13476,"With people who take vaccine, it will obviously be significantly lower."
13477,"Once all vulnerable people have opportunity to take it, I suspect it will give them a sense of control more so than they have now, and more confidence."
13478,Yep.
13479,Minds get made up FAST.
13480,Wow!
13481,"Have your wedding on your own property, make everyone quarantine on your own property and provide your own medical care."
13482,People are actually doing this today on boats and private islands.
13483,They have been since March.
13484,Just don't expect society to pay for your intentionally contracting/passing along a virus or any long term impacts from the illness.
13485,We don't owe you disability when it's something you inflicted on yourself.

13487,Double blind doesn't mean it's unknowable.
13488,They keep track but the participants and administrators don't know while the trials are ongoing.
13489,"Numbers are not looking good, but at least the vast majority of the population will take it seriously, follow the requirements and wear masks when they are asked to."
13490,But ‚Äúpeople‚Äù can‚Äôt have it both ways.
13491,"If they had acted responsibly to start with, we wouldn‚Äôt be in this mess."
13492,I‚Äôm sick and tired of dumbass people who rely on their Facebook feed for medical advice.
13493,"I‚Äôm sick and tired of people who think wearing a mask is an assault on their freedom, but who stop when the light turns red, and wear shoes and a shirt in the grocery story."
13494,I‚Äôm sick and tired of idiots who think Fauci is making money off this.
13495,"I‚Äôm sick and tired of dimwits who think politician somehow enjoy grinding the economy to a halt, when their enjoyment of owning the libtards is what is keeping us from getting back to normal."
13496,"COVID won't disappear, the government just won't do anything."
13497,An intelligent populace would have caught on to this advice oh...about 6 months ago.
13498,How many people do you believe are allergic to saltwater?
13499,You clearly have no idea what you are talking about.
13500,It depends on what the consequences of the positive are.
13501,I would be pretty miffed if I was kicked off my flight and forced to quarantine for a false positive.
13502,I think the earlier we realize that the current trend is not sustainable the shorter and softer the lockdown can be.
13503,I just fear we are in a much more dire situation now than in spring because its literally surging all over the country not only in the southwest.
13504,If I remember right Pfizer is ahead on the vaccine compared to others.
13505,I wanted to say it's not unusual or frowned upon.
13506,"People wear them when they are sick, right?"
13507,I would like we adopted a similar aproach in the west and not go totaly anti-mask the second there is vaccine.
13508,"Cuz they do it by sniffing your a$$ , that‚Äôs why!......"
13509,Grocery stores doesn't confined you in a small space with people around you breathing the same air as you for a long period of time.
13510,"But yes, if you are continue staying in the grocery store without wearing masks and goggles, then you are asking for it."
13511,There are already some cases coming out from the malls and other public places.
13512,"While getting food so you don't starve to death can be considered essential for reasonable people, going to grocery store cannot be compared to going to an airplane."
13513,"There's so much information out there - both accurate and inaccurate - so one way to stay on top of things is to design your own ""media diet."""
13514,"This could be, for example, a habit where you spend 30 minutes in the morning, and maybe another 30 minutes in the evening, catching up on the latest developments about Covid-19."
13515,"Also part of this ""diet"" is choosing which outlets you're going to spend your precious time with."
13516,"Maybe you decide you'll check out the WHO's website for 10 mins for alerts, and then 15 minutes on the New York Times website, plus some time on a local news outlet."
13517,"This way you're getting a varied diet that meets your information needs, and by dedicating this time in the am and pm, you avoid trying to on top of the news all throughout the day."
13518,"15 k is bad, but 15k with 177k tests, is not as bad as the numbers we had in march/April, which were lower , but we also made significantly less tests

Also the numbers we had in march were mostly in a couple of regions, these are spread throughout the whole territory, which in a way is scarier, but it's also easier to manage

I'm not saying ""everything is fine"", I'm just saying a number alone doesn't mean anything, there are multiple factors in play

PS: glad to see Reddit is always ready to downvote someone expressing an opinion"
13519,Since your better.
13520,It hasn't even been a month and this virus is sneaky.
13521,Americans think that Eastern Europe is a whites-only third reich.
13522,It will be important to get approval in children so that schools can open and we don't get transmission through kids.
13523,"I am also from Canada and it blows my mind that people think we are ""doing good""."
13524,Canada is a disaster just like Europe and the USA.
13525,But how the things are going here in Europe i wonder if there's one person at risk still alive to receive it
13526,Cases in Canada aren't growing.
13527,They have stabilized on a high level.
13528,"Assuming ethics protocols were followed (I can't imagne they weren't), they would have been fully informed."
13529,"The whole point of double-blind studies is that no-one, researchers or paticipants, knows what they received."
13530,"Records are linked to patients only as needed - at the end of the study, or for adverse cases like this."
13531,This is all standard practice.
13532,"For an example of unethical behaviour, lookup Tuskegee."
13533,Situations like this drove modern ethics.
13534,"Whoa, whoa, whoa, I thought Canada was doing everything perfect."
13535,Normalized consumption behaviors and a established food culture.
13536,[removed]
13537,&gt; Not always.
13538,1st stage Human trials often don't include a placebo group.
13539,This is stage 3.
13540,"For vaccines, they always include a placebo group
  
&gt; It's being given to people who are on deaths door already
   
I think you're confusing treatments with vaccines."
13541,They only go to healthy people
13542,"Ah, sniffing things!"
13543,Another pleasure made impossible by social distancing.
13544,"Oh really, look up age demographics and obesity
 Think the country would function with 60-80% staying home?"
13545,"Hey, North Dakota: Don't sweat it too badly."
13546,Florida here.
13547,"We were once being called the ""Wuhan of the Pandemic,"" and we're \*just fine\* now."
13548,Thanks for this question and raising the issue of Covid-19 in correctional facilities - it's a big problem with some very big repercussions for communities as a whole.
13549,Before jumping in to offering advice or presenting people with the facts (which we scientists love to do!)
13550,it's useful to take a step back and ask some questions of the people you want to communicate with.
13551,That's because it's not that they don't know the facts - they've likely heard that studies show masks save lives.
13552,"So start by asking what they've heard, and why they choose not to follow the evidence-based guidance."
13553,That way you can hear them out and tailor your messaging specifically to their concerns and information needs.
13554,Does that mean you aren‚Äôt seeing any family members for the holidays?
13555,Because the news has you a scared little sheep.
13556,I mean you care for your family*.
13557,"&gt;So because you're miserable, you want people to be just as miserable as you are?"
13558,"Yeah ok, makes sense..

No."
13559,That is not what I said.
13560,Please do not resort to logical fallacies.
13561,"I was accused of ""not understanding the social and economic consequences"" when I had already made it extraordinarily clear that I do understand them."
13562,&gt;The rest of us are going to assess risk and live our lives accordingly.
13563,Unfortunately a huge percentage of the population is objectively unfit to make that assessment.
13564,"They are not social distancing, they are attending indoor social gatherings without adequate ventilation and airflow, they are not wearing masks, they are not properly washing their hands."
13565,"&gt;If you haven't had any human contact in 7 months then thats on you, brother

No, it's not."
13566,It's on the people who have made it impossible for me to safely be around others.
13567,If I was in New Zealand this wouldn't be a problem.
13568,"I would have had closer-to-normal social interactions if people had starting wearing masks when they had been told to, if they had started social distancing when they had been told to, if the government had provided regular and continued financial assistance, if quick and reliable testing had been made cheaply and easily available."
13569,"Can't read the article, Europe laws aren't keen on this site."
13570,It has a message that says due to some laws on Europe we can't let you in
13571,Whoa they started already?
13572,Yeah just start adopting them out of full shelters and training them up.
13573,we have an overpopulation this would be the best thing ever
13574,Of course it does.
13575,"People coming into your country is a potential new source of infection, regardless how many you have already gotten."
13576,They aren't going to reach an equilibrium like some sort of disease Brownian movement.
13577,"Of course, there has never been a human vaccine for a coronavirus so I'd wager it has its own difficulties."
13578,I believe it's the 12-16 demographic.
13579,As It says 16-year-old Katelyn Evans was the first to receive the first dose in the expanded trial.
13580,Your ego literally cannot handle the words in your own study.
13581,Correct me if I'm wrong but theurupeutic methods have advanced so well that deaths won't increase.
13582,Long term effects probably but deaths are lessened thanks to new treatments
13583,Yes many places required face masks and shutting down businesses back then.
13584,"In fact WAY more strict than now, and those places that did saved tens of thousands of lives."
13585,"You are a spoiled snowflake if you think a face mask is draconian, it if you think saving lives is somehow against your freedoms."
13586,Should charge all of you people with murder.
13587,I hope they have better luck than we did.
13588,Entitled Americans couldn't live without their haircuts and their bars and restaurants for even a week.
13589,"I mean if you're living in a world of black and white, which is either ""back to normal"" or ""sitting on asses forever"" I can see why my comment would make you angry enough to use a verbal attack."
13590,If I thought those were my only two options I'd be mad too.
13591,I don‚Äôt see your point.
13592,Nevertheless I was thinking of Eli Lilly.
13593,"No briefing today, I add notes on the changes in the numbers or other relevant news on the other days."
13594,Shiiit
13595,I also developed Narcolepsy at 15 years of age after having Mono!
13596,Been feeling concerned the same way about Covid-19 with how many people are going to have N activated...
13597,I'm sure masks work.
13598,"But tell me, how do you enforce the hundreds of passengers all wear their masks?"
13599,How about when they eat?
13600,When they use a vomit bag?
13601,"Or, how about when the lights go dim, passengers are sleeping, and now, you decide to take your mask off under your blanket (which the person behind you, next to you, and down the aisle have already done)."
13602,The only way I feel safe flying on a plane in this climate is to have a clean suit on me the whole time.
13603,Trust me...
13604,The ONLY color hospitals see is GREEN üí∞
13605,I hope by less stringent it means - masks and distancing in literally the *only* place you have to go if you‚Äôre terrified of the vaccine - the grocery store &amp; pharmacy.
13606,"Then, the rest of us can go back to living."
13607,"This is important for health providers to know and the public to be aware of, but we need to avoid any perception of political influence with these announcements."
13608,"If it's truly bad and requires immediate redress, then go ham on reporting, otherwise it may be best to limit these announcements so we don't even approach the same zip code of appearing sensational or trying to influence the election."
13609,The right especially needs to keep this in mind in the other direction by not going crazy reporting every time the numbers dip below some threshold.
13610,"I know the right won't follow that advice, but it would seriously behoove them to not downplay the seriousness of this pandemic as much as it's in the left's best interests to not sensationalize this pandemic."
13611,"Neither extreme does the scientists fighting this thing any good, it just erodes the public's faith in evidence collection and data analysis."
13612,Yes we know you don‚Äôt care about dead people.
13613,That‚Äôs why the US is one of the worse off countries right now.
13614,Looking the Poland graph of recorded cases here in Finland has been quite interesting.
13615,Along the year I paid attention to Poland as a country that had difficulties pulling the numbers down.
13616,The same wave kept going on and the country constantly hovered at around 300 cases.
13617,But the development in the last few weeks is just something next level.
13618,"""We have a lift-off!"""
13619,These guys are going straight to the moon.
13620,"Hi, I've battled insomnia all my life as well."

13622,"I'm not suggesting that you need or should want to do anything different than you do, but, if you're interested, it was lurking in r/C25K that started me on this path."
13623,"no, they have fuck you money"
13624,You absolutely are living in a fantasy world.
13625,"It‚Äôs got to inform people of how vaccination works, but the world isn‚Äôt going to continue sitting in their asses forever"
13626,"&gt;a worst-case scenario circlejerk

Are you new here?"
13627,There's a lot we don't know still.
13628,I don't think we can say exactly how it's going to look.
13629,Liberty and rights are never absolute.
13630,Most if not all rights have limits imposed to avoid morons over-using their rights negatively impacting others

13637,Of course.

13639,"Don‚Äôt worry, all the selfish people will be celebrating New Year‚Äôs Eve in droves so the spring will be equally awful"
13640,"Go out for essentials only, obvi."
13641,"But I see people going out to restaurants, bars, leisure shopping, nail appointments, lip filler appointments, partying on yachts, throwing house parties, clubbing, going to sporting events, traveling for fun, staying at hotels, going to Disney world, like WTF."
13642,STAY YA ASS AT HOME.
13643,Well this is ironic
13644,"So, which countries still use it?"
13645,What isn‚Äôt allowed to be open?
13646,Even if people were wearing masks more it wouldn‚Äôt just make that need magically disappear in 2022.
13647,It‚Äôs basically impossible to keep levels low unless almost everyone is following guidelines completely forever.

13656,"I always wonder how people manage to get themselves in like 30,000 in credit card debt while being the newest phones or taking vacations."
13657,I guess it's the same attitude of detaching yourself from reality and burying your head as deep in the sand as you can.
13658,"Here's the latest case/death charts for Oklahoma, with running 7-day averages:

13660,"So i go into a lot of healthcare facilities that are university, non-for profit, government controlled, and for profit."
13661,"These would be nursing homes, hospitals, and of course smaller clinical."
13662,"The for-profit ones are typically representative of the worst of the mix, followed by government ones, and the non-for-profit organizations are the best."
13663,"If we're talking specifically about elderly care, for-profit is the bulk of these homes but it's also the widest range of inequality."
13664,You have everything from luxury retirement communities to rough skilled nursing facilities where people are basically wasting away in a shared bedroom for their final years.
13665,The for-profit healthcare facility looks at the minimum they're required to provide along with the money provided from the Medicaid as the equation on how to make money out of it.
13666,It's the sad reality that also really doesn't have a great solution.
13667,"Looking at European estimates of elderly care rates, they're not too far off United States rates, which is actually fairly surprising to me considering how much of a lower cost health care is in Europe as a whole."
13668,They're also running to the same problem where our retirement population represents a much higher proportion of the total population.
13669,"What problems they don't have, however, is an increased bankruptcy rate caused by healthcare costs."
13670,The most ideal solution is just simply not needing working society to front any costs for non-workers.

13717,"If anything, criticism should be aimed at how every single Western Government wasted the time that lockdown bought so now you have two horrible outcomes: lockdown related deaths (and poverty + mental health issues) AND a lack of an efficient tracing system which will lead to stupid politicians doing a 2nd harsher lockdown (which will also fail)."

13797,"The problem is that with millions of infections, the 20% who get seriously ill becomes a huge number."

13850,"&gt; It's honestly shocking that anyone, at any point in time, fully expected this to 'go away'."
13851,"The US President has consistently told the public that this will go away, and he still holds to that message to this day."
13852,Even without a vaccine.
13853,Will everyone follow this guideline though?
13854,Surely people can think for themselves and not follow everything the government says.
13855,The vaccines are in development.
13856,It‚Äôs as fast as any vaccines ever developed.
13857,Deployment will be a bear.
13858,Just assume you won‚Äôt get the vaccine until September next year.
13859,Treatment improvements will come slowly.
13860,This is a virus.
13861,There are very few antivirals and those that do exist took decades to develop.
13862,This thing will be in the human population for a very long time.
13863,We are going to have to learn to live with it and still continue our daily lives.
13864,Right now that should mean social distancing and wearing a mask.
13865,Hopefully next year it will be a little more open.
13866,"The same reason people remove masks to talk so the other person 'can hear them better', people are dumb."
13867,"Let me put it this way:

Only a small percentage have been infected a single time."
13868,"If 5% of people have been infected once, then even if every single one of the CAN be reinfected, then it would only be 5% of that 5% that are reinfected."
13869,"So we would start off with only a small fraction of the total infections that would be reinfected, even if there was zero immunity."
13870,"Meanwhile, we are barely testing anybody for reinfections, and even throwing out any that are of the same strain."
13871,"In other words, there's a massive undercount of reinfections."
13872,"SO we have a fraction of total first cases that would be reinfections even without immunity to start with, combined with a massive undercount of actual reinfections."
13873,And all that is with ZERO immunity.
13874,"Which is incredibly unlikely (it's more on a spectrum of course, with more and more people losing immunity over time)."
13875,Do you see now why your original comment was so wrong?
13876,I wonder if it could even be a flare up of the original infection.
13877,I like how you worded that.
13878,It doesn't have to be all or nothing with lockdowns or normal life.
13879,Florida has not be a model example of COVID response but we never had any lockdowns over the summer and got cases to go down for a while.
13880,That‚Äôs bull Stitt.
13881,Worst governor ever.
13882,"Also, a small number of reinfections is unfortunately not necessarily good news."
13883,The reason is that the joint probability of catching covid two times  (just from simple statistics) is much much lower at early stages than catching it only once.
13884,If these cases start popping up then we either will need a vaccine or seriously consider finding ways to erradicate this thing.
13885,Interesting article by the Harvard Business Review.
13886,"These elastomeric N95 masks seem very promising, are more reusable, and could help compensate for the massive and unacceptable shortage of normal N95 masks."
13887,Our government and other institutions should take heed to its advice!

13889,If you're not worried about getting covid then you probably aren't worried about giving it.
13890,I don‚Äôt think Moderna is doing any challenge trials.
13891,They are not common due to serious ethical concerns and are only being considered due to the time sensitive situation we all find ourselves in.
13892,The 1918 flu mutated into a much less deadly virus.
13893,"COVID probably won't, because it's not deadly enough."
13894,"Had a really good friend die of OD a month back, RIP Nicky."
13895,"I'll say this about him, the dude knew he was going to kill himself and he still wore his mask on the day he died what so whats everyone else's excuse?"
13896,I‚Äôm with you there.
13897,"Our President is a fuckwad and if he had led with direction in the early stages, we could probably be in a good spot."
13898,Unfortunately he did not and the virus is here.
13899,I firmly believe that the virus is here to stay and licking down until we reach zero cases isn‚Äôt feasible.
13900,"Maybe in January, but not anymore."
13901,"My opinion is that the lockdowns should be relaxed, masks and social distancing should be STRONGLY enforced, and people should be given guidelines to assess their own personal level of risk and how to react accordingly."
13902,But these dipshits spread it around.
13903,They‚Äôll kill us all.
13904,We could build a boat and row out of here.

13968,We are able to confirm only a tiny fraction of reinfections.
13969,According to [GISAID](https://www.gisaid.org) virus samples from about 151 thousand COVID-19 infections have been sequenced so far (out of ~40.6 million confirmed infections to date).
13970,So the pool of patients for whom a ‚Äòconfirmed‚Äô reinfection is possible (for whom a sequence of their initial infection - which is required to confirm reinfection - exists) is likely to be smaller (perhaps significantly smaller) than 151 thousand.
13971,I linked that article you're talking about and I'm sure I'll still get downvoted.
13972,"I don't live in a country with strict lockdowns or anything (quite the opposite actually) but our subreddit is full of ""everyone who goes out is a murderer"", ""we should have a lockdown till 2023"" and ""immunity doesn't exist"" people who will downvote science if it doesn't support what they think and ever since the first cases of reinfections came out they've been saying we should still stay home forever cause that means immunity isn't real at all."
13973,"Of course, as an academic this kind of scenarios are useful."
13974,"However, I think it can send the wrong message."
13975,"It may become endemic, so people will think: let's just forget about it (what many do anyway)."
13976,"in other words, they'll use a highly speculative message as justification for not adapting."

13980,I'd much rather wear a mask than a ventilator.
13981,"I mean, like an actual accurate number."
13982,I‚Äôve looked into that number and it‚Äôs data is flawed.
13983,Is there a more accurate data set?

13989,I know it‚Äôs done academically; when the need arises.
13990,It‚Äôs not something done on every case which would be pointless if we assume most people being tested have had no prior infection.

14004,Im saying it‚Äôs more realistic to get that 0.01% of severely at risk population to self-quarantine than to shut down the entire world for long enough to completely eradicate a virus that we know little about and that seems to be less dangerous to more and more people with every day that goes by.
14005,"The changes in quality of life people are experiencing range from not being able to go to gatherings/bars/restaurants (minor impact, I know), to losing their job/career/business and not being able to earn a living or having to start over from square one in a different field."

14043,Next year we'll have cheap fast paper tests everywhere which will put even more pressure on it to become milder.

14069,Well to be fair the numbers for COVID are closer to 0.01-0.02%.
14070,"I mentioned not downplaying COVID-19 for a reason, it isn't near black death levels of fatal, but still a historic pandemic."
14071,Edit - 0.01% is not IFR but percentage of population killed by COVID-19 based on 1 million deaths vs population of 8 billion people so it is a low ball estimate both for 1 million deaths being an undercount (undiagnosed deaths etc) and 8 billion being larger than the estimated current population size.

Just accepting deaths as normal is really stupid."

14092,That's why we have so many deaths.

14156,You can be part of the problem or part of the solution.
14157,I really don't see what the big deal is.
14158,The car analogy has nothing to do with licenses or permission.
14159,"People compare it to driving a car because it's a high-risk activity that most people do, where you need to depend on others to do the right thing too, and that can be modified in simple ways to make it safer (like wearing a seatbelt as I and so many others have mentioned)."
14160,"Right now I trust most drivers because I see people driving safe the majority of the time I'm on the road, so I feel safe enough to drive a car."
14161,"But if I started noticing a lot of people driving dangerously, I would probably not want to risk it anymore - even though less than 1% of car accidents are fatal."
14162,And I would be pissed about it because those people would be risking my safety and the safety of others.

14230,"If you don‚Äôt have symptoms, or don‚Äôt seek treatment, you aren‚Äôt captured."
14231,My point was that we cannot draw a conclusion because of that very reason.
14232,"It‚Äôs the same reason we may be missing reinfections that were asymptomatic the first time, which therefore would mask the potential that reinfection is worse."
14233,Not enough data.

14275,"Much of the ""gains"" are from there."
14276,2.
14277,A lot of people who weren't quite billionaires or lost their billionaire status gained it due the stock market's recovery.
14278,In 2019 there were 705 billionaires in the US.
14279,Right after the March crashes it had dropped to 614.
14280,Let's look at the Forbes 400 for October 2019 and October 2020 to get a better idea of how much wealth was gained by the billionaire group.
14281,Focusing on just the top 400 prevents spoiling our conclusion by having more people added to the list.
14282,"It's a static 400 (though the exact people mix did change):

In October 2019, the top 400 billionaires were worth [$2.96 trillion USD."

14286,But even this doesn't tell the whole picture.
14287,October 2019 wasn't the peak wealth for this group.
14288,The stock market still went up another 4 months until it crashed in late February.

14613,what's the point of going back to school now anyways I would have to do zoom in the classroom like what's the point.
14614,I get some kids both parents have to work.
14615,But I mean me I wouldn't go I've stayed inside for 4 months I'm not going to school to get covid not be able to talk to friends have to do zoom and have to wear a mask for 6 hours.
14616,The doctor is the right person to help.
14617,"If the symptoms subside you're probably in the clear, though."
14618,99.9% of people your age w/o co-morbidities recover from COVID if you have it.
14619,"Hobby stores, movie theaters, clothing retailers, shoe stores, comic book shops, bookstores... 

That seems to be about it."
14620,I thought he was protected by God.
14621,"Sure, let‚Äôs give it to everyone around them and kill off a few more family members to join them."
14622,Good idea.
14623,Thanks for posting this link.
14624,I couldn't read the regular one due to paywall.
14625,Checked my bill of rights.
14626,No word about the pandemic.
14627,Agree.
14628,"People are terribly mislead by tv about death, CPR, etc."
14629,"I can‚Äôt tell you how many times I‚Äôve taken care of someone critically ill needing intubation and/or CPR and people ask ‚Äúare they going to need to stay in the hospital overnight.‚Äù I‚Äôm extremely blunt when I meet the family and explain that they‚Äôre on a machine to breath for them, requiring medication to keep their blood pressure up, whatever."
14630,This is all pre-covid and it‚Äôs so much worse now.
14631,Since most places do not allow visitation families don‚Äôt see their loved one so they don‚Äôt understand how sick they actually are.
14632,I‚Äôve been called the ‚Äúqueen of the DNR‚Äù by colleagues because I‚Äôm pretty good at talking to family about end of life issues and getting them to understand that CPR sometimes prolongs suffering in certain cases.
14633,"Thus, they‚Äôre made ‚Äúdo not resuscitate.‚Äù This does not mean we don‚Äôt treat, it just means that if they lose a pulse we allow them to pass peacefully without the trauma of CPR."
14634,I‚Äôve had no luck doing this via phone because people are just unaware of how sick their loved one is.
14635,Telling someone that your family member‚Äôs pH is 6.6 and on 5 pressors just doesn‚Äôt compute.
14636,"And it‚Äôs not necessarily their fault, it‚Äôs just so much easier with visitation."
14637,At my home hospital I break that rule all the time when someone is actively dying.
14638,But another hospital I worked at was super strict and I didn‚Äôt have the clout to go against admin as I do at my home hospital.
14639,"7.6 million doses per day... ~7.6 billion people (quick mafs)... ~1000 days... ~3 years from release until vaccines are globally distributed, assuming they maintain that momentum."
14640,Herd immunity may be closer to 2 years.
14641,That's still a pretty long time.
14642,Here's to hoping more companies are able to get in on the game with their own vaccines - I'd love to not have too think about this at all by 2022.
14643,The data: https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/country/czech-republic/
14644,"Hospitals, nursing homes, fire, police, medical facilities, utilities all essential."
14645,And all the businesses needed to keep those running.
14646,"Obviously we could have closed more things down, but a huge percentage of the workforce is legitimately essential and they would inevitably harbor and spread virus."
14647,How about the paper plant in my town that makes Toilet paper and employs a huge percentage of people.
14648,You want that closed?
14649,I know because clearly I am smarter than you.
14650,You live in a fantasy world.
14651,Hospitals are actually laying off staff.
14652,They don't make money treating corona.
14653,All the elective surgeries that make the money have been put on the back burner.
14654,Is it really?
14655,"I've never heard of it before this post, which is where the ignorance part comes in."
14656,I guess I haven't heard too much about burden of disease before Covid though.
14657,"Either way, I still think its a silly way to determine the severity  of a disease."
14658,It just seems like extra unnecessary information.
14659,"Like when a football commentator comes out with some weird stat like ""this is the seventh game in a row he's thrown 3 touchdowns which puts him ranked 34th of all time in that category"""
14660,"It looks like there around 24,000 excess deaths in that age group (trying to find that actual source for that in the CDC data), 5,700 have been counted as COVID in that age group from CDC as well."
14661,I can't imagine that gap can be filled by uncounted COVID deaths or even remotely close.
14662,"That's a very large number though, we should have some sort of hint at what is happening."
14663,*Former* chairman?
14664,One hardline opinion?
14665,One single news source I have never heard of before that runs on clicks and add revenue?
14666,Fear mongering?
14667,"Has all the ingredients to be a #1 hit on r/coronavirus

14668,So no beer ?
14669,"If you don't have the data then you don't have the data, peace."
14670,What's causing such a large spike?
14671,Whole Foods?
14672,of course.

14678,Herd immunity is a viable strategy with a vaccine.
14679,"There is no way 100% of people can, or even will, get a vaccine, so the hope there is enough get it to achieve herd immunity."
14680,Herd immunity for covid without a vaccine is completely stupid.
14681,"It's just great that he gets paid tens of millions of dollars to promote lies and conspiracy theories that, in this case, are helping kill thousands of people."
14682,"There is no correlation between mask mandates and cases stagnating or declining, nor correlation between no masks and cases rising."
14683,"Apparently, most people get infected at work where masks are mandated."
14684,Haven't you been listening to the Trump administration?
14685,It ended on April 1.
14686,"the joke &lt;----------------------------------------&gt; you 

loving the social distance"
14687,What a surprise
14688,So most Americans...
14689,Don't worry about it.
14690,It's just propaganda.
14691,My family in Poland are among the people who think Covid is fake.
14692,TBH I don't see a big difference between the situation in Poland and the situation in midwest states.
14693,I have not been this confused and startled in at least 72 hours...
14694,"Plot twist, your grandma texts YOU and says she is COVID positive and not to come over -- she's been kissing guys at bars, for example last Friday, and thinks that's how she could have gotten it."
14695,&gt; And most of the country hasn't even had really cold weather yet that forces everyone indoors for several months (especially North and Midwest)!
14696,"We're already talking about snow here in KC next week, which is awefully early for us."
14697,Cold weather here in the midwest is very quickly approaching.
14698,"Granted we often get our first freeze late October / early November, the cloudier and cooler weather is already enough to move more people inside."
14699,Edited for clarity.
14700,There is literally a bar in my grocery and people drink there with mask off.
14701,Don‚Äôt worry college is just the beginning of the fun
14702,So did we just solve the under/overcount debate in favor of overcounting?
14703,And those numbers are fake.
14704,I remember reading that their excess death rates are the worst in the world
14705,"As long as there‚Äôs a pandemic going on, no one is free."
14706,Why is that so hard to understand?
14707,I have a feeling the other defining characteristic of super spreaders is that they avoid being tested so...
14708,[removed]
14709,&gt;It‚Äôs blamed on fall vacation.
14710,Number of tests were falling already before the school vacation (week 42).
14711,It was primarily tests of asymptomatic people that dropped sharply in that week.
14712,[removed]
14713,Who‚Äôs going to tell them people don‚Äôt care?
14714,"Once there‚Äôs a vaccine, most of us are going right back to living normally."
14715,No reason to social distance when there‚Äôs no virus.
14716,This!!
14717,Wtf?!?
14718,"The government is literally lying and misinforming the population, but hey, gyms are open!!"
14719,!
14720,"Is this post is satire, then it does an absolutely brilliant job of mocking the attitudes we typically see on reddit, and deserves thousands of upvotes."
14721,"If it's serious, then I regret to tell you that this is a very unscientific attitude to have."
14722,Lol they blame it on church's.
14723,But people are going to bars now.
14724,Its not that i dont think virtual church is not ok its that people are blaming it on church's and not all the other things.
14725,"If he was tested positive for killer piss, no."
14726,"Otherwise, yes."
14727,And of course he can walk around without pants if he wants to.
14728,"He's home, isn't he?"
14729,What am I missing?
14730,This is pretty much everything...
14731,"I hope ""film your hospital"" gang is now actively volunteering with the front line workers."
14732,"It's not exactly the government's fault, or poor health care system's."
14733,People are idiots.
14734,"I spent July and August over there and I could not believe the levels of carelessness, stubbornness and ignorance."
14735,People were having parties and laughing out loud about covid.
14736,Lots of them also believed (maybe still do) various conspiracy theories and that covid is not a real thing.
14737,"And btw, my friends organized a birthday party this weekend."
14738,"Yes, this fucking weekend when record numbers of infections were being diagnosed!"
14739,They did it on a beach.
14740,Why?
14741,Because apparently it's still allowed to congregate outside.
14742,"So people will look for any way to skip the rules, just for a stupid birthday party, no matter that one among may be giving them a potentially lethal disease!"
14743,So there you have it - the results of summer and stupidity.
14744,You can absolutely leave your house lol.
14745,"In my city, stores are open, including art stores, clothing stores, and other hobby stores, beaches and parks are available, and you can eat outdoors restaurants (and given that it‚Äôs been in the 80s-90s for the last few weeks, I imagine it will stay that way for a while)."
14746,"Now, I only take advantage of the parks and beaches because I don‚Äôt really feel safe indoors or around a bunch of people with their masks off, but that‚Äôs a choice that I am making."
14747,Did you go to the same fancy private school?
14748,"At free public schools, even the virtual ones, they teach the difference between your and you're."
14749,"If you care about those kids, you would spend the tuition money on helping or volunteering at organizations that help kids whose parents are working."
14750,"Your fake concern is just a tool for you to shit on teachers, who are working more hours than ever."
14751,Low standard of hospit care in Poland...?
14752,You comment is seriously throwing me.
14753,Don't you guys have one of the best Healthcare in the world?
14754,"Or do all the ""europeans"" on reddit just use the nordic countries as examples and none of you actually have Healthcare like the Nordic countries do....?"
14755,I'm seriously asking here.
14756,Depends on what you want to compare.
14757,I have the gut feeling that the whole field of statistics was originally invented to take hard data and massage it until it fits into your preferred narrative.
14758,"(Unfortunately, I have not yet found the time to massage existing hard data enough to back up that claim.)"
14759,"If you wished to feed the Conservative narrative, you could also count 14 days of country-wide lockdowns as 14 days of life lost for everyone, and compare them to on average 3 days of life lost for everyone due to the virus until now (with a total disregard for the much higher number of lives and days lost had the virus spread even more uncontrolled than it already did, of course)."
14760,"Too many things to take into consideration there for any of these numbers to be really useful except as a flimsy reason for one view or another, but at least we have numbers."
14761,Considering the infectious bile comes out of his mouth every time he opens it...
14762,That CDC figure is obviously in error (disagrees with its own 7-day case figure).
14763,Good catch!
14764,"It would be the correct figure for 7 day rolling average, using a rectangular window (i.e., divide by 7)."
14765,But that's clearly not what the text description says.
14766,"Last I heard, someone correct me if this is outdated information, there have been a small number of cases where humans transmitted the virus to pets, and 0 cases where animals transmitted it to people"
14767,Because the US is too individualistic.
14768,"It‚Äôs all about MY rights, I‚Äôm not doing anything I don‚Äôt want to, etc."
14769,"Also, millions of people in Asia have been wearing masks for years."
14770,People may think ‚Äúthird world‚Äù countries like Vietnam and Thailand would falter during a time like this but it‚Äôs clearly the U.S. that‚Äôs regressing in civility.
14771,"Not to mention, healthcare is more affordable in SE Asia than almost anywhere in the US."
14772,I'm so sorry.
14773,We in America.
14774,That information is readily available and shoved directly in our faces if you pay attention at all to news or politics or even this sub.
14775,"Its good to be informed, but again doing it this way is just to elicit emotional reactions from otherwise intelligent readers."
14776,I just got invited to a costume BBQ at a bar.
14777,I couldn't believe it.
14778,I know a lot of my local cases are likely from out of state as i live in northern ky and we get a lot of travel from ohio.
14779,Stuff is scary.
14780,I did go to a wedding but it was outside and reception was in an open barn .
14781,Even then people weren't wearing masks even though they had signs everywhere.
14782,And people were supposed to stay seated while wait staff distributed food but people kept going up.
14783,Idk what its like where you are.
14784,But more and more people seem to be resisting.
14785,"Not as much as right at the beginning, but more than a few months ago."
14786,Next fall is a pretty safe bet for true normalcy but will probably starting seeing that again in Spring 2021
14787,"wow, straight to wishing death upon my parents, what a high class citizen."
14788,Gain our freedom?
14789,We already are free.
14790,"Or were until today, sort of."
14791,"So to gain it, we have to lose it in first place."
14792,What about not losing it and then not having to gain it again?
14793,"I have a feeling after the election, a lot of folks will stop instinctively politicizing things and reopening plans will gain momentum."
14794,The discrepancy is likely related at least in part to starting points.
14795,NY started with a lower case count than Wisconsin and they also had had a pretty rough run at the beginning of the pandemic.
14796,"It takes a while for the virus to spin up, and it takes even longer if some portion of the population has some kind of immunity (whether temporary or permanent)."
14797,"There's also likely a ""social immunity"" factor, where because NY was hit more aggressively at the outset, New Yorkers are more likely to have adopted habits that keep themselves safe."
14798,finally people are trusting science people used to be like OhH tHE VaCCiNe WiLL mAkE You dIE.
14799,like come on 30k people are getting the test and not on has any serious problems.
14800,Agreed.
14801,"It‚Äôs even worse when non-science news sites pick them up, spin them, and create even more fear."

14819,"Hard to take it seriously when the Trump administration says it's no big deal, and models behavior that contradicts all sane advice-- hosting superspreader events, no masks, no social distancing, even claiming that it's no more dangerous than the common cold."
14820,NY put out a report saying they are shocked by how few people have been getting sick from schools .

14875,The only thing we know right now is that immunity probably isn‚Äôt permanent.
14876,We don‚Äôt have any idea what an average duration is and how it varies with demographics and phenotypes.
14877,"The term has been around for some time, but you are mistaken about the origins."
14878,&gt;How did herd immunity enter the language of public health?
14879,The phrase seems to have first appeared in the work of American livestock veterinarians concerned about ‚Äúcontagious abortion‚Äù‚Äîepidemics of spontaneous miscarriage‚Äîin cattle and sheep.
14880,"By the 1910s, it had become the leading contagious threat to cattle in the USA."
14881,Farmers destroyed or sold affected cows.
14882,Kansas veterinarian George Potter realised that this was the wrong approach.
14883,"Writing with Adolph Eichhorn in 1916 in the Journal of the American Veterinary Medical Association, he envisioned ‚Äúherd immunity‚Äù."
14884,"As he wrote in 1918, ‚ÄúAbortion disease may be likened to a fire, which, if new fuel is not constantly added, soon dies down."
14885,"Herd immunity is developed, therefore, by retaining the immune cows, raising the calves, and avoiding the introduction of foreign cattle.‚Äù

https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(20)31924-3/fulltext


But really, the use of herd is a great signifier that we didn't start using the term for humans as we don't call groups of humans herds."
14886,Even the first usage by a biologist referred to mice not humans.
14887,"&gt;In The Lancet in July, 1919, bacteriologist W W C Topley described experimental epidemics he created in groups of mice."
14888,"Unless there was a steady influx of susceptible mice, the rising prevalence of immune individuals would end an epidemic."
14889,"In a 1923 article in the Journal of Hygiene, he and G S Wilson described this phenomenon as ‚Äúherd immunity‚Äù."
14890,"https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(20)31924-3/fulltext

Fwiw, I do agree that it isn't too important that it's herd immunity, the problem is that without a vaccine it requires a huge number of dead."

‚ÄúPolis on Tuesday announced a new ad campaign, called ‚ÄúStep Up, Colorado,‚Äù encouraging Coloradans to wear masks and adhere to social distancing guidelines."
14916,"He declined to speculate on when ‚Äî or whether ‚Äî he may take statewide action to slow the spread of the disease, instead making it clear that he sees a local approach as the remedy for Colorado‚Äôs increasing cases and hospitalizations."

14918,"‚Äú‚Ä¶ There‚Äôs different measures at different times in different places depending on the conditions.‚Äù 

Polis pointed to Boulder County‚Äôs success last month at quashing an outbreak of COVID-19 tied to the University of Colorado."
14919,"The current spike in cases, however, is being driven by a number of counties simultaneously, including Denver, Arapahoe, Adams, Pueblo and Mesa counties."
14920,"In fact, the majority of Colorado‚Äôs 64 counties have reported a ‚Äúvery high‚Äù incidence of coronavirus over the past two weeks of more than 100 new coronavirus cases per 100,000 people.‚Äù"

14934,they‚Äôre not; they‚Äôre the last line.
14935,the front line is *personal responsibility* and too few people are taking it.
14936,"instead, they‚Äôre fucking around and finding out and our overworked and undersupported healthcare workers who, despite beliefs to the contrary, did not sign up for this are being tasked with picking up that slack."
14937,"they signed up to help people in need, but the other part of the contract is that we ‚Äî the public ‚Äî do everything we reasonably can to avoid needing help."

Seems like he's talking about Europe as a whole for worst-case scenario projections if there are more no precautionary measures taken and/or current ones loosened."
14952,"But then even basic measures like universal mask wearing, no mass gatherings, widespread test and trace, etc would drastically mitigate that projected death toll."

14965,Remember that r0 is an average.
14966,Covid is unusual in that it has a very small k factor which means how variable it's spread it is.
14967,It's likely due to it having a very narrow window of infectivity.
14968,To me this suggests that during the infectious phase covid r0 could be as higher or higher than measles.

15023,Respiratory illness is no joke.
15024,I had pneumonia about three years ago caused by strep bacteria of all things.
15025,Shortly after recovering I was diagnosed with Narcolepsy and my life changed forever.
15026,Many studies are pointing to this sort of infection as the root cause of my debilitating condition.
15027,I would strongly advise anyone to avoid an illness that has that sort of potential.
15028,1.
15029,SARS-CoV-2 has one main reproductive method.
15030,The human body.
15031,Each human is a potential Sars-CoV-2 factory.
15032,"The more humans walking around infected, the more SARS-CoV-2 is in the air, the higher the probability of infection, the stronger the epidemic."
15033,2.
15034,This coronavirus is likely seasonal with maximum infectiveness and lethality during winter.
15035,"Putting one and two together:

The last time we fought the coronavirus we started at 0 cases during the peak of winter."
15036,The weakest possible infection ( few human factories) in an environment that becomes increasingly hostile (winter-summer transition).
15037,200k Americans died.
15038,The peak of summer already passed.
15039,Now we head into coronavirus season with more than 50k new c19 factories every day.
15040,But all that matters to some is November 3rd.
15041,We haven't even put the car in gear yet.
15042,We are still bitching about having to wear a seat belt.
15043,"Its not about sugar coating, have you ever thought how that kid would feel, especially at that young age?"
15044,"Maybe he wasn't fat from eating too much and it was some other illness, you never know."
15045,Why did they not report these negative tests in the first place?
15046,I don't get it.
15047,Kind of has been that way since the 21st century.
15048,My family moved from Cali to Oregon.
15049,Pseudo-intellectual?

15055,"Under the simple no-lasting-immunity hypothesis, there will be no correlation between the different infections driven directly by the host-pathogen interaction, and the course of each infection would depend on other factors (initial viral load, overall health at that particular moment, etc.)."
15056,"Right now this is kind of what is seen, but sample sizes are small."
15057,"There is one caveat though -- even under that hypothesis one does expect over time individuals to get it worse and worse, even though the infections themselves are independent."
15058,Which is because of the internal organ damage the virus causes.
15059,"You got it once and you are relatively healthy in your 30s and 40s, you had a miserable time but was never hospitalized, but you still got some mild heart/kidney/lung/neurological/etc."
15060,damage.
15061,"Next time you get it, you are already in a somewhat compromised state, you again don't end up in the hospital, but you sustain heavier damage."
15062,And now you have more significant health issues.
15063,"Next year you get it, and you get damaged even further and now you are in the high-risk group with serious cardiovascular and other problems."
15064,Then the fourth infection sends you in the ICU.
15065,That sort of thing.
15066,"There is no relationship between the infections in terms of host-pathogen interactions, but you get worse and worse with each subsequent one."

15085,I‚Äôm disappointed.
15086,Still gotta do multiple wipes
15087,That‚Äôs just not how it works.
15088,What matters is your initial exposure.
15089,If you can keep the initial exposure down (e.g.
15090,"by properly wearing a mask, or flushing out your nasal cavity with saline immediately after a known exposure) and reduce viral load during the early stage of the infection (e.g."
15091,"by getting enough sleep, or taking some effective anti-viral meds if there were one), you can help your body‚Äôs ‚Äúinnate immune response‚Äù keep up a bit better with fighting the virus before the ‚Äúadaptive immune response‚Äù kicks in."
15092,A lower initial exposure can give your body a crucial few extra days before the amount of virus builds up to the level where it‚Äôs wrecking all of your organs.
15093,"But at the point that you have tested positive, you‚Äôre already at least 3‚Äì4 days into your infection, and the amount of virus circulating in your body is many orders of magnitude larger (thousands if not millions of times more virus) than any possible dose you could get from breathing in more."
15094,Even making out with someone who is covid positive isn‚Äôt going to make much difference at that point.
15095,"The reason covid positive people should stay home is to (a) make sure they get enough rest, and (b) avoid infecting someone else."
15096,The danger is not really that they‚Äôll be exposed more themselves.
15097,"It‚Äôs sort of like worrying about travel bans because they might stop an extra 5 or 10 infected people from entering your country, when there are already tens of thousands of infected people inside your national borders traveling around freely and your national testing strategy is so broken that you have no hope of detecting most of them."
15098,"I was thinking about this thread on my way home from work, and when I was in high school some of the ""hick"" kids hung confederate flags in their trucks."
15099,"Everyone hated it and thought it was stupid, but I don't know if they were doing it just to be controversial or if they genuinely were racist."

15123,We get common cold coronaviruses over and over again though.
15124,So hopefully a vaccine will account for this.
15125,"&amp;#x200B;

Also, this virus does go about circumventing your bodies fail safes (and maybe your immune system) in certain manners that also may complicate vaccine development."
15126,"Similar to how there still isn't a vaccine for HIV, as it is likely extremely difficult to develop one for a virus that specifically goes after your immune system."

15206,"&gt;About 300 people attended the Oct. 3 nuptials of a soap opera actor and the daughter of a businessman, Alonso Oscar P√©rez Rico, the health secretary of Baja California state said Monday."
15207,&gt;P√©rez Rico told local media that there were apparently no masks or temperature checks at the event and that the organizers also did not have permission to hold an event of that size during the pandemic.
15208,&gt;He said authorities are investigating whether anyone attended the wedding knowing they had COVID-19 or were infected by the virus.
15209,"Edit - also, *yet another* superspreader event wedding where people recklessly took no precautions."
15210,True.
15211,Agency but probably closer to $50-60/hr for the nurse.
15212,Still not bad
15213,"Yeah, that doesn't say what your post said."
15214,It would be like Africa today.
15215,Nobody really noticed lol
15216,Yes.
15217,And most of those are rhinovirus.
15218,"There's a bunch of other virus types in that number, too."
15219,We know of less than 10 coronavirus that infect humans.
15220,"SARS, SARS2, MERS and then 3-4 that cause the common cold."
15221,Check out the coronavirus (family) wiki for more details
15222,They're 1st and 2nd in deaths and 1st and fifth in cases today?
15223,It has to be under 0.3% Delta-9.

15227,/s
15228,Serious question but weren't there links to mouthwash and oral cancer a few years ago?
15229,Before declaring it an official reinfection I *think* scientists genotype the virus to confirm whether or not one person was infected two different times.
15230,Does that also mean that when a vaccine is approved we subreddit viewers are supposed to do whatever it takes to sabotage it?
15231,I don't think that would be ethical.
15232,If they find the vaccine to be efficacious you would surely have access to it.
15233,Imagine being this clueless not knowing the worldwide pandemic happened due to a massive amount of international travel and overcrowded major cities
15234,Lol
15235,"With Common cold coronaviruses, it varied how long a persons antibodies stay in their bloodstream."
15236,"For some, it was a few months."
15237,It generally takes up to 18 months for 75%+ of your antibodies to dissipate for people.
15238,But again there is a wide spectrum.
15239,PeakProsperity did a video on the study.
15240,Want to say it had \~20 people in it.
15241,It those people for 20 years.
15242,some only became infected with a common cold coronavirus a handful of times.
15243,A couple people averaged more than one per year.
15244,"My opinion, if our body treats Cov-2 like other CC coronaviruses with severity not lessening with time and staying variable."
15245,"Then, will a vaccine really work if it doesn't get our immune systems to treat this virus differently?"
15246,"If not, people will have to start taking better care of themselves."
15247,"Even if, drugs like Ivermectin are out there."
15248,"Well well well, if it isn't the consequences of our own (government) actions... 

Is this a surprise?"
15249,Pretending that something doesn't exist doesn't make it magically not exist.

15263,Considering everyone in the country is saying the election is going to be rigged (both Democrats and Republicans accusing each other) it doesn't look like a stable democracy to the rest of the world.
15264,&gt; that it is not the most dominate country in the world by almost all metrics?
15265,Health care.

15301,How does that track?

&gt;‚ÄùHow could we possibly be here again?‚Äù Clare Wenham, an assistant professor of global health policy at the London School of Economics and Political Science (LSE), asked of the UK, where the death rate from Covid-19 is among the highest in the world."

15356,"...

&gt; Yet, with few exceptions, leaders did not adequately prepare."
15357,"Instead, there was complacency and denial."
15358,"When social distancing measures slowed coronavirus spread over the summer, politicians lifted restrictions quickly in an effort to restart economies."
15359,"They then failed to heed the warnings of scientists and doctors again ‚Äî that small upticks in infections would eventually culminate in an exponential growth in cases, followed by increases in hospitalizations and deaths."
15360,"(A grim, similar pattern developed in the US.)"
15361,"...

&gt; In the absence of stricter anti-virus measures now, Hans Kluge, the World Health Organization‚Äôs regional director for Europe, warned last week, daily mortality rates from Covid-19 could reach ‚Äúlevels 4 to 5 times higher than what we recorded in April‚Äù."
15362,‚Äù And what makes this wave even more challenging than the last: People have already endured the pain of lockdowns once.

15378,I‚Äôd just like to remind anyone living in a country still with Covid in it that the coming of 2021 will not make it go away
15379,Ugh.
15380,I remember when conspiracy theorist/anti-masker Alex Jones was saying that covid was a hoax in June because Florida cases were skyrocketing but the deaths were declining.
15381,"He either didn't understand that people don't die the same day that they get infected, or he knew that and he intentionally lied to people to push his agenda."

15388,AND it's profitable here- private insurance companies will charge for each dose.
15389,First off this is a throwaway account because I actually work at the hospital in the article.
15390,"Secondly What truly pisses me off is how Matt Heywood will step up and say how hard we‚Äôre all work to try and keep our community safe and healthy, which trust me we are, I miss spending time with my family because I‚Äôm having to work so many additional hours to make up for the people who were furloughed."
15391,And yes they have brought them(furloughed employees) back but after being gone for a few months it‚Äôs like having to train a whole new staff.
15392,We‚Äôre also GROSSLY underpaid.
15393,Working at the areas largest hospital you‚Äôd think you‚Äôd be able to support your family but sadly more and more employees are having to get second jobs just to pay their bills.
15394,Then having to deal with the general public‚Äôs berating and abuse because we‚Äôre expected to monitor every person walking through the door to not only make sure they‚Äôre wearing their masks but also turn people away because of visitor restrictions  instead of having a security guard who‚Äôs more equipped  do it.
15395,"We‚Äôre cussed out on a daily basis by family members over policies meant to protect people(we wish we could let you all in we really do) , yet we see no compensation for OUR extra efforts."
15396,Yet I bet Mr. Heywood sleeps just fine in his bed every night as I‚Äôm struggling to fall asleep anticipating another long day... maybe I‚Äôll actually get to sit down and enjoy my whole 30 min break throughout the course of the 12 hours I‚Äôm going to be working.
15397,"Lmao whatever you guys are on, I want some"
15398,"Yeah, seriously."
15399,I'd rather sleep alone in a tent in Canada this winter compared to being in the US.

15672,"Note, UK is now just under 20k cases per day, where as it was only doing 4k per day back during 1st lockdown where warehouses were being converted to hospitals."

15834,One thing you've failed to take into account is that we don't know the total number of people infected with the 1918 H1N1 virus that didn't end up dying or being hospitalized.
15835,We don't know.
15836,There was no way to test people for that back then and for decades after that.
15837,"What we do know is that in contemporary flu seasons, even bad ones like 2018, up to 60% of people are completely asymptomatic, and the vast majority of those who are, have mild illnesses."
15838,"Chances are, if you had the same ability to test for it back then, you'd be able to see that there were a lot more cases that were asymptomatic or mild enough to be confused for a cold or allergies, much like Covid is now."
15839,"However, since we don't have those numbers available from 1918, you're assuming that such cases didn't happen and hence covid is far more mild, as we do have those numbers and statistics available today that show mild and even asymptomatic infections."

15917,"It's a safe rule of thumb at this point that whatever death number you hear in the media, just increase that by 50% if you want to know how many have actually died."
15918,"So yes, we're at 340,000 deaths already."
15919,Personally I wish all those creating models would start from these far better estimates of actual deaths than the massive undercount of reported cases.
15920,"Most of the time when I see a media story on this or that model predicting X number of deaths by 1-2 months from now, I think how useless that is when that number was exceeded at least a month before."

15929,How did Cuomo do it?
15930,"Also, you should be averaging in hot spots, city centers where people are more closely packed."
15931,"If you average out the entire state and say they can handle it, well sure some hospitals will be able to while others can't depending on population density."
15932,"So unless you have an intuitive program in which a patient can be readily transported rapidly to another hospital that's unencumbered and has the appropriately trained staff as well as ventilators then you're also screwed, more people will pile up in the denser areas unable to get medical assistance."
15933,"At the moment, the entire state of Wisconsin as a state has 1395 hospital beds, and 1600 ventilators."
15934,That's not a whole lot.
15935,Most are already taken.
15936,Those are the numbers you should be looking at to see if they actually can handle it.
15937,"Czech Republic jist reported 12000 new cases and almost 100 deaths (translates to 370.000/2.977 in USA numbers)

Meanwhile they're saying that more than 10.000 cases is unsustainable here in Germany because the daily hospital work is disrupted as doctors and nurses need to take care of Covid19 cases."
15938,"Have fun sitting at home twiddling your thumbs for the next few years because the virus is not going to be completely eradicated, even with a vaccine, possibly not even within your lifetime."
15939,Once we get a vaccine 95%+ of people will be going back to a mostly normal routine.
15940,There is no other option.
15941,That's a really flawed study.
15942,"It's 1 hospital system, in a place that was overrun in March and now is not (New York), saying that the IFR is lower now that back when it was getting overrun."
15943,That's not good evidence at all.
15944,"In fact, it's evidence that the death rate is higher when medical capacity can't keep up."

15947,"&gt;At the start of this, we were thinking 3-6%."
15948,"That might have been what you thought, but epidemiologists have had it in the range of 0.5-2% since Wuhan."
15949,The comment was that numbers of deaths continue to stabilize or go down.
15950,Looking at the current month of data is pretty relevant to this trend topic.
15951,"Positivity rate, hospitalization rate, and all sorts of overlays would be relevant as well."
15952,"The initial comment was oversimplified analysis, so I opted to keep things simple."
15953,Can you cite any source to provide any evidence of your claim?
15954,Or do you 'believe' it because it fits the narrative you want to believe?

15974,"If coronavirus had a side effect of transporting people to places they need to go for a subsidised cost, I'd have to agree with you."
15975,"But here in reality, coronavirus exists to kill people, while buses exist to transport people to places they need to go for a subsidised cost."
15976,"A side effect of busses is that they will sometimes kill people, but at much lower rates than cars."
15977,Which is why cars have seatbelts and airbags and require a license to operate.
15978,"Nobody has had coronavirus transport them somewhere, subsidised by tax payers, except Donald Trump to Walter Reed."
15979,"To be fair, no one knows what Jan 2021 is going to look like, the winter might turn out OK, it might be a disaster, we are pretty sure that at least one vaccine would roll out by then but if it doesn't we don't really have a plan but to keep waiting."

15984,"Yeah, sure, but you didn't even come up with a percent of cases that go to ICU."
15985,All you said was that 38% of the people in ICU were under 50 (a demographic that represents like 80% of the population) and then you said that was somehow proof that this virus is as bad as the 1918 flu.
15986,&gt;Now I post a source showing you a stat that contradicts your argument and it's all the sudden irrelevant to this discussion??
15987,You didn't contradict my argument.
15988,You just said a number.
15989,That number doesn't mean anything because it does nothing to indicate the chances of an infected person being admitted to ICU.
15990,&gt;You said you sacrificed for the greater good by staying home for 5 months on unemployment.

15992,What government was recommending that?
15993,The government should have been recommending that.

15996,"That is an impossible position both for owners and for workers, a problem that can't be solved by individual choices."
15997,The government can spend money up front to reduce infection or it can spend money on the back end via Medicare &amp; Medicaid to treat infection.
15998,"We're going to pay either way, so we should pick the path that causes the least disruption &amp; suffering."

16077,"..hey, I have five dollars."
16078,Very true.

16082,Overrun?
16083,Really?
16084,Man who could‚Äôve thought that not treating this virus seriously would lead to it still killing people months later.
16085,  That's your only source for an r0 estimate and even they say it could be higher.
16086,"The rest are all rt, aka post interventions."
16087,Just take the L dude.
16088,Rational discussion and skepticism re: a disease that's killed a quarter million Americans != the minimizing trite y'all want it to be.
16089,"Sure this isn't the END Times, but it's certainly not a good time."
16090,I also notice that there are far more signs of brigadiers and turfing on the daily discussions than on most of the specialized discussions.
16091,"According to the CDC, only 2/3 of the total excess deaths can be attributed to COVID-19: https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/69/wr/mm6942e2.htm"
16092,There's reason to suspect that humid weather between 40-60 degrees is the sweet spot for this virus.
16093,Regions with that weather pattern in February-April had the most severe outbreaks.
16094,Airplane passengers exhale.
16095,Anyone who has flown a lot knows that getting sick from flying is commonplace.
16096,Sure
16097,Can we please just take a year off and teach everyone science and critical thinking starting back at the beginning?
16098,It‚Äôs like the whole country has taken stupid pills.
16099,"I get it, I really do, it‚Äôs a pretty personalized thing."
16100,I work hard to put on a lot of weight.
16101,A lot of others do the same.
16102,"I just think skinnier is not necessarily better, it just depends on the individual and their goals."
16103,That is why I made the remark about BMI being a bad metric.
16104,It‚Äôs simply too sweeping of a thing.
16105,This is why it is tough to extrapolate stats based on BMI and COVID.
16106,"I could be wrong, that‚Äôs just been a years long pet peeve... as someone who has worked really hard as an athlete to get a BMI over 30 and be ‚Äúobese.‚Äù It‚Äôs been kind of a joke."
16107,I wonder if America understands how the scoring works in this game.
16108,"Someone needs to tell them its like golf, you don't want a high score."
16109,Gotta speak a language they understand.
16110,IE: Slowly with lots of drawn out articulation.
16111,Hiiggghhh Scooorrreee Baaaadd America.

16113,"I dont speak Farsi, care to summarize?"
16114,You are.
16115,Bye.
16116,Another wave on top of a loooong wave that never fully receded.
16117,"Oh, look at this guy."
16118,Big man thinks he can look down on those of us that have to get by doing nothing and being depressed in a studio.
16119,You know what?
16120,Congrats.
16121,Don't let the pandemic stop you from making progress in life.
16122,"Safely, of course."
16123,Turd immunity is a good one.
16124,We suck.
16125,"If we had just locked down hard for one month, across all states, we could've contained it better and wouldn't have to shut down again."
16126,"But, no, people suck."

16201,I know multiple people that work in both federal and state government.
16202,The government has forgot this is even happening.
16203,The only time restrictions change is when the social media comments get too hot one way or the other.
16204,I work in psych unit and we can't do that with the patients either.
16205,We also have to put up with behaviors and physical restraints.
16206,Being a wage slave working for health insurance is a crappy existence.
16207,I wish I was voting Sanders/Yang this election.
16208,After Covid?
16209,"Covid is still here, it‚Äôs not gone"
16210,[removed]
16211,"Mine, too."
16212,It's fun hanging out at home and watching church online.
16213,There is no way we are going to risk anybody's health when modern technology lets us meet safely.
16214,Well dang.
16215,"Thing is, we could report number of PCR cycles to give a rough estimate of virus copies  detected."
16216,"That being said, not great correlation in the studies I‚Äôve seen to-date with contact tracing data on being able to ID a super-spreader."
16217,Source: scientist by training.
16218,"Very true, I actually wasn‚Äôt aware of it not being entirely effective, I guess what I‚Äôm trying to say is that once I get the guarantee that I won‚Äôt get covid I‚Äôm done with masks"
16219,243 orgy would be exhausting.
16220,Not necessarily.
16221,"If a treatment works faster than previous treatments a hospital stay might decrease from two weeks to one week, freeing up beds faster than before  and thus keeping the total number of occupied beds lower..."
16222,But we weren't talking about hospitalisations... we were talking about ICU admissions - which can drop significantly if treatments mean fewer people become sick enough to require intensive care - and deaths - which can drop if more people are saved by the treatment they receive.
16223,"But imagine if there is a virus that:

* Is as deadly as ebola
* Is airborne
* has asymptomatic carriers"
16224,If the mood of this sub hurts you...
16225,I'm not the one with their alarm clock set each day to talk about feelings on a science oriented sub.
16226,"So basically to find out how effective a vaccine is they have to give half the people The vaccine, and half the people a placebo and then send them out into the wild to live their lives."
16227,Then they track who gets the virus.
16228,What you‚Äôre hoping for is that there‚Äôs double or triple as many placebo positives as vaccine positives.
16229,"They would also be tracking how severe the infection is, but this will take longer to really measure."
16230,Also Sweden drastically adjusted their habits in a way that Americans weren‚Äôt going to without being explicitly told to.
16231,"‚ÄúI want to make it clear, no, we did not lock down like many other countries, but we definitely had a virtual lockdown,‚Äù Tegnell said."
16232,‚ÄúSwedes changed their behaviour enormously.
16233,We stopped travelling even more than our neighbouring countries.
16234,"The airports had no flights anywhere, the trains were running at a few per cent of normal service, so there were enormous changes in society.‚Äù

Do you believe that without lockdowns we would have seen empty US airports?"
16235,Trains running at a few percent of normal service?
16236,All these other changes the Swedish population made?
16237,We had idiots still wanting to party at spring break like nothing was happening.
16238,I would love it if Americans had taken this as seriously as Swedish citizens and changed their habits so drastically without strict government rules instructing such.
16239,Sadly a lot of Americans are a bunch of selfish science denying idiots who couldn‚Äôt care less about their fellow residents.
16240,They wouldn‚Äôt have stopped flying.
16241,They wouldn‚Äôt have stopped packing trains.
16242,They wouldn‚Äôt have stopped packing restaurants or theaters or concerts.

16244,Domestic cases must be 99+% of all cases in europe now.
16245,There is no significan‚Äôt increase in cases due to travel.
16246,"Right, so even with a vaccine, normality won't come back according to you?"
16247,"Btw, I understand wearing a mask isn't that hard but it's not really what life is about."
16248,I'm happy to wear a mask until there's a vaccine but why would I wear one after getting vaccinated?
16249,I don't wear a mask if I get the flu vaccine.
16250,Great question.
16251,Can someone provide some insight on placebo during trials?
16252,"I feel sorry for you guys, no one seems to care they just want to whine when they don‚Äôt get there way and then wonder why things close again"
16253,"Everywhere but the gym, tired of suffocating on my own sweat"
16254,Do you have the slightest grasp of the number of people that like in the United States or what?
16255,"Hey, I just wanted to reach out and say I‚Äôm sorry that this is so hard."
16256,My husband works in high ed (support staff) and he‚Äôs already had one mental health emergency with a student he mentored who also had mental health issues that were exacerbated by the pandemic.
16257,I have struggled with mental health on and off in my life and fortunately found a good counselor via telehealth in March.
16258,"It has been a life saver, and I can‚Äôt recommend it enough."
16259,Some places have sliding scales is money is an issue.
16260,It doesn‚Äôt have to be a local practice since it‚Äôs telehealth.
16261,I realize they teleheath may not be for everyone but it‚Äôs worth a try if you have access.
16262,I have a kinder and 2nd grader.
16263,Fully virtual and doing great.
16264,Our school has the buses run the weeks curriculum out and pick up the previous weeks work.
16265,They are on the zoom call about 4 hours a day with at least 90 min of that in various breaks.
16266,"Their PE, Music, and Art teachers all visit e as h class throughout the week on the zoom calls."
16267,"My kinder kid needed extra support at first, but after the second week she had the routine completely down."
16268,She just did the first quarter assessment and passed with flying colors.
16269,My second grader has already moved up to third grade math and we just finished the first quarter of school.
16270,His teacher messages me everyday after school to tell me what he may need help finishing from the day and if there were any behavioral problems.
16271,"My son sometimes does have problems locating things, but I can usually hear him ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt find it‚Äù so I go to grab it."
16272,"My kids are at a public school, but we are a incredibly small and rural district so the class sizes average 17 students per Teacher+Aid."
16273,"I understand this is not everyone situation, but my district could be used as an example of how to make it work."
16274,"We did have parents complaining about it, but they were putting all the blame on the schools and teachers and not taking any personal responsibility that they are THEIR children."
16275,It‚Äôs ironic that the ones the loudest about their rights to public socialized education are also the loudest about disagreeing with socialism....
16276,Never in my life have I ever seen something so informative.
16277,Jag h√•ller inte med.

16279,Men ja uppr√§tth√•lla sverigebilden √§r v√§l bra.
16280,Lite hoppl√∂st kanske...
16281,Im kinda scared they are doing human trials that early.
16282,"A lot lab mice died during development of of sars, some work weeks or month of delay.. and there are still no vaccine for it.."
16283,Because they don't always work.
16284,"But Jens, just like week you told us if we didn't follow the measures you might cancel Christmas... 

No presents for you"
16285,That where most of the healthcare workers has lost their home.
16286,"Those that were renting a house or living in an apt were evicted because they were working on the ""frontline""."
16287,"These ""respect to the healthworker"" is nothing but a farce."
16288,"There were a few articles out there where healthcare workers were evicted, especially the one that rented room, hotel, motel, and even rental apt/house were evicted over the fears of this."
16289,Eh.
16290,I think that is a crass way to look at it.
16291,I think most people who promote letting the virus run its course more or less accept that we cannot stop it and are more concerned about prolonging the pandemic and possibly giving the virus more time to mutate and get stronger/worse.
16292,"I am sure some people just don't care about ""others"" dieing, most are trying to find a balance that gets us through this as fast as possibly without drawing out the pain of lockdowns and reducing overall deaths...

Edit:  down vote me all you like, but there is now way we can make things better without trying to understand the other side."
16293,"We cannot fall into the ""separate teams trap"" and just assume everyone who disagrees with us is an evil uncaring devil."
16294,"If everyone is not on the same page or at least close this pandemic is just going to drag on and get worse, vaccine or not."
16295,I'm genuinely concerned about what we have in store for this autumn and fall.

16342,"The correct decision, won‚Äôt stop anyone from getting the virus anyway, but the negative impact for the kids and their parents could be big if schools are forced to close, such a mild virus for kids and they certainly are better at school."
16343,Amazingly it's hard to get millions of people to behave as a Borg-like hive-mind.
16344,All it takes is one.
16345,The really shocking thing to me is that people on this subreddit honestly seem surprised that we can't get 100% of the population to do anything.

16374,"Well that's why I personally use n95 masks or surgical masks, as can anyone else who wants to, as they are widely available here, as you very well know."
16375,So are we agreed that if everyone did that it would be effective?
16376,Because I'm pretty sure that's the whole point here.

16400,"A helpful reply I got from  [RufusSG](https://www.reddit.com/user/RufusSG) on this question:

Just so you know, the MRC model was updated a few days ago - [https://joshuablake.github.io/public-RTM-reports/iframe.html](https://joshuablake.github.io/public-RTM-reports/iframe.html)

They are now, rather usefully, giving two IFR estimates, ""early"" and ""late"": it's not entirely clear (and the cutoff between the two isn't explained) but I think ""early"" represents what the likely IFR would have been earlier in the pandemic, and ""late"" is closer to the current true value (with improvements in treatment, hospital care, etc.)."
16401,Unsurprisingly there has been a significant drop in the IFR for the oldest age groups: the younger ones have seen a *tiny* rise but it's almost certainly within the margin of error/more infections in the young providing a better estimate: it's certainly not an adjustment worth worrying about.
16402,"""Early"" IFRs:

* 0-4: 0.00042%
* 5-14: 0.0011%
* 15-24: 0.0038%
* 25-44: 0.025%
* 45-64: 0.39%
* 65-74: 2.5%
* 75+: 17%
* Overall: 0.91%

""Late"" IFRs:

* 0-4: 0.00051%
* 5-14: 0.0013%
* 15-24: 0.0046%
* 25-44: 0.031%

16508,"&gt;in some southern regions the capacity might be reached very very quickly

I was reading an article written by a top Italian southern doctor/healthcare administrator and he said exactly this during the first wave when a lot of people from the North started heading south."
16509,"He was practically begging people to stay away due to their not having sufficient ICU beds, supplies or even staff like anesthesiologists to cope."
16510,Seems like the situation is falling into line with what he was saying months ago: [https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/europe/italy-coronavirus-second-wave/2020/10/17/a1e143da-0f21-11eb-b404-8d1e675ec701\_story.html](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/europe/italy-coronavirus-second-wave/2020/10/17/a1e143da-0f21-11eb-b404-8d1e675ec701_story.html)

16513,"My personal guess is Vitamin D, [Vitamin C](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29099763/ ), and zinc."
16514,"In the case of vitamin C, there is some indication that the immune system can deplete supplies of C, so I'm going to take extra if the immune system fires off."

I haven't the foggiest idea why there isn't a general recommendation for the public to take a multivitamin daily, to cover the bases in the event the diet is lacking a bit."
16517,There is a distinction that is done in italy (i don't know about other countries) that makes it hard to know how many beds you have available: ICU and sub-ICU.
16518,Last time I checked the 12.5 were referred to proper ICU beds.

16520,Glad to hear it is somewhere for someone though
16521,Yes - because there was basically nothing happening here until 2 weeks ago.
16522,We were hovering around a few hundred cases forever in a country of 38 million people.

16537,D√ºsseldorf is 18 miles closer to London than Edinburgh is.
16538,"If D√ºsseldorf and Edinburgh have similar Covid rates (and you trust both sets of figures), why is it OK for someone to fly from Edinburgh to London, but not from D√ºsseldorf to London?"
16539,"Obviously if there is a huge discrepancy in infection rates, you're introducing risk - and if the very act of flying creates a hub for transmission, banning non-essential flights would make sense."
16540,"But I genuinely don't understand the argument that international travel is dangerous when domestic travel, over the same time and distance, is safe."

16558,This is a potential economic crisis in the making if we've got people in their 20's who are unable to work.
16559,Just because they are on disability doesn't mean they'll die young.
16560,That could be 50+ years of disability.

16564,"""aerosol/airborne"" is a [separate technical concept](https://thescrubnurse.com/airborne-vs-droplet-transmission-differences/) from ""droplet"" transmission, even though they both involve spreading through the air."
16565,The difference in effect is how far each method can spread through the air.
16566,Are you a resident of Moscow or St. Petersburg?
16567,I think they have a plan but they are not publicly saying that.
16568,The plan is a christmas lockdown.
16569,Schools are closed so no discussions from opposition or part of the government.
16570,A lot of people are not working so the lockdown won't affect that much.
16571,You can also force people to use their vacation days.
16572,People do travel but it's a short 2 weeks season so it is bearable... and anyhow who would come to italy for tourism during a pandemic?
16573,Also families stay together in that period.. a full lockdown might prevent that as it's impossible to fix it with suggestions or the rules we have now.
16574,So the christmas lockdown is the best lockdown you can have.
16575,The problem being if you lockdown now then it will be very hard to keep enforcing the lockdown after 2 months.
16576,I think they are slowly introducing new measures to delay the inevitable so that they can have severe restrictions when it's better.
16577,Which unfortunately is christmas.

16639,The 1918 flu was less infectious and lasted two full years.
16640,There were 1/8th as many people in this country then.
16641,There was wider adoption of masks and social distancing rules.
16642,"In fact, the average duration of the last three major flu pandemics in the US was about 1.6 years and those were all less infectious respiratory viruses."
16643,"We would need to be rid of this virus in Spring to be rid of it by next fall and given current infection rates, even a more-effective-than-expected vaccine and vaccine rollout is unlikely to get us there."
16644,We will probably be dealing with this virus into 2022.
16645,It would take a miracle to get us to a place where this isn‚Äôt a concern next fall.
16646,"In fact, there‚Äôs a good chance that even if the pandemic wanes, Covid will becomes endemic for the foreseeable future."
16647,Not saying we couldn‚Äôt get there but it would likely take 70%+ of the population getting regularly vaccinated which right now looks like it would take 2 shots once or twice a year.
16648,Unlikely but possible.

16664,There was a meta study posted on this sub that showed that schools opening didn't correlate with increased cases.
16665,I am not so sure I can trust that study because I would expect the large majority of pupils to be asymptomatic and therefore likely never tested.

16673,"Just because the article is stupid, doesn't mean it's not worth sharing."
16674,"BRASILIA (Reuters) - Brazil‚Äôs President Jair Bolsonaro and a high-ranking health official said on Wednesday the federal government will not buy a COVID-19 vaccine from China‚Äôs Sinovac, one day after the health minister said it would be included in the nation‚Äôs immunization program."
16675,"The apparent about-face, following anti-China social media commentary by some of Bolsonaro‚Äôs supporters, thrust into the open a simmering debate over vaccine policy between the president and key governors, who have been exploring alternatives to the AstraZeneca vaccine the federal government has prioritized."
16676,"On Tuesday, Health Minister Eduardo Pazuello said in a meeting with state governors that the ministry would buy the Sinovac vaccine to include in the immunization program, along with AstraZeneca‚Äôs vaccine developed with Oxford University."
16677,"That inclusion would be contingent on approval by drug regulator Anvisa, he said."
16678,"The Health Ministry on Wednesday announced that Pazuello has tested positive for the virus, making him the latest Brazilian official, including Bolsonaro, to do so."
16679,"Sao Paulo state biomedical research center, the Butantan Institute, is testing the Sinovac vaccine, and Governor Jo√£o Doria said he hopes to have regulatory approval by the end of the year to start vaccinating people in January."
16680,But Bolsonaro said on Wednesday Pazuello had been misinterpreted during the meeting with Brazil‚Äôs governors.
16681,"‚ÄúFor sure, we will not buy the Chinese vaccine,‚Äù Bolsonaro said on social media, responding to a supporter who urged him not to buy the vaccine."
16682,"Later in the morning, health ministry official Elcio Franco said all vaccines would be forced to go through federal health approval channels, but that the government had no interest in ‚ÄúChinese vaccines.‚Äù

Doria, who announced on Tuesday that the federal government had agreed to buy 46 million doses of the Sinovac vaccine, took exception to that stance on Wednesday."
16683,"‚ÄúThe vaccine is what is going to save us, save us all,‚Äù he told reporters."
16684,"‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not ideology, it‚Äôs not politics, it‚Äôs not an election that will save us."
16685,"It‚Äôs the vaccine,‚Äù added Doria, who is viewed as a potential opponent for Bolsonaro in 2022 presidential elections."
16686,"Brazil has been among the world‚Äôs hardest hit nations by the pandemic, with more than 5 million infections and nearly 155,000 COVID-19 deaths, according to a Reuters tally."
16687,"The inclusion of the vaccine, called CoronaVac, in the national vaccination program of a nation of 230 million people would be a major success for Sinovac in what could be one of the world‚Äôs first immunization efforts against the coronavirus."
16688,The Brazilian government already has plans to purchase the AstraZeneca vaccine and produce it at its biomedical research center FioCruz in Rio de Janeiro.
16689,"The Butantan Institute said on Monday that preliminary results from late-stage clinical trials of CoronaVac on 9,000 volunteers have proven that the two-dose Chinese vaccine is safe."
16690,Butantan director Dimas Covas said efficacy data will not be released until trials are completed.
16691,"Bolsonaro, a far-right leader who has drawn close to U.S. President Donald Trump, has made disparaging remarks about China in the past, even though it is Brazil‚Äôs largest trade partner."
16692,He has minimized the gravity of the virus and criticized lockdowns that governors such as Doria have enforced
16693,"You're getting downvoted for your comment, and while I don't agree that Italy went too hard initially it's certainly a point of view I have heard expressed here often."
16694,The major reluctance you are seeing right now is the fact that Italy's economy - already one of the most shaky in Europe and fundamentally tied to tourism - is in a very precarious position.
16695,"Additionally schools have been closed since March, making Italian students among those who have suffered most educationally worldwide (up to this point)."
16696,"Everyone who is listening to the science knows we need further restrictions, but nobody wants to get saddled with the ramifications that are almost certainly to come along with it."
16697,Additionally Italy has a small right-wing faction in government (national and regional) who are against nearly any form of additional lock-down and equate mask-wearing to the removal of freedom.
16698,Shutting borders is an effective policy - if you actually do not discriminate and do it coordinated.
16699,"That means a tight border for ALL outsiders and having the exact same procedures and rules for ALL outsiders, including your own citizens living abroad who want to come home."
16700,No exceptions.
16701,For anyone.
16702,Shutting down borders is basically the national equivalent of quarantine.
16703,"And just like 'small' quarantine needs to be tight to be effective, the national equivalent needs to be tight as well."
16704,"If you just shut the border for some groups but not others or have differeing rules, that means you'll get slips very often."
16705,"People dodging rules by rerouting from another country, your own overseas citizens bringing infections back etc, people not quarantining because they come from non-risk countries etc."
16706,"Some countries in Asia have basically cut off all outside connections and are doing fine

16782,"The mechanical nature of eating will possibly dislodge some virus particles and reduce detection, but I think the main reason is because the food particles will temporarily cover the virus so when they do a swab you're getting more food than virus, leading to a low sample count and a higher chance of testing negative."

Now that the cases are spread more or less evenly they are easier to treat because hospitals are not full everywhere, and also it's easier to track all contacts of positive people, and also, the highet number of tests prevents a lot the uncontrolled spread of the virus

But again, it's not good, the situation is starting to slip out of control, and we all know here that when it's out of control the growth is exponential

My whole point was just that yes, these numbers are the highest peaks since the start of the pandemic, but in my opinion we are, or at least we should, be able to contain it, the government is not doing a bad job, and people are overall good with precautions at this point

16936,Hardly counts as a true source.
16937,Nope scientists are saying we need to social distance and mask for an indeterminate time even after a vaccine has been deployed.
16938,"This is what the editorial board of *Nature*, one of the most prestigious scientific journals in the world, said:

&gt;a safe and effective vaccine represents the most powerful weapon against the virus, at both the individual and the population level ‚Äî **but it will not be the only one**."
16939,"**Mask-wearing, hand-washing and social distancing will need to continue for some time."
16940,"**

*The Lancet*, another scientific journal, published [this](https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanmic/article/PIIS2666-5247(20\)30151-8/fulltext):

&gt;Often it is difficult to offer solutions, but it is straightforward in this case: interventions that have been in use since early in the pandemic, most crucially physical distancing and hand hygiene, **must continue indefinitely."
16941,"**

EDIT: I‚Äôm literally just relaying what the scientists are saying folks."
16942,Downvoting the messenger doesn‚Äôt make the reality go away.
16943,"Sounds like he got it at church, based on his office‚Äôs statement."
16944,"He says he doesn‚Äôt have symptoms yet, FWIW"
16945,Yeah good points.
16946,Sounds to me like when the vaccine comes out every headline should be ‚ÄúVaccine efficacy is based on how we were three months ago.
16947,If we stop social distancing and wearing masks this vaccine will very likely be less effective than we expect‚Äù
16948,I will never get over that they made a pathogen political
16949,It only makes him look worse to smart people.
16950,He will be just fine with Florida voters
16951,You‚Äôve done nothing but repeat the same sentence again and again... expecting all businesses to have an extra 6months operating capital is downright retarded.
16952,Even the largest monopolies received cash injections - some exceeding billions.
16953,"You clearly lack even the most rudimentary of business knowledge, your improper use of terminology alone gives that away."
16954,&gt; Most people do not joyously flaunt their ignorance.
16955,Why do you choose to do so?
16956,Why are you not ashamed of ignorance?
16957,"üòÜ I would ask the same of you, but you debate like a 9 year old."
16958,"I‚Äôve explained my position, you can‚Äôt seem to return the same with any civility."
16959,Your failure to elaborate and resorting to ad hominem makes you look very feeble.
16960,&gt; why are you so obsessed with the world knowing how little you understand?
16961,The world?
16962,"We‚Äôre on Reddit and the only people seeing this conversation are you and I, pleb."
16963,"The limited depth of your remarks would indicated that you‚Äôd like to avoid this conversation though, and I can‚Äôt blame you."
16964,Your pride only makes you weak.
16965,No.
16966,Italian and French lockdowns were deeper and lasted longer.
16967,"Both needed to close non-essential non-retail, which never happened in GER."
16968,No lockdown is perfect as there are always people that need to work.
16969,Hence caseload matters.
16970,Reason why we got away better than F or ITA is not because we acted better.
16971,We acted earlier (relative to caseload).
16972,I do not think we can or should wait until christmas.
16973,"Thanks, JarJar!"
16974,I was diagnosed at 19 but could get * no* real help until 23 because the first three neurologists I had simply weren't familiar with modern treatments and I lost health insurance (USA) at one point and couldn't afford the basic meds for 2 years.
16975,"So wildly similar, 8 years miserable and just got worse every year!"
16976,When my new insurance kicked in and had to go to a new neurologist 'in network' turns out he was pretty passionate about Narcolepsy and had me start Xyrem (which took 1 year for insurance to agree to cover because it's like 6k a month lol) and my life is so much better now!
16977,Wouldn't wish the Hell on anyone and also hope the likely inevitable new sufferers can have access to help they're gonna desperately need.
16978,Greeter is right inside the door but yeah.
16979,Not sure why we don't have drive through here.
16980,They prob do in Sydney
16981,Your desire to be right and ‚Äúwin‚Äù this conversation is powerful I see.
16982,Your lack of actual concern is also troubling.
16983,"Yes, statistically it doesn‚Äôt impact people in their 30s with deaths but those age groups and especially college age students are identified asymptomatic carriers infecting their families and killing the ones with increased risk."
16984,Like Sargent Shultz......I know nothing !
16985,"I don't think US can lockdown now and recover, that ship has long sailed."
16986,"The cases are too high, too thoroughly spread throughout the country."
16987,Back in March they were more isolated (NY/NJ etc.
16988,"), and had they shut down some states, closed some borders (apparently they can't do this?)"
16989,then they could have kept many states covid-free for months and months.
16990,US's failure is not just on the people but on the overall strategy from a federal and state level.
16991,And there is definitely not enough economic support to the people to take a harsh approach that some other countries took.
16992,That's very disturbing to hear.
16993,AZ had 1040 new cases yesterday.
16994,3.2% of the population have it.
16995,That's 1 in 30 people.
16996,"How you can feel safe interacting with people, knowing that 1 in 30 of them is potentially contagious?"
16997,"It may seem ""back to normal"" to those living it, but it's like a twilight zone to those of us watching from overseas."
16998,"1000+ cases a day is ""normal"" ?"
16999,?
17000,A source says he received the placebo.
17001,[https://valor.globo.com/empresas/noticia/2020/10/21/voluntario-brasileiro-que-morreu-em-ensaio-de-nao-recebeu-imunizacao-diz-fonte.ghtml](https://valor.globo.com/empresas/noticia/2020/10/21/voluntario-brasileiro-que-morreu-em-ensaio-de-nao-recebeu-imunizacao-diz-fonte.ghtml)
17002,"Probably a dumb question, but why do you need to test for placebo in life or death situations like these?"
17003,I can understand for testing effectiveness of painkillers or something but how would knowing what you have help you recover from something like this?
17004,?
17005,I agree 100%.
17006,"I think the issue here is proximity, its an interesting insight into human psychology."
17007,"Australia is in close proximity to New Zealand, and this made them realize how bad things were back in August."
17008,Comparing themselves to New Zealand they decided to eliminate the virus as well.
17009,"With 700 cases per day growing exponentially they declared a state of disaster and locked down hard, to essentially eliminate the virus by mid October."
17010,Canada on the other hand is in close proximity to the USA.
17011,"People love to compare and feel good about ""how much better than the USA"" we are doing."
17012,"However on a world scale, Canada is a disaster with 2500 new cases a day and 20 deaths per day."
17013,Our cases and deaths will grow exponentially if we relax restrictions now.
17014,"Even if it wasn't placebo, one death wouldn't mean much."
17015,No vaccine is going to be 100% effective.
17016,The first vaccine is a month or so away from an EUA with more in the pipeline right behind it
17017,"Don't, they have a hell of a ride on the way down and don't have to deal with Nov 3"
17018,What data are you looking at?
17019,"Afaik, it's because news companies use different definitions for ready,

Personally Ready means that it is licensed to be taken in the US, doesnt matter if it is available to everyone in the US, which wont happen for months after."
17020,"The Vaccine should be accepted in November or very early December, but then the vaccine wont be widely available until April(what fauci said) in the US."
17021,"They need to bring them in for two days so it could spread /s

Just keep them closed."
17022,Can‚Äôt make a declarative statement off one case but I see where you‚Äôre coming from
17023,My state is just now reporting deaths as far back as April....
17024,"Huh, the breaking news is that people die every night?"
17025,Wow!
17026,Changed my life!
17027,Who woulda known
17028,You're pulling all of this straight out of your arse.
17029,That's the issue.
17030,"Maybe the risk is the same, maybe it's an order of magnitude less."
17031,You don't know.
17032,You're just guessing.
17033,I‚Äôm for wiping Pitt off the map.
17034,I‚Äôm also from Cleveland.
17035,People like you are why we can‚Äôt get this under control
17036,But it wouldn‚Äôt have been counted as a COVID case without a positive PCR test.
17037,"COVID precautions are taken to limit spread just in case it was and it may well have been, but if untested it would‚Äôve have contributed to COVID case numbers."
17038,Transmission of any viral URI would go down if people with upper respiratory symptoms isolated themselves/ wore masks.
17039,"I think it would be more useful to compare to the number of people who died, not the total population of America."
17040,"2,500,000 years of life lost divided by 220,000 people who died = 11 years of life expectancy lost per person who died"
17041,They would have been 100% better off with the meth head.
17042,"He actually seems like a good guy, and there's no fucking way he's a worse person than DeSantis"
17043,"If I remember correctly from an article I read, it was deadly at first and then became the common cold."
17044,People like you are why we can‚Äôt get this under control
17045,Estimates for the 1918 flu are 4 to 6 times less deaths if it happened now due to the advances in medical technologies.
17046,Based on comparing the death rates of other respiratory diseases now and then.
17047,Smoking doesn‚Äôt put others at risk genius.
17048,It‚Äôs a personal choice.
17049,Getting people sick isn‚Äôt.
17050,"Everyone should take extra precautions, otherwise your arguement is essentially ""fuck you, stay inside if you're over 60 or have pre-existing conditions""."
17051,"Walking around without a mask on can still infect someone at risk who is wearing one, and asymptomatic cases are common."
17052,I don‚Äôt care what Canada has.
17053,"It‚Äôs not remotely
Comparable to the United States."
17054,He is.
17055,"Like, he's now basing reopening status on the number of *trees* in a county!"
17056,"Seriously, what does any of that have to do with the virus?"
17057,"‚ÄúAntivirals?‚Äù

I‚Äôm getting so tired of people claiming we have ‚Äúantivirals‚Äù for respiratory disease."
17058,"Sure they exists, but they‚Äôre largely thought to be useless."
17059,"The three FDA-approved neuraminidase antiviral flu drugs available in the United States, recommended by the CDC, include: oseltamivir (Tamiflu), zanamivir (Relenza), and peramivir (Rapivab)."
17060,Spend a little time reading about these drugs.
17061,"They provide very little benefit, and usually must be administered within 24-48 hours of symptom onset to have any effect."
17062,"Additionally, antivirals are prolifically susceptible to resistance mutation."
17063,Doom and gloom?
17064,Maybe.
17065,But antivirals for respiratory disease are essentially snake oil at this point.
17066,We haven‚Äôt cracked this code yet.
17067,It's called discipline.
17068,"People lack it and instead of holding themselves accountable, they would rather make it about 'freedom'."
17069,"This is all a gigantic, collective cognitive dissonance."
17070,Make Americans Ghoulish Again hats.
17071,Then don‚Äôt post about not being able to see your mother.
17072,"You can, you just choose not to"
17073,I have profound mental health issues.
17074,Childhood refractory clinical depression.
17075,"Still though, the lives of my parents are more important than my feelings."
17076,You can still see your family.
17077,"Practice safety guidelines, wear a mask and keep your distance and ideally do it outdoors with a good air flow."
17078,"These studies show that another denialist talking point, which you still see on these threads, ""We just don't want to overrun the hospitals; that's all we can do,"" was dangerous and stupid."
17079,"It's been clear since the beginning that the longer people stayed virus free, the better chance they would have to survive."
17080,Not maxing out the healthcare system was only one part of it.
17081,"And naturally the more people still alive when a vaccine finally arrives, the less people who will die overall."
17082,People like you are why we cant get this under control.
17083,Is this also counting everyone else who had to put their plans on hold?
17084,That is indeed a very fun fact.
17085,Ok buddy üëåüèº
17086,Genuine question.
17087,Do a lot of people just not understand how pathogens spread or how respiration works?
17088,I have friends who won‚Äôt use a public restroom (pre-pandemic) due to the germs yet they‚Äôre fighting wearing a mask and want to go out and about like all is normal.
17089,I have coworkers who are taking the virus seriously yet they think just wearing a face shield without a mouth/nose covering is just dandy.
17090,I don‚Äôt get it.
17091,Do we need PSAs blasting that show 3D versions of how germs spread via coughing/sneezing?
17092,We have a real empathy problem in the US.
17093,"No one cares about anyone but themselves, it seems."
17094,"I would think Halloween, of all holidays, would be fairly safe as long as you didn't go to any parties."
17095,"Yes, I wonder what the point of their highlighting this uninteresting statistic is."
17096,There's no need for your childish insults.
17097,Let's at least try to act like mature adults.
17098,"I said it right from the start, I'm a pro-masker and wear surgical masks everywhere I go, so your insults are ironically ignorant."
17099,"Let me state one more time for the record, I am a pro-masker who understands the importance of wearing masks."
17100,Fabric face coverings are not masks.
17101,"Sorry if that hurts your feelings, but it's a literal fact."
17102,"Regarding that clinical trial:

1."
17103,"Cloth masks had a significantly higher infection risk than the control, which was status quo for hospitals in Hanoi - no masks, sometimes mask, etc."
17104,2.
17105,"Penetration of cloth masks by particles was almost 97% and medical masks 44%
3."
17106,You're wrong about the pathogens being smaller than COVID.
17107,They tested for 17 different respiratory illnesses INCLUDING SARS.
17108,4.
17109,You're completely ignoring the direct contact infection vector and COVID can live on surfaces for up to 28 days in ideal conditions.
17110,Cloth-maskers are frequently touching their mask and depositing the virus on to the surfaces they touch.
17111,5.
17112,The six-foot social distancing recommendation is based on everyone wearing medical masks not cloth.
17113,6.
17114,"Contrary, [this](https://advances.sciencemag.org/content/6/36/eabd3083) study shows that neck gaiters actually increase the droplet counts."
17115,Can you provide a single peer reviewed study that provides evidence to back up the claim that cloth masks work?
17116,There are no more shortages of surgical masks and the only excuse to not use them is you simply cannot afford them.
17117,"If you choose to remain ignorant of cloth masks then that's your prerogative, but that would mean you're a virtue signaling cloth-masker who only cares about going through the motions and doesn't give a shit about everyone else's health."
17118,"Sure, previous media fearmongering was like a crack in the wall while trump is a sledgehammer on it."
17119,Facts üíØ
17120,I can take the virus seriously without being locked down.
17121,I think we may be unable to use the word P o l it ic s here.
17122,"I can see the comments in your profile, and I agree with your sentiment."
17123,"I too prefer the mankind/humanity interpretation, I just thought it worth mentioning that whatever their ideals and intent, the system they implemented unfortunately did not come close to their elegant prose."
17124,Oh geez.
17125,That sounds like a winner!
17126,I feel like we're about to crash.
17127,Totally.
17128,Not everyone has to choice to stay away however.
17129,But yes stay away as much as possible.
17130,"It's been shown that both android and apple phones still track and keep a log of where it's been, even if it was switched to airplane mode AND THEN TURNED OFF."
17131,Why would sitting close to an infected person on a plane be much different than it would be anywhere else?
17132,Droplets and aerosol are droplets and aerosol.
17133,"The plane likely has less airborne risk, but that won't help you if the passenger next to you is infected."
17134,A+
17135,"anecdotes are fun, aren't they?"
17136,Texas is one of the worst states in the country when it comes to healthcare coverage.
17137,"&gt;Elledge calculated life expectancy for more than 200,000 Americans who have died of COVID-19 and made two surprising findings: COVID-19 has cost Americans 2.5 million years of life ‚Äì about as much as from six months of cancer deaths."
17138,"**And roughly half that loss has come from people who died in middle age, not their waning years."
17139,"**

17184,My parents allowed them to aswell because iTs mY bIrThDaY.
17185,That is no reason for them to visit in a pandemic?!
17186,Atleast my grandma doesn't have a fever anymore and my grandpa's fever isn't bad either.
17187,Offhand 100 seems like a big number.
17188,Is this a sane one?
17189,Is it good or bad?
17190,Washington has had 2267 tested deaths.
17191,Assuming 0.5% IFR gives 450k infections.
17192,100k cases implies they've tested 1/4.5 of infections.
17193,"A reinfection would only be found if it was tested both times,  so you'd expect 4.5^2 =20 times more actual reinfections."
17194,"This would put that number at 2,000, or 0.5% of total infections."
17195,"The population of Washington is 7.6 million,  implying about 6% of the population has been exposed."
17196,Following this naive math indicates that about 1/12 of people may be vulnerable to reinfection.
17197,"Which is by far the highest portion I've seen in any similar chain of logic,  so I'm not sure it's sane,  but it's definitely bad."
17198,One flaw in the logic is in the 6%: being exposed the first time probably indicates you're more likely to be exposed again.
17199,We also have about 5 billion more people on earth though.
17200,So of course the number is gunna be higher.
17201,Not to say I‚Äôm weird Covid denier.
17202,I‚Äôm just saying to put the anxiety riddled readers of reddit at ease the numbers will be inflated because the population is inflated and Covid is no we‚Äôre near as deadly as say smallpox or the plague.

17227,"But your claim that air travel is ""about as risky as any other extended gathering [...]"" is totally made up."
17228,They are improving their ability to treat it as they learn more about it.

17249,"üíØ 

NY is at 33,000 FL is 16,000."
17250,I'm feeling quite confident.
17251,I'll bet you if you want.
17252,I'm.in Winnipeg at we us ND numbers to compare.
17253,We hit 178 last week for one day be cases.
17254,We were down to 100 today and 80 yesterday (for the whole province)  and more restrictions were put in place.
17255,The us border will not be open until he new year at this rate.
17256,"24 days, +2000 deaths, and cases are on the rise."
17257,Still a long way to go compared to NY.
17258,There have been hundreds of research papers written on the subject of the Spanish Flu.
17259,"One of the more cited examples of such was written in [2009 by Jeff Taubenberger, David Morens, and Anthony Fauci."
17260,"](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2599911/#__ffn_sectitle)

In their research they looked into hundreds of autopsy reports from victims of that pandemic and found that in 85-90% of victims, the deaths were caused by an acute viral infection causing severe damage to the lungs of the victims that were then infected with secondary bacterial infections largely by Streptococcus, or pneumococcus bacteria."
17261,"That wouldn't happen today and the risk of that happening today is minimized in all but the elderly and the immunocompromised, by the availability of antibiotics."
17262,"The remaining 10-15% died from ARDS, when people died from lungs filling up with fluid and causing them to drown in their own fluids."
17263,Ventilators and other medical technology exists to alleviate that threat today.
17264,"Covid is also an acute viral infection that targets the lungs, if it were brought back to that era that didn't have antibiotics, Ventilators, or any modern medicine that would prevent and treat severe infections, the fatality rate would be much higher than it is today."
17265,"You are also comparing a disease that spanned a several years and ended over a hundred years ago in an era without the benefits we have today, to a pandemic that hasn't even peaked yet and is still killing several thousand people a day around the world, and has already killed 1/3rd the number of Americans killed by Spanish Flu in the 8 months since the first Covid death in the US."
17266,Will it kill the same proportion of Americans as 1918 H1N1?
17267,"Probably not, since we do now have antibiotics, antivirals, ventilators and all the other advantages we have today to fight severe viral infections and prevent/ treat secondary bacterial infections."
17268,"However, its not hard to conclude that if this current virus was brought back to 1918, it would likely have far worse outcomes for all age groups than it does today."
17269,Don‚Äôt forget it‚Äôs also able to spread before it causes symptoms.
17270,As long pre symptomatic spread exists there is no evolutionary pressure on the virus to become milder.
17271,[removed]
17272,"Which falls back to very simple logic:

If you're at higher risk, take greater precautions."
17273,You or people you come into contact with is everyone's individual responsibility.
17274,That's why a one size fits all approach doesn't work.

17316,That is changing quickly.
17317,I‚Äôve been flying at least once a month since February and airports are starting to pickup again.
17318,I was reading traffic was only down 60% in some areas now VS 90% in May.
17319,"But it says could, not would."
17320,"The ""lock down just the elderly"" shtick of skeptics is stupid for precisely this reason, among others."
17321,"Well, do you have the results of the trials on those vaccines?"
17322,My family lives in the Anchorage area.
17323,One of them works for the Native healthcare system as well.
17324,"From my understanding, the Native villages are where it is really bad as they cannot get the necessary supplies like hand sanitizer and masks."
17325,"A lot of those villages lack modern conveniences like running water, electric and phone service."
17326,"Everything has to be flown in, which in turn jacks up the price even more than places like Anchorage or Fairbanks."
17327,"Add in limited hospitals with ICU capabilities in Alaska, limited health care resources in general and you have a recipe for disaster."
17328,"Response time in an emergency situation in some of the remote villages can be 8-12 hours or even days, depending on weather conditions, availability of a helicopter and landing conditions."
17329,The average Alaska State Trooper ratio is 1 to 250 citizens and their range of response in several thousand square miles.
17330,Troopers based out of Fairbanks tend to work from Fairbanks area all the way up to the North Slope/ ANWAR and over toward Bethel.
17331,"Most of the villages there cannot be accessed by land, if you get lucky in the winter you can access by ice road but that‚Äôs super dangerous."
17332,So if you live in these areas and need help you‚Äôre stuck waiting for days in a lot of cases
17333,"1918 flu, I believe."
17334,"That is a different virus and the world was far different a century ago, though."
17335,You would hold someone accountable for some random shit they did in kindergarten?
17336,Ffs man.
17337,Third surge of the first wave.
17338,The recent case exported from mainland China to  Taiwan is a false positive.
17339,"[health.udn.com/health/story/120950/4937607](http://health.udn.com/health/story/120950/4937607)

Meanwhile, there were several exported cases from Taiwan, but local contacts in Taiwan were also tested and found negative."
17340,Thus it is likely that these cases were also false positive cases.
17341,"[health.udn.com/health/story/120950/4937619](http://health.udn.com/health/story/120950/4937619)

Declaring a positive case after the first test before re-testing is much faster and safer, but it may lead to false positives that needs further clarification."
17342,"Unfortunately, most health authorities don't bother to   make such clarifications."
17343,Third surge of the first wave.
17344,"I was comparing the effectiveness of vaccines, not the viruses."
17345,On that basis of criticism I was saying Covid was Malaria too.
17346,Don't strawman.
17347,"I claim zero knowledge of the phase three results, and, as you've pointed out, 50% effectiveness is a minimum standard."
17348,I am of absolutely no doubt that some candidates will significantly exceed that straight out the traps.
17349,But not all.
17350,What is of legitimate concern is the misconception in society that a vaccine is a wonder drug which will cure all ills immediately.
17351,In the rarefied world we live in its not difficult to see a good deal of dissatisfaction within portions of the population when a long promised 'cure' (and I'm quite aware that that's not what a vaccine is) still allows for (limited) chains of transmission.
17352,No one here has covid either
17353,Yes.
17354,There has been a complete lack of public education on how COCID works.
17355,Mostly because the White House has handicapped the CDC
17356,"Are you one of our noble freedom fighters who is to scared to wear a mask, I salute you for making our lock down more miserable and longer than it needed be."
17357,Hopefully it can result in something like Israel did
17358,I didn't?
17359,I just said covid is 13th deadliest for white people.
17360,"I am not blaming the west, the article."
17361,"Yeah who gives a shit about 9/11, only 3000 people died, humans don't live forever and violence has always been one of the causes."
17362,If the purpose of writing something is to tell information then jusy say the number.
17363,What was in august and what is it now?
17364,Hate these garbage title/post.
17365,I guess that is BNO news.
17366,I‚Äôll definitely be dead.

17368,You implied we only care about pandemics that effect white people when it more about the fact we still have records from ancient and medieval Europe.
17369,Not everything is about race.
17370,"That literally happens all the time, hospitals go on diversion all the time"
17371,"People losing earning power and being priced out of proper healthcare, housing, food, education for decades: I'm okay with this."
17372,People being asked to wear a mask in public for months: Absolutely outrageous!
17373,Yes I believe that is his point
17374,"People have stopped the social distancing part entirely because they got the stupid idea, probably from the media, that masks are 100% effective."
17375,I'm DONE with this crap.
17376,"STAYING AWAY FROM PEOPLE IS PRIORITY NUMBER ONE, THEN MASKS AND WASHING HANDS FREQUENTLY ARE NUMBER TWO."
17377,MASKS DO NOT WORK 100% YOU DO NOT NEED TO BE STANDING ON MY ASS IN LINE AND YOU DO NOT NEED TO SIT ELBOW-TO-ELBOW WITH ME ANYWHERE.
17378,NO REASON.
17379,I'M NOT ON A PLANE OR PUBLIC TRANSIT.
17380,"That depends, maybe this is what they mean end of first phase."
17381,We know the world is not prepared for second wave so I am ambivalent about these news.
17382,Maybe someone needs to share this with trump.
17383,&gt;You got your hopes up?
17384,Based on what exactly?
17385,"Some people thought (and still do) think it will go away by itself

Not sure where they'd get an idea like that"
17386,How would you know?
17387,We didn't even try man.
17388,"Even back in March and April, every goddamn business in the nation declared itself ""essential""."
17389,"When people talk about the US lockdown, like, what US lockdown?"
17390,Shit didn't happen.
17391,What I'd really like to see is a comparison between surgical masks and these fashion masks that everyone is wearing now.
17392,For example I bought some that are basically impenetrable unless you're breathing in and sucking it against your mouth.
17393,Breathe out and it just fogs up your glasses.
17394,"All the public health recommendations say wear thick cloth, blah blah blah."
17395,Is a deflector shield a good thing?
17396,Shouldn't it allow some air through?
17397,"Similar things being reported in brazil and mexico, knowing that only few of those cases will be sequenced im wondering if and how many of those cases are just reactivation of initial an infection."
17398,People act like this is just a bad flu still when in reality its still not confirmed that this shit infects you for the rest of your life.
17399,I am not blaming the west?
17400,Cases per capita in The Eu average is about 150% higher.
17401,So compared to th rest of Eu its doing fairly well.
17402,"As a side note, heard immunity was never the Swedish strategy."
17403,"They basically did the same as the rest of Europe, just volontarely."
17404,"I mean, you guys all sit at home and keep ordering stuff through a company that blatantly violated social distancing yesterday in their orientation and then all they had to say to me when I complained after leaving was, ""It was a mistake."""
17405,"Not following state mandates that have been in place since March in a way that was totally unnecessary and can lead to people dying is not a ""mistake."""
17406,And they stay in business and run around the clock because people think they are doing something GOOD by ordering loads of stuff.
17407,Blaming the west for keeping good records.
17408,How are we supposed to know about other pandemics if they didn't record it.
17409,Me from Vietnam: Covid still a thing?
17410,Do you want to know something really terrifying?
17411,"If Trump loses on Nov 3, the entire winter is him as lame duck with all the motivation he needs to really wreck the place before Biden is sworn in."
17412,Shocked they actually closed.
17413,Good job Texas!

17604,"In my state, we've started relaxing lockdown policies based on hospitalizations, which I think is a good compromise and way forward."
17605,I just don't see people going back into lockdown.
17606,"Someone asked me the other day ""Why are schools talking about returning to virtual but bars are just now allowed to reopen?""."
17607,"Well, because the businesses of the bars will go bankrupt (if they haven't already) and schools simply won't based on the way the government allocates money."
17608,"Wasn't really short, and I semi-addressed your points, but it was more of a stream of consciousness thing."

17617,"It's the ""it looks very much like it in every other way but tested negative so we can't prove it"" scenario."
17618,But then there are other types viral pneumonia that could look very similar on imaging.
17619,Suspecting it to be COVID when tested negative to everything is down to epidemiology.
17620,If most people passing from COVID have pre existing conditions is it safe to assume they would make it to 80?

Do you seriously think all those are covid deaths?"
17770,"Is that the only thing you can conceive of now, death by covid?"
17771,"A huge chunk of those additional deaths are ""collateral casualties"" due not to covid, but to the disastrous human response to it, to name just a few:

* People dying of unrelated diseases because the hospitals are closed during lockdown except to covid patients."
17772,"Remember all those ""elective and nonessentials"" that are/were suspended?"
17773,"Well, those include everything from cancer screenings to apendectomies."
17774,"Surprise

* Continuing the above, a tsunami of preventable deaths is expected as early as next year due to treatable diseases being left unchecked/undetected and hospital backlog making treatment impossible

* ""Deaths of despair"" because 1 in 5 small businesses has been permanently lost (and increasing), hunger, destitution, etc

* Deaths by overdose and substance abuse due to lockdown-induced depression and mental illness

* Deaths by domestic abuse more than doubled

* And far more, which you'll never bother to learn about

And before you say it, no, lockdowns were not a must, Sweden never did any (and not even social distancing or masks) and they are not only out of the woods, they are growing now and have a bright future ahead."

17783,"Only the sickest people got tested, and a large portion of them needed ICU and/or died."
17784,Now we have greatly expanded testing capacity so we are now capturing the mild cases.

17786,"A much smaller number need ICU, and the system is not overwhelmed yet."
17787,"In reality, fewer number of people are getting infected than in April, it's just that we are able to see them better."

Nothing about becoming a silent killer, only supposition, that maybe it mutated to spread more easily (which is the point of evolutionary changes, spread and multiply as widely as possible in present conditions.)"
17828,Exactly my question.
17829,What was the name of it?
17830,Sputnik-V?
17831,Are there distribution issues?
17832,Is there issues of it even being effective?
17833,There were MANY articles puffing it up on this very subreddit.
17834,And now the country of its origin is still being punched around.
17835,What is happening?
17836,according to some studies in the UK one in 45 people have symptoms continuing for months
17837,"Worth keeping in mind also that for the 220000+ deaths, among the 8 million cases that don't end in death, an immense number have had their health maimed possibly for years if not permanently."
17838,So we wind up with these walking wounded who then live reduced lives from here on out.

Wow, such a lockdown ... is totally hindering people to take the train to Stockholm or other regions"
17850,Maybe not.
17851,"There was this one pandemic that was around world war 2, I forgot which one, and they had lots of chaos and amid the world war 2 the virus mutated and became more severe."
17852,"Yes, that's right."
17853,You judge a state by it's metrics compared to other states.
17854,"Texas is the worst state for healthcare coverage and like you said, has lots of lower socioeconomic areas..."
17855,"It's also near the bottom of almost every single measure - education, hs grad rate, college grad rate, post college grad rate, income, abortion rate, abortion access, healthcare access, prisons, private prisons, prisoners, etc."

17857,Shithole state.
17858,So much for *united * states.
17859,Each state is in an everybody solo mode.
17860,We are never going to get out of this pandemic.

17880,They can't being doing things that much different halfway across the country.
17881,It's not because people are reporting wearing masks that they are not actually careless though.

17883,"You have people wearing the masks wrong, people continuously touching their masks, you have lots of people with covid symptoms actually going to work (even doctors!"

17886,God bless the hospital workers right now.
17887,"Yeah but the main message of his study is  that over half of those years of life expectancy lost comes from people who were middle aged or younger, even though they account for a much smaller portion of deaths."
17888,"Because for example when someone who is 50 years old dies, they lose 30 years of life expectancy."
17889,"It can easily be made with gene synthesis without much knowledge at a cost around $100,000 usd."

South Korea took the pandemic seriously, with masks, social distancing, contact tracing and quarantine for people exposed."
17897,"They have a covid death rate less than ten percent of ours, closer to one percent of ours."

17901,Let's try again.
17902,"Your issue is with how HIV/covid deaths are counted, I don't have any control of either."
17903,My question was how do you account for all of the excess cardiac/ respiratory/ CVA deaths we've had this year.
17904,Nythro?
17905,You get used to them.
17906,I even agreed with them once on something
17907,I mean second hand smoke definitely does put others at risk.
17908,That's why you can't smoke inside most places anymore.
17909,"Isn't this the one that has to be grown in a chicken egg, though?"
17910,So the time for mass production is a lot longer.

17912,YES.
17913,"I‚Äôve said that if you‚Äôre not gonna wear a mask or protect others, just slap me and every other medical professional in the face."

17916,Not being erradicated doesn't mean that it will always be the same threat as it now.
17917,"After a vaccine is released, and more and more of the population becomes infected (especially those who won't take the vaccine) the transmission rate should continue to decline over time."
17918,"Hopefully, it gets really low."
17919,I hope so on so many levels.
17920,For those who are truly scared and this has taken a toll on their mental health.
17921,For those who have lost people to whatever during this time.
17922,Those who are getting cabin fever wanting to get out of the protection of their 4 walls.
17923,I can keep going.
17924,I just want to see people happy again.
17925,Looks like it‚Äôs based on total fatalities not percent of population.
17926,It I‚Äôm mistaken someone please correct me.
17927,Talking to anyone anymore about this virus is like talking to a snowman..

17952,It will almost definitely mutate to be less deadly and arguably already is.
17953,Viruses evolve to be less deadly because the longer the host is alive the longer the virus has to spread.
17954,You won't.
17955,There may be an annual or semi-annual vaccine.

18118,10 Flight Attendants died in the pre-mask days of covid where I work.

18120,Masks work.

18123,"Well, and I'd add that since you need 2 infections sequenced, it's only 75.5k possible patients checked for reinfection."
18124,And that's if it was perfectly distributed (obviously not!
18125,"), along with everything else you have said."
18126,So we realistically are talking about a very low number.
18127,So no one at the school district studied probabilities or health.
18128,Good to know.
18129,"&gt;Infectious disease experts say that moving students around every few minutes is actually **more likely to increase transmission of the virus, by exposing more people to an infected student**."

18138,"Holy crap, I‚Äôm a mom too and I‚Äôm so sorry you have to deal with that horrible situation."
18139,&gt;the virus forces the body to put so much effort into fighting it that people who had it severe enough never got the anti-bodies to fight off reinfection.
18140,This is completely false.
18141,"Some *mild* cases had lower antibody titers, but not severe, unless you had some serious immune problems."
18142,Just ask Fauci
18143,"Wife is 36 weeks pregnant and is multi factor high risk, they told her to report on Monday."

18154,This is a terrible idea.
18155,Cats are very susceptible to respiratory diseases in general.
18156,It should not be of concern that your cat gives you covid.. rather that you could expose them to it if you have it.
18157,There has always been a recommendation to distance yourselves from your pets like you would ppl if you have symptoms.

18173,Correct.
18174,"Also, some of those 151k patients didn‚Äôt survive."
18175,Then there are privacy protections that might make it difficult to recover sequence data from an initial infection for confirmation upon reinfection.
18176,"No, I suspect that far fewer than 151k patients constitute the pool of patients for whom a confirmed reinfection is possible."
18177,"I have some preexisting conditions so even though I'm 28, I worry quite a bit about COVID."

18199,How many South and Central Americans does the CIA need to kill before you realize socialism is bad?
18200,Jeffrey Toobin has entered the chat.
18201,"Yes, it matters for proven cases."
18202,"If someone gets sick in March and then gets sick in November, we can't PROVE that it isn't just that the first infection was never fully beaten."
18203,"You can only show that it was a new, district reinfection if it is a different strain so that it can't be a lingering first infection."
18204,"So when you see the numbers about proven reinfections, they don't count it if it is the same strain."
18205,This is an example of how we are vastly undercounting reinfection cases.
18206,"That's horrible, given how few hospital beds rural areas have."
18207,"Speak the truth and people will start digging into your past and some how connect you to China, Russia or some billionaire and how you're part of a global conspiracy to control the masses or make Individual 1 look bad."

18217,June was almost half a year ago.
18218,Closer to the beginning than the end.
18219,&gt;&gt;You seem to be under the impression that we can stop or wipe out the virus.
18220,"&gt;
&gt;Not at all, what gave you that idea?"
18221,At least not until we get a vaccine or better treatments that substantially reduce severity / fatality.
18222,That's hoping and dreaming.
18223,Billions of people have livelihoods dying on the vine.
18224,&gt;&gt;So far [long term effects] are low probability and those same symptoms happen in other diseases as well.
18225,"&gt;
&gt;Huh?"
18226,We do NOT have long term data on the side effects I listed for in survivors.
18227,The virus literally hasn‚Äôt been around long enough for studies to have been run on that variable.
18228,"Most of the A-game scientists and resources are focused on vaccines, diagnosis, and survivability right now, not longitudinal studies."
18229,"If the same symptoms exist for other diseases (I would argue this combination has NOT been seen for others which makes this one so damn insidious), they‚Äôre not in anywhere near these numbers."
18230,Which is why it's weird people are saying long term symptoms are a major problem.
18231,They aren't.
18232,&gt;Get your head out of the sand and stop dismissing this with misinformation.
18233,It‚Äôs super not helpful.

18241,"Our covid stats are already getting much worse, so yes it's happening but it was inevitable."
18242,I am just reinforcing your point.
18243,But apparently you disapprove.
18244,I can't imagine the political rallies had any effect on that.
18245,This is the same argument as forcing old people to stay alive artificially in hospitals.
18246,"Would you rather stay alive for 6 months or a year in a hospital bed and then die, or die actually being where you enjoy?"
18247,"Its not about profit, its about letting these old people, who do NOT have much longer to live anyway enjoy the time they have left."
18248,"Believe it or not but isolation is not good for your mental health, and when you are old and robbed of your chance to see your children and grandchildren for a year or two (corona is here to stay) the question becomes wether or not it is moral to rob these people of one of the few things they may still enjoy in life."
18249,"You put on an act of caring, yet you do not give a shit about what the quality of life is for these people."
18250,"Its hell, and it is awful."
18251,"But hey, as long as theyre alive it doesnt matter if theyre suffering right?"
18252,"It is extremely age stratified, though, so the average is sort of meaningless."
18253,"&lt;30 years old should worry more about the flu, 60+ COVID is far worse."
18254,Middle age is sort of a wash.
18255,I can't stay home.

18259,I remember reading somewhere from a doctor in an older thread that the virus forces the body to put so much effort into fighting it that people who had it severe enough never got the anti-bodies to fight off reinfection.
18260,For now I'm hoping thats still the case otherwise we're dealing with one hell of a virus if it can just reinfect anyone.

18422,"I hear that a lot of hospital workers either didn‚Äôt get a raise, got their salaries cut, or lost their job entirely during the shutdown"
18423,"The article is not about young people partying, its about easing restrictions of old people."
18424,If you knew ANYTHING about the swedish elderly care it would be that the people who are put into are the people who do not have long left to live.
18425,"Only the people who cannot live by themselves, and basically require 24h surveillance are put into elderly homes here, otherwise you would recieve care at home."
18426,My mother has worked with these people for THIRTY years and has first hand experience on how it is affecting them.
18427,And its not good.
18428,"Stop putting words in my mouth i never advocated partying, i said that these people need to see their families for their mental health, but i guess you feel its alright to rob 80 and 90 year olds of the last months and years of their lives."
18429,And Israel had a second lock down in September too.
18430,So many people are going to get pissed the title says ‚Äúrare‚Äù üòÇ
18431,"I already watched that new documentary,   Totally under control, it was pretty depressing, not a ton of new information but a great reminder at how bad the US screwed up."
18432,I only just read about the diabetes trigger yesterday.

18436,Nope.
18437,"As I quoted before:

&gt;Even then, their samples were usually not preserved for genetic analysis, making it impossible to confirm suspected reinfections."
18438,And that's for PCR tests.
18439,"Antibody tests test for your own antibodies, not the virus."
18440,"So even if they retained it, there's no way for you to identify the strain that caused you to make antibodies."
18441,You simply cannot possibly be a confirmed reinfection if you get a reinfection.

18452,No other state comes that close to Canada.
18453,I'm not sure what it matters though?
18454,We aren't talking about nursing homes with 38 million or 39 million inhabitants.
18455,"Most of the population, both in Canada and California, does not live in a nursing home or work there."
18456,How does overall population size influence how a single nursing home can be managed?
18457,I really don't see the connection.
18458,What exactly prevents American for-profit nursing homes to be managed more like Canadian non-profit nursing homes so that less people die in them?
18459,Bonus points if you can make a link to population size.
18460,Huh.
18461,"So would it be fair to say that this pause, thought for several weeks, might not ultimately slow the process down in the US assuming overseas data is available?"
18462,What are the implication of this for the vaccines?
18463,It is.
18464,It's being echoed all over the place.
18465,Yet it's the #1 thing everywhere has in common as the cases rise all over the world.

18512,This is why America doesn‚Äôt trust any information anymore...
18513,Twitter would block your comment for spreading misinformation and lies.
18514,You are part of the reason why so many dead bodies are piling up.
18515,Put this on a T shirt.
18516,I guess you can test to see who already had hiv and figure out who may have been exposed to positive blood.
18517,But you could probably also just put everyone on the ARV treatment they offer rape victims since you won't be able to know with any degree of certainty who's actually exposed if even a single person tests positive
18518,I guess according to the downvotes.
18519,Are you suggesting mongols migrate?
18520,Wow that's a long time!
18521,I'm glad you're doing better (even if you're not 100%).
18522,I've heard a lot of stories similar to yours.
18523,"This virus is so  annoying üôÑ 

Thank you for the well wishes :)"
18524,I'm also talking about deaths vs total population.
18525,1 million out of almost 8 billion people is still about 0.01% and thats a low estimate given undiagnosed deaths and high count for global population etc etc.
18526,The fatality rate last I read was around 0.3-0.7%.
18527,0.00001% is a gross exaggeration and exactly why I mentioned not to downplay COVID-19.
18528,"With modern technology it has still made a statistically noticeable dent in population so while I do see it as a stretch comparing COVID-19 to the other pandemics purely based on number, pretending like it still isn't serious is wrong too."
18529,I get sick like once in 5 years.

18536,"If the evolutionary distance is great enough that the virus from the first infection couldn‚Äôt possibly have mutated into the second virus during the amount of time between infections, it‚Äôs considered confirmation of reinfection."
18537,"This is widely known, and also rather obvious."
18538,Why do we care about the nucleotide sequences at all?
18539,"Obviously, it‚Äôs to prove, beyond a shadow of a doubt, that these apparent reinfections aren‚Äôt in fact simply flare-ups of the initial infection."

18576,Florida went from 11k cases to 2.2k cases for 7 day daily average.
18577,Florida is now almost the full wild west state with everything wide open and yeehaws everywhere.
18578,Nfl teams seem to be only all owing small crowds even tho they can do full ones.
18579,It almost seems like Florida is trying to turn it into a bad flu season in our minds and focus on everything starting to be normal.
18580,Saying possibly stop daily reports.
18581,Don't typical flu years have 15 to 30k deaths a year?
18582,We're at 210k this year and still 3 months to go.
18583,It's not normal and ignoring it will make it worse.
18584,Like I can't remember any time so many people died in hospitals at once from a virus.
18585,"We hear about the major cities like Miami and NYC but a lot of areas are experiencing deaths in a way they're not used to 

Your death per day is 8 as it is lowest recently and Florida is in 80s."
18586,Death reports here have a good bit of delay before being reported and it's hard to see the true deaths every day

18594,They liked it.
18595,They want it to continue.
18596,Keep people unhappy and distracted from the shot they‚Äôre doing.
18597,"I work at a LTC Facility, when someone calls out suddenly we call staffing agencies to send over one of their nurses."
18598,In any given week we have 2-3 agency nurses in the facility filing in for staff that have called out.
18599,It's actually not that hard at all to fill a staffing hole with agency staff.
18600,"It's expensive to do so, the agency staff costs significantly more than hiring an on-site nurse, but, it's easily doable."
18601,"An older lady in the waiting room at the doctor's was asking me who made my shoes and she couldn't hear me, so I kept repeating myself and then she took off HER mask to hear me better ü§¶üèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èü§¶üèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è I just awkwardly turned around away from her"

18609,"Most people are very afraid of this virus, especially families with dependents."
18610,Economic demand in all markets will remain well below 2019 levels until the virus is cured.
18611,That‚Äôs the thing a lot of you aren‚Äôt getting.
18612,The statistics don‚Äôt matter to a lot of people.
18613,"We all see ourselves as ‚Äúat risk,‚Äù because yes young healthy people in their 20s and 30s have died from this period."
18614,"Even if it‚Äôs only at a 0.02% rate, doesn‚Äôt matter."
18615,"When you say ‚Äúat risk‚Äù people for all intents and purposes, that is everybody."
18616,I think you really underestimate the fear people have.
18617,Great scott.
18618,"If this is representative of the intelligence of the teaching staff, I really feel for the students."
18619,"This is actually a somewhat pointless argument to have with the people yelling ""rare!""."
18620,We'll never have an accurate count of confirmed coronavirus reinfections.
18621,What we will actually do is study a population of people who have a relatively high exposure level and are getting tested all the time (like health care workers) and establish a criteria like having 3-4 negative PCR tests and no symptomology between episodes as being sufficient to establish reinfection (vs. lingering viral debris).
18622,Then they'll fit a statistical model to that and determine how fast immunity wears off.
18623,"The actual number of confirmed reinfections will always remain ""rare"" even as the number of actual reinfections hits a million times the genetically sequenced confirmed cases."
18624,"Then there will be a ton of howling over the fact that there isn't 100% proof of reinfection in any of these cases, but that will either be a bad faith argument, or you'll be [arguing with people who literally can't think outside of black and white categories](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yts2F44RqFw)."
18625,It burned through.

18627,How bad was the death rate?
18628,Especially among the elderly and fragile?
18629,It‚Äôs not a flex.
18630,It‚Äôs a valid point.
18631,"Without the medical advancement, including birth control, our population might not skew so much to the elderly."
18632,Right?
18633,We need proper % of population breakdowns and by age to understand impacts.
18634,Ideally to also consider a general health of the person before they got sick.
18635,But some odd reason you rarely get that level of detail.
18636,Who knows maybe the guy was full of it.
18637,I guess only more real research is needed before we know since as far as I remember this was just 1 doctors observation/guess but as someone who already got infected the thought that it can happen again is just pure stress.
18638,"Just started using it again, got myself a disposable vape thats a mix of cbd and thc and a pipe and some free weed courtesy of my neighbor."
18639,"Been using it mostly because of stress and shit, but we'll see."
18640,I mean all anyone hears is about people still suffering what about the ones who recover within a week.
18641,Why dont they study us and see why we recovered so quickly with no long term side effects.
18642,"I‚Äôve had COVID twice: once in April, and then again in June."
18643,Tested negative for antibodies in May.
18644,Tested negative for COVID in July so I‚Äôm not shedding.

18654,That will teach you to wear sunscreen and long sleeves.
18655,Covid does mutate slower than influenza but faster than many other respiratory viruses‚Äî as to be expected from a positive sense single strand rna viruses prone to translation mistakes.
18656,We‚Äôve already seen quite a bit of variation between strains.
18657,It hasn‚Äôt been impactful enough to materially change our strategy wrt the spike protein but it‚Äôs pretty well accepted that it‚Äôs only a matter of time until we do see such a mutation.
18658,"Welcome to world media, that‚Äôs pretty much exactly what they do...."
18659,Crazy.
18660,I didn‚Äôt know how bad things were in EP.

18675,"Couple of days ago, with numbers rising like crazy, someone from the gov said they don't have a real plan for situation like one in which we are now."
18676,"They introduced some measures that, honestly, don't look too promising."
18677,And now this.
18678,I do hope things will get better and I do hope there won't be need for tight measures.
18679,But: it is really weird to see that goverment handles the situation in such a weird way.
18680,And even weirder is how freaking unprotected we all are - no matter where we live.

18704,The part where police detain and search thousands of people based on false positives from dogs is the part that violates their rights
18705,I live in Melbourne Australia where we had a very strict lockdown + masks.
18706,We‚Äôre now down from 700-800 daily cases to 1-4.
18707,Also the strep vaccine where the antibodies chewed up the heart valves and kidneys of canine subjects.

18724,Antibodies for COVID degrade *substantially* faster than antibodies produced for other corona viruses or respiratory viruses.
18725,"In the time between when you become infected and when you produce a tertiary immune response, you‚Äôre spreading the virus to other people."
18726,Memory cells are but one (apparently poorly understood by the public) factor in immune response.
18727,"For what it's worth, I agree with all of this."
18728,"When I talk about a conspiracy I'm referring to people like my colleague who actually thinks the left is funding the media agencies to get them to scare people, when in reality the media agencies know a fear driven agenda makes them the most money anyway, so they don't need the prodding."
18729,I've been disgusted with every corner of the media since March and now only really read some financial news and science journals.
18730,When are you gonna quit your conspiracy theories?
18731,"You are just making up this story in every thread that people said that the springs number are ""true""."
18732,"I doubt that even the most extreme person would say that the official number of infected was true back then  - how could they when only those sick enough to be admitted to the hospital, health care staff and some elderly were tested?"
18733,Which was a fact all around the world.
18734,If you believe that then you should stop for a moment and think.
18735,"And what are these ""dramatic improvements in treatments"" that makes people healthy even before they get admitted to the hospital?"
18736,And why aren't other countries using them?
18737,"The only thing I can think of are D-vitamin supplements, but I don't think everyone is munching on that."
18738,There's any studies proving this?
18739,I want to convince my parents to take vitamin supplements
18740,Our can't do attitude is exactly what brought us where we are.

18743,"I remember when UK and Melbourne, Australia had the same amount daily."
18744,We‚Äôre now down to 1-4 cases daily in a population of 4.5 million.
18745,Very thankful for living with someone competent in charge of my state!
18746,You are suggesting they put ‚Äòrandom garbage‚Äô in vaccines?
18747,For shits and giggles?
18748,"Again, it's different for different people."
18749,I'm not sure how many times I have to repeat this.
18750,"First of all, not a ‚Äúconspiracy theory‚Äù if it has been observed (read the link the other guy posted on it, it‚Äôs a real thing)."
18751,"Secondly, again, there is no proving whether it is or isn‚Äôt taking place until after the mortality wave is over - that‚Äôs built into the definition"
18752,lol
18753,"Yeah, it's not like lockdowns haven't worked in China, NZ, or Australia, and reduced deaths."
18754,"And it's not like NZ is heading back to normal, and China's economy improved 5% third qtr."
18755,"Nosiree, doesn't work at all."
18756,"The US is suffering because we never truly locked down, we gave individuals and small businesses minimal aid, we don't have medical care for everyone, and no one is willing to commit to the bare minimum of a mask mandate."
18757,That is why we are limping along with no end in sight.
18758,"Meanwhile, while Korea is seeing 100 cases or so a day, they're mostly back to normal."
18759,Same with Japan.
18760,But Americans can't even be bothered to do the bare minimum.
18761,Every participant is fully aware that there's a pretty big chance that they've received the placebo.
18762,"They're explicitly instructed to keep living as if they had not received any shot and to keep following rules and guidelines for disease prevention (hand washing, social distancing, etc...)."
18763,Saw that it was moatly young peopke getting the virus in LA county which probably explain the low death rate in comparison
18764,Lies smfh
18765,What risk?
18766,The risk of harmful side effects is really quite low.
18767,"The risk of getting the disease almost certainly is lower for participants than the general public since it is likely that the vaccine is better than nothing,  whether or not it is good enough."
18768,Jesus christ.
18769,"Population-adjusted, that'd be over 130k in the US, if you were wondering."
18770,"Is this the single largest ""official"" one-day increase of any country in the world, per capita?"
18771,Or maybe France has beaten this recently?
18772,Edit: it's been pointed out to me that several other countries have this beat already.

18779,No.
18780,Not me.
18781,Their boss.
18782,"If there was a way to get food and medicine to me without risking the health and well-being of others, I would do it."
18783,Maybe these fictional people who *don‚Äôt* think it‚Äôs a risk to their health should do it?
18784,&gt;  How elitist of you.
18785,"‚ÄúI want to go to Disney World during a pandemic because what I want is more important than the health of others!‚Äù

So if my opinion is ‚Äúelitist,‚Äù what the fuck is yours?"
18786,"Elitist and hypocritical, clearly."
18787,&gt; Wait earlier when I said going to work was too risky and we should lockdown you agreed.
18788,So why don't you just do that yourself?
18789,Why don‚Äôt I do what?
18790,Lock down?
18791,I only leave my house to go to work.
18792,"And that‚Äôs only because I can‚Äôt work from home, because I work in the service industry, and people just can‚Äôt seem to agree on what is considered ‚Äúessential‚Äù and what isn‚Äôt."
18793,"I‚Äôm open to suggestion, though."

18802,"Which I'm pretty sure **isn't** the case, so long as I don't have to deal with my pediatrician's parking garage and its rage inducing fellow drivers."
18803,(Har har)
18804,Must be drumpfs fault
18805,I think a message right now of ‚Äúnormal life will perhaps be possible in 2024‚Äù is more likely to make people go ‚Äúfuck it‚Äù and pack in bars.
18806,Why does it sound bad?
18807,The trials are not focused on children right now.
18808,"If we want kids to return to school in person next year, it is important to identify whether these vaccines work on them so we can start vaccinating children in 2021 too."
18809,We have not advanced as far as you seem to think... we still rely on vaccines.
18810,"Now granted, part of why the Spanish flu pandemic lasted so long was because there was no vaccine but that same logic can‚Äôt be applied to 1957, 1968, or 2009 with H1N1 and each of those pandemics lasted well over a year."
18811,Your assumption that technological advances haven‚Äôt been factored in is incorrect‚Äî they‚Äôve been factored in but are negligible given the conditions.
18812,The US does get more sunlight on average in comparison to europe so that should slow the spread
18813,Are these really volunteers or financially compensated ‚Äúvolunteers‚Äù?
18814,You're overly aggressive about a hypothetical.
18815,Have you thought about seeing a therapist?
18816,Although there's no real cure for being a cunt.
18817,Criticizing politicians fueling anti vaccine ideas is partisan?
18818,I‚Äôll call out anyone when the situation warrants it.

18820,The bubonic plague.

18826,I‚Äôm asking about what the time period is....
18827,"If you don‚Äôt know, don‚Äôt comment"
18828,Well it is actually possible to die from a vaccine.
18829,"Not necessarily likely, but in these early state trials anything is possible."
18830,I can‚Äôt believe you in good conscience can say that only 1% of the country has been exposed.
18831,As an epidemiologist or virologist you can‚Äôt possibly believe that.
18832,"It‚Äôs not like you have to go full Ioannidis, but in reality it‚Äôs closer to 10%."
18833,Maybe it‚Äôs 1% if you only count people with antibodies currently in their system.
18834,"Even if they did get the vaccine, it could just mean that their illness was already advanced or there were other factors."
18835,One outlier doesn't mean the vaccine is worthless.
18836,"I believe it's [X] events, then they unblind."
18837,"If it's 100 events, they'll then look at what percentage were in each arm."
18838,"Maybe we should find a way to make restaurants safer (air filters, masks when not sitting, etc."
18839,).
18840,I believe the trial protocol requires a certain number of symptomatic infections in the entire trial group.
18841,"At that point, data is unblinded (at least partially) and researchers get to see the breakdown of cases between placebo and vaccine groups and draw their conclusions."
18842,"From the [trial protocol](https://s3.amazonaws.com/ctr-med-7111/D8110C00001/52bec400-80f6-4c1b-8791-0483923d0867/c8070a4e-6a9d-46f9-8c32-cece903592b9/D8110C00001_CSP-v2.pdf):

&gt; An interim efficacy analysis will be conducted when approximately 75 events meeting the primary endpoint definition have been reported across the active and control groups within the population of participants who are not seropositive at baseline, which will give &gt; 70% power to detect a VE of 70% and &gt;90% power to detect a VE of 75%."
18843,"This is for an interim readout, which should give a pretty high chance to provide enough data to detect if the vaccine is quite effective (the VE 70% and VE 75% figures)."
18844,"But if the vaccine is only, say, 50% effective, then it's likely that this interim readout doesn't result in a large enough difference in infection counts between control and vaccine groups."
18845,I had to look it up by region in the US.
18846,I'm in SF and our positivity rate has been below 1 percent throughout last week.
18847,I feel very much detached from what's going on elsewhere in the US.
18848,Sigh.
18849,[removed]
18850,So when Biden finally does something are you going to say it‚Äôs for the greater good or whine like a baby bc pointless bars are going to go out of business?
18851,i would think that if they recommended you not eat before the test you should have listened to the directions.
18852,I really fail to understand the point of giving placebo in a **vaccine** trial.
18853,"So basically they lied to this person saying, ""We gave you a dose of the vaccine that will hopefully protect you against the virus,"" and sent him on his way."
18854,Maybe I'm too dumb to understand the merit of this anyone care to explain?
18855,Love it that thousands of people are unemployed?
18856,New Zealand just had another outbreak of coronavirus.
18857,I hope they don't need to do another lockdown.
18858,Or maybe they're trying to keep up the pressure so thousands more don't die becayse theeoneleads can't be arsed to stay away from bars?
18859,"In double blind studies, volunteers and clinical personnel don't know wheter it is placebo or not but researchers do indeed know who got placebo."
18860,"Had this been a triple blind study, researchers too wouldn't know who got what."
18861,It's different but that doesn't make antigenic shift the sole reason why this vaccine won't be effective.
18862,"It may be the reason why vaccines will be more effective with time as it allows us more time to focus in on the most effective vaccine, but no matter how effective your vaccine is, it'll still be mainly limited by the health of the immune system it's being introduced to."
18863,"Yours was a higher comment in the thread so I saw it first, the information was appreciated!"
18864,"Dude, that is one of the best analogies/metaphors for that that I've ever heard so far."
18865,"Totally going to use that/steal that, hope you don't mind!"
18866,Yes.
18867,I got stopped by the police every day going to work and had to show them papers attesting I was going to work.
18868,"You could only go out to work (essential workers only), buy food or medicine, or for health reasons (like going to the hospital)."
18869,In some cities they followed runners with drones ffs.
18870,"Also grocery shopping has never been a big source of infection here, since you're supposed to wear mask and gloves and practice social distancing at all times, even while queueing."
18871,During the lockdown only a few people were allowed in the shop at the same time (e.g.
18872,for a small shop maximum 5 people allowed).
18873,"What are, words from a mass murderer?"
18874,How is dogs sniffing a violation of people's right?
18875,"No judgement whatsoever, I'm just curious of what right they should not violate"
18876,Trust no one's going to make strategic decisions based on a Twitter post.
18877,One death does not a pandemic make.
18878,This pandemic is certainly peeling back the curtain on something that happens all the time in science: disagreement!
18879,It's just that now it's happening on a very public and global scale.
18880,"I respect Dr. Bhattacharya's work on health economics and the cost of social isolation among older adults, but I disagree with much of what he says about how we should handle this pandemic."
18881,"Please let us know if you do, and also if you were on the placebo or not"
18882,Or that could just be a figure of speech and the poster doesn't actually carry around an oxygen meter when taking the Japanese subway.
18883,What's the cutoff?
18884,Anyone else notice the one little county in Nevada that apparently has nothing happening to it even though it is surrounded by a sea of red?
18885,It's those type of places that make me skeptical about the accurate COVID-19 numbers.
18886,Or I'm just paranoid and its inhabited.
18887,&gt; Vietnam with 2.5x the population has had about half the cases as Canada has had deaths.
18888,And there could be a bajillion reasons for that.
18889,The Democratic Republic of Congo did even better than China!
18890,It must be because of their masterful handling of the situation.
18891,Western Sahara too.
18892,China should be asking *them* for advice!
18893,And again an altered headline from you.
18894,You would think wearing a mask was literal torture equivalent to putting pins in your eyes with how much people refuse to do it.

18935,It does seem like they somehow managed to rise to the challenge and erect a distribution network while simultaneously plugging away at manufacturing the vaccine.
18936,I've read it and I'm not sure how you think it applies here.
18937,"In my opinion there's always been a fundamental difference between ""real conspiracies"" and faux media viral conspiracy crap like bigfoot, and that's the same today."
18938,"The difference is that false conspiracies are easy to understand, entertaining to be knowledgeable of, and comforting in the short term to the sense of fear and desire for control."
18939,They're palatable and universal.
18940,Real conspiracies like tax evasion and election meddling require more specialized knowledge of how they're supposed to work to understand how and why they're going wrong.
18941,"Nobody wants to google that or share it on Facebook, and it's certainly more difficult to repeat at a backyard BBQ."

18944,"It's not a conspiracy to believe some company is trying to form an unregulated monopoly and is using politicians to do it, it's just business."
18945,The question is whether they're pulling it off or if the system is acting as it should to stop it.

18949,"The biggest reasons are:

* There might be selection bias in who was included in the trial."
18950,Collecting one group of people and splitting them at random makes it maximally likely that you‚Äôre comparing two groups of otherwise similar people.
18951,(This is why you can‚Äôt just compare against some other group of people not included in the trial.)
18952,* People‚Äôs behavior might change after they‚Äôre included in the trial (e.g.
18953,they go out and party assuming they were in the treatment group).
18954,"Again, having the placebo group ensures you have a group of similarly-behaving people to compare against."
18955,(This is why you actually have to give everyone an injection: you don‚Äôt want people behaving differently based on whether or not they got the vaccine.)

18973,Still appreciated!
18974,The placebo effect is such an interesting/weird concept.
18975,Hard to believe it can produce benefits.
18976,This I did not realize.
18977,Here was the other explanation I found in this thread: https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/jfh1e6/brazil_says_a_28yearold_volunteer_in_astrazenecas/g9k6aei/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf&amp;context=3
18978,False positives definitely can cause problems.
18979,Let's say a test can identify a covid-infected person as positive with 99% but it also says positive for 5% of healthy people.
18980,Right now it seems like there's about 1% of all world (or less) sick of covid (google gave me this).
18981,"So if you take 1000 people and test them, 10 are going to be infected and marked correctly as positive, and then of the 990 healthy ones 50 more will be marked as positive."
18982,"So now there are 60 people who have tested positively for the virus, which we know is 6 times more than the actual number."
18983,"This in larger scale can lead to economies dying because many more people had to stay quarantined than was necessary, which might even end up as a bigger problem than the virus itself."
18984,So that is one reason why false positives can be a problem.
18985,This article is being plastered everywhere and most people only see the headline.
18986,This is very counterproductive.
18987,Canada is looking for cheap labor.
18988,Americans usually do not fit that mold.
18989,"Any plan that relies on ""if people would just do X"" is likely to fail."
18990,NYC would like to have a word.
18991,It‚Äôs just so sad to me to see other college students be so okay with the lockdown and distance learning without realizing that they‚Äôre the ones that are going to be the most affected long-term from this.
18992,If remote learning is a thing next year then thousands of kids are going to be graduating into the worst recession in 90 years with no real connections and will realize very quickly that those ‚Äúfriendships‚Äù they made through discord aren‚Äôt real friendships.
18993,"And decades from now they‚Äôll look back on their early 20‚Äôs and see that they were wasted and they didn‚Äôt get to experience many of the things they wanted to, and willingly accepted it."
18994,So let's say you get the flu.
18995,"Lungs are full of crap, you're hacking and wheezing, but surviving."
18996,Your body is fighting it off successfully but it's going to take another week or so for the bulk of your symptoms to disappear.
18997,Your doctor wants you to come in and get evaluated to make sure you're progressing as expected and you agree because you have great medical insurance.
18998,"On the way to the doctor's office, you get in a car accident and suffer some internal bleeding (i.e."
18999,"ruptured spleen) that doesn't get detected right away because of your flu symptoms (heart rate already erratic, lungs making noise that mask the noise of any bleeding, body aches and pains from the flu, etc)."
19000,You die.
19001,It is a vehicle death or a flu death?
19002,"I mean, you had an underlying condition (the flu) which complicated what happened so by the position you seem to be taking, the flu is what killed you."
19003,"However, if it hadn't been for the car accident, you would have survived."
19004,This is why death certificates have multiple lines so they can list ALL of the influencing factors.
19005,There's also a difference between CAUSE and MECHANISM of death.
19006,"For people that have underlying conditions and die from COVID, the cause is COVID and the mechanism is that the COVID exacerbated the underlying conditions to the point where the patient died."
19007,"If it hadn't been for COVID, the underlying conditions would not have been exacerbated and the patient wouldn't have died as soon as they did."

19049,"They said they will independently review the vaccine, not that vaccines are bad."
19050,The skepticism around the politicization of the CDC and FDA isn't something that began in the last few days.
19051,How many times during this pandemic has the CDC had their guidelines altered to something more politically palatable?
19052,"There is little doubt over the expertise of those organizations, but there is concern over their independence."
19053,"Lol no, even Spanish flu a virus that is 100 times more severe to the young healthy age group did not rank the economy when countries just let the virus spread, all they did back then was advices and guidelines on what public could do they might be helpful to slow the spread."
19054,The first lockdown already led the global economy into worst recorded recession ever.
19055,"For quite a lot of countries not even world war is this harmful to the economy, letting the virus spread will tank the economy more than shut down is complete false, a pure conspiracy theory."
19056,Most recent example is Florida shows far lower unemployment than shut down business California.
19057,He only said that to get people to vote at the elections (and for than you need to literally drag your ass to the polls).
19058,"And it was directed at voters of his own right wing party, especially the elderly who during lockdown were repeatedly told to stay at home and not risk their lives."
19059,But elections came and this important voting demographic needed to be convinced that all is good now.
19060,It wasn't good then and it's not good now.

19062,"Yep, once there's a vaccine there's going to be a lot of resistance to mask-wearing."

19155,But it's something researchers/scientists/public health have to re-evaluate going forward.
19156,1% is 8x less than 8%.
19157,It‚Äôs not a negligible difference.
19158,It frustrates me that you‚Äôre willing to use projections for some things but not others.
19159,To use serological testing for some things but not others.
19160,"The reality is that for every COVID positive test there‚Äôs at least two, probably more, that were missed because of a lack of testing."
19161,It‚Äôs completely irresponsible of you to say that only 1% of the country has had covid and it makes me question everything you say.
19162,"So it‚Äôs not that they won‚Äôt do anything, it‚Äôs that you don‚Äôt want them to do anything."
19163,And if they do you‚Äôll complain.

19174,The trip is non negotiable.
19175,Have any of you flown recently?
19176,What was your approach to it?

19178,Your insight would be greatly appreciated.
19179,Two things to bear in mind: I am high risk on two fronts and this trip is not optional.
19180,Cheers!
19181,Maybe...
19182,The question wasn't so much whether kids would be okay as it was about the teachers/staff and the effect on community transmission.
19183,"It's undoubtedly has lead to more community transmission, however it doesn't seem to have caused significant spikes at this point."
19184,Opening schools was probably the right thing to do.

19188,It already went Gold so no more delays.
19189,Plenty of dirt for six feet under ;)
19190,So one of the largest case increases we have seen but still lower deaths and hospitalizations than the first wave?
19191,Did the virus mutate into something less severe?
19192,?
19193,No.
19194,"Today's hiv testing methods can deliver results within 6 weeks by now, via a quick test u can buy even on Amazon, blood tests work quicker."
19195,Also hiv is very well treatable and you don't die from it nor can you spread it anymore.
19196,There is a medication called PrEP that loweres the virus concentration in your blood up to point you can't spread it.
19197,This medicine can also be taken on demand or after a sexual risk contact.
19198,Source: I work in HIV/sti prevention for the biggest German Organisation in that field.
19199,Scariest part of that is the ‚Äúunknown‚Äù
19200,"I don't think the virus or community transmission is ever going away since it presents with no symptoms in so many infected people, but a vaccine, improved treatment and better tracing means that won't matter."
19201,There's a lot of people who seem to think restrictions should stay in place until the virus is eliminated which is unlikely and unsustainable.
19202,But once the risk of hospitals being overwhelmed decreases significantly there's no reason for the average person to worry.

19311,I was fed the lie the college was supposed to be the best time of my life and I think that made me depressed when I wasn't out partying and making friends.

19313,"It's simply false, and you've provided zero evidence to back it up."
19314,By 90% of metrics of US is far from number 1.
19315,"You have GDP (if you only look at gross and ignore per capita or territory size), Military spending (I wouldn't consider a military state a great place to live) and population (number 3, so not ""dominating"")."
19316,By any measure that has a direct effect on a citizens quality of life the US doesn't come close to dominating.

19323,"But if we just vaccinate the 5% with a serious risk of hospitalisation or death first, then we will see far less stress on the healthcare system and far lower mortality."
19324,Some easing of restrictions could be considered at that point.
19325,"When they say the vaccine might be only 50% effective, it will still reduce severity in the other 50%&gt;"
19326,Yes that's a possibility under a particular circumstance (care home in a massively at risk area).
19327,The Astrazenica vaccine is the one I'm referencing and outside of the Sinovac which is the one being rolled out in China none of them will be available fully approved this year.
19328,The Pfizer vaccine can be used at the end of November in America subject to its final stage fast track approval under emergency authorisation.
19329,But this is slightly different to a mass vaccination program I was talking about.
19330,Fortunately it's looking better and better everyday and without getting ahead of ourselves is 90% chance we will have a working vaccine program early next year.
19331,"&gt;This is never going to go away, even with a COVID vaccine."
19332,"I'm not saying you're wrong, but you're definitely wrong to be so confident."
19333,"Singapore, most of Australia, NZ, China, Vietnam, Thailand, and Taiwan have all got rid of Covid to all intents and purposes ‚Äî without a vaccine."
19334,"If a vaccine can depress transmission then yes, it'll still take a concerted effort to get rid of it (or at least to depress transmission in the way that TB is just not a concern for the west) but I wouldn't say it's a permanent fixture with a high level of danger and transmission."

19385,It's about to get really weird this holiday season.
19386,Probably no way of knowing if they shared the same spike protein or attacked the circulatory system though I'm guessing.
19387,I wonder if it is possible for Sars2Cov to even lose the spike protein that it has obtained over time or artificially.
19388,If there's no incentive for it to lose it I would think it would keep on partying in its current state.
19389,"Experiments visualising the airflow when breathing, speaking and laughing, show that wearing a mask indoors can drastically reduce the risk of transmission of airborne particles."
19390,"Without a mask, breath is ejected from the lungs to form a secondary plume in front of the host, increasing the risk of exposure for others."
19391,"When wearing a mask, the secondary plume is no longer formed and the airborne particles instead move upwards to the upper layer of the room where they can be safely removed by a ventilation system."

19396,"The data available so far indicate that indoor transmission of the virus far outstrips outdoor transmission, possibly due to longer exposure times and the decreased turbulence levels (and therefore dispersion) found indoors."

19445,The prime minister and his party are to blame for thousands of preventable deaths that are to come.

&gt;One in seven people is ill for at least four weeks


&gt;One in 20 people is ill for at least eight weeks


&gt;One in 45 people is ill for at least 12 weeks

19457,"So I'm here now and they told me that while they are not able to tell me which group I'm in while the study is ongoing, if a vaccine becomes publicly available I can receive it."
19458,"So if I did receive the vaccine, the extra doses wouldn't have a negative effect."
19459,I'm sure that would kick me out of the study though.
19460,So I'll have to weigh out which is more important.
19461,Literally the only chance we have of getting out of 2021 or 2022 without masks all the fucking time.
19462,"Hilariously the second my states mask mandate was allowed to expire, despite the signs still on every store door, people have just stopped wearing them."
19463,It‚Äôs just so sad that this is the life these people choose.
19464,That's what they are testing in the efficacy trials.
19465,We won't know until the trial is  over but I can imagine at the very least we would see some level of immunity that would at least make covid-19 act like another common cold coronavirus.
19466,Doing nothing isn't the US method.
19467,Doing nothing **and** aggressively campaigning that partially closing the borders to China for a couple weeks 8 months ago was a genius intervention.

19479,Also odd in Washington‚Äôs case considering the size of the Chinese community there and how much travel back and forth there must have been in December - January.

19483,"I mean a lot of people can't wear masks for a variety of reasons, not just because they simply don't want to, so that is an unrealistic goal."
19484,Thank you!
19485,It all depends on whether it's something people can get as luck of the draw through a poor immune system or whether all immunity runs out after a certain point.
19486,If it's A then that sucks and it's probably going to keep targetting that group of people until there's a vaccine.

* get more funds and equipment for healthcare
* some kind of a system of tests on the borders (even measuring temperature would be great)
* enforce mask wearing more efficiently
* do not make a fucking illegal compulsory 2 week quarantine in questionable ""state quarantine centers"" and that was in the first wave (= half-fallen dormitories)

19951,Even if you do you are no better than the bosses at Disney who want to reopen.
19952,I am sure they are not calling for reopening without those protections.
19953,Not if you are still going to work.

19955,Another strawman?

19989,After a few more waves it should become substantially less lethal
19990,"Plus, it's not just the antibodies."
19991,"While the initial antibodies may only last a few months, memory cells can stick around for a much longer time and provide a much better immune response if reinfection occurs."

19993,"Economic destruction, social unrest, a corrupt government using the crisis as a lifeboat and still up to 50 deaths a day in a tiny country?"

20032,I wonder if there are mean spirited political actions against the prime minister.
20033,I don‚Äôt see a national fine for no mask working.
20034,The people who enforce that will not take it seriously because their union endorses the idiot who has made mask wearing a political issue.

20128,"Um... We're past the point of no return because testing is so low that stopping the virus smartly using just self isolation is not an option, so..."
20129,Pretty much everyone would get the virus.

20135,The vast majority never have and will never do that for the flu

20138,"Didn't know that, thanks!"
20139,"Yep,

I realised the other day the the initial lockdown the UK had for 4 months was a complete waste of time and money."
20140,We're back to square one.
20141,The only thing I can see that works is to keep folks away from each other.
20142,This means sacrificing hospitality and anywhere folks meet up until we have a vaccination.
20143,"Trying to do half measures, such as meeting up in groups of 6 in a restaurant don't work."

20145,Go away
20146,"Science says that we don't know what the long-term effects are &amp; that some young healthy people are not only dying, but also showing signs of damage that they don't even notice (even in those that show zero symptoms)."
20147,Claiming otherwise shows a complete lack of understanding of the definition of what science is.
20148,That's not even factoring in the fact that people that aren't scared of it for themselves (aka selfish or uneducated) definitely aren't scared for their ability to kill others as a spreader.

20154,"But then, one case could become many when that one person infects others while out..."
20155,It probably means the person got the placebo rather than the actual vaccine
20156,"I mean wearing masks every year during flu season might become the norm, Covid-19 could become endemic and flare up like the flu each year."
20157,&gt; I'm happy to wear a mask until there's a vaccine but why would I wear one after getting vaccinated?
20158,I don't wear a mask if I get the flu vaccine.
20159,You must never wear a seatbelt either.
20160,By your reasoning seatbelts are dangerous because the number of people who died in motor vehicle accidents *while* wearing a seatbelt has gone up since 1968.

20162,"Wants not needs, bruh."

20169,You would expect a sharp increase around the time of the rallies if they had an effect.
20170,Have to remember testing has dramatically increased in Italy and also the rest of the world.
20171,Highly likely most countries were seeing far higher numbers than officially reported back in March.
20172,I mean most countries are probably still missing cases now just not as much as they were in March
20173,Seems like they already started because today's numbers aren't out yet and they're never this late.

20185,"If that's the case, then I was wrong about you."
20186,I can't be mad about you being a better person than I first thought.

20188,If they haven‚Äôt paused the trial I would assume it‚Äôs a placebo.

20196,"Yeah, see ninja edit."
20197,I may have misunderstood what part you were disagreeing with.
20198,I‚Äôm sure that if they thought that this was in any related to the vaccine they would pause the trial.
20199,They likely already know that this person received the placebo.
20200,Edited due to seeing info in another article stating cause of death was Covid complications.

20204,Coming to CBS in late December.
20205,Neither would explain the nearly nonexistent flu activity.
20206,But flu R0 is about 1.3 while covid is 2.5 or so.
20207,Interventions to reduce covid spread could reduce flu below 1 and prevent an outbreak.
20208,How is this different from diabetes caused by the flu or other viruses?
20209,lol
20210,Lol yes you are

20219,"Weird that you‚Äôre downvoting me for being civil and pointing out where you‚Äôre mistaken, I‚Äôm doing you a service here."
20220,Also weird that you would rely on Pfizer (of all companies) to only put out a vaccine that‚Äôs a minimum of ‚Äú76.9% effective‚Äù based on a PR release when 1) Pfizer has a substantial sunk cost in human trials and has a legal obligation to shareholders to pursue an ROI on those trials so long as the FDA is willing to approve and 2) it‚Äôs nearly impossible to determine efficacy with usual statistical significance without a challenge trial.
20221,You‚Äôre just way out of your depth on this subject.
20222,"Reference:

Neuropilin-1 is a host factor for SARS-CoV-2 infection

20223,Yes I will.
20224,I can do shit in private with friends and family.
20225,I saw no one from March until beginning of September.
20226,Yeah But it hasn't leap from mink to mink.
20227,"The point is if we erradicate it in humans using a vaccine and the virus hasn't figured a way to transmit (mink to mink for exampe), that will not be a stable reservoir."
20228,The thing I'm concerned about is the origin of the virus and we need to know where it comes from to prevent it from leaping again from that species (bat?)
20229,.
20230,"Yeah shift Europe‚Äôs graph over two or three weeks to the right, it will look familiar."
20231,I agree.
20232,I'm just saying the story doesn't end when the first vaccine gets rolled out.
20233,"However much we all want this to be over, it's going to take time."
20234,"When the time has passed and the data is in, we can decide what's acceptable."

20237,Thank you!
20238,There's reports of people developing new onset type 1 diabetes that are considerably older than we typically associate that with though.
20239,I read about a 28 year old suddenly developing type 1 diabetes after covid yesterday.
20240,This would definitely complicate vaccine efforts.
20241,What killed him?
20242,Did he have covid before?
20243,A 28 year old doen't just die from a placebo.
20244,Lol delusional
20245,Any proof behind that claim?
20246,Holy fuck dude.
20247,You cannot be serious.

20268,yikes...
20269,It seems to be working.
20270,6 months an ZERO covid death in China.
20271,"I mean, that should give everyone a huge boost of trust, raaight?"
20272,This is difficult to watch unfold.
20273,I know several people in Europe in Ireland and Spain and they are just crushed by the prospect of additional lockdowns.
20274,"According to them, people are upset and scared, not understanding why the previous extended lockdowns ""didn't work."""
20275,"Unfortunately, lockdowns only delay the inevitable, and they could not continue until an effective vaccine had been fully deployed."
20276,"Hopefully we get that effective vaccine deployed soon, because this is just rough."
20277,&gt; seems like there isn't much improvement in therapy for the worst cases.
20278,I‚Äôd say dexamethasone has been an immense improvement.
20279,We‚Äôve gone from ~40% mortality for ventilated patients to ~30%.
20280,"That‚Äôs still bad in absolute terms, but a massive improvement over April, and that‚Äôs certainly contributing to the lower mortality rate"
20281,Everyone SANE who ran a recreation business bailed out in March or April.
20282,Those who dug in will push a psychopathic herd mentality agenda because they spent all summer ~losing money~ and are now losing ~even more~ money just by being open.
20283,Their businesses ultimately will vanish not because of coronavirus ordinances but normal market forces anyone with an elementary grasp of global affairs knew was coming minimum 6-7 months ago.
20284,So ultimately all these bar owners trying to kill their own customers in order to stay afloat are going to fail anyway.
20285,That whole sector isn‚Äôt coming back til after a vaccine exists.
20286,Why make the pain worse?
20287,Why make your debt worse?
20288,What‚Äôs the point?
20289,Yeah some people keep their jobs but they can do other jobs.
20290,There‚Äôs lots of work that needs to be done.
20291,"The only way out of this mess has always been a Great Depression like mobilization of every level of society, people briefly changing careers to back up the wartime production act, etc."
20292,"But no, you want everyone to share virus everywhere so someone can keep a job?"
20293,That‚Äôs not much different from the lies nazi collaborators told themselves.
20294,It‚Äôs typically American though.
20295,You can‚Äôt think of one solution that solves every single aspect of problem at the same time so you argue we shouldn‚Äôt do anything at all.
20296,"Treatment is better than it used to be, yes, but still, lockdowns hurt us and I refuse to admit that they were worth it, because next thing you know we‚Äôll be locking down for the flu"
20297,"Its more complicated than this, If you just shut down schools you can lose a significant portion of your health care workers."

20306,For the purposes of vaccine approval it would be best if he was on the placebo because that would be more evidence that the vaccine is working for those that it was given to.
20307,"But each vaccine has a certain number of weeks that it takes before it becomes fully effective, whatever that happens to mean."
20308,So if he contracted covid before that timeline was met then it won't have a huge impact on the study.
20309,For example one of the vaccines being tested in the US requires two doses like 28 days apart or something so if someone caught covid after the first dose but before the second then their result would not be taking into as much consideration because the full dosage was not given to them by that point
20310,That's simply not true.
20311,Stop spreading misinformation
20312,True.
20313,That's the long term equilibrium we're shooting for.

20320,"They aren't giving any clear information about the death, that's not a relief at the moment."
20321,"""Anvisa gave no further details on the death, citing confidentiality protocols."""
20322,We just had a boat turn up.with 24 infected crew members off the coast of Perth.
20323,It's quite possible to start with one infected person at the start of the trip and end up with more recently infected people by the end and hence more likely to be infectious by the end of the trip and able to spread it if not picked up at a potential disembarking.
20324,The reason not to use them is obvious.
20325,I would deliberately infect myself for a chance to play with a cute dog in the middle of lockdown.
20326,Do you know how the Flu spreads?
20327,How would wearing masks not help?
20328,***Stonks go down***
20329,Death is likely not a side effect of the vaccine.
20330,"Imagine they're testing on 100,000 people worldwide, in 2 groups of 50,000."
20331,"Base probability of getting the virus is 10% (we would expect 5,000 in the placebo group to get it)."
20332,"Then, with a unweighted IFR of 0.8%, we would expect 40 people to pass away."
20333,"Then, assume the vaccine is 70% effective; instead of 5,000 people, 1,500 people get the virus."
20334,"Then, the vaccine boosts your immune system so that if you get it, the IFR is 50% lower."
20335,That means maybe 7-8 people would pass away.
20336,Math is simplified but that's the gist.
20337,"Could care less about masks but Social Distancing has had an awful effect globally on peoples livelihoods and mental health, this has gotten ridiculous"
20338,"Noooooooooo

Please guys."
20339,Let's fix this
20340,"Then surely it means it's not vaccine related, right?"
20341,If they were worried then they would've done the same thing they did back in september.
20342,It makes no sense to pause all trials for an unexplained case of transverse myelitis and not do the same in the case of death.
20343,I hope they disclose more information soon.
20344,His ass.
20345,Asians wear it because of toxic pollution.
20346,"They're not that much different from the west, they're not germaphobes."
20347,Where did they say that?
20348,Nowhere.
20349,They are just reporting what numbers have been reported to them.
20350,"No one knows for sure why those 100,000 others died."
20351,I‚Äôm sure not ALL are directly related to covid; like you said swamped hospitals left some people unable to get the care they needed which is indirectly attributed to the pandemic anyway.
20352,"Point being without covid most of those 100,000 almost certainly wouldn‚Äôt be dead"
20353,[deleted]
20354,&gt;We are discussing if the current development is a wave or not.
20355,"No, I am pointing out that the actual data proves without a doubt that there is a second wave happening, while you are referring to imaginary data that you are inventing to justify your denial of that fact."
20356,"&gt; No matter what, Sweden is not (yet) anywhere near the **real** numbers we had in March/April 

No, they are imaginary numbers."
20357,"Tell me... what is the difference between the reported numbers and your ""real"" numbers?"
20358,"1%, 50%, 100%?"
20359,"You have no idea at all what the ""real numbers"" are because they are a fiction you are creating in your mind."
20360,"The only numbers we can state categorically are the reported numbers, and the reported numbers now are higher than any time prior to June."
20361,"&gt;  second wave should be similar to the first 

Nope."
20362,"Put simply, a second wave is a reversal of a downward trend into an upward trend."
20363,The magnitude of the wave is essentially irrelevant.
20364,"The simple fact is, the first wave came to and end in late May and the number of new cases began to drop, despite the number of tests increasing."
20365,"Then in the beginning of September the number of new cases per day began to increase, and it has been increasing ever since."
20366,That is a second wave... period.

20372,Inconceivable
20373,Cheaper to buy something from the dollar menu at McDonald's than buying a salad.
20374,I read everywhere that coronavirus is mostly spread through close contact and surfaces are not thought to be a main mode.
20375,Is this true for all viruses or just coronavirus in particular?
20376,I‚Äôm asking because my son recently caught a cold and the only place we go is the playground and he doesn‚Äôt play with other kids so this was clearly a surface contact situation.
20377,I thought playgrounds would be ok since they‚Äôre outdoors but now I‚Äôm nervous to continue taking him because obviously not touching surfaces at a playground is impossible.
20378,So what I‚Äôm looking for is - is this coronavirus just not as hearty as some other cold viruses or what‚Äôs the deal?
20379,Don't hold your breath.
20380,Remember when it was going to be rolling out in early Fall?

20390,Welcome to modern media
20391,The vaccine(s) are 5 months away for the general public in Western Nations.
20392,"Before the end of this year (in the next 4-8 weeks), it is very likely that a frontrunner candidate will apply and be granted EUA."
20393,Doses have been mass produced since the Spring/Summer and will be deployed ASAP after approval.
20394,Once the most vulnerable have been vaccinated then that's a big chunk of the problem.
20395,"Im a Psychology student and that is the same for the patients that I will meet, it will definitely get worst before it gets better"
20396,True.
20397,Also getting a flu shot is still generally good for reducing the severity of the flu since the your body still somewhat recognizes the virus.
20398,"It's also suspected to reduce your viral load if you have the flu, which means you'll spread it less."
20399,Ideally it prevents the flu... but less severity means a higher chance of recovery.
20400,It's not only old and sick people who die of the flu.
20401,Young healthy people sometimes just suddenly develop critical symptoms and die in an alarmingly sudden way.
20402,"One morning you just feel like you have the flu, and in the afternoon you're in the ICU while a doctor talks to your family about your odds of recovery."
20403,Seriously people: get your flu shot.
20404,"It's not just to protect you, it's to protect everyone around you."
20405,We lose tens of thousands of people on a good year.
20406,A lot of that is avoidable.
20407,Yikes.
20408,I'm in a Phase 1 trial with the GSK vaccine.
20409,So far I haven't died.
20410,I‚Äôm not wearing a mask or fucking distancing after I get the vaccine.
20411,I've also heard it called MODY (mature onset diabetes of the young).
20412,"Most of the women in my SO's family have been diagnosed with ""weird"" type 1 or ""weird"" type 2 (no insulin resistance but lower/inconsistent production), in their teens or 20s despite being, by all other metrics, extremely healthy."
20413,"Also, my coworker was  recently diagnosed with ""typical"" type 1 at age 22."
20414,&gt; Wait you just admitted there is no reason to go to the store.
20415,Nope.
20416,Sure didn‚Äôt.
20417,Quote me.
20418,&gt; So answer my original question.
20419,Why can't group a go out and group b stays home?
20420,I already did.
20421,&gt; Also what is with the stereotypes you bigot?
20422,What did I stereotype?
20423,Your assumptions don‚Äôt make it true.
20424,"If I said Casey was in a relationship with Andy, and you assume they‚Äôre two gay men, two gay women, or a straight man and a straight woman, or any other arrangement of sexuality and personhood, that makes *you* the bigot."
20425,I just picked the first handful of names that came to my head.
20426,We will just drive fast enough to not be caught by corona!
20427,This is a very crucial part of this trial as it will show if the Vaccine works on kids as some vaccines affect kids and adults differently.
20428,"It shouldn‚Äôt be but 3rd world places like US, Europe, Brazil, Canada, and India have no functional government."
20429,Thanks for taking the time to answer questions today!
20430,What are some ways to stop the spread of misinformation on the upcoming covid vaccines?
20431,I know a lot of people who probably won't take it because they are afraid of it not being safe.
20432,Social distancing isn‚Äôt happening much NOW in my city and we are currently the Covid epicenter in America.
20433,"This isn't for a treatment, but a vaccine, and this isn't phase 1, it's phase 3."
20434,"Americans can always be counted on to do the right thing, after they have tried everything else first."
20435,-winston churchill
20436,"To be fair, Germany did not have the same level of lockdown as most EU states in the spring."
20437,"While certainly, it will disturb daily life significantly, I hope we don't have to go for even tougher restrictions."
20438,"I sympathize with people who don‚Äôt get paid sick leave but where I work, we get sick leave and our managers never discourage anyone from taking it so I don‚Äôt know why my coworkers come in sick anyway (and they often do)."
20439,I have a friend who‚Äôs office gives 6 weeks paid leave combined for both vacation and sick.
20440,The end result was that everyone came in sick because they wanted to take more vacation.
20441,"Any company that doesn‚Äôt give sick leave sucks and that needs to change, but for everyone else, they need to be more conscientious."
20442,I don‚Äôt know why we went from it being acceptable to come into the office half dead to everyone being assumed to be sick even if they feel 100% fine.
20443,There‚Äôs got to be a better middle ground.
20444,I thought it was a bigger story because only a few days ago the state was fighting the teachers union in court to continue  reopening despite high infections.
20445,The state won that fight  a few days ago and now they are closing.
20446,"No problem, glad you didn't misread it as snark, cause I genuinely didn't mean it that way and realized after that it could sound that way."
20447,There are a lot of very difficult decisions to be made and we're all exhausted as it is.
20448,Someone else said almost the exact thing to me that I said to you and it helped me decide when I would be willing to get the vaccine.
20449,Stay healthy and take care of yourself!
20450,It's my way of saying I have no idea.
20451,"I'm an economist, not an epidemiologist."
20452,I know just enough about epi to sound somewhat less stupid.
20453,I think it is relevant.
20454,"The reason why flu vaccine isn't 100% effective in any given season isn't mainly due to antigenic drift; that's just the reason why you have to get one every year, and yes partially because of the guesswork that's necessary due to antigenic drift."
20455,Guesswork that's also necessary when you're dealing with a totally new strain of virus (probably a lot more guesswork).
20456,The reason why it's not totally effective is partially due to the same reason why the COVID vaccine won't be.
20457,It's effectiveness depends on your immune system being healthy and older people and already sick people don't have as effective of an immune response.
20458,"They should definitely be the first to get the vaccine because they're most at risk of mortality, but inconveniently they'll also be the one's for whom it's least effective (compared to healthy young people) in preventing them personally getting COVID."
20459,And that's why so many healthcare pros are saying that the vaccine won't be enough until we get case numbers down to a point that it's not such a threat to aging and sick populations.
20460,Why we'll still need to distance and mask up for a while until that happens.
20461,Is this trial not double-blinded?
20462,How is this known?
20463,Edit.
20464,Thanks to JVorhees and FC37 for the responses  TIL more about how vaccine trials work.
20465,Close.
20466,"You become immune, but only to those specific strains of the flu virus."
20467,"Usually you get protection against 3-4 strains, but there are many types and they mutate easily."
20468,This is why the protection against flu is not even close to the protection offered by most other vaccines.
20469,Though it appears to also reduce severity if you become infected with related strains.
20470,How can you still say this when I have provided several successful examples?
20471,Are you that oblivious to competant infectious disease management?
20472,Oceania has been doing incredibly well.
20473,Mystery cases are what matters most and Australia has minimal.
20474,If you slowly open while managing cases aggressively and having strong border control it has been shown to work (as proven in countries such as NZ and Vietnam.)
20475,"Thailand too, COVID free life as normal."
20476,Damn you really like being wrong.

20479,"Let‚Äôs keep in mind these are parents and other old people (like the guy in the thumbnail), so it would actually have been schools thirty-forty years ago that failed."
20480,Which I think is fairly obvious given the average level intellect we see in the older folks
20481,Is it the 12 to 15 demographic or they are going lower?
20482,it sounds so bad without any context
20483,"Hmm, I think we've seen some examples of people having it just as bad or worse the second time around."
20484,Hopefully those are outliers.
20485,"Ah, puffs of smoke instead of ghosts then."
20486,"Juxtaposed against Matthew 5: 17, what I make of it is an example of yet another of the many contradictions in the Bible."
20487,I do appreciate the words as an expression of optimism and fortitude.
20488,On an aesthetic note: Psalm 91 was beautifully set to music by Bernstein for his Mass.
20489,made ya click
20490,I don't see a false positive rate as a much of a negative.
20491,So what if they grab a false positive?
20492,"Pull that person out of line, give them another test to verify and go from there."
20493,50% accurate would be HUGE when it could apply to anyone very quickly in a public setting.
20494,"If its higher than that like you suggested, that's just icing on the cake, even with some false positives."
20495,"There might be more reliable options, but none that can perform dozens of checks a minute without interrupting the people at all in a public setting."
20496,"Let the dogs grab what they can in mass, even if some are false positives, and use more accurate testing to confirm afterwards."
20497,It isn't a magic bullet.
20498,US cases are so widespread that this will linger and be a threat for quite some time.
20499,"Even if available, some people just aren't going to take the vaccine, and those people will keep circulating it into the population."
20500,You have to deal with that part.
20501,"For other countries that have already beaten this, even they warn a vaccine won't solve the problem."
20502,They still see the need to play an active part in keeping it away.
20503,"Well we may need to run more tests, but I definitely feel this is a bad sign for the placebo medicine to be the cure we've been dreaming of."
20504,"Let's cut it out with ""delay the inevitable"" crap."
20505,"China, South Korea, Australia, New Zealand and a bunch of other countries are successfully containing the virus."
20506,"You are pretending that this epidemic cannot be controlled, but it's an outright lie."
20507,[removed]
20508,... that it came from an unidentified source.
20509,What‚Äôs the likelihood of covid causing skin rashes?
20510,I have read reports and studies online about different rashes but while I was on the phone with contact tracing they told me it is not a symptom.
20511,Does anyone have any insight?
20512,How is the best way to deal with friends and family members that are either covid deniers or conspiracy theorist?
20513,We‚Äôre fucked.
20514,Nice knowing you guys
20515,"Congrats, you are the only r/coronavirus user that has kissed a girl"
20516,as i'm not virologist or specialist in vaccine : does that mean we have to seriously worry about the vaccine's safety?
20517,Does that means the Astra Zeneca vaccine will have to stop definitely?
20518,Let's not forget that pharmaceutical companies were shipping millions of painkillers to this state alone.
20519,"&gt; cells of the virus

A virus does not have a cell."
20520,It said she was already on life support which means she would've had a machine breathing for her.
20521,"If they had taken her off of it after they pronounced her clinically dead, then yeah, 30 minutes without oxygen would likely mean a lot of dead brain cells and no coming back from that."
20522,Are frontline workers healthcare workers?
20523,Or does that include essential workers too like grocery clerks?
20524,Or postal workers?
20525,"As expected, this did not age well."
20526,MOre or less full lockdown comes into affect tomorrow at 6:00
20527,[removed]
20528,Agree completely.
20529,It is a very selfless act.
20530,"I wouldn't do it, wouldn't want to take the risk, so that helps me appreciate them even more."
20531,Their bravery and decency.
20532,"Kid's song in 3030: ""When you cough and laugh it off but you die it's placebo..."""
20533,That‚Äôs a challenge study.
20534,"You can‚Äôt do that with a placebo, they‚Äôre infecting people on purpose."
20535,Even doing one is pretty out there because it kinda violates ‚ÄúFirst do no harm.‚Äù Even if you can say the societal benefits will outweigh the cost to the participants.
20536,Way too tonfoil hat for me.
20537,Lying about a coronavirus vaccine to advance its approval would be the end of the company if it turned out the vaccine harmed billions of people and/or their children.
20538,"The risk is far, far higher than big oil or tobacco."
20539,"It's really sophisticated to be jaded and cynical, but this claim doesn't pass the sniff test."
20540,"On top of the pandemic risk, factory farms are a major contributor to climate change which is another upcoming global crisis."
20541,"Giving up meat is one of the biggest ways you can personally help with climate change, and reduce animal suffering to boot."

20546,"You cant force a large lockdown when the people lives day by day hoping to earn enough to eat, they need to go outside to work, lockdown is not a solution in poor countries."
20547,"People need to work to eat day by day, they dont have any kind of savings, and a lot of them survive with less than 5 dollars per day."
20548,"""God's plan"""
20549,"As someone participating in the Moderna study, we do not know if we have a placebo or vaccine."
20550,My money says that this person got the shot and thought they have a vaccine because they didn‚Äôt pay attention to the researchers explaining how the study works.
20551,"They then probably acted like an idiot, got virus, and delayed getting medical attention until it was too late because they got the vaccine."
20552,"Italy registered 15k cases a dude did the math, I wish he/she didn't, and with the exponential rise of cases we could have 40million cases before Christmas; the whole Italian population is 60million."
20553,The vaccine is 5 months away
20554,Time for another rally I guess /s
20555,I hope no one is laughing...
20556,This is catastrophic.
20557,"The US has trailed behind since the beginning and will probably see a similar rise in the coming months, although I hope they don‚Äôt."
20558,Doesn‚Äôt look promising so far.
20559,Lots of young adults were soldiers in WW1
20560,Second lockdown here we come.
20561,Looking like half-assing ourselves through the cold season is not an option.
20562,Unfortunately our politicians chose open schools as their hill to die on.
20563,"It's just exploded across Europe all of a sudden, I still think Poland and Czechia are the two most terrifying cases because both went from a relatively small total at the start of the month to getting 10k cases a day, with both countries significantly smaller than Italy."
20564,So the easy solution is outdoor weddings with masks and social distancing.
20565,The event industry can add a surcharge for the extra cost.
20566,Don‚Äôt like the extra cost?
20567,Have a smaller wedding.
20568,"That must be where the phrase ""Uncle Sam"" comes from."
20569,"Well, I did see finally (this morning) a breath test may have been developed with results in minutes."

20572,"Yeah, but as someone has pointed out police sniffing dogs are kind of suspect."
20573,"Lots of times, they will 'alert' because their handler gives them a cue - either consciously or subconsciously - and that makes them alert and give a false positive for things pretty frequently."
20574,"Dogs that alert when they aren't being handled, are much more accurate than dogs that are being led by a handler from what I've read."
20575,"This is a news story because there's ad placements to be sold on an article covering ""Death"" and ""Corona Vaccine""."
20576,"Unfortunately, this is sold via an Ad Delivery Network that doesn't care if it's a story that will generate lots of views or ""Backwood Baseball Team carves own bats from wood taken from Backwood"" :/"
20577,"&gt; It's insane anyone would release the article without that info first... Just creates panic and distrust

Also lots of clicks."
20578,Could be wrong but isn't this based on a preexisting vaccine?
20579,I would have though this would be the safer most trustworthy one
20580,Well that's grim.
20581,Wait you just admitted there is no reason to go to the store.
20582,So answer my original question.
20583,Why can't group a go out and group b stays home?
20584,Also what is with the stereotypes you bigot?

20586,"He was 28, you‚Äôd think he would have a good chance of fighting it on his own."
20587,This sub is basically a warzone between hardliners and moderates at this point
20588,RKI always reports the numbers each morning for the day before.
20589,This is the number of confirmed cases today which is updated live while the Health Ministries report their numbers.
20590,RKI will confirm this tomorrow morning.
20591,The super wealthy benefit from this pandemic in a major way.
20592,Apple and oranges comparison.
20593,The annual flu vaccine is based off of what strain of the influenza virus will be most prevalent that year.
20594,"COVID-19 is a single, known strain of the coronavirus."
20595,This person did not die directly from the placebo.
20596,"By receiving the placebo, this person was not protected from COVID-19 and died from complications from that."
20597,This is the expected behaviour.
20598,"It would have been a concern if this person had received the vaccine, as that would mean the vaccine did not protect this person from COVID-19."
20599,"Although not desirable, this is expected to happen in a (hopefully) small number of cases."
20600,"while coronaviruses might repeatedly replicate in the epithelium of the upper respiratory pathway, they will never cause a generalized infection throughout the body again if you developed the T-cell immunity."
20601,"But those without immunity should be scared, because so much talked the herd immunity works differently in the case of coronaviruses"
20602,It was higher then that if I recall.
20603,But it comes with a false positive rate as well and being live animals it's not static.
20604,So while they could be useful.
20605,"There appears to be better, more reliable options."
20606,"&gt; It‚Äôs an excellent comparison

Its terrible to compare something without factoring over a full century of technological advancements."
20607,"Unfortunately, those who insist on infecting other people would be the among the first to get it then."
20608,I have a very hard time accepting that.
20609,It's always nice to read comments from Reddit Scientists with a PHD.
20610,Glad you've taken some time out of your busy schedule finding a vaccine to talk on here mate.
20611,And people kept saying that the US was the laughingstock of the world.
20612,Who‚Äôs laughing now?
20613,Countries that did very serious lockdowns are now being forced to reopen due to economic pressure and still facing the music
20614,The volunteer had the placebo.
20615,But the headline is immortalised forever more
20616,My understanding is it's reliability and turnaround time.
20617,"A less reliable faster turn around that screens for funneling to a more reliable less timely test is, as a combination, an effective system."
20618,Nope.
20619,Grocery stores must scare the shit out of you then.
20620,"Hundreds of people, daily, air flow much worse then 6 minutes."
20621,Damn.
20622,&gt;&gt;youre getting downvoted for providing the whole picture.
20623,"&gt;
&gt;Lol."
20624,"&gt;
&gt;The whole picture would not just focus on deaths, but also those that ""recovered"" but still have health issues from the disease, perhaps including the financial burden that those that ""survive"" now live with."
20625,"Ahhh, you mean muddy the waters until the statistics make no sense."
20626,&gt;The whole picture would include data on what was learned about transmission through contact tracing.
20627,Contract tracing that has been largely absent due to a host of failures in political leadership.
20628,Or we could move on with our lives knowing that between 0.02% and 0.003% will ever suffer significant issues
20629,"&gt;After this winter, I think more will be willing."
20630,"Or more immediately, after EUA is granted,+ most vulnerable and front line vaccinated and hospitalizations start to go down shortly after."
20631,I'm very excited that these conversations are becoming more and more common with every passing day.
20632,We're almost at the start of the end.
20633,Hang in there guys.
20634,[removed]
20635,&gt; Yeah But it hasn't leap from mink to mink.
20636,"I get the feeling you pulled that out of your ass because...

&gt;Mink have tested positive with COVID-19 at more than forty mink farms in the Netherlands."
20637,The mink showed various symptoms including respiratory problems.
20638,It seems the animals got infected by employees.
20639,**Research since has shown that mink have transmitted the virus to each other.
20640,** It is also plausible that employees have been infected by mink.
20641,A mandatory screening of all Dutch mink farms has been instituted and infected mink farms are culled as of 5 June.
20642,"A mandatory closing scheme for Dutch mink farms will be introduced from the spring of 2021.

20643,&gt;I also don‚Äôt know what percentage of COVID cases become ‚Äúlong-haulers.‚Äù From what I gather it‚Äôs fairly small.
20644,"Oxford study from this week said 60% of people in their study (18% hospitalized patients, 82% recovered at home - average age 44) showed organ damage on scans couple months down the road."
20645,85% reported still having some symptoms several months later.
20646,"&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Great!"
20647,"That's the point I'm trying to illustrate, and what everyone is asking you, because you're basically doing exactly that; disregarding what's out there already by trying to apply your personal experience only for some reason

Umm, no I'm not."
20648,My personal experience has nothing to do with this.
20649,I'm talking about the actual numbers.
20650,"&gt;Hence my point above, maybe it's not as bad for you but it's probably worse than what you've personally experienced?"
20651,"I'm not even American, I'm Canadian, and even so with our relatively lower numbers, my parents have had friends (plural) either die, or survive ICU with some serious damage afterwards."
20652,Am I using that personal experience to go around saying the death rate is 20% because of my subjective experience?
20653,"I'm not, and that's why using your personal definition to downplay the severity is just as bad as someone whose had a terrible personal experience exaggerating it in your point of view."
20654,"Again, I'm not attempting to downplay the virus, I'm saying that this specific article is misleading."
20655,"""Highest numbers since August"" *doesn't mean anything, on it's own."
20656,That doesn't mean the virus overall is not bad!
20657,"* 

&gt;And I'm not even accounting for my friends and family currently living in Asia and Europe right now either."
20658,"You're literally telling me that I'm using anecdotes, and then arguing with nothing but anecdotes."
20659,I'm arguing with the actual numbers.
20660,"&gt;As someone else said, why are you giving me a hypothetical, when there are loads of actual numbers out there that are contrary to your experience?"
20661,"Because you all don't seem to understand the point I'm making, so I'm trying to simplify it for you."
20662,I will listen to my Johnny Cash: Live at San Quentin album as a tribute.
20663,"""Serological tests, which look for antibodies to determine if someone ever had the virus, were even starker, showing a 7.1% positive rate among children, compared to a 1.7%-4.8% rate among adults from June 28 to September 14."""
20664,The only line that's available is the one where you learn reading comprehension.
20665,"""Serological tests, which look for antibodies to determine if someone ever had the virus, were even starker, showing a 7.1% positive rate among children, compared to a 1.7%-4.8% rate among adults from June 28 to September 14."""

20667,Ah.
20668,It was my understanding of Danish that failed me.
20669,Thanks mate!
20670,Thank you for the services you are providing during this pandemic.
20671,"I am a retired health care professional, and cannot imagine how difficult your job must be."
20672,I did.
20673,I've edited my comment.

20675,Insulin producing cells don‚Äôt regenerate.
20676,"If they could, we would have cured diabetes already."
20677,That‚Äôs why this is such a big deal in the medical community.
20678,"Which, in turn, makes me wonder how BNO knew this person‚Äôs death was due to COVID-19 in the first place, as I can‚Äôt find any record of the university actually saying this."
20679,It‚Äôs not like BNO don‚Äôt have a record of being laughably sensationalist.
20680,"It may technically work, but it isn‚Äôt reasonable."
20681,"The social isolation has wrecked my life and apparently it isn‚Äôt ending for years, so I‚Äôm already on the verge of giving up entirely."
20682,I am literally only around my spouse and that isn‚Äôt remotely enough.
20683,"Barely functioning due to the depression this is causing, I now need to also wear a mask all day everyday at home?"
20684,Fk that.
20685,I honestly don‚Äôt care if I die.
20686,I hope I do.
20687,Genuinely.
20688,Wtf is there to live for?
20689,Nothing.
20690,"Bring if, covid."
20691,What's the positivity rate?
20692,It doesnt need too?
20693,"If dogs are used to sniff out drugs, I don't see why they can't do the same with the coronavirus."
20694,i dont know why you guys think all of asia just wears masks all the time because they're altruistic and perfect.
20695,maybe we wear one because the air sucks or if you yourself are sick.
20696,but you would never see more than like 1-2/10 people wearing masks in a public place before this
20697,"Yes science, type one isn‚Äôt to do with diet."
20698,That‚Äôs a very simplistic view.
20699,"There are greater costs outside of death, this virus is creating a generation of people with permanent, debilitating disease like diabetes and pulmonary fibrosis."
20700,"Masks are almost certainly going to become a seasonal fixture, at least."
20701,"Too many people are focused on direct mortality and not considering the larger picture of this pandemic, a common misconception among those who lack scientific literacy or medical experience."
20702,"What a competent health authority, making such a bold statement eight months into a pandemic."
20703,Meanwhile in Japan we have been masked since February.
20704,The person got the placebo
20705,What is your home country?
20706,I would suppose it‚Äôs a guessing game what country will have the hardest restrictions in the coming months.
20707,I really don‚Äôt think we will not see hard lockdowns in Sweden.
20708,No curfews.
20709,"Distance learning in universities and bars/restaurants only serving outside - perhaps

A positive thing about Sweden‚Äôs approach has been that the same kind of restrictions since the beginning with only tweaks to it."
20710,"So it will most probably be the same this winter, with tweaks depending on the current state of infections."
20711,"He was supporting Bolsonaro, you know who he is?"
20712,"Also he edited his post, it was saying ""Finally Bolsonaro got it right"" before."
20713,"And yet, the comments surprise you more than a fact that this is CTV news."
20714,"Commentators come in all shape and sizes, but this is a national news outlet who thinks twice before posting."
20715,"It can even happen with extremely minor symptoms too, so people, don't think you're in the clear if you had one day of 100¬∞ fever with no other symptoms."
20716,"My boyfriend had exactly that after being exposed to me just before my symptoms showed, though he didn't get a test, and has only recently started showing some minor fatigue and muscle pains that nothing seems to be helping too much."
20717,"His fatigue and other symptoms are almost exactly like mine but much more bearable, minus tachycardia/chest pains."
20718,"Even worse: the six-foot guideline for schools is *when possible,* so my district has decided that ""within 6 feet"" and ""6 feet of separation"" are functionally the same thing."
20719,"If there was ever any place I could be murdered and stuffed into a barrel of acid, SA would be up there..."
20720,Feels the same in WA at the moment too.
20721,Haven't had a death for 6 months.
20722,No community transmission for 6 months.
20723,"Trains are packed, people wearing masks are looked at like they used to be - weirdo conspiracy nuts."
20724,Why?
20725,Back in April in Western Aus we locked down for 6 weeks while the test and tracers went on a testing blitz.
20726,"I was able to keep working, our economy is booming, Im getting job offers daily with higher pay rates than the last 10 years."
20727,Local tourism is booming more than with internationals.
20728,Just cant travel.
20729,Pretty good outcome during a pandemic
20730,What does this line of thinking even accomplish?
20731,"Regardless of whatever mental gymnastics you want to do in order to get a disingenuous stat that fits your narrative, IF THEY DIDN'T GET COVID THEY WOULDN'T BE DEAD."
20732,"Those people are just religious, they aren‚Äôt actually Christians."

20749,Do you have a source for that information please.
20750,Thanks
20751,"The doubts are already there -- due largely to the federal government 'just putting things out there', favoring their chosen spokesmen in disregard for appointed and Congressionally confirmed disease experts and inspiring distrust in doing so."
20752,"The admin left state leaders no choice but to reassure their citizens that they'd evaluate whatever the federal government goes with, because the admin has shown they don't really take evaluation seriously."
20753,"They just put things out there, as they put it."
20754,Not everyone.
20755,Clearly you haven‚Äôt been to Kentucky and Kansas where they blame every problem on immigrants.
20756,Ok?
20757,People back then saw a *huge* amount of death.
20758,"It would still have been crazy, but not quite as crazy as at would be to us."
20759,[deleted]
20760,So is it bad to complain to the county and my HR about them not enforcing masks?
20761,I feel like asking HR about mask enforcement will backfire if the county ever looks into the complaint here?
20762,Here I thought only the US was selling out their country to the highest bidder.
20763,"About 20x less

EDIT : Actually 446/38 so like 12x less."
20764,"Yes, and the actual numbers support my point."
20765,I was using a simple example because you all were not understanding.
20766,This is obvious.
20767,"And yet, many of the comments here show how some people are determined the miss the obvious."
20768,"Of course, the virus can be spread in a household setting."
20769,Why would anyone think differently?
20770,Because there‚Äôs a vaccine for it
20771,Bloomberg news reporting that it was the placebo.
20772,"Pascal Soriot and co. must have known about this for a while, and yet the trial is set to resume in the US shortly, so that corroborates Bloomberg and hopefully it was indeed the placebo that was given to this volunteer."
20773,"Certainly, it is a highly infectious virus."
20774,The key is to try to do something.

Pablo Linde

Madrid - 21 oct 2020 - 09:09 CEST

After several weeks of apparent stability, the number of coronavirus cases in Spain continues to rise."
20887,"The Health Ministry‚Äôs latest report on the pandemic, which was released on Tuesday evening, showed 13,873 new confirmed cases and added 218 victims to the official death toll, which now stands at 34,210."
20888,"This brings the 14-day cumulative number of coronavirus cases per 100,000 inhabitants to 322.9, a new record for that data point since the health crisis took hold in the country."
20889,"Between the end of March and April, the propagation of the virus was much greater, according to studies."
20890,"But the statistics were lower than they are now: at the outset of the pandemic, only the most serious cases were being recorded, whereas now there are many mild and asymptomatic infections included in the figures."
20891,But this means that these last weeks of October have the worst official data in terms of diagnoses.
20892,"The number of victims, however, is far from the darkest days of the first wave, when more than 900 Covid-19-related deaths were reported in a single day."
20893,"If cases continue to rise, then inevitably the number of victims will too."
20894,"The prelude to such fatalities, pressure on the country‚Äôs health system, has been rising unchecked for weeks now."
20895,"In fact, this data point did not experience the apparent fall in cases seen during the first weeks of October, which now appears to have been a small plateau during a continuous rise."
20896,"According to yesterday‚Äôs report, 11% of Spanish hospital beds were occupied by Covid patients, a percentage that doubles in terms of intensive care unit (ICU) occupation."
20897,But the trend is by no means carved in stone.
20898,"Sources from the Health Ministry admit that the spread of the virus is unpredictable, and that the huge growth of the pandemic across Europe is not exactly prompting optimism."
20899,"Everything will now depend on the success, or otherwise, of the measures that more and more of Spain‚Äôs regions are putting into place in order to curb the spread of the virus."
20900,"The latest ministry report shows rising trends in all of Spain‚Äôs regions, apart from in Madrid, the only area to see a fall in cumulative incidence compared to the day before."
20901,"Even the Canary Islands ‚Äì the only zone in Spain with fewer than 100 cases per 100,000 inhabitants over 14 days ‚Äì has seen a rise."
20902,"On the other end of the scale, the worst-hit region right now, Navarre, exceeds a thousand cases per 100,000 inhabitants, and from tomorrow will be subject to a perimetral confinement among other social measures."

-
20 oct 2020 - 10:05 CEST

Statistics in Spain show 11,000 excess deaths during the second wave of the coronavirus, compared with the same period last year."
20930,"-

Since these are deaths from all causes, the difference between the observed and the expected death count since July, using data from the National Statistics Institute (INE) based on civil registry records, could be partly explained by the summer heat."
20931,"But the Carlos III public health institute, which runs a mortality monitoring system called MoMo, has only categorized 1,959 deaths as caused by heat this year, the same number as last year."
20932,"The 11,000 figure is twice the official coronavirus death toll notified by the Spanish Health Ministry, which has registered 5,400 Covid-19-related deaths since July."
20933,The graph shows the evolution of both figures.
20934,&gt;There are different factors that could explain the difference.
20935,"On the one hand, the ministry only counts victims who tested positive for coronavirus."
20936,"But at this point in time, there should be few people dying without a test, in contrast with the situation in March, when only individuals with clear symptoms were getting checked for the virus."
20937,&gt;It is also possible that the information released by the ministry is incomplete or not up to date.
20938,It is a known fact that the SiViES system used by regional authorities to send data to the Health Ministry shows half as many Covid-19 hospitalizations as the count made by the actual hospitals.
20939,"A similar problem could explain the difference between the 5,400 deaths relayed by SiViES and the 11,000 excess deaths observed by civil registries across Spain compared with the same period last year."
20940,"If the average of the last five years is used, the difference is 10,800 excess deaths."
20941,&gt;A third possibility is that the excess death count includes deaths from other causes.
20942,"This could be individuals whose illnesses went undiagnosed during the crisis months, or who received poorer medical treatment."
20943,"Such cases would not be part of the official Covid-19 death tally, yet could be attributed to the overall health crisis caused by the virus."
20944,"Evolution since March

The graph shows the daily evolution of official coronavirus deaths according to the ministry‚Äôs count, and the excess deaths observed at civil registries compared with last year, based on INE data:

The most salient aspect of the graph is the first wave, which produced 47,000 excess deaths in the spring."
20945,"There, too, it is clear that official figures were lagging behind."
20946,Civil registries counted thousands of deaths in March that were only later added to the official death toll.
20947,"The INE‚Äôs data, published every two weeks since June, show that in May and June the ministry was still adding deaths that had occurred earlier according to registry death records."
20948,The graph shows another peak in early August.
20949,"This probably reflects an unspecified number of coronavirus deaths in combination with a heatwave, which is a typical cause of excess deaths."
20950,"According to the Carlos III Institute, high temperatures may have caused up to 2,000 deaths during the course of two to three weeks around early August."
20951,"That is the same figure as last year, although the 2019 peaks occurred in July."
20952,"Since early August, death records have continued to show more fatalities than in previous years, for a total of 11,000 more than last year."
20953,"Together with excess deaths since March, the total comes out to nearly 59,000."
20954,"The INE figures, therefore, suggest that the real death toll from coronavirus is close to 59,000, although the official death toll is around 33,000."
20955,"Regional differences

The impact of the second wave can also be broken down by regions."
20956,"Arag√≥n, Extremadura, Castilla y Le√≥n, La Rioja, Andalusia, the Balearic Islands, Castilla-La Mancha and Murcia have all recorded excess deaths above 14% since July."
20957,"The graph shows the excess deaths observed by civil registries compared with last year (expressed as absolute numbers, as percentages and per 100,000 inhabitants)."
20958,It also includes the ministry‚Äôs official death toll.
20959,Arag√≥n has been showing the greatest excess deaths since the summer.
20960,"An outbreak there was contained in July, but the fatalities have been accumulating."
20961,"There are also significant excess deaths in other parts of Spain hard hit by the virus, such as Castilla y Le√≥n and La Rioja ‚Äì more so than in regions with a high incidence of the virus such as Madrid or Navarre."
20962,"Andalusia and the Valencia region show excess deaths of 15% and 13% during the summer months, even though their official death counts represent less than a quarter of the total."
20963,"Part of that difference could be explained by the high temperatures, but probably not all."
20964,All these figures were worse in March.
20965,"For every three Madrile√±os who were expected to die in normal circumstances, there were five instead."
20966,"This proportion was three deaths in Castilla-La Mancha for every two expected deaths, and seven deaths in Catalonia for every five expected."
20967,These numbers confirm that the excess deaths recorded during the current crisis cannot be compared with anything else in the last few years.
20968,"Heat was blamed for around 2,000 deaths in 2019 and around 800 in 2018."
20969,"But none of those numbers are comparable to the 58,000 since March of this year."
20970,-
20971,It doesn't fit the narrative of dark forces keeping the truth hidden.
20972,&gt;Workers and their spouses told The Daily Beast that Disney is allowing people who tested positive for the novel coronavirus to return to work despite the dangers and risks it represents.

20974,It unfortunately makes the whole vaccine angle difficult too.
20975,He‚Äôs a career pharma / venture capital guy.
20976,So he definitely isn‚Äôt unbiased or disinterested.
20977,"But he‚Äôs not an idiot, he‚Äôs not a bullshitter, and he doesn‚Äôt want hundreds of thousands of people to needlessly die."
20978,Because they think they're giving it to poor people.
20979,But they're too fucking stupid to realize that poor people already get it.
20980,I work at a group home for people with MR in a poor city.
20981,I also used to buy pills from people at the giant... social security apartments near the hospital (i don't know what the hell else to call them).
20982,Everybody that lived in those buildings never worried a day about their dr appts and care.
20983,Sold their scripts of painkillers when they used to be easy to get.
20984,"Now there's flyers all over the city with ""We buy glucose supplies!"""
20985,"The people with MR... live in a group home, some of them take like 20-30 different meds, some of the most ridiculous shit (they basically take every vitamin in a multivitamin, but all sperately."

20988,From a pharmacy like 45 minutes away).
20989,Poor people already get health care.
20990,Theyre going to keep getting it one way or the other.
20991,"And people that dont want health care for all are basically voting for everyone just above the ""poor people"" line to not receive it."
20992,They vote against themselves recieving free health care thinking theyre denying it to dirty poor people.
20993,When in reality theyre not.
20994,So fucking frustrating.
20995,I hate that you're right

20998,"Here you go: 

Boris Johnson will impose the U.K.‚Äôs tightest coronavirus restrictions on Greater Manchester on Thursday night, after talks with local leaders broke down."
20999,"The prime minister warned that lives would be at risk in the region if the government failed to act, and left open the prospect of a national lockdown if infection rates continued to spiral."
21000,"In a news conference Tuesday, Johnson said the U.K. was on a ‚Äúnarrow path‚Äù and he did not want to impose an England-wide lockdown ‚Äúunless we absolutely have to.‚Äù

Greater Manchester Mayor Andy Burnham warned that ‚Äúpoverty, homelessness and hardship‚Äù would rise because ministers had not agreed to provide 65 million pounds ($84 million) -- the ‚Äúbare minimum‚Äù Burnham said was needed to protect businesses."
21001,"But Health Secretary Matt Hancock said the region would receive 22 million pounds in funding, alongside extra support in line with the packages given to the Liverpool City Region and Lancashire, which are also in the top tier."
21002,"In Parliament he accused Labour of ‚Äúplaying political games.‚Äù

The Labour Party will force a symbolic vote in the House of Commons on Wednesday calling on the government to deliver ‚Äúa fair deal‚Äù for communities facing Tier 3 restrictions."
21003,"Complex Rules

Under the top tier of restrictions, pubs and bars not serving meals have to close, households can‚Äôt mix indoors or in most outdoors settings, and people are strongly advised not to travel in or out of the area."
21004,The new three-tier system was brought in to simplify the complex rules around social distancing across the country.
21005,But the Greater Manchester row highlighted how far Britain‚Äôs response to the pandemic has fractured along political and geographical lines.
21006,Johnson‚Äôs coronavirus strategy has also sparked criticism from his own Conservative MPs.
21007,"Graham Brady, the chair of the influential Tory backbench 1922 committee who represents part of Greater Manchester, warned in Parliament that ‚Äúthe lockdowns themselves cost lives as well as livelihoods.‚Äù

William Wragg, another Tory MP from the region, said: ‚ÄúI cannot but fear that the medicine is worse than the disease.‚Äù

Official figures released Tuesday showed that a further 241 people who tested positive for coronavirus died in hospitals across the U.K., with 21,331 new cases reported."
21008,"That brings the total number of confirmed deaths nationwide to 43,967"

21044,"The US passport is pretty worthless right now, few places will accept them without being quarantined."
21045,"106 deaths today too, which is a lot per capita for a country of 10.7 million people :( they also had a test positivity rate of 29% when I last checked a few days ago."
21046,COVID is utterly exploding in Czechia to a truly staggering degree.
21047,"And since they were barely affected by COVID earlier in the year, almost everyone is still susceptible to it."
21048,shush
21049,"18 fishermen, 5 new imported cases and 2 connected to the port worker (both were already isolated as close contacts)."

21056,"When they said ""flatten the curve,"" I don't think they meant at max hospital capacity."
21057,There's probably going to be a holdout group of r/collapse type crazies who'll still insist that the virus is apocalyptic even after the pandemic has been reigned.
21058,they dont have closed borders.
21059,the mainland brings in a lot of infections.
21060,I'd rather use my mask as toilet paper than use it to protect myself against the flu
21061,And this is why quarantine and heavy regulations should be last resort.

21063,I personally can't wait for this place to be off my Subscriptions and almost entirely inactive.
21064,LOL talk about taking something literally
21065,Fauci expects the vaccine to be 70% effective and the guy in charge of the US vaccine effort expects it to be 80%-90% effective.
21066,"Some more good news: small sample size obviously, but Oxford's vaccine had 100% efficacy after two doses."
21067,Are we really looking at herd immunity for the short term?
21068,Always felt like ending the pandemic would just take vaccinating the vulnerable and health care workers.
21069,We are going to see some crazy documentaries and I am confident that a lot of these strongman leaders are going to be absolutely dragged.
21070,They worship Nurgle.
21071,You can't convince them not to be a plague rat.
21072,"You know how, for some reason, in all futuristic movies it seems like a bunch of people wear masks when in public?"
21073,"Disease-awareness is being injected directly into the populace of the entire world right now, in a way nothing like it before has."
21074,"In the future, peoples are forever going to be more disease-conscious and for that reason alone we'll generally see more mask usage, not to mention there's reason not to keep yourself safe from influenza, and even common colds now that you and everyone else owns a mask."

everyone entering China will have to endure 14 days except those traveling from Macau."

21107,"Hence, it's unlikely we will see the same flu numbers this year."
21108,Deniers will use this as an argument that there is no pandemic.
21109,&gt;  we have gotten to a point we have to get back to some sort or normality we cannot continue to keep all the restrictions in place.

21122,"Well, if politicians aren't held responsible for voting for 20 years of war and associated military budget authorizations, I don't think any politician will be held responsible for Covid deaths."
21123,"Though I think all politicians should be held responsible for deaths they oversee during their tenure, and especially as results from their actions."

21152,I have a lot of thoughts about ny‚Äôs quarantine.
21153,I‚Äôm in nyc and colleagues commute in from Jersey and Connecticut so obviously ny can‚Äôt enact an actual quarantine on those states.
21154,"However, the whole ny quarantine has seemed chaotic with states coming on and off the list so frequently, empty threats about what could happen to those who break it (with no intention to follow through on those punishments), and now neighboring states meeting quarantine criteria but not getting put on the list because they‚Äôre our friend states."
21155,"I‚Äôm all for precautions but this whole system seems more like a way to shame other states, rather than an actual precaution."

21253,Spanish Flu killed that many people between 1918 and 1922 actually.
21254,Three years and multiple waves around the world before the virus mutated further and became less fatal.
21255,It also killed that many people at a time that there was no knowledge of viruses causing illness.
21256,No antibiotics to help prevent deadly secondary Pneumonia.
21257,No antivirals and other medications to prevent runaway immune responses like Cytokine Storm.
21258,We also have no data from then to show how many people actually had the virus vs how many people were hospitalized and killed by it.
21259,"These are all factors that are making Covid look mild by comparison, since the data from then was incomplete and our data today, our ability to test for viruses today, and our ability to treat and stabilize the critically ill today is far more extensive than anything anyone alive in 1918 could have ever dreamed of."
21260,"You are comparing raw numbers from an era that only provides us the number of hospitalized and the amount dead, while ignoring the lack of data from the same era that would show how many people would be mildly ill or completely asymptomatic just doesn't exist."
21261,Youre also ignoring the fact that none of the technologies and medications that keep so many from dying from this virus today just didn't exist back then.
21262,"The question i was giving my 2 cents on at the start of this thread was what if Covid happened then, when we didn't have any of these treatments or methods of testing, when we didn't have ICU beds or ventilators at all."
21263,"Because of all the factors I looked into, id still wager that if you replaced 1918 H1N1 with 2020 Covid 19, it would likely be just as severe of a pandemic, while if you brought back Spanish flu to the world of today, it would likely be less deadly than Covid due to vaccines and the herd immunity that provides, ventilators, and antibiotics being available to mitigate the effects of severe illnesses."
21264,Yeah that's just not true.

21664,"Right now, Europe is a few weeks ahead of the US in terms of the fall COVID wave - just as they were a few weeks ahead in the spring."
21665,This is why the next 6 weeks in the US are supposed to be the worst yet.

21668,"Businesses still require masks, workplaces are temp-checking, yada yada."
21669,If you wanna argue semantics on what I meant by normal that's fine but my point was pretty clear.
21670,People are moving on.
21671,Yeah that‚Äôs not back to normal.
21672,You can say that people are getting used to a ‚ÄúNew Normal‚Äù but things are not back to how they were pre-COVID like you implied.
21673,"&gt;Someone would test positive and they would say ""Yes I actually already had Covid one time back in April""

If they didn't have the test done, it is not documented that they ACTUALLY had it the first time."
21674,So no the doctor's wouldn't take their word for it.
21675,I'm just going to agree to disagree at this point because it's become tiresome debating with you.

21685,I know some people can but it‚Äôs asking a lot of other people.
21686,Plus I see old people out and about mask less every single day so if they don‚Äôt care then what‚Äôs the point anyway?
21687,Nobody wants to live isolated.
21688,Will they be used in the same vein cops use canines to falsely detain people of color?
21689,A few days ago the narrative was completely different.

21800,The flu is contagious.
21801,So is HIV.
21802,So is the common cold.
21803,Person was in the placebo arm.
21804,We work harder to do everything we do safer to keep numbers down.
21805,"Then we have a short planned shutdown to be able to identify as many cases as possible and to test and trace and hope we can crank vaccines and clonal antibodies, and every other trick in the book to throw at it."
21806,I've been saying for a damn long time that we need to take this as a world war.
21807,Humans vs Virus.
21808,The only thing that closing borders does is reduce the number of potential imported cases.
21809,"In a country with a controlled COVID epidemic (few or no cases), closed borders with a mandatory quarantine period for international travelers (in government run facilities) makes a lot of sense because it will prevent re-introduction of the virus."
21810,New Zealand is an excellent example of this; they closed down early and had a very stringent lockdown to bring cases to 0.
21811,The only cases they've had since then have been from imported cases and they've been able to use testing and contact tracing to keep those cases from spreading.
21812,Closing borders doesn't really help a country if they already have uncontrolled community spread as most of the spread is driven by domestic transmission.
21813,"The US is a good example as they closed borders to China early on, which is why COVID is predominantly the European strain."
21814,"However by the time they closed their borders to the EU, there was already an emerging outbreak in New York and other major cities, meaning it was too late for closing borders to have any real effect."
21815,TLDR: context is key.
21816,"It may be going a bit far to say that it's ""driving it"", but it's certainly part of it."
21817,"Keep in mind that contact tracing within households is much easier that it is in many other settings, particularly in western nations in which the ability to obtain data from phone signals, CCTV, etc."
21818,is limited.
21819,"It's pretty easy to contact trace for a homebody who gets infected by someone else in a household who isn't, whereas contact tracing a social butterfly or someone who works with the public in a nation such as the US where the infection runs rampant may be next to impossible."
21820,"In many cases, we really don't know how people were infected."
21821,&gt;The healthcare system was close to collapse only in a limited geographic area and for a short period of time.
21822,The alternative was the healtchare system collapsing in the entire country without a lockdown and travel restrictions.
21823,[removed]
21824,"Wait, should we not all be drinking out of the same cup during a plague?"
21825,"uh, is this the same vaccine that they didn't bother actually testing and waiting for intended effects?"
21826,is this something to trust at all?
21827,"I'm not downvoting you, but go off."
21828,Good .
21829,Will be the end of state run education.
21830,&gt;Students in Boston‚Äôs public schools will shift to remote learning beginning Thursday due to the rising COVID-19 infection rate in the city that was ravaged by the pandemic in the spring.
21831,"I imagine when their kids get covid, it will go something like this:

""Dad, it hurts to breathe."""
21832,"*sounds of ventilator pumping*

""But son, just think about the libs we owned."""
21833,yeah no kidding.
21834,Must have never had a breed that obsesses over smells.
21835,Ours likes another dog in the neighborhood.
21836,If that dog was out for a walk earlier in the day I know because ours seizes up when she finds a scent.
21837,I have to almost pick her up and walk her away in my arms.
21838,"Trained, I'm certain she would be able to pick up on an airborne respiratory pathogen."
21839,"I'm more skeptical about the internal cancers, but this, yeah, I believe it."
21840,"Yeah I think realistically it'll be a second lockdown for a few weeks or a month, then gradual reopening 2.0, then hopefully a vaccine to essential workers and hospitals and elderly before the 3rd wave."
21841,Stay safe man.
21842,"I don't know where you live, but that's really not true in my neck of the woods."
21843,I feel like you may not have any friends?
21844,"People general shake hands, hug, whatever, when greeting friends."
21845,"I've never observed otherwise, it's really not a formal thing."
21846,But Reddit told me only Asia‚Äôs wet markets are bad.
21847,"Whew, people be butthurt in here"
21848,"If it was the vaccine group he was in: big trouble

If it was the placebo, like theyre reporting: validates the urgency for a vaccine given his age and position + trial continues"
21849,I think you‚Äôre seriously misconstruing what‚Äôs being suggested in that article (without reading the preprint paper).
21850,"There‚Äôs nothing ‚Äúdamning‚Äù in that data, merely a suggestion without strong evidence that ACE2 isn‚Äôt expressed in the pancreas the way some thought."
21851,It does nothing to refute the fact that we have observed a decrease in insulin production in numerous patients following infection with COVID-19.
21852,"They‚Äôre arguing that the proposed mechanism is wrong but their argument lacks substantial data (in part because it‚Äôs difficult to obtain infected pancreatic cells, as mentioned in the article)."
21853,This is another problem... there‚Äôs a lot of information being put out about the virus that non-experts are consuming and drawing incorrect conclusions about.
21854,Confirmation bias abounds which makes it difficult to control the public narrative and thus the public response absent serious enforcement.
21855,It‚Äôs depressing.
21856,We‚Äôre all our own worst enemy.
21857,That‚Äôs partially why I‚Äôm confident this is going to last longer than most experts expect.
21858,We tend to underestimate how stupid we are in groups.
21859,Always has been.
21860,"&gt; and then the lockdown went on for too long and was too tough

This can only be gauged in the upcoming weeks, if the PPE is available and hospitals, ICUs and personnel are available it means that at least the lockdown time was used effectively to prepare for the second wave."
21861,No I don't think the Oxford researchers compared it to an other viruses.
21862,"&gt;Long-term health problems seen in low-risk Covid-19 patients Young, healthy adults with Covid-19 who do not require hospitalisation are still at risk for long-term health problems, Oxford University researchers found."
21863,"They studied 201 recovering UK patients with an average age of 44, more than 90% of whom did not have risk factors such as diabetes, high blood pressure, or heart disease."
21864,Only 18% had been sick enough to be hospitalized.
21865,"At an average of 140 days after their days after their symptoms began, 98% were still fatigued, 92% had heart and lung symptoms, 88% had muscle aches, 87% had breathlessness, 83% headaches, and 73% gastrointestinal symptoms."
21866,Organ damage was more common among those who had been hospitalized.
21867,But it was not limited to that group as 66% of the patients had impairment of at least one organ.
21868,"Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans showed mild damage to lungs in 33%, heart in 32%, pancreas in 17%, kidneys in 12%, liver in 10% and spleen... ( https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.10.15.20205054v1)"

21887,"Boston suspended its attempt to resume in-person learning in public schools on Wednesday, citing the city‚Äôs rising tide of cases."
21888,"After starting the school year remotely for all students last month, Boston had on Oct. 1 begun a phased reopening, allowing about 3,000 high-needs students to attend in-person classes at least two days a week."
21889,"The next phase, which would have brought kindergartners and pre-kindergarteners back into school buildings, had been scheduled for as soon as mid-October, but was recently delayed."
21890,"‚ÄúI am heartbroken that today we have to close our doors to our highest-need students,‚Äù the superintendent, Brenda Cassellius, said."
21891,"Those students include some students with disabilities, students who have experienced homelessness and students still learning English."
21892,The city‚Äôs seven-day average positivity rate for coronavirus testing recently increased to 5.7 percent.
21893,The city said that it would welcome back high-needs students when the positivity rate declined to 5 percent or below for two consecutive weeks and would begin the phased return of other students when it declined to 4 percent or below for two consecutive weeks.

Experts said that closing schools might be the right decision given what looks like a surge in cases, but questioned why the city was not closing anything else or putting forward a larger strategy to curtail transmission."
21897,‚ÄúWhy would you ever have restaurants open for indoor dining while you‚Äôre closing schools?
21898,"It‚Äôs wrong on so many levels,‚Äù said Dr. Benjamin P. Linas, an associate professor of medicine and epidemiology at the Boston University."
21899,"‚ÄúThe evidence now is that restaurants drive transmission and schools do not,‚Äù he added."
21900,"He said the decision to close schools seemed like political expediency, since there is pressure to close schools from the teachers‚Äô union, and pressure to keep other activities going, from businesses and members of the public who have pandemic fatigue."
21901,"Brooke Nichols, an infectious disease modeler and assistant professor at Boston University School of Public Health, criticized the city for delaying the opening of schools for most students until late October, given that many epidemiologists had predicted a surge in cases as the weather cooled."

In the past seven days, seven countries ‚Äî Argentina, Brazil, Britain, France, India, Russia and the United States ‚Äî have reported at least 100,000 new cases of the coronavirus, helping to push total cases worldwide to more than 40.7 million, according to a New York Times database."
21904,"In many cases, these countries are seeing numbers that are much higher than they were during the height of the pandemic in the spring."
21905,"At that point most countries locked down, stopping movement and much interpersonal contact."
21906,"Strategies have changed, and today local lockdowns are the way forward for most."

21910,Midwestern and Rocky Mountain states are struggling to control major outbreaks.

21912,"In some states, hospitals are almost full."
21913,"India reported 411,718 over the past seven days, but numbers have been falling since mid-September."
21914,"On Monday, the country recorded fewer than 50,000 cases, the lowest number since July, the government said."
21915,"But the lower numbers, which would seem at first glance to be good news, have raised questions."
21916,"The government recently approved the use of rapid coronavirus testing based on gene-editing technology, hoping to increase its testing capabilities."
21917,But experts question the reliability of rapid tests.
21918,"In France, which has added 174,273 cases in the past seven days, a curfew has been implemented in Paris and eight other regions."
21919,"Still, more than 11,000 virus patients are hospitalized, and 2,000 are in intensive care, a threshold that had not been reached since May."
21920,"(The country currently has 5,800 intensive care beds.)"
21921,"Brazil, which has reported 160,326 cases in the past seven days, is among the countries with the lowest testing rates and still lacks a clear contact tracing policy."
21922,"Despite being the country with the second-highest death toll, about eight million Brazilians had received laboratory tests by mid-October, according to the Ministry of Health, less than a tenth of the number of people tested in the United States."
21923,"But, as in India, the disease has been trending downward in Brazil since early August."
21924,"The country is now reporting an average of 500 deaths a day, half of the daily toll it reported two months ago."
21925,"Most big cities have eased social-distancing measures and opened some schools, restaurants, and beaches."
21926,"The number of daily recorded infections in Britain, which includes England, Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales, has nearly tripled since the beginning of October."
21927,"In the past seven days, Britain has reported 127,622 new cases."
21928,"Hospitalizations and deaths are also rising, and in some parts of the country, intensive care units are being stretched to their limits."
21929,"The countries that make up Britain are each forging their own paths: England has implemented a tiered alert system; Northern Ireland is ramping up restrictions for pubs and restaurants, and closing schools; Scotland implemented a two-week tightening of restrictions; and Wales was preparing to enter a two-week national lockdown."
21930,"Russia has added 103,992 new cases in the past seven days.."
21931,"The government, however, has resisted imposing even local lockdowns, although it has started to enforce mask-wearing requirements The capital, Moscow, is recording about one-third of the country‚Äôs daily new cases."

21935,"The country received praise early in the pandemic for imposing a strict quarantine in mid-March, and although certain restrictions have been relaxed, much of the country is still under some type of lockdown order."
21936,"Still, the virus, which was once concentrated in the Buenos Aires area, has since expanded to much of the country, including remote areas with scarce medical resources."

21949,Edit: zoonose is one of the most teriffing things for me in regards to stoping it and mutating.
21950,Also it s crazy that it s not more in the media.
21951,But same for ADE.
21952,These are really problematic things.
21953,I like being informed.
21954,"It's going to test the topside of the range, if it slices straight through, expect the parabolic curve to worsen."
21955,"That‚Äôs a fair take, can‚Äôt argue with you there"
21956,Temporary victory was the goal all along.
21957,No one thought that 2 weeks can eradicate the virus.
21958,This was to ease the strain on the medical staff and give time for a vaccine or other measures to develop.
21959,"Just wait, all y‚Äôall will catch up soon enough."
21960,"We've had a lot more than that infected, due to testing limitations at the beginning."
21961,March April daily figures are estimated at 100-200k a day in some parts
21962,You would think that this would give more reason to get a vaccine when proven safe and effective .
21963,.
21964,.
21965,It's not bad news thought.
21966,Progress will be gradual through 2022.
21967,"Not drastic until then, just gradual improvements."
21968,Seems like terrible leadership.
21969,There‚Äôs a set of criteria a patient needs to meet before being declared brain dead.
21970,It‚Äôs a challenge tho as cases like this exist.
21971,It‚Äôs hard to know exactly what happened without patient records.
21972,"Because people are in deep denial and do not want to accept this reality, so they get angry."
21973,"It's really very simple, but you have to know a little bit about the basics of pandemics and how vaccines work."
21974,"""third surge""?"
21975,"LOL, we werent done with the first wave let alone a second, or third one to have different surges."
21976,Agreed.
21977,"I've already told a few people close to me to do their big non-perishable shopping now, because give it a couple of weeks and we could be back to lining up and shortages."
21978,"Could take longer, MIGHT not happen at all but I agree that it seems unavoidable."
21979,Also about the fatigue comment.
21980,"The first lock down sent people in my town into a panic (we have only 1000 residents and over a million tourists per year) - now they just kind of shrug and say ""it is what it is""."
21981,There really aren't any winning options here other than a vaccine and we know how long that is likely to take in getting to market.
21982,OC43 was similar in symptoms to the SARS-Cov-2.
21983,"It caused pneumonia and it affected the heart, leading to heart attacks."
21984,"Now it's a mostly harmless ""common cold"", in fact one of the more common ones."
21985,Hoping for a speedy recovery.
21986,The Belgian Health Minister on the other hand may have a harder time if exposed...
21987,There will be any restaurants around by the time a vaccine can be distributed.

22032,"To be precise, former hotspots have 25% antibody prevalence."
22033,Antibody presence may provide protection.
22034,"It is unknown if that protection is quick enough to stop infectiveness, and if it is, for how long."
22035,"Coronavirus, in general, can reinfect although typically the second infection is milder."
22036,On acquired immunity.
22037,I believe that given the massive testing capacity we now have and the presence of likely immunes in key places it would be easier to eradicate C19 today than it was 6 months ago.
22038,The big unknown for me is winter.

22044,Weddings have been a great source of smaller outbreaks.
22045,Do you want to risk killing the vulnerable members of your guests' families?
22046,Where I'm from noone wore masks before.
22047,Not even when we had a flu and visited doctor's or went to buy groceries.
22048,Hope that changes now and we learn to use masks when we're sick.
22049,"But yes, it shouldn't be mandatory."
22050,We should do it out of consideration for others.
22051,Ok what are you arguing?
22052,I said it's not a stretch to think that mask wearing during flu season will become the norm.
22053,"Do I think we'll be wearing masks every day for the rest of our lives, no."
22054,Is it covid causing this or the daily pint if ice cream im eating to try and stay sane?

22080,Thanks...I stand corrected.
22081,"I thought a trial without a placebo was single blind, even with multiple drugs, because even if the researcher was blind, the subject weren't: they would know they'd been given ""a drug"" which could lead to altered behavior or imagined effects."
22082,"Reading back, I see your point and I'm grateful for your patience."
22083,It's going to get worse before it get better.

Cases/Hospitalizations/Deaths will continue to grow until, France reaches an inflection point at which some combination of (government action/population level behavior changes/the interaction of those 2 things) will lower R0 below 1 and then everything will start to decrease."

22090,"This is to ensure that the placebo group also gets the usual unpleasant side effects from being vaccinated - otherwise, it'd be easy for the volunteers to figure out whether they'd got a vaccine or not."

22121,"I am too lazy to look up stats for 2018-2019, but I am sure it is still in the top tier.Poland was one of the first countries to fully close their border in mid-March."
22122,"So, cases were very low here until the election where there was a small uptick."
22123,I would say the main cause of the second wave  is schools and the EU pressured Poland to keep their borders open to other EU countries and to stop quarantining people.
22124,"I am not sure about other areas, but Warsaw does a good job of tracking cases and wearing masks when asked."
22125,"That‚Äôs exactly what I said, and I get downvoted by what can only be hyper introverts who want to justify their shut in lifestyle."
22126,Elimination will depend on whether vaccines have high efficacy and duration.
22127,"This virus has a low survival profile, it cant persist in host or the environment so once you block transmission it disappears quickly."
22128,As little as 50% herd immunity could eliminate this virus during summer.
22129,Then its a mater of preventing it being imported from other countries.
22130,Not so easy.
22131,"Thats the thing majority of Australia is open, Western Australia has had no COVID for 6 months now."
22132,"Only VIC and NSW, they aren't easing until continued periods of no community transmission which is becoming more common."

22135,Any short term prediction?
22136,"&gt; the cellular immunity that our bodies develop after being infected with live virus provide protection for life

The reinfections say otherwise."
22137,One death wouldn't necessarily mean it doesn't work.
22138,Even if the vaccine had 99% success rate (some are higher than this thankfully - Yellow Fever vaccine for example) there is always that unfortunate 1%.

22148,It has been paused for over a month now.
22149,It's not quite that simple.
22150,"For one, a too-large portion of the population lacks internet access or even a computer in the home."
22151,Money.
22152,The government MUST provide financial assistance to those unable to work as well as to businesses which can not operate.
22153,Education.
22154,Remote learning is presently quite terrible for younger students and even more so for children in pre-K - middle school.
22155,It must be improved.
22156,Adherence.
22157,Some people won't do it.
22158,Some people won't do it and will do things that don't really harm anyone.
22159,"Some people don't do it and will do things that DO harm others, and those people must be punished in order to discourage that behavior."
22160,And other things I can't think of.
22161,***HOWEVER.
22162,"*** We can address those things, and we can do it and we should do it."
22163,"In this case, the astrazenca placebo is another different vaccine."
22164,One for meningitis.
22165,Which is clever.
22166,"All vaccines have some side effects (sore arm, fever, etc)."
22167,"With that, everyone in the trial is getting a batch of these side effects and it prevents short term immediate side effects from being how to tell placebo apart."
22168,So then say that instead of throwing around random insults.
22169,"This is the equivalent to the United States recording 238,920 cases and 2,727 deaths in one day."
22170,"Mostly, people transmit it at home, at work or at parties, where masks are not worn."
22171,Masks mostly just prevent coupling of social circles by droplet and fomite and food infection.

22268,Vaccines are not a golden ticket to immunity.
22269,Covid vaccines are expected to provide 40%-60% immunity.

22287,I suspect dogs who were infected spent a long time with their sick owners.
22288,"I know if I were sick I would want to spend all day on my bed cuddling with my dog, especially if I were isolated from other humans."
22289,(Obviously I wouldn't do that knowing what I know now about the possibility of my dog catching coronavirus.)
22290,"In other words, the barrier to infection is higher in dogs and they probably won't catch it after brief contact with an infected person."
22291,Have you seen the false positive rate on drug dogs?
22292,Scientific tests are supposed to include a control group.
22293,Vaccines are almost never effective on 100% of a population.

22297,Well ok than why can't the second group just wear mask and social distance?

22304,"Not insane if you short the stock first, just risky, immoral, and possibly illegal."
22305,These are calculable with SIR disease models.
22306,"You can estimate it by knowing the COVID R0 factor (about 3 depending on location), target vaccine effectiveness (they are hoping for ~70%), and some estimates of what percentage of the population get it."
22307,"If less than 70% of people get a 70% effective vaccine, it is unlikely to be enough (effective ~50% immunity)."
22308,We need ~60% herd immunity for an R0=3 disease.
22309,But it will be extremely helpeful -- a minor amount of mitigation measures should push down the R0 factor so that ~50% effective immunity is sufficient.
22310,"Note that the placebo in a vaccine trial is usually another, already approved vaccine."
22311,"Vaccines aren't inert, they cause inflammation and a few other minor side effects since they are designed to stimulate the immune system."
22312,The easiest way to mimic that is to just give people another vaccine.
22313,I think you missed jajdaks sarcasm.

22318,Pretending it isn't remotely annoying to be masked in your own home makes you look insane even on this sub.
22319,"The health advice doesn't say I have to be happy about it, it says to wear it."
22320,Anybody claiming they're perfectly comfortable isn't arguing in good faith.
22321,You don't have to think they're comfortable to comply with health advice.
22322,You're trying to enforce thought crime.
22323,That's what really annoys me about masks.
22324,"It isn't the fact I have to wear them, it's the fact that society demands I be happy about it."
22325,"Only when they‚Äôre flapping, which is only in emergencies or if all the sky-hooks are taken."
22326,"yeah, and im curious why we haven't heard of a remedy that could help fight the virus for someone who already have symptomes"
22327,And it makes me so hard!
22328,I think people also don't realize the planet has already gone through 5 mass extinction events.
22329,This is just the 6th.
22330,The Permian‚ÄìTriassic extinction killed over 90% of all species living on earth and life on the planet still made a comeback.
22331,It‚Äôs deliberate genocide
22332,Yes I agree going to a bar is equally asinine.

22337,I am optimistic we'll get it under control eventually.
22338,Hopefully we'll learn more about it and how to treat symptoms and prevent complications.
22339,Maybe within the next few years a viable SAFE vaccine will be created.
22340,Until then we have to let it dictate our behavior.
22341,Very true here.

## Abstract

The recent emergence and rapid global spread of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pose an unprecedented medical and socioeconomic crisis, and the disease caused by it, Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), was declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO) on March 11, 2020."
22501,"Chinese scientists and physicians rapidly identified the causative pathogen, which turned out to be a novel betacoronavirus with high sequence similarities to bat and pangolin coronaviruses."
22502,"The scientific community has ignited tremendous efforts to unravel the biological underpinning of SARS-CoV-2, which constitutes the foundation for therapy and vaccine development strategies."
22503,"Here, we summarize the current state of knowledge on the genome, structure, receptor, and origin of SARS-CoV-2."

# To avoid quarantining students, a school district tries moving them around every 15 minutes."
22666,"&gt;To reduce the number of students sent home to quarantine after exposure to the coronavirus, the Billings Public Schools, the largest school district in Montana, came up with an idea that has public health experts shaking their heads: Reshuffling students in the classroom four times an hour."
22667,"&gt;  
&gt;The strategy is based on the definition of a ‚Äúclose contact‚Äù requiring quarantine ‚Äî being within six feet of an infected person for 15 minutes or more."
22668,"If the students are moved around within that time, the thinking goes, no one will have had ‚Äúclose contact‚Äù and be required to stay home if a classmate tests positive."
22669,"&gt;  
&gt;Greg Upham, the superintendent of the 16,500-student school district, said in an interview that contact tracing had become a huge burden for the district, and administrators were looking for a way to ease the burden when they came up with the movement idea."
22670,"It was not intended to ‚Äúgame the system,‚Äù he said, but rather to encourage the staff to be cognizant of the 15-minute window."
22671,"&gt;  
&gt;In an email to administrators last week, Mr. Upham encouraged staff members to ‚Äúwhenever possible, disrupt the 15-minute timeline through movement, distancing, and masking.‚Äù  
&gt;  
&gt;Infectious disease experts say that moving students around every few minutes is actually more likely to increase transmission of the virus, by exposing more people to an infected student."
22672,"It will also complicate contact tracing efforts, they said."
22673,"&gt;  
&gt;‚ÄúThat is not an evidence-based practice or sound scientific policy,‚Äù said Dr. Jennifer Nuzzo, an epidemiologist at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security who has been supportive of [reopening schools](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/01/opinion/coronavirus-schools.html) for in-person instruction."
22674,"&gt;  
&gt;The 15-minute, six-foot definition is a guideline for identifying who might be at greater risk of infection, not a hard-and-fast rule about when it can or cannot happen, Dr. Nuzzo said, adding that a person can certainly become infected in less time or from farther away, especially indoors."
22675,"&gt;  
&gt;Dr. Sarah Fortune, chair of the department of immunology and infectious diseases at Harvard‚Äôs school of public health, said the 15-minute definition was meant to help contact tracers ‚Äúeffectively and efficiently identify people with the highest risk and target intervention to them.‚Äù  
&gt;  
&gt;Kelly Hornby, principal of Billings West High School, wrote in an email to his staff last week that moving students around every few minutes and then returning them to their original desks would help dissipate airborne droplets containing the coronavirus, to the point ‚Äúwhere the risk of being contaminated is greatly reduced.‚Äù  
&gt;  
&gt;Dr. Fortune disagreed with that idea."
22676,"‚ÄúThe particles that transmit Covid, they hang out in the air, and they spread through the air, and the aerosols can hang out for a very long time,‚Äù she said."
22677,‚ÄúSo stirring that air up or moving around from your spot doesn‚Äôt really limit your exposure or risk.‚Äù

22714,"As long as it brings down new infections, hospitalizations and deaths to a level without other interventions that society deems acceptable (just my guess... around the same levels as the flu), the virus does not need to go away for the vaccine to be a success."

22759,I personally believe that there will be a big problem when it comes to the December reopening.
22760,"Let's be honest, it's gonna take probably at least 10 days from now to see any effect at all from level 5."
22761,Then about 2 weeks later they will already meet to discuss on how to reopen on the 1st of December or when.
22762,I don't see the numbers decreasing enough to make any judgement call around mid-November.
22763,We might still see 600 or 800+ daily cases around that time.
22764,So they will add an additional 2 weeks until middle of December.
22765,Now the 1st of December they are going to evaluate again and to no surprise numbers still show like 400+ infected or a number that at least still seems relatively high.
22766,"Now what are they gonna do, open everything up for Christmas?"
22767,Next lockdown will then probably be in January for another 1-2 months.
22768,Or keep everything closed for the rest of the year to hopefully open up in January with low numbers we had in June?
22769,I think we will either have everything shut for the rest of the year or reopen all shops for Christmas season despite still having high cases.
22770, &gt;People that have a tougher bout covid tend to have a stronger immune response.
22771,So people like your Grandpa will have a higher chance to get it again.
22772,"Unless he wears a mask, social distances himself and doesn't touch his face until he washes his hands."
22773,Do you think everyone is getting reported and tested?
22774,According to the CDC In the state of Florida there have been thousands more deaths in Pneumonia cases this year than the median of the previous 5 years.
22775,Not everyone is being tested and not every death is being contributed to Covid.
22776,There are thousands and thousands more deaths than what they're reporting.
22777,That without a doubt includes reinfections.
22778,"When the news was circulating and you had symptoms, they said for you to stay home and only go to the hospital if it gets serious."
22779,Those two friends of mine didn't get tested because they were told to stay home.
22780,Hospitals are now filled up higher since August.
22781,"They recovered from covid but because they had to work to pay bills, they had to put themselves in terrible situations."
22782,Luckily they're relatively young.
22783,I don't think anyone should panic over this virus.
22784,"It's simple to social distance, wear a mask, use hand sanitizer when you can't wash your hands, and don't touch your face until you wash your hands."
22785,"&gt;""So 38 million cases worldwide."
22786,"A couple of dozen cases of reinfection reported so far,"" Dr. Soumya Swaminathan, a chief scientist at the World Health Organization, told CNN earlier this week."
22787,It hasn't even been a year yet.
22788,The last pandemic lasted for 2 years.
22789,"Like they said in the article you linked, the Sars virus immune response after getting it lasted much longer than covids antibodies."
22790,We still don't know very much about covid 19.

22806,New Zealand was able to shut down travel into their country.
22807,NY has ZERO control over the states that border it.
22808,"No matter what, if the states that border NY and the people who fly into NY are not taking the precautions NY takes nothing that you do will stop the spread of the virus."
22809,This is where the ineptitude of the US federal government comes into play.

22811,"Not only that, air travel to the US would need to be halted."
22812,Travel over our land borders would need to be halted.
22813,The federal government failed massively in stopping the spread.
22814,"So in closing if NY took drastic measures the likes of WUHAN, they would have still been in the place they are in now."

22872,I feel terrible for university students now; you're genuinely missing out on a great part of your life.
22873,Hope the vaccines get here soon.
22874,Which is silly cause I think i read people who are familiar are saying vaccines would be available by summer of next year.
22875,"Sure they might finish researching it soon, but to mass produce and ship it out etc, it's going to take time."
22876,Schools are all open where I live in Wisconsin.
22877,We also have exploding case numbers.
22878,It's honestly not as dramatic as it seems.
22879,I think they framed as a harder lockdown than it actually is to cause a shift in perception among people.
22880,"Because if you read the actual rules, there is an endless list of exemptions - not only there is a long list of shops and services that can stay open, but the ""restriction on movement"" allows going to work, to shop, to meet family and to go to a park or to nature."
22881,"Frankly, I have a hard time thinking of something that I would normally do and it would be not allowed now!"
22882,That‚Äôs fine and that‚Äôs expected.
22883,"However, if the older population and/or those at most at risk can start being vaccinated, that eases some of the stress on the world."
22884,"It will decrease the amount of hospitalizations, deaths, and risk for those who are in that age/health group."
22885,"Numbers will go down, since there will be less people prone to catching the virus."

22891,Trump clearly was a super spreader.

22900,That being said this article isn't taking about a correlation.

22902,I think the concern here is that we continue to use total cases as a proxy for better metrics.
22903,"Why even waste the time, just report the case mortality."
22904,The reason people doubt using only cases is because of the herd immunity argument.
22905,"Namely, at the beginning of an outbreak the case mortality would be highest (people most likely to die would die)."
22906,"That would relate to future cases being milder, thus the skepticism over the total # of cases being a useful metric."

### Abstract

Background: Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+) - a coenzyme found in every cell in the human body - is involved in hundreds of critical metabolic processes."
23011,"However, as humans age, intracellular NAD+ levels decrease - this depletion appears to be exacerbated during complicated SARS-COV-2 infections."
23012,NAD+ depletion impairs our antiviral defense systems and our ability to optimally control inflammation.
23013,"Methods: Ten consecutive acutely-ill presumed SARS-CoV-2 infected patients older than 50 years were treated with over-the-counter nicotinamide mononucleotide (NMN), betaine, sodium chloride and zinc sulfate (NMN cocktail)."
23014,"Eight patients had positive nasopharyngeal SARS-CoV-2 NAA test results, one patient was clinically diagnosed with COVID-19 based on classic symptoms and one patient was excluded as COVID-19 was ruled out."
23015,"The COVID-19 patients were monitored with clinical evaluations, body temperatures and room air (RA) oxygen saturation (O2 sat) levels."
23016,Serial inflammatory cytokine measurements and chest X-rays (CXRs) were done in 7/9 of the COVID-19 patients.
23017,"Results: Cases #1, 4, 7 and 10 were critically-ill with worsening O2 sats, pulmonary infiltrates and inflammation prior to administration of the NMN cocktail."
23018,"Post-treatment, prompt clinical improvement was seen including fever resolution in 2-3 days (4/4), rapid CXR improvement (4/4), dramatic drops in CRP (4/4) and IL-6 (3/4) within 72 hours and hospital discharge in ‚â§ 5 days (3/3 cases)."
23019,No patient required ICU care or intubation post treatment.
23020,"Cases 5 and 8 (bilateral pneumonias but no prior CXRs) and cases 2 and 3 (symptomatic outpatients with failed trials of hydroxychloroquine (HCQ), azithromycin (AZ) and zinc (Zn) with no CXRs performed) had a strong temporal relationship between NMN cocktail use and rapid clinical improvement."
23021,Patient #6 improved with prompt fever and symptom resolution but after premature NMN cocktail discontinuation he relapsed.
23022,Summary: The NMN cocktail resulted in rapid and dramatic clinical and laboratory improvement in older persons with complicated SARS-CoV-2 infections.
23023,"NMN with and without boosters deserves further study in elderly patients with complicated COVID-19 as this treatment has a strong molecular rationale for success, can be safely administered orally at home and in critically ill hospitalized patients."
23024,"Restaurants, bars, and night clubs appear to be missing from the list."
23025,Except for schools potentially these are the most prolific spreading hubs.
23026,"Also, if we're looking at a vaccine that is only 50% effective, then if 60% of the population is vaccinated, only 30% should be assumed to have real protection."
23027,"That being said, under competent leadership, I can't see it taking more than a year or so to vaccinate all Americans who are willing to be vaccinated."
23028,Plus primarily older folks who aren‚Äôt doing much distancing
23029,Stay strong Italy.

23277,"The math is not on your side there, even with a better-than-expected vaccine and better-than-expected rollout, we‚Äôre unlikely to get to a level where we benefit from herd immunity come fall of next year."
23278,That means social distancing and mask wearing will continue.
23279,Say a vaccine is 70% effective (that would be fantastic) and 50% of the population manages to get the two shots required (that‚Äôs the best we can do with the flu vaccine in any given year though polls show 66% of Americans won‚Äôt get vaccinated when the first vaccines are released).
23280,"That would only give us 35% protection which isn‚Äôt enough to create a herd immunity effect even if we were able to maintain current levels of masking and social distancing (which let‚Äôs face it, is an unlikely scenario as people suffer Covid fatigue)."
23281,Throw in an extra 1% to include people already infected (assuming a durable and effective immune response contrary to what antibody studies indicate) and we still aren‚Äôt there.
23282,"The sooner we recognize the reality of our situation, the sooner people might start taking our public response more seriously."
23283,Part of the problem is that a lot of people expected this virus to be gone already and that has impacted their behaviors and then made people depressed when it doesn‚Äôt turn out that way.

23290,"One the risk of overwhelming the healthcare system is gone, everyone will rush to reopen as far as possible."
23291,"The ultimate, and arguably only, goal of the vaccine should be to stop deaths spiralling out of control every time unchecked spread of the virus gets out of hand: eradication is a complete pipe dream, but a only few cases here and there really is ""just the flu"", given what we now know about risk profiles, and incredibly simple for society to manage."

23357,"There‚Äôs zero evidence of galactic civilizations, and zero chance we can terraform Mars before Earth turns into a wasteland."
23358,"You‚Äôre detached from the reality of the universe, and the Great Filter which obviously exists."
23359,Isn‚Äôt this only true when talking about isolated incidents?
23360,At the end of the day if you take on a sizable viral load if you have an 80% chance to stay protected it would still be a good idea to wear a mask in public because you could be taking that chance many times a day.
23361,You‚Äôd be more likely to catch COVID in *each instance* than flip a coin three times and get heads each time.
23362,"Well the king came back from holiday for this, so shit is about to go down."
23363,He must be angry with us for sure.
23364,"Coronaviruses, unlike flu viruses, are genetically very stable because they have built-in proofreading mechanism, they are estimated to mutate at a rate of between 10% to 25% that of flu viruses."
23365,"There are hundreds of variants now but no true new strains, scientists call the ""variants"" until there is proven clinical differences (there is one spike mutation that might be considered a different strain at some point)."
23366,"Currently, all antibodies generated by all existing variants work against each other, so scientists are still confident that one vaccine will cover them all."
23367,"Re-infection cases tend to over-represent infections by different variants because if the same variant caused both the first and second infection, there is no way to prove that it is a re-infection and not post viral shedding."
23368,"&gt; The problem is that the flu vaccine isn‚Äôt particularly effective and at least the first round of Covid vaccines are likely to be just as bad

Wrong."
23369,The vaccines currently in Phase 3 trials are estimated to be 75% to 90% effective.
23370,"And it's not binary, even if the vaccine doesn't prevent infection, it'll likely mitigate the worst outcomes of contracting the virus."
23371,&gt; This is so much worse than the public seems to appreciate and it‚Äôs maddening for scientists to watch the public at large continue with risky behavior in light of what we currently understand.
23372,Humans are social creatures.
23373,"We aren't going to stop acting like humans just because some ""scientists"" in a lab coat told us to."
23374,&gt; A two year duration to the pandemic seems less and less likely as things get worse and worse.
23375,And where'd you get this estimate from?
23376,Looks like you just pulled it outta your ass.
23377,Is it a misinterpretation or is it just a loophole around safety regulations that's being abused?
23378,"lmao I can just see this on the official paperwork

NYC - okay

LA - okay

Tibet - major pain in the ass"
23379,DeSantis should be ‚Äúoff the table‚Äù
23380,Well how else would you explain it?
23381,I'm not sure i understand how your multiple concrete vs something lighter examples pertain to this situation.
23382,You kind of just threw them out there with the term relative.
23383,Are you saying that this is relative information for different people?
23384,So you're saying this has to do with economic projection?
23385,Do people use this informtion specifically when investing?
23386,I guess I didn't really think of it that way... seems less informative still than studying trends and what not but I'm not an economist either
23387,"Yes I agree it was impossible without all these things, and the lockdown should have also gone on for longer to bring cases to zero."
23388,"But this is the problem: either you assume that it‚Äôs impossible to eliminate the virus and you want to only limit the damage in dire situations, and then the lockdown went on for too long and was too tough, or you try elimination, but this would have required the opposite and strong travel restrictions after."
23389,It‚Äôs the middle of the road approach without a real plan that it causing problems.
23390,Of course it‚Äôs not just an Italian issue

23401,I would MUCH prefer online schooling.
23402,"Honestly, this whole pandemic has awakened Agoraphobia in me."
23403,"I fucking LOVE chilling at home all day, working, reading, watching movies, playing games and not having to fucking drive for 2 hours dealing with people's shit."
23404,Definitely yes.
23405,The restrictions announced a few days ago are ridicolous.
23406,You can drink only when seating starting 6pm instead of 9pm.
23407,"Schools still opened, ""encouraging"" remote lessons for high school students."
23408,Gyms opened for another week then we will see.
23409,Local events forbidden (the season for local events in small towns goes from april to september).
23410,Exibitions forbidden UNLESS THEY HAVE NATIONAL RELEVANCE.
23411,1000 people allowed in stadiums.
23412,30 people allowed for weddings.
23413,At least some regions are starting enforcing curfews.. that's something.
23414,Others are closing schools.
23415,Let's say the government expects the regions to enforce limitations so that officially you are not under lockdown while probably you should.
23416,There's also large debates around how many people actually die of the flu each year.
23417,It seems like the flu figures used to compare to COVID have been quite inflated.
23418,hospitalizations are rising also.
23419,Thanks man.
23420,You probably got Yesterday numbers.
23421,Now are you a resident of Moscow or St. Petersburg?
23422,I disagree that it's down to political capital.
23423,I think it is lack of proactivity more than anything else.
23424,"Opening schools, a demographic that is least likely to show symptoms, without having adequate surveillance in place to catch cases before they have a chance to spread far and wide, is more likely to be the culprit here."
23425,I can't imagine my coworker got that idea from any other place.
23426,Lol.
23427,It's also not entirely untrue that there are many businesses and business owners that would be ruined by a shutdown.
23428,I'm 100% in agreement about businesses providing PPE.
23429,We do it at our company in construction and have for years.
23430,We had hundreds if not thousands of N95 masks on our shelves before the pandemic ever happened.
23431,"Regarding shutdowns, my company for instance has a monthly payroll of probably 2-3 million dollars between our union tradespeople and management (office) staff."
23432,"In a good year, the high end of that range would be all of the company's margin before any costs of expansion."
23433,The company probably has cash on hand to keep on paying fixed costs (i.e.
23434,"not labor), but the only way the lights could stay on if we were shut down would be to lay everyone off."
23435,It's probably safe to assume it's way lower than that cause I'm sure tons of people got the virus and never got tested
23436,"I don't know how you're defining ""control""."
23437,"Early on the chant was ""flatten the curve"" to avoid hospitals being overrun, that has been largely successful, aside from Italy very early on."
23438,"The medicine is starting to catch up, if the reports of several vaccine candidates being in stage 3 trials are accurate."
23439,I think most reasonable people knew this was going to surge going into fall/winter.
23440,"Everybody needs to continue to take reasonable precautions by social distancing, wearing masks, etc, but understand that this is going to get worse before it gets better."
23441,"&amp;#x200B;

23447,"I don't know what or how that sample might be, but can imagine about twenty different methods."
23448,"Trainers would need to avoid ""positive sample fatigue"" in the dogs."
23449,"If dogs normally find positives as an anomaly (drugs, explosives) the training may need to be different than that used for drugs, explosives, etc."
23450,"Or, say they were sniffing through a hole in the wall, large enough for only a pup snout."
23451,"The same ""negatives"" could volunteer to go past the hole one or two more times."

23459,Lol it‚Äôs actually the inverse but nice try
23460,Politicians don‚Äôt have the room to be ambiguous.
23461,If you read the mandates though (which they know no republicans will) you‚Äôll see what I mean.
23462,"I can‚Äôt speak for California but in Washington the health mandate is actually quite loose in its definitions and even though it‚Äôs interpreted as ‚Äú100% mask‚Äù it never once says that in the health mandate, it simply says when interacting with people or indoors, and even that has caveats."

23494,You literally made a post about it.
23495,I look at people's submission history to avoid the inevitable conversation with a teenager.
23496,I started travel nursing during the pandemic.
23497,I am filling the spots of nurses that were laid off during the initial wave.
23498,Now the hospital is hiring travelers and paying out the ass to get enough ICU nurses to care for these people.
23499,It's nuts.

23501,"Per CDC, death rate in the 70s age group is ~ 10%."

23508,"For example: If I use it alone, using mask, sanitizing all that touches buttons or surfaces, taking off shoes after, etc, how much of a danger is the virus that's in the air, left by other people who took the elevator before me?"
23509,Are there any articles or studies about this particular issue?
23510,Thanks a lot.
23511,Keep trying what?
23512,I'm trying to find a study that supports wearing a cloth mask based on evidence.
23513,Let me know if you find one.
23514,"While I do agree, we also have to acknowledge that the people themselves share the blame."
23515,For instance.
23516,just because a bar or restaurant happens to be open doesn't mean that it is a good idea to go there during a pandemic...
23517,we‚Äôre quarantining inside since february due to family being very healthy but very vulnerable to any lung issues...
23518,I really wish darwin would work faster.
23519,much faster.
23520,no space in this world for narcissistic assholes who literally protest because of simple masks only inside stores and public transport which itself again led now to more restrictions which they will also protest.
23521,"I do hope they all get it, so they change their dumb dumb minds... and based on the speed of spread it won‚Äôt take long..."
23522,Being able to deny any condition that they can connect to a previous covid 19 infection.
23523,So basically any condition that appears after a covid 19 infection will just be a listed as caused by that previous infection.
23524,"Autoimmune conditions 
Heart and circulatory conditions 
Respiratory conditions

23526,Hey I guess my uneducated fears are wrong.
23527,I am wrong.
23528,I just wanted to see what people smarter than me would have to say about what was going on inside my head.
23529,I am glad you guys called me out.
23530,I will probably  continue to be made fun of but at least I know not to be afraid of what I was afraid of.
23531,I am wrong.
23532,It's gonna be like this forever until we get the vaccine and then it will probably continue after that due to so many saying they won't take it.
23533,Right!
23534,And lord forbid we have a natural disaster or mass accident event....on top of the flu.
23535,Pandemics are inconvenient so we like to pretend they aren't there.

23540,Ok buddy.

23542,I took a walk in the city center over a month ago in Uppsala.
23543,It was pouring rain and quiet chilly (between 5-10C maybe) yet the seats outside had plenty of people dining.
23544,I definitely think those gas warmers + roof makes a difference.
23545,There are many who refuse to dine at a restaurant or cafe if there are no outdoors seatings.
23546,Question is if it makes a difference to dine outdoors too during the winter when it's cold and the humidity is very low (studies show that the virus spreads more easily in low-humidity).
23547,Are you bubble boy
23548,It sucks that the ones doing the right thing are suffering the most (other than the people who get Covid and lose their jobs of course)
23549,oh shoot that reminds me i need to
23550,Truth!
23551,"Man, that sounds really hard."
23552,Ive often thought about what the rough sleepers were meant to do.
23553,"I know its been hard, and I know the lockdown affected different people in different ways."
23554,I more want to sit back and be happy with the results that we've achieved.
23555,"Whether you agree with the cost of lockdown or not, youve gotta be amazed at what we've done."

23561,You can‚Äôt be serious.
23562,this is one hell of a headline
23563,A lot of people on this sub were advocating that the herd immunity threshold was 20% and some places like Arizona and NYC had already hit it.
23564,Didn't seem to take into account changes in human behavior.
23565,Surprisingly many non-essential businesses are allowed to stay open.
23566,Does humidity factor into the spread of the virus?
23567,I have to agree with OP here.
23568,Constant 100% distancing imposes nearly draconian measures.
23569,It‚Äôs really about being smart with the circumstances at hand and each individual.
23570,"If they are interacting with high risk people, then sure."
23571,"If they‚Äôre around the same people every day and no one is high risk, then the overall risk goes down and those restrictions can go down or away."
23572,Lol in my job everything is back to normal like the pandemic never even existed
23573,Alright.
23574,You didn‚Äôt (and you don‚Äôt have too) answered my other questions.
23575,I just read about the Spanish flu and how to second wave was way more deadly then the first one.
23576,So who knows what terrible stuff is laying ahead of us.
23577,Apparently the first wave of the Spanish flu was not much more then a seasonal flu but the second one could kill a young healthy person within 24 hours of infection.
23578,Not fun.
23579,people's*
23580,Think of more relevant analogies if you want to try that shit lol how embarrassing
23581,"""Jumped by"" means added cases."
23582,"Earlier number + 8,500 new cases."
23583,"""Jumped to"" means what the number of cases is now."
23584,"""Jumped to"" is a better choice of words."
23585,Ugh.
23586,It's so true.

23592,right.
23593,they can't legally force anyone to wear a mask until they put the country in state of emergency and they SHOULD DO IT.
23594,but people don't seem to understand it's for the best.
23595,"It's like they think until a governmant forces you to wear a mask, masks won't work."
23596,virus doesn't give a fuck if it's mandatory to wear a mask or not.
23597,"and anyone with half  brain should wear a mask not because he has to, but because he knows he should."

23616,"I'm not overly familiar with immunology, but I've gotten the impression that antibodies peak after a few weeks and gradually dwindle."
23617,"So getting a negative antibody result, depending on timing, is not necessarily surprising."
23618,The caveat is that your body has other immune cells (I believe memory t-cells?)
23619,that can *produce* those antibodies at a later date if the virus shows up again.
23620,"I don't think that grants immunity the way we think of it, but I think it is a system that makes reinfection less likely to be as significant as the initial infection."

23659,"TL;DR:

&gt;Freedman looked at all Emirates flights from Dubai to Hong Kong between June 16 and July 5."
23660,What he found is quite telling.
23661,"During those three weeks, Emirates had five flights with seven or more infected passengers on each flight, for a total of 58 coronavirus-positive passengers flying on eight-hour trips."
23662,"And yet, nobody else on the planes ‚Äî none of the other 1,500 to 2,000 passengers ‚Äî picked up the virus, Freedman and his colleague [report](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7543400/) in the *Journal of Travel Medicine."
23663,"*  
&gt;  
&gt;""Those were flights with higher risk, and yet there was no transmission,"" Freedman says."
23664,"&gt;  
&gt;On another Emirates flight, a whopping 27 coronavirus-positive people boarded the plane in Dubai."
23665,Guess how many other passengers were infected on the eight-hour flight?
23666,"&gt;  
&gt;""There appear to have been two in-flight transmissions,"" Freedman says."
23667,I take a ton of armodafinil.
23668,It isnt something so easy to regulate.
23669,That is a great hidden perk about masks.
23670,No more fake smiles!
23671,!
23672,I follow (until yesterday) a Disney group that has a lot of members.
23673,"After the news broke that Disneyland won‚Äôt be able to reopen until cases dramatically drop, the page host posted a pretty inappropriate rant about how the she didn‚Äôt understand this ‚Äúagenda‚Äù and some other pretty nasty things considering she lives in FL, who dgaf."
23674,"However, lots of people were commenting and saying things like CA is still completely locked down and you can‚Äôt really leave your house, and how Newsom is a tyrant, etc."
23675,How are things really?
23676,Everyone dies eventually.
23677,Just probably not because of this virus.
23678,"Yeah, I was just thinking about colds and how for most of the winter I‚Äôm dealing with them, or getting over them."
23679,"Slight silver lining, I guess, if the cold infection rate presumably plummets this year."
23680,They update the official statistics on Tuesday-Friday  but only have press conferences/briefings on Tuesday/Thursdays :)
23681,Yep.
23682,That‚Äôs what we‚Äôre trying to do.
23683,"Avoid possible exposures, and limit any actual exposure when it‚Äôs not possible to avoid it."
23684,"Elimination is not the goal, just keep the R0 low enough to save more lives."
23685,"Reinfection has been demonstrated in multiple cases, but was believed to be rare."
23686,Reports examining more widespread reinfection strike me as alarming.
23687,Would you say the investigation of larger scale cases of post-infection immunity only lasting a few months does NOT deserve headline-level attention and discussion?
23688,"Here's the latest case/death charts for Colorado, with running 7-day averages:

[https://www.statmap.org/?LOCALE=Colorado#data](https://www.statmap.org/?LOCALE=Colorado#data)

The case spike doesn't look good."
23689,"Although overall Colorado is still ahead of the game, at 38.72 deaths per 100k population."
23690,"That ranks them 32nd in per capita deaths:

[https://www.statmap.org/rankedstates.html](https://www.statmap.org/rankedstates.html)"
23691,The death toll is literally like 2.8% and people are just using fear mongering as a tactic to hide what's happening politically.
23692,"I can't believe I JUST realized, this year, that the nasty cold I probably spread around my office every year, may be contained if I just wear a freaking mask...."
23693,"I will continue to wear a mask at every little *tingle* even if it is only to protect those around me, and I will always wear one on public transportation, in hospitals, etc from now on."
23694,"It's such an easy infection control solution, not for everything of course but for somethings!"
23695,They're already giving hints and preparing the public.
23696,"They lied, again."
23697,"When you give away your freedom, you're not getting it back without a fight."
23698,Hence why the white old man in suits call it 'the new normal'.
23699,"Not seeing your friends, living inside of a computer screen, its all supposed to be 'normal' now."
23700,Well over my dead body.
23701,A vaccine should atleast prevent infections by 50/70%.
23702,"And if you do get it, you'll get much less sick then without a vaccine."
23703,"But that's not enough, nobody can die because government cares so much about other people's health(still yet to ban any sort of fatty foods, alcohol, cigarattes etc, thousands die of cancer, heart disease etc) but no, deaths dont matter, if its a COVID death though..."
23704,i had a bum cough at me for yelling him in a store for not wearing a mask.
23705,keep in mind a judge ruled they can‚Äôt refuse service to non mask wearing customers...
23706,[removed]
23707,"There have been tons of articles mentioning the antibodies not lasting long, but failing to mention things like memory T cells."
23708,"Hell, just look at the title."
23709,It‚Äôs click-bait.
23710,Just like the 100 or so articles saying the same thing since April.
23711,"well, if you sit down and reread my sentence i too didn't simply state 'they are falling like flies'."
23712,there was quite some text after it and it was tightly connected to the rest of the comment and the message i tried to leave.
23713,"so, since you were commenting on parts of the message instead of the whole context, i figured i'm only expected to answer the same way."
23714,"But I'm pretty sure getting bored of it and ""not letting it dominate your life"" will make it go away."
23715,That will probably change in next 1-2 weeks.
23716,You can't keep up 10+k cases a day with 30-50 deaths a day too long.
23717,"All of the indoor areas will still require masks, even after vaccine distribution."
23718,"Concerts will also be held, but at a reduced capacity with audiences wearing masks."
23719,"Our leaders are taking the ""he's only doing it to get a rise out of you, if you ignore him he'll stop"" approach"
23720,Do all three.
23721,"Mask, SD, no crowds."
23722,"Yeah, Halloween is definitely that big over here."
23723,Such a drama queen.
23724,No but you can put up to three causes or consequences of death on a death certificate in Illinois and if they had it it would be on there
23725,Tough choice.
23726,"I don't know anyone who likes the way distance learning is unfolding for FCPS but then again, we  aren't talking about having a particularly low positivity rate either."
23727,"i was seriously concidering getting a pepper spray can and using it on anyone who doesn't wear a mask correctly, but i don't have balls to actually do it."

23732,Masks are just as important as the other two.
23733,"Wear a mask, social distance, and stay out of crowds of unmasked people."
23734,The three together.
23735,"Uh huh, and you know this how?"
23736,Covid testing and screening (especially long term effects) is still in it's infancy.
23737,"And we already have enough actual, scientific evidence to suggest that even if Covid doesn't make you immediately sick, it can fuck you up in other ways in long term situations."
23738,"Again, Cardiovascular damage, prolongued lung tissue damage, brain fog, neurological disorders have all been linked as post-covid phenomena."
23739,"Also, your uncle is a sample size of one."
23740,"Scientists are using 'slightly' bigger sample sizes in the multi-millions, sourced internationally."
23741,"So your anecdotal (and statistically lucky) example of your uncle not getting fucked by Covid means little, logically speaking."
23742,You're confusing your immediate surroundings for the reality of the world at large.
23743,And the reason I don't call Donald Trump a fighter is the same reason I don't call Kanye West a Genius.
23744,"Mental illness can be immensely destructive, but that's not to be equated with being a 'fighter'."

23755,This was my stance back in February/March.
23756,"We got a house last year, and I had always wanted a fully stocked pantry."
23757,So I took the upcoming pandemic as an opportunity to stock that shit out.
23758,"Spent around $300 just on canned goods, non-perishables, etc."
23759,"Has been a huge help this summer, and having just a huge stock of random foods is just really nice to have around."
23760,"I was also able to keep treats for the kids around, between boxed goods, canned fruit, etc."
23761,It‚Äôs not fear mongering.
23762,Antibodies are your first line of defense against reinfection.
23763,"Having memory cells will probably help you recover faster if you get infected, but they don‚Äôt react quickly enough to stop you from getting infected entirely."
23764,Cases have been creeping up over the last two weeks from an already worrisome baseline.
23765,"But yeah, ""soaring"" seems like a bit of hyperbole."
23766,"If you want soaring, look at Colorado (and others)."
23767,"Still, when your talking about exponential growth, sustained increases are a very bad sign, and TX now falls in that category."
23768,I thought mutations across different strains have yet to materially change the part of the virus targeted by the current vaccines.
23769,I don't think we should be very concerned until there's evidence that a known mutation in circulation would impact effectiveness.
23770,lol what do you mean waste?
23771,If shit is the same next year you wont have an option.
23772,Gee we could keep the level low right now...
23773,Many conspiracy theories end with the goal of lowering the world population.
23774,The virus does generally hurt healthy people.
23775,It just takes 10 years off those already marching towards the grave.
23776,"In the long run it could be financially beneficial to take so many out of Medicare, social security, and healthcare."
23777,"I‚Äôm not saying I believe, but there are some benefiting"
23778,"Yep, I did the same thing when I first heard a few stories about this."
23779,If I had to guess I would say it's not bs but it is pretty rare and when it happens people share the story with everyone they know.
23780,Doing over 1M tests per day is guaranteed to result in some mistakes.
23781,Here in America everything is open too you just get to have corona when you do those activities
23782,Thats good.
23783,I love smoking
23784,That's a conservative estimate.
23785,"When this is all through, 100+ million is a possibility, and the awful thing is that the vast majority of that is entirely preventable‚Äî a function of our economic system rather than the virus."
23786,"To start, the excess death count (above 300K) suggests that our count of deaths attributed to COVID‚Äì19 is only about 70‚Äì75% of the true number."
23787,"Furthermore, also not counted‚Äî because we don't have enough information, since the disease has existed for less than a year‚Äî is the loss of life expectancy induced by health problems acquired by survivors."
23788,"For example, someone who's 25 and gets very sick (e.g., on a ventilator) might have a 2x relative risk of all-cause mortality for the rest of his life‚Äî which is equivalent to about a 9-year loss of life expectancy."
23789,"Finally, and most needless, there's the economic damage, and the associated mental health burden."
23790,"The 0.01% has insisted on keeping around a brutal, outdated economic system in which people who can't work don't eat."
23791,"People are going hungry, and people are getting evicted, and both of those experiences do long term damage."
23792,"Children in families that face eviction have an alarmingly high rate of schizophrenia later in life, and an SZ diagnosis is about a 15-year hit to life expectancy in first-world countries and 25‚Äì30 year hit in the US (because of a nonexistent safety net, and because employers can pretty much do whatever they want discrimination-wise)."
23793,A 5-year-old kid whose family is being evicted today is at significantly higher risk of MH problems his entire life‚Äî which means we'll be suffering after-effects of this thing for most of the century.
23794,"You're also going to see post-ARDS sequelae (mental and physical) as well as random post-viral fatigue that, if untreated, can turn into anxiety and depression."
23795,"Some of this is going to go unmarked because it'll pop up in people who had mild symptoms, people who won't even know they had COVID until they have a panic attack at work and get fired for it."
23796,"Even mental illnesses considered mild in comparison to, say, schizophrenia and bipolar I, are going to cost 10‚Äì15+ years in life expectancy in the U.S. because, again, workers have no rights and discrimination in employment is a real thing."
23797,"The economic and mental-health fallout are going to comprise the bulk of the lost life-years, in my opinion."
23798,There have always been highly contagious viruses around us
23799,1 Billion people in the Western society all Lockdown for 2 weeks.
23800,That's 2 billion weeks worth of life lost == ~ 40.000.000 years of life lost.
23801,"Enlighten me, which number is bigger?"
23802,More or less.
23803,But for sure someone will tell you it's tourism or bars or restaurants.
23804,Schools are magically immune.
23805,First flatten the curve...then wait for a vaccine...then wait after the vaccine...
23806,These people are enough to turn anyone into an anti-masker
23807,Are you gonna cry
23808,"Salons, spas, barbers, tattoo shops, yoga studios, gyms etc... lots of places are not on that list that would have pretty up-close interactions, which seems wise!"
23809,"To see how health issues affect Covid mortality, look at [https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/izt2jw/factors\_associated\_with\_covid19related\_death/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/izt2jw/factors_associated_with_covid19related_death/), high blood pressure increase risk by about 9%, BMI 30-35 increase risk by about 23%, etc."
23810,Should invite him to audit a class teaching Darwinism.
23811,"I think the sad reality is, and I think most experts just don't want to say it, is that its going to be next to impossible to ever eradicate COVID."
23812,It's more likely going to go endemic and we just treat it like the yearly flu instead of a full-on pandemic.
23813,EDIT: and this kinda goes to the messaging issue that I think was pretty prevalent in the U.S. especially around the first lockdown.
23814,"Back then there was too much messaging that the lockdown was to strangle COVID out and that we would be back to normal, instead of the lockdowns getting it under control."
23815,"Right now, I think there is a serious messaging issue again where certain experts are saying that the goal of vaccines is to eliminate COVID where the reality is that it's really fucking hard to do that, and what we are really hoping to do is to drive it into being endemic."
23816,"At some point, I think leaders need to start being honest that this is really the reality we are facing so people prepare to live with the fact that we are going to even with a vaccine at some point have to just learn to live with it"
23817,Opinions change.
23818,Fauci probably basing his opinions on people actually following guidelines and common sense.
23819,https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/jf9xub/masks_social_distancing_likely_into_2022_fauci/
23820,14.27 is for the single cases.
23821,8.5 is for the total tests.
23822,So the proper value is 14.27 because the other swabs are follow up swabs on existing cases.
23823,"If you make a comparison based on worldometer or other sources usually you always get the total, so in that case your reference is 8.5."
23824,There are several biomarkers that indicate it is not naturally occurring.
23825,The behavior of WIV staff and the CCP following the outbreak is also highly suspicious.
23826,"Contrary to media narrative, no evidence of a lab origin has been debunked."
23827,Ideally you need to distribute the very ill patients before they need the ICU.
23828,That way you could utilise the available beds better.
23829,"At the moment I think there are around 12.5 ICU beds per 100,000, but that might be an outdated figure given that they added capacity in the spring."
23830,Good for you
23831,Because those roaming contagious fart clouds don't understand science.
23832,And that journalist does culture and travel so she‚Äôs been badly affected by this.
23833,Probably also an influencer of some sort on some cesspool of social media.
23834,"Her whole flawed shallow basis of living is shut down in this and like you said, doesnt think of others."
23835,the deranged ones are the ones going about their business as if everything is normal and there isn't a highly contagious virus around us.
23836,Correct.
23837,Thanks.
23838,Editing for clarity.
23839,?
23840,This reminds me RBJ's dissent on civil right case years back.
23841,"Paraphrasing here:

Just because your umbrella protected you from the rain, doesn't mean you have been dry because there is no rain."
23842,I buy this.
23843,"There were some articles coming out about how kids, specifically students were actually really good about mask wearing habits."
23844,Actually better than their parents lol.
23845,The pictures at the beginning of the school year with kids shoved together without masks doesnt  speak for the whole country.
23846,"I think the current surge isn‚Äôt really related to schools opening, but colder weather coming in, among outdoor socialization move indoors."
23847,I've been saying some variant of this and keep getting downvoted.
23848,"Its not going to be one extreme or another immediately, its going to be a slow and varied transition, especially dependent on region and population factors."
23849,Ain't gonna see no cat doing that!
23850,Good doggo :)
23851,I think you mean that the ICU hospitalizations have lag to the confirmed cases increase.
23852,The reports themselves do not have lag on this website as far as I know.
23853,Thoughts and prayers lol.
23854,My family just tested positive.
23855,"We always wear masks, wash often, social distance."
23856,Wash groceries and mail before bringing it into the house.
23857,I can't think of anyone I know (personally) that does more than we do.
23858,"What disappointed me most was when I found out that after 7 months, the doctor just sends you home and says ....""good luck, if it gets worse, go to the hospital, tell them your COVID-19 positive and wait in the car""."
23859,All the BS I hear on the TV about therapeutics... and all they say is good luck.
23860,(Unless you're the president of course)
23861,"Not totally zero, but close to it."
23862,"There typically is not enough virus in ""leftover air"" to be an infectious dose."
23863,"The vast majority of cases happened when two people are talking/breathing near each other, and even then, it takes about 10 minutes for the risk of infection to become significant."
23864,"In super-spreader case studies, people who only spent a few minutes in the presence of the highly infectious person did not get infected."
23865,We have that here too.
23866,The option you mentioned is the best.
23867,We have an outbreak in the schools here... it can all be traced to high school socializing
23868,"new most annoying phrase on this sub:

""tHiRd wAVe cOmINg?!"
23869,"LoL wE nEvEr gOT oUT oF tHe fiRSt oNE!!!1!"""
23870,It‚Äôs not a very tall memorial
23871,Might be?
23872,"Out of the top 25 highest numbers of cases per day, 1 occurred in May, 17 occurred in June, and 7 occurred in October."
23873,October 16 saw the 13th highest number of cases reported in a single day.
23874,"The last week has seen some of the highest single-day totals, and you're saying a second wave ""might be"" happening?"
23875,"There is no ""might"" about it."
23876,"The numbers clearly show the ""second wave"" began in early September."
23877,[removed]
23878,"I‚Äôm not saying we need to lockdown again, but people need to continue to use preventative measures if we are to remain open."
23879,"The point I‚Äôm trying to make is that if a handful of cases is worthy of taking action, then a multitude of cases means that those actions are are even more important."
23880,This aged well.

23882,Come on over to /r/Collapse
23883,This is similar to my district's response to a scientific study.
23884,Study said that every math class taken after algebra 2 (junior level course) would increase educational outcomes in college.
23885,So they moved the algebra 2 course to sophomore level and placed the geometry course at junior level.
23886,"""technically"" taking more math classes after algebra 2..."
23887,"Analysis and scientific reasoning are important, and the programs who prepare our administration do not actually teach it."
23888,"Sadly, yeah..."
23889,I work with public and I see it every day.
23890,"But then, even when the lockdown was issued, there were lots of folks in denial due to how quick their life had to change."
23891,It's the same old problem of people not accepting changes easily... even when provided with valid reasons.
23892,It.
23893,Is.
23894,Not.
23895,About.
23896,Dying.
23897,From.
23898,COVID.
23899,You don't have to *die* or be on the brink of death to require hospitalization and consume hospital resources.
23900,"And believe it or not, you don't even have to have covid to be hospitalized."
23901,"If you overrun the hospitals people *will die* for various reasons, covid or otherwise."
23902,"For example, a recent RV accident in my area resulted in *15* people being placed in the ICU at a local hospital, which severely limited its ability to take care of critical covid cases."
23903,"People are so fucking obsessed about ""not dying"" from covid that they don't realize there are so many other factors that affect hospital capacity, which runs at about 80-85% under normal operations."
23904,I talk to more and more people in the hospital on a daily and its breaking my heart.
23905,I am listing numbers for wednesday.
23906,Where do you get your ‚Äûactual numbers‚Äú from.
23907,Every source I see lists numbers way below!
23908,Just link the source with 15199.
23909,"Today at my contact tracing meeting, our team lead discussed that some people are becoming reinfected in our county."
23910,I asked if there might be multiple strains of the virus.
23911,She said it's possible that it's mutating.
23912,I asked if the CDC has put out guidelines on this yet and she said it will likely soon as it gathers more data from what we're observing.
23913,I feel demoralized that it's going to be hard to have an effective vaccine and how the world's economies can deal with this in if it's going to keep changing.
23914,I hope we can get medical treatments soon as well as the vaccine.
23915,More noise from Mount Stupid.
23916,I keep forgetting how young most everyone else is.
23917,I should probably keep my references to things from this century so people don't think I'm just an ignoranamous.
23918,"Not quite as usual, but yes , schools are open."
23919,but we are lower than..the world
23920,What morons like her don't get is that the IFR will rise hard when the health care system is overwhelmed AND we will have lots of collateral damages because people with other diseases and illness can't be treated right anymore.
23921,"A LOT people will die if we let this virus burn through and even then the pandemic won't stop, the reinfections point in that direction."
23922,Right.
23923,"I was thinking if only we had a good federal response to this, he could've easily won a 2nd term."
23924,Whether that would've ultimately been a good thing long-term is up for debate.
23925,Handling a crisis well doesn't always absolve one of other misdeeds done prior.
23926,He probably would've had as his only thing going into the election 'See?
23927,We stopped COVID-19!
23928,This alone is a reason to vote for us.'
23929,It's 2020 but somehow feels like 1320
23930,To put things in perspective the peak for the first wave was 4000+ in ICU of those 1300+ in lombardy only.
23931,This time the spread is diffuse so the total number of ICU beds available will be more.
23932,Of course the situation is alarming because there is a sharp increase.
23933,In addition not all areas have the same ICU beds per 100k so expecially in some southern regions the capacity might be reached very very quickly even if the global number would be well below 4000.
23934,The problem being transferring ICU patients is no joke so the ability to redistribute these patients to other areas (that also happened during lockdown) is limited.
23935,"on a related note, we should really be normalising online delivery."
23936,"Not just because of the pandemic, but because it's cheaper, more environmentally friendly, better for traffic, etc."
23937,"Obviously for now with the tech illiterate we can't get rid of them as is, but as nice as walking the aisles is, eventually it'd be to phase them out entirely and reopen a lot of wasted land (would still need some to store the food and loading facilities ofc)"
23938,"So, apparently the HFR dropped 3-fold over the course of the pandemic in the U.S.  Good news!"
23939,"https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2020/10/20/925441975/studies-point-to-big-drop-in-covid-19-death-rate

Doesn't this mean that the lockdowns worked in delaying infections and saving people who would have died if they'd gotten sick earlier in the pandemic?"
23940,"But in Sweden, the government actually did shit."
23941,They're very good at tracking and testing.
23942,Or so I've heard in a podcast.
23943,We're shit at it.
23944,Probably the worst in Europe.
23945,We have no other option at this point.
23946,How about..if they don‚Äôt want to teach in person...they can quit?
23947,This is written from the perspective of a person who only believes that which is right in front of their nose.
23948,"They don't understand exponential growth, they don't understand the impact of lasting symptoms, and they don't understand the importance of slowing the virus so it does not become endemic."
23949,"Ignorance, not enlightenment, drives their opinions."
23950,It really depends on how widespread the disease is.
23951,"With respect to this virus, if you get 35% of the population protected (as in my optimistic example above) that really doesn‚Äôt make a material difference on level of infections because the virus is still easily transmitted to far beyond what our hospital system has a capacity to handle."
23952,The virus only goes away when we stop spreading it enough that outbreaks can betrayed and isolated.
23953,"We‚Äôre way beyond that right now, we couldn‚Äôt even get there during the lull of summer."
23954,Maybe next summer.
23955,I'm starting to agree.
23956,There is no coronavirus but the rest of the fauna is trying to kill you...
23957,Let's say police had a hard time back then.
23958,"Generally, you were allowed to exercise out in the open and to walk your dog, but you had to demonstrate what you were there for."
23959,"If they caught you far from your home with your dog, they assumed you were trying to be the smartest guy and so they'd have fined you."
23960,"There were also cross-regional restrictions, so basically every region was treated as a ""state"" of its own and you couldn't cross borders unless it was for work."
23961,"What I was mainly referring to was the fact that even here many businesses were allowed to stay open, even if people argued they weren't as ""essential"" as others (you can imagine the subsequent debate on whether something was essential or not... really hard to decide tbh)"
23962,The cost of locking down is yet unknown.
23963,You already see unemployment rising.
23964,Lmao bro you post this to something like it every other day.

23969,*
23970,He's been getting people killed
23971,It's not currently possible to just make a virus from scratch.
23972,Edit an existing virus?
23973,Sure.
23974,"But that would be pretty obvious, and has been widely tested and debunked."
23975,"There's absolutely no evidence that it was even released from WIV let alone modified there, and abundant evidence that it evolved naturally."
23976,"I thought the number is up to 18,maybe I misheard"
23977,No link to the study in the article?
23978,I call bullshit.
23979,"Study after study on ""X sniffing dogs"" over the course of decades has proven that pop culture belief that dogs are some sort of magic smelling creatures who can reliably give accurate results is completely false."
23980,"When looking at things like drug sniffing dogs they constantly give false positives, almost as if the training necessary for them to smell something will involve rewarding them for getting positives and they'll respond to handler cues and things like that to receive positive feedback."
23981,"&gt; not a very densely populated state

That's the key."
23982,"OR and WA are basically rural states run by democratic representatives, which is ironic that the cons here whine so much as they cash their OR trust checks in the bank or enjoy their lack of WA income tax."
23983,CA is very heavily populated and has several massive metropolitan areas.
23984,"It has almost 4x the population of OR/WA combined, in only twice the land area of the two combined."
23985,Same this is exactly what I‚Äôve seen.
23986,I was hoping there was some more info on what the deal is or why this could be happening.
23987,Or if it‚Äôs all Bs
23988,"Because if testing in March/April had been as developed as it is today (from June) the ‚Äúwave‚Äù we are seeing now would just look like a small ripple, not a wave."
23989,I‚Äôm not playing down the seriousness of the current trend here.
23990,"If this trend continues and ICU cases and deaths become similar to April numbers, it‚Äôs a second wave."
23991,"But right now, the hight of the curve is no way near the April numbers."
23992,"Even if it ICU cases have a 1-2 week time lag compared to confirmed cases, the ICU data can be trusted from the start of the pandemic: 

https://www.icuregswe.org/en/data--results/covid-19-in-swedish-intensive-care/"
23993,"Listen: the op said ""By tomorrow (Monday) there will be 15k cases."
23994,"And I said No, that's unlikely and It will be:

Monday: 10500 / Actual Number:  9335

Tuesday 11500 / Actual Number : 10874

Wednesday 14-15k / Actual Number: 15199

Yes I overestimate a bit on Monday and Tuesday but underestimate as well on Wednesday."
23995,But I think I got the weekly trend right.
23996,My source are all the newspaper and TV news since I live there.
23997,"Shit, this is more than the cumulative number so far in South Korea."
23998,"Yet, people at my work still show up without a mask on, and claim it‚Äôs for medical reasons."
23999,There is a reason Wisconsin is going bonkers with the virus.
24000,Its funny how you can say I'm seriously asking and people will generally still think you aren't rofl.
24001,Thanks for the info.
24002,Have a wonderful day.
24003,I'd imagine that they would use the poor Uighurs in those concentration camps for some of these COVID tests.
24004,What has the colour maroon ever done to you?
24005,"‚ÄúDissenters‚Äù, as in the people who are ignoring science and who have gotten tens of thousands of additional Americans killed unnecessarily?"
24006,"Yeah, I 100% support murder charges against people who have measurably and objectively gotten thousands killed."
24007,"I can't tell if this is just an example of ""telephone"" or if this is actually happening more than it should."
24008,"I have been told by several people I know well and trust that their ""friend/cousin/co-worker/etc"" received a positive test after leaving because the wait was too long."
24009,"Suspiciously, I have yet to hear a firsthand account."
24010,There are a few local news stories in my city about this happening so it seems to be a thing but I would assume it is still pretty rare.
24011,There are over 13 million people employed in the restaurant industry in the United States with restaurant sales nearly $900 billion.
24012,"You have to be joking, right?"
24013,"Recreational entertainment like bars, restaurants, and venues are a huge portion of our economy."
24014,Air is refreshed every 6 minutes on a plane.
24015,That's what the stage three testing is all about.
24016,Someone with a bunch of medical degrees is going to decide if a binary 80% is better than a 75% that also improves outcome for 15% more or whatever
24017,1/5 is good enough odds for me!
24018,"Holy shit, my parents keep making mistakes like this, especially my Dad who's in his 70's."
24019,"I hear a salesman downstairs because my dad had inquired into getting solar panels recently, the moment I heard him instantly I'm thinking ""I bet if I go downstairs Dad will have forgotten to have worn a mask or if the other guy isn't wearing one he'll forget to tell him to wear one."""
24020,"Well, I go downstairs and BOTH OF THEM aren't wearing masks and they're both just talking away happy as can be."
24021,"FFS man, I instantly asked him to put on a mask (which he says he forgot in the car) and I borderline scolded my dad for forgetting."
24022,"Then a few days ago my Dad rented a bounce house for my little brothers birthday and I hear my Dad talking to them outside, same thought popped in my head, I look out the window and there's my Dad just talking and laughing it up with the 3 helpers setting it up, all without masks."
24023,"It's so frustrating because he's so forgetful, but this needs to be engrained on his mind that it's SO FUCKING EASY SO GET."
24024,"Personally, I enjoy the ""we see no increases in cases with schools reopened""."
24025,"You have three cohorts for a school with 500 kids, most of which didn't opt to return in person."
24026,And they go to school for half a day MT ThF and then have two weeks off.
24027,Then repeat.
24028,"I am SHOCKED school ""reopening"" hasn't caused any spikes."
24029,Eyeroll
24030,Assume a vaccine is 70% effective and we manage to get it out to 50% of Americans (the highest coverage we can expect for a flu vaccine every year despite polls showing 60% of Americans won‚Äôt immediately get the vaccine when its available).
24031,That leaves only 35% of the population protected + 1% of people naturally infected.
24032,That‚Äôs not enough to get us to herd immunity even if social distancing and mask wearing remains steady which is unlikely.
24033,This virus is going to be with us through summer of next year at least.
24034,Amazon just extended WFH to June 2021.
24035,Corporate action is more telling than opinion pieces in publications.
24036,"They don‚Äôt make those decisions based on emotional speculation, they‚Äôre modeling the infection with respect to the business."
24037,You need to snort cocaine off her butt
24038,"it is literally written in op, today 177k"
24039,Go work on a hospital ward overnight.
24040,Let's see if you make it until morning.
24041,With 177k swabs vs 26k.
24042,Tell that to the 220 thousand dead Americans
24043,It‚Äôs a great deal of use to the people running the hospital..
24044,That's not how vaccine's work.
24045,It might only last a few months.
24046,If enough people don't take it at the same within the efficacy window then this isn't going away anytime soon.
24047,"They could be asymptomatic when they test positive, wait the two weeks in quarantine, and experience symptoms several weeks or months down the line"
24048,Guts is one word for it
24049,"Well, reading those twitter comments sure was a mistake"
24050,"it all helps, having low vit d &amp; zinc does not help"
24051,"If you think the one doesn't entail the other, despite multiple instances of evidence the entire world over, you're just being dense, a punctilious fool."
24052,"Of course there will be lockdown, just look at the ""new"" concept of ""Circuit Breakers"", which is just the new label they're going to give random and continued lockdowns now"
24053,This is irresponsibly reductive.
24054,Probably over half the population still acts like the virus is a democratic plot that's no worse than the sniffles.
24055,"Every store you go into has signs saying you must wear a mask to enter, half the people inside aren't in masks."
24056,"One large event a state away obviously didn't help, but acting like that's where the surge is coming from is uninformed."
24057,Things are only going to get worse now that there is snow on the ground and it's cold out.
24058,"Hopefully people start taking it seriously once it hits us hard, but it will likely be too late by then."
24059,"From a clinical testing logic perspective, this man is right."
24060,Testing.
24061,"The UK is doing around 10 times more daily tests now compared to the peak in April (300k vs 30k)
I believe this is the case in every country that's experiencing new daily records right now."
24062,There were probably millions of undiagnosed cases during the first wave.
24063,Sensationalist headline anyone?
24064,Are we all scared yet?
24065,"Mate, the problem isn't getting out, it's getting back."
24066,"As long as you're leaving for 3-months or more, you can apply for an exemption and head off."
24067,"But you've got to do the hard yards and 14-days in a hotel when you get back (and it's luck of the draw), and flights back are seriously expensive."
24068,"No, you're describing challenged trials."
24069,Where they give the vaccine and then deliberately infect the patient.
24070,But its never used at all really.
24071,Although there's been an increase support for challenge trials because of what's happening at the moment.

24079,"Yes I‚Äôm sure it‚Äôs very likely people drove to major cities from ND to attend these demonstrations, waaaay more likely than all the locals who met up with people from all over the country in nearby Sturgis and Deadwood, people who worked bars and retail for three weeks then went back home to ND."
24080,"I mean, regional transmission?"
24081,That‚Äôs crazy talk!
24082,No one cares about the science... it's about freedom.
24083,Silly stuff...
24084,You do realise I am not American?
24085,I was all for the first lockdown but you're massively underselling the economic pain it caused.
24086,A second lockdown is simply not viable.
24087,People will kill themselves or act out in unpredictable ways because even the ones with comfy jobs and careers will be sick and tired of another lockdown mentally.
24088,Holy absolute shit that's insane.
24089,  I guess that makes sense since they'd be tracking them much more closely than non-trial participants...
24090,&gt; Pussying around will only make the lockdown needed longer and deeper.
24091,"thats wrong, it always takes the same amount of time for the virus to ""vanish"" per person."
24092,"It doesnt really matter if 100K people have it, or 1 Million, if everyone stays at home."
24093,"It would take slightly longer with 1 Million due to some spreading when people are allowed to buy food, but thats it."
24094,"locking down too early will cause more damage, since they need to do it again in 2021."
24095,"Here is my prediction: Lockdown over christmas/new year, when there are plenty of holidays anyway, no school, stores are closed, so that the damage is kept ""in check""."
24096,"25th, 26th of December are Holidays anyway, 27th is a Sunday, everything is closed."
24097,"Then there is 28th - 30th, with half of 31st, January 1st is Holiday again."
24098,No school for that entire timeframe etc.
24099,"If there is another full lockdown, they will try to put it there."
24100,I don‚Äôt know why anyone thought indoor restaurants could be done safely in the first place :/
24101,Ding ding ding ding.
24102,They are having a second wave because that is simple virology.
24103,"Without eradicating the virus off the face of the earth, this was going to be inevitable."
24104,Except this is science so if one vaccinated participant died they would all start dropping like flies.
24105,Please take off the tinfoil hat.
24106,You‚Äôre feeding into the very disinformation you‚Äôre worried about.
24107,"question, how do you ""stop"" a trial after you've administered the vaccine?"
24108,"I get maybe not injecting anyone new but if you've already got the shot, isn't that kind of it?"
24109,"It's not a lockdown, there won't be one like before."
24110,"The government doesn't know, probably no one does , how to find the balance and limit the flare ups without causing irreparable damage to either economy or covid"
24111,It has not collapsed completely yet but there are some cases of ambulances driving between 4 hospitals as the first 3 refused to take the patient due to lack of available hospital beds.
24112,That being said I would not be surprised if we have a Bergamo situation in 1-2 weeks.
24113,It hasn't reached the severity of March/April.
24114,Look at the deaths graph to confirm.
24115,Economics-wise that makes no sense.
24116,You need to find the sweet spot of these two extremes.
24117,"You highly compensate unemployment -&gt; unemployed have money in the short term -&gt; but they save the money (because we are in a pandemic and recession) -&gt; economy dives further b/c no money is flowing into the economy

OR

High funding for companies with contractually obligations -&gt; invests it back into business -&gt; creates more jobs -&gt; unemployed people receive those jobs -&gt; greater net income overall for people who are struggling in the long term"
24118,"I cannot answer too well since I am working from home still, but here in Austin I see plenty of people without masks outside, but inside stores pretty much everyone seems to be wearing one."
24119,The other day I went to the doctor for just an annual checkup and a lady in the waiting room didn't have a mask on.
24120,The nurse who called me in noticed it and couldn't believe it.
24121,"However, at least I asked her if there are a lot of people like that, and she said no never... so that's good I guess."
24122,"But also keep in mind Austin is likely pretty different than some other parts of the state, especially as you get further away from major cities."
24123,The king came back and Rutte jumped on the grenade saying it was his fault the royal family decided to go on vacation during a pandemic.
24124,"Nah, as long as their ICUs have spots, it's absolutely fine."
24125,"Flatten the curve to help the hospitals, remember?"
24126,The headline says that it‚Äôs at a particular hospital.
24127,I‚Äôm not sure what point you‚Äôre trying to make.
24128,I‚Äôve already encountered people today saying that essentially :(
24129,Vaccines don't provide immunity immediately so getting infected before immunity occurs could result in a death.
24130,It would not mean a vaccine problem necessarily.
24131,This is why people continue to believe the get the flu from the flu vaccine.
24132,I'm in BC.
24133,We're thankfully doing okay but that can slip so easily if we're not careful.
24134,Tremors can come form diabetes if your sugar gets low.
24135,And there is some evidence that covid-19 can bring on diabetes.
24136,I would recommend eating something sugary when you get these tremors.
24137,If they're from diabetes then the sugar will settle them or eliminate them.
24138,"Don't go crazy on the sugar, but be mindful of how much you're consuming."
24139,"Juice, soda, sweets, icecream are all good sources of sugar."
24140,A vaccine that is not yet fully tested?
24141,It is a possibility.
24142,No shit.
24143,They have the highest cases per capita in a country that is among the highest in the world.
24144,With a little bit of maths skill we need to say it is that bad.
24145,Look at the freaking map.
24146,Half the country is already about 50/100k/wk.
24147,Pussying around will only make the lockdown needed longer and deeper.
24148,Sorry but at least in this sub (the only place I‚Äôve seen it discussed) it has been roundly criticized as unethical from the first mention of it months ago.
24149,"Because when it‚Äôs Americans it‚Äôs ‚Äúfuck Americans, they‚Äôre stupid‚Äù and when it‚Äôs Europeans it‚Äôs ‚Äúon my those poor Europeans‚Äù"
24150,"Can't wait to watch...

""I strongly recommended masks but 1 in 5 people in Albert Heijn wear them."
24151,"Seriously people, I cannot say this more directly without legally requiring it, please kindly wear a mask if it isn't too much of a bother."""
24152,No.
24153,It's bullshit.
24154,Wear a fucking mask and stay away from other people as much as possible.
24155,THERE IS NO MAGIC PILL
24156,It partly cultural.
24157,Latins have a social and close knit culture when it comes to social interaction.
24158,Hence the highee numbers in Italy and France.
24159,"Also, people are ignoring the restrictions."
24160,"Up to a point South East Asians have some of, or share some of the same cultural values as well."
24161,"So, among other factors this contributes."
24162,They talk about the time after it's released and while people will still wait to get a shot.
24163,Unfortunately the news are misleading or intentionally misleading to cause distress.
24164,I'm not giving up cheese for anyone.
24165,That's awesome that you are a landchad.
24166,"I recommend you check out /r/LoveForLandlords

I'm with you on bailing out shit companies."
24167,That was nonsense.
24168,"But companies that are closed due to Government overreach policies can't participate in ""survival of the fittest."""
24169,We should have given them money instead of where we allocated it.
24170,"As I said in other comments, I know people at various levels of state and federal governments and campaigns."
24171,"I just don't see further lockdowns happening, at least in my state."
24172,"That's exactly why shutdown is horrid for the economy, q3 in US sees cases peaking all over the country and expect to see 31-35% gdp recovery vs nationwide shut down in q2, it's not more due to crazy states like california still don't realize their mistake and continue to shut down."
24173,"That's also quarter GDP and full year gdp US is expected to decrease roughly the same as many european countries, that's without taking into account many european countries going into second shut down yet while US will not shut down in Q4 for sure, biggest risk is joe hiden forcing people to hide at home for no reason if he win the election, which will cause huge issues for the economy."
24174,"Also Americans not buying BMW is a great thing, why would Americans buying German cars a good thing?"
24175,"I mean, I imagine they're still expecting the volunteers to wear masks and follow standard COVID procedures."
24176,If this person decided to disregard the doctors telling him to go about his normal business as if the virus could still harm him and he decided to act like he was a god amongst men then he's really really stupid.
24177,That kind of brings up the other issue that's gonna happen when the vaccine is found and people are inoculated.
24178,I absolutely guarantee you there's gonna be a massive surge(possibly the biggest?)
24179,of cases due to idiots not knowing how vaccines work and start going to crowded locations like pubs and nightclubs as if they can't get it anymore.

24217,It really depends on your neighborhood.
24218,"If you've got a big, walkable neighborhood where the houses are close together and most of the houses do Trick or Treat, it becomes a destination and you get a *lot* more kids."
24219,Some of those neighborhoods take it up another notch and organize a block party / street festival.
24220,"So some places in the US get close to the movie stuff, but it's not typical."
24221,Nope.
24222,It's because we don't have nearly as many infections as we did in the first wave.
24223,It's estimated that between 100k and 200k were being infected every 24 hours in the last few days before the lockdown in March.
24224,"The antibody studies generally came out with figures suggesting about 4-5 million were infected over the course of the first wave, and we now suspect that the real number might have been even higher because some people lose antibodies quite quickly."
24225,"The 30% GDP in the US is wrong, they count it differently than the rest of the world."
24226,"And PRCs 5,2%... yeah..."
24227,"I doubt that, given that they didnt move stuff for weeks out of their ports."
24228,China isn't back to normal.
24229,What do you think will happen if their vaccine isn't 100% effective.
24230,Even if it is 75% effective they have problems with such a huge population.
24231,What is gonna happen when they open their borders?
24232,Are they gonna lockdown forever?
24233,"Also, an Italian journalist is in China now in the hospital with Covid."
24234,He passed the two-week quarantine and then contracted the virus within China.
24235,Either it was a late incubation or there is still community spread there.
24236,answered what?
24237,There's practically nothing new in there...
24238,"If you're sick stay home, wear your mask, etc."
24239,I think you have a severe bias that is really clouding your view on mundane things.

24246,"&gt;Hundreds of Victoria hotel quarantine guests must be screened for HIV over blood testing contamination fears  
&gt;  
&gt;**Authorities reveal blood glucose test devices were incorrectly used on 243 people, necessitating screenings for blood-borne diseases**  
&gt;  
&gt;More than 200 people who went through hotel quarantine in Victoria must be screened for HIV amid fears of cross-contamination from incorrect usage of blood glucose test devices."
24247,"&gt;  
&gt;Several such devices were used on multiple people in quarantine between 29 March and 20 August, necessitating screenings for blood-borne diseases such as hepatitis B and C and HIV."
24248,"&gt;  
&gt;These monitors, which take a small sample of blood from a fingertip, are intended for repeated use by only one person."
24249,"While the needle is changed between usages, microscopic traces of blood can remain within the body of the machine, creating a low clinical risk of cross-contamination and infection."
24250,"&gt;  
&gt;Safer Care Victoria, the state‚Äôs healthcare quality and safety agency, has assured the public there is no risk of Covid-19 spread as the disease is not transmitted by blood."
24251,"&gt;  
&gt;These devices have since been taken out of circulation."
24252,"&gt;  
&gt;In a statement, a spokesman for the agency said they have identified 243 people who had been tested by one of the shared machines during the timeframe in question, and will be contacted for screening."
24253,Everyone ‚Äúwho had conditions or episodes that may have required the test will also be contacted as a precaution‚Äù.
24254,"&gt;  
&gt;The Victorian premier, Daniel Andrews, labelled the incident a ‚Äúclinical error that was made some time ago‚Äù."
24255,"&gt;  
&gt;‚ÄúSafer Care Victoria have made some announcements in relation to a clinical error that was made some time ago, very low risk, but you can‚Äôt take any risks with these things."
24256,"You have to follow them up properly and that‚Äôs exactly what has happened,‚Äù he said at a press conference on Tuesday."
24257,"&gt;  
&gt;The health minister, Martin Foley, noted there was currently no evidence of anyone being infected, but the breach was identified and flagged by nurses at the Alfred hospital in August."
24258,"&gt;  
&gt;He said Safer Care Victoria and the Department of Human and Health Services then went through 28,000 medical records to find all those potentially at risk, a process which took several weeks."
24259,"&gt;  
&gt;‚ÄúI need to stress that this is, according to all the clinical advice, a very, very low risk of cross-contamination but, out of an abundance of caution, Safer Care Victoria and the Alfred are doing precisely the right thing,‚Äù he said."
24260,"&gt;  
&gt;He said 141 people had already been contacted and 71 have been tested so far."
24261,"&gt;  
&gt;Victoria‚Äôs hotel quarantine system has been plagued by infection control issues, with an independent inquiry hearing that upwards of 90% of the state‚Äôs second wave of Covid-19 cases stemmed from an outbreak in the hotels."
24262,"&gt;  
&gt;Two senior government figures have already resigned over the system‚Äôs handling, former health minister Jenny Mikakos and the secretary of the Department of Premier and Cabinet, Chris Eccles."
24263,"&gt;  
&gt;The Safer Care Victoria chief executive, Ann Maree Keenan, said there would be a ‚Äúfull review into how and why this device came to be in use‚Äù."
24264,"&gt;  
&gt;‚ÄúThe health of past quarantine residents is our immediate concern, so arranging screening for them is our absolute priority."
24265,The clinical risk is low.
24266,"But if you are at all worried you had this test ‚Äì and we have not contacted you yet ‚Äì please call us,‚Äù she said."
24267,"&gt;  
&gt;‚ÄúRight now, we won‚Äôt be able to answer the many questions people will have about how this happened ‚Ä¶ I hope that we will be able to bring peace of mind through getting people in for testing and through the findings of our review.‚Äù

&gt;  
&gt;Blood glucose tests are most commonly used by people with diabetes, but those with this medical condition are more likely to have been using their own personal device."
24268,"&gt;  
&gt;Instead, Safer Care is concerned that the shared devices may have been used on pregnant women, people who fainted or people who were are generally unwell during their stay in hotel quarantine."
24269,"&gt;  
&gt;Everyone one who went through hotel quarantine who had a blood glucose test, or had any medical episode that may have required a test, is being asked to call 1800 356 061 to arrange a time for a screening."

24271,"Not trying to be pedantic but I think you mean ""Antibody-dependent enhancement""... yeah."
24272,It's a crazy thing.
24273,Note that it doesn't happen too often but people DO get sick just coincidentally during vaccine trials.
24274,That's why it's a random-ass cutoff based on hard science.
24275,You get infected if you get enough virus particles in your mucus membranes.
24276,"Virus particles decrease with distance from the sick person, and your intake is essentially going to be constant over time in an interaction."
24277,So if you are 6 feet away you'll have less (half?
24278,a quarter?)
24279,the particles versus 3 feet.
24280,And if you have 3 minutes interaction you'll have 20% the particles versus 15 minutes.
24281,But neither guarantees you won't get enough particles.
24282,I'll be honest though.
24283,It feels like you're just trolling me.
24284,The science says your chance of infection decreases with distance and increases with time.
24285,The cutoff of 6 feet and 15 minutes is completely random and probably based on what we find convenient.
24286,Unfortunately for him
24287,"That's exactly the point of these trials, to see if you can die from this vaccine or not."
24288,Not only do we not want it.
24289,It wouldn't even work.
24290,As soon as we open up the virus would be back.
24291,Italy: we learned from it.
24292,Let's lovkdown.
24293,"Belgium: lets open eldery homes q
And allow cuddling again to combat loneliness."
24294,Even if the old person has covid.
24295,Prison studies are meaningless for how disease spread for general population.
24296,"Here one a while back :

*""As of May 22, 92 percent of prisoners tested at Parnall were positive for antibodies, according to Chris Gautz, spokesman for the Michigan Department of Corrections."
24297,The department offered antibody blood tests to all prisoners at Parnall about two weeks ago.
24298,"Of 1,248 people tested, Gautz said 1,148 were positive."
24299,"""*

All the PPE won't help when you're living and working in that environment."
24300,Wouldn't it be better for the trial if you ignored all safety precautions?
24301,"If you're being careful, researchers won't know if the vaccine works or not."
24302,Es ist was es ist
24303,you do you.... every state will differ on what portion of the population they're willing to sacrifice to this disease.
24304,"Some (like California) will be be more cautious, just because it's affecting ppl of color much more than whites, and the Golden State is a majority minority state."
24305,Others will feel that those who aren't candidates for vaccination are more expendable for the greater good.
24306,It's a bioethical and moral choice that each region will have to make.
24307,Are you getting your phases confused?
24308,You don‚Äôt usually use a placebo in phase I.
24309,In phase III you would use a placebo or compare to the standard of care.
24310,Since there‚Äôs no existing vaccine you‚Äôd use a placebo.
24311,Saying something that is statistically low risk is denying the dangers?
24312,Covid can be very deadly.
24313,It's just very unlikely that will happen for the vast majority of people.
24314,"Here's an example:

There's also a very low risk of an asteroid hitting the earth."
24315,That doesn't mean an asteroid hitting the earth wouldn't be dangerous.
24316,It means focusing on the dangers 24/7 to the detriment of everything else can destroy society.
24317,Its ridiculous to do that when the risk is low for practically every person.
24318,Welcome to the media.
24319,Do you think they care?
24320,"The more shock value, the more views."
24321,Look at new York and new Jersey during March and April.
24322,People were being sent home because the hospitals were full and dying at home
24323,Israel had 9000 in one day which is about 324k adjusted to US population
24324,PRC?
24325,If you believe anything from the PRC I have a bridge in Brooklyn to sell you.
24326,"Also, they have closed their borders and two weeks mandatory quarantine for anyone entering the country."
24327,Not sustainable.
24328,Even if the virus has subsided it will return.
24329,Their claims are impossible.
24330,"Also, New Zealand reported a new case of community transmission last week."
24331,They have done an excellent job but their situation is very unique.
24332,They are a tiny country in the middle of the pacific.
24333,Not the same challenge and the most populous country in the middle of Europe with open borders.
24334,[deleted]
24335,yep..
24336,"According to your definition, NYC had a stage 1.5 to squash the virus and I'd say we're currently at 3.5 or so."
24337,"It's not ideal economically BUT cases and deaths seem to be at a ""sustainable"" level such that we can limp along."
24338,Can we do this for 2 more years ?
24339,"No, not likely.. Can we keep this up for another 6-9 months, abso-friggin-lutely, especially if we can manage to get people and businesses the support they need."
24340,Phase III Moderna over here.

24347,"Maybe rather than trying to come up with neat insults for me, and trying to decipher my age you could simply understand my point..But here we are ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

&gt;all that shit is why I carry now, learning from experience and all that

And it's clearly changed so much for you as you've had no reason to for years now... but please, call everyone else pansies for not wanting to spread this disease (there's your hint on what I'm ""on about"") 

&gt;You are making a bunch of dumbass assumptions

Which assumptions did I make?"
24348,"That you're scared of something that is statistically less likely than spreading a communicable, respiratory virus?"
24349,"(Look, there's hint two!)"
24350,I think I didn't get my point across clearly.
24351,And what you're saying is absolutely true and I don't doubt politicians and their campaign teams have their priorities set in something else.
24352,"What I'm trying to say is, number of people dying/being hospitalized is what determines lock down or no lock down."
24353,"If December rolls around and daily reported cases is like 50, nothing much is going to happen."
24354,"If by next week reported cases jump up to 50000 per day and it's a upwards trend, something is going to happen."
24355,I can't say lock down for certain.
24356,"Youu can manipulate the numbers to a certain degree, if you aren't testing people obviously the number of reported cases will stay low."
24357,"But if ICU beds begin to run low, hospitals are being over run, and larger than normal number of people are dying, I believe social media and news cycle will pick up on something even if there are massive testing."
24358,"Now I'm no scientist, so what I'm saying are all based off things I've read and other information I've picked up from talking to people, some work in the medical field."
24359,"So obviously I could be wrong, but I believe there's a general consensus that there's a possible big outbreak in the near future."
24360,So it's a big if.
24361,"IF the outbreak they foresee doesn't come, there's isn't a point of a lock down and obviously there won't be one."
24362,"IF another massive outbreak hits, then people will notice and government will be forced to do something."
24363,"When I said you implied this is a political issue, I meant it sounded like you're saying politicians gets to decide if an outbreak happens."
24364,"If I misunderstood you, sorry."
24365,Dude you were the one crying about other people laughing ain't nobody in their feelings but u
24366,Your obvious frustration are showing.

24368,"I live in the South, where the bogeyman is waiting to steal my ballot if I don't vote in person."
24369,"We didn't get massive countrywide shutdowns, if we had maybe we wouldn't still have such a goddamn problem with the virus."
24370,"We had a half-assed, uncoordinated series of shutdowns by a good portion of the US states."
24371,When you don't know what a straw man argument is :p
24372,Climate change will not destroy most of the planet.
24373,Infact not even all the nukes in the world can destroy the planet rn.
24374,"Climate change will be tough to deal with but humans can adapt as they have for thousands of years only thing that could possibly make us extinct is an asteroid event that is similar to the dinosaurs, solar flares or if humanity mines all uranium in the world to make nukes and destroy ourselves."
24375,Even still the planet will live through all of that.
24376,Deaths have spiked majorly over Europe.
24377,EU was consistently under 150 deaths a day for months.
24378,EU deaths were over 1100 yesterday.
24379,"That is not staying the same, so far or otherwise."
24380,"Now France and Spain are significantly over that 150 daily ceiling that EU saw for months on their own, and Czech, again on its own, is approaching that number."
24381,There's nothing doubtful that letting it continue to spread without the mitigations of April would let it substantially surpass the spread of April.
24382,Of course mitigations are going to happen because no government can handle the current rate of growth for much longer.
24383,"Remember, the guy from WHO is NOT saying that Europe will be 4-5 times worse than April."
24384,"It's really important to note that he's not saying this, he's referring to hypothetical conditions that *will not happen*."
24385,It's really sad to see.
24386,"Some extremists, go around with a mask on their face, but cutout."
24387,"They literally cut off the part of the mask that covers the mouth, making a little window exposing mouth and nose, and wear it like it was regular."
24388,"&amp;#x200B;

You can't fake this shit, this is really happening and these people are throwing away months and months of lockdown (and the lockdown worked, we were touching zero cases in july."

24422,"According to that draft plan, yes."
24423,I‚Äôm guessing it‚Äôs because we socialize more.

24427,It must be a suburban thing.

24429,"I went to an outdoor market and man it was full as well, I‚Äôd have been more worried if masks weren‚Äôt mandatory."
24430,The obvious frustration herd immunity isn't working.
24431,"Hey bud, just stopping by to tell you I also have narcolepsy."
24432,I developed it when I was 15 after a horrible bout of Mono.
24433,Aren't we the lucky ones?
24434,"During my last appointment, my neurologist and I were heaving a conversation about COVID-19 and got on the subject of potential long term complications."
24435,"She brought up the point that it's quite possible we may see a surge of auto-immune illnesses and disorders due to COVID, for the exact reason you pointed out‚Äîthere are tons of studies that strongly suggest the onset of Narcolepsy can be triggered by a immuno-response to a viral or bacterial infection in individuals who have the ""right"" genetic code."
24436,"Also, jsyk, the /r/Narcolepsy community is super supportive and welcoming if you ever need a place to talk!"
24437,Don't know.
24438,"I do know that usually there's a deal with countries that are doing phase 3 trials of Chinese vaccines that they earn the right to produce the vaccine domestically for their people in the event of success, so presumably UAE can also make it, and maybe even export it to surrounding countries in that region."
24439,"I say UAE because Brazil said they are still expanding their trial program from 9,000 to 15,000, so surely that one would go for a while longer."
24440,"Brazil is trialling for Sinovac, UAE (plus some other countries, but UAE is furthest along) is trialling for Sinopharm."
24441,"Another reason why I think Sinopharm and UAE are on the money is because very recently Bahrain also joined and started a phase 3 trial of the two Sinopharm vaccines, with the crown prince himself getting vaccinated."
24442,Perhaps the royal family of Bahrain popped next door to UAE and got the inside scoop on the phase 3 trial progress and judged that they've seen enough to be convinced.
24443,"Joining phase 3 at this late stage seems a bit pointless from testing perspective, but then it does mean Bahrain also becomes one of the countries that earned the right to make their own Sinopharm vaccine if the success result is announced."
24444,There's probably some money to be made there getting that license.

24482,Counting only American deaths in Vietnam makes as much sense as counting only Vietnamese COVID deaths in the US.
24483,"If you want to do a comparison with American war deaths, then use the one war where most of the victims were indeed American."

24487,There's also regular influenza type A mingling with bird flu H5N1.
24488,The latter is just a couple mutations away from being a pandemic strain.
24489,H5N1 has a 60% CFR.
24490,That's a really good question

24504,Then the [Black Death](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Death) would win hands down.
24505,In some regions in Europe it killed up to 2/3 of the population in less than 10 years.
24506,In general it killed 40 to 50% of the entire population in Europe in just 4 years.
24507,4 years for every second person to die!
24508,Now that's some Thanos shit.
24509,After which it took 200 years for population levels to restore back to pre black death levels.
24510,Without the black death we might already have 10 billion people on the planet.
24511,Travelling on a horse is much faster compared to walking but considering that C19 moves so fast I wonder if it may have been too deadly.
24512,"Not saying it‚Äôs your fault, but the article uses many words to say he wants more resting sites and wants to throw some money at states."
24513,"Hardly much of a plan, and some states don‚Äôt need more testing at this point"
24514,"And when the teacher is sick, who will teach?"
24515,This is so counterintuitive
24516,"TL;DR: America needs normalcy

At this point, it‚Äôs worth noting that there are a number of Americans, like myself and partner, who have been paying close attention to Europe."
24517,"We‚Äôre already gearing up to tell the family we are not planning on attending Christmas, Thanksgiving has been a moot point since cases went up in my area after the students came back (August)."
24518,I personally am not baffled by the entitlement and ignorance around me; I pretend like I am to my partner to not seem so pessimistic.
24519,"Americans haven‚Äôt given a damn about each other, much less anyone else, since the Puritans landed."
24520,"All these nice words about ‚ÄúAll men are created equal‚Äù were written by white, male, slavers."
24521,"After the World Wars and beating Russia to the Moon, Americans started fist-pumping about how great America was, and thus the era of American Exceptionalism was born, and with it, blind patriotism."
24522,"Generations have been taught since about how great America is, and how we‚Äôre the best country in the world."
24523,"We sing patriotic anthems without thinking, we force children to recite a pledge to a fancy piece of cloth, and now, some equate voting for the worst political threat the US has ever produced to being a True American."
24524,"Meanwhile, very few actually question publicly *if* we still are great (obvious no)."
24525,"The people I see around me are tired, wearied, misguided, and so so very scared."
24526,"They want their comfortable world back, and are trying to force it by pretending everything is fine until it isn‚Äôt."
24527,"They see a world on fire, that is losing traditions and the security that comes with routine, and they drown themselves in work, screens, substances, and food, until they sufficiently numb themselves to the reality: the rest of the modern world is light years ahead of the US in education, social policy and welfare, happiness, and yes, COVID response."
24528,"This is why Halloween goes on, why Black Friday will still be madness, and why we‚Äôll see outbreaks after Thanksgiving, Christmas, and New Years."
24529,"This is why Florida has no mandated masks, why sports fans will pack stadiums when given the opportunity, and why the US is going to lose more people to COVID than we did to the Spanish Flu."

24540,"It disproportionally affects brown people, so, no, they instead laughed and went to Trump rallies."
24541,Park the refrigerated trucks right in front of the hospital so people can see.
24542,I lost relatives in this.
24543,I know how heartbreaking it is.
24544,If our loss is shown in the daylight then maybe a couple more people will take it seriously.
24545,Thank you.
24546,"The problem with the common cold is that there's a huge load of different viruses that cause it, only the symptoms look the same."
24547,This is why we can't build up proper immunity (also because there's no selection pressure to do so because it doesn't kill us).
24548,"But there's only one covid19 causing virus, and its spike proteins haven't changed so far."
24549,"From [https://www.dhs.wisconsin.gov/covid-19/county.htm](https://www.dhs.wisconsin.gov/covid-19/county.htm) it looks like most of the problem is Milwaukee, Madison, and Green Bay."

24559,"about 300,000

any other questions?"
24560,1 death a day is about 100 deaths per day less than the flu.
24561,That's an unrealistic target for the US.
24562,Something like 50 deaths per day for the US would be achievable and would be seen as a success.
24563,This isn't true.
24564,People are trying to make a universal flu vaccine.
24565,The problem with the flu is that it mutates so often.
24566,The universal vaccine if it works should provided protection from all strains.
24567,I guess we can hope this mutates into that right?
24568,Wishful thinking?
24569,Trying to stay positive and be optimistic.
24570,"That's plenty of time, but the level of infectiousness is not consistent before you show symptoms."
24571,You are most infectious the day before symptoms.
24572,"Add in masks and social distancing, maybe even a vaccine, and it becomes more daunting for the virus to spread."
24573,Not to mention that mutations will keep occurring randomly.
24574,It's simply the more infectious mutations that tend to spread.
24575,We have 4 common coronaviruses.
24576,They likely started similar to this one.
24577,It's just a matter of weathering it until we can manage it at a level where it really is similar to a cold.
24578,We'll get there.
24579,Thats the general consensus.
24580,"&gt; it wasn‚Äôt a lockdown

Well I guess those tens of millions of unemployed, -33% GDP, and 1 in 5 small businesses busted and 'never coming back' just magically appeared out of nothing I guess"
24581,I honestly don't know how to interpret this because I've heard so much contrary stuff.
24582,Just heard another interview and the expert said they weren't doing much differently now in his ward compared to the beginning.
24583,It's still pneumonia treatment after all.
24584,"Maybe they were just killing more people in the highly affected areas in March, I've heard that statement for Bergamo before."
24585,Lungs were shredded.
24586,And people avoided hospitals if they could still breathe somewhat.
24587,"We know that when they came in in NYC or Bergamo, they were often on the verge of collapse and needed to be intubated immediately."
24588,They have more knowledge today but there was no wonder drug discovered (e.g.
24589,"look at the recent findings on Remdesivir), certainly nothing to pull down mortality from 25 to 7%."
24590,That what some scientists believe.
24591,Look up the russia flu from 1890.
24592,True.
24593,I should have said antibiotics instead.
24594,Research on autopsy reports from the 1918 pandemic showed that 85-90% of those that died succumbed to secondary bacterial infections that took advantage of the damage caused to the lungs by the initial infection.
24595,Spanish Flu wouldn't have killed as many people if antibiotics were as available as they are today.
24596,"Conversely, if Covid 19 happened back then, it would have likely had similar results due to the damage it does to the lungs as well."
24597,"This country is filled with enough brainless, cold hearted shitheads that I would say, yeah, many of them would."
24598,I just started as a shipt shopper today and this is cracking me up!

24600,pubs and restaurants are not yet closed in the UK?
24601,Your position is utter nonsense.
24602,"If an infected person is 1-2 meters / 3-6 feet away from others, then it doesn't make a damn of difference where it is."
24603,It's not as if droplets explode on aircraft.
24604,"Those who are flying have to hope that they aren't seated near infected people, then get lucky if they do."
24605,Same as is true anywhere else.

24621,Not for us.

24630,Let‚Äôs focus on the ‚Äúpatently false‚Äù part of this.
24631,If we suppress it further certainly we can reduce deaths when a successful vaccine arrives.
24632,But what if that doesn‚Äôt happen for many years?
24633,What does suppressing it further do in the a sense of a vaccine?
24634,It‚Äôs measurably and objectively significantly more dangerous than driving a car.

24642,You have a limited view of what being old means.
24643,People at risk are not just bed-ridden ancient Liches.
24644,"Fifty and sixty year olds, seventy and eighty year olds are all at risk, and most of those, today, are almost as active as you."
24645,Only the unfortunate end up in nursing homes.
24646,"For example, I am sixty."
24647,"I write, illustrate, play video games, dive into virtual reality, and still have time to be wife to my three life partners."
24648,"I also study and make board games, paint miniatures and construct scenery, and play tabletop wargames."
24649,I am probably into more interesting and exciting things than most young people.
24650,"But, I am sixty, and that puts me at risk from young people who think that people like me 'don't have long to live' and don't have any reason to live."
24651,"I have novels to write, online cartoons to continue, and countless games to play."
24652,I am eager for the Playstation 5 and Xbox Series X. I easily have another twenty to thirty years left - and I do not want that stolen from me by some punk who has to party during a goddamn fucking global pandemic!
24653,"When you write off people my age, you are shitting in my face."

24658,"You moronic, sociopathic shitpig."
24659,Fuck you!
24660,Ehhh...
24661,Okay.
24662,On one hand a 4-5 week shutdown will reduce cases 90%.
24663,That's proven.
24664,"However, it's also been proven the final 5-10% of cases remaining are much more difficult to eliminate."
24665,You can spend another 4-5 weeks of shutdown attempting to eliminate the remaining community spread.
24666,"On the other hand, the anti-shutdown folks are also bad at math."
24667,"The idea of 2 months of shutdown sounded like crazy talk, but looking back, two months of shutdown, followed by opening gyms, schools, life in general is a helluva lot better than this alternative we've chosen."
24668,"In the future, we should take some lessons learned from this pandemic."
24669,Act fast to keep the pandemic from getting in your country in the first place is a million times cheaper and more humane to your citizens.
24670,"If you have cases in a city or state, isolate, contact trace, and quarantine, and shutdown the area quickly."
24671,"Combine the fact that we've become (or maybe we were all along, but was never really tested?)"
24672,extremely mentally weak with the fact that we've become extremely stupid and we've got here.
24673,Nah.
24674,Satire is usually clever and amusing.
24675,Treat post COVID-19 patients and wear an n95 everyday.
24676,Am doing this till a vaccine is available and I'm ditching the mask for good (except around active cases).
24677,Your reasoning is flawed as fuck though.
24678,Punishing people by way of denying healthcare services is fucked.
24679,I‚Äôll take that as a yes.

24691,The president of North Dakota should be embarrassed
24692,"Ok so if the guy is on the placebo arm and gets so sick that he might die, why not switch him over to the vaccine arm?"
24693,That's because flu testing isn't that big a thing.
24694,"I have been sick several times with respiratory stuff, and a world famous medical center has never once tested me for flu."
24695,"And to be fair, why would they?"
24696,What difference does it make?
24697,"By the time I show up, it is too late for stuff like tamiflu."
24698,"&gt;	Literally Africa, Europe and Asia don‚Äôt even need a boat, there are land routes."
24699,You sure are digging in your heels here.
24700,So no one uses a boat to navigate the Nile River in North Africa?
24701,How about the Rhine River in Germany?
24702,The Yangtze?
24703,"And no one uses ships to cross the Mediterranean, or the Black Sea, or the English Channel, or the Philippine Sea?"
24704,Those are all just barren bodies of water with nary a ship in sight?
24705,"Regardless, if you‚Äôre looking to talk about only trans-Atlantic or trans-Pacific crossings, you‚Äôre still awfully misinformed about how long these ocean journeys took a hundred years ago."
24706,"In the mid 1800s, we have evidence that the voyage between New York and Liverpool took around three weeks to a month."
24707,"[1](https://www.rmg.co.uk/discover/behind-the-scenes/blog/18th-century-sailing-times-between-english-channel-and-coast-america)

After the advent of steam ships, the amount of time spent during a trans-Atlantic crossing is even shorter."
24708,"In 1838, the crossing would have taken around 15 and a half days‚Äîby the 1860s, this time was shortened to eight days."
24709,"[2](https://transportgeography.org/?page_id=2135)

By the early 20th century, journeys were faster than ever before."
24710,The RMS Olympia made its maiden voyage from Southampton to New York in only seven days.
24711,"[3](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/RMS_Olympic) And in 1907, the Mauretania was able to cross the Atlantic in only 4.5 days."
24712,"The length of each of these journeys are reasonably within the time-frame of the incubation period (2-14 days) and the period of infectiousness (10-20 days), according to the CDC."
24713,"[4](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/hcp/faq.html)

With all due respect, you're a fucking moron."
24714,Because it will help and is a critical part of getting the population to a level of herd immunity that will make living with the virus manageable.
24715,It just won‚Äôt be the magic bullet a lot of people seem to think it is.
24716,"Consider that naturally, we‚Äôve only had ~1% of the country exposed to this virus."
24717,The vaccine will boost that substantially but it won‚Äôt save us from the years-long effort necessary to really get us to ‚Äúherd immunity.‚Äù
24718,Do you really want the extent of lockdown here what prc had?
24719,Gimme a break.
24720,"I think when this is all said and done, we are maybe a third of the way through this, those people will learn."
24721,"If I had a farm, I'd bet it on him being drugged up the wazoo with painkillers and steroids for the sake of public appearances."
24722,"Once he loses and vacates the White House, we'll find out just how bad it really was."
24723,I think that anyone advocating for herd immunity should be first in line to voluntarily be infected with Covid.... and should receive absolutely no health care.
24724,Thank you for your sober thoughts on this tough topic.
24725,Dr. Yasmin what is the best possible outcome for our country and can you provide a timeline of what that looks like?
24726,"Also, even with a viable vaccine what is the probability that some enforcement at the local, state or federal level needs to be enacted to stop the spread?"
24727,"Right, they need severe COVID cases in the placebo arm, as horrible as that sounds"

24735,"Hence your coin flipping is a very poor analogy, because the coin is very highly skewed to land on the recovery side."

24737,"But its the nature of the coin, that you obviously fail to comprehend."
24738,"I work for a local school district and every once in a while, will pop into a school board meeting."
24739,Parks and Rec is essentially a documentary.
24740,"The southern hemisphere pretty much had no flu season, think we will be ok on that one this year."
24741,TBF I don't think anyone who was anti vaccine in the first place was gonna read it anyways
24742,Lockdown prevented the collapse of the whole health system.
24743,Or do you think we should have not admitted people into hospitals when they ran out of beds and should have left them to die?
24744,This is a massive misnomer that comes out in correlations all the time.
24745,"We find in all sorts of stuff that people with low vitamin d are more likely ill, but equally people who are infirm and thus more likely to get ill are also more likely to stay indoors"
24746,"I think when he said ""those involved"" he meant the people conducting the experiment, not the subjects."
24747,"But during the study, no one else knows."
24748,"Not the patient, not the person administering the vaccine, not even the people who are tracking results and side effects."
24749,"If someone were to accidentally give away who had which dose, it would change behaviors and ruin the study."
24750,Well yeah.. but the 3 patients that have gotten transverse myelitis from the actual vaccine doesn't look good either.

24761,"It's so damn hot under the mask that I'm sweating even more than usual, making it increasingly uncomfortable under there."
24762,I think I also have like the worst possible facial attributes for working out in a mask too.
24763,I have a full beard which is annoying and can make the mask straight up wet if I take a drink of water and spill some onto my beard then put the mask back on.
24764,"And I also wear glasses so I literally cannot see shit unless I'm deliberately inhaling to de-fog them briefly, even though all my workout masks are specifically supposed to help with glasses fogging."

24790,6 months average immunity duration does seem fairly incompatible with the fact that Spring break was almost 6 months ago.
24791,So we should be seeing a whole lot more reinfection than a few disjoint reports (if immunity did disappear for ~50% of Spring Covid19 patients).
24792,"Time for napkin math: some areas (London, Stockholm) had 10-20% infection rates achieved in Spring (as estimated by serology studies), so, naively, one would expect that if immunity disappears after 6 months for 50% of infected, then these ares would see 5-10% of new infections being reinfections..."
24793,Which I don't think is the case.
24794,A major statistical wrinkle here is this: most (~90%+) of Spring infections went undetected.
24795,"So many people would not know (or would have the test) to confirm the fact of the Spring infection...So, reinfections-as-confirmed-by-positive-PCR-test (in Spring and Fall) might be as low as 0.5-1% even with a 6-month immunity duration..."
24796,I've seen articles about lots of different EU nations setting peaks and/or establishing new restrictions.
24797,"Poland, Czech Republic, and Ireland immediately come to mind."
24798,"Oh 80-90% of our Parliament are more or less poor politicians, some much worse, some just plain poor"
24799,"No, I got that."
24800,The virus becomes more of a risk to you as your health deteriorates.
24801,That's not exactly astrophysics.
24802,"But it is a massive, massive stretch to think that this will actually take place on a large scale (my distinction between *possible* and *common*)."
24803,"Because in the meantime, we're finding ways to inhibit the virus from replicating, to prevent the associated disease from becoming severe, and to immunize people against the virus."
24804,"As evidence: in the last 4-5 months, a study showed that we've seen a ~70% drop in hospitalized patient mortality across all age groups."
24805,"As therapies improve and vaccines become available, the scenario that you described will become more and more rare, the cases more obscure."
24806,"In a sense: yes, the scenario you described would be a concern if we did nothing in response to the virus."
24807,But that's not a realistic assumption.
24808,Getting out of that whiskey tango gathering with *only* Covid should be considered a victory.

24813,"You might want to explore if you have breathing issues like asthma, there."
24814,"Look at South East Asia countries, Vietnam with 2.5x the population has had about half the cases as Canada has had deaths."
24815,Europe and the Americas have been doing terribly with containing it.
24816,Some countries in those regions have simply been more terrible than others.
24817,"""Locking people up and letting them die alone"" aka providing care for elderly people at their own homes and apartments until that no longer suffices and they get moved to an elderly care building because theh√§y require 24h contact with a careworker?"

24823,There is a theory that viral load increases the severity of the virus.
24824,So maybe he got a particulary high dose while working
24825,"At least in Italy, we didn't have many ICU beds back then, so we ran out of them very quickly and whole wards had to be quickly reconverted into covid wards."
24826,We also didn't have enough ventilators.
24827,"We have more ICU beds now, more ventilators, better knowledge of how to treat the virus, and we're testing more."
24828,"Back then they were only testing those who showed moderate or severe symptoms, now we're testing a lot of asymptomatics."
24829,"One of the Oxford trials used a meningitis vaccine, I'm not sure that it's this one."
24830,"The reason that some trials don't just use sterile salt water as a placebo is because sometimes volunteers can figure out what they got based on a lack of arm soreness, redness at injection site and other common vaccine side effects."
24831,I don't think you do.
24832,"You're pretending ""if we just let people die, at least the economy will remain viable""."
24833,And that's not the case.
24834,No one out there had been making 10% and 20% margins where losing a few customers is no big deal.
24835,"If there are a million dead customers (or even fewer, most likely), that's still your economy spinning into oblivion right there."
24836,"It would be better to delay that business, and be able to pick back up afterward."
24837,Because there won't be an afterward.
24838,The only good (morbid) news is that there might be more job openings than usual.
24839,"Yup, each corona virus has a little timer and after 15 minutes it can‚Äôt infect you"
24840,"Especially if the 100k deaths are among those ""old and in the way"" in nursing homes, like flu deaths, society will look the other way."

24854,That isn't the case for a lot of people.
24855,"Replying to my own comment, since I found a study about the prevalence of restriction sites in viruses."
24856,"This paper is about genetic engineering of another coronavirus, TGEV."
24857,"The restriction sites that were mentioned as smoking gun in the conspiracy paper were EcoRI and BstXI, of which the former is probably the most used restriction enzyme in the world and the other is quite rare."
24858,"Normal BstXI requires difficult conditions for operating, but there is a version available which works in standard conditions."
24859,"Funnily in this another paper they mention EcoRI (which is not surprising) but they also talk lengthly about BstXI, which is practically unheard among most gene jockeys."

24865,&gt; It's also not entirely untrue that there are many businesses and business owners that would be ruined by a shutdown.
24866,"You'll bring up anything to try to score a point, won't you?"
24867,"Just curious since we're apparently going wildly off topic, what's your number of ""too many people are dying"" for you to consider a shutdown worthwhile?"
24868,panic and distrust is what sells 0.2 cent advertising click revenue... sensibility has no place in a monetized news system!
24869,"edit: and people are already willing to spout off wild conspiracy theories about this stuff, covid has brought paranoia and distrust to the main stream in recent months and article titles that agree with peoples already tarnished views usually sell the best... i remember 10 years ago when you followed conspiracy videos you used to keep quiet because you KNEW that it made you look absolutely crazy to talk about it in the mainstream.. now its popular culture..."
24870,Exactly.
24871,"In short, you're measuring how effective something is against not doing anything."
24872,"If participants know you're doing nothing, they actually react differently, so you have to administer something soon that they don't know

Ideally, neither the participants, nor those giving the drug, know whether it's real or placebo"
24873,"Just wait for the social media shit storm after either:

1."
24874,Someone dies even after getting vaccine.
24875,2.
24876,Somebody dies from a side effect from the vaccine.
24877,People suck a risk management and social media makes matters worse.
24878,All of this.
24879,"Russia, Turkey, and Egypt are the three countries I doubt the most from a purely intentional cover up."
24880,China and Iran I give some credence to the idea that they don‚Äôt even know the true number (especially Iran).
24881,Well you could use Amazon or Walmart and than no one would have to go to the store.
24882,"But thanks for telling me that, it reveals that you're perfectly fine with putting someone else in a situation you believe is a risk to their health."
24883,How elitist of you.
24884,What about deaths?
24885,Are they correlating with the cases?
24886,Ok so why can't they just do that at Disneyland?
24887,Wait earlier when I said going to work was too risky and we should lockdown you agreed.
24888,So why don't you just do that yourself?
24889,"They will be asymptomatic for Covid at the date of infection, but once they get infected by a different virus, whether afterward or concurrently, that secondary infection might provoke an overreaction of your immune system that basically maims you."
24890,"That, in a nutshell, is what happens to children who had very mild cases of COVID, but who subsequently developed MIS-C. MIS-C is what is causing heart problems in those kids unfortunate enough to have it triggered by a new viral infection."
24891,It will change behavior for some.
24892,"For others, they will carry on as usual."
24893,Most people in my area can‚Äôt even be bothered to put a mask on in public.

24898,article states that they want to soften restrictions for people 70 and more.
24899,"I have received the vaccine already (Novavax' Phase II, one of only \~1600) and have received both shots (not placebo, it was a 5-arm trial thus I already had an 80% chance of getting the vaccine the first shot, and the second shot had some reaction to it)."
24900,"Anyway this piece is great to read - custom packaging to ensure -70C storage for 10 days, plenty of time to get to point of need."
24901,And 5K doses in a space that is pretty compact - only 16x16x22.
24902,"Also nice to see how Pfizer is working independently of OWS, inside or outside of it the logistics of distribution is going to be difficult."
24903,"On mask-wearing, I still wear a mask per local guidelines and do not presume that I am immune."
24904,"Yea I also didn‚Äôt know about it until recently

Hint: it was also in the article, if you had read it

24919,I am not a journalist myself.
24920,I will try to look for the sources you suggested but the journalists here have started a domino effect of internal metoo accusations.
24921,"I have been trying to circulate awareness about the possible involvement of Uighur workers in production of chinese PPE, since it hasn't been mentioned here at all but there is so much going on with the metoo movement, and it seems to keep a lot of people preoccupied."
24922,"Thanks a lot for your time and involvement, I will remember the #PledgetoPause"
24923,"Even if he had not taken the placebo, if he had died from COVID, this only says that the vaccine is not 100% efficient, why would they need to halt the trial if the death wasn‚Äôt directly cause by the vaccine‚Äôs adverse effects(explore ADE?)"
24924,?
24925,"Pfizer will almost certainly be first, but seeing J&amp;J start again is a good sign."
24926,"One dose, huge company, easy on the logistics."
24927,This is the kind of vaccine to get us to herd immunity.
24928,Seasonal flu is dangerous and the yearly vaccine not completely effective is due to [antigenic shift](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antigenic_shift) which is not a feature of coronaviridae.
24929,The reason its not 100% effective each year is fundamentally different from effectiveness of other viral vaccine targets.
24930,"I know this may seem pedantic, but it is clinically and scientifically different."
24931,"Yes, there are tests performed to declare brain death."
24932,"If the patient is declared brain dead, they are dead."
24933,"Even with support, the patients other organs will begin to fail after brain death and therefore time is of the essence if the patient is an organ donor."
24934,"Furthermore the scenario I think a lot of people are worried about is that they get groceries delivered, to avoid going to the store themselves, and the delivery person happens to have it."
24935,"In that case the groceries have been in an enclosed space with an infectious person for 10+ minutes, and then almost immediately moved to a dark cool place."
24936,"lul, I don't think you can say that at all!"
24937,"Although adverse events leading to death due to FDA approved vaccines may be vanishingly rare, they are certainly not impossible."
24938,"But what we're talking about here is /u/pudding7 volunteering to participate in a vaccine trial, which seems like it would carry at least some more risk."
24939,Thanks go to /u/pudding7 for putting himself out there for the benefit of the rest of us!
24940,I think this could be the best way to find a vaccine with sterilising immunity.

25096,"edit: nevermind, I understand the argument now."
25097,I do think that community transmission will go way down once a vaccine is out though.
25098,The placebo was another vaccine (meningitis)
25099,  Fuck off with your condescending fake nice bullshit.
25100,Your attitude is exactly why people justify putting my life in danger by not wearing a mask or social distancing.

25106,I'm sorry to hear that.
25107,Probably are also the ones far less needing of a vaccine (short term) since they likely already were infected.
25108,No.
25109,It would be the opposite.
25110,You cannot make calls on 50%.
25111,"If they are going to recommend masks at some point, it is going to be hard to get people to use them."
25112,Same happened in Finland and Netherlands.
25113,Officials were first skeptical about masks and when they eventually made the recommendation people were skeptical about them.
25114,Tegnell is shitting on his own doorstep with his statements about masks.
25115,But maybe I'm wrong since Sweden is probably the only Western country without mask recommendation and people see what's happening elsewhere.
25116,"Immediate family 3 including both my parents whom she spent several hours in a car ride because they were heading to my dad s side family (so our aunts, uncles, cousins their kids etc... which is close to 20 people) because one of my cousin was having the christening of his 1yo son."
25117,She said she was being careful and not hugging/kissing (in cheeks which is very common in france as a way to say hello more than hugs) and was sitting more apart of the people during the dinner (she had a slightly runy nose that she thought were her normal seasonal allergies but was cautious anyway) but when we are dealing with an airborne virus I doubt it matters.
25118,My mom also ate something from her plate with her fork that she (my sister) had been using...
25119,"Anyway had she been contagious it would have been a freaking superspreader event and besides my mom who has asthma (very light and has been under control for decades and she rarely even need inhaler anymore) and my 71yo grandma (wasn't at the party since it s on my mom's side) I am fairly sure I have an uncle/aunt or two that has some sort of condition, one of them being  overweight."
25120,"Also she had tested negative a couple weeks prior when there was a suspected contact with someone on her campus, so she was then completely unaware of the possible infection contact that was unrelated to the first and that she had in fact been infected and was showing symptoms that she mistook for her seasonal allergies."
25121,Placebo = saline water = not getting vaccine.
25122,Having volunteers split between placebo and vaccine is a good way of determining the efficacy of the vaccine.
25123,"If all participants were vaccinated, let's say 5% test +ve after 3 months."
25124,"There is no way of knowing how many actually got exposed to the virus, and what % of that number is that 5%."
25125,"Now, let's say you had 50% of participants get a placebo."
25126,"Then, you can reasonably assume that after 3 months, roughly equal number of participants from the placebo group, and from the vaccine group must've gotten exposure to the virus and you can determine the effectiveness of the vaccine by comparing the positive rate of placebo vs positive rate of vaccine group."
25127,"Excess deaths this year stand at 285,000, according to the article."

25296,Lol do you know the difference between a disease and a virus?
25297,It's the only way to tell whether the vaccine works in real-world conditions.
25298,You give x number of people the vaccine and x number of people the placebo.
25299,"Neither group knows whether they have the vaccine or placebo, so they behave the same way (ie."
25300,expose themselves to the same amount of risk).

25302,"You obviously can't work out whether the vaccine is effective if you don't have a control group to compare the vaccinated people to, and the control group needs to get a placebo in order to make sure that both groups behave the same way."
25303,"If you had one group of people who knew they had the vaccine and one group who knew they didn't have the vaccine, then the vaccinated people might behave differently and take more risks (because they'd feel safer)."

25316,Well the problem is i do not see a proportion between the current restrictions and the growth of the new cases.
25317,The risk is high when you have close contact with a positive in a closed space for a long time.
25318,This definition is exactly what going to school means.
25319,20 people together in the same room for 5 hours a day 6 days a week.
25320,Then they go home and spend at least other 10 hours a day at home with parents (and grandparents sometimes)..  because well at least they sleep there I assume.
25321,Then probably they use public transportation everyday which is another risk factor.
25322,What I am describing here is not a choice but a routine that these students have to follow.
25323,Considering in general people are asymptomatic but this is expecially true for young people there is definitely something dangerous happening daily.
25324,This reasoning is also valid for workplaces that do not enforce smart working.
25325,Maybe less people will be asymptomatic because they are older.
25326,Maybe more people will use scooters or cars.
25327,But the risk is still there.

25384,"Ya, I can't believe Cuomo and Newsom are out there putting doubts in people's minds right now about a vaccine..."
25385,What credentials do you have to make such declarative statements?
25386,I'm pretty sure I already know but figured I'd ask just to be safe.

25390,"Yes I agree, as my confidence level in modern medicine is and has been low per the same analysis of most studies preformed overall (not only in vitro) for the majority of vaccines and antivirals/antibiotics/antibacterials."
25391,"I certainly understand how development in drugs work, throughout history."
25392,That understanding is what lead to my overall dissatisfaction.
25393,I may not have a medical background however I have a statistical analysis background.
25394,After years of reviewing data from medical studies I have come to the realization that modern medicine and homeopathic medicine are not much different when it comes to methodology in studies and presentation of the results.
25395,And that most data have some undeniable outliers or flaws but only certain ones are pointed and accepted if made by certain scienctist.
25396,"My point and efforts are directly related to the vast amount of effort everywhere to discredit, or simply say there is ""no evidence"" when in fact there is."
25397,"Like most science, it begins with an educated hypothesis."
25398,"Most people dont understand how much newly discovered information about our immune system dramatically changes our approach each decade.In the end there is a fine line between being a scientists and a ""conspiracy"" theorist and to me that's alarming."
25399,I have a problem with people treating others as conspiracy theorist and dismissing creditable scientists because it does not conform to the general census.
25400,That is a disservice to us as humans.
25401,"In fact there are a large amount of people in science who would be considered as such throughout history, but through persistence and perseverance overcoming negative bashlash it eventually becomes widely accepted."
25402,Our science in this modern era of humans could have and should have been significantly further progressed if so much effort was not put into discrediting or blind dismissals.
25403,"As a whole we are only at the tip of the iceberg for our understanding of the universe, let alone the human body."
25404,Though most average people think we have a deeper understanding.
25405,"Sure we are significantly more advanced than a 200 years ago but compared to what, basically none?"
25406,In the last decade we have more discoveries due to advancements in technology than in the last 100 years.
25407,Yet we continue to be limited by our knowledge based on trial &amp; error studies and advancements of technology.
25408,"But now Science, industry, and politics have intertwined deepy, that from, a statistical point of view, swings the pendulum very far to one direction, a direction far from the benefit of science and humans."
25409,When there are incentives aside from the overall good of humanity there will always be consequences.
25410,"I do trust science and modern medicine, more than science from 100 years ago but I acknowledge that none of it is perfect."
25411,"In science such as physics and medicine, one must always consider outside influences (x variables), same with statistics too."
25412,"Unfortunately, politics and industry have become one variable that has become a major influences in medicine."
25413,Yup.
25414,People are getting tired of this
25415,Don‚Äôt switch it up if this is actually hurting your feelings you need to unplug for a bit and go on a walk.
25416,I mean I‚Äôm sure it will not be as bad as it is now - you will be able to go to restaurants again.
25417,"But (1) you will wear a mask in areas with high prevalence, (2) you will wear a mask when possible, which is good by itself and would save lives compared to a normal flu season, (3) the longer you delay getting Covid, the better treatments will be."
25418,"It may be a long time to get to 2019 again, but it‚Äôs a spectrum."

Some people spread it to a few, some to many."
25422,Some of that may be attributable to recklessness.
25423,But some are more contagious than others.
25424,Where do you live in California??
25425,Life is definitely not ‚Äúnormal‚Äù where I live in CA.
25426,"Everyone I know is still WFH, indoor malls and gyms are still closed, indoor restaurants are closed, playgrounds are closed, kids are not in school, bars are closed, no movie theaters or music venues are open, many mom and pop shops/restaurants have permanently shut down, homelessness has skyrocketed..."
25427,I stopped going to the gym about a month or so ago after they weren't transparent about a trainer having covid.
25428,Now that cases are spiking again I don't really want to go anyways.
25429,"Doesn't matter since I can still ride, swim and hike."
25430,I eat out once or twice a week but I've only been eating outdoors if I don't do carryout.
25431,"I still have my job and work from home, same as I've done since February."
25432,I spend time with friends outdoors and distanced.
25433,I do spend time with my neighbors indoors but they WFH and none of us will be spreading the virus to at-risk people.
25434,"I did my traveling to places during a lull in cases this summer, drove over 3000 miles to do it and continued best safe covid practices."
25435,Having friends that live in Ashland they would kindly ask you not to visit them until covid has chilled out.
25436,I‚Äôm on two different prescription acne medications (which my insurance does not cover) from acne caused by masks.
25437,I was fine before I had to wear a mask every day for work.
25438,Our faces are not meant to be covered all the time.
25439,"Now I could certainly see a future where masks are more widely used, like on planes or public transportation or if you have a lingering cough after recovering from a cold."
25440,But I absolutely don‚Äôt want wearing a mask for covid to shift into well let‚Äôs just wear a mask all the time forever.
25441,&gt; Herd immunity has never been a viable option.
25442,No virus on Earth has ever caused herd immunity naturally.
25443,"They simply cannot spread to people fast enough, and they mutate before it ever becomes ubiquitous."
25444,"And the more people who have it, the more it mutates."
25445,Herd immunity only works with vaccines.
25446,"And even then, only to an extent."
25447,That's why the flu is still a thing.
25448,[removed]
25449,I don't know man.

25453,"I live in a town that is 5 miles across, and all the bordering towns are in the red zone according to that CDC map."
25454,Hooray.
25455,"Stay out of my podunk little town, plz."
25456,The point is that most people don't like wearing masks and over time fewer and fewer people will wear them.
25457,"Even in Asia the norm isn't everyone wears masks all flu season, it's if you feel sick or were exposed to someone who was sick."
25458,Because they work too cheap.
25459,Gotta get at least $1K per test out of the gummint.
25460,"Yeah, you're right."
25461,I totally agree.
25462,"I just remarked to someone else that my reasoning is flawed, in that I mistake my own risk assessment for the public one, and that's my error."
25463,"I don't feel I'm moving the goalpost, because it's been the same for me since February: 2-3 years."
25464,"But I get it that few agree, and I get it that some who do agree are forced by circumstances into risks they aren't comfortable with."
25465,Well no shit.
25466,[https://coronavirus.data.gov.uk/testing](https://coronavirus.data.gov.uk/testing)
25467,I just hope they won't do that
25468,"Yeah, covid seems to be strongly linked to opened schools -we‚Äôve closed them really fast during first wave so it was pretty mild."
25469,We‚Äôve opened them now and its a fucking tragedy.
25470,"So because this vaccine doesn‚Äôt protect 100%, like most vaccines don‚Äôt, we need to keep up masks and social distancing forever?"
25471,Please
25472,Ngl shes kinda hot.
25473,"Definitely possible, like I said just an interesting observation"
25474,I just did some calculations on a spreadsheet.
25475,"Dangerous, I know."
25476,The USA has had 8.3M confirmed cases of COVID.
25477,Some seroprevalence surveys are showing that only 1 in 10 cases were diagnosed in the early days.
25478,"Let's guess that we're doing better, so that 1 in 5 cases are caught today, which I think is extremely optimistic."
25479,"So, let's say that instead of 8.3M, we've actually had 40M cases, or 13% of the population is already exposed."
25480,"Our confirmed cases are in the 60k/day range, nationally."
25481,"If we say that the real number is probably 5x that, so 300k/day, and the growth continues linearly at about 4k more cases per day (according to recent trends over the last two months), we're looking at 20% by Christmas."
25482,40% by April.
25483,"So, adding in vaccination of highest risk, I wonder if transmission will be greatly reduced."
25484,"They're saying that 67% is herd immunity, so 40-50% seems like it'd dramatically slow things down."
25485,The masks are not required by the Japanese government.
25486,They won‚Äôt be anywhere.
25487,"And, thus, I won‚Äôt wear one."
25488,(But I want to thank you real quick for not attacking me for having a different opinion.
25489,Everyone here seems to be trying to push society in the ‚Äúnew‚Äù normal against society‚Äôs will.)
25490,My (Florida based) university just sent around an email about how we need to follow the example of the k-12 systems and offer more in person classes.
25491,"I wanted to reply, ‚ÄúSure, but we‚Äôll start seeing more and more cases then, and you‚Äôll probably have a few professors die."
25492,"But sure, why not follow the amazing lead of the k-12 schools?!"
25493,?‚Äù
25494,She literally didn‚Äôt get the vaccine smh
25495,Business depends on growth and innovation.
25496,The words of Jesus don't.
25497,They stay the same.
25498,I don't think anyone is promising this.
25499,"It's just an order of magnitude more volunteers than with typical other trials, which is really good, but testing phase is short."
25500,"But don't think that for other drugs, people are tested upside down and inside out to make sure they didn't get some chronic, silent disease from it."
25501,That is just not how it's done.
25502,"So, in the end, it boils down to the question: Get the vaccine early or risk another timespan of getting Covid."
25503,"In theory, why not?"
25504,They get more productivity out of healthy workers and sick leave can be disruptive.
25505,"If you have a tool to reduce the spread of illnesses, financially speaking, it makes more sense to use it"
25506,"&gt; flatten

Flatten the curve by maxing hospital capacity

*taps forehead*"
25507,So you think a vaccine may be out by November?
25508,Because it's the easiest way to give government a middle finger and get away with it.
25509,That is exactly what I am doing
25510,Do you?
25511,"Because hand shaking is a formal greeting, usually used in the workplace."
25512,It's not how most people greet their friends
25513,I feel like COVID-19 might only be a wake up call for a worse health crisis to come.
25514,"Unfortunately, from a global perspective, the handling of the pandemic hasn't been good for most places."
25515,The exceptions are few.
25516,"If we do not rethink the ways we are doing things right now, we won't make it through a much deadlier pandemic or another type of global crisis."
25517,"In a interconnected world like the one we live in, isolating is not possible, and we will all be affected, in one way or another."
25518,Or killing people with Rona
25519,Cats would eat us if they were bigger.
25520,I still think they are cuddly.
25521,I can understand that although what is normal is a matter of perspective.
25522,Masks are normal in asia for a long time now.
25523,I guess there is time and place for both options.
25524,You also don't get genuine human experience on social media but look where we are talking right now.
25525,Death is the worst outcome for anything.
25526,If you feel otherwise I suggest therapy.
25527,The initial lockdown certainly wasn't a waste - it saved countless lives.
25528,"But I agree with your second point - close offices, schools, hospitality - anywhere where people from different households spend a significant amount of time in a confined indoor space."
25529,That makes sense.
25530,As someone who did the Pfizer trial and had a reaction to it for a couple days... even though I know and tell myself that it has not been approved yet...
25531,I find myself being significantly less worried about it when I am shopping or at the gym.
25532,I can‚Äôt help it.
25533,I still mask but the thought that I may have some form of immunity at this point takes a lot of stress away simply by allowing me to rationalize things when I get anxiety.
25534,This will happen for a lot of people.
25535,"Without the high levels of anxiety, I also think people will start getting more and more behind reopening policies."
25536,At least on a personal level.
25537,I know someone who has postponed their wedding twice now.
25538,They flat out said they would not postpone again.
25539,Also the event industry is decimated.
25540,"I know a lot of people who are out of work because there aren't any concerts, conventions, or live events really happening."
25541,Unless you enforce mask wearing by the kids.
25542,"Taiwan did it, South Korea did it... Why is it so hard for the west to understand??"

25544,They might have been on the placebo.
25545,Half of the candidates are and half are not.
25546,Oh for fuck sake
25547,Loved the area.
25548,I still dream about having a small personal farm with livestock and crops.
25549,"That also means I'm living in Wisconsin again, and that's something I don't dream about."
25550,You can't get the process right from the end result and the process makes the end result work.
25551,A vaccine is not a chemical drug you can just look up a formula for.
25552,"Every vaccine is a complex biological drug, and in the case of Sinovac is an inactivated virus that was inactivated in a precise way to not reproduce while still maintaining antigens."
25553,If you fuck up the inactivation process either the antigens change or you have live coronavirus.
25554,???

As an idiot layperson, I don‚Äôt know how many people who are otherwise healthy ended up getting diabetes from COVID."
25575,"And I don‚Äôt know how many people who got the swine flu ended up developing diabetes either, but the study linked suggests it‚Äôs a 2 fold increase and that‚Äôs with controlling for environmental factors."
25576,So what do we have?
25577,A ton of anecdotal accounts from doctors on the ground saying that a very infectious virus is also causing diabetes.
25578,And a single study that says there‚Äôs a 2 fold increase with diabetes after the swine flu.
25579,It seems to me that this is very similar to other coronavirus fears.
25580,"That is, that they highlight how little the academic community knows about viruses and the damage they cause everyday."
25581,Right now COVID is under the microscope in a way no virus has ever been in the history of humanity.

25583,"I don't want to watch the world burn, and as a random Redditor, I have a masters in Biology and understand how vaccinations work."
25584,IF they get a successful candidate it will at MOST be about 10-15% successful.
25585,The random garbage that they put into the vaccine has a greater chance of causing a systemic inflammatory response than the actual vaccine being effective.
25586,"Antibodies are known to last only weeks to this virus anyways, so if you by some chance successfully get vaccinated with an effective vaccine that produces antibodies, you would have to get one literally every month to be covered."
25587,"The companies that make the vaccine could care less about LONG TERM response, as long as it produces an antibody response in a minute amount of the testing cohort, they will get their billions and care less about the fallout."
25588,"But hey, Fuck science unless you agree with it, right?"
25589,"Think outside usa, argentina has a 9 month lockdown until now with mandatory mask and they reach more than 1 million affected, not a complete solution."

Why does this bot exist?"
25627,"Google does a lot of tracking, which many people don't want, so they use alternatives to their services."
25628,"Using AMP, they can track you even more, and they might even replace ads with their own, stealing ad revenue from the site's owners."
25629,"Since there's no consistent way of finding the original links from an AMP link, I made this bot which automatically does it for you."
25630,I don‚Äôt think the virus will ever disappear but that doesn‚Äôt mean mask and social distancing is going to last forever.
25631,We shouldn‚Äôt be trying to eradicate the virus and get used to the fact that this virus will always be around and some people will die from it.

25645,The only thing that has changed is that most women have multiple kids from multiple dads.

25651,You honestly think the government is gonna mandate masks *after* the pandemic subsides?
25652,"Yeah, they‚Äôre not, and so because it‚Äôs not, I won‚Äôt."
25653,And I know I‚Äôm not the only one.
25654,Sweden had 6 Covid deaths today.
25655,And the number I cited was total deaths per million.
25656,You can view those here.
25657,"And see how Norway and Finland, which neighbor Sweden did much better."
25658,And they haven‚Äôt averaged 0 deaths per day any week since the pandemic started.
25659,So the idea they are at zero deaths simply isn‚Äôt true.
25660,https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/#countries
25661,Lol.
25662,It‚Äôs one of half a dozen vaccines being developed right now.
25663,Russia ia testing three and China testing several aa well.
25664,People were ignoring those because they want ‚ÄúAmerican‚Äù or ‚ÄúEuropean‚Äù vaccine for some reason.
25665,"FYI: Numbers were already in August and dropped a bit in September, now these are rising fast."
25666,Uh so highest level since August just means higher than September...

25676,"Still, I ran into my first anti-masker the other day; asked a guy for directions and he did the ""I can't hear you, you have a mask on"" thing."
25677,Probably inevitable in a county that voted over 70 percent conservative.
25678,"In spite of being old, plus having a compromised respiratory system and asthma; I still find myself wearing my mask when driving home, or for a half hour or more after signing for a delivery."
25679,Because I simply forget that I'm wearing it.
25680,"I know some people claim masks physically impair them, but I'm pretty sure that's entirely because they fixate on the mask and can't stop themselves from thinking about it being on their face."
25681,"If my theory is correct, then the constant reports of anti-maskers losing their self control is only natural."
25682,"After all, they cannot even control their own thoughts and feelings."

This isn't just a negative..."

25715,Haha thanks brother ;)
25716,"Then why are you telling people treatment now is no better than when we knew nothing, and months of effort to improve them have all been wasted?"
25717,That's pretty depressing and scary.

25722,No worries!
25723,I was just hella confused lol.
25724,Thanks for posting üòä
25725,Exactly... shame on Reuters for poor journalism.
25726,Did he get hit by a car or did he have a reaction to the vaccine or any number of other issues?
25727,"The fact that they didn't pause the trial gives some hope, but this is basically clickbait without more info."
25728,I am curious as to what  constitutes a 2nd/3rd wave vs a peak in the 1st wave?
25729,"I know with the Spanish flu, the 2nd wave was the big killer so people are assuming covid  will act similar with multiple waves."
25730,Hard lockdown is a pipe dream not that it‚Äôs anything more than a temporary fix.
25731,The American economy and supply chain infrastructure can‚Äôt support it.
25732,It would need 6 months warning for a even a 6 week lockdown.
25733,It‚Äôs not simple like flipping a switch and requires massive human capital.
25734,Speaking from the front line we‚Äôre all way understaffed and can‚Äôt find people to show up for an interview further complicating the situation.
25735,Many many of your processed foods require 7 day a week 365 day operations to sustain static demands better yet a lockdown spike.
25736,That‚Äôs right boys and girls the demand for ketchup is so high on a normal day people work on Christmas and thanksgiving to manufacture it‚Äôs empty bottles.
25737,All food additives and ingredients are the same.
25738,Corrugated boxes those things that all your online purchases get delivered in same type of scenario.
25739,There is no way short of being a total self sustaining farm operation that the average American could feed themselves with or without the governments help for a month without leaving home.
25740,Slaughter houses are booked up until Q2 2021 animals are being euthanized as a result.
25741,I work with all the major players that supply your grocery stores (big and small) the hard hard truth is we‚Äôre all slammed with no end up in sight.
25742,The hope is to be caught up in Q1 of 2021 assuming no other disruptions.
25743,The only feasible lockdown is a ‚Äústay at home order‚Äù that lets essential personal go to work but here in the Midwest that‚Äôs easily 50% of the general population.
25744,The only thing that accomplishes is to smite small businesses off the map.
25745,I know I‚Äôll get some comments suggesting we don‚Äôt eat meat or some other solution that would be a long term systemic fix but trust me you need the supply chain even when you think you don‚Äôt.
25746,Yeah that falls in line with most of the other states that I've looked at and what Fauci has been saying.
25747,"Front line and the at risk start getting vaccinated late 2020, early 2021, with the general public starting in Spring and being done by start of Fall 2021."
25748,"I'm still hopeful though that once they start vaccinating the at risk and front line workers, it will help to clamp down on deaths and the spread."
25749,I'm hanging on to the thought that each person we vaccinate means we are that much closer to being done with this from a pandemic level.
25750,Hopefully restrictions and return to normal starts in March or April 2021.
25751,I mean it says he died of the virus.
25752,"If the vaccine isn‚Äôt 100% effective or if he‚Äôs in the placebo, it‚Äôs entirely possible it‚Äôs not vaccine related."
25753,"After the election, regardless of who wins, we will see some big time action on the Covid front."
25754,"I think that most governors are unwilling to do much this close to the election, especially considering how things came down to a few areas of a few states in 2016."
25755,"I think we will see sensible republican governors will clamp down, and all democratic governors clamp down."
25756,Even if Trump wins I don't see an alternative here.
25757,Since the consensus is that we are largely back to normal in 2022 the political harm this could cause with portions of the electorate will be gone.
25758,So naturally that means that DeSantis will figure out a way to mess it up.
25759,Sorry that I have hurt your feelings.
25760,I will delete the comments to please them ;)
25761,"Yep, expecting 400k by the new year if nothing changes."
25762,It‚Äôs so sad right now.
25763,"not only a wild guess, but one firmly and thoroughly debunked, months ago."
25764,"https://www.livescience.com/covid-19-did-not-start-at-wuhan-wet-market.html

right from the start, scientists knew that bats were a likely origin for the virus, and quite a lot of people thought eating exotic animals was part of the problem, although I've literally never heard the ""eaten raw"" part before."
25765,"they thought this because after the 2012 SARS pandemic, scientists tracked _that_ virus down to a virus that had originally spread among bats."
25766,"but they found that out in 2017. it took five years from the pandemic to the research necessary to track down a previous species that had harbored the virus, and there's no actual certainty that it was the only species involved."
25767,"the MERS pandemic (a much smaller pandemic) spread from camels to humans, for example, although it may also have come from bats to camels at some point in the distant past."
25768,"anyway, still in spring, the theory quickly changed to an idea that it had been transmitted from bats to pangolins, and from pangolins to humans via ""wet markets."""
25769,"China allows live animals to be stored in cages on top of each other in these markets, which probably accelerates virus evolution."
25770,"but as early as May, scientists had gone to the wet markets in Wuhan testing animals for the virus and found nothing."
25771,"https://www.livescience.com/covid-19-did-not-start-at-wuhan-wet-market.html

there are also hella conspiracy theories obviously, but the reality is that science takes time, and a lot of people prefer believing nonsense over waiting for the long, dull process that science needs to go through in order to actually find out the truth."
25772,this thing about eating bats raw is definitely part of that.
25773,"even in the few cultures where people do eat bats, which is more Indonesia than China, they cook them first."
25774,I mean that's just ridiculous.
25775,"Bad news, decided to run for office...."
25776,Not good enough!
25777,We needed you yesterday!
25778,"&gt; pre-pandemic hobbies involved outdoor activities (hiking, camping, mountain biking, running, etc.)"
25779,and now it's pretty much impossible to do those things in solitude without running into crowds.
25780,"Even pre-pandemic that's how Colorado has been heading for awhile now, massive influx of people wanting to live here because of those activities."
25781,This is also a double-edge sword as it's good more people are getting out but it's bad because most have no idea about trail/outdoor etiquette and it's placing large amounts of stress on areas that used to be able to handle it.
25782,"Mostly I'm super irritated, and this has been a problem for me for awhile, that people that choose to live in a city such as Denver and willingly drive 4-8 hours one way JUST for a weekend while claiming to be environmentally conscious or living that mountain lifestyle."
25783,They're literally the ones bringing the crowds to otherwise chill areas.
25784,They do this more weekends than not and it's frustrating to see.
25785,This isn't limited just to people who live in cities in Colorado either.
25786,Wilderness is an integral part to the human condition but if you want to live that lifestyle make it as sustainable as possible and don't live in a city.
25787,Live where you recreate.
25788,"The mountain biking scene has been growing over the last few years but of course, covid blew this shit up and people are traveling to destinations previously unknown or infrequently visited."
25789,A lot of these places had more relaxed covid restrictions but that's not possible with the influx of people.
25790,"Moab is a prime example of people from Las Vegas, Salt Lake City and Denver driving MANY hours for a weekend only to be piled on top of each other."
25791,I don't even know where I'm going with this but I'm frustrated with people who chose to live in a city and consistently weekend warrior it.
25792,"I'd like to figure out how to write some sort of thesis about this and find out why, is it social media?"
25793,Is it wanting to get out to find solitude?
25794,I don't know.
25795,My paradise has been paved over in the name of progress and accessibility and I'm jaded.
25796,"Please be aware that Reuters sometimes expand this short storys, so visit maybe the link."
25797,"Article atm:

BRASILIA (Reuters) - Brazilian health authority Anvisa said on Wednesday that a volunteer in a clinical trial of the COVID-19 vaccine developed by AstraZeneca and Oxford University has died, stating it had received data from an investigation into the matter."
25798,"The Federal University of Sao Paulo, which is helping coordinate phase 3 clinical trials in Brazil, separately said that the volunteer was Brazilian."
25799,It‚Äôs irresponsible to publish this because it incites too much speculation.
25800,I'm sure he just had a reaction to the saline placebo...
25801,That wasn‚Äôt their question.
25802,Their question was can you link it?
25803,You speak of California as the French spoke of France before they exploded in cases.
25804,"Every time a high traffic, high volume area attempts to open up after a hard lockdown, they get an influx in cases commensurate to how much they open up."
25805,We'll see how the next few weeks unfold and how your reopening strategy goes.
25806,P.S.
25807,stop sending Texas all these California transplants driving up the housing market!
25808,But do keep sending In-and-Out Burgers.
25809,"Eh, the ""200000 isn't a lot"" only started after Trump and states failed to handle the virus."
25810,"First it was ""Fauci is trying to scare us by saying 200000 could die!!"
25811,"He's inducing panic!!"""

25845,Literally from the article.
25846,What's worse is that our healthcare system is already overloaded.
25847,Hospitals are full and they don't accept new patients.
25848,Doctors are reporting that triage has begin.
25849,"Ambulances with sick people are circling around cities and queueing in front of hospitals, hoping that maybe soon some covid beds will become free."
25850,Dying in process is not that special nowadays.
25851,And due to constantly occupied ambulances if you suddenly become sick no one will come to you and you can't go to hospital because they are locked.
25852,If you somehow manage to connect with our local CDC equivalent (maybe after hour somebody will pick up call).

25873,Stop generalising and putting me in an imaginary group of ‚ÄúSweden strategy supporters‚Äù.
25874,I really don‚Äôt care who told you in March/April that the numbers were exactly correct.
25875,Not my problem that you didn‚Äôt use common sense since it was broadcasted all over the place that the testing capabilities were low.
25876,So what is a wave?
25877,"It‚Äôs not really defined, is it?"
25878,Is it cases?
25879,Is it severe cases/ICUs?
25880,Is it deaths?
25881,"No matter what, Sweden is not (yet) anywhere near the **real** numbers we had in March/April, and a second wave should be similar to the first, don‚Äôt you think?"
25882,And ICU cases are people that **become** seriously sick.
25883,"Before they are admitted, there is really no magic treatment administrated."
25884,The advancements have been for people that are **put in** ICUs.
25885,So ICU admissions is still the gold standard for COVID19 developments.
25886,All depends on hospitalisations and ICU capacity and the actual number of daily deaths.
25887,Whenever one of those crosses the crisis threshold the lockdown will have to be triggered.
25888,Our poor healthcare workers.
25889,I am horrified to think what they go thru.
25890,"Worse yet I stay home for months and months and when I get it, cause we know it will happen, the doctors and nurses will be broken and no one will be well enough to help."
25891,It won‚Äôt matter anyway because there will be no place to go since all the hospitals will have been maxed out for weeks by the end of the Trump Virus.
25892,"Our future is mighty bleak thanks to ‚Äúpresident‚Äù  Trump and his fiercely uneducated, radical un-American Right that refuse to fight for the people of their country simply by wearing a mask."
25893,"A mask that our poor healthcare workers wear everyday, anyway."
25894,"Well, Americans are fucked."
25895,Doesn‚Äôt matter.
25896,Most weren‚Äôt wearing masks anyways.
25897,I could count on both hands and feet how many people I see in Walmart in Utah County that don‚Äôt have a mask on.
25898,I see people on fb groups asking what stores don‚Äôt require masks.
25899,"I even was talking to someone about a job offer the other day and they asked if my company requires masks, when I told them yes, they seemed uninterested."
25900,"It was never a mandate, more so a recommendation."
25901,Unfortunately.

&gt;Leronlimab is a humanized monoclonal antibody that binds CC-chemokine receptor-5 (CCR5), and has undergone extensive clinical testing for the treatment of Human Immunodeficiency Virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection [4-7]

&gt;CCR5 is expressed predominantly on T cells, but also found on macrophages, dendritic cells, and eosinophils, to mediate chemotaxis in response to its cognate ligands..."
25990,These ligands are integral in the recruitment of these immune cells to inflammatory sites.
25991,... [leronlimab]  is therefore a potent inhibitor of CCR5- mediated chemotaxis.
25992,&gt;The immunopathogenesis of COVID-19 likely involves the excessive influx of immune cells into the lung.
25993,"In SARS-CoV-2 infection, activated macrophages in the airways express high levels of CCL3 [ligand of CCR5] with the highest expression seen in patients with critical COVID-19 [13]."
25994,"&gt;Thus it is likely that CCR5- mediated chemotaxis similarly contributes to the excessive lung inflammation seen in COVID-19, and leronlimab has been proposed as an immunomodulatory treatment and tested in a few patients with anecdotal success [prior to this study] [14, 15]."

As the first article points out it wouldn't be the consumption of bat guano in traditional chinese medicine that would be the likely point of infection, but just the collection of it, where workers would be around fresh guano + virions."

26093,"In an ideal scenario, some proportion of those receiving the placebo will get COVID in the following, say, 6 months, while very few, if any, receiving the vaccine will get COVID in those 6 months."
26094,The ratio of infection between vaccine and placebo groups is what's important and you need a lot of volunteers in the study to reduce the random volatility you would otherwise get in the results.
26095,Bear in mind that the ratio can change over time.
26096,So say for 6 months the ratio of infection rates is 3:1 placebo:vaccine.

26196,Not because it was mandated or written in law... Because people could see the bodies piling up and didnt want to be one.
26197,The numbers of total tests and positivity rates are widely available.
26198,If you look at [https://www.covidexitstrategy.org/](https://www.covidexitstrategy.org/) you can see that the majority of U.S. states have increasing positivity rates.
26199,They don't report the 70+ people so you're getting reporting bias.
26200,Every year in the USA a few teenagers and twentysomethings die from influenza and this is worse.

26202,Any source on this to back this up?
26203,The cynic in me says they should not be so public about where they're storing these vaccines because insane conspiracy people might try something there.
26204,I hope they're paying top dollar for really mean security.

26206,&gt; A large portion of people who get a flu vaccine get the flu.
26207,Not relevant to COVID-19.
26208,Flu vaccines lack efficacy due to rapid antigenic drift.
26209,COVID-19 does not undergo rapid antigenic drift.
26210,Efficacy in COVID-19 vaccines will be due to other factors.

26217,"Important to note too that because Covid spreads via superspreaders, the impact of vaccinations might be nonlinear on its ability to spread."
26218,Would love to see math on if.
26219,What if people who though it was safe were allowed to go and people who think it isn't safe were allowed to not go?
26220,Why tf get the vaccine if Death is a possible side effect?
26221,"Social distancing and mask wearing still carries a risk of course, but why risk a vaccine at all?"
26222,Antibodies are shown to only last months anyways.
26223,"Social distancing, you can go several months without getting any disease."
26224,"The risk vs benefit simply doesn‚Äôt seem to be there, just like the flu vaccine."
26225,"Yup, if they aren‚Äôt pausing trials (and they‚Äôve already shown they are willing to pause trials) I don‚Äôt even know why this warrants headlines."

26227,It isn't.
26228,It never is.
26229,I'm looking at possible psychological based angles.

26283,They're also bypassing the feds shipping plan and going directly to states.
26284,That's incredibly smart considering what happened with ppe and testing supplies.
26285,&gt;So you‚Äôre looking at the data from April this year.
26286,Both studies are looking at similar time windows.
26287,"The difference is that your study is only looking at New York city, my study is including data from 14 different states."
26288,And I think the New York situation was extra bad because of the policies regarding senior's homes no?
26289,Or it could be that the New Yorkers were in particularly bad health?
26290,"Or maybe pollution had something to do with the worse outcomes, like in Bergamo Italy."
26291,"Regardless, survival rates have improved dramatically since the springtime, right?"
26292,"So the current situation is undoubtably better than either your New York numbers, or my nationwide numbers."
26293,"It is back of the envelope, I didn‚Äôt hide my assumptions but I‚Äôm curious why you think 70% efficacy is pessimistic granted that‚Äôs the flu vaccine is only 60% effective on any given year even when strains are well matched."
26294,"https://www.cdc.gov/flu/vaccines-work/vaccineeffect.htm

Your second point is contradictory."
26295,You say the reason things are bad now is because of risky behavior and also claim current regulations are unsustainable.
26296,That seems to support my claim that compliance with safety guidelines will deteriorate leading to prolonged duration of the pandemic.
26297,Not sure why you think things will be better in the next year unless we‚Äôre able to get substantially  greater than 50% herd immunity which is outside two standard deviations of what can be expected from any seasonal vaccine.
26298,Those aren‚Äôt the only two options.
26299,You‚Äôre assuming that these measures work.
26300,You‚Äôre also assuming that the benefits outweigh the consequences.
26301,It‚Äôs also hilarious to me that people like you preach compassion and yet you‚Äôre advocating throwing people into prison.

26307,It happened in Australia and I hope other countries come to their senses soon.
26308,Because it's the government demanding that we wear a mask.
26309,Probably the same lives that are now in an ICU
26310,"Funny, I know plenty of people who aren't basement dwellers who are wearing masks because it's the safe and respectful thing to do."

26314,"yes, our ancestors learned over millions years of evolution the necessity of quickly getting rid of antibodies against coronaviruses in their bodies, because coronaviruses have a very cunning trick up in their sleeve - antibody mediated enhancement of infection, this was the major reason why vaccine development against the first SARS and MERS failed, however, you do not have to be scared, the cellular immunity that our bodies develop after being infected with live virus provide protection for life."
26315,"Unfortunately, many vaccines only induce B- cell response, and such immunity is not only short-lived but dangerous in the case of coronaviruses."
26316,"All these facts are well known to the scientific community, but damn, the governments across the globe pore crazy money to make the vaccine, nobody is stupid to stay away from the party."

Oh wait"

26339,etc.
26340,I'd prefer that we just have to show a negative test from within like...48 hours at the gate and then move on for international flights.

26342,"Ive see cases of cats carrying the coronavirus, can dogs?"
26343,"If so, can they transmit it to people?"

26356,"This isn‚Äôt coming from me being selfish, it‚Äôs the fact that many people aren‚Äôt doing it now."
26357,"You're correct that in this type of study, a placebo is the best way to determine if there is an actual effect of the vaccine."
26358,"I was just saying that the term ""double-blind"" has nothing to do with placebo."
26359,"You could, for example, design a study with a placebo and vaccine, where the subject doesn't know which one he got but the researcher does."
26360,"This would be a single-blind study design, still using a placebo."
26361,The double-blind aspect of it is to try to reduce bias.
26362,My (shitty) understanding of the flu vaccine is that it has either live or dead cells of the virus which is supposed to increase your resistance if you get it.
26363,Not necessarily a full immunization.
26364,"Again, my shitty not-a-doctor understanding."
26365,And they‚Äôve since came out and said the two antivirals remdesivir and ??

26516,"A diabetic person's body is either unable to produce insulin or the body's cells are no longer able to use insulin effectively, resulting in elevated blood sugar (or hyperglycemia)."
26517,"(In type I, which is an autoimmune disease, your immune system destroys the cells that produce insulin, so your body won't have any insulin; in type II, insulin resistance develops and your body overproduces insulin to compensate, which creates a spiraling feedback loop until your body's insulin no longer works)."

27073,&gt;The point is that each of the 210+k people who died suffered and died needlessly.
27074,"You wouldn‚Äôt be so callous about the probabilities if it was your family member dying, that much is sure."
27075,"The majority died early on, since there have been extra precautions in nursing and group homes that is tapered off."

27077,The virus doesn‚Äôt discriminate.
27078,You seem to be under the impression that we can stop or wipe out the virus.
27079,"We cannot especially in a country as big as this and even then it only delays infection, it doesn't stop it."
27080,"&gt;In addition to that, we still don‚Äôt know the long term effects of even the mildest of cases, especially permanent lung, heart, and other organ damage."
27081,So far its low probability and those same symptoms happen in other diseases as well.
27082,This isn't exactly unheard of or higher than we'd expect.
27083,Acting like it's some big unknown looming threat is not a fair assessment.

27093,Ireland had to lockdown.
27094,The health system was starting to get overwhelmed.
27095,People with cancer were dying because their treatments had to be postponed.
27096,Vital medical appointments were being cancelled.
27097,This has nothing to do with the death rate being high or low and everything to do with the health system needing to reset before winter and the contact tracing system needing time to get on top of things.
27098,ICUs were filling up the the point that it was a real risk that car crash victims or cardiac arrest patients wouldn't have beds.

27114,I remember exactly when it started because of being so self conscious.
27115,Yep 4 weeks and counting now (oh and thats with weekly Covid tests: all negative) and tons of dirty looks.
27116,So far the CDC has 5700 deaths in that age group involving COVID (their words).
27117,"All deaths for all causes in that age group stand at 117,748 this year so far."
27118,"Looking at a random year, 2017, has that group as 137,000."

27159,The only evidence I have that you can still get vaccinated is your anecdotal evidence.
27160,The [CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/smallpox/vaccine-basics/who-gets-vaccination.html) even says it's only available to scientists who work directly with it.
27161,Trumps treatment was estimated to be in the 100s of thousands if paying out of pocket.
27162,We eliminated rinderpest also.
27163,"Granted, that doesn't infect people."
27164,"Well, we're already open as much as we can be."

27184,"I don't see why it should ""work"" for others when we're waiting years, probably decades, to make the move."
27185,"Sanctuary cities unfortunately exist here, too, and meanwhile people in need who are legitimate Canadian residents have waiting times to access basic city services."
27186,It's disgusting.

27212,Why does this corner feel like a NASCAR track on the first lap of a 500 mile race?
27213,"Agreed, but if there was zero threat we wouldn't vaccinate anyone for it."
27214,"Even with the improvements, Covid still has a much much higher death rate than the flu."
27215,This is good news but not reason to get lax.
27216,There's also the caveat that the improvements are due to medical practitioners getting better at treating Covid - but if hospitals get overwhelmed well that doesn't apply anymore
27217,It's a good experiment to try on a smallish population.

27225,Lots of addicts were unable to get to group or 1-on-1 during the lockdown.
27226,There were ways to access group or 1-on-1 by video but that doesn't work well as there needs to be in person with eye contact.
27227,The most likely to overdose are the ones who were very heavy users of whatever alcohol or drug.
27228,Then they stop for a long time.
27229,But when they start back up they don't start at the beginning.
27230,They start where they left off - and then comes the overdoses.
27231,Is it me you're looking for?
27232,"This, coming from the same guy that said we should pack the football stadium the same week that the game was cancelled due to an outbreak."
27233,Of course it's not the restrictions or lockdowns causing this!!!

27242,"The 300,000 excess deaths is from a recent CDC report based on documented deaths (not an estimate for this year) and 2/3 of the extra deaths are accounted for in our covid death toll."
27243,Also drug laws in the US aren‚Äôt enacted to prevent people from dying of drug overdoses.
27244,That‚Äôs what treatment programs are for.
27245,They‚Äôre enacted because of voters‚Äô concerns about having people addicted to drugs on their streets out of an often at least partially racially motivated fear that they‚Äôll bring crime.

27292,Here's the thing: COVID is in a sweet spot.
27293,It won't kill over 90% of the people who get it.
27294,So it can spread really easily.
27295,But it's far deadlier than the flu and other 'oh it will pass' viruses.

27376,"That‚Äôs the great thing about facts, it doesn‚Äôt matter whether or not you agree with them, they‚Äôre still true."
27377,There is no intermediate choice of leaving some restrictions.
27378,Some restrictions kill industries that cannot adjust on any reasonable time frame.
27379,"Social distancing when the pandemic ends must go away or you may as well sign the entertainment industries death certificate

27381,"As for the other 99% of the world, we don't have to change vital parts of our normal world to accommodate you when the pandemic ends."
27382,The reason that the govt are locking down the country isn't to stop people from getting Covid - it's impossible not to get.
27383,It's to stop the NHS hospitals they've pillaged gor the last 20 years or more from becoming overwhelmed to the point of collapse.
27384,Incidence is much higher than 100.
27385,"But look at NRW, with 17 million people and higher population density than Netherlands."
27386,It is almost completely red on covid maps now.
27387,"Why could it have ""never originated from the WIV""?"

27389,Can you provide any evidence for this claim?
27390,Wrong sub OP.
27391,The anti mask fucktards who think this pandemic is a conspiracy like to congregate elsewhere.
27392,"If they stuck to the first idea that was brought up - keep high school and middle school students remote, and using their classrooms/facilities to spread out elementary school students out - most folks probably would have gotten behind that idea..."
27393,"...Instead we got a plan/layout that was designed to fail (hybrid program) that encourages families to put their kids back into the classroom, and further penalizes the families that do not..."
27394,We didn't get anywhere close to either thanks to Trump's failure.
27395,Its annoying to breathe through and have to carry around.

27409,"Most will survive though, that is fact with IFR lower than 1 percent."

27411,"So if all that detailed list remains open, other than a KO to any business not lucky enough to be in/on that rather big category list, how will the ‚Äúlockdown‚Äù slow down the COVID?"
27412,Gov Ducey in AZ did (and still does) the same thing.
27413,He didn't even let cities &amp; counties issue a mask mandate on their own until late July.
27414,"If Maricopa County rescinds their mandate (which I don't think they will), we'd really be hosed."

27426,The primary question to answer is always: Who benefits?
27427,The answer is this case is almost no one.
27428,The decision makers in governments around the world don't want to see their economies tank; presiding over a tanking economy is the surest way to get voted out of power.
27429,So everyone in power all over the world is lying to everyone just so they can fuck themselves over.
27430,Nothing like highlighting your ignorance for the whole country to see.
27431,I wonder how health care professionals have survived all these years breathing in all that carbon dioxide.
27432,Not to mention the ones who now care for COVID patients and have to wear N95 masks for 12 or more hours a day.
27433,"Not only that but you

- dont need everyone vaccinated to stop the spread
- children won‚Äôt be able to get it at first
- depending on vaccine efficacy, if very high then individuals who get it can feel confident in their protection without herd immunity"

27449,"Meanwhile, Central and Eastern Europe still recovers from WWII + communist economy + collapse of said economy."
27450,Comparing US to CEE countries is very apples-to-oranges.
27451,The US system is not looking good in general or especially in outcome per dollar.
27452,"There is some leading edge in more advanced surgery and drugs being available sooner, yes."
27453,But that's it.
27454,The hospitals are worse than average.
27455,"You get that excellent quadruple bypass done, but then die in the night because of ""cost savings"" on nurses."
27456,"And the worst part/biggest difference is high disease burden - there is little prevention/prophylaxis to speak of, people do not want to spend money so they wait to get really sick then go to the ER."
27457,"Even with insurance, there is a risk that they will deny claims."
27458,So you wait and things get worse.
27459,It is not really **health**care if it fosters sickness so much.
27460,"Life is completely normal for me, with the exception of wearing a mask in public areas."
27461,"Coming from a journalist that usually does travel and culture, this means absolutely nothing."

27476,"In the winter, when most US states are cold and the humidity drops very low, it will be a different story."
27477,"Respiratory droplets travel farther in low humidity, it's why cold and flu season is real."
27478,The graph of cases rising throughout multiple countries in the northern hemisphere is likely heavily influenced by the temperature (and therefore relative humidity).

27527,lol the EU is way more out of control than Canada.

27531,My sister is on a student visa and needs to come here( US) in 28 hour long journey next semester.
27532,We are all worried about it.
27533,The majority of the Italian population arrives in April  safe and sound just in time for the vaccine program to start.
27534,By the looks of things in the future you could count those who didn't get infected on one hand
27535,"There's [no evidence](https://www.fda.gov/food/food-safety-during-emergencies/food-safety-and-coronavirus-disease-2019-covid-19) to support the idea of COVID spreading through food, and COVID doesn't last for more than a few hours on most surfaces."
27536,The evidence we have so far shows that COVID-19 spreads through people through breath droplets in the air.
27537,"And travel restrictions, PCR tests and mandatory quarantine can prevent that from infecting a country."
27538,We've already seen it working in those countries.
27539,crying from the united states :)
27540,The issue is not the schools themselves but the behavior of families and activities they perform outside of school which makes them likely to be infected and then they go to school.
27541,Sadly those sort of families are the ones who chose to return in person vs staying remote and their behavior may cause entire schools or districts to close/reopen on a 2 week intermittent basis because every 2 positives per classroom is considered outbreak where I am.
27542,"So far one HS and one MS are on a 2 weeks quarantine, we went back in person less than 3 weeks ago."
27543,"Half of elementary schools in the district have at least 1 case (the whole classroom quarantines when that happens) some have 2, a third within 2 weeks would mean the entire school would have to go on a 2 week quarantine."
27544,So far my kids school has only had one incident of positive and we are approaching 10 days since it was reported.
27545,"I only sent back my daughter who is in 1st grade because she has an IEP and remote was terrible for her, my son in 4th grade is staying remote at least til end of second trimester."
27546,"He does okay for most part but should a case happen in his class it would mean his sister would have to quarantine even if it doesn't happen in close contact to her, so I increase chances she stays in person for as long as possible."
27547,Our district is being super careful and the 15 cases recorded all over district are definitely not being infections while in school.
27548,A minority may ruin it for the rest of the kids or children like my daughter.
27549,At this point I am taking every day she gets to attend as a bonus as a district wide closing for a certain number of weeks is looming above our heads as cases are increasing in our county...
27550,Hmm I wonder if this coincides the decision to force adults and young adults/children into confined spaces for hours at a time on a daily basis before releasing them back into the public.
27551,Meh that's fine.
27552,My family and I will get the vaccine.

27560,"It is not better in Sweden, though, or Netherlands who had more loose restrictions that went very well during summer."

27575,That's the conspiracy theory my brother believes.
27576,But it falls apart quickly if you take a look at the overall death rates year after year.
27577,I heard it'd be gone by Easter though.
27578,"As you point out, it's not that binary."
27579,"Infected/not-infected is, but most vaccines reduce severity in patients that are still infected."
27580,So you're right that you may be more likely to have a mild case even if you are infected.
27581,"That type of data will be included in the clinical data and regulatory filing, so we can all be much more informed prior to actually getting vaccinated."
27582,So you are German and go skiing in Czech Republic?
27583,I would love to know why is that!
27584,I basically always wanted to ask someone like you :) Because I am Czech and I have been skiing in my country like 5 times in my life.
27585,"Once I tried skiing in Austria, I saw no reason to do otherwise, except for maybe a single-day outing, because the costs are similar, but the density of people at the slope is about an order of magnitude less and everything is bigger and more interesting."
27586,So what is it you like in Czech mountains?
27587,Pfizer is a giant AMERICAN company.

27595,The only thing that will make it go away is a RELIABLE and TRUSTWORTHY vaccine that is past the manufacturing process and widely available.
27596,We ain't there yet.
27597,We're not even close.
27598,"Even if a viable vaccine is announced, it will take months more to develop and distribute."
27599,"A reliable country discovering and approving a vaccine isn't the end, it's a sign that the end is 3-6 months away."
27600,The other reason is that they're in partnership with a German company: BioNTech.
27601,BioNTech developed the vaccine and Pfizer accelerated the living hell out of it with a ton of resources.
27602,"The Germans are getting their cut as a result, and probably the rest of the EU too."

27619,"Mandates don't equal compliance, and I'm not sure if you live here or not, but compliance with mask wearing is shoddy at best."
27620,"Standing outside now, where masks are mandatory, I'd say max 30% compliance just glancing around, looking into a shop with two employees with masks around their chin."
27621,"Basically, you have absolutely no grounds to assert anything about the effectiveness of masks based on mandates issued in the Czech Republic not having had a measurable effect."
27622,ELI5...why won't lockdowns work?

27633,"Brushing off new information, or even the pursuit of new information, to say ""either way, I still think it's silly"" is absolutely digging your heels in."
27634,Imagine I'm lobbing some beach balls at you.

27662,Italians are famous for considering laws to be suggestions.
27663,"So, when they were in strict lockdown to knock down transmission ASAP, there were fines and jail sentences attached to violating the rules."
27664,"As an example, one rule was that if you went to the grocery store, (only grocers and pharmacies were open at that time) and didn‚Äôt buy groceries, you could be fined."
27665,"At a store my daughter frequents, there are also clothes, electronics, etc."
27666,"Some guy went there, bought a gaming system and nothing else."
27667,He was fined more than the cost of the system.
27668,"Honestly, he could have bought a loaf of bread, too, and been OK."
27669,"But he, like so many Americans, decided that the law didn‚Äôt apply to his special self."
27670,Most people aren't social distancing anymore.
27671,It's extremely awkward and difficult to maintain.
27672,"That being said, people are still generally respectful towards pandemic guidelines where I live."
27673,Mask compliance is very high and people generally also avoid crowding.
27674,Life is pretty normal otherwise.
27675,Too late methinks.
27676,Most compliance seems to be voluntary right now.
27677,"When you go to the grocery store, there's an expectation that you wear a mask and maintain your distance."
27678,It's a social pressure.
27679,"Yes, it's technically the law in most places, but the police aren't standing around everywhere handing out tickets to people."
27680,The restrictions aren't really legally enforced.
27681,I think it'll mostly come down to the policies of businesses and other public spaces.
27682,"If they choose to keep things going through 2021, well there's nothing anyone can do about that."
27683,You'll have to comply or get kicked out.
27684,"But if not, I think you'll see people taking off their masks once they get vaccinated, unless there's some kind of enormous social pressure that persists beyond that."
27685,"considering that all of the 58 passengers most likely did not yet know they were infected while on the flights, this is impressive and encouraging."
27686,Did they go to the plane bathroom during flight?
27687,How many people sincerely keep their masks on when alone in the airplane bathroom?
27688,how quickly is the air in the bathroom ventilated ...?
27689,the studies so far can only consider infected passengers.
27690,"But the infection vectors are not the passengers, it is the stewards/stewardesses."
27691,"They are walking around, pushing carts, breathing deeply and talking."
27692,and talking.
27693,and talking.
27694,"What about plain boarding and unboarding, are ventilators on then also?"
27695,How often is everyone in the plane crew tested?
27696,daily?
27697,with every arrival?
27698,"Since crew members have the highest chances of being infected and becoming infection vectors, they should be wearing FFP2 or FFP3 filtering masks, to minimize the risk."
27699,It is not sufficient that some of team crew be tested regularly.
27700,All crew members have to be tested daily to avoid the bad luck of false negative results.
27701,"Reason: the false negative rate is at best on average 20%

27707,The virus could never have originated from the WIV.
27708,It could only have originated from a wild coronavirus.
27709,"There's a tiny probability that a wild sample was brought to the WIV and then escaped, but that's so incredibly unlikely given the prevalence of wild betacoronavirii in the first place that it's practically sensible to ignore."

27713,And the unfortunate reality is that we are already seeing a rate of new cases per day that hasn't been seen since the PEAK in July/summer.
27714,"That's not a good sign, because this wave still feels early."
27715,Keep in mind that they will likely give priority to high-risk groups to get it first and that will reduce deaths MASSIVELY and then the virus won't be as dangerous as it was pre-vaccination.
27716,"That will help a ton with easing many restrictions for sure, and it won't require 7+ billion people to be vaccinated."
27717,Children with no health conditions might be last in line to get vaccinated if they ever do.

- working two different jobs full time that includes travel

- spending time with friends, usually three nights a week

## Abstract

&amp;#x200B;

As the world‚Äôs economies come out of the lockdown imposed by the COVID-19 pandemic, there is an urgent need for technologies to mitigate COVID-19 transmission in confined spaces such as buildings."
27858,"This feasibility study looks at one such technology, upper-room ultraviolet (UV) air disinfection, that can be safely used while humans are present in the room space, and which has already proven its efficacy as an intervention to inhibit the transmission of airborne diseases such as measles and tuberculosis."
27859,"Using published data from various sources, it is shown that the SARS-CoV-2 virus, the causative agent of COVID-19, is highly likely to be susceptible to UV-C damage when suspended in air, with a UV susceptibility constant likely to be in the region 0.377‚Äì0.590 m2/J, similar to that for other aerosolised coronaviruses."
27860,"As such, the UV-C flux required to disinfect the virus is expected to be acceptable and safe for upper-room applications."
27861,"Through analysis of expected and worst-case scenarios, the efficacy of the upper-room UV-C approach for reducing COVID-19 transmission in confined spaces (with moderate but sufficient ceiling height) is demonstrated."
27862,"Furthermore, it is shown that with SARS-CoV-2, it should be possible to achieve high equivalent air change rates using upper-room UV air disinfection, suggesting that the technology might be particularly applicable to poorly ventilated spaces."
27863,If you want everything open then convince the anti-science crew to do their part.
27864,Until then we have to lockdown if people can‚Äôt follow simple rules.
27865,Also I live in one of the states that has the toughest lockdowns and you were still pretty much free to do most things.
27866,"I had a great summer enjoying outdoor festivals, visiting breweries, hiking, biking, camping trips, porch parties, eating out, etc.... What is so limited about a lockdown in your mind?"
27867,Movies?
27868,Concerts?
27869,"Question: I‚Äôve got some family members sharing reports of ‚Äúpeople testing positive, without ever taking the test‚Äù when leaving a testing center after signing up."
27870,"Seems super tin foil hat, pants on head, conspiracy theory-ish."
27871,"Is there anything too this, ive seen like 3 articles that have talked about it but nothing more than anecdotal accounts."
27872,Could someone point me to a good article or summary of how this is either true/false/whatever.
27873,My phone usage hasn't changed at all.
27874,My internet usage has increased drastically.
27875,Before I probably used 10 perfect of my monthly limit.
27876,Now it is sometimes 40 percent.
27877,Now?!?!
27878,Holy shit.
27879,Yeah because it totally doesn't affect the chances of a long term effective vaccine in a timely manner..
27880,Trump is playing 4d chess.. it's  all gonna work out great!

&gt;The Daily Beast published a new report that suggests Walt Disney World is ‚Äúcovering up‚Äù and underreporting its COVID-19 cases among workers and cast members."
27882,"&gt;  
&gt;Workers and their spouses told The Daily Beast that Disney is allowing people who tested positive for the novel coronavirus to return to work despite the dangers and risks it represents."
27883,"&gt;  
&gt; The report includes a number of accounts from employees ‚Äî who spoke under anonymity out of fear of losing their jobs ‚Äî who talked about how the park has kept COVID-19 numbers under wraps."

27887,This isn't fair.
27888,The old world plagues absolutely disseminated the populations of that time.
27889,Like 45% to 60% of everyone alive died as a result of the Black Death.
27890,The losses from these plagues are incomphrensiable to us today.
27891,In March people thought the fatality rate of COVID was 4%.
27892,"Even if it was 4%, it still wouldn't be able to hold a candle to the real plague."
27893,I agree to an extent.
27894,What I don‚Äôt know is the number of people who get those effects.
27895,Another point is that restrictions should be INFLUENCED by science and not based entirely off science.
27896,Sweeping policies that effect every aspect of life have more than just health implications.
27897,Corona is just one factor.
27898,"Other factors include the economy, mental health, risk tolerance, the inherent value of certain freedoms, and even things such as domestic violence."

27933,"However, it's also self evident that a lockdown cannot persist indefinitely."
27934,"That would destroy the economy, ruin an enormous number of lives, and create hardships that would last for generations."
27935,The answer was never to lockdown indefinitely.
27936,"Let me be clear, this is an **intentionally misconstrued straw man** that the right has fabricated in order to make COVID prevention measures seem entirely untenable."
27937,"The answer was always an initial lockdown during a spike to halt the spread, the greater the breadth of the lockdown, the better the result."
27938,"And after several weeks of drastically reduced transmission, coming out the other end with a high percentage of mask use among the public + common sense social distancing (standing 6ft apart while on line at the supermarket for example)."
27939,I haven't seen anyone realistically propose an indefinite lockdown.
27940,That's a talking point meant to create opposition to all COVID prevention measures.
27941,"If the public wore masks in greater numbers and correctly (not as chin straps), coming out of the lockdowns we would have been in significantly better shape."
27942,"Unfortunately, all of the US countermeasures have been thoroughly half assed due to baffling political and ideological opposition."

28039,"Last week my moms best friend, who is anti-mask, shared a news story that claimed that covid is less deadly because 1500 people died from flu last year in Czech Republic and at the time ""only"" 1100 were dead from covid."
28040,Within a single week we managed to get to 1700 dead.
28041,Some people seriously need to open their eyes.
28042,I would be happy if it was 4 weeks considering how fast the cases are rising.
28043,&gt;As for the ICU / Deaths... one problem with your argument... it doesn't take account of the dramatic improvements in treatments that have occurred since March/April.
28044,Improvments in hospital treatments?
28045,"If that was true wouldn't that still mean that hospitals would still be full, people would just not be dying?"

28053,"&gt; it should not matter much that it's not mandated outdoors

Crowded bus stops, train terminals, markets, all OK without masks."
28054,Also not having it mandatory outdoors just means that people don't even have masks with them and maybe just pull them out inside a shop.
28055,&gt; what would be the solution?
28056,For example what germany had the whole summer - mask on except when seated.
28057,It's a simple distinction.
28058,&gt; But you can't solve those just with masks.
28059,"Probably, but we don't know that."

28075,"But given that, for example, people don‚Äôt put on their masks to go to the restroom, and don‚Äôt bother to socially distance, a lot of restaurants are investing in propane heaters, lap robes and roofs over their patties to keep people coming in."
28076,It really is difficult.
28077,I chose not to live on campus this year because of covid and it‚Äôs even worse.
28078,I‚Äôm stuck in my house with my parents all day every day without being able to make friends.
28079,"I‚Äôm fortunate enough to have a couple friends I talk to regularly, but I can‚Äôt make new ones."
28080,"It‚Äôs also really difficult because there‚Äôs some people I know that blatantly disregard the safety protocols (and when asked they say they‚Äôre ‚Äúbeing careful‚Äù but they‚Äôre really not) because of cultural differences, and I can‚Äôt help but be envious for them at this point."
28081,They‚Äôre being stupid and going out and making friends with other stupid people who are the ones making the virus last as long as it is.
28082,"One person even said they were in isolation for 2 weeks because one of their FIVE roommates got covid, and the day they were able to leave they were back on the streets spreading god knows how much."
28083,"Despite all of that, I still envy them for even making friends."
28084,"It‚Äôs a battle with depression every day because I feel like I‚Äôm not good enough to make friends in college even though I know it‚Äôs not true, I‚Äôm just following safety guidelines."

28110,"It most certainly can kill anyone, but for young, healthy adults, the difference between covid and the flu is near non-existent."
28111,People have to live.
28112,People need social interaction and some normality for mental health.
28113,Condemning people for doing what‚Äôs allowed by the government is pushing responsibility onto people and away from governments who mismanaged the situation.
28114,Lock downs aren‚Äôt a sustainable solution and cause many other deaths outside of COVID.

28328,The virus is very infectious and it is unlikely first generation vaccines will be effective enough to prevent an epidemic even if 100% of the population were vaccinated.
28329,"Secret agent of the CCP, I presume?"
28330,Training.
28331,It takes time to train a dog to pay attention to the smell you want to find rather than the smells it is interested in and there are few firms that do it.
28332,It is not a thing we can instantly do.

28346,Don't waste a vaccine if you're going to be reckless before you're fully protected
28347,&gt; This sounds like an amazingly useful test.
28348,It doesn't do much beyond the current PCR test.
28349,"What's really inexplicable about the current PCR tests is that the labs don't report the cycle threshold, which is the proxy for viral load."
28350,"That viral load is what this new test reports, even though similar data is already available with today's PCR test and simply not used... for some reason."
28351,"This test does distinguish between replication-competent virus and RNA fragments that can't infect, but that doesn't really add much because high viral loads will correspond to replication-competent virus that is infectious and vice versa."
28352,"In other words, the viral load is really what's important in determining infectiousness."
28353,"If your viral load is small, it doesn't matter if it's replication-competent or not because you can't infect other people with viral loads that low *even if* it's all replication-competent."
28354,"tl;dr This test doesn't add much beyond what PCR testing *already does,* but for some reason labs around the world don't report the viral load estimate for PCR testing based on the cycle threshold of detection."
28355,Placebos exist in all trials.
28356,The point of them is to act as a control (think high school science with writing experimental designs).
28357,"You need to compare your results to something to see if the thing being tested, in this case the vaccine, produced different results than the absence of the vaccine."
