31,People are just tired of hearing “should we be worried about the X variant??

&gt;Progress is being made on all three fronts:  
· In the next month, Beigel expects results from studies of people who got sick despite being vaccinated in clinical trials, findings that could help establish an immunity baseline — what scientists call a “correlate of protection.” Those studies could help researchers establish a threshold — such as a minimum antibody level — that signals whether someone is immune or whether that person has become vulnerable to infection."
147,"· Scientists are analyzing blood samples from the first people who were vaccinated a year ago in trials, hoping to determine whether antibodies continue to stick around or if they vanish."
148,"Earlier research found that the disease fighters remain at robust levels for at least six months following Moderna vaccination, although variants can complicate that, with antibody protection that fades faster."
149,"A recent Nature study found that antibodies do decline after people recover from infection, but they don’t keep plummeting — they plateau and persist nearly a year later."
150,"· The clinical trial being launched by NIAID will systematically test whether people who received one brand of vaccine in January — a single shot of Johnson &amp; Johnson, two shots of the Moderna vaccine or two shots of Pfizer-BioNTech — ***need to get the same brand of vaccine, or whether there might be benefits to mixing and matching."
151,***
152,How can you dismiss lab leak theory?
153,Yep.
154,He does this instead of working on plans to incentivize vaccination
155,Pfizer and Moderna are exporting doses that other countries per purchase contracts.
156,The 80 million are US donated doses separate from that.
157,Curious how much of the 111 million from EU will/was donated?
158,"After my first shot I had a sore arm, try to keep it moving to prevent it from getting too stiff."
159,"After my second, I got pretty tired about 4 hours after the shot, went to sleep, and when I woke up 8 hours later I felt like I had the flu."
160,"48 hours after my second shot I was back to normal, but from what I've seen 48 hours is on the longer end of the spectrum for duration of side effects."
161,Most people seem to be rid of their side effects sooner than that.

181,"Sure you could lie and say you are vaccinated if you arent...but we all know that after working 40 hours a week with someone for months or years, they eventually tell at least one coworker pretty much every detail of their life."
182,I know the vaccine status of almost every single one of my co workers and their opinion of the vaccine....we all just arent good at minding out own business and keeping out mouths shut.
183,The kind of person that would lie about having the vaccine is also the kind of person who has likely spent months not shutting up about not wanting the vaccine.
184,"I remember a theory a while ago that under 1's were likely still at high risk, but generally get it less because new parents are more cautious overall."
185,Possible that could hold some weight.

195,After many years of this people no longer live in the same shared reality based on a set of accepted facts.
196,Its only going to get worse too.
197,That’s not what the lab origin theory is suggesting.
198,"The theory is just that the crossover event might have happened in a lab, or a lab studying the virus might have accidentally contributed to further spreading the virus."
199,I doubt anyone will ever know the real reason and frankly it barely even matters.
200,"Almost every single government bungled at least one aspect of the response in varying degrees, and whether lab breaches or animal reservoirs this sort of thing has happened before and will happen again."
201,The questions are how to mitigate and best practices to prevent—trying to find a smoking gun is a red herring for cynical geopolitical gain
202,My first shot wasn’t bad; just a mild headache and sore arm.
203,"The second shot gave me a pounding headache, a fever, and a full-body ache kind of like a mild sunburn."
204,"It was not fun, but Tylenol helped and it was completely gone within 48 hours."
205,"It was worth it to get vaccinated, though."
206,"We keep hearing of incidents like this where people are trying to stop people from exercising their personal rights, mostly in a violent way."
207,"I'd love to know WHY people seem to think that they can force people, through acts of terrorism, to fear the vaccine or the treatment."
208,Somethings behind it all.
209,Sore arm.

287,I really do not think you have to be anxious - the vaccines from Biontech/Pfizer and Moderna work astonishingly well and will protect you in my opinion even against the variants.
288,The likelihood that you will catch it and get severely ill is very slim.
289,But you are absolutely right - the vaccine can fail and it is very unlikely that it will fail twice if you meet someone who is although vaccinated in contrast to meeting someone who isn’t.
290,Especially older people or people who are at risk of getting a severe cases should encourage everybody they come in contact with to get the vaccine.
291,Here in Germany vaccinated residents of an elderly home died because of some workers who refused the vaccine.
292,To your plumber: there will be no herd immunity.
293,The virus will circulate and become endemic because of the variants and the virus in the throat of vaccinated or unvaccinated people.
294,We all will very likely come into contact with the virus in the coming years - you are either vaccinated and your immune system knows what’s coming or you aren’t and roll the dice with covid.

315,"Idea is to have strict quarantine, but when that fails we need to act quickly and with extreme prejudice to stop the spread."
316,Australia has only vaccinated just over 1% of it's population which means we're in no state to take chances.
317,"If it sets your mind at ease, the source of the fertility rumor is really easily debunked."

322,"It was somebody with an agenda just spitballing about possible bad things they thought *could* happen, with no evidence, and it was not supported by any actual facts."
323,American currently living in Australia.
324,It’s a combination of slow roll-out and the Australian citizens don’t want it.
325,"They are happy to keep the borders closed, and see no reason to rush get it."
326,It’s infuriating.
327,The anti vax movement has really settled in here.
328,Vague news headlines and reports of side effects hasn’t helped.
329,I wish people realized that everything has side effects.

337,"Also, tell a bunch of aussies to have a week off, we’ll take it."
338,I thought 1 dose of the mRNA vaccines gave you about 85-90% protection after 3-4 weeks.
339,Could be india?
340,Love this article.
341,"Infections down 50% from start of may, we’ve not seen this since June 2020…."
342,So we’re doing as good as we were last year.

349,"At the same time, if it gets more people vaccinated, that's some pretty cheap public health returns for the cost."
350,"Definitely worth doing, even if ir feels like it shouldn't be necessary."
351,Moderna was shown to have 90% efficacy and Pfizer 85% after the first shot.
352,The 2nd shot is mostly for protection longevity.

366,Not an excuse to spread a deadly virus.
367,"The Olympics are just a show, something started by countries to show off their national pride, its no different than any other sport in the sense that it doesn't matter, it's useless, pointless, just another way for a country/people to wave their dick around like ""ohhhh look at me I'm special""

""It's a once in a lifetime chance"" so what?"
368,Spreading the virus and getting a ton of people killed so you can win a medal for a pointless competition?
369,People's lives are at stake here.
370,How does anyone justify events that literally have no real purpose for society other than showing off and getting medals that ultimately don't matter other than for temporary sponsorships to make money until the next event 4 years later?
371,"&gt;no government support is available 

This is the real issue."
372,Lockdowns are a capable solution as long as the government offers support.
373,Depends which vaccine.
374,Aren’t the mRNA ones much higher?
375,"You will never be really 100% protected and safe from infecting others, but one shot significantly lowers the risk of transmitting the virus if you do get it, and obviously the second shot will help even more once you get it."
376,"In the end, you need to do a risk assessment as with all other things in life."
377,"Unless you live in a place with very high community spread, I would say that the risk is definitely low enough."
378,It definitely has the “what’s in it for me?” feel rather than the vaccine is beneficial to me and the rest of society.
379,Exactly.
380,Contamination in non-vaxxed communities have to be expected next autumn.
381,"If natural immunity stays strong even with the new variants, things can settle down quickly."
382,"If not, it's gonna take a bit longer."
383,I see this is getting the same response as AZ did.

408,There was someone that posted a large collection of scientific articles and news sources that could point to a lab leak earlier.
409,"They got good reception here, because their conclusions weren’t knee-jerk, and they had academic sources."
410,"So they could do it, but they couldn't be bothered (as a previous commenter noted)"
411,Bleeping idiots.
412,I agree.
413,"If you're sick, and can't stay home, mask up for others."
414,Been doing that in Asia for decades.

417,Two different uses.

422,This is just stupid.
423,"Signing an NDA to get a price quote, sounds like a very normal process with all vaccines, according to the article, just go ahead do it."

How many times do people need to be told this?"
426,"Companies will not just give other countries the methods for creating their vaccines, that is a massive liability, no company is going to allow another country to produce their vaccine without that country being held to the very same standards they are held to here in USA."
427,"Thus means facilities and staff, months and months of twsting/trials, its insane how much time, work, effort is required to make this happen."
428,It is actually cheaper and faster if other countries just buy the vaccine from the companies here in USA.
429,These companies aren't just going to give the production of their vaccines out to random foreign countries purely because if they fuck up the vaccine and it starts causing deaths or other major side effects it could completely botch the entire idea of using vaccines and they won't want to be held liable for shitty vaccine production.
430,"It takes times for these things to be done, if another country wants to do it, getting a production process setup and operational could take years...."
431,My partner works in age care and they are only now starting to get it done.
432,They are way way behind.
433,"With numbers like that, a lot of people won’t and don’t find AZ appealing."
434,I much rather not catch covid at all.
435,"Once vaccines are much more available, AZ will probably be dropped."
436,Not enough government heavy-handedness according to this guy
437,I struggle to put those arguments in a light that seems better than anti-vax I guess.
438,"I know it’s not you and I’m not arguing with you here but to me it’s just….. everyone who gets infected represents a chance for mutations that put *everyone* back at square one, or worse."
439,I just can’t see the argument that “people my age aren’t dying as much” really feels any better than conspiracy theories?
440,"Plus, “low risk demo” doesn’t mean as much as the stats on people dying at those younger ages are adding up now too."
441,Why can’t people simply acknowledge that living together brings responsibility with it.
442,We owe it to each other to not be so insular as to risk everyone else’s health and lives.
443,And even ~600k deaths won’t make some of us stand tall.
444,"We may have to incentivize people to not be selfish, clearly, but we don’t have to like that we had to do it."
445,"Absolutely dreadful, we’ll be lucky to have a substantial amount of Pfizer by the end of the year."
446,Only 4 million out of our 25 million have had at least 1 dose
447,The number is approaching to 1 in 50 thousands.
448,"Yes, 20x higher."

450,[removed]
451,"That would be good, but why are we vaccinating them before the general population though?"
452,Are the Olympics even worth the trouble considering no international guests can enter the country and about 5 to 6% of the people have only a single dose of the vaccine?
453,But it keeps happening...?
454,"This year, at my wife's school (FL, all in person learning), the parents were finally doing this (in the past when kids woke up with a fever they'd give them Tylenol and send them to school anyways)."
455,Hopefully they continue the new pattern.
456,Only 12 students got covid-19 (none were believed to come from school transmission) from a school of over 300 students.
457,"It's fine as long as people don't undermine it, and then it will be over quickly."

462,"But some people kind of conflate it with “likes” on other social media, forgetting that Reddit was primarily designed as a news aggregator, and not, say, Instagram."
463,We really need to get to the bottom of this.
464,Who was at fault and was it intentional?
465,So many have lost their loved ones.
466,Someone will have to pay for this if it was intentional.

468,Yes.
469,Stop it aggressively NOW.
470,Stop it.
471,Don't bend the knee to the virus by giving it hosts.
472,Stop the damned lingering.
473,"Don't see why not it's a simple to follow leaflet and there is a lot of curiosity around potential side effects among the public, quite common for people to discuss if they did or did not have any symptoms after their jab, etc."
474,I really think this is it.
475,The people I know who didn’t necessarily had COVID but knew someone who had it or had it bad were more eager to get it than others.
476,I know a few people who no one near them caught it… and they think this is overblown by the media.
477,They aren't operating because the government has mandated them not to.
478,And it's not few closures.
479,It's literally most shops.
480,Look at Burke St.
481,It's a ghost town.
482,But I guess only a few shops are shut.
483,Never said i want a haircut.
484,Simply saying your reply was full of complete bullshit.
485,Businesses are closed and this certainly isn't a mild lockdown.
486,Sure it may only go for 7 days (hopefully) but you're completely wrong when you make claims that most businesses are still open.
487,Not sure why I should care you live a block away from exposure sites.
488,Presumably the athletes will be vaccinated?
489,"My takeaway was that it only took 30 cases for the State Government to mandate this, and for the community to comply."
490,Other countries more concerned about their FrEeDuMb would find this unfathomable.
491,But it’s why we’ve been one of the best places on the planet to live in since Covid hit.
492,No.
493,It's expected to come and go over and over again.
494,What will make people freak out is people freaking out.
495,"People taking safety *protocols* as a personal attack, and not killing the next virus by denying it hosts."
496,Australia is a little different though.
497,The vaccine rollout here has been a disaster.
498,We are producing close to 1million doses locally a week (of Astra).
499,But people weren't willing to go get it/weren't able to get an appointment
500,Cute.
501,It took 40 simultaneous cases just in my American middle school to get them to close for a month.
502,"The smart people are all vaccinated here now though, so at least contracting serious covid is a choice here."
503,"But man, America sucked at everything but the vaccine."
504,"yah, its when u start to mingle with others that you begin to increase your chances of transmission"
505,Thanks for the explanation.
506,I remember that false positive on HIV tests that the Australian vaccine caused.
507,[removed]
508,If you had told me a year ago that we’d have over 50% of people vaccinated and the country well on it’s way to being reopened by this time in 2021 I would’ve thought you were full of shit.
509,"Words cannot properly state how much respect I have for the scientists that worked on these vaccines, they are all heroes."
510,I'm not convinced web traffic = people who were on the fence have decided to get vaccinated
511,"There is almost 150 exposure sites, including two sporting events that saw 20k plus fans ."
512,anti vaxxers can't be thatmuch more prevalent in aus compared to the us no?
513,[removed]
514,"We would have a lot more death without the vaccines so relatively speaking, it’s not as big of a problem"
515,Yes they have locked down multiple times which is great...in terms of mitigating spread.
516,"I’m saying that infrequent small lockdowns are different to say the 6 months in lockdown, which has been standard in a lot of places."
517,Victoria has also had a different experience to a lot of Australian states.
518,WA for example has sailed through with very little inconvenience apart from the state border.
519,I think short sharp lockdowns are good.
520,Just not a permanent solution to a global problem.
521,"Meanwhile in small town USA the local high-school had 80 cases, and where I work (a casino) we have at least 7 cases."
522,Whole school district is going back to distance learning for 2 weeks.
523,And the casino remains business as usual lol.
524,It's amazing seeing how different countries have handled the virus.
525,"&gt;Had Sweden been more proactive in the beginning of the pandemic, they would not have the high score in northern Europe."
526,Calling deaths a high score is incredibly disrespectful to the dead.
527,It was the same here in Germany.
528,I was due to get AZ back in March and the govt pulled it that week so I got Pfizer instead.
529,I only got it because I work in a primary school.
530,"I believe it’s the same with Aus with only people under 60 who are in health care, schools etc, or have underlying health conditions."
531,That should be changing soon though.
532,I think the difference is that now most of the people in the over 60s category are fully vaccinated.
533,But yeah no one wants AZ unfortunately.
534,Hey neighbor.
535,At least the rent is cheap.
536,I miss west knox
537,(Not locked down) Because we didn’t pursue a zero covid policy.
538,"Also I must be missing a link because I just see a photo, no article."
539,[deleted]
540,i smell ww3
541,Nothing
542,Yeah mate.
543,That’s how you open back up in a week instead of in a year... or more.
544,What if I tell them I'm Guy Incognito and I forgot my photo ID?
545,"More like only possible because my country's federal government, after almost a year and a half, cannot even deliver the absolute bare minimum of a response in terms of vaccines or a dedicated quarantine facility."
546,"In one of the most world altering events since World War 2, our federal government dragged their feet so slowly that it was left up to the states to respond."
547,"Fuck Scott Morrison, the amorphous blob of a politician."
548,"Fuck his government dragging their feet while aged care facilities begged for adequate PPE, resulting in the majority of Covid deaths in Australia."
549,Return?
550,We've been getting colds non stop with a todler in the house for the last few weeks.
551,My comment seems relevant.
552,Around 70% of positive PCR tests (post infection) are found to be false positives after genomic sequencing.
553,Just look at the UK.
554,Took a matter of days for cases to go from double figures to quadruple figures.
555,How any one can entertain the idea Boris Johnson is a good PM I have no fucking idea.
556,What an utter shit show off a country.
557,Some states have made it a law that you can as well.
558,It’s disgusting
559,"I found that surprising, I thought Taiwan had it under control since the start of the pandemic."
560,How did it get out of hand so quickly?
561,"Well, Japan has vaccinated 1% of its population so they should be fine
/S"
562,The comparison is to US cities of similar size that have many times as many cases even today and aren't anywhere near as locked down.
563,You okay lol
564,"I´m not a corona denier, but the harsh lockdowns in Australia and New Zealand probably causes more harm than good."
565,Thanks for clarifying.
566,We had a slow roll out here in Germany but it has finally gained momentum.
567,They still haven’t opened up vaccination to all adults.
568,I’m vaccinated because I work in a primary school but for a lot of younger people (under 60)it’s still not available.
569,Our vaccination rates are finally improving and we’ve seen a huge drop in incidence rates that we never saw during the last 6 months of lockdown.
570,I really hope Australia gets access to more vaccines soon.
571,I know it’s a big logistical job trying to keep it cool and distribute it to rural areas etc.
572,The public needs to get on board because Australia can’t live in a bubble forever.
573,I say this as an Aussie wanting to visit home and have my family visit me.
574,"These lock downs tend to last 2 weeks to  stop spreading whilst people get tested and isolate, due to this the Australians have spent a fraction of there time in lock down compared to the rest of the world"
575,"Except we also need AZ for our second shots, and they are once again delivering below target,  J&amp;J is delivering jack shit, and even Biontech is not delivering what is promised."
576,I think the pandemic virus had something to do with that actually
577,Only over 50s in most areas.
578,And high risk people like care workers and people with underlying conditions.
579,Even then it can be hard to get.
580,"There definitely is hesitancy from people though, the media really played up the blood clotting."
581,"Fuck, even India is at 4%, n that's like a fucking billion+ people

Wtf is Australia doing"
582,Why are they relying on just lockdowns while ignoring vaccinees?
583,"Afaik Australia is low on vaccinees
Are they really hoping that they'll get a hold of this without having to vaccinate their population?"
584,"No, you just can’t get them"
585,No.
586,They’re forgettable because we have so many
587,Seems similar error to AZ trials - didn't include older people.
588,For AZ we now have real world data.
589,Any for Sinopharm?
590,That’s why this lockdown is bullshit
591,"With this recent lockdown the age restriction got reduced to 40+ but before that it was 50+ which only recently came down from 60+ 

So overall it has been tough to even be considered for the vaccine"

596,Yeah I hope so too.
597,I'd love to see hundreds of cargo planes loaded up and flown around the world to deliver vaccines.
598,And people believe the anti vax propaganda and refuse to be vaccinated.
599,I'm really sick of anti- vaxers (not people who can't get a vaccine for medical reason) using vaccinated people as their human shield against the virus.
600,They should be joining with everyone else to help protect the people who cannot be vaccinated.
601,Article is blocked in many places FYI.
602,I.cant read it
603,How did he found ?
604,[removed]
605,For now.
606,Wait until they want to actually go overseas.
607,Or if one of the highly infectious variants spreads.
608,Doesn’t take long.
609,Australia is isolated and has had strict borders which has really helped but it’s not a permanent solution.
610,The only way forward is vaccination.
611,"&gt;On May 23, Public Health England released pre-print research into how well vaccines stand up to the new VOC found that “effectiveness was notably lower after one dose of vaccine” compared to how well they withstood B.1.1.7.”

&gt;In particular, it found that the overall effectiveness of the Pfizer and AstraZeneca vaccines—which are the two main vaccines in Britain—went from 51.1 per cent against B.1.1.7 to 33.5 per cent against the newer Indian variant."
612,"(While those numbers are precise, researchers caution that they are generated from confidence interval ranges."
613,"So that 33.5 per cent is a range from 20.6 to 44.3, while 51.1 is a range from 47.3 to 54.7, so the difference in the effectiveness of first doses against each of the two VOCS may or may not turn out to be as wide as initially thought.)"
614,"&gt;Still, Pfizer and AstraZeneca held up after two doses."
615,"In particular, Pfizer’s effectiveness fell only to 87.9 per cent against B.1.617.2, from 93.4 per cent against B.1.1.7."
616,"And with the AstraZeneca vaccine, that two-dose effectiveness dropped to 59.8 per cent from 66.1 per cent."
617,Both options are a matter of life or death for many.
618,Chinese occupation of formerly free and souvereign regions is no joke for the occupied.
619,The Taiwanese government should carefully weigh all implications.
620,I’m not Australian.
621,But yes governments should have bought more and had stricter contracts that specified delivery dates and quantities rather than “best efforts”.
622,Hopefully the west allows their vaccines to be exported in larger numbers soon.
623,"Some more good news, 40% of the total US population are fully vaccinated 

https://usafacts.org/visualizations/covid-vaccine-tracker-states/"
624,It's still weird to not blame your government.

647,Nah that isn't really the case.
648,The problem is the way our vaccine system is setup and managed on a national level.
649,It's currently restricted to select groups and there are a few hoops to jump through normally to get an appointment.

698,The harsh reality is that the only entities qualified to make the leading vaccines are the companies that invented them and their licensees.
699,"Fortunately, there's a laser focus on expanding production, finding more raw materials and building additional factories around the world, so the vaccine supply should be ramping up quickly."

718,It has to be imported.
719,There is a traceable origin.
720,Sometimes it feels uncomfortable 🤷‍♀️
721,"Australia has two ways out of this in my view: wait for the entire world to become vaccinated and for Covid to essentially disappear as a result (this is unlikely for a variety of reasons), or to vaccinate 70-90% of their population and declaw the virus while accepting a limited amount of Covid spread within Australia as a result of reopening."
722,"If the latter is the best that can be done, they'd best get to it one way or the other."
723,How long do they have to stall before it doesnt matter or they say waiving IP rights wont make a difference?
724,Long enough for people to stop dying in the streets i guess.
725,"And then it's back, like it always will be, which was exactly the point of the comment you responded to."

752,Our vaccine rollout has been appalling
753,It's the first lock-down this year for Victoria.

774,"If you look at all covid deaths in US, females between 40-49 represent 1.05%."
775,So back in January that would be ~10 per day in UK based on that.
776,That demographic is doing much better with a vax than when covid was running rampant.

823,It's like they're constantly expecting that some armed gang is rolling through shooting things up and that the helicopters are the harbingers of it.
824,but I suppose that for a low exposure 44 years old the death risk from covid wasn't so higher than the AZ vaccine VITT - induced death risk... so I think little comfort could come from such a consideration

826,There’s 1.2 billion people in Africa.
827,120 million would do 10%.

845,I dread the next flu or stomach virus.
846,My body is not ready for that shit anymore.
847,"What a weird way to denote ""nine in 10."""
848,"Basically they think that platelets are being activated by the vaccine, releasing PF4 through activation, and then going into circulation because the EDTA is chelating away the calcium that is needed to hold the cell “glue” proteins in the capillary cell walls (cahderin) together, which is where the immune system sees the activated platelets and antigenic vaccine component complex and forms a clot."
849,Basically.
850,The EDTA is introduced here because they need a mechanism where the activated platelets can get into circulation to form the clot.
851,EDTA chelates calcium pretty well and we know that cahderins are cell glue proteins whose interaction is calcium dependent.
852,EDTA sequestration thus could increase this capillary cell interaction and allow the complex to escape.
853,In blood collection you are using EDTA to prevent clotting at a higher concentration in a blood sample removed from the body.
854,Coagulation depends on calcium so this is effective.
855,In this case it cannot work since the concentration is too low and the clot is distal (far away) from the injection point so clotting can still effectively occur.
856,[deleted]
857,I think there's some common sense area here.

862,What will be more interesting is to see how many people will continue to get booster shots.
863,"The economy is doing fine, we are now doing better than pre-covid and nevertook to much of a hit compared to most developed countries due to fast effective measures, so it wasn't a year of on and off measures with uncertain time lines."
864,"Australia also have the highest median wealth on the planet (jumped from 2nd to first during 2020 as well) so we've got a much larger breathing room than everyone too, it's three times the median wealth of the United states too!"
865,I honestly never understood the argument from the northern hemisphere that the economy is better off under constant ongoing covid restrictions than a short hard elimination strategy.
866,It didn't hold any weight with the Australian public which is why our government responded with/forced into elimination.

882,"Alberta seems to have had the worse situation (at their peak a coule weeks ago they had multiple days of over 2000 cases a day - way worse than the per capita of manitoba now), and they managed to turn things around for the time being - and that province is crawling with antimaskers and covid deniers."

953,But I sure wish we didn’t have to bribe people to do the basic human thing to get the damn vaccine in the first place.
954,"And if you think society isn’t in bad shape, I’d really be interested in your interpretation of what’s been happening in the US over the last year!"
955,"Another ""high"" day of deaths but don't worry, the 7-day death average is still dropping in the US."
956,Maryland just had a massive data dump on deaths.
957,Deaths are always the last to follow in any trend.
958,[removed]
959,Yeah this isn't a bribe it is a reward.
960,More carrot than stick and statistically speaking it will reward those who got it before the announcements.
961,This is a not an indictment of society.
962,I see what you’re saying here for sure.
963,A person who didn’t need convincing won.
964,"But I don’t think that’s really the goal overall - they just want to show that someone does win, that you can win too if you get shot up, and all of this is just kinda basic lottery theory."
965,"Fair to wish that the winner was someone who got brought in, I get it, but I don’t think it matters that it was a reasonable human :)"
966,[removed]
967,Yeah could be I don’t know enough to say…its just too bad some of the demographics least at risk from COVID are the ones most at risk from adverse side effects to the vaccines.
968,It makes the cost benefit complicated.
969,[removed]
970,Link to read w/ no paywall: https://archive.fo/QxvlY
971,I agree that deaths Aren’t dropping at nearly the rate of cases.
972,Hopefully soon
973,Do you really think there is any chance there won’t be FDA approval?
974,After 300 million shots with minimal issues?
975,"&gt;me wonder if something was uncovered very recently

***New information on Wuhan researchers' illness furthers debate on pandemic origins***

&amp;#x200B;

A State Department fact sheet released by the Trump administration in January said that the researchers had gotten sick in autumn 2019 but did not go as far as to say they had been hospitalized."
977,"China reported to the World Health Organization that the first patient with Covid-like symptoms was recorded in Wuhan on December 8, 2019."
978,You know the quality of news writing these days.
979,It's better if it's delegated to the real prose.
980,What did he say?
981,Love it when they delete instead of admitting they’re uninformed.
982,Still doesn’t answer a lot of questions
983,"Wow, I’m embarrassed for you."
984,Fucking mental cases are flocking to the Right... what has happened to them????
985,?
986,Conservative social media was full of people talking about murdering democrats through any means necessary if Trump didn’t win the election.
987,This is going to continue to be a domestic terror threat for a long time.
988,Simultaneous with tough lockdown restrictions.
989,Why do you think you don't need a mask?
990,Wasn't there a report that this is mutating and too rapid a rate?
991,[removed]
992,"I don't see why a theory needs a reliable news source to be valid, especially if it's based on common sense."
993,You are also a bot or automaton.
994,It's more difficult with people you know period.
995,Imagine you and your family go out shopping.
996,"You haven't been vaccinated but much of your family has, do you lie and chance getting called out by your family, or suck it up?"
997,Same thing when you go out with friends.
998,They gave the bloggers the name of a fictitious company in London.
999,Difference being.
1000,You can lie to the greeter at Wal-Mart.
1001,You can't lie to your friends and family and co-workers who have seen you scream Anti-Vax BS for the past 5 months.

1106,That's socialism.
1107,That is not at all my experience
1108,The 7 day worldwide average has reached &gt;30M!!!
1109,This is incredible I think it almost doubled in May.
1110,"about 2/3rds are from China lol but hey, whatever gets the world sooner to normalcy the better."
1111,"Also Japan doubled their doses in 2 weeks, gotta triple them by mid-june if they want the Olympics to go smoothly."
1112,"India's gotta pickup the pace, I know they're suffering but to see them apply 1/10th of what China's applying is kinda sad."
1113,She's clearly a real galaxy brain
1114,[removed]
1115,I hear you on wanting to wait.
1116,I am still stubbornly holding out for approval even though I will likely get hate for it.
1117,"I’ve had COVID, recovered, still work from home, wear my mask, and I’m pregnant."
1118,I doubt there’s anything wrong / dangerous in the vaccine but I would *really* like the full FDA stamp of approval...
1119,"Yeah, getting the vaccine, for at least a chunk of them, seems to imply that COVID is something they **need** to be vaccinated against, which goes squarely against the, ""it's not a big deal"" narrative their ego (and behavior) has been tied to for the past year"
1120,And?
1121,It really makes no difference to what I'm saying.
1122,Hundreds of people are dying and many of them could have been saved by the vaccine.
1123,"Upvoting because important, not because I'm glad to see kids dying."
1124,Bloomberg says about 1.78 billion doses given out at this point worldwide.
1125,291 million in the US alone.
1126,So we've already vaccinated over 10% of the Earth.
1127,The idea that there's some sort of nebulous side effect hiding in about 900 million vaccinated is just insanity.
1128,I've been trying to figure out why it's a good idea and why it could work.
1129,You explained it well!
1130,"That's the 7 day average, NYT Times reported 964 COVID deaths on the 26th."
1131,"I'm slightly short with that 964 death figure, NY Times reported 966 deaths on the 26th, with a rolling 7 day average of 522.

https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2021/us/covid-cases.html"

1145,I’m not going to let the antivax idiots get me sick.
1146,"Yeah, she was among the first groups of vaccinated people"
1147,Why is this article by pretty credible media outlets in Australia being blocked on here?
1148,https://www.smh.com.au/national/where-did-covid-come-from-the-case-for-a-leak-of-a-virus-engineered-in-a-wuhan-lab-20210526-p57vgt.html
1149,This sudden interest around investigating the origin makes me wonder if something was uncovered very recently that’s prompting us to dig deeper.
1150,"To be clear, even if it did come from a lab I don’t think it was for nefarious reason."
1151,It was probably due to incompetence/lack of appropriate security protocols.
1152,$5 million doesn't go very far when giving it to the population at large.
1153,If they divided it evenly among all employed people in Ohio they would each get about 95 cents.
1154,"Oh did not think of that, thx"
1155,I agree.
1156,But I heard that Israel pretty much dropped most restrictions a while ago and the US is in the process of dropping them.
1157,(the UK reopened a week ago and as I mentioned before that doesn't seem to be going very well for them)
1158,So we should worry about 80-100 year olds more than those risking their health by working in healthcare in your opinion?
1159,Excellent explanation of the psychology behind it!
1160,Thank you!
1161,"I didn’t enjoy certain aspects of the rules, and got temp bans more than once when things were insane here."
1162,But I promise that it didn’t have anything to do with “approved” theories.
1163,It was because the theories weren’t coming from quality news sources.
1164,"Believe me, I was *extremely* active here at the early height of the pandemic and I had a good feel for what the mods were doing."
1165,If anything they leaned right at that time.
1166,Might still.
1167,"Everytime I see a new thread about the new Biden investigation calls pop up, the first couple of comments I see are, yes, complaints about the past."
1168,"So anyway, I’ve realized that in turn I need to unsubscribe for now until this one runs whatever its course will be."
1169,"It’s been nice seeing the good news about lower cases come in, but I actually don’t like arguing on Reddit."
1170,:) Did enough in 2020.
1171,Ohio is giving away $5 million but it would cost ~$750 million to give everyone who gets vaccinated $100.
1172,"Russian propaganda, as effective as it is, is notorious for being sloppy and easy to sniff out."
1173,"What is the transmission rate at the jail, one wonders."
1174,"&gt; Newsom, a Democrat facing a likely recall election this year, said the money for California’s program will be well-spent if it convinces reluctant residents to get vaccinated."
1175,This is so utterly irrelevant.
1176,"He’s not losing the recall election, and this isn’t to shore up any lack of votes."
1177,"Might as well say Newsom, a man who started kickboxing at his local gym, said the money will be well-spent..."
1178,"You have no idea what I care about, because you haven't engaged in a discussion."
1179,"You've ranted from what you think is a position of moral superiority, and it's pretty gross."

1182,Hopefully the guy can hang on for a couple of months and survive being proven wrong.

1184,"Then, he can change the minds of a few others, and so on and so forth."
1185,One hopes.

1195,None have had to be hospitalized.
1196,Just anecdotal but thought id share
1197,What is wrong with people?
1198,Why the religious hatred for a vaccine that actually works?
1199,When Miami did its vaccination on the beach campaign a few wks ago they were getting mostly tourists.
1200,Most Locals who wanted vaccines already got theirs.
1201,So is this good or bad?
1202,Cries in Singapore
1203,HIPAA only applies to healthcare providers and related entities such as insurers.
1204,A concert venue is not that
1205,&gt;*They still haven’t opened up vaccination to all adults.
1206,* I’m vaccinated because I work in a primary school but for a lot of younger people (under 60)it’s still not available.
1207,I don't think this is correct anymore.
1208,"I'm in my early 40's, living in Bayern, and I managed to get the Johnson &amp; Johnson vaccination on Wednesday this week, simply by finding a random medical clinic with a vacancy and making a booking online."
1209,"While talking with the doctor my age was only bought up as it related to the risk of blood clots (I'm considered low risk at my age due to being male), and there is nothing to qualify me ahead of anyone else."
1210,"I spoke with another person my age in the waiting room, and his situation was essentially the same."
1211,"So I think if an adult here is able to find a medical clinic with vaccination appointments free, they can go get it as long their age/gender doesn't put them in the at-risk category if it's an AZ or J&amp;J vaccine."
1212,Yeah Ontario is a joke.
1213,"Sincerely, sad citizen of Ontario."
1214," The rate of complications is much, much lower than the rate of complications for COVID, and a journalist is very likely to be exposed to the virus."
1215,Good.
1216,Read about this the other day.
1217,People want to go back to normal so badly but don’t want to do the bare minimum like masking and vaccinating.
1218,(I’m aware that a very small portion of the population can’t get vaccinated.
1219,This is why everyone who CAN needs to).
1220,No one knows for sure until they investigate from all avenue.
1221,I am not defending anyone including the US.
1222,"So many have lost their lives, we all deserve an full detailed investigation."
1223,"Again, investigating is not accusing, I am not accusing anyone or country but we need some answers."
1224,"Looks like responsibility, to me."
1225,Nope.
1226,First day in NJ without masks.
1227,"Went to supermarket today, probably was a 50/50 split."
1228,Big sign on front door saying Masks no longer required.
1229,American is healing!
1230,Why?

1239,There is still no evidence that it was intentional.
1240,It sounds like they can’t exclude an accidental leak from the lab but that is far from an intentional leak.
1241,&gt;Do all of the vaccinated Americans here have big plans for the holiday weekend?
1242,Gonna Party Like It's ~~1999~~ 2019.
1243,"They’re not comparable using that metric, of course."
1244,They are comparable in that both can lead to serious illness and both can lead to hospitals getting overwhelmed if left unchecked.
1245,"I agree efforts are being taken to combat obesity but it’s all very ‘softly softly’, mainly I suspect for fear of offending."
1246,No need to patronise me saying ‘in case you didn’t notice’.
1247,I have the opposite problem and only need to look at a bar of chocolate to put on weight.
1248,"I lost about 45kg a few years ago so am more than aware of the issue

Edit: my brother also struggles to gain weight so I know how it is also a serious struggle and one that is all too often dismissed as ‘oh I wish I had that problem’"
1249,If you compare the NZ approach to the NSW approach then the NZ level system is political theater to hide the fact that lockdowns are the only way NZ can deal with an outbreak.
1250,In NSW what would be considered level one restrictions in NZ is the equivalent of no community spread.
1251,Everything is normal with no masks anywhere.
1252,"The only thing you need to do is sign in at restaurants, pubs, gyms and basically anywhere you are going to be inside for any length of time."
1253,All the restrictions are to help contact tracers get ahead of an outbreak but barely effect day to day life.
1254,The NSW equivalent of NZ level two restrictions is when there is an outbreak.
1255,Limits on gatherings in indoors settings and masks on public transport and indoors public spaces.
1256,NSW has not needed a level three type lockdown since the initial lockdown.
1257,"Comparing this with the NZ system, level one provides no help to the contact tracers as venue login isn't required and isn't enforced."
1258,Level two still allows a hundred people at a single venue so doesn't stop super spreader events.
1259,"Level four seems to exist solely to allow the population to think that ""Well, we're in level three lockdown but atleast it's not level four"""
1260,"CDC said 80% https://www.cnbc.com/2021/03/29/cdc-study-shows-single-dose-of-pfizer-or-moderna-covid-vaccines-was-80percent-effective.html

U.K.'s Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) said short-term efficacy was 89 percent between days 15 and 21 after the first dose."
1261,Israel reported similar finds to the UK.
1262,I am sure Taiwan or any nearby country will be willing to pay for it
1263,Isn't this how pretty much all viruses except influenza work?
1264,You get it once (or get vaccinated once) and either you die from it or you have lifetime immunity.
1265,It's not like we have to get MMR shots every year.
1266,So far there's no evidence that SARSCoV2 mutates like influenza.
1267,Well good thing you're a doctor!
1268,That's pathetic
1269,Having my engagement party and seeing some extended family for the first time since christmas '19
1270,Here in america we just let people die because they don't listen anyways.
1271,I do feel bad for Japan as they are in a no win situation.
1272,If they hold the Olympics they look callous and irresponsible in the face of domestic suffering.

1333,Australia and New Zealand both had the virus under control and opted not to dig into the already strained supply.
1334,One of the reasons we are able to get so many vaccines in Canada is because countries like Aus and NZ held off.
1335,"Well seeing as vaccines won’t eradicate the virus, and the WHO has declared covid to be endemic, seems like you’re the one spewing random nonsense without any forethought."

1370,We are getting vaccinated like everywhere else…are you just writing every thought that passes through your mind without even giving it an ounce of forethought?
1371,Remember the age group.
1372,"Here, because it's 18-20 year old healthy people, the control group doesn't have as many symptomatic people either."
1373,The vaccines are tested on a larger age group - where you would see more symptomatic cases.
1374,"Basically, this showed about 80% efficacy within 6 moths."
1375,"Better than the J&amp;J, at least in the short time period, but still it doesn't protect 1 in 5 from infection."
1376,"Regarding getting vaccinated, as you said there's evidence that it almost acts as a booster for people who had been previously infected."

1388,80% of Australia is still partying 😂 This lockdown is just in one state.
1389,We'll get it back down to zero and go back to partying soon.
1390,And when they’re reopened how do you expect to remain “covid free for the rest of time”?
1391,"Last lockdown, we were good enough that we got 7 months of packed streets with no covid in sight."
1392,"When we didn't go into lockdown fast enough, we managed to have a maximum of over 700+ cases a day and an even more brutal lockdown."
1393,We don't want this covid to go up shit's creek again.
1394,LOL - you did EXACTLY what my comment refers to... you look at one political item (following the rules better) and ignore every other factor.
1395,"Which is odd, since Texas was the first state to open up without any restrictions and currently has a rate lower than most northern states."
1396,Almost like **seasonality** has a large part of the spread...

1433,My guess is that Aus maybe only has access to AZ at the moment...is that right?
1434,This.
1435,In other words: nobody knows.
1436,You also have to consider that generally our building standards are not up to the standards of other places that have consistent cold weather.

1580,This is literally the point that so many people seem to be missing about this.
1581,"Your immune system remembers what it saw (i.e., the protein signature for the portion of the virus that your immune system recognizes and binds)."
1582,"This article is literally talking about a study that suggests that ""memory"" doesn't go away quickly."
1583,"What that implies is that it will be mutations that we will need to worry about, not our immune system ""forgetting"" its previous exposure through vaccination or infection."
1584,"The question is what mutations will occur (we don't know) and how drastic of an affect any particular mutation will have on decreasing the ability for our immune system to recognize the virus (again, we don't know)."
1585,Anyone talking one way or another definitively on this is literally just guessing.
1586,The number you’re talking about is extremely small and Florida’s unvaccinated rate is over 50% .
1587,"How does it make sense to allow the unvaccinated, who majority are doing it by choice, to go into a event where they have an increased chance to get a disease that could spread it to people who legitimately can’t get it for medical reasons and get them sick ?"
1588,They are putting themselves at risk true .
1589,But then they also put others at risk who don’t have a choice.
1590,You still have to mask and distance.
1591,I don't know why people didn't want to get vaccinated when they heard that.

1649,Except people who have been vaccinated will still get sick and die because the vaccines are not perfect.
1650,Getting vaccinated doesn't solve the problem entirely.
1651,And you choose to ignore the rest of the article and hone in on one quote without any context?
1652,I tend to think that 99.9% of people traveling across an international border are not going to lie about their vaccination status to the border authorities and forge vaccination cards.

1676,There is a WORLD of difference between a country barring travel and private businesses getting access to your health records.
1677,0 people should be in favor of a vaccination license that can be used to refuse service at private businesses.

1694,Yeah it doesn't make sense.
1695,India could benefit if these posts gain some traction.
1696,I wish we had your government!
1697,😭 And I'm not even from the US.
1698,Given that it has been a couple of weeks since your week I would say you have a decent enough protection.
1699,"Still, get the second shot when you are eligible as well for a more long-term protection and better protection against variants."
1700,"Seppos shouldn't be trying to tell us we are doing terribly, you're also probably one of the people on here complaining a while back that Australia put in orders to vaccinate 3x the population, stay out of our politics, take a cement tablet and harden up"
1701,Weighing in from Trinidad and Tobago here.
1702,We had several days of zero cases in Feb and then a slow tsunami leading up to record breaking numbers (for us) of cases and deaths in May.
1703,"Complacency is what happened, and it’s expected when you get tired of living with restrictions to human contact for a year."
1704,"If - while the population is largely unvaccinated - the approach doesn’t consider lots of mental health support and communication that addresses the stress that lack of socializing causes, people will let their guard down and socialize in increasingly irresponsible ways."
1705,And then the conditions are ideal for the virus to take hold and spread.
1706,In our case that was made worse by the appearance of the Brazil/P1 variant.
1707,I expect it’s a similar story in the countries mentioned above.
1708,Expect that riskier socialization will happen.
1709,And then be prepared to lock down *as soon* as cases begin to increase.
1710,"Don’t hesitate, lock it down."
1711,"And in a country where vaccine supply is low, be prepared to be flexible in your rollout plan."
1712,"If your priority category is 60+ and they’re hesitant, switch it up and allow a period where other high risk categories can be vaccinated."
1713,"Also include a segment of those who are likely to contribute most to spread, but who are willing to take the vaccine and willing to talk about it."
1714,Let their word of mouth counter the anti vax narrative.
1715,These are lessons learnt in hindsight but there’s a lot of that these days.
1716,"Considering that's what you undoubtedly thought in February of 2019, yes that's what I'm saying."
1717,Let's not forget the 1100 is for mroe than a calendar year and most of it before half our state has been vaccinated
1718,"Sorry, we need them first buddy."
1719,seems excessive
1720,Fantastic!
1721,Australia's COVID-19 infection rate has been skyrocketing and that of Hawaii has been plunging.
1722,Hawaii has 23.5x more people fully vaccinated than Australia.
1723,"I mean I've been to Australia, the total population is like 20 million, it anyway looks like this."
1724,😂
1725,[deleted]
1726,That’s not true.
1727,There’s a phased rollout where different people are eligible based on their age or other risk factors.
1728,The majority of people I know who are eligible have registered their interest or have received their first vaccine.
1729,Australia administered approx 115K vaccines today.
1730,Australia started our vaccination program late February as we weren’t aiming for emergency approval/use of the vaccines.
1731,So we’re behind a lot of other countries that had a sense of urgency to get their population vaccinated.
1732,"""Its not a race."
1733,"There is no rush"" - Scomo on Vaccines"
1734,Same reason why I’m sleeping on the couch tonight.
1735,"Covid isn't endemic anywhere - if it was, you would see a roughly steady baseline."
1736,No we haven’t.
1737,Our childhood vaccination is some of the highest in the world.
1738,You might be thinking of the fact that the debunked autism caused by vaccination study was from an Australian.
1739,But that doesn’t actually translate to the whole population being more antivax.
1740,"Vaccines are hard to get hold of when the whole world views you as low on the triage list, and you cannot locally manufacture mRNA vaccines."
1741,"We bet a lot on a local vaccine, due local manufacturing, that had the unfortunate side effect of making people test positive for HIV (although without giving them the disease)."
1742,"Canned that one, now slow boating it from here."
1743,"Either way, vaccines alone wouldn't let us hold business as normal unless we were above, say, Canada's position today - which we'd never be, given relative different experiences and urgencies."
1744,So stomping it out is still required in the interim.

1752,NSW had a higher baseline level of restrictions for a good 12mo there - part of the contact tracing strategy.

1766,A lot of shady shit IIRC.
1767,Not forever... until we get vaccinated
1768,"It's not hysteria, it's propaganda."
1769,After 18 months??
1770,No one in North America has been in lockdown for 18 months 🙄
1771," it doesnt help when Italy blocks a shipment of 250,000 doses to heading to australia because a grudge they have with the supplier."
1772,"only 250k I know but still, how dumb.."
1773,&gt; Why are they still relying on lockdowns so heavily?
1774,"Because as a general rule, our economies are fully open - nightclubs closing at 6am kind of deal - and masks are a rarity."
1775,"Take this current outbreak - it has cases attending two major football stadiums, what looks like a bender of a weekend (all night, half dozen venues), etc."
1776,"So until vaccines are at herd immunity stage, ie the equivalent of other fully open economies (ie: only parts of the US, now, really), we either need to throttle back massively and sustain it until we reach that stage... or we need to lockdown and extinguish."
1777,"We're currently opting for the latter, because at this stage it seems less disruptive than throttling entire sectors of the economy for months on end, waiting for vaccines."
1778,[deleted]
1779,"People in the west will eat it up like cake, just like they did with the WMDs."
1780,"It's a lost cause, it's been a decade of manufacturing consent, people are ready to fight the spooky scary China."
1781,It was a poor choice to go with AZ and not consider making the mRNA vaccines here.
1782,It was clear when the calls were being made.
1783,"So yes, the government should be accountable to poor choices."
1784,Is this true?
1785,I’m in QLD and have registered online but I’ve been told I can’t get one yet.
1786,Do you reckon I can just show up and they’ll give it to me?
1787,[removed]
1788,Any tldr?
1789,Yep.
1790,It gets even better – the reason that the outbreak happened in the Medi hotel is because we don’t actually have a standard hotel quarantine system in this country.
1791,The guidelines that we follow in Victoria are actually quite strict because we’ve had a terrible experience with hotel quarantine outbreaks.
1792,We’ve learnt our lesson.
1793,The problem is that the federal government guidelines do not recognise or attribute the same risk to airborne transmission of the virus in close spaces like hotel corridors as we do in Victoria.
1794,"As a result, the other states follow the national guidelines and therefore we get outbreaks in these hotels."
1795,"To make other things absolutely clear the poor traveller who set off this outbreak after coming back home from the other state, did absolutely nothing wrong during his hotel quarantine."
1796,He open the door in his room at the Wrong time to pick up his meal and got infected from the person in the room across him.
1797,They were confident their system was gonna work for this entire year and decided to not step up their vaccination process...I hope they can contain this and other outbreaks cause their vaccination rate is tragic

1799,The fuck's a Tassie?
1800,This place is going to be an utter ghost town by the summer.
1801,You love to see it.

1803,This same government has an election coming up.
1804,They will get re-elected :/
1805,Fair point.
1806,"In that case, assuming that people get their second dose 6 weeks after their first, we should look at the number from 6 weeks ago instead (16 April 2021)."
1807,"The closest data to that date is Apr 15 (0.93%), and Apr 18 (0.96%)."
1808,"Okay, I'll accept that, the number of *fully* vaccinated people in Japan right now is probably about 1%."
1809,"Though I would note that the graph kicks steeply upwards from April 18th, so their rate of vaccination is certainly increasing."
1810,Lousy.
1811,"They announced a phased rollout, where the first phase was frontline workers &amp; senior citizens."
1812,"Then at *some point* when enough of them have been vaccinated, the next phase would begin."
1813,"Problem is, senior citizens are all over Facebook getting bullshit info, so they're not getting vaccinated."
1814,"So we're in this ridiculous situation where the Federal &amp; State Governments are upset that not enough people are getting vaccinated for the country to be safe, but most of the country aren't allowed to be vaccinated &amp; there's no timetable for it to happen."
1815,Vaccinate the populace and rejoin the rest of humanity.
1816,Minimum - not freak out each time we get a case (the vaccine mitigates the impact of the virus on your body so our hospitals aren’t inundated with the sick)
1817,That is borderline criminal.
1818,Three percent??
1819,?
1820,I would if traveling wasn’t a pain in the ass right now.
1821,"&gt; And yes, this is absolutely no way to live for another 12 months - near normality in fortress Australia with stage 4 lockdowns at the drop of a hat :/

What would you prefer?"
1822,Why wouldn't it be endemic.
1823,Plenty of people will have it and get it but not be getting tested so it will just become part of our daily lives.
1824,The US problem is a poor healthcare system.
1825,In Scotland it is really not an issue.
1826,These lockdowns have been pretty much unnecessary.
1827,Yes.
1828,He got it when he flew into Adelaide and quarantined in a medi hotel there.
1829,Then went to Melbourne and spread it a little.
1830,"But there has been a missed person who got it from him and hasn't been found yet, and it's managed to spread quite a bit before they realised, and now Melbourne is in a 7 day lockdown and there are 14,000+ primary and secondary contacts in iso."
1831,fr?
1832,that's really impressive.
1833,"I had to check to believe, but it looks like 10% fully vaccinated n 25-30% one dose."
1834,"For bolsanaro, that's mighty impressive  


Says a lot about australia n india that even bolsanaro is doing significantly better"
1835,Yeah some were really harsh.
1836,I can’t say our lockdown was anywhere near that bad but I believe there were places in the world where it was much stricter.
1837,[removed]
1838,Many reasons.
1839,* Australia's own vaccine didn't work out.
1840,"It looks like it might have been effective against Covid, but it also had a side effect of making HIV tests false positive."
1841,"* Took a long time to spin up local AZ production, then the blood clots caused Pfizer to be recommended for people under 50."
1842,All of which has to be imported and was in low supply until a few days ago.
1843,"* Even people eligible for AZ have been complacent or reluctant, just sitting around saying there's no Covid here so why bother."
1844,And the decision to stop recommending AZ for under 50s meant some eligible people started to make a fuss they want it too and will wait around for it.
1845,sigh.
1846,* The government's done a shit job of promoting the vaccine.
1847,"Boring ad campaigns, politicians jibber-jabbering about it, no creative messaging."
1848,* Logistics have been slow and confusing.
1849,"It was meant to go to GZs, but GPs didn't have doses."
1850,"Took months to set up big centres, apparently no real planning or urgency."
1851,People who became eligible yesterday reported they had to call a phone line dozens of times.
1852,* Moderna apparently won't accept any legal liability and the government wouldn't budge on that in negotiations for a long time.
1853,"Novavax is coming, um, maybe sometime?"
1854,?

1865,It'll pick up pace I think.
1866,I had my first AZ a couple of weeks ago but won't count as vaccinated until second shot in 10 weeks from now.
1867,There'll be a bump then as I was early in my group (50+) and they'll all push the stats up.

1885,The EU refused to ship 250k doses to Australia because the situation is a lot worse in the EU compared to Australia.

1896,Where do people keep getting this idea that AUS is a bunch of antivaxxers?
1897,We don’t have a high vaccination rate due to there not being an urgent need in the majority of the country.
1898,"Also, while we’re speaking too dumb to get vaccinations, when we _are_ all eligible and vaccines are being pushed, I can guarantee you we’ll have a higher vaccination rate than the states."
1899,"Also, as an American speaking to another American, the attitude in your response to me is why most of the world generally despises Americans."
1900,"&gt;It took a frigging outbreak caused by a single happless returned traveller (who actually got infected with COVID From another quarantine hotel resident), to put 5 million of us back in this situation in a matter of 72 hours."
1901,This was a hotel quarantine in a different state as well right?
1902,"Why vaccinate, when you can just  shut down society for weeks at a time, and ban people from seeing their spouses for over a year?"
1903,You’ve done just that every year of your life up until the past 12 months
1904,Preventing another similar pandemic dwarfs concerns like this.
1905,"If the lab leak happened and was caused by gain of function research, it should discussed heavily and policies changed."
1906,"Good-More Asian governments need to start mentally preparing the local population for the inevitable-Mass vaccinations, endemic virus and lesser focus on cases (as opposed to hospitalizations and deaths)."
1907,"Holy shit, I live in Western Australia and my school first got shut (April 2020) for 2 weeks because about 20 community cases across the whole city."
1908,Earlier this year we shut down the whole state for 1 week because we got 1 community case.
1909,[removed]

2109,"Most (or at least a substantial portion) controversial commentary in the sub right now surrounds the idea of variants, and vaccinations."
2110,"Continued visibility of high levels of infection and mortality counters the 'all clear' narrative, moving into 'variants as fearmongering' downplays the obvious increase in severity over time since the pandemic began."
2111,Early reliance on seropositivity studies seemed to show high penetration rates long before the far more visibly severe second wave.
2112,"This suggests either the studies were bad, or, the studies were good *and* the capacity for reinfection is higher than the acceptable narrative."
2113,"This plays into vaccine effectiveness concerns that hinge the entirety of a return to normal, and an ongoing clash over does it / doesn't it as if it were entirely binary."
2114,"Overall, the trend seems to be 'when in doubt if it supports your perspective, downvote it', and can be seen in the vote ratios that includes 3 options, 2 of which require engagement."
2115,"This is very alarming...

2138,He wasn’t arguing against that; he merely was stating his preference.
2139,Idk why you think it needs to be forever given how many infections happened over the late fall and winter.

2184,*
2185,Just ways down the innerstate from Bluntvul.
2186,"On the Facebook announcement, it said vaccinated California’s are automatically entered."
2187,There was no link but I presume that means everyone.
2188,Hopefully?
2189,Mama needs new shoes lol
2190,I swear I stopped seeing those words summer of 2020.
2191,"Had Sweden been more proactive in the beginning of the pandemic, they would not have the high score in northern Europe."
2192,Sucks they didn't take it serious for a long time.
2193,Even tegnell thought the pandemic would be over by may last year.
2194,I guess you like hyperbole.
2195,"But to answer your question as if it was serious -- we haven't had any large scale civil unrest during the pandemic to require martial law, and things are actually getting better, not worse -- at least in the US."
2196,In some sense we're lucky that Covid was a relatively mild pandemic (even the UK variant).
2197,"We would have had major failures of all kinds of infrastructure and supply chains if it had been something like a very infectious version of the original SARS from 2003, with 14% mortality."
2198,"The reality is she believes the vaccine to either 1) be a conspiracy to control society and oppress her rights, and/or 2) be a manifestation of liberal/leftist/communist ideology, and that any actions taken which ultimately discourage or lead to the elimination of the vaccine are justified."
2199,Looks like I need to start praying to RNGesus.
2200,"Yeah, but they act this way out of a deep seated fear."
2201,Not any real fear of any vaccine; it seems like what these people fear most is being wrong.
2202,It’s like their egos demand validation and they will harm others in a desperate search of that validation.
2203,And those who don’t pander to these lunatic’s egos?
2204,...aren’t seen as worthy of any type of human consideration.
2205,[deleted]
2206,Eh no?
2207,I'm saying that the US shouldn't be banning exports while the rest of the world struggles with supply and relies on us and India.
2208,I believe those numbers are for two doses.
2209,"Unfortunately, it seems that one dose is only about 33% effective against this particular variant, so best to be cautious until one is fully vaccinated - https://www.bmj.com/content/373/bmj.n1346"

2213,I know things like physical school being closed lead to this along with other restrictions.
2214,"But as a teacher (and yes this is anecdotal) the cases I’m seeing are from kids who have had prior mental health issues that parents are only now noticing, and of course being home all the time worsened situations."
2215,Ah but those people were liberals so it's ok they deserve to die.
2216,"When I heard folks like Eric-Feigl Ding and other doom-sayers worry about variants, I would turn to some others (e.g Eric Topol) for the more optimistic (and in hindsight correct) takes."
2217,"However, I am starting to see even the more optimistic-sounding experts start to sorta kinda raise a mini-alarm about thee B.1.617.2 (India) variant."
2218,Fingers crossed there is nothing to worry much about.
2219,I neeeeeed my normal summer!

2227,Are you implying the abysmal vaccine roll out by the EU is the fault of US export bans?
2228,"Good luck in jail, I’ve heard covid is running rampant in jail."
2229,[removed]
2230,It's pretty sad when people want money over their health.
2231,"When you get older, you will really value your health."
2232,"like ... at literally any point throughout the procedure \[before the needle is put in\], you can just say ""changed my mind, sorry, I'm gonna leave now"" and any attempt to not let you leave or put a needle into your body would result in criminal charges to the person not respecting your decision."

2277,Wife’s cousin works for border patrol.
2278,He thinks it’ll rewrite his DNA and all his co workers feel the same way.

2290,"I think Doug Ford is scared that one dose isn't enough and that it will cause another huge wave if they reopened, but as this study points to (and future real world evidence in other provinces will), the one dose strategy will likely drive down infections alot."
2291,I expect the Ontario reopening plan will be changed once it's abundantly clear that it's safe to fully reopen.
2292,What do you expect from a raving lunatic?
2293,This issue likely would never come up in clinical trials even if they were ran for 10 years.
2294,It's too rare.
2295,Even a trial with 100000 participants would likely not even register one such case as half of those participants are getting placebo.
2296,"True, actual use of the medicine is a part of testing it but it should not be phrased this way."
2297,Tests were short but what we observe now is not the shortness fault.
2298,"Those side effects are rare, too rare to be observed in trials."
2299,Is it fault of vaccine manufacturers?
2300,"Maybe the vaccines could have been designed to be better, adenovirus-platelet interaction and RNA splicing is well known."
2301,But I don't think that any previous attempts at adenovirus-vectored vaccines took that into consideration.
2302,But it's hard to tell.
2303,"I realize your mind cannot grasp the scale of how many people live in California, but 100 million spread across all inhabitants of California is nothing (like $3/person)."
2304,"It’s not only for one person, you dolt."
2305,The literal point of taxes is for the government to make sure the American people are taken care of and that everything functions.
2306,Go move to a remote island in the middle of nowhere if you want.
2307,That sounds like what you are expecting.
2308,Good luck with the lack of infrastructure in your makeshift hut.
2309,"Yes, exactly."
2310,"Like adenovirus vectors used in gene therapy are already known to cause anti-PF4 antibodies and as a result, this thrombocytopenia very commonly."
2311,The adenovirus dose in the vaccine is much lower but it's still causing this much more rarely.
2312,It has been suspected (Dr. John Campbell in the UK is a big proponent of this) that accidental intra-vascular injections (bad injection technique usually) hitting a blood vessel may lead to a higher dosage reaching the bloodstream in some individuals and cause this autoimmune reaction to be more likely to happen.
2313,I find it incredibly hard to believe that this has anything to do with the spike protein when adenovirus vectors in higher dose are known to cause *exactly* the same thing.

2384,*Don't be gay* or *don't be brown* is not a reasonable remedy for such exclusion.

2390,It's not that people don't know what Hershey's miniatures taste like.
2391,People just love free stuff.
2392,Natural immunity causes more reactivity to other parts of the virus (antigens) and less to the spike protein receptor domain.
2393,"&gt; The vaccines induced robust reactivity levels, including antibodies against the full-length spike protein, S1 and S2 subunits, and the receptor binding domain (RBD) of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, which binds to the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor on host cells."
2394,Cross-reactive antibodies between the spike protein and RBD induced by the vaccine could possibly provide protection against emerging variants.
2395,"&gt; This differs from the response from natural infection, which had weak antibody levels against RBD but produced the highest levels of antibodies against nucleocapsid protein (NP) antigens."
2396,Anti-nucleocapsid antibodies weren’t affected by the vaccines and could indicate prior natural exposure.

2481,"""The results are based on outcomes two weeks after administering two shots to some 862,000 people -- more than 712,000 who received CoronaVac and almost 150,000 Pfizer."
2482,"The CoronaVac vaccine reduces coronavirus mortality by 97 percent, according to early results of the immunization campaign in Uruguay, which relies heavily on the Chinese jab."
2483,"In people who had received two doses, it reduced infection with the coronavirus by 57 percent and intensive care admissions by 95 percent, said a report by the health ministry of the South American nation."
2484,"The Pfizer shot, the results showed, was 75 percent effective at preventing infection, 99 percent effective at preventing illness requiring ICU admission, and 80 percent effective at preventing death."
2485,"It has reserved the Pfizer-BioNTech jab for older people, health workers, and people other illnesses."

2509,"From the AMA on this sub yesterday

&gt;Long-term side effects following any vaccination are extremely rare."
2510,"Vaccine monitoring has historically shown that if side effects are going to happen, they generally happen within six weeks of receiving a vaccine dose."
2511,"&gt;  
&gt;For this reason, the Food and Drug Administration required each of the authorized COVID-19 vaccines to be studied for at least eight weeks after the final dose."
2512,over 280 million doses in the US have been given and no long-term side effects have been detected.
2513,"\-American Medical Association President, Dr. Gerald Harmon"
2514,This would backfire hard in Germany and other countries of europe.
2515,Right now it‘s not easy to get vaccinations and the vaccination centers only vaccinate risk patients.
2516,Almost everyone wants to get vaccinated but can‘t because they are on a waiting list.
2517,"Don‘t know about the situation in the US, though."
2518,Can confirm.
2519,I didn't get the vaccine when it was offered because the vax centre around the corner had no space for me.
2520,The nearest was 20 mins away.
2521,Nah I'm alright.
2522,So I waited the next time I checked it was about 40 miles away.
2523,Umm... No.
2524,Next time it was 13 miles and I definately jumped on that.
2525,It'll happen pretty quickly too.
2526,Today was the first time that the feds said everyone would be double dosed by the end of the summer instead of beginning of the fall.
2527,And I really don't think they're being sly about this by claiming that it's still summer until September 21st.
2528,"Supply is holding steady at high volumes, and Moderna seems to have possibly gotten their supply chain figured out; I think we'll be done by mid-August, if not sooner."
2529,The shipments of AZ doses will also help; the people who stepped up and got that one will be fully vaccinated weeks before everyone else.

2745,"Also a huge part of it could be that Sinovac only has a 3% effectiveness with 1 shot (based on studies by the Chilean government) hence getting people protected takes in total 42 days since the first shot (28 days between doses and 14 extra days after the second shot for secured antibodies), so obtaining antibodies and protection is slower than other vaccines (Pfizer is also used in Chile but it’s like about 10% of vaccinated people, the large majority being Sinovac) which could explain why Chile is still on the rise."

2866,I think El Salvador has a higher percentage of vaccinations compare to Australia lol
2867,"In addition, it's under 40s now, not just under 30s, and also just recommendations."
2868,They're still giving out AZ to under 30/40s when that's the only vaccine that the centre has in stock on a given day.

2933,I'm not really following your question here.. what about a teacher in Japan ?
2934,Just talked to an Australian at the bar yesterday.
2935,He said this exact same thing.
2936,Since their numbers have been so low and they have not suffered a major outbreak many feel it is unnecessary to get vaccinated.

2957,Bought in by traveler A quarantining in a quarantine hotel at a nearby state (South Australia).
2958,"So another person (traveler B) who was also staying at that quarantine hotel, opened their door for a short duration (1 min) apparently the air from the traveler A's room blew into traveler B's room."
2959,"This was at the end of traveler B's hotel stay, so when traveler B got tested before they left the hotel, traveler B tested negative (either false negative or was too early to give exact reading)."
2960,"This happens because when a person such as traveler A is infected/positive, they will emit viral load into the air."
2961,This can build up quite a bit in an enclosed room.
2962,"Now if traveler A used the aircon or anything like that, this air with high density viral load can easily infect someone if breathed in."
2963,Anyway... traveler B tested negative and was released from the quarantine hotel.
2964,"He then flew to Melbourne, Victoria and shortly later on, developed symptoms."
2965,Traveler B however moved around the community and seemed to have infected some people.
2966,This lead to the outbreak which is happening now.

2974,The Labor State government - not the Federal Australian government (the Commonwealth).
2975,"The UK, pre-Brexit and post-Brexit, remains far more connected to nearby countries than Australia."
2976,"Also, the UK is far from ""sparsely-populated"", as is Australia."
2977,Saying ‘Australian’ winter makes as much a sense as saying an ‘American’ winter…once you consider the range of climates in the US.
2978,You might be underestimating the size of Australia.
2979,"It takes around 5+ hours to fly from one side to the other, and about the same from the bottom to the top"
2980,There isn’t a chance it’s 99% safe.
2981,"I'm a brit who had my 1st AZ back in February because we were given no choice of vaccine and I wish we had been a choice or at least some fucking guidance of what to now do if we're under 40 and don't want the 2nd AZ jab, instead I feel left behind while everyone else is now being given alternatives, I don't feel any national pride for AZ/Oxford vaccine."
2982,"We are pretty far from the equator and days of sunshine in winter are limited, so we barely get any vitamin d. This is the main reason we fared worse than any other state last year and almost certainly again this year."
2983,Through previous lock downs there was a huge amount of support from the federal and state governments through grants and wage subsidies.
2984,"Many will say it wasn't enough, but it kept many businesses afloat at least."
2985,Problem is largely when these lock downs are announced with little to no notice.
2986,"Hospitality venues in particular suffer due to spoilage, lost revenue etc."
2987,"There's no current support for businesses for this lock down, but it's expected the state government will produce something shortly"
2988,"There are reasons, many financial commitments will have been made for particular dates, for example."
2989,The question is whether the games can confidentally be run safely or not.
2990,"If the answer isn't 99% yes, then they should be delayed."
2991,We don’t count states that can’t reliably be found on maps of Australia
2992,"That might be because it is a common area of the building, but I'm not a lawyer."
2993,"It should be legal if the party was hosted in someones home, and the host knows the people invited."

&gt;Scientists in Germany claim to have cracked the cause of the rare blood clots linked to the Oxford/AstraZeneca and Johnson &amp; Johnson coronavirus vaccines and believe the jabs could be tweaked to stop the reaction happening altogether."
3027,"&gt;Rolf Marschalek, a professor at Goethe university in Frankfurt who has been leading studies into the rare condition since March, said his research showed the problem sat with the adenovirus vectors that both vaccines use to deliver the genetic instructions for the spike protein of the Sars-Cov-2 virus into the body."
3028,"&gt;The delivery mechanism means the vaccines send the DNA gene sequences of the spike protein into the cell nucleus rather than the cytosol fluid found inside the cell where the virus normally produces proteins, Prof Marschalek and other scientists said in a preprint paper released on Wednesday."
3029,You know this doesn’t apply to mRNA vaccines or attenuated vaccines either if that’s your option.
3030,I think that 'hoarding' angle is a bit hyped up media nonsense.
3031,Sure some people were hoarding supplies but I think the vast majority of people just wanted to do their shopping before the lockdown happened.
3032,"I know I went shopping just to get some drinks, meat and stuff like that so I didn't need to get out of the house over the weekend."
3033,Now imagine everyone doing this.
3034,"It would look like everyone has ransacked the supermarkets but the reality is that, supermarkets are not designed to cater to everyone at once."
3035,"Usually people shop on different days, all spread out, and supermarket trucks/stock come like a drip feed - instead of 20 deliveries at once."
3036,Just my 2cents.
3037,[deleted]
3038,That is exactly my point.
3039,"For a country, Australia and its cities are relatively sparsely-connected, even when including air travel, making inter-city travel much easier to regulate."
3040,I’m super cereal
3041,Maybe not if those countries keep up these measures forever.
3042,We were relying on AZ to vaccinate most of the population as it was going to be manufactured here in Melbourne.
3043,However it's now been advised to not do that as AZ has linkage to blood clots.
3044,"While over 50s can still get AZ, Pfizer is the recommended vaccine for under 50s."
3045,"So now that we have to order more Pfizer, we won't have enough to vaccinate the entire country until a shipment arrives in October at the earliest."
3046,Vaccines are still limited to over 50s (ages 40-49 have now been able to receive the Pfizer vaccine if they so wish from yesterday).
3047,Muddying the waters.
3048,For some reason some Brits on reddit decided that AZ was a matter of national pride for them and they will lie and derail discussions for that.
3049,You have chemists setup shop in the city like that?
3050,Do you go there with a request and they mix chemicals for you in test tubes with Bunsen burners and graduated cylinders?
3051,Most of us aren’t actually eligible for the vaccine yet.
3052,I’ll be getting it when I can.

3054,"Yes, it escaped their border controls and made it into the community."
3055,But it has done that and been eradicated multiple times already.
3056,"In Taiwan, New Zealand, Vietnam, Australia, etc."
3057,"Covid does not need to be endemic, it can be defeated."
3058,The world isn’t doomed to repeat covid-19 outbreaks for decades.
3059,I’m pro vaccine and think that the risk is low enough that people should still be getting them.
3060,But comparing it to birth control or any other risk is stupids and misses the point of most people that are cautious of or against vaccines.
3061,People take birth control pills for a reason.
3062,They want to have sex without risk of becoming pregnant or to help regulate hormones because of bad period experiences.
3063,People are willing to take a risk for some benefit.
3064,"If people don’t fear the virus, why would they take any risk to avoid getting sick from it?"
3065,There is no perceived benefit.
3066,At a certain age and case rate the balance may well shift.
3067,In the U.K. a healthy 30 year old woman is unlikely to die from the virus.
3068,"That may have been higher in January but now, the case rate is so low, hospitals are not at capacity and the general risk of hospitalisation is so low that the risk of dying from covid is very very low for that group."
3069,That’s true even those that agree the virus is dangerous and have been actively avoiding it as much as possible.
3070,The vaccine on the other hand is a terrible lottery.
3071,"No real precautions exist to avoid the hazard which, even though it is tiny, exists for that 30 year old woman."

3087,A person who returned from India tested positive to the Indian variant after leaving hotel quarantine in South Australia (contracted it while in hotel quarantine from a Covid-positive person in the next room over) and travelled home to Melbourne.
3088,This happened earlier in May.
3089,The next man to contract Covid (same strain as the SA person but we're still unsure how he got it from him) showed symptoms for around 6 days before finally deciding to get tested.
3090,In the meantime he went to work and other places outside his house.

3105,"&gt; It seems that the vax is not without risk, but more importantly it is very effective against a much greater risk."
3106,I don't agree with this generalization.
3107,"I don't agree with ""benefits outweigh the risks""."
3108,So as long as the vaccine causes 1 death less than COVID it is OK to ask everyone to take it?!
3109,Example.
3110,A person is 40 years old.
3111,She can do her work entirely from home.
3112,She can keep her distance.
3113,So her chance of getting COVID is virtually 0.
3114,"Why should she be ""forced"" to take AZ while there is an alternative?"
3115,It’s spreading in the community now in Taiwan.
3116,I’m starting to think it’s escaped their control.
3117,This is a joke.
3118,Can't believe I have to say this.
3119,"Very informative, thanks."
3120,Looks like supply shortages + poor logistics + hesitancy
3121,"To be fair, isn't that what it should be?"
3122,My wife’s work had like 40/250 people get the shot.. she one of them in December.
3123,Then just made it mandatory this week.
3124,My wife’s best friend is a traveling RN she was hesitant but her work made it mandatory.
3125,My work offered a extra vacation day and it changed a few peoples minds that were on the edge.
3126,And that’s the way we like it.
3127,Look at that... a chemist for all my chemical needs!
3128,I've read somewhere that Biontech has exclusive marketing rights for Germany and Turkey.
3129,"But that's confusing because Germany didn't buy any vaccines (other than Sputnik) directly from the manufacturer, we got everything through the EU – and I believe the EU bought doses from Pfizer, not Biontech?"
3130,"So maybe the answer is ""only Turkey deals directly with Biontech"", but I haven't looked into that."
3131,"China would deal with Fosun (and will claim that Taiwan needs to buy through Fosun, too)."
3132,And the rest of the world needs to buy from Pfizer.
3133,That's my understanding but it's very superficial TBH.
3134,First world elitism.
3135,I rather be here in Australia thanks.
3136,[removed]
3137,I guess you are right in a sense.
3138,"But I was never scared of dying from covid, it never really crossed my mind."
3139,"For most in the younger age group, it’s just for solidarity and not having to wear a mask."

3148,If someone says they're going to the chemist it 99% of the time means they're going to buy their medication so I guess a scientific chemist would need to be clarified as such haha
3149,Exactly!
3150,People will take them if they know it’ll get them back to normal.
3151,"But they can’t just be shown a data sheet with cases dropping, they need incentives!"
3152,!
3153,A woman’s pubic region
3154,I only put it off because I have an autoimmune disorder and can’t get flu shots or tetanus shots but I’m sure COVID would be worse
3155,"I doubt it's that low, honestly."
3156,"Everywhere else in Europe reported around 1 in 75,000-100,000 wasn't it?"
3157,No reason to think the UK would be any different.
3158,"Still not an acceptable risk for me personally (hence why I waited a couple of weeks for Pfizer, much to the digress of my GP) but still very unlikely to cause you harm."
3159,"They should still offer everyone the choice though, not just under 40's, like they do in the USA."
3160,Must be nice being in a country that takes a deadly disease seriously.
3161,We in central Canada are now having our worst outbreak yet because of the pure laziness of our citizens.
3162,I’m fully vaccinated just recently and have been out indoors with no mask in crowded places.
3163,I feel fine.
3164,Vaccines work people!!
3165,!
3166,Hopefully things turn around for you guys.
3167,On both the vaccine and Olympics front.
3168,Shutting down!
3169,"Oh, so spending time every year since my kids were eligible getting them their flu vaccine shots, teaching them to wash their hands, teaching them how to control their coughs, teaching them that during cold and flu season that they shouldn't touch their head unless they've washed their hands, teaching them to wash their hands as soon as they get home, recommending the same when it came up in conversation with every parent in my social circle, everything except wearing the mask due to the social stigma at the time and not wanting them to get bullied for it, was all just a waste?"

3382,Bruh this is America and we’re opening the fucking schools next year what the fuck
3383,"Really unfortunate, she died trying to prevent something else from killing her."
3384,Is AZ really worth it with that risk?
3385,"Her age group, she would’ve handled covid quite fairly."
3386,In most cases local authorities are the best source of such data.
3387,Especially the local bodies that issue Death Certificate.
3388,"The challenge is the with mis-reporting the ""cause of death"" that is recorded in Death Certificates."
3389,Same case in China and America that later 're-reported' their COVID death figures
3390,"Partially, but the main issue is that the federal government botched their procurement plan."
3391,"This sub likes to deflect any criticism of any government's slow vaccine roll-out with ""but muh America hoarding vaccines"" instead of accepting counties like Australia have done terrible."
3392,It’s because they are asking for a solution which is impossible.
3393,There are no vaccines to administer.
3394,I got a text from my sister in our family group chat back in February that we should all “sign up” and I called it bullshit.
3395,It just seemed absurd and not reputable on the surface.
3396,"From the article:

&gt;	While Dr. B—which Massoumi says he is funding himself—does not charge either users or partners for its services, it now has at least 56 employees, including a team of 30 organizers, most with a background in politics."
3397,"In February it expanded even further, acquiring another waitlisting service, Vax Standby."
3398,"Hmm, seems like they’re building a spam list."
3399,Glad I got vaccinated and didn’t hand over my contact info to a shady company.
3400,"Things just take time, I think."
3401,"Lots gears in motion, I'm sure."
3402,Please define stochastic terrorism?
3403,I think also they dont have the sense of urgency since they have had such low cases this whole time.
3404,"Also I think the anti- vax misinformation campaign has hit the area, like it has much of the world."
3405,"Yep, so don't give much heed to these type of stories."
3406,"Media can't resist them, but they frankly are not newsworthy on case-by-case basis."
3407,What happened with that?
3408,I thought you only had to quarantine for three days if you were vaccinated.
3409,This is an aspect of it that a lot of people don't realize or appreciate.
3410,"The first thought is always ""people who don't have the vaccine will just lie about it, they don't care and there's no way to tell"" which of course is true."
3411,But being allowed to take your mask off is not the only incentive here.
3412,"There's a more ""devious"" angle to it, which is that anyone who isn't immunized is now going to be surrounded by maskless, unrestricted anti-vax morons, who will be prime carriers of covid for many months or even years to come."
3413,"So if you're not vaccinated, your risk of catching it from an idiot just shot through the roof."
3414,"Obviously that's not going to make any true blue anti-vaxxers get the shot, but it's definitely going to make some lazy procrastinators step up and get it done."
3415,Supply is an issue also though
3416,"Yet the same vaccine hesitaters keep voting for our austerity party, which has rescinded financial support for those affected by the measures."
3417,Disproportionately younger people in insecure work who’ve sacrificed so much over the past year for members of the community other than themselves.
3418,"Once we’ve had supply and capacity to administer shots for everyone, we’ve got to open up and just let it rip on the hesitaters."
3419,"They made their bed, they should be made to lie in it."
3420,&gt; fully vaccinated people are 95% protected from hospitalization.
3421,What percentage of people are hospitalized without being vacinated?
3422,"One dose of ""the"" vaccine does not work at all well against B.1.617.2, and only 4.5% of Canadians have gotten a second dose."
3423,Canada is vulnerable just as the UK is.
3424,"It probably wasn’t intentional if true, more of a mess up."
3425,"The ramifications of a developed country releasing a virus on the world intentionally are not worth it (isolation, hard sanctions, and potentially war)."
3426,"My guess, due to the incubation period/mild cases in most people, people in the lab didn’t know they had it."
3427,"By December/January China has figured out where it came from, hence the massive response by them, unfortunately the disease had seeded elsewhere by then."
3428,"They are also backing waving patent rights

https://consumer.healthday.com/5-6-biden-administration-to-back-lifting-of-covid-vaccine-patents-2652896639.html"
3429,They use the same logic when it comes to abortions or gay weddings.
3430,"This is anecdotal, but my friend is a director at a large hospital in Los Angeles."
3431,They have 3 Covid patients right now.
3432,Just 3.
3433,"In January they had more like 300, with every bed full and ambulances being turned away at the door."
3434,"You can try to nit pick that however you want, but it's a fucking 99% improvement."
3435,"I really don't understand all the people who were saying ""it's not so bad"" while the rates were spiking up, and are now saying ""it's not that good"" while rates are plummeting."
3436,"Yes, it really was that bad back then, and yes it really is that good now."
3437,"We finally got our shit together, and hopefully we can get past this thing."
3438,[deleted]
3439,looks about right
3440,"Biden actually mentioned exactly that, that the whole world needs to get doses, so he's going to begin exporting it."

3442,Source?
3443,"If we posted about a single COVID death every day instead of the very few cases of vax-related complications, we'd be posting deaths past the year 10000."
3444,"I don’t have any ire to direct, and although I have plenty of anxiety in general this isn’t something I feel anxious about."
3445,"It’s super easy for me to just put on my mask when around strangers, it doesn’t bother me at all."
3446,It does bother me when others act like I need to justify it.
3447,I appreciate the well wishes.
3448,Keeping your dad safe is important.
3449,I haven’t seen my family since before this pandemic.
3450,It hurts.
3451,Couldn’t even get him to stand outside my window and wave when I had the chance.
3452,The pain is real.
3453,"If I had the chance, there is no way I would risk my father."
3454,I’d be grateful for the 48 hours at the tail end and cry tears of happiness.
3455,"But that’s me, I wouldn’t risk bringing him a new variant that I caught in transit."
3456,No way no how.
3457,Not a chance.
3458,So I don’t understand how COVID was “leaked from a lab”.
3459,Was the lab created in the virology center in Wuhan and then leaked?
3460,"I feel like even if this proves to be true, it wouldn’t have changed our response in the US."
3461,We would still be just as negligent and irresponsible.
3462,"I was just making an empathetic joke, I know it sucks."
3463,"I would suggest you direct your ire at the people making the policies where they get to charge you $30k for services not rendered (or whatever ridiculous cancellation fee) due to a positive asymptomatic vaccinated PCR test, rather than the 99.9965% of people around you who are not giving you COVID."
3464,"Look, I have people in my life who have anxiety, and I know for them it's not as easy as simply looking at a number or having someone rationalizing things at them."
3465,"I get it, to you it is a very real stressor that you are constantly being made aware of by the fact that it's still 70% of the news cycle and preconceived notions you've gathered living through this for the last year and 2 months."
3466,"I sincerely apologize if I came off as hostile in any way, I joke about things to let you know I am not attacking you and I was hoping showing the numbers could put you at ease."
3467,"Stress I'm sure plays a role in likelihood of conceiving, so any reduction in that should be welcomed."
3468,"I really do hope everything goes well for you this attempt, you don't let idiots like me get to you because we realize we might have been insensitive after we already said something with good intentions, and you and your family life long healthy lives with risks worth taking."
3469,Sounds great.
3470,I hope it means they have reached the peak and we keep seeing lower numbers from now on.
3471,They have suffered enough and their hospital staff deserve a break.
3472,"I agree with you, idk why you’re getting downvoted"
3473,"Someone else said only 3% is vaccinated so I won't bet on that happening in ""few months"" at this rate"
3474,"It’s also legal to do so now in, Florida, I think it is"
3475,[removed]
3476,I thought it was odd that the police and national guard were on patrol at the vaccination site.
3477,And now I know why
3478,That's ten times the cases they had last week.
3479,"So yes, it is concerning"
3480,Same.
3481,My wife and I both got the text at the same time after being fully vaccinated with no shortage of appointments.
3482,Whoa.
3483,I did not expect that.
3484,Is it matter of distribution?
3485,There were legit sources that have been saying this could have been a lab leak.
3486,It just went against the main stream group think.
3487,"With that said, it’s still probably 70-30 not a leak"
3488,Lately I see this weird thing where questions get downvoted here.
3489,Happened to me a few times as well.
3490,I have no idea why
3491,Yeah it’s funny how some people assume these lockdowns are going to keep happening.
3492,NZ went over 100 days.
3493,Thailand 99.
3494,Here in Vietnam we also went about three months.

3657,"The science is that kids are not able to get the vaccine yet, so without masks they have... let me check the numbers here... 0% resistance to the virus except what they might have if they've already had it or what they might get from safety measures like masks."
3658,And schools are a good place for viruses to spread.
3659,A lot of potential hosts in a small indoor space basically all day.
3660,"I'm not sure if you think you're being clever or something but while the virus doesn't tend to hurt kids as much, we still don't want to give it free reign to mutate."
3661,Kids should be masking until the vaccine is available to them.
3662,And now she has her 5 minutes of fame as her mug shot is spread across America
3663,Yasss.
3664,You're spot on.

3666,She's 100% those people who believe something because she saw other people sharing it.
3667,"Its on Facebook, it must be true!!"
3668,"No kidding she says stuff like ""I saw it on my phone so it isn't just me""."
3669,"Not sure when we started determining truth vs fact by whether or not your friends are posting it on fb, but here are."
3670,Is there a form or number to call to report a breakthrough covid case?
3671,Did it go up enough to offset the increase in spread caused by getting rid of mask mandates?
3672,It’s an experiment we will never really be able to conduct.
3673,Anything can happen.
3674,You got science and statistics or just conjecture
3675,Republicans are garbage
3676,Not for kids young enough to not be vaccinated.
3677,"They are one of the few populations left where this thing can spread and mutate, even if it doesn't hurt them in the process."
3678,Kids should be masking.
3679,Motive and intent are very hard to demonstrate without an extensive investigation.

3735,This sub has a far bigger problem with insane conspiracy theorists making it unusable than it does with news not getting reported.
3736,The other reply isn't wrong though.
3737,The actions taken by the Chinese government really kind of illustrate that it was accidental.
3738,"I know that the CCP was furious about the whole situation - several people in charge of Hubei province and the city of Wuhan were fired for blowing off the situation entirely, and the government worked like mad bees to contain COVID-19."
3739,"Any time that even 1 case was reported after they got a handle on COVID-19, and the Chinese officials were shitting bricks."
3740,"You have multiple cities in with millions of people, and those multiple cities with millions of people are hubs to at least one form of business or another, and if shit hit the fan in any of those cities, things would get out of hand globally."
3741,More than likely the reason that the claims weren't even acknowledged during the Trump administration is due to how disastrous Trump was with how he tackled the COVID pandemic.
3742,psychology and experience would suggest not.
3743,1 billion individual doses a month?
3744,Gotta double that again next month.
3745,While what China did was horrible and probably exacerbated things I doubt a few weeks would have helped in at least a majority of western countries given how none of em did anything until mid March.
3746,In the US senators traded stock while publicly downplaying the risk and then pretty much never put contract tracing in place anyways.
3747,The UK planned to say fuck it and roll with herd immunity when things first kicked off and Sweden actually did.
3748,Italy was already starting to be hit when it allowed its citizens to travel to biogen.
3749,There were still weeks if not months of inaction after China revealed the extent of the virus.
3750,This doesn’t even get into a discussion on if these governments could have even pulled off proper shutdowns in January—anyone even remotely liberal would have lost their shit if Trump closed the borders even in mid-February
3751,"Of course riskier, the same as playing soccer with big people is riskier because they can more easily injure you."
3752,If you're all vaccinated the level of risk is too low to care about.
3753,Good
3754,I jumped to get the vaccine first chance I got.
3755,My husband is waiting for full FDA approval.
3756,I inform him every 3 weeks when there is a vaccine clinic at the local community center.
3757,"He says ""Thank you for the information"" and moves on."
3758,"He wears his mask everywhere, only leaves the house when he needs to, stays (often more than) 6ft away from others, and continues to wash his hands more often than he ever used to."
3759,I am fully vaccinated and nothing I do or say will coerce or push him into it.
3760,To me the label is arbitrary (I mean I got J&amp;J for goodness sake!)
3761,but for him it is important.
3762,"As long as he is continuing to do everything else he can to stay safe, I will keep informing him of when and where the vaccine clinics are.😊"
3763,Not even sure.
3764,"They announced teachers were able to drive down to you guys, didn’t really hear much after that."

3784,How long had they been in the hospital ?
3785,"Haven't seen detail on this one, but my guess are cough, fever, loss of appetite, you know MOSTLY cold symptoms - it's bloody hard to tell covid symptoms from cold symptoms."
3786,Yeah I know you get weird covid symptoms like loss of smell but in 2019 most doctor will just think it's a weird one but no need to pay attention to.

3833,I took that as an example of something that would be dangerous if spreading unchecked.
3834,They didn't claim anyone actually posted that.
3835,"So the thing is, if there was a leak, there has to be accountability."
3836,Otherwise there's no incentive for them to ever change their behavior and we're all the more vulnerable to SARS v3.

3847,I would argue the origin is the most important piece of information to prevent another pandemic.
3848,While wet markets are definitely vectors the repercussions for the Chinese government are huge if it was to have leaked from a lab.
3849,If the CCP knew that there was a new virus that originated from the WIV in Oct/Nov and had informed the international community world governments could have responded faster similar to how we managed to control SARS in 03 and 04.
3850,Covering it up to save face may have cost 3.5m lives as there is much more ability to control and contact trace if you knew the origins were from a specific group of people.
3851,Best practices to prevent another one is to be honest from the beginning instead of lying to avoid consequences.
3852,All that crying.
3853,"😆

Why would anyone ""think"" that was a good idea to do?"
3854,I'm vaccinated but I still wear it.
3855,Before the masks I'd get the common cold yearly.
3856,"Since covid and masks started last March I haven't had a single case
I've gotten so used to it that I even started collecting different types and my friend she gets matching masks with her outfit
Masks aren't going anytime soon
And for shy people like me afraid of the Wal-Mart self checkout camera it's the ultimate way to hide your face"
3857,"True, but based on the data in this study and rate of infection in Israel and the US  it doesn't seem to be that low."
3858,&gt; But that's it.
3859,We have to wait for more reliable results.
3860,Is anyone actually studying this?
3861,Didn't the CDC just say they weren't even going to track mild infections anymore?
3862,If someone is actually studying this they'd have to PCR test all the participants once a week.
3863,"From the article   ""There were more than a dozen people working inside that tent, and Deputy Snider said several of them ran up to his patrol car and told him that the SUV almost hit several people under the tent. """

3866,"My wife and I have been fully vaxxed for over a month, but schools here have ditched masks and my son has already had several cases in his class."
3867,He continues to wear a mask (his choice) but this spread in schools when we were so close to the end of the near is maddening.
3868,"She told me her doctor had side effects where ""he thought he was going to die but not really"" for a week."
3869,I'm half inclined to think people are making up stuff.
3870,"It rarely happens, and everyone gets over it like they do the flu shot unless they are a 1 in a million brain blood clot person."
3871,"It could also be 66%, in which case I wouldn't speak of ""highly effevtive"" anymore."
3872,The point is: we don't know.

3882,My comment was joking about that.
3883,"Lighten up, champ."
3884,?
3885,"Not necessarily, as people who haven't been hospitalized can also develop long-term symptoms."
3886,The CDC says you don't need to quarantine or get tested after coming in contact with an infected person if you're vaccinated.
3887,It would of course lower your risk if you feel it's necessary but odds are you either won't be infected or your symptoms will be minor.
3888,What are flu seasons like in AZ?

3950,At least safe enough that I can be around a population that's 50/50 vaccinated.
3951,"Now I might wear a mask in crowded conditions to be on the safe side (or because I have PTSD, who can tell?"
3952,).
3953,My vaccinated girlfriend just tested positive positive COVID.

3955,I assume we should separate from eachother for the time being?
3956,"We've been sleeping together every day, and I'm going to get tested tomorrow or Saturday."
3957,I have no symptoms but she's at a 101.3 fever already.
3958,"Don't really know what to do here, don't want to get infected but I think its probably already happened... really hoping this isn't some new variant and that she is just the unlucky few who got a breakthrough case."
3959,Definitely glad I kept wearing a mask around even though I'm vaccinated.
3960,Wish others did too though or maybe we wouldn't be in this situation 😕

3971,I’m in Arkansas it’s run of the mill over here.
3972,To restate what I thought was obvious since some people were confused who came up with this idea.
3973,The covid vaccine lotteries weren't the federal government's idea.
3974,In fact the federal government just gave approval this week to the idea after the fact.
3975,It wasn't the fed's idea given to the states.
3976,So I'll say it again: **I wish the Federal Government would do the same thing.
3977,** We need a national covid vaccine lottery because the **state ideas'** to do so are successful.

4012,"‘researchers found that fully immunized participants were 25 times less likely to test positive for COVID-19 than were those who were unvaccinated...’

‘people who tested positive for COVID-19 after getting just their first vaccine dose had lower levels of virus in their bodies than unvaccinated people who tested positive."
4013,The researchers believe the decreased viral load hints that vaccinated people who do contract the virus will be less infectious because they will have much less virus that could be spread to others.
4014,A preprint study which has not yet been peer-reviewed suggests that the Moderna mRNA COVID-19 vaccine can produce coronavirus-fighting antibodies in the oral and nasal fluid.
4015,"Since that’s where SARS-CoV-2 makes its entry, antibodies in the mouth and nose should block the virus from getting into the body, effectively providing “sterilizing immunity.” This would also mean vaccinated people probably wouldn’t spread the virus through respiratory droplets."
4016,These bits of evidence are promising.

4211,You’re doing what you think is best for your kids and that’s commendable.
4212,Some children have been in school in person for the entirety of the school year.
4213,"As a parent, you have to weigh risk vs reward to decide what’s best for your children, and you’re already doing that."

Not that this makes what you’re saying untrue, but that’s a pretty significant difference in numbers."

4223,How the tables have turned.
4224,Isn't CNN mainstream media?
4225,"Hey now, only 3.5 MILLION deaths recorded so far."
4226,Only the uninformed were praising Taiwan for its testing.
4227,Reluctance to test has been a persistent criticism for Taiwan since the very beginning.
4228,eg.
4229,"There was a massive controversy last year where an independent effort to randomly test a city was being blocked by the CECC, ostensibly out of fear of there being false positives."
4230,They eventually revealed the result of the test but CECC has pushed back against broader testing the entire time.

4348,"Does it, though?"
4349,"If 18 of those 19 people who tested positive have NO symptoms (again, they didn't say) then 1 case of symptomatic infection is on par with the vaccine."
4350,It could definitely mean that the body is creating immunity as it should.
4351,I don't think I've seen anywhere that said that you can't *test positive* after either the vaccine or previous infection.
4352,This study is jumping the gun.
4353,"There's quite a few reasons why someone with immunity might return a positive test, and it doesn't necessarily mean that they are infected *or* contagious."
4354,"Having said that, YES, still get the vaccine."
4355,The studies on people who have had covid *plus* the vaccine are looking like it gives you a very robust immunity that even 2 doses without previous infection can give you.
4356,I just don't buy that there are many people out there getting reinfected with symptoms who have had covid.
4357,Can you get vaccinated?
4358,"If not, why not?"
4359,"&gt; They just opened up and they're not doing that well

In comparison to who, the previous weeks in the UK?"
4360,The rise in cases isn't unexpected given the indian variant and the easing of other restrictions.
4361,"According to [this chart](https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/biweekly-covid-cases-per-million-people?tab=chart&amp;country=ESP~GBR~FRA~DEU~ITA~USA~CAN) the UK has less cases per million than those countries, and by quite a distance."
4362,The restrictions from France/Austria/Germany is to limit the spread of the Indian variant within their own countries.
4363,Fomite transmission of flu has been known to be a huge vector for years now.
4364,Surface cleaning and hand washing are absolutely our best defenses against flu.
4365,No one loves lockdowns.
4366,It's either that or you risk getting an uncontrolled outbreak like India where this variant came from.
4367,"You watch way too much TLC, it’ll rot your brain"
4368,"&gt; lesser focus on cases (as opposed to hospitalizations and deaths)

Why?"
4369,"In countries with high vaccination rates cases are dropping  faster than deaths, at similar level as hospitalizations."
4370,"Welp, time to get covid then"
4371,I'm convinced that 99% of the people who say they're uncomfortable with the EUA and are waiting for full approval have no intention of ever getting vaccinated.
4372,They just don't want to come off as an anti-vaxxer and are at least a little bit self-aware.
4373,They do the same thing with children's vaccines.
4374,They supposedly are pro-vaccine but are just concerned about the schedule or think there are too many.

4381,"Our federal government forgot to buy vaccines, and when the AZ vaccine was shown to have issues with blood clots, they blamed the population for ""vaccine hesitancy"" after they were the ones pushing that issue."

4383,"The New Years Bushfires last year, the Ruby Princess and the vaccine rollout, all they do is stand by with their thumbs in their arseholes doing fucking nothing."
4384,If someone wants to send us some more Pfizer then we will get that rate up pretty quickly.
4385,Worth noting other countries had a head start on their rollout due to emergency use.
4386,We didn't have the same emergency at the time.

4397,Some day there will be a mutation that allows it to be reliably transmitted on groceries and we'll all be fucked.
4398,"The ""rich"" countries raised 8 billion dollars last May to buy vaccine for poor countries under the Covax scheme."
4399,The SII was supposed to supply much of those vaccines - until the Indian export ban.

4404,"Also, obviously the situation is much more critical in large cities than villages."
4405,So who exactly is chasing people in this village that even in that blurry photo the don't look like elderly/frail to me or jumping into rivers.
4406,Calling BS and that's what it clearly is
4407,"This is what Philadelphia looked like a year ago last March, and my brother in a rural Midwestern town still thinks I'm exaggerating since where he is there's never been any restrictions and nobody has ever felt the need to wear a mask."

4420,"The masks certainly didn’t *hurt,* but they’re not the biggest reason we had very little flu last year."
4421,"We also closed a lot of schools, which are a huge flu reservoir, stood further apart from other people, increased cleaning of frequently touched surfaces, got frequently reminded to wash our hands and not touch our faces, stayed home whenever possible, didn’t go to concerts, museums, and other public gatherings, and a significant portion of people worked from home."
4422,"Unlike Covid, you *can* catch flu from a door handle."
4423,Fomite transmission of flu is probably more common than droplet/aerosol transmission.
4424,"By all means, wear a mask during flu season."

4432,I mean yes.
4433,People died and that sucks.
4434,In my country (Scotland) the majority of those that died were suffering from ore existing conditions or have had many other deaths with a positive COVID test attributed as COVID when that was not the case.
4435,So the numbers are certainly skewed.
4436,We can just leave that point as it gets argued and discussed to deaths and peoples opinions on it are set.
4437,"But yes, the complete acceptance of Lockdowns when we are past the worst of this is scary."

4519,This was probably the main reason for the lockdown as they did not know how many he could've potentially infected at those bars he attended.
4520,Also about 50% of patrons who attended these restaurants/bars did not check-in via our QR check-in system.
4521,Our QR check-in system is basically to help with contact tracing in the event of an outbreak... like now.
4522,"It does matter, lives matter."
4523,The number of people dead is determined by how many of your population are exposed to the virus and how long it takes to get everybody vaccinated.
4524,"In an ideal situation, a country would both reduce cases to near zero and vaccinate almost everybody, so that the total number of deaths can be in the single digits per millions."
4525,We didn't have the ability to produce mRNA vaccine here.
4526,CSL could however do the Oxford Vax.
4527,"We are going to build mRNA production facilities, takes time."
4528,Taiwan also is nearby.
4529,"Meanwhile in Manitoba, Canada the malls are open with 300-600+ new cases daily ."

4532,Teachers under 50 in Aust don't get it before anyone else.
4533,We're only essential when it's convenient.
4534,"On the other hand, I do get a free flu vaccine every year and nurses even come to the school to deliver it."
4535,So that's nice.
4536,I actually don't know if that happens at all public schools though.
4537,I think it's either state or council organized and the covid-19 vaccinations are federal.
4538,And they have fubar-ed it up soooooo bad.
4539,Yes because it’s exactly what happened.
4540,We had no local case outbreaks in Australia for months.
4541,Once we are vaccinated they won’t be necessary but at the moment such a low percentage of the population is vaccinated that if we let covid run unchecked it would result in another full blown wave.
4542,Literally organizing a 4some.
4543,"I think it depends on how you measure it, but yea, I was being conservative."
4544,We just hit the any key and let the cases roll.

4598,You can down vote all you want but the truth is India and most companies in India are more interested in technology transfers and making juicy deals with manufacturers from abroad (and then selling these vaccines to highest bidders) than vaccinating their own people.
4599,The EU smear campaign didn't help though.
4600,Wouldn’t they get vaccinated in their home countries before traveling to Japan?

4607,It's not so much.
4608,To lockdown when (I didn't realise it was Victoria not just Melbourne so the actual percentage is 0.0005837%)  is absolutely ludicrous.

4637,I have my appointment for Pfizer at Olympic Park and I'm 25 – just go through the pre-registration and they'll give you a date.
4638,There were actually so many available appointments.
4639,Most likely they would if they had the doses.
4640,Even the most vaccine-hesitant states in the US did that.
4641,"Start by offering the vaccine to the most vulnerable, and once supply exceeds demand, expand the pool to the next group."

4651,I hope vaccinations jump soon.
4652,isolation and rotating lockdowns is not a good long term strategy.
4653,The problem is with how the contracts are worded with the in America produced vaccines.

4683,Those people seeking out those tests might be a portion of population in whom the vaccine may not be effective.
4684,You have to have a good reason to get a spike protein antibody test right now since doctors are not ordering them and you have to do it against medical advice since the test is not yet approved by the FDA.
4685,"I take an immunosuppressive drug called Methotrexate for my Crohn's Disease and apparently only 62% of individuals taking it develop ""adequate"" antibodies which many developing no antibodies at all."

4763,Yes because it wasn’t a lockdown.
4764,Okay.
4765,Looks like people in Australia are following rules better and looks like the US has almost one hundred times as many cases per capita and more than twelve times the number of deaths per capita.

4818,Are they entering every NY resident who is vaccinated or just rewarding the people who didn’t do the right thing to begin with?
4819,Australian's overally have been generally ok with the way the government run things for them and making decisions like this during the pandemic.
4820,"Also Melbourne went through a massive lockdown last year to go from 800-900 cases/day to zero, so I think there is at least some acceptance there to pursue covid-0 and getting back to a normal way of life shortly."
4821,"If they opened up now with their low vaccine rates things would go to hell pretty quickly and a lot of people would get infected and some would then die, so the approach they take is one that can be justified."
4822,"I know a couple of people in their early 20s who've had it, probably depends on the vaccination centre?"
4823,"Dunno (shrug)

But yeah, they all had to approve the risk."
4824,They went with AZ because they wanted to give business to CSL.
4825,Did you get the booster firmware upgrade?
4826,I was thinking about this the other day.
4827,Australia and New Zealand have to do a lot better with vaccinations than most other countries because they've had so few cases in the wild.
4828,"It's going to take a lot more for them to get to heard immunity than say the US, Italy or the UK."
4829,Could a switch to the Canadian strategy of prioritising first doses speed things up?
4830,Did you get the firmware upgrade that is required one month after receiving the first vaccine installation?

4835,"I’m sorry, that sucks."
4836,I think they did it because the cases at schools were undeniable and they didn’t want to shut schools completely again.

4844,They said they plan to submit for approval in Sept(assuming the trial is complete by then) and I expect the approval process to be more heavily scrutinized.
4845,The 12-15 EUA for Pfizer took 1 month from submission and I expect the under 12 to have a longer approval time.

5210,I live in 3rd world country in southeast asia.
5211,"I’m going to get mine in July (AZ, pfizer or sinovac)."
5212,I ask this because i thought modern countries like in EU would vaccinate faster than us.
5213,What are you even trying to argue lmao
5214,Wow this is interesting.
5215,I thought immunity doesn’t last forever?
5216,Am I wrong in thinking this way because of the various flu strains that circulate annually?

5222,But state fairs do make for quintessential date opportunities.
5223,I don’t believe the vaccines were available to that age group when the metric was created
5224,"I see what you mean, but the crux of the issue is whether the people being denied service are protected (or should be) by some sort of anti-discrimination laws."
5225,I think most people would agree that refusing to vaccinate doesn't (and shouldn't) land you into a protected class.
5226,see here in America we believe in personal freedom to keep our info private from the government.
5227,"We also believe in a few megacorps having all our info in a way we can't opt out of, and then they occasionally have data breaches and well that is life."
5228,but there being a government file on me and my choices is communism!
5229,Why do vaccinated people care if someone does not have their shot?
5230,The vaccinated person is protected are they not?
5231,You cant convince me mankind cares so much about strangers that they are worried about someone they have never mets health.

5253,Even some healthcare systems don't mandate them.
5254,Sorry I didn’t mean to be condescending.
5255,That wasn’t my intention.
5256,Good luck getting home.
5257,All the adults getting vaccinated is cutting back a major reservoir of the disease.
5258,Children under 12 don't have quite the same level of mobility as adults thus the chain of contagion is perhaps more manageable.
5259,I’m just needing a discount chemist!
5260,!
5261,Some people can't take the vaccine due to medical issues (like allergies).

5291,Don't you love it when stupid people proudly show off their stupidity?
5292,"When it came to vaccinations, at least."
5293,"The whole New England region made a lot of mistakes early on in the pandemic, it's true."
5294,Because you aren't asking them to divulge actually protected information because the vaccine provider like a clinic asked those questions.
5295,The vaccine is a yes/no answer that doesn't divulge anything else about you.
5296,"To be fair, the experts didn't really start giving any real advice until most of those deaths had already happened"
5297,Just curious; some people can't take vaccines for various reasons (like allergies).
5298,"You believe charging those people more is ethical, moral, and how the free market should operate?"
5299,I'd bet a hundred bucks that MA isn't at 70% in three weeks.
5300,There's a big problem with people getting dose one and then not getting their second dose.
5301,Take a look at the number of people getting vaccinated each week and compare it to the numbers that haven't had their second dose.
5302,You'll see the issue.

5305,I know a guy who lost his OPT because he went back home when the pandemic was starting.
5306,Definitely messed up a lot of people’s plans.
5307,"This may be true when you look at the 40-49 group overall, but there's a lot of variation in individual covid risk (I'd wager that a lot of those deaths among women in their 40s come from a narrow section of the population)."
5308,An obese person with multiple health problems who has extended indoor contact with lots of strangers will be at much greater risk from the virus than someone in perfect health who lives alone and works from home.
5309,"For someone in the former group, the AZ vaccine is a much better choice than being unvaccinated."
5310,"For someone in the latter group, it isn't."
5311,He personally has zero to do with it.. A lot of people behind him have eveything to do with it.
5312,He's proposing spending like the government is gonna be making $1k/dose hah.
5313,We're fucked over here don't think too highly of us.
5314,"Combine that with a low percentage of civilians carrying antibodies due to contracting the virus and new more contagious variants spreading globally, Australia is in trouble."
5315,"I'm from Western Australia and we have been told even if we are all vaccinated the premiere won't open the borders up anyway, we have 0 incentive to get it."
5316,"There has been more jobs in W.A since the borders have been closed both nationally and internationally then before hand, so for some it seems like we r better off, though our housing market has turned to shit for renters."
5317,"There are hypothesis (see other responses) as to why this is happening, but we do not know anything for sure yet"
5318,This is a non-problem.
5319,It involves several dozen people jumping the queue.
5320,"In total, 8,6 **million** vaccinations have been given."
5321,"Don't get me wrong, jumping the queue is abhorrent and selfish, but a two-digit number of people jumping the queue is basically expected when you look at the amount of people getting vaccinated."
5322,"In fact, it's even lower than I thought it would be."
5323,"My fear is that older people will look at this news and conclude that young people are the reason why we're 'only' now vaccinating people born in 1972-3, when that is very much not the case."
5324,"The real and only limiting factor is the supply of vaccines, not a negligible amount of people jumping the queue."
5325,We do have a sense of urgency our PM and cabinet are just a bunch of assholes.
5326,"&gt; No other country in the world is going through a 3rd party

5329,"I chose to be vaccinated…however, I believe ppl should have a right to abstain from being inoculated."
5330,I don’t judge and honestly it’s not my place to.
5331,"Also, not everyone who’s on the fence of the vaccine is ‘anti vax’ or believe it’ll sterilize them."
5332,"Take care of yourself and let others be, it’s not their responsibility to get the vaccine for us."
5333,"I’m vaccinated and happy…I pray everyone stays safe and healthy, regardless of stance."
5334,"We are, we have a relatively decent vaccine program but the government are being super careful regarding the Astro Zeneca vaccine after the blood clot info came to light."
5335,This lockdown won’t do anything except stop transmission before it bloats up to ridiculous amounts in a matter of days like our second wave did.
5336,its not because its on the coast.
5337,It gets much colder inland where I am
5338,"Yeah, sorry you’re right."
5339,Vic has had a very different experience to a lot of Australia.
5340,It was a bit of an unfair comment.
5341,I live in Germany but am from WA and would speak to family members who were going to weddings and living a normal life.
5342,It seemed so bizarre from where I was but I was happy for them.
5343,I know Vic and NSW have had a much harder time.
5344,WA had its whole “island within an island” thing going on.
5345,"When you have the desert on one side, ocean on the other and a whole lot of nothing in between, it’s a different story."
5346,"Well the people of Japan are being pretty vocal and asking to either delay another year, or to just cancel the games completely."
5347,Tourism as you said is completely out.
5348,"However athletes, trainers, staff and so on are permitted so they intend to televise the entire thing without guests."
5349,Word is still out on residents/locals.
5350,"However that is still about 90,000 people from around the world coming to a place where as of now, about 5% of the population has gotten a single dose of the vaccine."
5351,"When the warnings about blood clots with the A.Z vaccine came to light, our government stopped people under 50 from getting vaccinated in order to focus on higher risk folks."
5352,It’s been lowered to 40 now.
5353,"7 day lockdown but it’s a relatively mild lockdown, it’ll stop the chain of transmission and give them more time to seek out infections just like the last snap lockdown did here."
5354,"Yep, the states went hard."
5355,"The feds shitcanned the states and did nothing, then took credit for any success the states had."
5356,I am an American in the UK.
5357,There isn't that much transmission of the virus in the UK at all compared with the US right now (and the US is doing sooo much better).
5358,"As for Germany, France and Austria, I feel a hack of a lot safer in the UK than I would in those countries."
5359,"The government brought in a JobKeeper program for stood down workers, they got $1500 a fortnight for about 9 months of last year."
5360,"The big annoyance with this lockdown is that it’s mainly due to someone with COVID who had symptoms for a week before getting tested and isolating, and went about their business during that time spreading it."
5361,"He’s also over 50, so has been eligible to be vaccinated for quite a while, which may have greatly reduced or eliminated the spread."
5362,Bloody dickhead.
5363,Are yall lacking vaccines?
5364,Thanks.
5365,I'm in Queensland and our lockdowns have pretty much been the same.
5366,Essential workers were allowed to go to work unless they could work from home.
5367,Essential workers were classed as basically anyone who still had a job lol.
5368,Also actual essential workers who have been amazing.
5369,Tasmania doesn't exist
5370,i get that but aus is at 3% whereas the usa is at like 40% fully vaccinated so although anti vaxxers are an issue I don't think it's one of the bigger problems
5371,"Our own government has shut down it's website where you could see your vaccination date because of the delivery woes, for Pfizer deliveries are uncertain for 153000 out of a total of 755000 doses next week and the next 4 weeks."
5372,Florida has quite literally made it legal to run over protesters “if you feel frightened”.
5373,"Simultaneously, they also define three or more people gathered together as meeting the criteria of a riot"
5374,Tasmania is colder.
5375,12 and older.
5376,My 16 year old has had both shots and my 14 year old was able to get her first shot last week
5377,"Just to  clarify, 5 million Victorians had a 112-day stage 4 lockdown last year."
5378,"That wasn't a small lockdown, but it did reduce our numbers from hundreds a day to 0."
5379,And we were all under lockdowns of various stages outside of that period.
5380,"It's been with recent, small outbreaks that we've introduced short ""circuit-breaker"" lockdowns."
5381,Well yeah but liberals got Seuss.
5382,So like...
5383,Murder is okay?
5384,Yeah.
5385,They're dogshit humans.
5386,Exactly.
5387,"My parents got the vaccine, but none of their friends want to."
5388,You could literally walk in to a vaccine centre without appointment and get jabbed.
5389,"No queues, etc."
5390,But uptake had been super low.
5391,That's probably going to change now with this outbreak...

5394,"I guess you should get help before you get the massive headache (or abdominal pain), but it's impossible to know your situation is worsening before that happens."
5395,It's to give them a break because the numbers grow exponentially.
5396,If you don't go onto lockdown then the contract tracing gets to the point where it's impossible.
5397,And you end up like America.
5398,The break is to give the contract tracers time to catch up and get through all people so all sites are known.
5399,If a person they haven't contact yet goes to 20 places then that's 200+ more people added to the list.
5400,"My point is the data was and is fine,  


That's why regulators including the european medicines agency (EMA) recommended AZ for all age groups from the start."

&gt; EMA has recommended granting a conditional marketing authorisation for COVID-19 Vaccine AstraZeneca to prevent coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in people from 18 years of age."
5402,It was just some (not all) individual health regulators from european countries who decided to diverge from the european regulators opinion.
5403,Looking at the deaths per day in most of europe I'm not convinced it was the correct move.
5404,"Well, hopefully she changes her mind on that vaccine in county lockup, because the transmission rate in jails is pretty bad."

5414,But being so close to a successful vaccine rollout I just don't get why we can't be forced into another 2 months of quite strict rules/lockdowns.

5416,Yesterday there were 49 hospitalisations in the Bolton hospital alone.

5418,It will be open again in a week lol... and our lives will be essentially normal.
5419,Better than months of pandemic
5420,The lockdown was to give contact tracers a break??
5421,Are you fucking kidding me?
5422,What is wrong with that country/state?
5423,"So lock how many million people in their homes and deprive them if their ability to earn a living plus billions in economic damages because... the contact tracers were tired, is that seriously what they said?"
5424,Aside of shutting off borders and stopping it's own citizens returning or leaving without a government permit in line with NZ and north Korea.
5425,Not much !
5426,They can't even manage the god damn qurantine system hence there's these outbreaks.
5427,It's a big country.
5428,Why can't they get it right ?
5429,And they couldn't get proper a proper vaccination program despite how wealthy the country is.
5430,"What a fucking joke 

Then they brainwashed Australia to think 1 case or covid is not ok though in 2019 some 800 plus Aussies died from the flu."

5454,"The lack of comprehension that letting the virus spread uncontrolled in places like India could result in a mutation that not only renders current vaccines less effective, or non effective, is the concerning part."
5455,Manchester in the UK is already seeing the Indian double variant spread there.
5456,It's also possible that it mutates to a more lethal version.
5457,"If there was ever a good reason to override patent protection laws, this is it."
5458,"State vs fed goverments... feds do vax, states everything else"
5459,"Serious question, if Japan (the government) is currently banning all tourism, how would they die trying to force the Olympics through?"
5460,I see no signs of Japan letting up on travel bans anytime soon.
5461,I just assumed the Olympics would be televised only without spectator's in person.
5462,How do you pay rent or mortgage without working for 6 months ?
5463,My personal theory is that some people want to think the pandemic is over and resist any implications that it’s not - whether it’s news articles or questions.
5464,"True, Melbourne has had a different experience to a lot of the country."
5465,NSW also had a few longer lockdowns if I’m not mistaken.
5466,Always harder with higher population density.
5467,"Very few people dies from it, mostly old people with pre existing conditions."
5468,"If Australia/New Zealand hasn't started vaccinating them yet it is a huge issue, and they probably should change leaders if they are too incompetent to order vaccines."
5469,In Finland one of our leading doctors said we probably have given up our rights too easily.
5470,I understand there needs to be some restrictions but there are many sides of the problem.
5471,"The restrictions should prevent the hospitals from being overcrowded, not prevent the virus all together."
5472,"It is still worth remembering that for most people corona is like a flu, even though the media tells you otherwise."
5473,[removed]
5474,"But the average australian hasnt, because we took the hit"
5475,Parents aren't testing kids anymore to keep from being blamed for an outbreak.
5476,Maybe this is a hot take but I feel like these headlines are dangerous and unproductive right now.
5477,"It's very understandable that they need to investigate the ""leaked by China"" theory but reporting it in this way is only going to exacerbate the trend of racism/xenophobia against Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders (AAPI) and IMHO these ""OoOo CoNsPiRaCy"" headlines are going to get people killed."
5478,Any reasonable person knows that a) the lab leak theory is not highly likely and b) AAPI have *literally no control over China.
5479,* Not everyone is reasonable and someone is going to see this and use it as justification to commit hate crimes.
5480,Frankly I think this is one of the few situations where it would make sense for the government to burry reports of China's wrong doing until the situation has calmed down and making them public won't put Americans at risk.
5481,"This may be a gray zone but anything other than a hard line of ""No this didn't happen"" is going to result in harm and it would be unethical to not consider this."
5482,We had that as well in Melbourne
5483,option  2 relies on the vaccinated population receiving an effective vaccine.
5484,[See: Seychelles](https://www.abc.net.au/news/2021-05-20/covid-surging-in-seychelles-worlds-most-vaccinated-country-why/100151306)
5485,"If he had low blood platelet levels, that would be very strong evidence."
5486,It's easy to have a blood test done.
5487,Are we talking about Japanese people?
5488,Then yes.
5489,If it is the Japanese government then no.
5490,They are going to force the Olympics through or die trying.
5491,It is mild.
5492,Melbourne had the worst Australian outbreak about 12 months ago (Jul-Aug).
5493,Melbourne's climate and population density clearly makes it suitable for another outbreak.
5494,Meanwhile the Netherlands is back to 3000 a day and we are opening up again.
5495,I'm sorry but this is just ridiculous.
5496,Vaccinate your God damn population.
5497,I don’t know about the UK.
5498,They were very slow with lockdowns to start with.
5499,I live in Hamburg.
5500,We’re just coming out of 6 month lockdown.
5501,"Spain, Italy and France all had a pretty tough time too."
5502,I think it’s great that Aus is doing short sharp lockdowns before the numbers get out of hand.
5503,Here’s hoping for vaccines soon though.
5504,"I think Aus has handled everything quite well, but they seem quite far behind the curve in terms of vaccinations; I hope their vax timelines are shaped by science and not complacence."
5505,US is at almost 2K deaths per million people and that number can only go up (because math).
5506,NZ is at 26 deaths total.
5507,"To reach US deaths per million about another 10,000 people would have to die."
5508,"Aus is at around 900 deaths so lets say around 50,000 more deaths needed."
5509,Given the exponential growth seen everywhere else these numbers would be pretty easy to achieve.
5510,"I am not sure how to value lives but I feel like ""more harm"" would have to fairly significant."
5511,And that is just to hit the current stats of the US where the problem is not yet solved.

5536,&gt;TOKYO — Japan is set to extend a coronavirus state of emergency in Tokyo and other areas with infections not yet slowing to levels it can safely host the Olympics opening in just over 50 days.
5537,"&gt;The extension is needed as people are increasingly roaming in public, especially in Tokyo and Osaka, when they should be doing the opposite, and it’s feared that lifting the emergency would cause an instant rebound in infections, Economy Revitalization Minister Yasutoshi Nishimura said."
5538,"&gt;The current emergency in the capital and eight other metropolitan areas was to end next Monday, but hospitals in some areas are still overflowing with COVID-19 patients and serious cases hit new highs recently."
5539,&gt;Nishimura told reporters the government proposal of a 20-day extension to June 20 in the nine areas received preliminary approval from experts ahead of an official announcement later Friday.
5540,The southern island prefecture of Okinawa is already under emergency status through June 20.
5541,"&gt;Olympic organizers have to decide around that date whether to allow any fans at all, after overseas spectators were banned months ago."
5542,"A plan to prioritize vaccinations for Japanese athletes also is being delayed to around that time, according to media reports."
5543,"&gt;The Olympics are scheduled to start on July 23 after a one-year postponement due to the pandemic, and worries about the new variants and Japan’s slow vaccination rollouts have triggered calls from the public and medical experts to cancel the Games."
5544,"&gt;Experts have warned that more contagious variants are infecting more people, leaving them seriously ill and flooding hospitals."
5545,"&gt;Meanwhile, Japan has lagged on vaccinations due to bureaucratic and planning missteps and shortages."
5546,"Only 2.3% of the population has been fully vaccinated, and the current phase targeting older adults is not scheduled to finish before the Games."
5547,"&gt;Still, Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga and his government are determined to host the Olympics."
5548,The International Olympic Committee has also said the Olympics would go ahead even if the host city Tokyo is under emergency measures.
5549,"&gt;Japan has reported about 730,000 cases of infection and more than 12,700 deaths."
5550,Gotta exclude fucking prisoners again.
5551,I was just going by [this](https://www.statista.com/chart/24555/vaccine-doses-produced-and-exported/).
5552,Strip clubs.
5553,They call it “tea houses” there.
5554,Probably no one is willing to admit they went to one so I imagine contact tracing is… difficult.
5555,"This isn’t fair people have to risk dying from the vaccine or Covid , its so messed up."
5556,"Unemployment, mental health issues, suicides etc."
5557,"We have lived with the virus a year, maybe some countries should learn to deal with it instead of locking down the entire society when  1 case appears, and fucking up the future of younger generations."
5558,For a population of 5.078 million 0.0007680189050807404% having COVID seems a tad ridiculous to shut down a while economy and effect everyone else.
5559,"They will produce most of the vaccine on foreign facilities, and many of them like the one in Brazil or India are only starting now to produce it, so the capicity will increase heavily."
5560,Norwegian doctors have said that the problem is that the symptoms can come so fast that it’s very hard to stop it before it become a serious and potentially lethal situation.
5561,The EU has most likely exported more than 270 million doses so far
5562,you're as close to a post-pandemic new normal as you're ever going to get
5563,My understanding is Japan wants the Olympics canceled.
5564,"My wife bought tickets to Japan in September but it's not looking like Japan will allow tourists for a long while according to the Japanese consulate we spoke too, worst case we fly next year."
5565,Boris and a rise in cases is a tough one to connect.
5566,"Britain is tiny and packed to the rafters with people, in a country where the culture is to sit face to face with another person in a tiny room and drink, because the weather outside is shit."
5567,The fact of the matter is that controlling any contagion on the island is damn near impossible.
5568,I still don’t understand why articles about India’s coronavirus pandemic are routinely downvoted.
5569,Add in China’s internet.
5570,Update your statistics lol
5571,I’m not quite sure what you’re referring to with regards to Boris doing the same thing over and over?
5572,What would do you have him do if you had his ear?
5573,"sorry, now is it all the way upto..... 2%?"
5574,Yeah its good for the smaller scale issues.
5575,Its not working on anything that the fed level controls unfortunately.
5576,We have some kind of media/industry capture of politics happening where it makes more sense for feds to do nothing than e.g.
5577,"get us vaccinated, set up better quarantine facilities, improve fire services or act on climate change."
5578,No mater how much thise things actually effect people.
5579,States cant really do these things without the fed $$
5580,"Based on my mom and her friends who are over 50, the fact that none of them want to get it because the media has made them fear the vaccine so much, it’s slow."
5581,"I’m sure if they offered them some $ they would, but right now...none of them want to touch astra v with a ten foot pole 

Not even my mom not seeing her grandchild for almost 2 years is an incentive to get it."
5582,I mean this is the country that literally a hair salon posted on their SM saying if you have had the vaccine you are not welcome in their salon.
5583,And majority of the comments were supporting them.
5584,I believe it’s because they haven’t been hit hard and seen death like we have in the states.
5585,"I hope they get it soon, I want to go back to see my family."
5586,I’ve already missed my grandpas funeral.
5587,"It’s not like my mom can come over here, the government won’t let them leave..."
5588,Yup.
5589,You think the US govt waited 18 months to investigate this?
5590,They already know.
5591,This announcement is pure posturing.
5592,"AZ does, its distribution rights for china is held by Kantai Bio"
5593,How safe am I with only one dose?
5594,I took AZ.
5595,My family are scared to go out to buy groceries and I’m the only one in the fam with a jab.

5610,Won’t have enough Pfizer to get the younger people covered until October-ish.
5611,"The original plan was AZ for younger folk, but the blot clot drama meant ordering significantly more Pfizer than planned."
5612,Not really government’s fault though they’re getting a lot of blame.
5613,Before trials were even completed we’d ordered enough vaccines to vaccinate the population 3 times over.
5614,"Just mostly AZ (blot clot issues), University of Queensland one (cancelled because side effect was that you’d test positive for HIV for a few months) and Novavax (not out yet)."
5615,We’d only ordered a few (5?)
5616,million Pfizer.
5617,"Oh plenty of people are blaming the federal government, who are responsible for managing vaccine supply."
5618,There's a reckoning coming at some point.
5619,They had some bad luck as well though to exacerbate their incompetence.
5620,We had 5 or so vaccine options in the pipeline.
5621,Our locally developed vaccine was very effective but had a key flaw that made them stop development.
5622,Then the EU fucked us over on AZ.
5623,"Then AZ, our main fall back, had the clotting issues so they restricted it to 50+ with very little alternative supply for younger people."
5624,Then supply issues for all vaccines worldwide.
5625,Then our local AZ manufacturing had a few minor delays but it added to the snowball.
5626,Just a mess really.
5627,Endemic where?
5628,Do you know what the word endemic means?
5629,How are the small businesses doing there when there is lockdown?
5630,How much emergency funds do majority of people have?
5631,My country government cannot afford a lockdown because it affects the poor citizens that depends on daily wages.
5632,It’s weird.
5633,I felt happy for them and a longing to be there.
5634,And of course for things to clear up here.
5635,I never wanted them to be like us though.
5636,I’m really grateful that Australia has had the response it had and that it’s not spreading out of control across the country.
5637,I’m so happy that the citizens and residents see that it is worth the inconvenience and that they stick to the rules.
5638,Good on you!
5639,Just come down south and get it.
5640,It's available to everyone including mainlanders.

5648,I can say for sure that this little surge in cases has increased the demand for the vaccine here in Victoria.
5649,"I don’t think the slow vaccination program is entirely due to low demand, but to the extent that it contributes I do think this lockdown will actually help a bit."
5650,[removed]
5651,"For me personally it's a hard choice, I've suffered with health anxiety, to the point its made my life miserable and one of my main fears are clots, so I know a lot of people under 30 here aren't bothered about the risk from AZ and would still take it over other jabs if offered and you're right it is a small small risk but in my head that risk is terrifying."
5652,"I have been trying to talk myself into going back for it as I feel I'll be letting my community down by not being fully vaccinated, which jab did you get if you don't mind me asking?"
5653,"Its a catch-22 situation most Asian countries are facing(Taiwan, Singapore, Thailand, Australia):

\-Aim for zero covid and keep life close to normal with 1-2 lockdowns over the past 15 months has caused them to become very vaccine hesitant (why should I take."
5654,a vaccine if anyway cases arent entering the country).
5655,"Given the slow pace of rollout in this region ironically and somewhat perversely the US/Canada/EU will be a year ahead in true ""normalcy"" (normalcy in a endemic state accepting few cases and deaths per year via mass vaccination)."
5656,Im interested to see if these countries will ever open up before 2023 or 2024.
5657,I suspect not as maintaining a bubble of normalcy and blocking the borders may be popular from a political sense.
5658,At least as far as Australia /NZ are concerned I dont expect open borders before 2023.
5659,I suspect the public popularity of these measures maybe too hard to resist for the ruling governments.
5660,Partly explained by Astrazeneca dominating Australia's vaccination program with 12 weeks between doses and nobody is yet up to their second dose (AZ vaccinations commenced March 8).
5661,By total doses rather than fully vaccinated the picture is nowhere near as embarrassing and will rapidly improve as second AZ doses begin to be administered.
5662,I think the context was the decision to make once the virus was actually in the unvaccinated community.
5663,"Some government don’t have the balls to lock down an entire city, and it ends up with thousands dead from covid."
5664,"Meanwhile, in Hawaii this week you can hardly tell there's a global pandemic going on, other than most people wearing masks."
5665,"Beaches are packed, and stores and restaurants are busy."
5666,... says someone posting on Reddit
5667,"There's been a lot of mistakes too, including 17 hotel outbreaks, many of which could have been avoided by obvious measures like masks, routine testing, and keeping doors closed."
5668,"Despite these, the intention has been right and states have done well by unofficially following an elimination strategy."
5669,"Vax has been bad for many reasons, but suddenly looking brighter because (a) the latest outbreak and lockdown has been a national wake-up call to citizens and authorities alike (b) sudden availability of millions of Pfizer, the recommended vax for people under 50."
5670,People would take the shot if there were any shots to take.
5671,Which vaccine are they using that it’s only 60% effective?
5672,I don’t think I’ve ever read about one that was less than 70% effective after first shot.
5673,If the coalition wins the next election they will start talking about opening the borders and there will be a rush for vaccines.
5674,"Personally I hope this outbreak serves as a lesson, people get vaccinated faster, and the coalition gets voted out for their slowarse vaccine rollout."
5675,Hey sorry.
5676,Here we mostly call it BioNTech but I think I’ve mostly heard it referred to as Pfizer in English-speaking news so I decided to refer to it as such here.
5677,"But yes, it is officially BioNtech/Pfizer."
5678,Seems like a success of federalism to me!
5679,Checks and balances working as intended.
5680,China's incompetence is responsible for bringing this virus to the world.
5681,It's hard to trust them be part of the solution.
5682,Boy we all look like idiots because Trump actually turns out to be right about something?
5683,That’s not the point.
5684,"Your complaint wasn’t about the news being speculative, it was about AAPI hate crimes as a result of negative sentiment towards China."
5685,It is news that Biden has directed multiple intelligence agencies to investigate it.
5686,"Not having the complete story start to finish is not a reason to not publish, and potential hate crimes are also not a reason to not publish."
5687,The $50 isn't retroactive?
5688,That recall is starting to look pretty good.

5695,Australia is producing their own vaccines...
5696,"Yeah, I really agree that it is a personal choice, and I'm glad you made the one you are most comfortable with."
5697,"I made a different decision about my second shot (F/28), but that does not in any way invalidate the choice you made."
5698,"With the pill comparison, I am really just thinking (not even that passionately) whether the comparison might still hold."
5699,"But I think a lot of people insert a meta-text that if you think the comparison between AZ and the pill might hold, you must also believe that people should get AZ."
5700,I think it's more complex than that.
5701,Imaging being scared of a mask.
5702,I’d just like to interject for a moment.
5703,"What you’re refering to as Pfizer vaccine, is in fact, the BioNTech-Pfizer vaccine, or as I’ve recently taken to calling it, BioNTech plus Pfizer vaccine."
5704,"Pfizer did not develop the vaccine by itself, but rather another company called BioNTech created the original formula, which went through Pfizer's clinical trials and became the vaccine we use these days."
5705,"Many people who got the vaccine refer to it as the Pfizer vaccine, without realizing it."
5706,"Through a peculiar turn of events, the BioNTech-Pfizer vaccine which is widely used today is often called ""Pfizer"", and many of its users are not aware that it is basically the vaccine initially developed by BioNTech."
5707,"There really is a Pfizer contribute to the vaccine, and these people should partly thank that corporation, but it is just a part of what allowed them to be vaccinated."
5708,Pfizer is the distributor and responsible for clinical trials.
5709,"Clinical trials are an essential part of a vaccine, but useless by itself; they can only be done once somebody developed the vaccine in the first place."
5710,"So, the Pfizer vaccine can only be used because it was developed in the first place by BioNTech: the whole system is basically BioNTech with Pfizer contributions, or BioNTech/Pfizer."
5711,The so-called Pfizer vaccine should really be called BioNTech/Pfizer!
5712,"Vaccinations are necessary so we don’t need the public health measures, see?"
5713,"Inland cities, like Canberra, are significantly colder than Melbourne."
5714,Although Melbourne is the coldest large city with a population in the millions.
5715,"ok, then it's as i originally thought."
5716,that makes it even more simple.
5717,i was confused why you said i lumped pfizer with biontech.
5718,"Anyway, everyone goes through pfizer."
5719,period.
5720,"thus, the perversion is fosun's exclusive right to distribute in taiwan."
5721,"ffs, talk about off topic."
5722,the point is what other vaccine has this kind of separate exclusive distribution right?
5723,"Moderna, AZ, Johnson &amp; Johnson, sputnik, sinovac... is there another vaccine where they signed exclusive distribution rights to a particular region?"
5724,"Almost 100,000 all up, which is probably under-reported."
5725,Plus the human cost of those suffering from long term side effects.
5726,I don’t think it is endemic in Australia.
5727,It definitely is in the US.
5728,There are only 39 cases here.
5729,A short lockdown should put this in its place and then we’ll be back to actual normality / no cases again in a week or two.
5730,The fact that the incredible loss of life that is being experienced elsewhere is accepted as the norm is what’s really worrying.
5731,2020 vibes.
5732,What's the end-game here?
5733,You're gonna have 39+ cases when everyone is vaccinated too.
5734,"&gt; if something was uncovered very recently that’s prompting us to dig deeper

Yeah - there was a tech innovation."
5735,They can model the spread of covid in Wuhan using supercomputers now and are going to do that shortly.
5736,They're just lining up the ducks to make it clear this is a CCP fuck up.
5737,I'm about 90% confident its going to originate in a lab.
5738,Sounds similar to india - federal government is responsible for vaccine procurement n they're being incompetent
5739,[deleted]
5740,The tens of thousands who died in those states and their loved ones might disagree.
5741,Life has been pretty much back to normal here until we found out there was a new cluster on Monday.
5742,Won't be long until it's back again.
5743,"No, Africa needs to *distribute* 20 m jabs in six weeks."
5744,"The world has a history of dumping food, money, aid, medicine... on Africa only to have it go to waste, never get distributed, or get stolen."
5745,Memorable moment for anyone who watched the Australian Open.
5746,They had to evict the crowd during an evening match because the five day lockdown was about to begin (they become effective at midnight).
5747,And yet everyone lived their lives normally.
5748,And they will go right back to doing just that
5749,40 people have died in Florida for every one in Australia.
5750,And 90% of Australian deaths were in one hard hit state.
5751,"Life has also been ""normal"" for months here before this (minus the hundreds of thousands of covid deaths like US)."
5752,Florida is not a great model to compare in terms of success in controlling covid deaths.
5753,"For info I'm early 30s and got my first AZ jab back in February, I was in with the first mass group of young people, in the nhs/carers category, I havnt gone back for my 2nd due to the clotting issue, so it's all personal choice I suppose, I also don't use birth control so I don't ""pick"" one risk of clots over the other."

5755,They haven’t had their first peak yet.
5756,Are they vaccinating?
5757,But what's being reported right now aren't actual facts or anything official.
5758,"If you read the article, it's just speculation and gossip."
5759,90% of the article is officials refusing to comment on the matter because it's confidential and not yet public.
5760,"""There's unexamined evidence."""
5761,No shiz sherlock it's an ongoing investigation.
5762,In other news the sky is blue behind the clouds.
5763,It's raining where I live but there's no greater mystery as to what color the sky is.
5764,Wtf.
5765,I could see that being the case in normal times but to do that now is... unconscionable.
5766,Source?
5767,"Yeah our state govs have a lot of emergency powers, more than e.g."
5768,most countries in Europe.
5769,"The feds mostly demanded they open up state borders, schools reopen etc but the states basically ignored them for a year and saved our asses from most of the pandemic."
5770,Its a weird dynamic.
5771,Are you dumb or just ignorant ?
5772,"If 30 people have it and they each give it to 2 people because there is no lockdown (as you’d have it), then that’s 60 new cases."
5773,If those 60 give it to 2 people that’s 120.
5774,On and on.
5775,Also if 30 people have confirmed cases then there are undoubtedly a large number of people who are asymptomatic/undiagnosed unknowingly spreading it as well.
5776,This is why lockdowns happen.
5777,"&gt;The at risk groups are largely vaccinated already

We haven't even vaccinated half of 70+ year olds yet and we've vaccinated hardly any disability care residents at all."
5778,One is a public health measure and one is unnecessary government overreach
5779,"That's people that have received at-least one dose, it's only 60% effective after the first dose so I wouldn't classify them as 6% vaccinated."
5780,You haven’t solved the problem of your infectious ass spreading it
5781,Brazil is at 25%
5782,"The fact that Australia still need the horrible lockdown is not brave and life-saving, just incompetence from their government."
5783,"Vaccine, vaccine and vaccine."
5784,She’s a beaut Clark!
5785,But the point is the sinus brain clots(actual name escapes me) from the vaccine are rare in everyday life.
5786,"Clotting in legs, the kind associated with birth control are common in people everyday, plus a much higher survival rate, so if you would never have experienced the brain clot in everyday life because it's that rare do the benefits of the vaccine stop outweighing the risks for mainly younger people in areas where the virus isn't as prevalent?"
5787,"That's the issue in the UK we are having, that is why under 40s don't get offered AZ anymore."
5788,I see people and who took that picture.
5789,Get inside.
5790,Shouldn’t the Corona Police be rounding you up.
5791,I heard scomo was praying some
5792,So which country deals directly with Biontech?
5793,I've seen a lot of  weird vote shit going on lately and my theory is that its just reddit getting more popular and the brainless masses are showing up.
5794,Kinda like an eternal September situation.
5795,"And it makes sense, reddit has been in the news a bunch over the past few years and its really come to a head in 2020 with lockdown and the whole gme fiasco."
5796,So a bunch of fukin narcs showed up to narc the whole fucking thing up.
5797,"They're not winning yet, but I keep seeing signs of more facebookishness creeping in."
5798,[removed]

5800,not sure if you are intentionally missing the point or i am misunderstanding the situation.
5801,"as far as i can tell, countries around the world are free to obtain the vaccine from either pfizer or biontech."
5802,No country is forced to deal with only pfizer or only biontech.
5803,yes or no?
5804,let me know if i got this wrong.
5805,"&amp;nbsp;  
thus, the arrangement of rights for distribution by Fosun is unique to China."
5806,the problem is that it encompasses Taiwan.
5807,"For anyone asking why we are in this mess - our idiotic government bet on the wrong vaccine (Astra Zeneca), compounded an abysmal rollout by increasing vaccine hesitancy through inconsistent messaging and people were just complacent, counting in hotel quarantine continuing to keep the virus out."
5808,"(It didn’t)

Last week in the state of Victoria, about 6000 people were vaccinated and the mass vax centres were empty."
5809,"It took a frigging outbreak caused by a single happless returned traveller (who actually got infected with COVID From another quarantine hotel resident), to put 5 million of us back in this situation in a matter of 72 hours."
5810,"On a positivé note - Victoria recorded a phenomenal 17,000 people vaccinated in the last 24 hours as the proverbial penny dropped."
5811,"And yes, this is absolutely no way to live for another 12 months - near normality in fortress Australia with stage 4 lockdowns at the drop of a hat :/"
5812,"Not really, vaccine rollout is picking up pace nicely."
5813,The at risk groups are largely vaccinated already and we have almost no cases.
5814,You can't deny that Texas and Florida who basically eschewed all COVID controls months ago are doing fine though.
5815,"I know, the mechanisms are entirely different, but when it comes to outcomes (brain damage or death, i.e success of treatment) those are not so dissimilar to CVST caused by birth control."
5816,"I thought the outcomes are what matter to the person thinking of taking it, not the underlying mechanism, no?"
5817,[removed]
5818,... why?
5819,NSW only had one wide spread lockdown from March til June-ish 2020.
5820,The only other one was just the Northern Beaches for two-three weeks over Christmas (that was partially because you can completely cut those suburbs off from the rest of the country by closing three roads).
5821,NSW has handled the other outbreaks using contact tracing without a lockdown.
5822,Lol America is anything but normal.
5823,Feds need to pull their fingers out of their arse with vaccinations and returning Australians tho.
5824,Relatively decent vaccine program?
5825,We’re behind Kazakhstan...

5836,"Oh that makes a lot of sense, helps someone that has no knowledge of Aussie politics."
5837,Thanks.
5838,"Yeah, it's a logistical nightmare, and that in itself might be the ultimate reason to call a cancel or delay."
5839,"But.. there *is* a path where it could take place, it's just a very difficult one to carry out."
5840,"Competitors get vaccinated in their home countries, so no additional burden on Japan for that."
5841,But doctors and nurses..  maybe there's a way to cover that gap..
5842,I'm really not sure..
5843,My rabbit is 5 years old...  What does that have anything to do with the lab leak theory?
5844,I’m not sure what’s Belgium’s stance on the question.
5845,"They are vaccinating the 45+ as far as I’m aware, and they did mention something the younger population’s vaccine eligibility but tbh until know they only work on an individual invitation to get vaccinated, and that invitations are send by age, oldest first, so basically even if they open to all today, I’ll still have to wait until my age comes up and I’m invited."
5846,"😁

Easy fix."
5847,"If you are expecting the media to convey science properly, I fear you are doomed to be let down."
5848,Media are rational actors insofar as they will push the bounds of wording as far as is acceptable to ensure they get clicks and reposts on social media and therefore get more readers.

5856,So if my immune system is strong enough to beat this virus once you don’t think it can do it again?
5857,"""The US population is about 1.5 times greater than that of Brazil, but the US has reported 139 deaths in children younger than four years of age since the pandemic began""

In that context, 800 children dead is extremely alarming."
5858,"Now that schools are opening and mask mandates are lifting, i'd sure as hell want to understand the disparity if I had a kid going back to school."
5859,"Heck, with most adults vaccinated, kids could become the breeding ground for a new variant even if they aren't dying outright."
5860,There's a lot of good reasons to study Brazil's outbreak right now.
5861,95 percent protection is a relative rate.
5862,If there are 100 hospitalizations in a unvaccinated group then there are 5 in a matched vaccinated group.

5878,My soapbox?
5879,"You’re the one complaining about lockdown — something *the entire world* has had to deal with, not just you and Ontario personally."
5880,I got my vaccine from Kroger as soon as I was eligible to do so.
5881,I'm hoping I'll still be able to enter.
5882,Another great way to target homeless populations in the UK.
5883,Sometimes it’s hard for these people to stay in one location or have access to direct communication lines.
5884,The current political climate in Hong Kong is not ideal for vaccine roll out.
5885,There is a group of people who absolutely refuse to listen to the government.
5886,"Very much 'you die, I die' attitude."
5887,Sinovac is absolutely out of the question with this group.
5888,"Hong Kong government is highly unlikable by its general population, no surprises there."
5889,The only thing it has quantitatively has done well is control the spread of covid through strong border lockdown.
5890,So significant chunk of the population is very much 'why take vaccine risk when covid is well controlled?
5891,I'll take the vaccine when I can go on holiday'.
5892,But people can't go on holiday until almost everyone gets vaccinated.
5893,Local media is also incredibly irresponsible.
5894,They have been reporting every bad medical event post vaccination with no professional ever saying it has links with vaccination.
5895,So people get the impression that vaccine = death.
5896,I've finally convinced my parents in Hong Kong to get their vaccination after bugging them for 2 months.
5897,"From what they heard from people, their family and friends in Hong Kong seems to be getting loads of side effects from vaccination, to the extent my aunt had to be hospitalised and some with shakey hands (applies to both Sinovac and BioNTech)."
5898,So they were super concerned about side effects.
5899,"On the other hand, all their family and friends in the UK (including me) all only had typical flu-like symptoms."
5900,Which is what convinced them to get it.
5901,Haha!
5902,Well they are not exactly modern
5903,I meant 39
5904,"That's ""can have vaccine"" in theory."
5905,"Biontech is approved for 12+ now, but we don't have enough doses to vaccinate most 12+ year olds until July or August, I guess."
5906,"Also, the German standing commission on vaccination (Stiko) is not convinced that the vaccine is actually a great idea for kids since they usually have very mild Covid and parents, grandparents etc."
5907,can get a vaccine.
5908,They want to wait for more data on vaccine safety for the 12+ age group before they recommend for or against the vaccine for kids.
5909,This is completely why pretty much all over Australia has been living normal life for the past year with only 900 deaths.
5910,The Sweden experiment was being so highly praised a year ago and now they have more deaths and lower GDP than neighbouring countries because they didn’t lockdown.
5911,"If working from home for a week while still being able to exercise and walk pets, go shopping is oppressed than wow."
5912,People are pissed at the federal government for bad vaccine rollouts but the state governments doing these lockdowns is the only thing from having a situation like US has had for the past year.
5913,I’m sure there are antivax epidemiologists out there also peddling lies or insanity.
5914,"Boom, immediate fame."
5915,No of course not.
5916,That would be a serious international scandal.
5917,But efforts should continue to protect Asian Americans from racist attacks.
5918,I'm not sure.
5919,"I think they take it as some type of statement they need to fight against.They think it's all been a fake, media driven ""cold"" to defeat the x president."

5928,&gt;My theory is that it is a combination of it leaking from a lab accidentally and picking up something at the wet mart.
5929,What an absurd comment...It cannot be BOTH.
5930,What a nightmare.
5931,Global vaccination absolutely is an arms race against the virus.
5932,&gt; There will be fallout if a lab or country is to blame.
5933,"So if it turns out it was leaked from a lab, and China did cover it up, should that news story be cencorsed to protect Asians from attack?"
5934,The number of daily shots in the US has somewhat plateaued over the past two weeks.
5935,Some of this is probably due to 12-16 year olds being eligible but still better than what it would be without this announcement.
5936,To anyone who claims this is infringing on your rights: this is literally the free market at work.
5937,Ontario has been on lockdown since November 2019?
5938,Before covid was on anyone’s radar in North America?
5939,How did Ontario have such foresight and vision??!
5940,Also- it’s clearly not a real lockdown since everyone is still partying and gathering.
5941,Janssen Pharmaceutica is the vaccine branch of J&amp;J.
5942,"No, it isn't a ""that's it!"""
5943,But best evidence indicates it is a substantial factor.
5944,"Nobody is saying not to look at all factors, but you're angry that people are pointing to a factor having to do with stupid decisions made by people who could've helped contain the spread and chose not to."
5945,There is no reason to believe seasonality is a significant cause of the United States having a covid problem orders of magnitude than Australia when it's been a bit over a year of this pandemic and all the seasons have happened everywhere.
5946,There certainly are plenty of other factors having to do with population density and climate.
5947,"But the United States is an outlier in our high rates of infection and death, especially among wealthy nations."
5948,Your real problem is that you are offended that anyone dare suggest that some Americans deciding not to wear a mask caused needless death and suffering.
5949,You don't want to hear it.
5950,And that has you looking at every conceivable cause except anything that has to do with human agency.
5951,The problem isn't people saying we should ignore any other factors.
5952,That's not what is happening.
5953,The problem is you wanting to ignore and discredit one of the most obvious and well substantiated factors out there because paying it any attention makes you feel like maybe the stupid and selfish actions of people who refused to distance and wear masks actually had horrifying consequences.
5954,The mental gymnastics you're performing to protect yourself from that thought are unimpressive.

6036,"I live in Kiruna, Sweden (probably the worst covid municipality in the EU right now) with over 20 cases on my school (800 students) last two weeks and the 12-16 years old started home school just today."
6037,"The municipalitys school leading did nothing so the ""krisledningsnämnden"" (crisis control group) had to take over the control of the schools to close them."
6038,That information was public in January....Is it possible that both the left and the right have been playing politics with science?
6039,Spoiler alert........YES
6040,We lost ctrl and now there's no esc!
6041,"I don't live in Cali, so I'm not complaining about losing out on $50, since I'm not eligible anyway."
6042,"What I have issue with is that:

It might cause people in other states to hesitate longer and wait until there's a reward for getting vaccinated."
6043,"And if other states don't have these programs soon, these vaccine hesitant people might hesitate for a very long time and end up dragging out this pandemic longer than it needs to."
6044,It's essentially rewarding bad behavior.
6045,They are right though.
6046,Countries that are dealing with high covid cases have a more dire need for the vaccine.
6047,Or is it that you are just pissed that you can't go on vacation without the vaccine.
6048,Are they fuckin around?
6049,Exactly
6050,"I wish I could, but that's impossible."
6051,Everyone down here in the south is an antivaxxer.
6052,Almost all of them are like that.
6053,Especially in the fields of trade work.
6054,Forgetting that covid is airborne and surfaces are not the threat.
6055,"The fact that sealed the deal for me was this: if the false rumor that the vaccine causes sterility were true, then... Covid would also cause it."
6056,That’s not happening.
6057,Science should be debated like it has been in this case.
6058,"Some folks put this theory forward, it was debated and found lacking."
6059,However there are those who chose to take it like gospel and run with it.
6060,I think it’s extremely harmful and sinister.
6061,It pulls at your heartstrings because you wonder what if?
6062,Or people like me who have ptsd from grief are re-traumatized because we have to choose between a deadly disease or our worst fears.
6063,Broken clock etc.
6064,"If your brain doesn't have the capacity to do anything but throw shit at the wall, some of it still going to stick."

6066,It might cause people in other states to hesitate longer and wait until there's a reward for getting vaccinated.
6067,"And if other states don't have these programs soon, these vaccine hesitant people might hesitate for a very long time and end up dragging out this pandemic longer than it needs to."
6068,It's essentially rewarding bad behavior.
6069,It’s endemic on planet Earth.
6070,"As long as Australia allows travel, the virus will continue to be reintroduced."
6071,I’m not sure how many years Australia will continue a futile effort to keep the virus out even after everyone who wants a vaccine there gets inoculated.
6072,"Well, Australia is due to its policies in a very good situation in regards to Covid compared to other nations."
6073,So it is actually very nice of Australia to not cut the line and have poorer countries who are devastated by the virus to get the vaccines before them.
6074,Australia can afford to wait.
6075,Other nations cannot.
6076,Melbourne has had it rougher than the rest of the country.
6077,"Here in Sydney, beyond the occasional few days of mandatory masks here and there, life has been back to normal for a good while."
6078,Like since Oct-nov last year.
6079,No.
6080,Honest question.
6081,If they are free to the patient then entry into the sweepstakes has nothing to do with any purchase.
6082,Not seeing a problem with incentivizing the process and hopefully this encourages more people to get vaccinated.
6083,‘Merica!
6084,I've been in the room for bone marrow biopsies and anytime the doc starts up the drill my butthole puckers a little bit.
6085,Alberta is fully reopening in a month
6086,Limbo world champions.
6087,Vaccine rollout is atrocious.
6088,Government put all its money and effort into AstraZeneca but now anyone under 50 gets Pfizer and over 50s get AstraZeneca.
6089,Government wants everyone offered first jab by end of 2021 but about 1/3 Australians are vaccine hesitant.
6090,"Power to the people, workers of the world unite..."
6091,"Seriously, I heard a right leaning coworker yapping in the break room the other day about how if people are so worried about covid they need to keep sanitizing their hands and move on with their lives and just forget this whole mask thing."
6092,Next time give your business to someone you should make it conditional on them being vaccinated.
6093,Not really.
6094,It’s been kept under control pretty well.
6095,Just a few days ago it was at zero for community transmissions and had been that way for months.
6096,This is the title of the article…

6100,Yes.
6101,"&gt;The South Asia region - India, Bangladesh, Pakistan, Bhutan, Nepal, Maldives and Sri Lanka - accounts for 18% of global cases and almost 10% of deaths."

6109,I hope so.
6110,They still have time to tighten their protocols and vaccinate people if they act with urgency.
6111,I'm not saying they were.
6112,I'm saying that the pandemic is not as bad as the media have made out and agree with you about the demographics that have died.
6113,Is this news?
6114,The entire country is going to be 100% back to normal by Labor Day.
6115,Most of it already is as of now.
6116,"Sure, but it's not nothing."
6117,This is still huge at preventing severe illness and death as compared to a population with zero immunity.
6118,Do I have to quarantine in Canada before returning to my residence in America?
6119,I'm in Iceland for work and plan on returning to the states in a few days.
6120,I'm a Canadian citizen with a valid I-94.
6121,The company I'm working with is concerned that I will need to go quarantine in Canada for 14 days before returning to my home in the US.
6122,This seems pretty silly to me if true.
6123,"Why would they fly me back to America, then to Canada, and back to America again?"
6124,Does anyone have experience with this?
6125,I hope I win
6126,Not all vaccinations are 100% perfect.
6127,We need the most amount of people possible to be vaccinated to be protected.
6128,"So yes, if me and my kids have the vaccination we still want others to be vaccinated."
6129,It is everyone's responsibility so we don't let that fucking disease come back.
6130,You don't have to be American to understand facts.
6131,There is plenty information online on the subject.
6132,The American Healthcare system is good but not exactly accessable to those who don't have the money.
6133,Yes.
6134,I'm in priority group 3 and I've been waiting for my first dose for months.
6135,I wonder who this 40% of the population who have been vaccinated are?
6136,Is it the big companies who have been getting their own supplies for employees from the government or sharp-elbowed low priority people who have been phoning all the doctors?
6137,"As a non-german living in Germany, I'm deeply unimpressed by the German rollout."
6138,"&gt;probably

Lol fuckin source dude?"
6139,The majority that died were old as fuck or had other complications just like the rest of the world.
6140,People weren't dying of covid on the street outside the hospital because they couldn't get in.
6141,You have absolutely no idea how things work here.
6142,Good point!
6143,[deleted]
6144,"He's likely referring to Florida Man Ronnie DeSantis's [unique statute](https://flsenate.gov/Session/Bill/2021/2006/BillText/er/PDF) prohibiting businesses, schools, and the like from requiring vaccination from people who enter their private property."
6145,"That law has yet to be tested constitutionally, but even if it withstands constitutional muster, no one is being *denied entry* here; there's simply a discount available for people who opt to get the vaccine."
6146,&gt;Really appreciate all the downvotes too; sorry I’m ignorant and just trying learn.
6147,I hate how unfriendly reddit is to people who genuinely don't know better.

6165,You just need to get it.
6166,"Actually, I don't know if you can say that yet."
6167,The actual details of the sweepstakes haven't been ironed out as far as I can tell.
6168,What?
6169,No one is going to do that because what a fucking terrible show to pay that much money for.

6179,What else?
6180,At my book store books are $10 but $5 if you show me your report card and have 3 A's on it.

6187,This subsection does not otherwise restrict businesses from instituting screening protocols consistent with authoritative or controlling government-issued guidance to protect public health.
6188,People without vaccines are not being *denied entry*.
6189,They may purchase tickets at the full price of $999.99.
6190,"However, vaccinated people are being given a discount on the retail price."
6191,"It's also probably worth pointing out that Florida's law has yet to be tested, constitutionally."
6192,I think the Constitutional doctrine of free association would likely give private entities the right to choose not to associate with people who are a public health hazard.
6193,Lol.
6194,"Ok. You’re right, I didn’t specify that the choice involved wasn’t otherwise protected by the US constitution."

""I totally understand, that's actually pretty reasonable to feel that way."
6203,So I can count on you to get vaccinated next week when the FDA fully approves the vaccine?
6204,"I heard that they might be ready with the full testing by then."""
6205,Putting it off because of your own health issues is a completely valid reason to do so!
6206,I'm super pro-vax but I feel like a lot of others can overlook legitimate reasons why some might wait or end up not getting it and relying on the herd around them.

6230,"I am aware of those studies, but if I may say you might be overlooking two nuances:
- There is a difference between which variant you are talking about."
6231,There is ton of research to say that garden variety variants provide long lasting immunity but not some other ones.
6232,I havent seen a single research saying that variants like SA or with similar mutation dont need vaccination after past infection.
6233,"If you know of one, would love to see it."
6234,- Its not about whether you have breakthroughs (eg that sports team you cited) but how likely it is.
6235,If after vaccination you have a 5% chance of breakthrough but without it you have 20% chance that is two quite different things.
6236,Also I am not saying that your therapist is at extreme risk or that they should be glued to the internet looking at data.
6237,They can do whatever they want.
6238,Just pointing out the science

6245,Lol.
6246,I’m so glad I live where I live.
6247,Been freemasking it for weeks now.
6248,Wearing a mask when you’re vaccinated suggests a basic misunderstanding of the science IMO.
6249,"Yes, it’s quite unfortunate."
6250,"Yes, you can get tested for antibodies, which you will only have if you've been exposed to it through infection or vaccine."
6251,I hope this is true!
6252,I know it's the case on my local subs too.
6253,So telling a trans person they can’t use a bathroom isn’t discrimination since it was their choice to change their sex?

6288,"That would be fine, but the OP and your comment specifically site flu cases - not infections - and then go on to say you are using IFR."
6289,You are only calculating an IFR if you have an Infection count.
6290,"The CDC flu numbers do not attempt to count Infections - they estimate Symptomatic Cases, while some studies estimate asymptomatic flu rates at 75% or more."
6291,"We also don't know the COVID Infection rate, so I'm back to wondering why we're trying to guess at Infection numbers when we have Case numbers in front of us?"
6292,"If we wanted to ballpark the ""current CFR"" for COVID, we could take Cases from 3 weeks ago and Deaths from now (21 days is a common diagnosis to death window)."
6293,7-day average Deaths on May 27 was 536.
6294,"7-day average Cases on May 6 was 46,366."
6295,"That still gives a ""estimated current COVID CFR"" of 1.15% compared to the CDC referenced by the OP high end flu numbers of 62k deaths in 56M cases for a CFR (not IFR) of 0.11%."
6296,"With these numbers of COVID still being 10x deadlier than recent flu, 25k cases a day is going to result in almost twice the number of deaths as the annual flu burden."

6340,*
6341,You mean telling people to act unvaccinated after getting a jab was ineffective messaging?
6342,Who knew
6343,It’s not myopic.
6344,If Japan is so decentralized how did they ever sign a contract with the IOC on behalf of one country?
6345,The national government has done almost nothing to insure that Japan will be safe from infection other than banning foreign fans.
6346,Whats not settled?
6347,There are tons of studies saying certain variants can bypass past infection acquired immunity (e.g https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2021/03/210323131203.htm).
6348,And there is real world data from J&amp;J trials in South Africa that showed night and day difference in immunity from past infection vs vaccination.
6349,"Also, you dont need to be well-read on these studies."
6350,"Guidance from CDC, health professionals on TV, etc, has consistently been that you need vaccine even with past infection."
6351,Your therapist cant make up a belief and have it pass for common knowledge.

6357,Unvaccinated doesn't mean you have the virus.
6358,"You can't spread being unvaccinated, which is the medical procedure circumcision was being compared to."
6359,It’s a good thing we put so many security features in those vaccine cards.
6360,Pace of vaccinations are ramping up quite a bit after a slow start in the first months of this year.
6361,"Currently everyone born in 1975 and older are eligible to make an appointment, while this was 1968 and older roughly a week ago."

6370,You’re misunderstanding the point.
6371,"The point of the post wasn’t to suggest that kids should be forced to get vaccinated, it was that kids should wait their turn behind older people who are more at risk."
6372,"When the full FDA approval comes, they'll find another excuse."
6373,"""OH YEAHH WELL HOW COULD THEY APPROVE SO FAST?!?!?!?!"
6374,"VACCINES REQUIRE MINIMUM 14 YEARS FOR APPROVAL!"""
6375,[deleted]
6376,"As someone living in a country 4 months behind on rolling out vaccines compared to the US: Wait, you don't have a digital certificate to verify you got the shot?"
6377,!
6378,We tend to always talk and think in absolutes but people are all over the place in assessing and rationalizing cost vs. risk.
6379,"Lost my smell and taste and now all I can smell is a constant lingering ammonia like chemical smell for the last 2 days, it's all I can think about and it's driving me insane, has anyone else had this weird chemical smell aswell?"
6380,"Oh yeah, we’re gonna see that Mozambique Independence Day surge sometime in July too."
6381,Truly dreadful.
6382,"If a 20 dollar bill is fake someone lost 20 dollars, if a vaccine card is fake, immunocompromised people who cant get vaccines could die from covid."
6383,"i get your point here, but i still think we should take this as if not more seriously than money"
6384,Full lockdown?
6385,You’re spreading huge misinformation and you really should delete your post - there is talk of postponing the final relaxation of restrictions and that’s it.
6386,It was always expected to rise as more social contact took place and the government/scientific advisors mentioned as such.
6387,Or you just get stuck with tickets nobody wants
6388,That’s totally radical.
6389,I man the $20 bill has some pretty crazy security so maybe we shouldn't hold it to that high of a standard lol
6390,[removed]
6391,"Don’t listen to scambush he’s spouting absolute rubbish, no chance of going into full lockdown just a potential postponement of the final restrictions being removed on June 21st"
6392,How did you get to /r/Coronavirus without knowing about the existence of Covid-19?
6393,And you’re an asshole.
6394,"And hopefully they will be maskless, too."
6395,(There are some planned for August that are happening.
6396,"Currently they require masks, but that may change, too.)"
6397,"It’s the bare minimum because social distancing from unvaccinated people and avoiding crowded public places/public places where you have to be maskless is an extra step but at this point with more people vaccinated and cases going down, we can still get vaxxed and mask at Walmart but we also have the option to go to a restaurant or the gym and still be relatively safe if we’re vaccinated."
6398,Yet some unvaccinated people are still not masking and have no intentions to get vaccinated.
6399,It’s so simple yet they won’t do it.
6400,The bar is on the floor here.
6401,"Lol ""there is not gonna be a two class society"""
6402,That's not how rebels work.
6403,"When their leaders aren’t elected, they don’t really have the same pressures as a democratic government."
6404,Especially when you factor in information control.
6405,Overplaying their hand.
6406,Will soon find out how loyal their fans are(n't)
6407,"A lot of people miss that importent point 

There is zero, and I repeat *zero* evidence that this variant behaves any pathologically different way than any other variant or produces any physiologically different effects."
6408,It’s *highly* likely the increased mortality is the result of other factors.
6409,"The media keeps trying to force this variant to be more lethal among younger individuals, and there is precisely zero evidence to support this."
6410,But it’s still better than Coronavirus
6411,"Ok, only people of certain races and religions can buy tickets, people who are pro life, people who aren’t unhealthily overweight."
6412,"Free market, right?"
6413,Not if people are still masking by then we aren't.
6414,He even says it's possible for the elementary kids to have masks in the fall.
6415,"I can't call that ""back to normal."""
6416,[removed]
6417,That's the percentage by which positive tests are lowered.
6418,"How ""punk rock"" of them."
6419,"Masking and Vaccinating are not the ""bare minimum""."
6420,"You just named the only 2 things and called it ""bare minimum""."
6421,"Headline: ""Gov."
6422,"Murphy on NJ’s ‘very strong’ position to fully reopen schools by fall""

Actual article:

&gt; There are vaccines in trial for younger kids, but they're not yet approved."
6423,"So, my guess is, ***we're going to see some combination of public health parameters,*** at least at the beginning of the school year, to make sure we can open up safely and responsibly."
6424,Ugh... so that means we could be having to wear masks in school next year.
6425,Sooooooooo not ready for this.
6426,But that's probably what I deserve for letting my guard down.
6427,Finally something that makes sense.
6428,That certainly depends on if you are being forced into the line or not.
6429,"Well first of all, no one is obliged to answer or correct you here."
6430,Voting is enough of an opinion sometimes.
6431,"Second, this number is significantly higher than many other countries and should entail a closer investigation."
6432,"Child care is a complicated field, we don't know everything about how Corona virus, the behavior of the virus on kids is still being studied, and it's pretty obvious the whole country is being badly managed on the covid response, that's why the government and the president are under extreme pressure and being formally investigated on his response."
6433,"The proposed ""heard immunity"" is a bullshit argument, we are basically seeing the effects of letting the virus go wild and kill as many as it can, until it stops killing."
6434,It won't stop.
6435,This is a criminal strategy and the president should be impeached and jailed.
6436,People raged for a lot less but 450.000 deaths now are just business as usual.
6437,Almost half million deaths and there is no end in sight.
6438,Not really.
6439,"Vaccines do not all work by the same mechanism, and they induce different types of immunity."
6440,"The term ""immunity"" is not one-size-fits-all."
6441,"For what it's worth, you also need boosters for HepA/HepB, Hib (an influenza type no one knows about precisely because you're vaccinated against it as a child) and MMR."
6442,All viruses.
6443,"Case in point, nobody was saying the baker who refused to bake a wedding cake for a gay couple had the right to do that because it infringed on the rights of the couple who sought a service, but here, suddenly the rights of the individual doesn’t matter because “free market.” To be clear, I am not making an argument for anti-vaxxers nor do I even remotely think these groups of people are justified for believing the way that they do, but it’s funny to me how “rights of the business” come up in these cases and not in the case like the one mentioned earlier."
6444,"&gt; There are vaccines in trial for younger kids, but they're not yet approved."
6445,"So, my guess is, ***we're going to see some combination of public health parameters,*** at least at the beginning of the school year, to make sure we can open up safely and responsibly."
6446,i.e.
6447,masks and social distancing... ugh... and that's assuming NJEA will agree to this (they probably will keep virtual learning or something)
6448,Be nice.
6449,It has to be sarcasm…..
6450,I really hope nobody would genuinely believe that lol
6451,"I can't speak to whatever situation you're talking about, but the fact remains that vaccination rates are high in MA, even in high-risk demographics."
6452,Amazing.
6453,"I sure hope you are right, I don't think you are tho."
6454,Time will tell.
6455,They started last weekend.
6456,Folks were lining up for boom chicka pop kettle corn and mixed nuts.
6457,[removed]
6458,[removed]
6459,Or at the very least swap for future vaccines.
6460,"Now see, THIS is way better than the random ass lotteries!"
6461,Make em pay more if they don't wanna vaccinate.
6462,Don't just give money away
6463,Technically it is still discriminatory since different groups of people are being treated differently.
6464,I got my 2nd shot other day and im sick as fuck and feel like deaths door.
6465,DAMN STRAIGHT I want discount shit for this lol.
6466,You know that bakery took their case to the supreme court on an appeal and won right?
6467,"This is completely inaccurate, but thanks for at least spelling HIPAA correctly."
6468,So many people like you who say wrong things about the law spell it with two Ps.
6469,"Honestly, I am expecting the same surge to happen in the Netherlands (and eventually probably the rest of the EU and US as well), because we are letting restrictions go quite quickly."
6470,But it will not be the scary kind of surge.
6471,"Low deaths, low hospitalisations and a high/medium amount of cases due to vaccines."
6472,"For example, in the Netherlands we have already had a surge in terms of cases but low level of deaths due to vaccinations (~8000 cases/~20 deaths = ~0.25% CFR)."
6473,Unfortunately not enough were vaccinated yet to prevent lots of hospitalisations.
6474,Now there are enough vaccinated and you immediately see the huge drop in hospitalisations together with cases even though we have been letting go of restriction for ~2 month now.
6475,A new surge would likely look similar but without the added hospitalisations this time.
6476,And we will (eventually) welcome tourists from abroad with open arms.
6477,"I will probably go on vacation to another country this summer as well (no plans yet), just like last summer."
6478,Can't wait!
6479,"I mean, yeah?"
6480,"The department of health, your insurance, or your healthcare provider will have your information on file."
6481,It wouldn’t be particularly complex to send out updated cards.
6482,"It wouldn’t be cheap, sure... but considering covid isn’t going to disappear and boosters will be likely relevant in the future, it would be worth the costs."
6483,"Add in the fact that future pandemics are possible, and future vaccines may be relevant."
6484,"For 99% of people vaccinated, you wouldn’t have to have them come pick up a new card, you’d just mail it back."
6485,"The only difficulties would be those without a permanent address, but you could absolutely set up pick up options at a local clinic."
6486,"I’m not saying this needs to happen, but doing so wouldn’t be a huge issue and would help prevent people abusing the system (and putting people at risk.)"
6487,Of course not.
6488,I was masked myself.
6489,I just thought people were desperate to be done and was caught by surprise when that wasn’t the case
6490,You do know the supreme court upheld the business' side in that case right?
6491,"They said since the couple could get cake elsewhere, it was fine."
6492,This may be our worst vaccine and it would end the pandemic in 6 weeks if we could give everyone a dose today.
6493,Even weakly vaccinated people have very strong protective (though not sterilizing) immunity.
6494,[removed]
6495,Maybe not.
6496,"As we get older, possibly develop other conditions, our ability to fight infections can change, I would think."
6497,Probably check you vaccine card at the door.
6498,That what we did up in Seattle for the Vaccinated section at the Sounders Game.
6499,[removed]
6500,Are they verifying with vaccination cards?
6501,[removed]
6502,This is literally correct.
6503,"In some cases, especially involving public health, discrimination is okay."

6510,"Well the two famous singers who represented the country for Eurovision had it, but that may have been a week and a half ago."

6512,"Or, you cant even come in of you're Asian."
6513,Is that $18 before Ticketmaster enters the chat?
6514,Being unvaccinated isn't contagious either...
6515,&gt; How?
6516,In Hamburg they are still only vaccinating 70+year olds.
6517,"Bullshit, more than 40% of hamburg already got a dose."
6518,"I honestly know people who thought it meant it wasn't safe, that went and got it after I told them what it meant."
6519,Some people don't look very far into things at all.
6520,"They had open fights and lots of property damage from utterly drunk people during ""spring break""."
6521,Israel had dozens of deaths in the (religious) partying after they reopened.
6522,Curfews aren't just about the pandemic.

6527,[Here](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/cases-updates/burden.html) is the CDC’s page detailing their estimate of how many Americans actually got COVID between last February and this March.
6528,Add a couple million cases to that to include those who got it in the last two months or so.
6529,"So around 116 million total (give or take... well, several million or more)

About half of Americans have gotten at least one dose and half haven’t."
6530,"So again, very rough estimate, about 58 million Americans who had COVID but have no vaccine- that’s 17.5% of the population."
6531,"So when I see 50% of Americans have at least one dose of vaccine, I add 15-20 to that to estimate how many people have *some* immunity."
6532,TIL I need to buy a case of Corona instead of something drinkable
6533,It would be funny if Boris Johnson got the Johnson vaccine

6546,Yep.
6547,It gives me absolutely no hope for the next pandemic that is coming anytime soon.
6548,I think it’s beyond certainty now that we clearly failed this dress rehearsal for the next and likely far worse pandemic
6549,"Massachusetts has already achieved levels of vaccination that many  states in this country will probably never reach, and with it cases, deaths, hospitalizations have tanked."
6550,Without even getting into what the true herd immunity threshold may  be there is so much more to consider beyond just percentage of fully vaccinated such as those that have immunity from infection and the protection provided by a single vaccine dose.
6551,"I would love for this country to reach herd immunity before we consider the pandemic over but that is likely not going to happen on a large scale, so yes getting cases down to miniscule numbers with a vast majority of your population immune would probably classify as ""pretty much over"""
6552,Just don't get measles!
6553,!
6554,Colorado cases really spiked last month as B.1.1.7 took over completely RIGHT as we opened vaccinations to everyone.
6555,If we hadn't gotten vaccines things could have gotten really bad really quickly.
6556,But they are completely cratering now everywhere except Colorado Springs.
6557,[removed]
6558,Exactly.
6559,A free vaccine to get a discounted ticket is still the least expensive way to go.
6560,I meant in the sense that zero cases is never achievable and the strategy has to move away from that

&gt; If there’s one thing about COVID-19’s death toll that researchers seem to agree on, it’s that the official count is probably way too low."
6618,&gt; But the extent of the undercount is a source of contention.
6619,"&gt; That may help explain why, when the influential Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation in Seattle released a new model this month suggesting that the true number of COVID-19 deaths around the world was more than double the figure from the World Health Organization, response from other experts was mixed."
6620,"&gt; Some researchers who were interviewed for this story said the model seemed solid, but just as many criticized it, suggesting the team glossed over the uncertainties inherent in estimates like these and didn’t share sufficient detail about how their statistical sausage was made."

6631,&gt; Antibodies — proteins that can recognize and help to inactivate viral particles — are a key immune defence.
6632,"After a new infection, short-lived cells called plasmablasts are an early source of antibodies."
6633,"&gt; But these cells recede soon after a virus is cleared from the body, and other, longer-lasting cells make antibodies: memory B cells patrol the blood for reinfection, while bone marrow plasma cells (BMPCs) hide away within bones, trickling out antibodies for decades."

6675,"Although, no market is truly free as there is regulation"
6676,Apparently vaccine hesitancy/skepticism in Japan is very high.
6677,A lot of people are refusing to get the vaccine.
6678,The scientific community was not allowed to publicly talk about this.
6679,"YouTube, Twitter and Facebook all followed an official policy of labeling as misinformation, or outright censoring, any content that suggested the virus leaked from a lab."
6680,"The corporate media often included phrases like “referencing a conspiracy theory without any basis in evidence.”

There was a coordinated campaign to silence anyone who suggested this."
6681,That obviously had a chilling effect.
6682,I’m sure there were plenty of scientists who shared this opinion but simply chose not to voice it due to fear of ostracization.
6683,This is not a story about coronavirus.

6694,"I’m pretty sure “get in line” is usually used with the meaning “wait your turn, don’t jump the queue”."
6695,"As far as I know, it doesn’t denote violence or authoritarianism."
6696,"To be fair, you can transmit covid if vaccinated if you do catch it."
6697,Most of the reports only share the data for vaccines presenting the effectiveness against severe disease or sometimes symptomatic disease.
6698,They have studied the effectiveness on spread that suggests it not only reduces chance to get covid but also the ability to transmit it if you do have it.
6699,Can’t find it now but someone posted data from Israel a few weeks ago.
6700,"So you can transmit covid if you are vaccinated and have a breakthrough case, but it’s significantly reduced chance to both get covid and to transmit it if you do get it."
6701,It’s just a very complex topic so it’s hard to message this nuance.
6702,"The likely method of action is that even if you do get sick the viral load is kept lower because of some immune response and while it hasn’t been proven, there appears to be a strong link between viral load and transmissibility."
6703,[removed]
6704,"With the exception of people who are dying after very long battles with covid and people who are unable to receive the vaccine for medical reasons, we are getting to the point in which the vast majority of deaths could have been prevented."
6705,It's been well over a month since the vaccine was made widely available to pretty much everyone in the US.
6706,"If vaccination pace had kept up, everyone over 16 years old could at least be partially vaccinated right now."

6720,"I’d bet you’re fine, but maybe take it easy today just in case."
6721,"Too many people overlap both groups, and we had a terrible testing rate early on, making estimates of the number of infections really inaccurate."
6722,"We definitely know how many people are vaccinated, but we can only guess blindly at how many people have only natural immunity."
6723,It's not going to matter soon anyway.
6724,The math is 2 billion dollars for 50 million extra vaccinated (+15%).
6725,That is so cheap as compared to 3-4 trillion of pandemic stimulus.
6726,The problem is always trying to stop the people who abuse the policy.
6727,"You want people to stay home when they are sick but not think they have a free pass to go out on a Tuesday night, drink until 3am, then call in b/c they are hung over."
6728,I have known a disturbing number of people who would easily take 5+ “sick” days off a month if there weren’t any consequences.

6733,I definitely think he'd get it for 50 bucks.
6734,Evidently there is a price tag on spreading covid.

6746,"I mean, it would make sense because our first dose numbers have been lagging behind for a few days but our second dose numbers are doing great."
6747,Plus don't they want to close the Impfzentrum at the [end of July](https://www.mopo.de/hamburg/strategie-erklaert-so-impft-sich-hamburg-durch-den-sommer-38375118)?
6748,Is their plan to just have everyone cold call doctors for the rest of the summer or do you think they'll update the booking service to include vaccine appointments with GPs?

6755,There have also been several news stories about fake vaccination card distributors being charged with federal crimes.
6756,"The more those get publicized, the faster idiots will just go get the free vaccine rather than risk federal charges."
6757,I feel that $50 per shot would go a long ways towards establishing better population immunity.
6758,(And would also pay for itself)

6773,I’m willing to bet that a fair bit of the unvaccinated are motivated not by fear but by a lack of motivation.
6774,"The more unvaccinated people, the less effective my vaccination and everyone else's."
6775,"This isn't just COVID, but every other infectious disease."
6776,"So to a degree, yes."
6777,I do care that others aren't getting vaccinated.
6778,That article is a few months old.

6785,"Even if PLT count is low, clinical significance needs to be assessed."
6786,"Yeah all good - I just meant the comparison mainly for context from the Australian perspective, so figured I should clarify."
6787,"Granted, I do believe plenty of other countries could have adopted similar approaches to Australia - the economic impact has been far from being as severe as initial concerns suggested, for e.g."
6788,It just saddens me that there are so many deaths which could have been avoided across the globe.
6789,It was only taboo because of the xenophobic way it has been discussed by our elected officials.
6790,Most definitions of herd immunity include people that have antibodies from the vaccine and/or being previously infected.
6791,I can't find any sites reporting on that number.
6792,I imagine it might be hard to get the number.
6793,"However, I remember reading a study last summer that checked dialysis patients for antibodies."
6794,I can't find any follow ups to that study.
6795,I imagine that would be a pretty reliable way to get that measurement.

6997,To decide that one of the biggest challenges to the human race should be dealt with by Mark Zuckerberg's goon's and other tech sites is insane to put it lightly.
6998,It has been proven that social media has the power to put up and take down governments and to influence masses of people into specific behaviour; to shake the foundations of democracy.

7021,You appear to have locked yourself into a binary that I am not a part of.
7022,There are any number of ways to both prevent the spread of disease and not administer medicine to prisoners without consent.
7023,"&gt;administering medicine under the Socratic oath isn't invasive

In the modern times that includes willful knowledgeable consent of the patient."
7024,"And while I would superficially agree, history has shown time and time again that when you relax medical rights for prisoners atrocities happen."
7025,"Also, the socratic oath is a teacher thing, the hypocritic oath is a doctor thing."
7026,And you've made a great point about invasive vs non-invasive medicine.
7027,Injections are invasive.

7039,People are bad at math
7040,This is a drop in the bucket in terms of California’s overall budget (an excess of 200 billion a year).
7041,That’s like .05% of the annual budget.
7042,Similar to what Ohio did with their $5 million lottery.
7043,I believe in their case it was .03%.
7044,Public health is definitely a worthwhile investment and Ohio has shown these incentives to work.

&gt; One limitation of our study was the relatively small sample size and the predominantly young population, which lessen generalization of the results."
7191,"Also, because of the cross-sectional design, we could not obtain baseline or longitudinal serum samples."
7192,"For the 7 asymptomatic participants in our study, we evaluated antibody responses at 2 and 5 months after infection; 5/7 (71%) had positive ELISA results at 2 months after infection, 4/7 (57.1%) had positive ELISA results at 5 months after infection, and all had neutralizing antibodies at 2 and 5 months after infection (1,7)."

7385,A three day lockdown last week would have had less impact than a week long shutdown this week.
7386,"Unfortunately, the state government does not have the political capital to play it safe."
7387,The federal government should have done a better job securing and rolling out the vaccine.

7389,I also don't understand how we allow a full MCG without anyone wearing a mask.
7390,Surely wearing a mask in a 50k+ crowd is a tiny sacrifice to make.
7391,Trend on this subreddit I've noticed since the CDC reversal has been to downvote anything that reminds people there's still a pandemic going on for a lot of the world.

7458,I don't see a problem with this if they have a job that doesn't allow them to self isolate.
7459,"Us expendable workers have been working at risk to ourselves this entire pandemic and at least in the USA it never felt like anyone brothered about us except at the beginning when they thought we would all jump ship, and now at the tail end where they learned they need to pay us more to work."
7460,Wow!
7461,Pretty much on point.
7462,If Coronavirus had any sentience I would imagine it loves all of this.
7463,Heck maybe it’s not a virus and it’s a brain parasite that hijacks the brain to make you behave in a way that benefits the parasite?
7464,I kid.

7469,"In my hometown the *median* age of death from Covid is 82, yet national surveys suggest people under 40 think their changes of dying if they get Covid are around 20%, which is orders of magnitude higher than the real number."
7470,The fear mongering has taken a toll.
7471,Her?
7472,Hahaha totally spat my Coke out
7473,It's good to see so many countries slowly starting to wake back up and get moving again as we get vaccines out there.
7474,I'm excited to see where we're at globally in the late fall after six more months of pumping vaccines into arms.
7475,This almost sounds like the plot to the original Rainbow Six novel.

7479,Maybe by North American standards but we don’t have houses etc well designed for the actually cold parts of Australia and it’s dam near impossible to buy warm enough clothes except down jackets from like 2 brands here.
7480,I live in Victoria in a place where it snows every year a few times and I’ve already had to use my ice scraper for my car windscreen in the last few weeks and it still technically autumn.

7484,I was referring specifically to Japanese athletes.
7485,Sorry I want clear on that point.
7486,"Why are we giving athletes preferred treatment over say, a teacher who is around children daily?"
7487,&gt;I hope this is contained very quickly so life go can back to full normal again after this 7 days.
7488,Lockdowns cannot continue occurring forever.
7489,Covid will always exist.
7490,Canada has given at least 1 vaccine to well over 50% of the population.
7491,Australia?
7492,Like 15%.
7493,"Australia is doing well with lockdowns, but they are not sustainable."
7494,"The new phase of COVID is vaccinating the populace, and Australia is failing in that regard."
7495,They are literally worse than any other developed country.
7496,"Funny how statements that start with ""Apparently"" never have a source."
7497,"Thank you for the kind words and advice, I might ask my GP if the blood test thing is possible if I go for the 2nd jab, I just feel abit left behind as all my friends and family are now all Pfizer jabbed and I'm sort of in limbo not knowing what to do and there doesn't seem to be any guidance on when Pfizer will be OK to get after AZ, like how many months etc."
7498,"Man, that overreaction to the AZ side effects from EU officials was a mess that likely set back countries primarily using that back months because of hesitancy 

It was a bad move to handle it with as little tact as they did"
7499,They were different.
7500,Most new cases in Australia occur in hotel quarantine.
7501,Ground zero?
7502,"Shoot, that'd be southwestern Virginia."
7503,"Have a friend whose hard-core anti covid vaccine and all she does is post about how she and her kids won't get it, especially after ""recent findings""."
7504,Worst part?
7505,You have people commenting on it saying they work in Healthcare and won't either...which I personally think should lead to their termination from their Healthcare job.
7506,Give the family a medal then and build a monument.
7507,At the very least.
7508,People were trusting these vaccines and believing they were doing their duty to the society.
7509,Australia will be fine.
7510,This isn't even the biggest outbreak since the second wave.
7511,That and lockdowns actually work here.
7512,Exactly.
7513,It drives me insane how people bang on about blood clots.
7514,It’s a tiny chance.
7515,You have a bigger chance of getting cancer due to bad food and or lifestyle.
7516,Nobody bats an eye about that.
7517,How about smoking?
7518,Who cares.
7519,Car fumes?
7520,Nah.
7521,"But fuck me if you take a tiny, TINY risk twice to help combat Covid and to protect yourself and others, you will be crucified."
7522,I am curious to know: So did this originate from within the country?
7523,Or was brought in by travellers?
7524,"So when most the people are vaccinated, and foreigners are allowed in, if there's then even one case of covid will everyone will freak out and shut everything down again?"
7525,Lockdowns work everywhere if they are actual lockdowns.

7530,I had AZ twice and would do it again.
7531,It’s a no brainer.
7532,Would I have chosen another vaccine if I had the option?
7533,Probably.
7534,But that does not deter me from taking it if I don’t have that option.
7535,Im between 30-40 years old.
7536,The scaremongering is off the charts.
7537,Didn’t realise this was an anti vacc sub!
7538,Bye
7539,Pieces of absolute shit
7540,"Yeah, I have terrible health anxiety too, and to be honest, if I had known about the blood clot issue *before* the first shot (I got AZ), I would have waited for something else."
7541,"But since I already had the first shot, and I had some other reasons to take the second one, I did it."
7542,What helped me was that I did a blood test every week after to check my platelet levels - this ultimately relieved some of my anxiety.
7543,I'm now exactly one month out of my second shot.
7544,"But yeah, to realize after getting the first shot that it is related to blood clots was not a fun experience."
7545,"And don't feel bad about not getting the shot (letting you community down), your mental health is also very important."
7546,I hope you do get to eventually adopt.
7547,My SIL adopted her oldest son and their daughter and I honestly CANNOT imagine our family without those two.
7548,:) GOOD LUCK!!!!!!!!
7549,"SIL felt very strongly about wanting to adopt vs having a child, because MIL was adopted."
7550,"SIL and her SO ended up having a child of their own, but only after they'd adopted Oldest Nephew."
7551,"Pregnancy and childbirth were so traumatic for SIL that she was like, ""Fuck this shit."
7552,"I am NOT putting myself through this again."""
7553,and they were just going to have the two boys.
7554,"Then one day, when Middle Nephew was like, IDK, about 18 mos old or so, this lady from another dept at my SIL's husband's work comes up and asks if it's OK if they discuss what adoption is like, how it worked with the adoption agency they went through, etc."
7555,"He's like, ""Sure."
7556,"No prob."""
7557,Turns out the lady's daughter is pregnant and wants to give the child up for adoption.
7558,"SIL and her SO talk to the birthmom, walk her through what it was like for them going through the adoptive process, etc and in the end, Birthmom falls in love with SIL and her SO."
7559,She wants THEM to adopt her baby.
7560,"SIL was like, ""Uh....Hubs and I need to discuss this first."""
7561,Which they did.
7562,"They weren't planning to adopt again but they talked about it and stuff and decided, ""Yeah."
7563,"We gonna DO THIS."""
7564,Which is how they ended up adopting their daughter.

7566,"Just to put this into perspective:

“Frail patients can benefit from vaccination because they are at great risk of serious illness and even death if they become infected with the covid-19 virus,” said Sigurd Hortemo, senior medical consultant at the Norwegian Medicines Agency."
7567,"“Nevertheless, the expert group believes that, for some of these frail patients, common adverse reactions may have contributed to a more serious course of their disease.”

The group noted that more thorough assessment of the benefits and risks of vaccination could have been made for some very frail elderly people, particularly during the first few weeks of the vaccine’s use."
7568,"People with a very short life expectancy have little to gain from being vaccinated, it said, noting a genuine risk that the time of death will be brought forward and that they will experience adverse reactions to the vaccine in the last days of their life.”"
7569,"Not sure, but there's no reason why we shouldn't have done both."
7570,Particularly because the states were the ones to contain the virus.
7571,"Whereas the federal government's job has only been to secure vaccines, and they couldn't even do that."
7572,This post appears to be about vaccines.

7778,95% efficacy does not mean you have a 5% chance of catching COVID.
7779,The 95% number is calculated by dividing the number of people who tested positive from the vaccinated study group by the number of people who caught it from the control group.
7780,"There were 43,660 in the study, split into two groups (vaccinated and placebo) of 21,830."
7781,"[Of the placebo group, 162 caught COVID, of the vaccinated group 8 did](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/12/13/learning/what-does-95-effective-mean-teaching-the-math-of-vaccine-efficacy.html)."
7782,Keep in mind this study was done last fall when the general population was not vaccinated at all and cases were **much** higher.
7783,Currently the average case rate in the US is [7 per 100k](https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/2020/national/coronavirus-us-cases-deaths/).
7784,"So, let's say you would have a 100% chance of catching COVID being next to a particular unmasked unvaccinated individual had you not been vaccinated (which would never be the case either but let's just pretend), throw the vaccine into the equation, and your current odds of catching COVID would be 0.00035%, because remember not only do you have to be one of the unlucky ones for whom the vaccine doesn't work, that unmasked unvaccinated person next to you also has to have COVID to spread in the first place."

-low risk demo (healthy/young people haven’t been statistically dying from this."
7846,"My state, MN, it’s 3 total under 20 out of 100k cases which is consistent with the country)

-People are afraid because the vaxes are new and only were tested 8 months 

Every little incentive can help these people change there mind."
7847,"If enough people get vaccinated there, any outbreak won't spread too wide."

7855,"I got the vaccine as soon as I knew I was eligible for it, and being protected since that time is worth a lot more than $50."
7856,I have a medical condition that puts me at legitimately high risk for severe covid but the state of California explicitly doesn't recognize my condition as legitimate cause for vaccination.
7857,Fortunately my company operations manager informed me I qualified for the vaccine because of my not particularly risky profession.
7858,The vaccine rules have not been very well thought out.

8024,"They were indeed engineering coronavirus to be able to infect humans in the lab, that is known, so there is a possibility that this came from that lab, which is suspiciously close to ground zero."
8025,This is an incredibly inefficient use of money.
8026,$1 million (what Ohio is giving) is going to motivate almost as many people as $10 million.
8027,"In addition, Ohio is smart - they are doing the lotteries sequentially, so people see the winners, and then have time to react and get vaxed so they are ready for the next one."
8028,Giving out all the prizes at the same time loses a lot of the value.

8046,"Because my situation was unusual (I got two types of vaccines in the end), I thought it was important to share my experience."
8047,I had to call the CDC for guidance because it didn’t fully exist at the time.
8048,"I’m assuming it was thought that I was shit posting about Pfizer when really, I know I’m always at risk for allergies so it wasn’t all that surprising to me and frankly, I was still glad I got the shot because two weeks later I could relax."
8049,I see posts I’m suspicious of.
8050,Don’t really blame them.
8051,"The $50 gift cards are also a limited deal: they are giving away exactly 2 million, first come first served."
8052,"I don't know how fast they'll run out, as I can't find the exact data on how many first timers Cali vaccinates per day."
8053,"But looking at their recent numbers, it took about 19 days for Cali to vaccinate 2 million people (this could've been their first or second shot)."
8054,So that's a promo that might run out very quickly.
8055,"No, I'm saying I'll stay home - not stay home ""except""."
8056,I'm also not telling anyone else they shouldn't if they're out and about and feel the need to.
8057,I'm literally just saying that *I* would prefer risking catching a cold than wearing a mask all the time.
8058,"To be clear, under current CDC guidelines, you don't need to quarantine as long as you remain asymptomatic, but your girlfriend needs to isolate (from you and the rest of the world) until she is no longer contagious."

8063,"The people who died today, by and large, got COVID a few weeks ago."
8064,"(I vaguely recall hearing four weeks ago, on average?)"
8065,"To prevent that, they would've needed to get vaccinated at least two weeks before that for some protection, and at least five weeks before for maximum protection."
8066,"So, the people dying today chose not to get vaccinated *around April 15th* when there were huge lines and young people weren't eligible in some states, or even *March 25th* when most people weren't eligible most places."
8067,I'm not going to blame people under age 65 for not getting vaccinated back then.
8068,"That’s why I said dump, not jump"
8069,They noted the data anomaly on the link you provided.
8070,"Sorry, just because they aren’t willing to fix bad data, and the CDC does, doesn’t mean 900+ people died yesterday."
8071,The numbers are much lower and I think overstating the situation so significantly is misleading.
8072,Science learns over time.
8073,This isn't about being right...or well it is....but you get more data and update your hypothesis.
8074,This isn't FOXNEWS.
8075,The primary goal was to get the pandemic under control regardless of origin.
8076,Now that that's happened there's time to review and if necessary hold people accountable (big time if it was man made).
8077,If there was evidence of a lab leak it was destroyed before or soon after china told the world about the outbreak.
8078,Agreed wholeheartedly.
8079,Basically how about spend money of homeless not “waste” it
8080,Exactly.
8081,The problem with any flu comparison is that this is a crazy virus.
8082,It’s not in the same family as influenza.
8083,I think you're missing the point.
8084,"If it is normal to wear a mask when sick, that means you get sick less often."
8085,"Because... less illness spreads to others, as they spread less viral particles when sick."
8086,"We know when you say youll stay home you still gotta stop for 10 mins at the store, you prob still will go to work, can't miss, and really you probably go to work when feeling better but still have some symptoms."
8087,"Pre covid sure that was acceptable, but afterward if others and hell even if you yourself just wear a mask when your sick say stopping at the store, or when you go back to work to early, or whatever excuse puts you in contact with others, is it really that big of an inconvenience for 5 or 10 mins?"
8088,Or a couple days at work?
8089,"We effectively eliminated the flu, which does kill 60k people yearly in the states alone."
8090,Colss suck to.
8091,"I don't think anyone is being unreasonable going forward if you are sick stay home, but there will be a time people will be back at work sick and going shopping etc sick."
8092,By simply wearing a mask the rare time you are sick maybe once a year(and if everyone does it maybe once every 3 years!)
8093,For a couple days that bad?
8094,"I even think its excessive for the entire flu season, but other countries at least try to be polite and if you are sick, its polite to mask up."
8095,Pre covid.
8096,"I understand, and I don’t think you should be downvoted."
8097,That’s not the way we are going to convince folks like yourself.
8098,Just know that the FDA is not waiting on more safety data.
8099,They have had solid data (especially with mRNA) for &gt; a year now.
8100,(Phase 1 participants got dosed in April 2020) But they must wait until they can prove it is effective for a minimum length of time.
8101,EUA is not a safety skip.
8102,"But do your research at your own speed, and if you still want to wait (I hope you don’t!)"
8103,please continue to wear a mask and socially distance to keep yourself and others who are in your same position safe.

8226,&gt;The officials declined to describe the new evidence.
8227,"But the revelation that they are hoping to apply an extraordinary amount of computer power to the question of whether the virus accidentally leaked from a Chinese laboratory suggests that the government may not have exhausted its databases of Chinese communications, the movement of lab workers and the pattern of the outbreak of the disease around the city of Wuhan."

8325,"Yeah buddy, having the whole family over for a cookout."
8326,We’re all well past our two weeks post shot 2
8327,This argument is extremely self centered.
8328,"Having the vaccine not only prevents you from becoming seriously ill, it also dramatically reduces shedding of the virus and therefore minimises infections."
8329,The guards and personnel wore surgical masks at the time as the residents were not know at the time to be infected.
8330,It is the National guidelines but in Victoria leave our lessons and the staff (not sure about residents) wear N95 masks.
8331,Massive upgrade in these medihotel ventilation systems as well.
8332,"Asian Americans were also being threatened, harassed, and assaulted because bigoted idiots don’t know any better."

* This website is a really good summary of everything about the covid vaccine: https://www.acog.org/clinical/clinical-guidance/practice-advisory/articles/2020/12/vaccinating-pregnant-and-lactating-patients-against-covid-19 The ACOG expects based on the mechanism of mRNA vaccines that the safety and efficacy profile for pregnant individuals would be similar to that observed in non pregnant individuals."
8435,ACOG also mentions how the covid vaccines are not live vaccines.
8436,Live vaccines are not recommended for pregnant women as those are increased risk to the baby.
8437,It's worth noting that other vaccines (like flu and tdap) are highly recommended during pregnancy.
8438,"* Studies in animals receiving moderna, pfizer, and J&amp;J vaccine before or during pregnancy found no safety concerns according to the CDC."
8439,"https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/recommendations/pregnancy.html
 
* The vsafe app is how the CDC is tracking pregnant women."
8440,"So far, they are finding no correlation with pregnancy complications of women who were vaccinated compared to the general background rates of what is typical."
8441,"30,494 pregnant women have registered on the app when this report came out: https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/acip/meetings/downloads/slides-2021-02/28-03-01/05-covid-Shimabukuro.pdf No unexpected pregnant or infant outcomes have been observed related to covid vaccination during pregnancy."
8442,"You can also see these findings summarized here as well: https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2104983

* Because of the above findings in the New England Journal of Medicine, the CDC recommends that pregnant women should get vaccinated."
8443,"https://www.wsj.com/articles/cdc-recommends-pregnant-women-receive-covid-19-vaccine-11619217983

* As of April 19, 2021, there's 94,000+ pregnant women vaccinated who have self reported on the Vsafe app."
8444,"https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/safety/vsafepregnancyregistry.html
 
* This one person study indicated that if a women gets vaccinated then she can pass the antibody to the baby."
8445,They found antibodies in her cord.
8446,She had one shot of the vaccine.
8447,"https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.02.03.21250579v1
 
* Here's another report of 20 women who got the vaccine and found antibodies in the cord."
8448,"https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.03.11.21253352v1
 
* Here's a report of 131 reproductive-age vaccine recipients (84 pregnant, 31 lactating, and 16 non-pregnant) and they found Vaccine-generated antibodies were present in all umbilical cord blood and breastmilk samples."
8449,"These women had similar immune responses to the vaccine as nonpregnant women, suggesting that the vaccine would be just as effective for them."
8450,"https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.03.07.21253094v1
 
* And here's a report from Florida of a vaccinated pregnant woman who they found antibodies for the baby as well."
8451,"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/baby-born-covid-antibodies-moderna-vaccine/?ftag=CNM-00-10aag7e
 
* The mRNA vaccine is extremely fragile (thus it's stored in cold temperatures) and short lived."
8452,It is extremely unlikely that any mRNA will be able to get into the baby or placenta.
8453,"https://www.uchicagomedicine.org/forefront/coronavirus-disease-covid-19/mrna-covid-19-vaccine-pregnancy-breastfeeding
 
* Conversely, there are multiple studies showing that contacting covid while pregnant and being symptomatic puts you at higher risk for cesarean delivery, preterm birth, hypertensive disorders of pregnancy, and postpartum hemorrhage."
8454,"https://www.nih.gov/news-events/news-releases/severe-covid-19-pregnancy-associated-preterm-birth-other-complications

* For example, here's a case study of how it's possible for covid to transfer to the baby via vertical transfusion."
8455,"In this particular case study, the mother was ""moderately sick"" with covid at week 21."
8456,"Two weeks after illness, an ultrasound scan detected abnormalities in the fetus, as described in the paper: ""Specific conditions included critical blood flow in the fetal umbilical artery, fetal growth restriction (1st percentile), right ventricular hypertrophy, hydropericardium, echo-characteristics of hypoxic-ischemic brain injury (leukomalacia in periventricular area) and intraventricular hemorrhage at the 25th week of gestation."""
8457,The mother delivered at week 26 prematurely and the child passed away at 1 day and 18 hours.
8458,"https://www.technologynetworks.com/proteomics/news/proteomics-confirms-vertical-transmission-of-sars-cov-2-from-mother-to-fetus-347012

* A study of more than 2,100 pregnant women across 18 countries worldwide has revealed that COVID-19 is associated with a higher risk of severe maternal and newborn complications than previously recognised."
8459,"Women with COVID-19 during pregnancy were over 50% more likely to experience pregnancy complications (such as premature birth, pre-eclampsia, admission to intensive care and death) compared to pregnant women unaffected by COVID-19."
8460,"Newborns of infected women were also nearly three times more at risk of severe medical complications, such as admission to a Neonatal Intensive Care Unit – mostly due to premature birth."
8461,"https://www.ox.ac.uk/news/2021-04-23-research-uncovers-high-risk-pregnant-women-covid-19
 
* Pfizer and Moderna have been studied to be effective against the NY variant."
8462,Pfizer and Moderna vaccines are only marginally less protective against the variant that devastated Britain.
8463,"https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/22/health/covid-ny-variant-vaccine.html

* If you're interested in vaccine safety over long term periods, I found this https://www.cdc.gov/vaccinesafety/concerns/concerns-history.html pretty eye opening."
8464,Vaccines have overall been very safe with very few recalls.
8465,"It's also worth mentioning that we don't question ""long term effects"" of other vaccines."
8466,"Yes, I know about the history of thalidomide."
8467,It's worth stating though that thalidomide wasn't approved by the FDA for pregnant women in the US as well as it forced drug companies to be even stricter in regards to their clinical trials.
8468,Regulations have grown a lot since then.
8469,Do all of the vaccinated Americans here have big plans for the holiday weekend?
8470,Vaccine cards and they can look it up in your health records.
8471,"That's odd, because in December the ""US was stupid and couldn't follow simple rules like Australia"" was the only reason for cases then..."
8472,"If they're food based, and are smart enough to hop on the delivery bandwagon, they'll make more money during lockdown, than not."
8473,I think you’ve vaccinated more of your population than Australia.
8474,This.
8475,"We were vaccinated on day 2, of 1B roll out."
8476,"12 weeks is next week, so unless you were 1A it’s pretty much next to impossible to have both."
8477,Brain fog crops up with a lot of chronic illnesses.
8478,Maybe with increased cases due to Covid we can get more researchers working on it.
8479,Aren't you in the EU scheme?
8480,"You should be getting quite a lot of vaccines, even more this month that Pfizer sends 50% more each week."
8481,In the Basque Country we are around 50% of adults with first shorts and 20% fully vaccinated
8482,I imagine this pays for itself even if it just keeps a few people out of the ICU.
8483,That's not even counting more abstract externalities like loss of productivity due to illness or shutting down schools because of an outbreak.
8484,"Vaccines are important in the long term sure, but as far as this outbreak goes, it will likely make little difference due to the time it takes for rollout, both jabs, and for immunity to kick in."
8485,Australia has had several small outbreaks like this before and has mostly gotten them under control.
8486,"While this isn't a sure thing, and this outbreak a concern, all the cases are linked so it's my belief that even without vaccines it is possible to keep the country relatively covid free."
8487,"The problem is that this only works by cutting us off from the rest of the world, and isn't viable long term."
8488,Let’s stop all business and travel because 30 people got sick.
8489,Mmmm sounds legit
8490,Adult staff can get vaccinated.
8491,Holy heck
8492,"It's all a failure of the Japanese government, especially given that (as I said) there are people who can legally administer the vaccine but are not."
8493,"However, if other nations and private corporations want to step up to vaccinate all athletes and staff so the games can happen, the *choices* of the Japanese government should have no bearing."
8494,This post appears to be about vaccines.

8497,*
8498,"Yep, but we never made a real lockdown, the president actively discourages social distancing and ridicules masks, the government is giving a ridiculous 150 BRL monthly check which is not enough for a single person to live for a month, they've also ignored several proposals from Pfizer for vaccines in late 2020."
8499,"It's so frustrating because we're actually pretty capable when it comes to vaccinating the population, Brazil has free universal healthcare, and in 2010 during the H1N1 epidemic we vaccinated 88 million people in 3 months, so if bolsonaro had half a brain we could've vaccinated way more than half the population by now."
8500,I want to go to the Chemist Warehouse.
8501,It's important to point out that they have no idea why there is a higher mortality rate.
8502,"It could be a viral variant, but it could also be lack of care, incorrect treatment, or the use of ""traditional medicine"" rather than modern medicine."
8503,"I’m in Melbourne and working from home is my new normal, I’ve barely been into the office since March last year."
8504,The story of why the 0 is next to the 9 is kind of interesting.
8505,If it's 17deg C i'm wearing a jumper/jacket and my warm shoes.
8506,"Well the comment I replied to said ""when everyone is vaccinated""."
8507,I don't know if that will happen but if we reach a degree of herd immunity any spread will be very circumscribed.
8508,I prefer those odds to not going down that path.
8509,In Australia we have bought time to get the jab and have not suffered like some other countries.
8510,"I don't need to know the whole future plan to trust we can manage it in the future, particularly with a population that actually complies with health directives."
8511,"It should be, but they decided to push it on the states."
8512,"And I guess they did what they could with existing infrastructure, but hotel quarantine is inherently flawed."
8513,"Every state should have a facility like the NT has, or the federal government should send everyone through there."
8514,"no, positive incentives work"
8515,I do not agree.
8516,"Fomite transmission of flu suffers from the same bad science that was exposed in this past year, based on an error in droplet size that carried forward for decades."
8517,"Any respiratory disease classified as one primarily transmitted by droplets should now be assumed by default to be spread primarily by aerosols, mostly at close range."
8518,Fomite transmission is very inefficient.
8519,"That aside, it was not thought to be a primary mode of transmission even prior to exposing the bad science at play."
8520,"[CDC says](https://www.cdc.gov/flu/about/disease/spread.htm):

&gt;People with flu can spread it to others up to about 6 feet away."
8521,"Most experts think that flu viruses spread mainly by droplets made when people with flu cough, sneeze or talk."
8522,These droplets can land in the mouths or noses of people who are nearby or possibly be inhaled into the lungs.
8523,"Less often, a person might get flu by touching a surface or object that has flu virus on it and then touching their own mouth, nose, or possibly their eyes."

8530,Let’s hope they roll out incentives on day 1 instead.
8531,Did you feel symptoms at any point?
8532,How many days total have you and partner been self isolating?
8533,They’ve stopped giving it entirely in Canada.
8534,If you got a first dose you’ll be able to get a second but they’re not vaccinating anyone new with AZ.
8535,I would have taken it but they never approved it for under 40s here and I’m a few years short.
8536,I had the same thought.
8537,In Quebec they predict 80% first dose by the end of June and are saying that we can start moving up our second doses in a couple weeks online.
8538,10% seems crazy low for Australia.

8556,Keeping your antibodies up all the time is inefficient and can lead to other problems (e.g.
8557,inflammation).
8558,What is important is that the body remembers how to make them again in case it is faced with the same pathogen again.
8559,How many indians have died again?
8560,Exactly
8561,But 4% of people in India will be bigger number then 3% of Australia.
8562,Can't use percent when comparing with second highest populated country.
8563,"Nah nah, that’s for a $50 gift card- which sucks for people who were vaccinated earlier- but the larger prizes are for anybody who has been vaccinated."
8564,"We had this last year in melbourne too, then they had to crack down and require special permits for only permitted workers to be going into work"

8569,"I doubt the data given to this company will amount to much, so it’s probably just a failed business venture, but who knows."
8570,I don't give a f*** even if I die.
8571,"But it's so strange to me that I only know 1 person that had bad version of covid, but doctor told her that was mostly because she had Pneumonia every year for 3 years  before covid started."
8572,"Every other person I know(and I know a lot of people) had very mild symptoms, like normal cold."
8573,Also I was working with someone who tested positive for covid and I didn't catch it.
8574,People who I'm delivering parcels to don't use masks and shit(I do use everything that is supposed to protect others) and people WERE positive.
8575,Most of the things are so inconsostent it's plain stupid to most people in my country(but thhat's also because we have bandit government).
8576,Sorry for my bad English.
8577,Have a nice day
8578,But there are vaccinated people getting symptomatic infections right now.

8599,&gt;though viral variants could dampen some of the protection they offer.
8600,I think *could* is key here.
8601,"A variant partially escaping could still mean 100% efficacy in preventing symptoms, because they don't know what the threshold for immunity is."
8602,"Also not sure why it even needs to be said unless you/they were just saying ""so still get vaccinated"" to which I whole-heartedly agree."
8603,Past infection + vaccination causes some pretty robust immunity.

8637,"This is the opinion of the immunologist that led the study...

&gt; The ability of some emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants to blunt the protective effects of antibodies means that additional immunizations may be needed to restore levels, says Ellebedy, a B-cell immunologist at Washington University in St. Louis, Missouri, who led the study,  “My presumption is we will need a booster.”"
8638,Sucked in Victoria jk much love from Queensland!

8660,Politicians...
8661,Well people were still allowed to claim it came from the Chinese wet markets so I'm not sure I get your point
8662,One week of lockdown is unsustainable?
8663,Other countries have had months of restrictions and thousands of deaths.
8664,Having a week long lockdown so the virus can be eliminated until the population has been vaccinated is the best option by miles.
8665,I have a question about self isolation.
8666,I live with my partner and two weeks ago he had contact with a person who was sick with COVID.
8667,"That person didn’t know that he was sick at the time but 2 days later he messaged my partner saying he was feeling sick, however, covid test came back negative."
8668,At that point me and my partner we both were feeling fine (we live together and both work from home).
8669,After another two days that person messages my partner saying he took another test and it came positive.
8670,Now at this point my partner started feeling a bit ill (I mean nothing serious just some cough here and there).
8671,"However, one night it was very cold and I accidentally left the window in our bedroom open so when we both woke up it was freezing."
8672,My partner woke up feeling a bit ill. For some reason I didn’t really think about that contact he had and thought he caught a cold.
8673,After that my partner’s health started to worsen.
8674,By the end of the week his fever rose to 37.5 C and he kept coughing.
8675,"But approximately on Saturday the fever went away and only came back on Tuesday this week, however, now it was 38.5 C. We finally took two covid tests each on Wednesday and they came back positive."
8676,We didn’t have any direct contact with anyone so that is not an issue.
8677,What bothers me though is that tomorrow will be 14 days since that contact he had and I have been asymptomatic this whole time.
8678,How much longer should I wait till I can leave self isolation?
8679,I was thinking waiting till Monday but he is thinking of doing an official testing today and that will put another 14 days of isolation for both of us.
8680,4 weeks of self isolation does not seem very logical to me.
8681,"Please pardon any mistakes, English is not my first language."
8682,while lockdowns affect 100% of the population.
8683,"And only a small percentage of those infected with covid, died or got some noteworthy damage."
8684,This is great news.
8685,Right now instead of being 50% partially vaccinated that means the number is higher due to the people that have recovered.
8686,"I mean nominal values don’t mean anything without comparative scale, 6% is pretty damn close"
8687,We're going to have to start exporting because most people who are willing to get the vaccine have already gotten at least one dose.
8688,What is fair and what is right can be very different things.
8689,Coronavac is also known as Sinovac.
8690,Maybe they can be used in minks.

8697,"""The doses available will be 20 million,"" said Figliuolo, and each region will have to adjust the number of doses, but what we must ""avoid is the run-up between regions to get more vaccines."

8700,"OVER 60 - ""To date we have administered nearly 33 million doses, of which 21 million and 800 thousand first dose and the remainder, about 11 million and 200 thousand people vaccinated - Figliuolo added - On the over 80 we have exceeded 90%, and Umbria is on target, over 70 we are above 80 percent, and Umbria is on target, over 60 on a national level we must all grow because we are around 62-63%."

8707,My point is there is a lot more at play with the spread of the virus beyond politics.
8708,"Population density, geography, **seasonality** (especially for places with cold winters), socioeconomic, and so on..."
8709,"Yet, this sub always sums it down to ""dumb America, smart everywhere else"""
8710,Australian cities have had several lockdowns like this and been able to open up after a week with no more cases.
8711,"Perth was locked down for a week just over a month ago, Brisbane before that, etc."
8712,Thats just asking for the next wave to hit.
8713,"Yes, I have an Australian friend and she's complaining about the lockdowns but she doesn't want to get a vaccine either."
8714,"Yes, 17 degrees is cold enough for me to bundle up."
8715,"It's 12.8 outside right now, and I'm not looking forward to taking my dogs outside and leaving this heated room to go to bed."
8716,We are weak to cold.
8717,"My mum didn't move here from England until she was in her twenties, and she was cold and bundled up in 22 degree weather earlier today."
8718,only 10 percent vaccinated?
8719,What is going on with that?
8720,I am in Canada and we are at 55% of the total population with one dose and that's with us just starting to do younger people.
8721,In Ontario 62% of people 12+ have one dose at least.

8730,You've literally put words in my mouth and being a dick about it at the same time.
8731,So we can agree it's a ghost town?

8787,"The vaccines' earliest trials completed in July of 2020, and large scale (Phase 3) trials didn't complete until November of 2020."
8788,Why do people keep expecting scientists to know if it will last 2 years when there are ZERO people who have had it for even a year yet?
8789,"The [data at 6 months](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/nejmc2103916) back in April looked pretty good and has led to the comments of ""a year or two"", but there remains no way to be scientifically certain of the future until we get there."

8861,"The reason he reversed it was because all neighboring states were allowing for it anyways, and the idiots who were unvaccinated and refused masks would just drive across the borders, catch the virus and bring it back into the state, and that beat the purpose for the continued mask mandates."

8929,"I mean, you could argue to wait for the full two weeks until after that second dose, but you have to remember that the ""two weeks after the second dose"" evaluation point is just what the trial was originally designed for - anyone can look at [the case charts](https://www.msn.com/en-us/health/medical/this-chart-shows-how-well-the-pfizer-covid-19-vaccine-works-after-one-dose/ar-BB1bScjg) and see the vaccine taking effect well before the second dose."

8985,Actually the most effective thing is social distancing.
8986,"There is a difference between ""we lose immunity over time to the SARS-CoV-2 variants which we were exposed to either by infection or vaccination"" and ""the virus mutates in such a fashion that the antibodies we have or can readily produce no longer can effectively bind it to signal for our immune system to neutralize it""."
8987,"What she is talking about is the latter (which is not a guaranteed thing to happen), but it seems like a lot of people are confusing it for the former."
8988,"You can think of the antibody like a lock, and a specific virus variant (or variants) is like a key."
8989,"When antibody (lock) and virus (key) bind sufficiently to each other, it signals an immune response that leads to neutralization of the virus."
8990,"This article shows that the specific ""locks"" we have for the variants we were exposed to (through infection or vaccination) do not appear likely to go away."
8991,"However, if the virus mutates enough, you can think of it like a ""key"" changing its shape enough that it no longer fits into the particular ""lock"" we have, and therefore our immune system isn't primed to neutralize it."
8992,"The question is how likely is the virus ""key"" able to mutate sufficiently enough that it no longer is bound readily by the antibody, i.e., that the ""key"" no longer fits into the ""lock""."
8993,"And the answer to this is ""we don't know""."
8994,"Many researchers have suggested that coronaviruses mutate relatively slowly, so there is a possibility that we can get enough of the population immunized before it can mutate in a way that evades our defenses (which would mean it's eliminated)."
8995,Or a new variant could pop up suddenly that our vaccines and prior immunity are no match for.
8996,"But again, we don't know what will happen."
8997,Anyone that acts assuredly like they know the answer one way or another is merely talking hot air.
8998,I support science and vaccination but this vaccine passport thing is realllllly bad.

9124,I'm not sure off the top of my head what the latest thinking is on b117 and whether or not those contradictions have been resolved.

9140,Do we get to count the vaccinations under age 18 toward it even though they aren't in the denominator?
9141,Or is the goal now 70% of those 12+ because we allowed more people to get vaccinatated?
9142,Why do ineligible people not get counted; do they not spread the disease at all?

9439,Luckily we’re now 67% with at least 1 dose of the vaccine so it should only go down from there.
9440,India is probably responsible for that since the government is actively denying deaths and upset at this making international news
9441,Yep.... that's why the loss of life is astronomical in younger people vs what lockdowns managed to achieve for 70-80 year olds globally... whom are almost reaching if not already surpassing the average life expectancy per country.

9446,This has been one of my biggest wonders with the snap lockdowns like this
9447,Thank you for sharing 🙏🏼.
9448,I’m frustrated because one of my good friend’s doctor keeps telling her to wait... but everything I’ve been reading in the stats and studies seems to indicate that there’s no risk to the fetus or mama (whereas Covid poses serious health risks to the mama).
9449,"I still wish, though, that rather than telling people their fears are silly, we acknowledged their fears and actually comforted them with the stats that are actually good news!"
9450,(I don’t mean “we” by anyone in particular.
9451,Just all over the Internet I see people calling those not taking the vaccine idiots.
9452,"And trust me, those kinds of insults are only going to make people’s guards go up more."
9453,People are valid in being mistrusting of certain governments; people are valid for questioning what goes into their bodies.
9454,"Rather than steamrolling over them, which I’ve seen a tonne of, why not validate their concerns and THEN respond with the science &amp; data that’s actually good news for them?)"
9455,That was the intent of my original comment.
9456,"Not everyone who’s vaccine-hesitant is an anti-vaxxer or Covid-denier, or even “unintelligent”."
9457,They’re scared... and this world has given us plenty of reasons to be scared.
9458,"Reassuring and speaking directly to their fears vs ostracizing them and shit-piling all over them can do more harm than good, in my opinion."
9459,This article is about all of the evidence they have and haven't looked at yet.
9460,How do you know there is no evidence?
9461,Virginia's 7 day average is 360 cases and all restrictions for capacity have been lifted as of today.
9462,Masks are not required if you are vaccinated.
9463,"I suppose the risk of blood clots from the AZ vaccine, low as it is, does not look very good in comparison to the risk of covid, if there are next to no cases."
9464,"Several EU countries have suspended AZ and Janssen entirely and decided to go with mRNA vaccines, even though it's slower and the epidemic is much worse compared to Australia."
9465,You just changed what I said.
9466,"I said “rest of THE time”, eg when we’re not in lock down we are covid free"
9467,"I fudged my birthday on there, hope that's enough lol"
9468,Winter starts in June but really starts in July.

But we do have 35 celcoois degrees days in summer"
9470,"To the Australians here, are you OK with this?"

9472,Are you not vaccinating people?
9473,FDA approved?

9475,"Vaccination has just opened up to people 30 and over age group where I am, couldn’t get a booking slot 582 people all online at the same time as me trying to book."

9484,I'm sure that is playing a role in worse outcomes as well.
9485,Limited immune system resources.
9486,"Once the infection is cleared, it eventually stops producing high levels of antibodies to that infection so it's ready to address other, new infections."
9487,"If the original pathogen is encountered again, the B-cells and BMPCs are ready to produce high levels of those antibodies again."
9488,This is baseline immune response and should have been assumed from the start.
9489,"When you get a measles vaccine, you are immune for life, but the antibodies definitely wane after the vaccine."
9490,You don't walk around your whole life with high circulating levels of measles antibodies.
9491,This immunology has been known for decades.
9492,In no way should this news be surprising.
9493,Is it even legal to require people to get vaccinated at Kroger’s in order to win?
9494,Seems it would violate the “purchase not necessary” rule.

9501,How does it feel to be spreading communist propaganda.
9502,They do not like to be called out like that
9503,The reality though is that Japan has managed this horribly.
9504,"Knowing this event was coming, they should have been aggressively vaccinating to minimize the risk of a dangerous outbreak."
9505,They’ve had months.
9506,They also needed to create much better management plans for holding the event.
9507,"The playbooks have been criticized for relying on unproven apps for tracing, testing at a level Japan may not be able to handle and generic plans that aren’t specific  for each event."
9508,"If Japan had managed its own outbreak more effectively, combined with high levels of vaccination, I think there would be a reasonably high level of support in the country for the Olympics."
9509,"Right now, medical systems are overwhelmed in some areas."
9510,Wait.... people are happy about this?

9515,Thank you
9516,Question cause I’m curious - how is Australia’s vaccination effort going?
9517,Are you guys waiting on doses or are things moving along?
9518,Generally decided to stop wearing a mask as I walk to my commuter bus.
9519,Still need to wear one at work and on the bus.
9520,My neighborhood is still about 90% masked by my count but I'm honestly fed up.
9521,"I got my first dose in December 2020, I'm past done if I don't need one."
9522,I still put it on entering buildings though.
9523,I don't feel like accidentally starting some trouble.
9524,McChicken *mcmansion
9525,I'm quite satisfied with it.
9526,"We have been lucky yes, but assuming we can get vaccinated we stand a pretty good chance of being able to return to something like the before times."
9527,"Perhaps some good things will remain, such as WFH and a general consciousness that our actions can affect others in unforeseen ways."
9528,"I don't know exactly what the future holds, you don't either."
9529,If you want to worry about it feel free but don't expect me to join in.
9530,"There are people who can't come back to Aus due to flight caps

Loved ones who can't see their partners."
9531,It's a good approach but not without other costs
9532,"The implication is that all natural infections will produce long-lasting immunity in almost all people, regardless of severity."
9533,"While the circulating antibody titers wane, this study continues to find B-cells and bone marrow plasma cells (BMPCs) which are ready to produce more SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies if the virus is ever encountered again."
9534,Yeah last time I checked there were like ?23 or so reasons to leave your home in Ontario?
9535,"In Melbourne there are only 5, one of which is to get vaccinated."
9536,"Good, now the Christian antivax people know what it feels like"
9537,Discount chemist looks like a fun store
9538,I never understood this.
9539,Why don’t they use one hotel for all the people coming back on day x.
9540,People who come back x+1 go to a different hotel.
9541,Rotate a bunch of hotels.
9542,Everyone in the hotel waits together for the 14 days.
9543,Then they all leave at the same time.
9544,"If someone tests positive, then they remove the positive person and the timer resets for the remaining people in the hotel."
9545,"Once everyone leaves, the hotel is cleaned, waits empty for 3 days, and starts the process again."
9546,"When you have people coming and going, you’re just increasing the chances of infection between people since a hotel has a lot of common space."
9547,Tests data can only show if your 3 days infected since there is a period where your infected but undetectable.
9548,"These rates are very troubling, I can't see how the world can continue giving Adenovirus based vaccines to anyone in a risk category for these blood clots, given the comparison with the adverse outcomes of covid and the availability of other vaccines."
9549,Assuming your workplace cares.
9550,"Mine has decided that they ""can't"" ask about anyone's vaccine status, customer or employee."
9551, But doctors *are* looking at the figures.
9552,I'm inclined to trust their advice and guidance more than random Redditors or The Guardian.
9553,But locking down shouldn't be necessary.
9554,It should be a last resort.
9555,"Containing it with good public information, high testing rates and contact tracing is how an outbreak should be contained."
9556,"Yes, a lockdown will contain an outbreak but it should be a last resort."
9557,Not a political cover.
9558,Couldn't that also mean people will just gather inside more instead of going outside?
9559,"Given France is on the UKs amber list, this makes litterly no difference to anyone in the UK or France."
9560,"Yup, but I only commented bc of the usernamechecksout memes :-)) 

Sorry but we really need some fun on this sub."
9561,This week we had only six BioNTech doses for our patients to give.

9564,What does it matter if your a covid nurse?
9565,Do you live in Ontario?
9566,"Because If you don't, you can fuck right off yourself."
9567,I've been stuck at home and closed my business because of this 18 month lockdown/stay at home order/ everything is FUCKING SHUT DOWN.
9568,"Its only worse for small businesses if your next step is ""even bigger shut down""."
9569,"My area ended the lockdown early and hasn't reinstated, which has worked well for small businesses"
9570,"&gt; So another person (traveler B) who was also staying at that quarantine hotel, opened their door for a short duration (1 min) apparently the air from the traveler A's room blew into traveler B's room."
9571,"So... the ""quarantine hotels"" are actually little ""incubators,"" huh?"
9572,Hmmm it’s definitely because the federal government fucked the rollout and less so due to hesitancy/feelings of unnecessary(not to say there isn’t a little bit of that).
9573,Im in a priority group and have been waiting MONTHS now to get an appointment.
9574,"Fuck Scumo, a drunk three year old could organise this better."
9575,Those are averages.
9576,They seem high because it may be low 20s in the afternoon but below 10 at night.
9577,Our winters are also damp so it feels colder than it really is.
9578,No one is forcing anyone to reveal private information.
9579,"If you do, and are vaccinated, you get a discount."
9580,"If you don’t want to reveal your status, that’s cool, and here’s your ticket price."
9581,Government and companies are offering lottery prizes to get people to take a life saving vaccine.
9582,We are screwed as a species.

9586,"But I see tons of gatherings, people outside, loads of parties."
9587,Traffic is normal.
9588,Yeah that’s not gonna happen with elections coming up.
9589,"I can't tell you how many people I've met that think they know everything possible about the vaccine and all the ""dangerous side effects"" because they are a registered nurse or some other random healthcare worker."
9590,"I'm sorry, I didn't realize they had to spend 10+ years studying an extremely specific and complicated field, oh wait I'm thinking of epidemiologist's nevermind /s."
9591,Man this is tough to see for any city
9592,I’m going to university on the US right now and I’m really hoping that they lift the quarantine requirements for those who are fully vaccinated by some point this summer.
9593,I just want to visit my family now that we’ve all been vaccinated.

9599,They and Asia are going to suffer from the success of their control measures.
9600,When they reopen even slightly they are going to get hit bad and it is going to take them months to vaccinate.
9601,"Exponential growth, bruh."
9602,"Even though I laughed at first, and even though I think people who don't get vaccinated when they can are selfish idiots, I think this sounds kind of scary, slippery slope wise."

9609,Taiwan’s CFR before this wave was just above 0.1% and now it is just above 1%.
9610,That could suggest they are missing lots of cases especially since this wave was detected less than 2 weeks ago.
9611,It could also just be because people who travel internationally tend to be younger and tea house visitors tend to be older though so the positivity rate would be very helpful.
9612,If they haven't examined it how the fuck do they know it has anything to do with the virus?
9613,"They're basically announcing they're ready to concoct whatever story the administration wants, and people are just going to eat it up."

9615,"You seem to think he did nothing but dine at the French Laundry until this recall happened, and then he governed well... or sends out freebies, because of Schwarzenegger beating Davis back when rolling blackouts and rising energy bills happened (which neither did much of)."
9616,That’s a lot of just detached from reality assumptions to reach your final assumption.
9617,"He’s a governor who does governing work since the day he took office, it just doesn’t get reported on, except for the gossipy crap, and now everything he does governing must be because of the recall that is not remotely similar to a Schwarzenegger event other than “eh it could be.”"
9618,Short term is weeks or months.
9619,We are now a year on after already having one of the worlds strictest and longest lockdowns and there is no end in sight.
9620,Still repeatedly locking down due to quarantine failures and abismal vaccination rates.
9621,Meanwhile states like Texas and Florida are operating as normal.
9622,Australia's policy is a failure and saved only by the fact it's an isolated island in the South Pacific which can completely control it's borders.

9702,"If that happens, people will die."
9703,Elective surgeries get cancelled because there's no capacity.
9704,Businesses like warehouses and manufacturing will be forced to slow or stop because of outbreaks in their facilities.
9705,"Schools will have to pivot to online learning, otherwise those workers bring the virus home and the children spread it at school, which then infect other workers in other sectors."
9706,Restaurants and bars will need to be closed.
9707,The economy is going to be kicked in the balls if spreads unchecked.

9710,"I haven't seen my family and some of my friends in COVID hotspots for 18 months, because of the shit response from the provincial government here in Ontario, Canada, who took far too long to do anything, and bungled what they did do."

9728,Though ...
9729,"I'm not sure why they can't delay it one year, or two years..."
9730,I'm not sure what the argument against that is.
9731,"Anyway, there's a lot of pressure from those who have spent the last decade training to get there to be able to attend."
9732,All of those people have been vaccinated (or possibly will have been by the time  the games begin).
9733,"There's also the small army of support staff that travel with every competitor, who will need to be vaccinated also, and everyone in Japan who is involved in the production."
9734,"This means that it's actually *fairly* safe for the games to take place, on the basis that everyone involved is vaccinated, but it would also be sensible to err on the side of caution regardless and isolate the olympic village from the rest of Japan, and not allow anyone to watch live."
9735,"Actually, it's already very unlikely that there will be anyone watching it live."
9736,"From what I've read, tickets have been sold, but nobody wants to do that because of the risk involved."
9737,"As long as the ability exists to be able to isolate the facility, so that everyone working or competing there stays within the boundaries, and does not interact with anyone or anything outside of the village, and in the event of an outbreak, they agree to wait it out and stay isolated for 14+ days, then..."

9750,what country is trying to get pfizer and needs to get it from a different 3rd party country instead of dealing with pfizer/biontech directly?
9751,"i'm open to learning  

UN / COVAX excluding."
9752,What an absolutely ludicrous and insensitive comment.
9753,It means 200 million...the 20 million figure is for people currently waiting on their second dose....Can you read?
9754,&gt;20 million doses are also needed by mid-july.....who have received the first dose of the vaccine to complete the second dose on schedule.
9755,This title is wrong.
9756,It will just encourage people not to take vaccine if they had COVID
9757,I believe there was some sort of agreement amongst EU countries to open vaccination to all adults sometime in June.
9758,I believe they are just sticking generally to that plan.
9759,I doubt Germany will open it to all starting the 1st of June.
9760,Maybe they aim the 29th?
9761,Idk.
9762,But are you sure they’re really still giving a first dose only to 70+?
9763,That sounds like either there are A LOT of 70+ or they are much behind the rest of the country.
9764,wait.. then how about DNA vaccines?
9765,"(IIRC Innovio was one of them)
  
does other vector based vaccines has the same problem?"
9766,"The guidance [here](https://www.government.nl/topics/coronavirus-covid-19/visiting-the-netherlands-from-abroad/exemptions-to-the-entry-ban/eu-entry-ban-exemption-categories) says:

9767,That was a while ago and we've been making the same vaccine that got blocked here for a while now.
9768,"It's more the ""no rush"" commentary from the PM and the lack of effective procurement of Pfizer and other vaccines, complete lack of any sort of clear information or encouragement for people to get their shots...."
9769,"“I have grave concerns over the safety of the vaccine.”

OFFERED FREE STUFF

9778,"It’s kind of not our problem if someone chooses to lie, they’re endangering themselves more so than me, someone who’s fully vaccinated."
9779,"From a popularity perspective it seems to go Pfizer &gt; JJ &gt; Moderna, but JJ was late to the game and is shipping paltry amounts at a time."
9780,Towards the peak of vaccination in my county we were getting about 200 JJ and 500 Moderna a week - and over 1000 Pfizer.
9781,"That man, as far as he knew, thought the country basically had 0 covid cases, so there's probably no reason he thought it was more than a cold or something."
9782,No wonder he just went about his business even though he had covid.
9783,"I mean, still stupid, but yeah."
9784,We do this until people are vaccinated.
9785,It’s pretty simple.

9788,that's the point.

9790,It isn't.
9791,The whole idea of Darwin is that people who are best fitted for life survive and pass their genes while others (unfitted) die and don't pass their genes.
9792,There is no requirement that this superiority must be physical.
9793,It can be intelligence or just instinct too.
9794,Antivaxers not doing vaccination will weaken the probability to pass their genes.
9795,It is not only about Coronavirus.
9796,They also expose their children to other child diseases.
9797,Basically there are too ways of immunization.
9798,1. dying until a generation is immune (slow) or 2. doing vaccination (fast).
9799,Of course the second way requires every future generation to get the vaccine but this is no problem because we pass our knowledge to future generations.

9805,It will be interesting to watch Israel and other countries which are far up the vaccination curve.
9806,And it's far from semantics to point this out.
9807,"With respect to epidemiology, the term endemic has a specific meaning, and you were using it to describe that it isn't."
9808,It refers to a steady state where R0.S = 1.
9809,And currently there is no country on earth to which this applies.
9810,"If we relied on natural immunity, then covid would probably become endemic, as we would reach a steady state where the virus would circulate predominantly through young immune naive children."
9811,"With vaccines, we can drop R0.S to below 1, so the virus numbers drop."
9812,That title needs a rewrite for sure.
9813,This is the results of their investigations.
9814,When it comes to people who are about to die anyway it’s hard/impossible to say if one thing is what killed them.
9815,"The scientists saying likely is far stronger than your post makes it sound, but it will never be possible to prove what specific factors caused these people to die when they did vs a few months later."

9817,How the fuck is that guys absurd comment upvoted.
9818,wut?
9819,Our government put all its eggs in the AstraZeneca basket and then became wary of it.
9820,Anyone under 50 gets the Pfizer anyone over here AstraZeneca.
9821,They want most people to have their first shot offered by end of 2021 but about 1/3 of Australia is vaccine hesitant.
9822,LMAO.
9823,glad you moved on.
9824,we're finally breaking through the wingnuts and allowing us to have our country back.
9825,"Unless zero-Covid countries manage to get 95%+ vaccinated, then yes, locking down every time new cases pop up is unsustainable."
9826,Covid will be endemic at low levels for years or decades.
9827,Damn.
9828,I guess that is 2 million x 50 - that’s pretty insane.
9829,Everybody who has already been vaccinated is eligible for the larger prizes though.
9830,I’m not a rich person by any stretch of the imagination but losing out on $50 won’t get me too riled up.
9831,I’ll take the free shot and be on my way.
9832,Agreed.
9833,The vaccine sites in public transportation systems have been successful!
9834,Convenience is key now.
9835,"This still blows my mind.. like it's so hard for me to grasp just how many people that is, especially because I personally only know maybe 10 people who have had it, and 0 people who've died from it."
9836,Literally noone knows.
9837,The number of excess deaths in India seems to be about 20k per day.
9838,"At the very least over a million people have died from covid in india, likely it's around 3-5 million."
9839,Official numbers are severly undercounted.
9840,Excess deaths are at about 100% that of normal for few weeks in april and may
9841,Are you being sarcastic?
9842,The vaccines are free anywhere you can get the vaccines.
9843,The federal government is paying for all of the vaccines in the US.
9844,But you won't have to get the vaccine at Kroger to qualify for this promotion either.

9878,From one study (n=77).
9879,"Here's the article and abstract: https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-021-03647-4

&gt; Long-lived bone marrow plasma cells (BMPCs) are a persistent and essential source of protective antibodies1–7."
9880,Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) convalescent individuals have a significantly lower risk of reinfection8–10.
9881,"Nonetheless, it has been reported that anti-SARS-CoV-2 serum antibodies experience rapid decay in the first few months after infection, raising concerns that long-lived BMPCs may not be generated and humoral immunity against this virus may be short-lived11–13."
9882,"Here we demonstrate that in patients who experienced mild infections (n=77), serum anti-SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) antibodies decline rapidly in the first 4 months after infection and then more gradually over the following 7 months, remaining detectable at least 11 months after infection."
9883,Anti-S antibody titers correlated with the frequency of S-specific BMPCs obtained from bone marrow aspirates of 18 SARS-CoV-2 convalescent patients 7 to 8 months after infection.
9884,S-specific BMPCs were not detected in aspirates from 11 healthy subjects with no history of SARS-CoV-2 infection.
9885,"We demonstrate that S-binding BMPCs are quiescent, indicating that they are part of a long-lived compartment."
9886,"Consistently, circulating resting memory B cells directed against the S protein were detected in the convalescent individuals."
9887,"Overall, we show that SARS-CoV-2 infection induces a robust antigen-specific, long-lived humoral immune response in humans."
9888,"Yeah, it won't buy a place to live, but it can be used to invest or start a business or pay off student loans."
9889,From minimum wage to business owner or from drowning in monthly loan payments to not are both significantly life changing.

9965,FUCK YEAH!
9966,"It works well against UK and California variants, not so much against Brazilian, South African and NY variants."
9967,"I hope the efficacy drop against the P.1 variant is not as much as to invalidate vaccination against it with Coronavac, since 70% of all vaccines already applied in Brazil are Coronavac."
9968,Also problematic because they're paying off patients to get a bigger share of sweet guberment money.
9969,I hardly knew I had it so I say get after it
9970,B-cells make antibodies.
9971,But T-cells are also very important in antiviral immunity and I wish people would talk about them more.
9972,They're just harder to study.
9973,A total of 900 deaths country wide.
9974,I have not been restricted from any events.
9975,Had to hear a mask for a total of a week over the last year and all cafes/restaurants have been open year round.
9976,Local lockdowns like that allow the rest of the country to live normally.
9977,"America has been in many more lockdowns, masks outside for most of the year, around 600k dead."
9978,I know what I prefer.
9979,Not to mention about a year ago all you were claiming how good Sweden was going to do.
9980,Now they have more deaths and a lower GDP than surrounding Nordic counties so it simply is a worse solution to not lockdown.
9981,Is that frustrating to you all?
9982,Especially with no end in sight?
9983,Yes.The air itself is not safe.
9984,I can only pray until this situation is under control once again.
9985,But in india it will take months now.
9986,Hope Australia recovers though.
9987,"&gt;Or, just because you don’t currently have antibodies doesn’t mean that your **t-cells won’t immediately recognize the virus and start producing them en masse**

It's actually your B-cells, not T-cells, that produce antibodies as part of your humoral response to a previous infection/inoculation."

9998,India is in a pretty bad situation and a lot people go to Australia for study/business/work etc.
9999,I hope you guys handle the situation better than Indian politicians.
10000,It is quite sad and disheartening that carelessness is causing so many deaths.
10001,Thank you all for your kind replies.
10002,Meanwhile poor countries can't even vaccinate those who want to do it
10003,Nothing crazy just because next weekend our twins turn 1 and we are going to the zoo and having a picnic one day and having their birthday party the next!

10007,They're giving out $100 million in forms of $50 gift cards.
10008,That's 2 million $50 gift cards.
10009,So basically you're almost guaranteed to get paid $50 to get vaccinated if you waited until now to get vaccinated while everyone else doesn't.
10010,Being sensible
10011,Okay - certain to become endemic?
10012,Is that better?
10013,You and the person I was responding to know what both I and the other person meant.

10047,"They are months behind the other countries because they didn't have ""me first"" arrangements."
10048,"I am kinda supportive of that: the vaccine is a hot commodity worldwide, the Covid situation is really bad in other places, and Australia has been able to contain the virus, so why not let the other countries have first grabs?"
10049,It could have been a boon since Australia had the advantage of seeing what worked and didn't work in other countries.
10050,But unfortunately Australia dropped the ball lol.
10051,They put all of their eggs in the AstraZeneca basket.

10086,I wonder if they take in to account people who can't get the vaccine for medical reasons.
10087,I know they only have 4 of these $1000.00 tickets and this is mostly to draw attention.
10088,"Still though, I'm on the fence about this."
10089,"If we're comparing the risk caused by getting vaccinated with AstraZeneca with the risk caused by having a Covid-19 infection, then the risk caused by the infection is clearly much greater."
10090,But a proper risk assessment also has to factor in the probability of becoming infected with the Covid-19 virus in the first place.
10091,"Suppose a year from now, the prevalence of Covid-19 is so low that the average person has a one in a million chance (0.000001) of becoming infected."
10092,"Suppose that because of my age and good health, I have a one in a thousand (0.001) chance of dying from an infection."

10117,rich western countries) are way ahead in the vaccination effort.
10118,I don’t want to be overly partisan but I think the government has relied too heavily on “Fortress Australia” and I really think they should have been much more aggressive with both pursuing vaccine contracts abroad and also pushing forward with licensed domestic vaccine production (by this I mean not putting all our eggs in one basket I.e.
10119,the Queensland developed vaccine which was unsuccessful as far as I’m aware).

10592,I mean as far as vaccinations.
10593,Don’t be too alarmed.
10594,Certain employers like hospitals can require vaccination records.
10595,I should have been more specific yet again.
10596,"Technically, yeah, you're not wrong."
10597,Discrimination is allowed in an unregulated market.
10598,2 questions then.
10599,"One: are you advocating, in the context of this event, for equal ticket prices for both groups of people by governmental control?"
10600,Two: Would you attend an event of your choosing if the situation were reversed in which the event costs significantly more for vaccinated patrons vs non-vaccinated patrons?
10601,"Nah, the vaccination campaign here is still quite slow and the P1 variant appeared before it even started"
10602,[deleted]
10603,Have they not been?
10604,"And most of them were asymptomatic right - they just have to get tested all the time given their profession, otherwise we would have never even know."

Emergency Use Authorization for these vaccines only means we haven’t had enough time to know the long term EFFICACY."
10619,#IT HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH SAFETY.
10620,"&gt;It's true that the Pfizer/BioNTech, Moderna and Johnson &amp; Johnson vaccines have emergency use authorization from the FDA and not full approval yet."
10621,"But that's only because not enough time has passed to show how long the vaccines stay effective, Offit said."
10622,"&gt;""Frankly, the only real difference was in length of follow-up,"" he said."
10623,"""Typically, you like to see efficacy for a year or two years."""
10624,&gt;He stressed that the vaccines' EUA status doesn't mean they're less safe.
10625,"As a member of the FDA vaccine advisory committee, Offit said the vaccines are reviewed with the same level of scrutiny as they would to get full approval."

10631,The lag in reporting is keeping them artificially elevated for the time being.
10632,"A pretty important difference, at least for now, between COVID and the flu though is that people can and do get the flu each and every year."
10633,The flu virus is incredibly efficient at mutating just enough to escape our immune response without fundamentally changing to become a different type of pathogen.
10634,"With COVID, it’s obviously early on in its history so we can’t say for sure what will happen, but indications are that immunity produced by previous infection and vaccination are going to be much more durable, and reinfections typically rare and mild."
10635,Many of these people don’t understand how vaccines work.
10636,It’s not a medicine who will do the heavy lifting instead of your “immune system”.
10637,The vaccine teaches your system to fight off covid the easy way.
10638,The hard way is you getting covid and potentially dying.
10639,I know.
10640,How do you think pandemics ended before vaccines?
10641,"So, $38 then for all the anti vax Floridian's with fake vax cards."

10648,It's also worth noting that eluding 25-61% implies that natural immunity did give SOME protection against the P1 variant.
10649,Ok fair enough maybe an extra 8% is worth it.
10650,"Yea I get that frustration, was similar here too I think the severity over the last months has changed alot"

10654,The owner of the company I work for has always been big on people staying home when sick even before the pandemic.

10684,I guess decades of education cuts are backfiring on us lol.
10685,Just flabbergasted people can be this fucking dumb and that’s coming from someone who is not all that bright.
10686,"And yet, our idiot government has announced a ""reopening plan"" that has us effectively still in lockdown until ""around"" June 14th, and then goes through three very conservative steps that don't even culminate in a full reopening."
10687,"We need to start getting a lot more people *fully* vaccinated with both doses, especially given the poor protection against variants that a a single does provides."
10688,But what about 5G?
10689,What?
10690,Allegheny county has had declining cases for the last 6 weeks.
10691,"And they’ve been declining pretty much exactly in sync with the us trend, they just dipped more than the US overall before the slight bump that preceded this massive drop."
10692,Is there any study or publication about the effect of the vaccines in long-term sequels if you still get infected?
10693,"We're being vaccinated mostly with Sinovac over here, which prevents around 67% of symptomatic Covid and I'm a bit concerned that we can still get infected with mild symptoms, but it is known that some people with mild Covid are still battling with all kinds of sequels, including organs damage..."
10694,"I've read that vaccines do help people that lost their sense of taste/smell, so I guess that's a good sign?"
10695,Carrots and sticks!

10709,Matter of fact I hate it!
10710,But I would not run someone over if they wanted to eat it.
10711,I feel this could apply to many things.
10712,The concern right now is mixing the “bubbles” of unvaccinated people.
10713,Two different unvaccinated households should wear masks and preferably be outdoors if they’re getting together.
10714,"Vaccinated people can freely mix with vaccinated and unvaccinated people, because the risk of catching or spreading from or to a vaccinated person is negligible."
10715,"If there are no other unvaccinated people from other households or strangers of unknown vaccine status, you may both take off the masks, be indoors, hug, etc."
10716,Yeah.
10717,"I am from Serbia, 90% of population got Sinopharm vaccine."
10718,"I got covid after second shot but it was like worse cold, mild flu."
10719,Not great at preventing spread but makes covid manageable for health system.
10720,"I think it has to do with prevalence of UK variant, why it is not effective against spread."
10721,It probably works great against original covid strain but most of us who got it this year had UK variant.
10722,It all depends on the person.
10723,Some people literally know nothing about it.
10724,Some people have questions that are easily answered.
10725,Some people have reservations that are easy to address.

10769,You sound glad for your countries decision but if more support was available to you you might have a different perspective.
10770,Not really.
10771,"The vaccine is effective but people don't want it because of ""brand recognition"" or some other BS."
10772,"The goal is to get as many people vaccinated as possible, so If you're sitting on tons of JJ vaccines, might as well send them somewhere where they'll be used and lives will be saved."
10773,Easier to do that with a single dose vaccine that doesn't have extreme cold storage requirements.
10774,And I'm just saying that the Australian governement is paying their own incompetence.
10775,"They're not brave, they don't have a choice."
10776,I'm stuck wondering about the privacy aspects of a program like that.
10777,Should I expect extra junk mail now that someone submitted my name to a lottery?
10778,"Honestly, I think the hysteria last October created that mess."
10779,"The media had many people convinced that the CDC was cutting corners to support T r u m p and all of a sudden, this sub was full of people talking about longterm safety data saying they wanted to wait a year to get the shot."
10780,It's hard to unring that bell.
10781,[deleted]
10782,Couldn’t this be considered a failing of the government for not reconsidering the law and redefining who can and cannot administer a vaccine?
10783,"Yep once I learned that, I went to go get it."
10784,It’s important to circulate truth as much as possible to drown out the misinformation which is so harmful.
10785,I actually used to own one of them but wasn’t warm enough for where I live which is near Ballarat (and actually colder than there).
10786,Ended up upgrading to the highest winter rated Kathmandu jacket.
10787,The same jacket almost everyone In Ballarat seems to wear it’s basically a uniform here.
10788,"When vaccines first rolled out the line was ""there is no evidence that they reduce spread"" because they hadn't been tested for that yet."
10789,Not having proved something *(yet)* is not the same as proving it false.
10790,Are we?
10791,"And even if so, will it be as much of a concern if the majority have immunity?"
10792,I donated bone marrow to my cousin who had leukemia and it’s not a pleasant experience.
10793,"I don't know anything about our supply etc, but I always assumed the roll out plan would be to vaccinate everyone who wants to be vaccinated first, and then start incentivising the remainder."
10794,"If they made vaccination a requirement for the pension for example, over 50s would be all over it pretty quick."
10795,That would have been my guess... thank you
10796,&gt; Vaccinate the athletes before even the general population?
10797,I would consider this rather ethical given that [Japan has 10s of millions of doses and just isn't administering them rapidly](https://apnews.com/article/japan-coronavirus-vaccine-coronavirus-pandemic-sports-business-04eaae220abeff6cb30ee4f0e0fc58f8).
10798,"They insisted on additional, domestic testing before approval *and* they refuse to allow anyone other than doctors and nurses to administer the shots."

10810,"Meanwhile, in Santiago Chile we just had 8000 new cases and the government is lifting the pathetic quarantines they imposed"
10811,I wish they responded that fast everywhere.
10812,Not all of us.
10813,Some of us don't contract colds.
10814,Fellow pregnant woman here.
10815,"I also miscarried in the past, so I understand your fears."
10816,(The miscarriage was not due to covid.
10817,It was due to chromosomal abnormalities which is very common in the first trimester.)
10818,I am fully vaccinated and got the vaccine after hearing about all the complications and deaths from covid infected pregnant women.
10819,(Deaths to both the mother and child.)
10820,I also got the vaccine after hearing about the likeability that vaccinated moms give antibodies to their baby.
10821,"Considering how it will be a while before a vaccine is approved for babies, this seemed like a great option for me."
10822,It's worth noting that the sterility rumors were debunked by the ACOG.
10823,There's no scientific evidence of this.
10824,"https://www.acog.org/clinical/clinical-guidance/practice-advisory/articles/2020/12/vaccinating-pregnant-and-lactating-patients-against-covid-19

**Here's my ongoing list of what I've gathered."
10825,"Maybe it will help:**

* This website is a really good summary of everything about the covid vaccine: https://www.acog.org/clinical/clinical-guidance/practice-advisory/articles/2020/12/vaccinating-pregnant-and-lactating-patients-against-covid-19 The ACOG expects based on the mechanism of mRNA vaccines that the safety and efficacy profile for pregnant individuals would be similar to that observed in non pregnant individuals."
10826,ACOG also mentions how the covid vaccines are not live vaccines.
10827,Live vaccines are not recommended for pregnant women as those are increased risk to the baby.
10828,It's worth noting that other vaccines (like flu and tdap) are highly recommended during pregnancy.
10829,"* Studies in animals receiving moderna, pfizer, and J&amp;J vaccine before or during pregnancy found no safety concerns according to the CDC."
10830,"https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/recommendations/pregnancy.html
 
* The vsafe app is how the CDC is tracking pregnant women."
10831,"So far, they are finding no correlation with pregnancy complications of women who were vaccinated compared to the general background rates of what is typical."
10832,"30,494 pregnant women have registered on the app when this report came out: https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/acip/meetings/downloads/slides-2021-02/28-03-01/05-covid-Shimabukuro.pdf No unexpected pregnant or infant outcomes have been observed related to covid vaccination during pregnancy."
10833,"You can also see these findings summarized here as well: https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2104983

* Because of the above findings in the New England Journal of Medicine, the CDC recommends that pregnant women should get vaccinated."
10834,"https://www.wsj.com/articles/cdc-recommends-pregnant-women-receive-covid-19-vaccine-11619217983

10835,"https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/safety/vsafepregnancyregistry.html

10837,She had one shot of the vaccine.

* Here's a report of 131 reproductive-age vaccine recipients (84 pregnant, 31 lactating, and 16 non-pregnant) and they found Vaccine-generated antibodies were present in all umbilical cord blood and breastmilk samples."
10840,"These women had similar immune responses to the vaccine as nonpregnant women, suggesting that the vaccine would be just as effective for them."
10841,"https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.03.07.21253094v1

10842,"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/baby-born-covid-antibodies-moderna-vaccine/?ftag=CNM-00-10aag7e
 
* The mRNA vaccine is extremely fragile (thus it's stored in cold temperatures) and short lived."
10843,It is extremely unlikely that any mRNA will be able to get into the baby or placenta.

10846,"In this particular case study, the mother was ""moderately sick"" with covid at week 21."
10847,"Two weeks after illness, an ultrasound scan detected abnormalities in the fetus, as described in the paper: ""Specific conditions included critical blood flow in the fetal umbilical artery, fetal growth restriction (1st percentile), right ventricular hypertrophy, hydropericardium, echo-characteristics of hypoxic-ischemic brain injury (leukomalacia in periventricular area) and intraventricular hemorrhage at the 25th week of gestation."""

* A study of more than 2,100 pregnant women across 18 countries worldwide has revealed that COVID-19 is associated with a higher risk of severe maternal and newborn complications than previously recognised."
10850,"Women with COVID-19 during pregnancy were over 50% more likely to experience pregnancy complications (such as premature birth, pre-eclampsia, admission to intensive care and death) compared to pregnant women unaffected by COVID-19."
10851,"Newborns of infected women were also nearly three times more at risk of severe medical complications, such as admission to a Neonatal Intensive Care Unit – mostly due to premature birth."

* Pfizer and Moderna have been studied to be effective against the NY variant."
10853,Pfizer and Moderna vaccines are only marginally less protective against the variant that devastated Britain.
10854,"https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/22/health/covid-ny-variant-vaccine.html

* If you're interested in vaccine safety over long term periods, I found this https://www.cdc.gov/vaccinesafety/concerns/concerns-history.html pretty eye opening."
10855,Vaccines have overall been very safe with very few recalls.
10856,"It's also worth mentioning that we don't question ""long term effects"" of other vaccines."
10857,"Yes, I know about the history of thalidomide."
10858,It's worth stating though that thalidomide wasn't approved by the FDA for pregnant women in the US as well as it forced drug companies to be even stricter in regards to their clinical trials.
10859,Regulations have grown a lot since then.
10860,It's pretty well managed.
10861,I travelled to Melbourne last week (wasn't keen but it was work) and got home before this all blew up.
10862,But I still got messages updating me on the Melbourne outbreak (and eventually directing me to get tested) because you have to get a pass to travel interstate.
10863,The (temporary) restrictions on movement and other freedoms are bloody effective in keeping us safe.

10865,Tramp closed at 11am Sunday lol
10866,I just had a tenant call and said he got Covid and his work is making him take two weeks off.
10867,"I couldn't help but ask ""You didn't try and get vaccinated?"""
10868,He said no way was he putting that in his body and it's killed more people than all vaccines in twenty years.
10869,Then he went on to say his wife and newly born baby are gonna get Covid and probably end up in the hospital.
10870,He wanted to use the last month rent I collected up front.
10871,"Nope, doesn't work that way."
10872,Especially when you did this to yourself......
10873,There is an extremely long list of things experts have raised that this gov has ignored and worked against.
10874,"No 40-50 can now get it, the Pfizer."
10875,They don't.
10876,But it's either one week if spoiled foods and lost profits or months and months and months turning into the USA or Brasil
10877,Vaccinations are the public health initiative
10878,"Wow, I had no idea."
10879,That mixed with the number of army vets with PTSD pretty much makes murder legal then!
10880,?
10881,So what is the plan then?
10882,Just stay isolated from the rest of the world until a certain amount are vaccinated?
10883,Which at this pace will take 5 years.
10884,"&gt;The vaccine, developed by Johnson &amp; Johnson’s pharmaceutical arm Janssen, has been shown to be 67% effective overall at preventing moderate to severe Covid-19, with studies suggesting it also offers complete protection from admission to hospital and death."
10885,"He said: “This is a further boost to the UK’s hugely successful vaccination programme, which has already saved over 13,000 lives, and means that we now have four safe and effective vaccines approved to help protect people from this awful virus."
10886,"“As Janssen is a single-dose vaccine, it will play an important role in the months to come as we redouble our efforts to encourage everyone to get their jabs and potentially begin a booster programme later this year.”"
10887,It was always available for the already vaccinated.
10888,Did you ever bother to check the eligibility requirements?
10889,The original cases came after 100+ days of no new cases and were of unknown origin.
10890,"Victoria, of all the states had been the worst hit in the past and a repeat would be a disaster for the country as the rest of the states are open and Covid free."
10891,Easier to shut down for 7 days for 39 cases than let it spread into a major outbreak where sny lockdown would have to be longer especially when then are so close to the finish.
10892,Some other outbreaks have been controlled without lockdowns but obviously this one had gone beyond those controls.
10893,Didnt help that two people who were close contacts didnt bother getting tested when they were symptomatic for a couple of days and carried on going to work.
10894,It says a lot about the public health institutions established by previous governments
10895,[removed]
10896,That wasn’t what the person was talking about though.
10897,"They were saying that when there are unvaccinated populations that need to be locked down because covid is in it, the government is making a brave and life saving decision to make the lockdown, as a lot of governments don’t have the balls for it."
10898,Of course if people were vaccinated then lockdown would not be necessary.
10899,It would also not be necessary if China contained it when it got it.
10900,It also wouldn’t be necessary if hotel quarantine didn’t leak covid.
10901,It also wouldn’t be necessary if we had natural immunity.
10902,I can go on forever with the list of scenarios in which lockdown isn’t necessary.
10903,"But in this case, it was"
10904,Because most Ausies are brainwashed and don't want the vax..

10928,to be fair they are right next to each other

11012,"The scientists showed that low doses of an aerosolized nanobody named Pittsburgh inhalable Nanobody-21 (PiN-21) protected hamsters from the dramatic weight loss typically associated with severe SARS-CoV-2 infection and reduced the number of infectious virus particles in the animals’ nasal cavities, throats and lungs by a million-fold, compared to placebo treatment with a nanobody that doesn’t neutralize the virus."

11021,Nearly half the country is unprotected and many of those are against mask wearing and either vaccine hesitant or antivax leaning.

11051,There is no way we would have got a massive mRNA production facility up in time for this.
11052,During a pandemic.
11053,No way.
11054,"I am critical of many things this government has got wrong, not that though."
11055,They certainly should have diversified what they were ordering from overseas.
11056,That they are accountable for.
11057,"Well, it says so in the article."
11058,That video is nonsense as well.
11059,"There is to some extent some vaccine hesitancy in all places, that is unfortunately a fact."
11060,That does not mean they are chasing young/healthy people in villages who jump into rivers to avoid vaccination when in fact there is extreme shortage of vaccines.
11061,I can’t even figure out what the bot triggered on in this one.
11062,Damn
11063,There were publications from scientists about this months ago.
11064,The real reason is that the hivemind didn't want it discussed after the prevailing left-leaning portion American media establishment refused to discuss it.
11065,"I'm saying that as somebody whose views are well to the left of the American ""liberal"" media because it's exactly what happened."
11066,"BlueMAGA echo chamber rejected this theory early on in the face of plenty of circumstantial evidence, and then it was Not To Be Discussed in many places including this sub."
11067,Now we are finding out that - surprise!
11068,- there's merit to the theory.
11069,"People are mad because the mods as well as much of the American media actively suppressed discussion of something that very much needed to be discussed, based on groupthink."
11070,"It's a problem, and I'm sorry the fact that people want to discuss this additional problem now upsets you, but that's exactly what we're going to do, so deal with it."
11071,No they have no interest in the German/American one either.
11072,Lots of anti-vaxx propaganda.
11073,"Majority believes the vaccines are ""experimental"" and ""will kill you"""
11074,Why not just lift mandates now?
11075,I'm not sure I follow.
11076,The US does have a lot more cases than Australia.
11077,"Australia has 35 deaths per million people and 1,167 cases per million people."
11078,"The United States has 452.5 deaths per million people and 102,177 cases per million people."
11079,"Turns out it was the Russians who paid influencers to push antivax...

https://www.theguardian.com/media/2021/may/25/influencers-say-russia-linked-pr-agency-asked-them-to-disparage-pfizer-vaccine"
11080,How sure are you about that?
11081,But not to form a theory about it to discuss with others about.
11082,Flying to California in the morning!
11083,*shrug* fucking beats me.
11084,They’ve lowered the age down for vaccination.
11085,But that’s still square in the middle of the age bracket most likely to distrust the vaccine.
11086,"[Government of California, now brought to you by Jack in the Box and Mountain Dew."

11100,I personally wouldn’t fancy living under the constant threat of lockdown.
11101,Imagine if you happen to have your wedding this week.
11102,And there are Australians who can’t get back into the country...
11103,They only jumped in the river because some idiot told them that it wasn’t a vaccine but liquid poison.
11104,"So they were naturally scared, I would be the same, according to the article."
11105,Exactly.
11106,They could have diversified and invested in starting mRNA back then as well as AZ.
11107,Working hard for 0 cases is good government.
11108,But 0 case nations (who have a completely unprotected populations since no one has had it) who aren’t frantically working to vaccinate that population are putting their entire effort at serious risk.
11109,30*C days are becoming more common in subarctic Russia
11110,Basically.
11111,We were in hell (Covid wise) Biden came in and fixed it.
11112,Who opens a chemist next to a discount chemist?
11113,"Lol it was a top thread 

I ain’t on this trash website like that haha that would be terrible"
11114,"If it’s Moderna or Pfizer you’re referring to, you’re off on the efficacy of the first dose by about 30%."
11115,There’s a reason cases in the US have dropped dramatically.
11116,There are multiple phases to an immune response.
11117,"After a vaccination, or when a person is infected, it takes up to two weeks to start producing antibodies."
11118,That's what the blood tests detected.
11119,But the body also produces memory cells.
11120,"Eventually the body produces fewer antibodies when the threat subsides, but the memory cells last much longer - potentially a lifetime."
11121,"And if the body is infected again, the memory cells can ramp up antibody production much more quickly."
11122,So you can test negative for antibodies in your blood while still having functional immunity to the infection.
11123,I live in Melbourne.
11124,This lockdown is destroying local businesses.
11125,My friend owns a business in the CBD and they lost 86% of profit last year.
11126,"Several shops near where I live have closed, and that was with government support."
11127,This is the second lockdown the state government has issued with no financial support.
11128,"I have coworkers living pay check to pay check already, they cannot afford to just not work for a week."
11129,I know people who have gone into serious debt because they cannot afford to pay some of the cheapest rent in Melbourne.
11130,Kinda.
11131,"Not dying of Covid was the only incentive I needed, but I guess money works for other people."
11132,"I’m not really bothered by it, though."
11133,Whatever gets shots in arms so we can get done with this thing is okay with me.
11134,They don’t fuck around.
11135,The US….sadly we fucked around a lot.
11136,Melbourne is at the same latitude as San Francisco.
11137,Let's not get too excited here.
11138,[removed]
11139,Assuming a variant doesn't pop up that the vaccine is ineffective against.
11140,Feels like globally we're trying our hardest to produce one.
11141,"It's not just that though, its still pretty much impossible to get vaccinated if your under 50 and dont fit into a special category like healthcare or specific health conditions."
11142,They dint even have a date for when vaccinations will be opened up to the under 50s.
11143,"They keep talking about how uptake has been slow,  and people aren't going....but so far only a small percent of the population is actually able to get it."
11144,I did yesterday and I'm under 40.
11145,Just lined up and got the Pfizer
11146,lol
11147,"That's rough, buddy."
11148,"most of the pile of circumstantial evidence has been out for a year, it's only since the WSJ dared touch it that the BlueMAGA media outlets (which is most of them at this point) have been forced to cover something their hivemind had previously decided not to cover, IMO solely because RedMAGA started yelling about the theory early on and thus made it icky and unpalatable."
11149,You are fully vaccinated so the odds of you catching a variant that will kill you are EXTREMELY low.
11150,Wait wtf why so low
11151,[removed]
11152,You all don’t have the internet?
11153,"&gt; ""We think the possibility of having a camp setting **where everyone is fully vaccinated** will be a reality by mid- to late-summer,"" said Commander Erin Sauber-Schatz, a team lead at the CDC, in an interview with Reuters."
11154,"&gt; 
&gt; The CDC also updated **guidance for unvaccinated camp attendees** on wearing masks outdoors."
11155,"Camps should no longer require masking outdoors in most circumstances **for vaccinated or unvaccinated children**, according to the new guidance."
11156,Do words still mean things?
11157,"To be fair, humans travel the world fairly regularly."
11158,If it's limited to a animal (and even moreso if that animal doesn't fly) it would be hard to spread over a wide region.

11162,I hope so too on the college kids!
11163,And maybe some adults will be coerced to get their shots by their employers too.
11164,&gt; In Hamburg they are still only vaccinating 70+year olds.
11165,Why is this upvoted?
11166,This is clearly not true.
11167,Okay.
11168,Sure.
11169,[removed]
11170,I hope it as well!
11171,The higher the better.
11172,"Let's aim for 90+% of the total population fully vaccinated by the end of summer (22 September), haha (you can always hope)."
11173,This means everyone of the around 90% of the people that have said they want a vaccine in the polls will actually get the vaccine ASAP after being eligible including some of the around 5% that is still unsure.
11174,And then the children also have to be vaccinated later this summer.
11175,"Hopefully with the same willingness as adults (depends mostly on parents, which seems to be fine looking at adult willingness to be vaccinated)."
11176,"That would be an absolute success if that's possible, in my opinion."
11177,"Until Australia has properly vaccinated the population then yes, quarantine sounds like a good idea."
11178,Also I think a disease free country sounds like a pretty ideal place to vacation.
11179,This will play out very well in the long run.
11180,Where would you rather be right now?
11181,India?

11183,"Yeah, unfortunately, it takes a lot of planning to organize these things (buses, insurance, etc) and I feel like everyone is just really gunshy after last year."
11184,“...Does not ensure long lasting immunity” seems pretty black and white.
11185,"They were news stories, like the one of [this man in California](https://www.npr.org/2021/05/08/994967439/california-man-arrested-in-suspected-fake-covid-19-vaccine-card-operation) or [this man in Long Island](https://www.webmd.com/vaccines/covid-19-vaccine/news/20210518/pharmacy-employee-arrested-with-fake-vaccination-cards) which will ultimately cause states to move to a digital verification system (like New York’s Exelsior pass)."
11186,With doses already here and scheduled doses Ontario can get to 90% of the total population in 2-3 weeks.
11187,Then 100% of the doses coming can go to 2nd doses.
11188,I highly doubt we will hit 90% vaccination for a number of reasons.
11189,So very soon were going to see a huge shift towards 2nd doses.
11190,Even with the government timeline set out today I feel like that's on the conservative side.

11275,I want the concert to be able to deny entry.
11276,I want to decline doing business with kkk if they walk in my store.

11279,"Discrimination is a very broad and natural occurrence, for example we can discriminate customers based on who can and cannot pay prices for objects (just don’t use any prejudices to assume someone can or cannot pay tho)"
11280,I'm not saying anything beyond the fact that it's a bad example when the bakery won their case.
11281,I think a lot of people forgot about the case after it was first brought up and never actually saw the result.

11287,What they want is power and money.
11288,Not the stained mickey mouse shirt ones but the ones that set the strategy in motion.

11292,"**Lab leaks happen all the time**

It’s not just Chinese virology labs that screw up the handling of potentially planet-altering pathogens."
11293,"All over the world, virology labs have similarly overseen security breaches with the potential to infect millions."
11294,"In 2014 it emerged that labs connected to the U.S. Centres for Disease Control were guilty of, among other things, accidentally exposing a bunch of researchers to anthrax and losing vials of smallpox, the now-extinct virus that ranks as the deadliest disease in human history."
11295,Lab leaks have caused several verified disease outbreaks.
11296,"In 1977, a strange flu began surging through the Soviet Union and China."
11297,"Subsequent analysis of the virus concluded that it was exactly the same as a 1949 flu strain, raising suspicions that the outbreak had been caused by an escape from a laboratory freezer."
11298,"History’s last victim of smallpox, British woman Janet Parker, was killed by a 1978 lab screw-up at Birmingham University."
11299,There have even been two lab leaks of SARS in the months after the disease’s 2003 outbreak had been contained.
11300,"One was a student who accidentally picked up the disease in August, 2003 at a lab at the National University of Singapore."
11301,"The other was a SARS researcher who fell ill after handling biohazardous waste without gloves or a mask.In March, Robert Redfield, former director of the Centres for Disease Control, became one of the most prominent early backers of the “lab leak” theory when he told CNN that “the most likely etiology of this pathology in Wuhan was from a laboratory.”

11343,I see a lot of people on Reddit making this mistake.
11344,I once went on holiday to the US and a random woman struck up conversation with me in a shop.
11345,She noticed my accent and asked where I was from.
11346,"I told her: ""I am Dutch""."
11347,"She happily replied: ""oh!"
11348,"I love Denmark!"""
11349,I didn't have the heart to correct her.
11350,"I can see where the confusion comes from, as both adjectives sound very similar."
11351,Everything open except for international students to return.
11352,Most people are back to normal.
11353,Others are stuck in limbo while waiting for things to return
11354,4% of the population in the US
11355,Yeah definitely.

11369,Although the IOC probably should be working with Japan on getting that shit taken care of too as they have a vested interest.

11375,The rate of deaths in children in Brazil is still extremely low - you cannot argue otherwise.
11376,The post above serves to make people scared about that fact even though there's really no reason to be.
11377,Sounds right!!
11378,Some of my family live in Australia and are skeptical about the vaccine and say similar things about it that some of my family that are American that are scared of vaccines say.
11379,It’s a lot of the same stuff as well as vague fear.

11403,A majority of the U.S. has received at least on dose (50.1%).
11404,It blows me away people will pay $20 to get something that they could otherwise get for free.
11405,Vaccines are flooding into Canada.
11406,This seems like it’s the next progression.
11407,Big brain move.
11408,"You know Covid will never go away, right?"
11409,You vaccinate your populace and deal with lower numbers of cases.
11410,That’s the end game.
11411,The way you government is handling this is unacceptable to me.
11412,Ruining the livelihoods of Millions to save 34 people who have a 0.1% chance of dying.

11415,I love these ideas even thought it’s going to be horrible weather in the Northeast this weekend.
11416,Putting these mobile vaccine clinics in places where people gather is smart.
11417,It brings them to people who haven’t self-motivated to do it for whatever reason and gives an element of positive peer pressure too.
11418,Vaccine producers are also proritising countries that have more cases.
11419,It's not going.
11420,Roughly 2% fully vaccinated and 4% with some kind of shot.
11421,"Outside of front line workers, only over 60s can get a shot, and much of that was put on hold after the AZ blood clot news."
11422,"The rollout has been terrible, with supply chain grossly mismanaged."
11423,There have also been cases (a case?
11424,Don't remember) of doctors giving way too much of the vaccine per dose due to poor training.
11425,"The PM also keeps saying ""it's not a race, it's not a competition"" or some BS which lulls people into thinking they don't need to get vaccinated because there are 0 cases in their state."
11426,Goodbye.
11427,After doing my own quick lookup that sounds like what the government would say about why it is happening.
11428,Others are a lot more critical of the rollout.
11429,The idea that is them being the good guys also seems dubious at best when you have the below articles explaining other reasons.

It sounds like Australia made the mistake of relying on just one major source for vaccines and that was AZ because they have manufacturing there for it."
11431,Then here was the blood clot issues and recommendations were made that only over 50s use it.
11432,They then had to scramble to secure more doses from other manufacturers.
11433,"So unlike Canada, that very early on secured supply from almost all the major manufacturers, Australia had to pivot and then up it's order of other vaccines because of the AZ issue."
11434,And they did do that so that doesn't sound like they are being the good guy here.
11435,But now with much of the worlds production secured for the near future they have to wait.
11436,I mean it sounds like it has been a massive shit show.
11437,It looks like they relied on AZ so heavily that they didn't even bother to get contacts with Moderna and it hasn't even been approved for use by Australia.
11438,"Meanwhile in Canada AZ, Moderna, Pfizer, Janssen are all approved  and supply of all of  them was secured way before approval was done."
11439,So this sounds more like you rolled the dice on AZ only and got burned.

11461,"It is also has the fourth highest attendance per capita (behind Navajo Nation in AZ; ND; and AK), and by far the highest attendance per capita among states that aren't much, much smaller."
11462,It probably comes up once a month in casual conversation whether the fair is going to happen at all this year.

11472,This is the dumbest rule ever.
11473,I've been through covid and have also received 2 shots of the vaccine.

11479,3 days is too little to catch most cases anyways.

11650,Doesn't say anything about foreigners being allowed to enter.

11652,"The article and scientists have all said it isn't full protection, nowhere near full protection."
11653,"It just lowers the infection chance and, hopefully, dulls the symptoms."
11654,"And if covid was going away, why do you think people are talking about booster shots?"
11655,It probably won't run its course for a long time.

11657,"Unless she intends to spend a lifetime studying biochemistry she will frankly never know how it works or ""what she's putting in her body"", and the assumption that she ever will, and will be able to use that information to make a more optimal decision then just taking it now, is irrational."
11658,"She is just another person choosing to ignore all the reasons to take it now and holding out indefinitely for something, anything, to give her a reason not to take it."
11659,Can't you leave through new Zealand if you want out that badly?
11660,For women under 40 it is actually more high risk than covid.
11661,At this point I don’t care if stupid people refuse the vaccine.
11662,"Action has consequences, if they die, it’s their choice that caused it."
11663,🤷🏻‍♂️ yes I be glad to avoid them and shun them.
11664,Yeah keep this stuff up... Can't wait to see the scalping market post covid..... Idiots
11665,It’s pretty much over for vaccinated people.
11666,I’ve resumed normal life except wearing a mask at work (still required).
11667,"Those that choose to remain unvaccinated, it’s definitely not over for them."
11668,Don’t feel sorry for them either if they end up sick or in the hospital.
11669,Weather is mostly rain and 50-60F for NYC this weekend.
11670,Awful day for the beach.
11671,Who's doing that?
11672,Why make up some weird scenario that's never going to happen?
11673,"Imagine forging something that you can get for free when you get a vaccine to protect yourself and others, for free."
11674,The title isnt wrong.
11675,"It only says that you'll keep producing antibodies, not that the antibodies produced will be effective against all possible future mutations."
11676,In NYC?
11677,Probably won't get large case numbers.
11678,The weather is rain all weekend and chilly (50-60Fs).
11679,There will definitely be fewer beach goers and BBQs.
11680,I was curious about population of Maryland vs. Denmark.
11681,Maryland has more people than Denmark.
11682,Hopefully not
11683,That seems so stupid to me.
11684,"Why would they let me back into Canada where they're super strict about covid, and than go back to the US, when I could just not go back to Canada at all?"
11685,"UK just reported 4,182 cases today."
11686,"They were under 3,000 for the past several weeks."
11687,GG
11688,Me too.
11689,"Along with the anti-lockdown, anti-mask trope a while back."
11690,I will never understand how in the world we were able to so efficiently politicize a global pandemic.
11691,Humans are dumb.
11692,Thanks for this.
11693,Huh...
11694,"So if I really did catch a mild case of covid back when the Orange One apparently did, that means I might not need a shot."
11695,Still getting one.
11696,Double tap and all that.
11697,People over 50 is 34% of the population; not a small percentage.
11698,Don't ever ask me for a dime again if the Ohio state government can give away 5 million taxpayer dollars to bribe people into getting the vaccine.
11699,"An antibody test will detect circulating antibodies, but a negative test for those may not mean you *don't* still have immunity."
11700,You may want to [test for T-cells] (https://www.t-detect.com/) (longer lived than antibodies) depending on how long you suspect it's been since you had COVID.
11701,"&gt; In my case when I had Covid a second time, it kicked my butt, spent nearly 15 days in a hospital, while the first time I barely felt it

What is your age?"
11702,[deleted]
11703,"The last paragraph says 

“But the persistence of antibody production, whether elicited by vaccination or infection, does not ensure long-lasting immunity to COVID-19."
11704,"The ability of some emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants to blunt the protective effects of antibodies means that additional immunizations may be needed to restore levels, says Ellebedy."
11705,“My presumption is we will need a booster.”
11706,"Sad, awful news."
11707,We really can't handle any more setbacks at this point.
11708,They will be happy to take the money of anyone willing.

11710,Ok... Oh look a squirrel!

11714,"You know not all vaccines have the same effectiveness of the covid vaccines, right?"
11715,\&gt; Other epidemics ended without vaccines.
11716,How did I miss this the first time...lol.
11717,Have a good one dude.
11718,Probably won’t be used really in the UK except for people who we don’t expect to turn up for dose 2 like homeless people.
11719,We have enough Moderna/Pfizer for the rest of our population and we just bought 60m more Pfizer
11720,Ok so what is behind this then?
11721,Why go backwards?
11722,"Hey,
Did you (possibly) do something bad?"
11723,Well no right for you then ☺️.
11724,"Screw that, rights for all"
11725,They don’t and no one cares.
11726,"https://www.thecommunityguide.org/findings/vaccination-programs-client-or-family-incentive-rewards

Here is some initial research suggesting otherwise."
11727,It’s not binary and there are plenty of people on the fence.
11728,The chief epidemiologist in charge making a fool of himself once again.
11729,I read it was most likely due to overwhelmed hospitals not the variant behaving differently than past variants.
11730,Yeah I have my vaccine dates in my MyChart account.
11731,It’s easy to show that if needed.
11732,"No musicians should ever have to play for free, though"
11733,"His last social media post ...

11734,Just causes the scalper to vaccinate then flipping for few hundred in profit
11735,Which vaccine is only 65% effective?
11736,"What a stupid policy, people have already made up their minds about the vaccine."
11737,This is only going to benefit people that were already going to get the vaccine anyway.
11738,"This might be dumb questions, but do the vast majority of common colds I get come from rhinoviruses (assuming I get a flu shot)?"
11739,Is rhinovirus transmission also airborne?
11740,And are they just too many strains out there to create an efficacious vaccine?
11741,Because I think there’s only four coronavirus strains in circulation now.
11742,"No, I asked how *else* would they know?"
11743,I didn't know employers can require your health records.
11744,That seems fucked up to me.
11745,But you said the seller wouldn’t know
11746,"Look I know my examples are quite ridiculous but there are so many insane people out there today that could take this idea, twist the fuck out of it, and run with it."
11747,"I’m all for vaccinations, I just worry about the unforeseen doors that allowing people to require proof of vaccinations could cause."
11748,What’s next?
11749,Chick Fil A or Hobby Lobby get to require proof of baptism to keep their customers safe from evil atheists such as myself?
