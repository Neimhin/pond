336,"You need the following :

A study that analyzes at least 1000 individuals who got covid from the general population not those who were hospitalized 89 years olds with 46% of them having a previous stroke."
337,"The study should represent a population of average good health

Observed long term symptoms that cause a lower quality of life: brain fog, loss of smell

Symptoms should persist minimally 6 months with return to health left indeterminate

A reasonable amount of the studied population should show the symptoms, not just 0.10-0.25%."
338,"Those deaths stats are always interesting, but also feel so very useless to assess personal risk."
339,"In many cases, age seems to be a proxy for comorbidities, like obesity."
340,Are there other stats out there that break it up by something other than just age or sex?
341,"If the strain has been around since September, it’s already been in the US since then too."
342,It's because the vaccine doesn't work... instantly.
343,Ch*tiya.
344,You’d be surprised how many in EMS don’t care about people dying......
345,"It's funny, isn't it?"
346,The people who don't want a lockdown argue that we need to think of the common good and go out and spend money to support the economy--but they are unwilling to think of the common good by wearing masks.

355,"They will either have to give up their preparation time (common in high school), or divvy up the kids so that a few join each classroom (more common in elementary school)."
356,"I've taught in multiple schools where this happens, and it happens at my kids' school as well."
357,"Not sure if there was a change in culture or funding or what, but teachers are expected to work while sick."
358,"Of course nobody says that,  from the top it's all ""take care of yourself"" and ""have a work-life balance"" but you know that if you call off, you're really messing up someone else's day."

360,"If they have to jump through a few more hoops they'll do it, especially after no travel this year/possibly 2021"
361,I hate badly done systematic reviews.
362,This study is riddled with bad methodology and covers studies over a decade prior to covid and relies on survey responses instead of clinical data.
363,Wake me up when you find a real study worth reviewing.
364,What a colossal waste of time.
365,"Oh look, journal that require publishing fees, and not pubmed indexed."
366,A blog post might have better citations compared to this.
367,"Money is nice, but does not entirely compensate for systemic failures that lead to burnout."
368,Being able to make a positive change would be more likely to keep these people in these jobs.
369,"Reading your comment and not the study in depth, it doesn't go along with what they have said are infections periods or what I have heard from people who I know who contracted covid from another person who didn't have symptoms."
370,I’m guessing both.
371,I know more and more people giving up and going back to old life.

378,"The death toll for China is probably quite a bit higher than they have reported, but I doubt it's anywhere near the 20 million that some people have speculated because of all those cancelled cellphone plans."
379,If they got hit THAT bad the real death toll for the entire world must be much higher than 1.7 million dead because there is no way the Indian subcontinent and the Americas didn't end up with several millions of deaths each in that scenario.
380,These airlines should be fined like motherfuckers and shut down for being accessories to spreading the virus.
381,"I believe once we vaccinated the elderly and the vulnerable people, we can start loosening up the economy."
382,Because death rates will go down.
383,"The only problem is,  can the economy stay in “lock down”  until April is the question."
384,"Some businesses might require it, but then every unvaccinated person will just go to the businesses that don’t."

445,The entire way the Chinese communist system is run is based on propaganda.
446,Time to educate yourself and shut the fuck up.
447,You obviously have no idea what propaganda even is.
448,"I have  looked at the numbers everyday sense mid March, it's so obvious Russia is lying about shit big time."
449,People traveling should assume everyone else in their proximity is infected.
450,"Hmmm, I think this is possible certainly but I definitely want a link for these studies."
451,The culminated death rate on worldometer is 3%.
452,"Since many cases are under reported, I think the original estimate of 1.5% is more likely."
453,"If your talking with the retroviral, ventilators, antibody treatment and whatnot of course it is much higher."
454,The point is the flu does not create such bad outcomes that makes these treatments neccissary.
455,For example the black death still exists and infects a couple people a year in the US.
456,However because we have antibiotics the death rate is essentially zero.
457,Does that make it any less deadly than the flu?
458,I would say the extreme treatments neccissary to have a similar outcome rate as the flu should make it obvious.
459,"Couple that with the massive increase the average deaths seen in every country, and it should be obvious it's much deadlier than the flu."
460,0.1% of people in the US have DIED.
461,"With lockdowns, modern technology and sanitization."
462,So I certainly will have to contradict you here.
463,It is obvious that it is deadlier than the flu in all age groups other than children under the age of 10.

More info from a New York Times article, originally published on Dec.14 but updated Dec. 25, quote followed by link to entire article:

""There aren’t enough doses for everyone, so initially the vaccine will be rationed for those who need it most."
646,"It will take time to produce and distribute the vaccine, and then schedule two vaccinations per person, three to four weeks apart."
647,"As more vaccines get approved, things will speed up."
648,"At least 40 million doses (enough for 20 million people) should be available from Pfizer and Moderna by the end of the year, and much more will come in 2021."
649,How many doses will your state get?
650,Look up your state’s vaccine distribution plans here.

652,Don’t worry.
653,"These idiots only want to claim Sweden when they talk about socialism, not knowing that it has a capitalist economy."
654,Mask wearing doesn’t do anything.
655,They’ll try to send people to jail or kill them before admitting that they’re wrong.

660,"Yep, there was a giant party(RAGE) at the beginning of december after grade 12s matriculated, and guess what,  it was the source of another outbreak"
661,Thats the scary part.
662,It will be much worse some day.
663,11k people a year are killed by drunk driving.
664,Look at the fines and punishment for that.
665,And everyone supports it.
666,300k killed by covid.
667,And we're against punishing people who don't wear a mask?
668,Are we for saving lives or not?
669,There are no more hospital beds left in many states in the US.
670,The selfish decision of not wearing a mask is affecting other people.
671,"So let's get past what you're stuck on, which is some global police force making you wear you mask."
672,"Instead, let's pivot to being a responsible member of the community."
673,"If you don't wear a mask, then you are not a member of the community and cease to receive its benefits."
674,Don't pay taxes?
675,Then you don't get government support.
676,"I'm self employed and didn't pay into unemployment,so when I'm out of work, im on my own and this was my decision."
677,So skip global police forces and fines and simply cut them off from the herd.
678,Any government issued whatever is no longer active.
679,"No passport, driving license, insurance, health care."
680,The US has more deaths than India.
681,"As you think about how different that country is from the US, it's absolutely diabolical you'd say it's unethical to mandate masks."
682,The arrogance combined with ignorance and feelings of superiority are pathetic and this part of american history will go down as such.
683,"Fuck me the ""next few days"" for approval of the Ox/AZ vaccine in UK and India are stretching longer than some months of this year have"
684,50% is not-trivial level too.
685,"Also, I definitely saw references implying much higher levels:

https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/news-perspective/2020/12/fda-documents-show-pfizer-covid-vaccine-protects-after-1-dose

690,&gt; The greatest generation....sigh would not think very highly of the adults behaving like spoiled soft children in the middle of a national crisis.

692,"I swear the first time I saw some video entitled “man/woman has tantrum at place refusing to wear a mask”, I thought nah, that’s an exaggeration."
693,Oh boy...
694,I saw one where a grown ass man laid on the floor (ew) while some patient retail worker talked him through it.
695,I saw another where some dude’s son literally carried him out of the store while he was screaming lol.
696,Check his attic!

Nothing else has worked so far,so there were few options left at this point."

706,We can’t get tested where I am unless you have more than 2 symptoms
707,"They’re getting in planes, they’re going to work, they’re going to restaurants, going to parties.."
708,They don’t care.
709,They straight up can’t be inconvenienced enough to not do whatever the fuck they want.
710,There is a state-wide mandate to shut down businesses and wear masks in Illinois.
711,My family has not worn masks or stopped visiting businesses.
712,A mandate that restricts freedom to an impractical or extremely annoying extent will not be adhered to.
713,It’s pointless.
714,The police don’t even feel like following the rules.
715,There’s A LOT of people who love the lockdowns and want them to continue indefinitely

717,That opens a whole new can of worms for Americans How can we be sure that minority community’s will not be disproportionately targeted like we have seen in so many other aspects of the justice system.

803,"I understand you’re probably talking about only doing this temporarily for COVID, but this type of attitude has implications beyond the pandemic."
804,Why stop at COVID if “saving lives” is so important?
805,It means that a significant portion of the population (everyone lower down on the priority list) will be outright ineligible for travel for the coming year.
806,Is that confirmed?
807,"Indeed, too bad countries like South Africa will have to wait until mid-2021 to finally start getting vaccines."
808,Wealthy nations are stockpiling the vaccine in such a way that will cause our people to burn out and experience wave upon wave of reinfections before we start seeing significant vaccination availability.
809,Those people will.need a doctor's note confirming you can't - as is already a case for other diaeases requiring vaccinations for travel (yellow fever when you travel to Tanzania for example).

860,"Nothing I have read, and no experts I have listened to have said that."
861,It will most likely be with us for the rest of our lives.
862,The antibodies only last 4-6 months which mean you would need a yearly injection.
863,More likely it will become less severe once you have had it or have been vaccinated (which will reduce symptoms).
864,It’s not going away.
865,I wish people would realize that.
866,I’m so tired of this whole thing and I know I’m not alone.
867,And it seems like this is going to be going on for a lot longer than people want to admit.
868,I’m not sure I’m ready to accept that we’ll probably have to live locked down throughout 2021. :(

990,some people just do not seroconvert and produce antibodies.
991,"It sucks, but you would be one of the people that need protection from herd immunity."
992,"Prohibition, and apartheid didn’t work either."
993,This sets a bad precedent and should not be followed by other countries.
994,You need to do some introspection.
995,How about a yellow star that we can wear on our sleeves?
996,[removed]
997,If they really want to punish him they will make him fly on JetBlue only.
998,"Funny enough same in my country, which happens to be South Africa"
999,"The ""western description of China"" definitely includes those things, you've just got a massive chip on your shoulder."
1000,"I've never read an article about China that says its not safe to walk at night, or that high speed rail doesn't exist."
1001,In fact I have read many articles in Western media to the contrary.
1002,"However, they also report on things that happen below the surface, to people at the fringes of society, who dissent against the government, but you find it hard to accept that those things happen."
1003,I feel sorry for you.
1004,"FYI, I never said those things in the last paragraph?"
1005,"I also have asked Chinese people what I can do to help, its just those people were my friends in HK where I live now, who are fighting against your shitty tyrannical government!"
1006,For generally healthy people it's said to be about 0.6% mortality rate overall.
1007,You seem like a knowledgable person on the subject.
1008,I have one more question: What’s the risk of this chimpanzee adenovirus in AZ’s vaccine to mutate and infect humans?
1009,I'm not surprised.
1010,"I had a friend from Eastern Europe who would act totally ridiculous in front of the police (and ultimately went to prison, lol) and we basically had to tell him that in the US, you can't just give cops a few dollars to leave you alone."
1011,"It's dark if you are an obese, unhealthy American of which there are an enormous amount."
1012,If you take care of yourself you will be just fine in 99.99% of cases.
1013,&gt;I don't think Lil Pump will enjoy breathing from a pump if he gets COVID.

1015,](https://twitter.com/andrewbostom/status/1308496346454913026)
1016,Quite a good article.
1017,Accurate data helps us know where future shipments are needed the most and helps us make sure the vaccine doses being distributed are actually being administered and not going to waste.
1018,It also helps us know how many second doses will be required in a few weeks’ time.
1019,The reporting to the public isn’t really the interesting part... it’s that the number we are seeing reflects the data the federal government is also seeing.
1020,"If the public number is wildly wrong, chances are the federal government’s internal data is also wildly wrong, which is the concerning bit."
1021,must have been A and/or B then - this was like 25 years ago...
1022,yeah wtf is up with these people?
1023,?
1024,"This is the largest, fastest vaccine rollout in history."
1025,What are you smoking?
1026,"yeah exactly, Non Mask Wearers should get locked up!"
1027,Happened last time its quite simple .
1028,"Pineapple , yeast , sugar and water leave for 2 weeks out of sunlight"
1029,So far is just in order to track reasons given by people so the goverment can act and learn how to inform ans improve communication about vaccionation.
1030,All in all people here are generally positive about it.
1031,can you freeze a disease in permafrost?
1032,I had a nasty response to the flu vaccine including vomiting chills and more.
1033,The covid shot was painless and the only side effect I’ve had is a sore arm :)
1034,I am sorry you have a problem understanding basic economics.
1035,"If people in an area are not buying caviar, then a cavier shop isn't going to do very well there."
1036,The causality is that there are few grocery stores because peoples preferences don't make it economically viable to operate.
1037,"From your post: 

""America has this problem with 'food deserts'."
1038,"When you don't have access to fresh food and eat mostly processed crap, you're very likely to bulk up yourself."""
1039,You said it was a problem of access.
1040,The article I linked proves that it's consumer preferences driving this phenomena.
1041,You seem to be too dull to understand the distinction.
1042,it never is for Libertarian scum
1043,Thank you for that explanation.
1044,What country are you in?
1045,"In 6 months time the vaccine will be protecting the vulnerable at risk of dying, and hopefully we can open up again."
1046,In the article they point out that they don't think these are the X mass ones yet.
1047,They expect an 8-10 day lag.
1048,So this is still pre Christmas.
1049,Some people would applaud if people who do not wear masks would be shot on sight.
1050,I personally wear it and support measures to prevent spreading but some governments go too far.
1051,[removed]
1052,Doesnt matter
1053,"I hate everything you said, your so full of shit."
1054,Do you just hate people?
1055,Do you want them to die?
1056,"Your country will keep being like this with people like you alive, America truerly is fucked."
1057,Nope.
1058,"That's not what I did 

I asked if you took the flu vaccine?"
1059,"Because it's freely available,and if you didn't take it then you should immediately be removed from your employment because you unessecarily put people's lives at risk"
1060,Tell me why I shouldn't just end it in advance if I catch this thing.
1061,motherfuckers like you deserve to die of covid
1062,I’ve never wanted to “be better than South Africa” but here we are.
1063,It should be like this worldwide.
1064,I don't know.
1065,That figure was given during a Biontech press conference.
1066,"This is not a rebuttal, gtfo"
1067,"&gt;(unless you have allergy or something that you can't take the vaccine)

What if you have a disease that's not well understood, such as chronic fatigue syndrome, and you honestly believe the vaccine will put you at significant risk of harm (by inflaming autoimmune problems, for example) but your doctor says ""no, it's all in your head""?"
1068,"Even if you would actually be fine, is it ok for a doctor to say, based on a 5 minute consultation, that they know better than you, who might have 20 years experience living in your body and knowing how it responds to stressors, that you are not actually at risk?"
1069,There are many examples in the literature of medical science being wrong about the risk of an intervention or about the cause of a disease.
1070,"While there is even a *chance* that something could go wrong, it seems very unethical to coerce people into an invasive intervention that has a non-zero probability of causing a serious medical problem."
1071,"In lots of rural areas the houses dont have the infrastructure for strong internet, if at all."
1072,"I know many people in my area that have to rely on their phone data, which is also always spotty and expensive."
1073,"I think in the US, the factor to multiply infections by is between 3 to 5."
1074,It's quite possible that the Russian vaccine is safe.
1075,Russia has good scientists.
1076,The problem is government transparency.
1077,"There are 2 vaccines approved, and more expected."
1078,"We won't be locked down, when most people are vaccinated"
1079,Most wore masks in those prostets but even then our voice needs to be heard
1080,Tom told them they done goofed.
1081,Not that I know of besides the change in number of serious condition cases reported.
1082,[removed]
1083,"get fucked Libertarian, the US will lose millions before this is over BECAUSE OF YOU"
1084,"Italy and Slovenia were hit *hard* at the beginning of the pandemic, when testing and treatment were both far behind."
1085,"On the other hand, some of these other countries are getting most of their deaths from the last few months and are getting worse and worse"
1086,Cmon man fucking stay in DC if you’re gonna pull crap like that
1087,"If that was what was happening in America, people would be quick to accuse the government of prioritizing the economy over lives - the reason being that 45 year olds are still productive but also likely to get adversely affected by COVID."
1088,Younger than 45 are likely to not be taken out of the game if they get sick and older than 45 are likely not contributing as much to the economy so them getting sick doesn't really matter.
1089,[removed]
1090,"Lotsa small fascist wannabes here, I see."
1091,Here in Finland we don't punish people for exercising their freedoms.
1092,"I live in an area with least restrictions and situation is very good, Coronawise.."
1093,James Earl Jones' Vader.
1094,stfu
1095,Gotta give it to the Republicans.
1096,They've successfully convinced nearly half the country that the party that's totally focused on worker's rights is the elite party.
1097,No other conservative party has managed that nonsense.

1111,That was a technological breakthrough.
1112,"Experts say it’s not unusual for a vaccine to show different efficacy rates in various settings, as trial protocols, data size and population could impact results, but the way CoronaVac data has been released created some confusion."
1113,....
1114,"Some confusion, not a big deal."

1148,"However, a few important rabbis and other Haredi public figures got it and encouraged their communities to get it"
1149,Why would it be satire?
1150,That's what happens if you instantly cut off an alcohol (or Benzodiazepine) addict.

1233,&gt; Civilization as we know it in the western world would collapse without ~~the trains running.~~ workers operating the trains.

1235,You shouldn't be travelling until you get vaccinated anyways.
1236,So that's a good thing.
1237,"as mentioned in the article, it is just ~4% antibody positive in Wuhan."
1238,"Comparing with NYC antibody test conducted in April shown 21.7% positive, I would say they have done petty well even in their most hard hit city"

&gt;     Anyone without a serious science background should play no role in policy related to a pandemic."
1260,No.
1261,We do not live in a science-ocracy.
1262,This is akin to saying that no one without a serious military background should play a role in policy during a war.
1263,All policy-makers must ultimately be controlled by a civilian authority that represents the will of the people.
1264,&gt; If you care about lives and business your best bet is to do one big serious lockdown and not lift it until there are no cases.
1265,If all countries took this approach we would've been done with this many months ago.
1266,Not if your business depends on operating year-round.
1267,There are businesses for which a four-week shutdown is tantamount to a forced permanent closure.
1268,&gt; During a pandemic setup field hospitals in all areas and only allow one regular hospital in an area to accept pandemic patients.
1269,You cannot kill off people with other conditions because suddenly there is a pandemic.
1270,"Yes, but that's easier said than done."
1271,"In general, our treatment capacity needs to be greatly increased but made scalable."
1272,We need tests and treatments--for many ailments--that can be handled by minimally-trained workers so that doctors and nurses can be freed up for more complex tasks.
1273,But to do that you have to break the guild system.
1274,&gt; Mask use should be enforced from day one seriously.
1275,People caught not wearing a mask should be escorted out of any public place immediately.
1276,Even if masks reduce the spread by 5% (and we know its much higher or every medical professional would have gotten covid and other diseases by now) it is enough to enforce it.
1277,"That's fine, but when is ""day one""?"
1278,How do you know the difference between something like Covid-19 and something like SARS that just goes away naturally.
1279,"And if you demand masks for every possible pandemic...well, there's a lesson to be learned from the boy who cried wolf."
1280,&gt; Reduce mental stress by unleashing every possible economic package to help people and businesses.
1281,As funded by whom?
1282,Economic packages don't just fall from the sky.
1283,&gt; Countries need to stockpile PPE for medical professionals and regular masks for citizens.
1284,Countries should have factories ready to go live should a pandemic hit.
1285,The same is for other possible items like ventilators and other devices that might be needed.
1286,"OK, but what do those factories do when there isn't a pandemic?"
1287,Stand idle?
1288,I’m sure they will once the UK approves it.
1289,We’ve seen it with Biontechs vaccine.
1290,"Here in Germany the public didn’t really care about the timeline at all but when the UK and the US approved it, they suddenly started paying attention"
1291,Toxic individualism is a serious issue affecting all of us.
1292,"Thing is, what you just described is still WAY easier to deal with than COVID."
1293,That's rather depressing.
1294,"No, but I think you're going about it the wrong way and seem to stubborn to realize you are."
1295,"Honestly I don't know why, either it's arrogance or just regular incompetence."

1298,"Because they didn't send the data yet to the EMA, while they did send it to the MHRA."

1350,"&gt;Wall Street’s main indexes ended at all-time highs on Monday, with pandemic-battered stocks leading the gains after U.S. President Donald Trump signed a long-awaited $2.3 trillion fiscal bill, restoring unemployment benefits to millions of Americans and averting a federal government shutdown."
1351,"Trading volumes is expected to remain light in a historically strong final week for equities, with worries over mutating coronavirus strain and upcoming U.S. Senate runoffs in Georgia posing as short-term concerns."

1359,It contravenes human nature.
1360,"If we were so easily able to discard our 2019 habits i would suggest you  look at photos from 1920 for when people got past the spanish flu: discarded masks,  gatsby style balls"
1361,you can't prove that either
1362,I scheduled my second Pfizer shot on a Friday for this very reason!
1363,First one was mostly just a sore arm.
1364,But the second shot is a little more rough we are all told.
1365,Implying he ever was rolling in money.
1366,Our only hope is now that the media puts pressure on the politicians and their failing “dying for European solidarity” strategy.

1374,"Um, no."
1375,"Public healthcare, whilst it has ways to go has stepped up significantly."

1378,In South Africa the clinics as well offer places to stay if you're positive but can't safely isolate.
1379,"Where you are given a bed and food and medication if needed for your time in isolation all at the Grand cost of R0 ($0, £0 whatever currency) it's just free."
1380,&gt; Well that last fact is not really true.
1381,"/u/LeNoirDarling's statement  ""South Africans drink a lot more than other countries by volume."""

1385,"Ughhh yeah even if the intention is pure, dont go door to door in a pandemic"
1386,"In many places (I think it varies by state), unemployment only lasts for a certain amount of time under normal circumstances (like 26 weeks, or a dollar amount based on your previous income, whichever you hit first and then you get nothing more)."
1387,"The amount that you get is often a joke, it isn't unusual for people to only get $300/week or $1200 a month total (and it's not uncommon for people to get far lower than this, it is once again based on how much you made before you lost your job)."
1388,"Covid bills helped unemployment by not only boosting the amount by $600/week, but they also extended the duration for which you could be on it."
1389,I believe those ran out in like...August?
1390,I'm not sure if it's still going on now.
1391,A HUGE problem for a lot of people is that they were unable to get through and get into the unemployment system in the first place.
1392,"Unemployment is handled at the state level, and many states have set up a system that makes it so difficult that it keeps people from getting the aid they need and this is by design."
1393,"So many people haven't gotten anything at all, yes."
1394,The US is a dumpster fire.
1395,Divorce
1396,A big percentage.
1397,I'm guessing another big percentage is that due to social distancing there's nobody there to administer the narcan.
1398,The nursing home where I work is scheduled for next week.
1399,Walgreens is coming in from 9-5 and vaccinating as many residents and staff as they physically can.
1400,We already have consents for 80+% of the residents and expect all of them to get vaccinated.
1401,About 2/3rds of our staff want the vaccine and 1/2 of those people will get the vaccine next week and then Walgreens will come back in another week and finish whoever they didn’t do.
1402,They also already have scheduled dates for the second shot visits.
1403,It’s been super interesting to learn about the process and really exciting honestly.

1434,He was probably the superspreader at that event
1435,This is a failure of absolutely massive proportions.

1592,"Some regulatory bodies in other countries will expect to see an approval from one of the ""big agencies"" first."
1593,Virus are so different that RO and mortality is not really the total sum of things.
1594,"The virus could be infectious and not show symptoms for months and still have a high RO and mortality rate, It could not be lethal so much as the survivors have a very high chance of long term chronic issues afterward."
1595,Virus RO can go up to like 18  so there is a lot of room for viruses to be more infectious than COVID.
1596,If you had a decent incubation time you could still have a high mortality with a high RO and people would not be able to stop it other than complete lockdowns where basic living needs cannot be met for all citizens because there is no safe way to operate the economy at anywhere near that volume.
1597,"Hospitals would be completely overwhelmed, people would be in mass panic and that would just be the first month or two."
1598,"Covid is like annoying pandemic, not an apocalyptic pandemic, but viruses are still more than capable of pumping out apocalyptic pandemics and modern science can't really keep up in many cases."

1611,"but as a side point, let's say i go to a doctor and he tells me ""you need to lose 80 pounds or you're more likely to die of a heart attack"" that might get me to change my diet and exercise or it might not, but if he says ""you need to lose 20 pounds or you're more likely to die of a heart attack"" that would be equally true but i'm more likely to do it."
1612,others (think NFL players) are different.
1613,"if a doctor says ""the normal recovery time for this injury is six months, so you shouldn't even be walking on week 3"" i can guarantee that every NFL player will be walking by week 3. compare that to if a doctor said ""you need to be walking by week 3 to avoid blood clots"" or whatever."
1614,they respond to the challenge of one rather than the risk of the other.
1615,saying something that 300 million americans hear is different since we all react differently.
1616,the doctor's job is to give us the strongest medicine we are willing to take.

Nah, this should be going better."
1623,That’s a canned liability statement.
1624,"Vitamin C might not be for everyone, talk to your doctor."
1625,Obviously my “effectively zero” comment is exaggerated.
1626,"When talking about 330,000,000 people, if even 10,000 can’t get it, that’s essentially zero, 0.003%."
1627,"I’m not saying they don’t matter, but with 60% of people vaccinated, and then who knows how many people previously infected, the herd immunity should be a real possibility."
1628,"Remember, there’s a pretty huge crossover between that 40% and the people who don’t wear masks or follow any restrictions."
1629,They’re just giving themselves the vaccine that comes with a fever and loss of taste/smell.
1630,I think you need to get your background story straight...given that you regularly post about your gaming PC that costs thousands of dollars and custom modded vintage consoles.
1631,This.
1632,This needs to be the outlook not the “but he lied” garbage.
1633,&gt;Or that we currently have thousands of variants floating about with an almost equal chance of catching any of then?
1634,This is the most likely.
1635,Small changes in the RNA occur all the time.
1636,All these variants are still very similar.
1637,The original strain may still be around.
1638,"In the spring, they said NY was infected with the strain they found in Italy."
1639,Just because there is a new variant doesn't mean the vaccine or natural immunity would no longer work.
1640,"Australian case is located in a quarantine hotel though, not a community case."
1641,So let's open the prisons and let them out so they can infect more people?
1642,Where's the logic in that?
1643,"Oh wait I forgot its California, they don't use logic"
1644,That's an oversimplification
1645,"Here is a table of the total number of cases reported each of the last eight Tuesdays:

    Report Date	Total Cases	Change
    ---------------------------------------
    Nov-10		162,240	
    Nov-17		192,439		+30,199
    Nov-24		225,560		+33,121
    Dec-01		260,758		+35,198
    Dec-08		297,732		+36,974
    Dec-15		341,029		+43,297
    Dec-22		389,439		+48,410
    Dec-29		428,533		+39,094

The number of new cases per week has been growing steadily until the most recent week, which I suspect has more to do with a reduction in the number of tests than a reduction in the rate of spread."
1646,The total number of confirmed cases has more than doubled in the last six weeks.
1647,No wonder the government is now trying to find way to introduce the kind of restrictions they have been resisting for so long.
1648,There are about 1.5 million people in nursing homes in the US and 10-15 million health care workers (depending on how you define it).
1649,"The nursing homes should be relatively easy, and then the health care workers who are in hospitals should also be easy."
1650,"From there it starts to get pretty tricky considering the ""cold chain""."
1651,"For those who have been vaccinated, what are some secondary effects?"
1652,RemindMe!
1653,120 days “are we still wearing masks?”
1654,I find it funny you get down voted.
1655,"SoCal out of hospitals beds, 30k cases a day, gift shops in hospitals are now used for patients."
1656,Meanwhile at Florida's worst they were never even close to out of beds.
1657,This sub = Florida bad... California good.
1658,And I doubt they are frequent international flyers.
1659,[removed]
1660,How shocking😂.
1661,We talk about china here.
1662,"I am a bit of a contrarian on that, maybe because I am 50 and have memories of the old days when we have real phones and all."
1663,"Yes, I have a landline and yes I answer it and listen."
1664,We receive calls from the mayor and from the school district and the county executive.
1665,I think that is how they stay in contact with the elderly like myself.
1666,The ones that annoy me are the police benevolent society (the very masculine sounding voice asking if I will help the police) and the people who are so very concerned about my car warranty.
1667,"Note I do support the local police, just that I don't give my giving plans based on phone calls."
1668,We will if 50% of the unvaccinated obtain natural immunity.
1669,We can get rid of masks and restrictions when the hospitalization and death rate is similar to seasonal influenza.
1670,This will happen far before “herd immunity.”
1671,"It’s nice to see that the people that actively helped spread misinformation during the pandemic, were the first to receive both special medical treatments and access to the vaccine."
1672,America is truly the greatest democracy in the world!
1673,/s
1674,Look!
1675,"It’s someone who’s never even been to a developing country, much less a 3rd world country!"
1676,When are everyday people / retail works set to get theirs?
1677,[removed]
1678,Wuhan was a shitshow.
1679,Seriously.
1680,"It was a disaster, with much of the information smoothed over and covered up by the Chinese government."
1681,Parties and pandemics don't mix.
1682,Who knew?
1683,"The Great Mortality: An Intimate History of the Black Death, the Most Devastating Plague of All Time, by John Kelly."
1684,It intersperses history about what's going on in that approximate time period with how the Black Death spread and affected cities and regions.
1685,I borrowed it as an ebook from my library.
1686,That's only looking at the data of the last few days.
1687,If you look at the comparison over the entire period it shows Sweden's response looks disastrous compared to other countries in the region.
1688,I think this is a reasonable take and i do hope it becomes much more socially acceptable to wear a mask post pandemic then it was before this year.
1689,I regularly visit some older relatives and i don't think it would be a bad idea for me to wear a mask during flu season going forward.
1690,"To me, wearing a mask all the time sucks but if it's a once and a while thing i don't mind at all."
1691,"Yeah, like everybody has been saying the entire time, and as we have seen from America, Japan and other countries who sided with optics rather than honesty."
1692,Viruses that jump species are usually a dead ends.
1693,The 'bird flu' strain everyone has been concerned about cannot spread person to person (yet).
1694,There are plenty of coronaviruses that can't infect humans.
1695,That was the SARS virus.
1696,COVID is a variation of that.
1697,That means in 7 days we'll have the first fully vaccinated person right (outside of trials)?
1698,Man that's such a glimmer of light.
1699,I hope the vaccinations are also exponential.
1700,"The governor of Buenos Aires took the vaccine today, and some people are saying it is a fake picture."
1701,"During the pandemic I realized how ridiculously biased some people are, to one side or another, and are completely close minded."
1702,"It is sad, really."
1703,"https://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/covid-vaccine-tracker-global-distribution/

I concede the lag in reporting but according to this tracker, about 13% of shots delivered over the past two weeks have been administered."
1704,I doubt much was accomplished over the holiday and weekend following so the numbers are not likely to be far off.
1705,There are probably places you can go to find high concentrations of people to be vaccinated in a single building such as hospitals and nursing homes.
1706,This seems like the easiest starting point.
1707,"It should have been possible to tally these months ago and then figure out proximity to the ""cold chain"" etc."
1708,"But then you're quickly dealing with the general public and getting people to show up at a location twice, 3 weeks apart, in proximity to the ""cold chain""."
1709,That sounds virtually impossible.
1710,Easiest starting point would be densely populated areas like cities but imagine doing this in small town USA where a lot of seniors don't have reliable access to transportation.
1711,"I spoke with my 91-year old grandmother who lives in FL over the weekend and asked her if she had been vaccinated yet, or had heard anything... she said ""no the state is botching the response and it's very confused."""
1712,"I told her DeSantis' nickname was DeathSentence, and she chuckled."
1713,I meant the design.
1714,What?
1715,Since when?
1716,"Honestly, I didn’t think we’d even *see* a vaccine in 2020."
1717,If we get even 10 million vaxxed by the end of the year then my expectations will have been wildly exceeded.
1718,The majority of 1a staff who wanted a vaccine at my hospital were able to get it- and our second batch is being rolled out next week.
1719,I’m very grateful for all the efforts put into this vaccine and hope we can get it rolled out to everyone soon.
1720,Could you explain more please?
1721,Why would you have to have a vaccine from 2 different manufacturers because you’re in the trial?
1722,"""I survived covid and all I got was complications and this t shirt."""
1723,Just curious.
1724,Is the garb the person giving the injection standard in the UK healthcare system?
1725,Looks neat.
1726,Bless this wonderful soul.
1727,Can we make Margaret our mascot?
1728,"they said there would be 20 million, but i guess that has been changed since the current count is closer to 3 million"
1729,I find is funny you get down voted.
1730,SoCal hospitals beds are at capacity.
1731,30k cases a day.
1732,While Florida never even got close to running out of beds even at its worst.
1733,If California was a country they are number 7 in the world for cases.
1734,But hey let's talk about 8k cases in Florida.
1735,West Virginia is a red leaning state.
1736,The Republican party has consistently downplayed the virus and things like mask mandates.
1737,"So yes, it would be reasonable to think the populace doesn't care."
1738,Better luck next time.
1739,"Well, bets were on Trump, guess he was the first one 😉"
1740,It's not the planes spreading it thanks to strict mask usage and their air filtration systems.
1741,It's people who either get COVID before the flight or after it spreading it in their new destinations.
1742,Here's your source about the planes: [https://www.npr.org/sections/goatsandsoda/2020/10/20/925892185/do-masks-really-cut-your-risk-of-catching-covid-19-on-long-plane-flights](https://www.npr.org/sections/goatsandsoda/2020/10/20/925892185/do-masks-really-cut-your-risk-of-catching-covid-19-on-long-plane-flights)
1743,If only they were this serious about rape
1744,What kills me is that there's *no reason* to have lags in that kind of data reporting.
1745,Real time reporting has been here for two decades now.
1746,"My office builds real time reporting for stuff like the USDA and does a data pump on a nightly job using an API into a data repository at server that scrapes the data first thing in the morning, so the results are less than 8 hours old the next day from a dozen labs around the country."
1747,"i don't go out much, but i've noticed that when i do cough or sneeze i feel better that i'm wearing a mask than covering with my hand or something"
1748,I'm not taking the vaccine because it is mandatory.
1749,I will stand agains't forms of authoritarianism like this.
1750,If the vaccine wasn't mandatory I would take it.
1751,"And yes, not being able to work, use public transport fly on a plane or go to store because you don't have the vaccine is the same as mandatory."
1752,The point is that the vast amount of sensible humans are fatigued to the point that they’re completely out of fucks to give - myself included.
1753,"Stupid humans are gonna play stupid games and win stupid prizes, and there’s unfortunately nothing their less stupid brethren can realistically do to stop them."
1754,"I'm not sure what effectively zero means, but there are people who the CDC recommend should not receive the vaccine."
1755,"[https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/safety/allergic-reaction.html](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/safety/allergic-reaction.html)

Mayo clinic says:

"" COVID-19 vaccination might  not be recommended for people with certain health conditions."
1756,"Talk to  your doctor if you have questions about getting the vaccine."""
1757,Lmao could you imagine trump even completing a coherent sentence that isn't praising himself?
1758,[removed]
1759,"I work in a public health job (not a medical professional) 

I never liked the way they talked about the roll out."
1760,"If you want medical staff vaccinated first, don’t worry."
1761,They will vaccinate each other as soon as they get the doses in the hospitals and clinics.
1762,"Of course, none of us have ever had to deal with something this large before."
1763,If only we had a national pandemic response team who were experts in this sort of stuff...
1764,&gt;actually.
1765,"The media seems to enjoy the drama of them

Yep, they're the culprits here."
1766,There's been several strains all over this last year and every year there's a new strain of the flu and the world is still spinning.
1767,There's nothing we should worry about right now.
1768,"The same podcast said that UK and USA were two of the few countries looking for new strains/mutations, so it's not strange to discover a new strain on the UK."
1769,"&gt;“If Bob changes his coat, he looks different, but he’s still Bob.”

That's a good analogy."
1770,I'm stealing that.
1771,probably because of your edit
1772,"$500 per day, so for 10 days, that's 5000."
1773,"No travel form, in violation for 10 days."
1774,Used to be 14.
1775,"Still probably very doable for him, but it should be about sending a message, so a nice public broadcast would do."
1776,warped expectations of speed
1777,Those 1000 deaths werent new deaths.
1778,They were a backlog from the first wave.
1779,Simple as that.
1780,100 comments this fast?
1781,i wonder what happened overnight
1782,"Well, the question is:

What does the vaccine immunize you for, if we havent even isolated this weird virus from China?"
1783,"I would like to see evaluated data from an independent, scientific institution regarding the essence of these vaccines."
1784,"Until now, every eldery person (+60yrs) who I know who allegedly has had it, was fine within hours or days at max."
1785,The restrictions‘ purpose is NOT to keep you healthy.
1786,"The PCR tests generate so many false positives, it‘s almost impossible and requires way more time to find covid strains, WHY EVEN TEST THEN?"
1787,The tests are not meant for this job and this was known before november 2019.
1788,I would not be surprised the figures are underestimated considering the chaos of an initial outbreak of an unknown deadly patogen.
1789,They had prior experience of SARS so the gut reaction of immediate lockdowns and draconian curfews for millions of people and severing transport links out of cities where cases occurred probably saved them from the same calamity that is now being faced in other countries.
1790,I’m all for any person or any race having as much power as they deserve.
1791,BLM isn’t though.
1792,They have no interest in uplifting the black community.
1793,"He’s 78 years old, that age group has a 15-20% mortality rate if they catch it."
1794,He’s already at the front of the line.
1795,Get out.
1796,You can only help people so much.
1797,Small towns are cults now.
1798,Yet.
1799,They will be eventually and clinical trials are ongoing.
1800,Never going to squash it like smallpox.
1801,"Smallpox had no other host reservoir; Covid has mink, bats, etc."
1802,"We had near universal vaccination around the globe for smallpox, I don't see us accomplishing that for Covid."
1803,im living in the czech republic where like 50% ppl are extremely anti - covid vaccine (almost everyone i know is against it - either it is a big global conspiracy or the vaccine is not safe etc etc.
1804,"all mostly young people 23 - 43 years old with the ones under 35 being the most vocal and radical from my circle...

now how to talk to these people?"
1805,can anyone suggest what facts can I show them to at least try to change their opinion?
1806,the more links or personal views you got the better.
1807,thanks
1808,"Yes, but they have not submitted a full data package to EMA."
1809,"They have only provided that package to the MRHA, which was already receiving the AZ vaccine as part of a rolling review (as has EMA been doing since 1 October)"
1810,I’m saying sitting in fear won’t.
1811,"Are you saying that the strain from a year ago no longer  exists,  and has 'evolved out' already?"
1812,Or that we currently have thousands of variants floating about with an almost equal chance of any of then?
1813,I've been on a couple different rural areas in Kansas during this pandemic and every small town was the same.
1814,"There weren't too many that outright thought the whole thing was a hoax, but the vast majority thought it wasn't any worse than a flu."
1815,"I had an old farmer tell me, 'we breathe worse things in the air every day on the farm so it's no big deal for us'."
1816,Then a couple months ago the pandemic finally reached some of these small towns.
1817,"Back home where my parents live they had to shut down the school for a couple weeks and parents were losing their shit, saying the teachers and doctors were overreacting, and what was the point of all the precautions the school had been taking if we were going to have to close down anyway."
1818,"People around here are fucking morons, and nobody seems to think for themselves, they're literally brainwashed by their own social media bubbles."
1819,"It's sad because normally the 'small town values *are* on great display in our small communities, but for whatever reason  (re: our president) they didn't give a fuck about this pandemic and would fill their heads with misinformation to make themselves feel better."
1820,"In my parents hometown of like 300 people, around 40 ended up getting Covid, and now I'd say 75% or so are taking it more seriously."
1821,"But by this point it's already been spread through the whole county, when most cases could've been prevented by listening to the doctors instead of 'news' hosts and social media."
1822,Who has been truthful?
1823,Please enlighten us.
1824,"Obviously China has not been, but you don't want the downvotes."
1825,I get it.
1826,This is probably a low estimate as not all states are up to date with their reporting.
1827,Are you sure?
1828,Because you seem to think masks are useless and your freedom is in jeopardy.
1829,Can I ask where you get your news?
1830,"https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-02801-8

Again...Its not even debatable at this point whether or not masks reduce transmission."
1831,"If you want to quibble about the exact percentage, or this mask over that one, fine...But every study, all of them, report transmission reduction."
1832,"If you want to cherry pick a handful of studies that don't have the exact data that you're looking for (ie: a trial of two sets of people, one with a mask and one without, in the same area, doing the same things)...and then represent that as data suggesting masks don't work, or to make a point about ""Oh we don't have rEaL dAtA""...I think this is either willfully dishonest or tragically ignorant."
1833,Exactly.
1834,What seemed to be relatively safe a few months ago may need to be rethought entirely now.
1835,Let’s not forget the people that his family possibly infected...like you or me.
1836,It's quite possible that the vaccine confers longer lasting immunity than actually having the disease.
1837,"I’ll wear them if I am feeling sick to the point of coughing and sneezing, but besides that I’m done with them after this spring."
1838,Police state
1839,Then why are immunocompromised people one of the early groups to get vaccinated?
1840,Because you're the picture of intellectualism.
1841,*rolls eyes*
1842,"No, boo, we said Operation Harp Speed."
1843,Ralaaax
1844,You received a recorded call?
1845,Can you expand on that?
1846,"I automatically hang up on recorded calls, assuming they are phishing/scam calls."
1847,In my experience anyone who has legitimate business will call live.
1848,fair enough.
1849,"I'm not an expert on type 2, but I do know there are ""levels"" to it where some have to take medicine and some don't."
1850,I would wager the (type 2) deaths would come from the former not being able to afford their medication for a few months rather than from not walking or going to the gym like the article mentions.
1851,"This post appears to be about vaccines, please see [our FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/wiki/faq#wiki_where_can_i_find_information_about_the_mechanism_and_progress_of_vaccines.3F) for answers to frequently asked questions regarding the COVID-19 vaccines."

1856,And the US will have 600k deaths in 2020-2021 from Covid.
1857,The long-haulers will add another unknown number to this body count.
1858,Who knew that leadership would matter in a pandemic?
1859,For me it feels like decades
1860,It is strange that people still don’t look at actual stats and see that Florida is doing worse than many other places.
1861,"It’s always the “well Florida is doing good and they’re open!” No, people in Florida have been dying at twice the rate as people in NY since May."
1862,That’s not “doing good.”
1863,So the case count is high now even with the extensive testing.
1864,I hope the measures taken in Denmark will work.
1865,They should be ok anyway but you never know with this virus.
1866,Will still take awhile.
1867,The virus will still be endemic for awhile and is highly contagious/more debilitating than most seasonal influenza strains.
1868,"In a few years, vaccination for SARS-CoV-2 will likely become mandatory for travel between certain countries."
1869,"If you travel internationally, certain vaccinations are required already anyways."
1870,"now that a vaccine has been made, they no longer have to give a fuck as opposed to not giving a fuck anyways."
1871,2 in 100?
1872,Exaggerate much?

1886,Simply crazy when you think about it.
1887,"&gt; The ICU capacity measure “is standardized to reflect effective capacity in ICUs by looking at the percentage of COVID-19 positive patients in the ICU,” the department wrote."
1888,&gt; So that would mean each region has an ICU capacity that is “adjusted” to account for the intense demand for COVID-19 care.
1889,&gt; CDPH says it calculates the adjusted ICU capacity based on the proportion of ICU patients who have COVID-19.
1890,"“If a region is utilizing more than 30% of its ICU beds for COVID-19 positive patients, then its available ICU capacity is adjusted downward by 0.5% for each 1% over the 30% threshold,” according to the CDPH office of public affairs."

1945,"“THE FLU KILLS PEOPLE” well obviously it does, but inclusion is not the same as significance when it comes to data."
1946,Most of the people who died from Covid were old or obese or had some other complication already preexisting.

1982,"It’s weird, man."
1983,Obviously China did things we could and would never do to mitigate Covid but imo we own our response in its entirety at this point.
1984,In our everyday interactions with others how much sympathy do you have for someone at work who effs up royally everyday for the better part of a year and seems committed to keep doing so if they keep blaming someone who had the job before them?

2024,And WHO exactly counts as vulnerable in your eyes?
2025,Old people?
2026,Guess what young people are dying now too.
2027,I personally know of three workers all in they mid twenties who have passed and one was asymptomatic.
2028,Old age homes were under quarantine for months.
2029,Months!
2030,But because their family members don't take it seriously they are now dying.
2031,"The government didn't say for nothing for 8 months, pretty sure you didn't read my post."
2032,"South Africa is very economy conscious, because unlike the first world countries we don't get your luxuries."
2033,"Gunna tell you, what I tell my family members who don't care."
2034,"It is not about you, or how you feel it affects your rights it about the good of society."
2035,"The ONLY reason its been made illegal is because people like you refused to comply, because you think you are somehow better than the rest of us."
2036,"FYI, in SA the poor is actuality wearing their mask."
2037,"It the entitled people, who can afford fines and hospital bills who are endangering the rest of us."
2038,They should be the ones quarantined.
2039,Actuality that's perfect.
2040,You have a point instead of jail they should be put on house arrest until they learn how to act.
2041,They got the luxury to work from home anyway.
2042,Statcast mismeasured?
2043,"In a baseball game, Statcast said the homerun ball went 389 feet."
2044,"Well over the centerfield wall, which is clearly marked, 401 feet."
2045,Sometimes things don't add up for a reason...
2046,I'll leave you to decide for yourself what that reason is.
2047,Don't quit your day job
2048,I don’t like wearing masks.
2049,"There, I said it."
2050,Is there a rule that I have to like wearing masks?
2051,I don’t think so.
2052,Especially in the heat.
2053,"Once again, I will continue to wear them until I am vaccinated for the second dose."
2054,But you cannot force it on me afterwards.
2055,The media has failed people during this pandemic.
2056,"It should have provided clear, factual, contextualized data and facts about COVID, but instead it went for clickbait."
2057,Probably because this same post is being put everywhere seemingly every day
2058,It annoys the shit out of me.
2059,So I don't get it again.
2060,You can watch the portion of the interview [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PRa6t_e7dgI).
2061,"Fauci here hints that the issue is with unintended consequences, people's behaviors and possible shortages."
2062,&gt; Interviewer:  there's a lot of confusion among people and misinformation surrounding face masks.
2063,Can you discuss that?
2064,&gt; Fauci:  the masks are important for someone who is infected to prevent them from infecting someone else.
2065,"Now, when you see people and look at the films in China or South Korea or whatever, everybody is wearing a mask, right now in the United States, people should not be walking around with masks."
2066,&gt; Interviewer:  **you're sure of it?
2067,**  Because people are listening really closely to this.
2068,&gt; Fauci:  right now people shouldn't be wa... there's no reason to be walking around with a mask.
2069,"When you're in the middle of an outbreak, wearing a mask might make people feel a little bit better and it might even block a droplet, but it's not providing the perfect protection that people think that it is."
2070,"And often there are unintended consequences, people keep fiddling with the mask, and they keep touching their face."
2071,&gt; Interviewer:  And can you get some sort of schmutz staying inside there?
2072,"&gt; Fauci:  Of course, but when you think masks you should think of healthcare providers needing them and people who are ill."
2073,"The people who when you look at the films of foreign countries and you see 85% of the people wearing masks, that's fine."
2074,That's fine.
2075,"I'm not against it, if you want to do it that's fine."
2076,&gt; Interviewer:  **but it can lead to a shortage of masks?
2077,"**

&gt; Fauci:  Exactly, that's the point."
2078,It could lead to a shortage of masks for the people who really need it.
2079,"People like you = people who only mention BLM as the organization you oppose for random political reasons, and never want to talk about the movement independent of that."
2080,"You know if you talked about the movement, it would take the focus off your talking points."
2081,Nevermind that every hate group in existence supports Trump and 90%+ of your views -- someone in BLM was a Marxist once.
2082,Let's talk about that.
2083,That philosophy is a farce that only exists while a Democrat is president.
2084,"If anyone believes otherwise at this point, they're hopeless."
2085,"&gt; Spanish flu 

1918 Pandemic."
2086,Stop using location names.
2087,Why don't India do their own trial instead of waiting for the messup of trial we read about now?
2088,I feel like there’s a good chance your dad’s turn will come up before additional ones are approved.
2089,"At 67 he’d be in phase 1b, which will likely start in January for most places"
2090,"yeah I need that $600 to help make sure my kids can eat like, now though."
2091,they can't wait six months.
2092,The lockdowns will continue until compliance approves is a lame strategy
2093,We just started a couple of weeks ago.
2094,Things will improve.
2095,My comment had nothing to do with covid existing or not.
2096,What am I even simply “wrong” about?
2097,I feel like your comment is fairly irrelevant in this context.
2098,&gt; Is it because some people will die by coincidence after taking the vaccine because of the sheer number of vaccinated people and they would get sued for no reason?
2099,Basically yes.
2100,When you give a vaccine to 200 million people there is a good chance thousands or even tens of thousands will have weird medical outcomes around the same time of vaccinations.
2101,"If everyone of those went to a lawsuit, drug companies would spend billions defending themselves when virtually all of the damages were unrelated to the vaccine."
2102,imagine some shit like Ebola with the same spreading mechanism of covid.
2103,it would bring anarchy everywhere.
2104,I understand that but to call it a strict lockdown is not accurate.
2105,One of the lowest obesity rates in the country and some of the best hospitals.
2106,"The best part is these same ""conservatives"" are hardcore christians."
2107,"Like I'm pretty sure Jesus would want nothing to do with modern American conservatism, especially from an a socio-economic standpoint."
2108,"But it gives politicians publicity, and they can jump the queue."
2109,"So, for their own benefit only, they create the false public message that they'd need to get the vaccine in public to create trust, even though no anti-vaxxer will take this seriously."
2110,Defining impact as only meaning herd immunity is really stupid but okay
2111,"Scroll to near the end, the subsection with the header “How and when will life go back to normal?” There’s disagreements among the epidemiologists interviewed, but most of the responses to that questions are along the lines of “2025 or never.” One professor quoted says that “It is normal now; similar to 2019, never again.” Another says that “life will settle into a new kind of normal.”"
2112,I'm not saying that it isn't cheap but in general for poor countries.
2113,Nope
2114,what the point of vaccination if your body already experienced the virus?
2115,"Once I become an experienced virologist, I’ll get right on answering that."
2116,"In the mean time, I’ll continue not to be bother by literally the least inconvenient thing I’ve ever had to deal with."
2117,"Yes but no capacity to be everywhere, all the time."
2118,"Unlike say China with a massive police, and social enforcement systems / Surveillance that can be directed to support."
2119,"You could put all police on end to end shifts, no time off or breaks and add a fair chunk extra man power but youd soon burn out most of them and the gains would be lost very quickly."
2120,I think that story is completely made up
2121,"Groups that make up 80%+ of hospitalizations will be vaccinated by March (80+, LTCH staff and residents, HCWs, and Indigenous Canadians in remote communities)."
2122,"Unless hospitalizations somehow spike hard, I’m going to do what I want."
2123,"I’m not going to wait until hers immunity or even 50% are vaccinated, because the risk to me is low and the risk to society is also low if hospitals can handle the caseload."
2124,"I bet in three months when polling becomes more favorable he’s gonna say he had some pretty severe side effects, but that at the moment the public isn’t ready to hear that."
2125,And then there’s the 35% that will have cardiac issues for life.
2126,Definitely worse than the flu.
2127,True.
2128,"But if we're comparing L.A. County with the Netherlands, you'll see two completely different worlds when it comes to Covid measures and adherence to them."
2129,Ah...the old bait and switch.
2130,Very clever.
2131,Not.
2132,People will never take media seriously if they keep blabbering agenda based articles.
2133,"It's likely that until your body mounts a defense, (hey I remember this!)"
2134,"You can still catch it, and by virtue of it being in the lungs, there's no reason why you can't still spread it before you feel sick."
2135,"Except your body will defend you, so you won't get too sick."
2136,Just enough to fight it off.
2137,"Deaths per 1 million population:

Florida: 992."
2138,California: 621.
2139,Florida isn't doing well.
2140,No.
2141,This is bad.
2142,"First, they said you need half a dose then full dose."
2143,"Then, you need to lengthen in between doses."
2144,"Then, you need a lengthened lengthen in between doses."
2145,"They only came to this ""half dose full dose"" mistake about a month ago."
2146,"And now, you're telling me they planned ahead with those half-dose full-dose 22 weeks ago(you need 3 months data in between inoculations and then 2 months after last inoculation)?"
2147,22 weeks is half 5 and a half months or August.
2148,They would've had data for this in many countries but they ONLY made this known to the world in November AND this mistake was made in the UK only.
2149,"Like the [Global Privacy Control](https://globalprivacycontrol.github.io/gpc-spec/), successor to the Do-Not-Track header."
2150,Just because they’re an essential worker doesn’t make their death rate higher.
2151,"What I said was a fact, as 80% of the deaths are from elderly."
2152,"I'll just wait for the movie version, this article is longer than War and Peace."
2153,Yeah they've been sugarcoating the whole thing like the US has been doing
2154,"For a lot of people the goal posts were moved from ""flatten the curve"" to ""eradicate the virus"" back in spring."
2155,"Fellow space coaster, seeing the same which is really sad."
2156,"On top of this, there is reason to believe the vaccines will have an effect on transmission."
2157,They just don’t have sufficient evidence to prove it does.
2158,I wonder why?
2159,Because the trials weren’t designed for that.
2160,"FYI, Moderna has very limited data, but at least SOME data, showing the vaccines had an effect that reduced transmission."
2161,"Even if you don't like their COVID approach (I certainly don't), you can't pretend that COVID success is equivalent to other successes."
2162,China is doing fantastically with regard to containing COVID (if you don't count their lax regulations around eating diseased animals that started this mess in the first place).
2163,Would you want to be in China?
2164,That’ll be the best outcome for her.
2165,I wish the healthcare workers would all quit until they are vaccinated.

2187,"She didn't celebrate with any other family, stayed within their immediate family/household bubble."
2188,But then her Church had an in person post Thanksgiving mass.
2189,I'm not familiar as I'm not at all religious.
2190,A quick google search doesn't show anything significant for Christians/catholics around Thanksgiving so I guess it was just a Friday Mass?

2298,What's the point of getting tested?
2299,It probably is closer to 5 at this point.
2300,The data lags by about 72 hours in some states and CDC hasn’t it updated since Monday morning
2301,[removed]

2304,"Yes, I haven’t received my second shot yet and I’ll wear my mask after that one as well until the pandemic ends"

2307,"I don't think either state handled the pandemic particularly well, but it's not clear that California will have done better by the end, especially when you consider that original vaccine projections had us going through this Winter without anything approved."
2308,"While I would never argue for Florida's approach to this pandemic, California is clearly getting bailed out by a vaccine that came \~6 months earlier than expected at the start, and even under these fortuitous conditions we can't say for sure if California will even outperform Florida by the end."
2309,"California's strategy was to try to hold restrictions for long enough to make it to a vaccine, and now the will of their citizens is breaking."
2310,"It's not at all clear that if the vaccine had been developed in 18 months as Fauci (and others) originally predicted, that California's approach would have yielded any better results."
2311,Social distancing was too much for the American people for even this long.
2312,"There should have been a bigger emphasis on sustainable measures, like mass testing/contact tracing or shorter but more intense lockdowns that actually decreased cases and allowed contact tracers to keep up with infections."
2313,Basically anything that would have slowed transmission without requiring people to act in a way that is completely counterintuitive to their nature for a whole year.
2314,This approach to disease prevention is akin to dealing with the AIDS crisis by telling people to just stop having sex.
2315,Seriously.
2316,"I’ve always had a more or less pessimistic view of how we’ll tackle global warming, but this has confirmed it."

2319,"“Only about 600 tests have been conducted in outdoor settings, according to Public Health – Seattle &amp; King County...”

Very limited testing = very limited diagnosed cases."

2325,Thanks for the answer!
2326,"Bad headline, but our distribution of the vaccine so far has been a joke."
2327,So much so that the adults today actually had to make a statement about it.
2328,"The ""United"" States...what a joke"
2329,Yeah I would.
2330,I don’t think it would be fair to expect the whole world to social distance forever to protect me.
2331,UK ordered a fuckton of every vaccine.
2332,Literally enough to vaccinate their whole population 3x over if they all end up being delivered.
2333,There's no dependency on the Oxford vaccine.
2334,We’ll even see large pieces of normal return once at risk people are vaccinated.
2335,"But still on early trial phase, it will not get approved early 2021... EU made a big mistake, Germany will probably get tired and purchase some vaccines separately soon."
2336,"It is a shame Belgium will not do the same, the country is too busy at the moment fighting internally to decide which cities to vaccinate first without the other regions get jealous"

2354,What??
2355,I thought the whole point of the vaccine was to develop immunity??
2356,"From CDC's page

""COVID-19 vaccines help our bodies develop immunity to the virus that causes COVID-19 without us having to get the illness. """
2357,Am I misunderstanding something?

2362,I do remember when I got mine when I was a kid.
2363,"Look, at some point you have to go outside and face reality."
2364,I don’t work in risk assessment but if I’m a state governor I have to assess the risk of hunkering down for a very small portion of individuals who can’t take a vaccine versus the general well being of society.
2365,It's not a default and only occurs if the infectious period and mortality periods overlap - which is not the case in COVID-19.
2366,There is no reason to think that an increased infectious variant of COVID-19 would necessarily have a decreased mortality rate.
2367,[deleted]
2368,Do a little research.
2369,The “rates” they’re talking about aren’t even real.

2372,Now ... where TF do I go to GET IT?
2373,?
2374,Not at all surprised.

2376,"It was so busy at every single store on Christmas Eve, several of the big stores (target and Walmart) had no parking spots available."
2377,My husband came home from work yesterday and told me atleast 5 of his coworkers (no direct contact with them) and their wives all tested positive.
2378,I live around a bunch of idiots.
2379,Interesting.
2380,Everywhere I go they wear gloves but that’s really not many docs thankfully.
2381,They decided to work with you after you told them your getting the whole 600 dollars?
2382,I got my second shot last week and I pushed my first injection back a week and a half when everyone else was getting it.
2383,"I would say they may have preliminary results in the next two weeks or so, but I'm unsure if they're going to publish them at that point and may wait until they apply for EUA for making the details public."
2384,"I wouldn't be surprised if they released the percentages of those that have antibodies as well, since they drew blood the first visit, before the second injection, and I have a follow up visit in 3 weeks where they will draw blood again."
2385,This is something that Pfizer and Moderna did not report.
2386,[deleted]
2387,Almost every step of the way.
2388,"Hey look, it’s intentional disinformation!"
2389,Why's the smallpox one so annoying 2 weeks later?
2390,The fact that the article doesn't talk about change in rate over time means it is garbage and looking for clicks.
2391,First dose?
2392,?
2393,It’s a multi day backlog dump
2394,We do?
2395,Maybe fancy people but most just say sweater
2396,"football players take care of their health though, no?"
2397,I don't necessarily disagree with you.
2398,"But right now, anyone in support of the vaccine who is a public figure should be getting it and being vocal about it."
2399,with starlink coming to the northern middle part of the country I think more introverted Work From Home programmers types are going to be open to the idea of 20 acres of private land for pennies on the dollar.

2552,"The last sentence says:  
  
&gt;health experts say ICU capacity is a highly fluid number that *also factors in* the availability of ICU nurses, necessary equipment, and suitable space — not simply beds."

2575,Holding out 90k vaccines while only delivering 19k is criminal.
2576,"MIlitary, social workers and everybody under the sun should be enrolled to deliver the vaccines Canada hoarded so they can move on and let other better prepared countries get vaccinated."
2577,&gt;Mine was real sore but the cvs person seemed nervous and dropped the shot before he gave it to me.

2584,"This isn't new, nor is it anything radical."
2585,We have to protect our leaders and keep them alive..... theoretically.
2586,Fortunately there is a whole separate trial in the U.S. which we will be getting data from at some point in the next few months.
2587,Hopefully it provides a better picture.
2588,Then imagine how much worse the Apple pandemic will be.
2589,"Yes, thank you."
2590,Same to you two.
2591,SF had been doing pretty well for how densely populated we are but this last month has been brutal.
2592,Numbers are skyrocketing.
2593,"I get my second dose next Thursday, literally cannot wait."
2594,"Not an expert, but UTI's can cause similar issues in older women"
2595,We have by far the most vaccines administered in the world and production isn’t in the USAs hands
2596,"Haha what do you think about ""shot"" then?"
2597,Yes and no.
2598,Antibiotic use on farms will probably cause antibiotic resistant bacteria to proliferate on farms.
2599,"For example, antibiotic resistant salmonella popping up on a chicken farm."
2600,"That could potentially be a human health issue if contaminated meat got into the supply chain and sickened a bunch of humans, but those outbreaks tend to be quickly identified and stopped."
2601,"As far as normal day to day eating...no, the vast majority of meat and dairy that people eat have no traces of antibiotics left in them, and if they do, not nearly enough to cause emergent resistance in human bacteria."
2602,Maybe the COVID vaccine powerfully stimulates anti-bodies and resistence to a virus that can be far more severe than the flu?
2603,Did you check or go by feel?
2604,A slight increase in temp is very common (and for some vaccines actually associated with a better response and protection).
2605,I call these vaccines the ghost vaccines.
2606,This article is quite confusing to me.
2607,Isn’t it obvious that people with pre-existing medical conditions that make them subject to severe Covid  would need to get this vaccine?
2608,Isn’t that the whole point?
2609,Can someone help me understand what I missing?
2610,Wow.
2611,One of the better comments I’ve ever seen on Reddit.

2625,Thankfully this is the last flight I’ll have to make this pandemic (had to fly because my school kicks us out of our dorms for winter break) but I was so disappointed at how little they cared.
2626,That argument could easily be flipped around for the unvaccinated person since (s)he is the one who took the risk.
2627,"Not to mention that such a person who lacks aversion to being exposed would probably either already have antibodies through infection, or likely get it anyway."
2628,Basically someone potentially doing something stupid shouldn't be a reason to restrict someone else.

2633,That particular job was a big printing company that went belly-up a couple years ago.
2634,There are various manufacturing companies around that have their own IT departments.
2635,"We do contract out to offshore companies to help with the work, though."
2636,Finding good people in the area is not easy.
2637,A few years ago I got recruited to apply at another company and they had me take a coding test.
2638,I had to laugh because ... why?
2639,I know they're not getting very many applicants and you find out a lot more about someone's actual ability with direct interviews and good questions than some hacky test.
2640,A year later a different recruiter contacted me about a company looking to fill a position.
2641,Same company.
2642,Same position.
2643,Guess that coding test isn't working out well for them.
2644,"War, war never changes"
2645,The right to return to your home country is one of the most basic human rights we have.
2646,"We can require quarantines, but to deny that right either by either delay or straight denial is noting less than a flagrant violation of human rights."
2647,The fact you’re being downvoted is shameful.

2650,"A single 10,000 dollar freezer should be able to hold tens of thousand of vaccine doses."

2652,There has been limited testing on people who've already been infected.
2653,We obviously don't know any of the medium and long term side effects of this type of vaccine.
2654,"If you've never had covid, you should get the vaccine because the short term side effects of covid are that you die."
2655,I’m so sorry for your loss.
2656,"My mom has alzheimers, and I’m glad she’s still living with my dad for that exact reason, even though it’s getting harder and harder for my dad to take care of her himself."

2658,And so is the coronavirus.
2659,Eh no !!
2660,Never even seen it .
2661,I’m in Ireland though ... it could be hard to find .. but I will look for it 👌🏻👌🏻👍🏻👍🏻
2662,Exactly.
2663,The poor are being overwhelmingly effected since they are the ones who are doing the jobs which expose them more than anyone.
2664,"I have seen minority workers (not too many) wear their mask incorrectly, but the only people I have seen (customers) who outright break the mask law, and try to take it off in stores, or fight, are overwhelmingly white and privileged people who just want to be assholes."
2665,I'm glad South Africa is taking a stand.
2666,I just wish other countries would too because its clear the general public can not be trusted to do the right thing because they should at this point.
2667,If people can't accept the slightest inconvenience to not kill people they deserve to be punished.
2668,Everyone in this sub delusional
2669,Why do they use the same pic as the first jab?
2670,"Imagine being a person faced with getting a 95% gold-standard mRNA vaccine or the cheap “take what ya can get, peon!” 60% vaccine."
2671,Your probability of contracting COVID19 from a given period of everyday exposures is 5% if you are one of the lucky/privileged/manipulative ones to get mRNA vs. 40% for the rest of us.
2672,That is **eight** times higher risk.
2673,"Yes, it really does matter which vaccine you get."
2674,"I probably should be saying this out of my own self-interests, but I  like to think being a human being and telling the truth still matters."
2675,[deleted]
2676,The irony is almost funny.
2677,Individualism seems to be a driving factor for a lot of people to live in small rural towns in the first place.
2678,"And for that reason alone, I'm not surprised that these areas are so hostile to experts."
2679,"It's just an anecdote, but my mom prefers the small city/town life, preferably with a small patch of land."
2680,"And when the topic comes up, she's talking about basically making a bunker far away from the city."
2681,"She also doesn't trust the COVID vaccines because ""they rushed it""."
2682,And she's far from the only person I observe that in.
2683,"Even in the suburbs, it's not hard to find these toxic people who range from my mostly supportive, mostly harmless mom to full blown preppers and friends."
2684,"Stories like this just validate my feelings about small towns/rural areas, I can only speak for myself, but areas like that just make me go ""nope""."

2691,**
2692,...and?
2693,It seems no one is talking about how airlines are not issuing flight credits for passengers feeling ill. How can you expect someone who paid $1000 for a flight to  forfeit that money because they feel like they have a mild and common cold.

2695,You can relax 28 days after their first shot when they get their booster...by then they should have a good immune response
2696,Agreed.
2697,I'm happy small businesses are thriving here and we have plenty of ICU capacity and low levels of infection.

2701,Who is saying to just wear masks?
2702,We're all supposed to be wearing masks in conjunction with social distancing.
2703,I hope he is doing well.
2704,TL;DR - no perfect solution.
2705,"NZ doesn't require a negative test before you venture out after 14 days if quarantine, but Fiji does."
2706,Colleague in Fiji told me some people are still testing positive months after getting infected.
2707,"I think (disclaimer: not a scientist) that people can still show a positive test due to fragments of the virus still being present, even though they're no longer infectious or showing symptoms."
2708,"From what I've read, the longest period some people have been still infectious is close to a month after first infection, although that is rare."
2709,"The 14 day quarantine period isn't fail-safe, but it is long enough for the majority of people to stop being infectious."
2710,"To the extent the vaccine prevents infection of others (jury is still out on this), vaccinating the maskless makes sense to help protect others"
2711,"All of the major cities have mask mandates that are followed, hence our lower numbers in Florida since the summer spike."
2712,In Orlando I have yet to encounter someone not in compliance with our local ordinance.
2713,No one cares about De Santis.
2714,No
2715,Good on Canada.
2716,That’s a nice story but that makes no sense.
2717,Cases were on the decline in Oregon in August and did not start to rise until mid October.
2718,There’s plenty of science out there regarding this being seasonal in natural (like most respiratory viruses).
2719,I’d say California is a cautionary tale on being too strict.
2720,"We aren’t experiencing catastrophic community spread up here, and certainly the increases we saw had little to do with what ppl were doing 2 months before."
2721,Timelines don’t jive.
2722,Because the aerosols exhaled by the non-mask wearer can linger in the air long after any visible sign of them has passed.
2723,This shouldn’t be done by cities.
2724,It should be international by the UN.
2725,Else it’s worthless.
2726,Aren't you required to wear a mask on a plane?
2727,"Resigning yourself to death if you catch covid, despite zero scientific evidence that your conditions pose that much of a risk factor, is just living in ignorance and denial."
2728,You are no different in thought process than those idiot anti maskers.

2766,A teacher would be so happy for a question like this!
2767,"I'm so glad you asked, and the other poster has given you a great answer."
2768,We should be able to link here when people have similar questions once the general population starts to get vaccinated.
2769,I would like to know too.
2770,But one thing I think that is in China's favor is that they originally dealt with a less virulent strain of Covid19 and the government eventually locked down hard.
2771,"So while I think there death toll numbers are certainly higher, they won't be per capita bad as some places."
2772,"100%, but I think most businesses realized that trying to get opened up sooner was a quicker way to not go bankrupt than relying on the government who's done a pretty shit job paying places to stay closed."
2773,"You can’t bank, work, shop for food, or travel without it, but don’t worry, it’s not a digital ID."
2774,I am surprised by this.
2775,I have flown a few times since the start (all short flights within the US) and attendants constantly reminded passengers to keep their masks on.
2776,"&gt;you should get a reward/benefit to ""keeping yourself healthy""

&gt;You do have control over Sick

&gt;I think there should be some benefit/reward for me being so dedicated

2801,Ain’t nobody dying of COVID in fucking Nigeria.
2802,Sounds a little like the national socialist workers party... that didnt end well.
2803,No one is trying to move here for small towns
2804,"Technically nothing, there are a few things that are going to happen before that."
2805,Most importantly the daily deaths will have plummeted by then.

2814,Erie County NY has had cases decline 4 weeks in a row and hospitalization have gone down a little (plateaued).
2815,"Everyone I know, took TDay seriously."
2816,The mask is an acknowledgement of the universality of human experience which capitalist subjectivity works so hard to deny.
2817,"Once you recognize the necessity of wearing a mask, you have to admit that the idea of a common welfare is necessary."
2818,This reality is an affront to the conservative ideal of the self-sufficient individual.
2819,Is it because they're typically not very rich as these jobs are usually wildly underpaid?
2820,I highly encourage you to spend a few hours (wish I could say it takes minutes) reading the history of mRNA research (e.g.
2821,Moderna and BioNTech) and see how this technology is a decade(ish) in the making.

2836,Is the worldometer site still reliable for stats in the US?
2837,I saw recently they added the VA as its separate source- but the VA hospitals are all in different states- would this be a double count or accounted for?

2858,"We can only prove a reinfection if it is a different strain, to show that it can't just be the first infection."
2859,"This proof stuff is separate from whether a vaccine will work on different strains, and so far, it should work on different strains."

2861,There’s people who’ve done everything right and still got it.

2865,"Here are FOUR good reasons to wear one:
- It saves lives."
2866,- It speeds up the return to normal.
2867,Travel and fun outings will return faster.
2868,"- You can die from COVID, even if you are young."
2869,You know why?
2870,"If a hospital is full of COVID cases, they will not be able to give YOU treatment for say, a car accident (which can happen at any age)."
2871,"A mask could save your life, since it reduces hospitalizations, which means hospitals are more likely to have a space for you should you have a non-COVID emergency."
2872,- You can avoid paying expensive fines for not wearing a mask.
2873,"If you feel so strongly about not wearing one, then there is always the option of staying home and using contactless delivery services until the health crisis passes."
2874,"___And remember, masks go over the nose and mouth.___"
2875,Honestly it's way too past being civil on this topic to just let them roam around and not have any consequences for their actions.
2876,If jail seems too harsh than I suggest house arrest for the political assholes and for the idiots we just need to get them more educated on the subject.
2877,Even though it's obviously common sense and good decency to wear a fucking mask to help slow a virus.
2878,The new variant has a few differences on the spike.
2879,"Antibodies are made by your immune system for multiple places on the spike when you are vaccinated with one of the mRNA vaccines or ChAdOx1, or are infected, and it is unlikely that the new variant (not a strain) has enough changes on the spike to make much of a difference overall."
2880,"However, it is more likely (not sure how much more) that monoclonal antibodies would have their effectiveness reduced, as they are only one specific kind of antibody, for one spot on the spike (iirc)."
2881,I’ve heard from a interview that long term effects  are rare and anything significant after a vaccine is taken is after 2 months.
2882,"So within a 2 month window after a vaccine is taken is usually the time it takes to see the side effects, anything after 2 months is very rare."
2883,If anything I would be more worried about the long term effects of having had covid.

That is so fucking funny to me considering all the holier than thou comments by Californians on here."
2890,UK is less antivaxxer than the US.
2891,Plus once you get high enough levels of vaccinations across the population COVID will die out anyway due to herd immunity.
2892,You get the vaccine to achieve that not protect yourself.
2893,We will achieve herd immunity far quicker by dosing as many people with a 65% effective vaccine (as well as some with the 95% effective vaccine) than having to wait for the mRNA vaccines to eventually come through.
2894,Estimates suggest we could reach that point as early as late March in the absolute best case scenario.
2895,Less than 10 million population too.

2911,Very true.
2912,I think the point was more that an hourly employee has the additional pressure of losing out on pay if they don’t go in.

2924,"They didn’t even check my temperature on the flight and they even gave us food to eat on a 3-hour flight, thereby encouraging people to take off their masks."
2925,I already felt guilty enough for flying but my biggest mistake was flying United.

2927,"You're right, it can't, because gender is NOT inherent."
2928,Gender is made up and we can do whatever we want with our gender roles and expression.

2943,Airports felt like they were back to levels they were at last Christmas.

2950,Taking a dump on “paragons of virtue” is unfair - expecting everyone to wear a mask during a highly infectious pandemic is not too much to ask.
2951,"It’s less about the individual, and more about the broader population."

2957,The point vaccination is to give people that immunity without them getting infected so no it does not.
2958,"Granted, long term immunity from infection might mean the two vaccines and natural immunity compounded in the population might bring us to herd immunity faster than expected"
2959,Everybody had months to prepare for the rollout of the vaccine.

3487,"I believe I saw that Russia was up over 200,000...."
3488,Well you get to decide if your salary is more important than other people’s lives
3489,"Why assume ""malicious"" when it's other countries doing it then?"
3490,Seems like a double standard when there could be other factors at play.
3491,Yeah.
3492,There is a vast difference of morals and ethics here.
3493,Relationships where that happens are... Not good.
3494,And I want to buy groceries naked and they shun me.
3495,Hypocris at its finest.
3496,Did they change the 75k threshold?
3497,Well that’s how the pandemic gets worse
3498,I think the difference is that we matter to our coworkers.
3499,Because our presence or absence effects them.
3500,But we ultimately don’t matter to the company.
3501,"But it's easier to enforce that, everyone had to move through one government checkpoint."

3511,Absolute insanity.
3512,"Yep, we just don't have the money for it."
3513,Alot of states were operating on borrowed money before the crisis.
3514,I'm sure they are seeing their tax revenue tank and really just planning on how to cut the fat let alone offer more services.
3515,"I’m exactly in the same boat, I normally travel 60-70% of the year but I only foresee getting a vaccine in Germany around September-October timeframe given the current fuck-up."
3516,I fully understand and support both the approach of vaccination of the people at risk and healthcare personnel first as well as requiring a vaccin passport.
3517,I just hope that these rules also try to accomodate for those of us that do need to travel once things get back to somewhat of a normalcy
3518,They also need to do this as a YouTube video since many people don't read.

3524,Doctors and nurses in many areas are already working 70-80 hours a week.
3525,"Moreover, they're doing it in what is basically a nightmare, completely isolated when they get off work or worried that they're going to pass the disease to their own family"
3526,People will have New Year’s gatherings no matter what the recommendations are.
3527,"Why don’t governments provide monitored outdoor areas with patio heaters (in places such as parks), have separate areas for alcohol and no alcohol, and at least then people will host gatherings outside instead of inside."
3528,Plus it can be monitored to prevent crimes and to make sure that there aren’t 100 people standing within 6 feet of each other without masks.
3529,Had a coworker a few years ago come in coughing like crazy.

3797,"I was pointing out that the US would have gotten those doses earlier than the EU would have (2nd quarter vs end of 3rd quarter), so, in comparison, the US not locking in those doses when they could have seems like more of a mistake."
3798,"&gt; I recently got my first dose and a family member was like ""can we get together then?"""
3799,"I understand some people think being vaccinated brings down the risks down considerably, but then indulge in risky practices because well they got vaccinated."
3800,"But it still takes a week or two to build immunity, and then the second shot is needed."
3801,"Even then protracted exposure to covid positive people, or exposure in high environments harboring covid virus like hospitals/respiratory units will increase the risk of infection despite being vaccinated."
3802,The only good thing might be is the symptoms may not be severe at all.
3803,But vaccinations does not mean not wearing a mask at all.
3804,Just that mask wearing will be reduced in many places.
3805,but definitely need to be used in risky environments and high density congregation places.
3806,&gt; If you look at US military spending as a percentage of GDP (3.4%) it really isn't that out of line when compared to the rest of the world (2.2%).
3807,That we really shouldn't spend.
3808,"We could cut 400 billion and still be ahead of China, the second place."
3809,We could somehow miraculously fund our failing healthcare and pandemic systems!
3810,"&gt; Furthermore ""suffering?"""
3811,"we are a bunch of entitled crybaby fuckwits who have known nothing but prosperity

Okay tell that to [2.5 million homeless children](https://www.air.org/center/national-center-family-homelessness#:~:text=A%20staggering%202.5%20million%20children,children%20in%20the%20United%20States.)"

3818,**
3819,When does the 2nd dose get administered?
3820,This is how you get shot.
3821,We are vaccinating palestinians who are Israeli citizens (who are above 60 years old/work in healthcare or elderly care)
3822,It would take a very very unfortunate mutation for COVID to get like that.
3823,Even MERS only kills like 20% or something.
3824,"You'd need something like MERS, but with COVID's contagious nature, and somehow also make it even more deadly, or unable to gain immunity for, or something."
3825,"Its almost an impossible scenario but sure, in some universe it could occur I guess."
3826,"If some pandemic really got to a point where its killing 10%+ of people and is as contagious as COVID, I'd honestly be just as worried about the societal and economic collapse it would cause, the famines and riots and chaos, over the actual disease itself."
3827,"Yes, when 85 year olds die, they still have a cause of death."
3828,And flying is safe?
3829,[removed]
3830,Apparently everything filters up to the CDC's master immunization database.
3831,The specs are located here: https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/covid-19/reporting/requirements/index.html
3832,"Given how isolated most countries have been during the pandemic, it is likely that there are very many more variants of the virus that we haven't fully detected yet."
3833,&gt;So you just want this virus to keep mutating and go on forever right?
3834,Until we get a new dominant version that the vaccine doesn’t work for so we never return to normal life?
3835,Do you think there is any alternative?
3836,Do you think you are going to stop mutation of a virus?
3837,Do you think you are going to some how constrain it to a limited number of strains across the entire planet?
3838,Are you fucking delusional?
3839,Soon.

3843,I agree but I think it will hard to convince most people to follow that.
3844,Virus fatigue is weighing heavily on most people.
3845,It's great to be hopeful but I see a lot of misinformed comments which believe the vaccine will prevent one from being infectious

3847,Well that’s why YOU should not fly.
3848,How much deadlier is it compared to the Spanish Flu?
3849,[removed]
3850,"Anyone outside of the USA + 50% of the USA:

3851,How long does the covid vaccine work for?
3852,[deleted]
3853,Right there's no evidence to suggest they prevent you from being infectious.
3854,"They might, they might not."
3855,They're not like other vaccines.
3856,"Well, with modern medicine a lot of previously brutal pandemics would be non-starters today."
3857,"Like plague, for example, we have a cure for that but in the past it devastated us."
3858,"I think if COVID were around 200 years ago, with no ventilators and no understanding of how diseases spread, it would have been a MUCH different story than it is today."
3859,I keep hearing “breaking point” and ..
3860,I know it’s bad and all but I think people are misusing that term.
3861,I work in a kitchen and have a red rash that is terrible on my ear from mask and heat.
3862,I’ll wear it until it’s safe but not a day fucking more.
3863,The studio isn't letting random people stroll onto the set.
3864,It's a much more controlled environment than a restaurant.
3865,And they're testing their workers often daily.
3866,All of them.
3867,Until you get second dose 21 days later you are only at best 50% protected this is not surprising
3868, I’ve done two of those three jobs and come from a family of ER nurses.
3869,Assaults and robberies definitely happen.
3870,Career criminal or otherwise.
3871,Firefighters probably get it less than the other two because they usually have police with them when arriving on scene.
3872,They opened special centers a few months ago because of high demand for the flu vaccines.
3873,they are using the same ones.
3874,"thats still amazing though, more than 1% of the population each day, atleast until we run out of our available vaccinces."
3875,Are you guys even trying?
3876,You will have so many leftover old people sucking at your social services unless you let Covid do it's thing.
3877,They have been working on this technology since MERS in 2012.
3878,It is not new.
3879,They were able to modify it for COVID-19.
3880,"Also, both vaccines show similar protection in cumulative incidence curves for the first two weeks and then they separate."
3881,[removed]
3882,"Still amazing news that within days, all care home residents in Norway will be vaccinated."
3883,More than half of the deaths in Norway is at such institutions and this will already have a huge impact on the statistics in Norway.
3884,I'm not sure I'd want to take a plane that didn't require a vaccine passport.
3885,You'd think the Airlines would want this to prove safety.
3886,"South African alcohol abuse is different to, I assume, Americas."
3887,We have problems with alcohol but the ban being put in place is supported by [evidence](https://www.sabcnews.com/sabcnews/direct-link-between-alcohol-abuse-and-trauma-admissions/) to reduce hospital trauma admissions to reduce the burden experienced by hospitals.
3888,"Withdrawal and rehab luckily can often be handled by different facilities but our large state hospitals are at capacity and reducing admissions that are from alcohol (stabbings, gun shots, car accidents, domestic violence etc.)"
3889,allows our doctors to better focus.
3890,"Different countries deal with things differently, in SA we found that removing the sale of alcohol and introducing a curfew with social gatherings banned allows us to control our admissions."
3891,"Here’s how trump is doing it:

October 30

“Our doctors get more money if someone dies from Covid,” and so “when in doubt choose Covid.”

November 1

U.S. death toll passes 230,000

November 1

“Biden wants to LOCKDOWN our Country, maybe for years."
3892,Crazy!
3893,There will be NO LOCKDOWNS.
3894,The great American Comeback is underway!!
3895,"!”

November 2

“Joe Biden is promising to delay the vaccine and turn America into a prison state—locking you in your home while letting far-left rioters roam free."
3896,"The Biden Lockdown will mean no school, no graduations, no weddings, no Thanksgiving, no Christmas, no Fourth of July”

November 2

“We have more Cases because we have more Testing!”

https://doggett.house.gov/media-center/blog-posts/timeline-trump-s-coronavirus-responses"
3897,Shows what happens when you bring old and stupid together.
3898,Some of the justification the first time around is the high amount of alcohol related injuries accidents and crime that increases hospital needs.
3899,The other part is to reduce domestic violence as gender based violence is high here.
3900,Then there is the lack of common sense for other people that alcohol decreases common sense and increases Covid risky behaviors.
3901,Yes it’s danger to the alcoholics but it’s still about protecting hospital capacity.
3902,"I don’t think it’s fun, but I don’t want to see hospital workers further infected so I can buy beers."
3903,South Africans drink a lot more than other countries by volume.
3904,"He may have not been “willing” but how BADLY he botched the pandemic response, he has given China the best gift they could imagine."
3905,I think its wrong calling it anti vaxxers.
3906,Almost all people are for vaccines.
3907,"But within the pro vaccines group, there is a number of people against the covid vaccine (for now)."
3908,"calling them anti vaxxers is mussing the point, for them."
3909,"people are scared because in this case, governments are proposing wild laws, and giving advanced possibilities for companies that benefit from covid therapies and vaccines."
3910,"Personally, i know its not bad by defention that companies csn benefit while doing good."
3911,"But people also understand, that laws are changed to make it possible for vaccines to roll out early."
3912,While its logical to think we didnt have those safeguards for nothing.
3913,"i take flu vaccines, also some months ago."
3914,No problem.
3915,"Will probably take the covid vaccine (in my country we dont have the option yet), but i understand the usually pro vaccine people, being a bit sceptic at this time."
3916,"for flu vaccines we never had governments pushing extreme law changes, that negate choosing what you want for your body, buf making it a governments choice, what you get injected into you."
3917,"that is a Major change, without a need for that change."
3918,"there is no actual real data, with people refusing available vaccines, in high numbers."
3919,"And evdn if allot of people refused, it would be an sxtreme choice of letting governments implement law, where personal body ownership is no longer a given."
3920,That change will open pandora's box.
3921,Really makes you wonder if the Pfizer/moderna would hold up as well in the Brazilian health care group.
3922,"Not saying that numbers are wrong, just that seems more of a worst case scenario stress test."
3923,"Also, Brazil had higher community transmission and likely more Covid mutations."
3924,From an experimental design standpoint it becomes difficult to directly compare results between trials.
3925,I don't think the new strain is responsible for the numbers(yet).
3926,The higher numbers are probably because the young people have to work to support themselves and because they are less likely to have a severe case they are not taking as many precautions.
3927,Did you listen to him on the latest episode of How to Vaccinate the World podcast?
3928,"If not, you should."
3929,"Strangely, you missed RT."
3930,"The virus will likely become endemic, but I can think of no good reason to have lockdowns five years from now barring a new pandemic"
3931,"When high percentages of hospital capacities are reached due to alcohol related incidents, you have to make some sort of plan to make space for those with covid."
3932,We dont have the medical infrastructure of first world countries.
3933,"If you are really that dependent on alcohol, the doctor can prescribe you something"
3934,Pretty much my viewpoint as well.

4103,They pre-book you to make sure that everyone with first will have second.
4104,I'm currently in the between shot group which means for me to be full vaccinated they'll want to make sure I complete.
4105,If not I become a wasted vaccine and a risk to others.
4106,I'll be expected so now scheduled into the 2nd injection window with the numbers accounted for.
4107,That day they may have extras again for their first round 5 min call again.
4108,"As we're still learning how to mass vaccinate I'd imagine the margin of error will reduce with experience but as every injection counts at the moment, the more people who can be injected the better!"

4121,*
4122,Well 80k for December wasn't far off unfortunately...
4123,Just because the US sucks doesn’t make China not suck.
4124,Because it's inhumane.
4125,"You cannot just cut alcoholic off from alcohol, because DT are deadly to a very high degree."
4126,That's why no progressive country would enact such a policy without also having enough capacity to actually treat those addicts.
4127,Like withdrawal from a daily alcohol addiction is literally lethal if not given antiseizure meds in hospital or slowly weaned off.
4128,"So all this policy would do is make these people criminals just to safe their lives, or make them end up in hospital and waste resources."
4129,Man disproportionate death rate demonstrates bias of U.S health care system
4130,And trumps/white house top defense ss marine lost a leg.
4131,"I'm also in the UK, tier 2 where I live."
4132,"I like your optimism; you trust that people will follow the rules, but I saw the footage of people rushing to the train station on the evening that tier 4 was announced."
4133,I'm pretty sure there will have been a lot of selfish people refusing to follow the rules.
4134,"Even though tier 2 was able to have small gatherings, I still stayed at home."
4135,I don't see why cancelling Christmas plans for one year is such a big deal for so many people.
4136,and you posted this knowing that this was back in 2012?
4137,This is probably insult to injury.
4138,Yeah because trump cared about the Muslims in China at all.
4139,"Spoiler, he didn’t and they are screwed until China fucks up another country closer to the west"
4140,That is possible sure!
4141,And businesses are completely in their right to refuse people without vaccines
4142,I’m not sure what your point is?
4143,"People very close to me work in ICUs and there are MANY people on ventilators, both old and younger."
4144,"And just because YOU might be fine, doesn’t mean the person next to you would be."
4145,Take care of yourself and them and *get the vaccine*.
4146,Well said.
4147,"I'm in Melbourne Australia and we had a $200 first offence fine if we didn't wear a mask outside our home, the only exceptions allowed were medical exemptions and strenuous exercise."
4148,It was introduced with a three day grace period and by day four 95% of the people were wearing masks.
4149,"There were complaints from the usual reactionary snowflakes on the right but they were heavily outnumbered and we got together and smashed Covid, belted it straight back over the bowler's head and over the sight screen for six."
4150,"Good luck with it in SA, stick together and you'll beat it."
4151,But they genuinely didn't have tests or the capability to test.
4152,"What do you want them to have done, just put out a rough guess everyday?"
4153,I am one of those nurses (did not leave a staff position though).
4154,It’s extremely hard to turn down these opportunities when you live in the Midwest and are a newly single mom.
4155,The biggest issue is the mega corporations that bought out all of the rural hospitals and then drove them into the ground.
4156,"They have the money, they just don’t want to fairly compensate  their staff."
4157,I'm hitting a paywall.
4158,Any way you can post the text?
4159,"I don't like the idea that you need to work from home when you are sick (and should be resting) but yeah, if you are unsure about health or if there is an emergency most things today can be easily done from home."
4160,I don’t understand the logic behind the federal bureaucracy overseeing all 50 states being somehow more efficient than more localized actions
4161,"Yes, yes, the West invades other countries and interferes in other countries, always to protect the world
Ask the children of Iraq and Afghanistan how you should atone for your sins"
4162,Goood
4163,"because now in some countries you can get fined for not calling people their proper pronouns, that’s messed up."
4164,"you get fined for hurting someone’s feelings, that’s government overreach"
4165,We have the best patients in the world.... thanks to jail.
4166,Well said.
4167,Everyone is so worried about the minorities being marginalised in this thread.
4168,In South Africa the minority is wealthy white people.
4169,"In US, poor white people are probably worse than poor black people wrt mask wearing."
4170,And who will suffer most when Covid wreaks havoc?
4171,The poor!
4172,The mask laws are important for them.
4173,"In South Africa, laws are not as strict as other countries."
4174,"Police just have so much to do, they will pick and choose when to enforce smaller laws."
4175,"Before this law, the police was powerless in enforcing the lockdown, and people ignored them."
4176,Now our healthcare system is collapsing.
4177,Or people who have connections to doctors and the ultra-wealthy.
4178,They should have like a spin-off tier.
4179,Soooooo many in California jumping the line.
4180,That is good to hear.
4181,"The concern though is that as people breath out, their breath is still hanging around in a confined space and has the opportunity to be breathed in by someone else before it reaches the air filters."
4182,"Just because you ""feel safe"" doesn't mean you are safe."
4183,"I know tons of people who ""feel safe"" but aren't."
4184,"Droplets can be transmitted on a plane, just like they can anywhere else, and social distancing usually isn't good enough."
4185,And there is a higher density of people.
4186,Cannot be disputed.
4187,"these people who are causing problems,  and banned.. are they put on a no- fly list for all airlines?"
4188,[removed]
4189,And elderly care homes!!
4190,"Someone got tested positive and still went in because they wanted to see their mother... massive outbreak on every floor, elderly and staff have it."
4191,We couldn’t see our grandmother because of it and won’t see her until January.
4192,It was truly a merry christmas.
4193,"Fuck that, this is exactly what our elderly, high risk grandmother needs."
4194,They’re not even charging the cunt that did it!
4195,It is confirmed it blocks the disease.
4196,"We don't know whether or how much it prevents infection, or transmission in case of infection."
4197,This does not mean we know it does not prevent these things.
4198,I also think there are several ways to still fly and be more responsible.
4199,Although this is biased as I'm literally home for Christmas.
4200,"I self isolated in the week leading up to my flight home, got tested before and after flying, I then self isolated for a week upon arrival, got tested, and then went and saw my family."
4201,On the way back ill be testing before flying and then self isolating until a negative test in my work country.
4202,"Sure it's not essential travel, but by doing stuff like that I was actually the least likely to have corona in the house as other people take public transport or work with the public"
4203," The ""Western media"" is not trying to deal specifically with China
Rather, there is a long term, systematic bias."
4204,"Just look at all the news headlines about China for yourself, and you'll see, just do a random search

The Chinese government is considered untrustworthy, and by ""who""?"
4205,"Don't ignore the subject matter, it's ridiculous."
4206,"I was a witness to the baby milk incident in 2008, and I know very well that counterfeit dairy farmers and milk companies are much more abominable than the government, and that even now Chinese people will not buy domestic baby milk, except for a few who still insist on their own brands in 2008."
4207,"If you have really lived in China, you should know that China and the Western description of China are completely different things, you can safely leave your home at night, you can quickly take the high-speed rail to go anywhere, when COVID-19 came, we seriously implement the government's epidemic prevention policy, Wuhan people, Hubei people really do not go out at home for 100 days, in exchange for the current epidemic prevention results

If you say I don't think Chinese vaccines are credible in China, you won't get checked back, but you will be considered untrustworthy because you have no evidence."
4208,"Solving problems is always more important than perceived struggles, and the Chinese know this very well

Forget it, I really don't want to argue
You know what, you keep saying ""I'm doing it for the good of the Chinese""
But have you ever asked the Chinese themselves, ""What can I do for you?"""
4209,"And the truth is we don't need you to do what's best for us, we know what we should do."
4210,"It’s only one country so, yeah ."
4211,USA
4212,The beatings will continue until morale improves
4213,I don't think Lil Pump will enjoy breathing from a pump if he gets COVID.
4214,Triage is a thing.
4215,This is what New Orleans hospitals had to do when Katrina hit.
4216,This is what hospitals do during wartime when resources are extremely limited.
4217,South African police run on bribes so that is exactly what is going to happen with law from OP's article.
4218,"What's interesting is that Israel's mortality rate per confirmed case is among the lowest in the world ([~0.84%, ranked 146/174](https://www.statista.com/statistics/1105914/coronavirus-death-rates-worldwide/))."
4219,"So if on top of that, everyone over 60 gets vaccinated by next week, the death toll should get close to 0 in two months and the country could fully reopen."
4220,He said he purposefully lied to avoid a run on masks.
4221,"Right or wrong, it was a lie."

4223,They could lose the house at midterm if he tried that.
4224,"Just as an example on why to wait a few days on more data, most NYC testing sites closed on Christmas."
4225,Obviously this is going to impact the numbers.
4226,"Not only that, but after the second shot you get a $1 churro."
4227,And Tom Cruise agrees with you
4228,"What's interesting is that Israel's mortality rate per confirmed case is among the lowest in the world (~0.84, ranked 146/174)."
4229,"So if on top of that, everyone over 60 gets vaccinated by next week, the death toll should get close to 0 in two months and the country could fully reopen."
4230,if this is based on a tiny subgroup of a study with a huge margin of error i’m gonna lose my mind
4231,Anti-vaxxers aren't a 'population' so your point is invalid.
4232,"Though, they might share a lot in common with actual population subgroups-- such as those below the midpoint on the intelligence bell curve."

4240,Please retract the comment or hopefully a moderator will address this spreading of false and dangerous misinformation
4241,"any government could make out it is historically a victim ALWAYS and NEVER a perpetrator, when they have control of the narrative."
4242,"This almost always happens in authoritarian countries, the more authoritarian, the more extreme the narrative becomes."
4243,"FYI I am not a Westerner, I am an anti-colonialist and anti-racist, but I think your position is stupid."
4244,"Constantly whining about things that happened to your country 180 years ago, whilst insisting that your government and country is morally superior really just makes people believe that you really are indoctrinated."
4245,"I don't think Chinese people are stupid - you don't have to be stupid to be brainwashed at all, especially when you are sent the same nefarious messages from birth (you are powerless against the government, you are the victim of foreigners, china is superior, CCP protects Chinese, etc)."
4246,"At the same time, many Chinese people don't support the government but of course, we can never know how many because they cannot publicly say this."
4247,So government needs to provide for these businesses.
4248,"Not just say oh well you put your life savings into this successful business pre pandemic, and since we fucked it up good luck I guess?"
4249,Start a new one?
4250,It’s so shitty government has provided way more help to millionaires and billionaires than any small business owner
4251,Meh.

4374,2 million is a lot of doses administered but it’s a far cry from the 20m they planned for the end of the year.
4375,My ex just got it because she works at an eye doctor as a secretary.

4377,"Definitely for the Moderna one, the side effects get notable worse."
4378,"From a quick glance, Pfizer's seems to only be a slight jump, but I haven't looked at it closely."

4383,"I take covid seriously and support reasonable restrictions and mask mandates, but the timing of this announcement and with ongoing vaccine distribution, this really sounds to me like an organization trying to quickly urge members into giving them more money and power before the crisis ends and the public forgets who the WHO is anymore..."

4391,"The true proportion of asymptomatic cases is still not known because it's very hard to study (hard to tell apart asymptomatic, presymptomatic, and very mild, among other complications), but most likely true asymptomatics are less than 50% in all age groups."

4403,Have you Westerners ever apologized for that?
4404,Have you ever asked to return the Chinese relics in the British Museum and the Louvre?
4405,Why is China not a victim?
4406,"This has nothing to do with the Chinese Communist Party, which also fell into self-collapse in the early years of its rule, but since the reform and opening up, the Chinese people have been able to live a dignified life

You always think that Chinese people are stupid and have been brainwashed by the Chinese government
And what is the truth?"
4407,You only remember that there are people in China when your interests are compromised and you are really thinking about the Chinese people?

4462,"Yeah, if you're comparing people to Trump they will always look good."
4463,That's easy.
4464,You should compare Fauci against other medical professionals who refuted him in the early days.
4465,Then why are you rambling?
4466,"Again, what was the ""that"" which you claim was some kind of contradiction?"
4467,What is your point?

4485,"That's really quite hard to fathom, I knew it was low, but that's shocking."
4486,"Anyway, I said ""seeded"", not ""dominant""."
4487,"There's just no scenario in which Denmark, which sequences 20-25% of cases, finds 9 - and Australia finds 2 - where the US has somehow avoided it."
4488,"Unless somehow it's less effective in the US (climate/density - who knows), one would expect it to follow the UK's path and become more dominant over time."

4496,"Covid-19 currently has a 3% fatality rate world wide, so 3-8% being ""x10 as lethal"" seems a bit hyperbolic."
4497,Yes.
4498,Punish the people not at risk who wait for the sake of others health.
4499,Punish them by not letting them travel!
4500,"comeon we all know its the main cause, if someone has medical issues how can they take care of their finances and job and other things?"
4501,If they have financial issues it's fine they can just work more and retire later....
4502,"KF94 masks are used in medical settings in Korea, including by the nurses at Korean covid testing centers and initial examination."
4503,They are essentially equivalent to a KN-95 mask but I have more faith in KF-94s due to quality issues with many KN-95 manufacturers.
4504,"Korean testing centers keep the people being tested outside, obviously for a reason."
4505,"Although most of the medical staff are behind plexiglass (computer intake person, second intake check person, and tester who uses rubber gloves rough the plexiglass to test you, then you put your sealed swabs into a refrigerator yourself) at least one nurse is outside among the people being tested to direct you where to go initially."
4506,"There are also frequently support staff, including drivers (they generally don't want you walking home which is allowed - public transport not allowed of course - after being tested)

Korean Airport quarantine people also wear KF94 masks, including the medical screeners."
4507,"Although inbound traveler numbers are greatly reduced due to covid in general plus restrictions, there are around 20-25 people a day coming into the country who test positive for covid."
4508,"For inpatient covid care, Korean medical staff use PAPRs (self-contained respirators)."
4509,"Initially, the Korean CDC said KF94 or PAPRs but in the news stories you see them wearing PAPRs now."
4510,That's good and better than much of the world.
4511,I have a family member who cared for critical covid patients in the USA and it was N-95s.
4512,Family member and her staff ensured new N-95 each day by breaking the elastic.
4513,"They had them available, it was a cost issue."
4514,Never contracted covid.
4515,KF94 masks come in many different fits.
4516,"There are 3 sizes (small, medium, large) but many fits in each size."
4517,There are also clips and loops used to further tighten them.
4518,Most adults use size large but you have to try a few different ones until you find a brand with your fit.
4519,KF94 masks are very inexpensive now at around US $0.37 per mask for the least expensive ones if you buy 50 online.
4520,Ones with more unique fits and those whose input is 100% Korean cost around $0.50-$0.60 in quantity online.
4521,Children's masks can cost up to $1.00.
4522,The pricing is interesting because pre-pandemic they were around $1.50 - $2.00 or more each.
4523,"Pricing came down because everyone rushed into producing them, partly because the government agreed to purchase a set amount initially (70% then 80% I believe)."
4524,Supply increased and prices came down.
4525,Almost nobody in Canada is immune; why does that matter?
4526,The concern with this variant is that it is (subject to high uncertainty) more transmissible and/or more virulent.
4527,"Damn, if that's what they're admitting, imagine how bad the truth is."
4528,"First one that pops up searching r/covid19 for ""mask meta analysis""."

How exactly is that supposed to work?"
4533,Never going to happen.
4534,Keep dreaming.
4535,And no one is claiming that illegals have made the pandemic worse in the US.
4536,There’s no evidence of that.
4537,"The claim is that the porous border with Mexico, with 5,000+ completely uncontrolled border crossings each day from COVID-19 hotspots makes any attempt at the New Zealand/Australia strategy of lockdown until eradication completely pointless."
4538,The only way to successfully implement that strategy is to enforce a 14-day quarantine on every single person entering the country.
4539,Thousands of people entering illegally with no 14-day quarantine would put you back at square one immediately.
4540,There is no way to eradicate the virus without a controlled border (which we don’t have).
4541,"The only weird irony in this is that while all of this is happening, people are more relaxed in California than ever before during the pandemic."
4542,People just don't care or aren't taking this seriously or don't keep up with the news or don't believe its true.
4543,Absence of evidence is not at all the same as evidence of absence.
4544,It’s extremely dangerous to develop policy based on assumptions of protection.
4545,All you're saying is that the ends justify the means.
4546,I'm not sure I agree with you there
4547,Don’t worship people and don’t make them a saint or heroes.
4548,This was a new pandemic and information was being released/reviewed/revised as new things came to light.
4549,Atleast Fauci didn’t deliberately shut down info and stats like Trump did.
4550,That’s even worse.

4561,LOL!
4562,We don't.
4563,And we won't.
4564,California would have to more than double their number of deaths per capita and cases per capita to catch up with SD or ND.
4565,"There's also no evidence against it as far as I know, and it is typical for vaccinations to prevent the spread of disease as well."
4566,"Unless I am incredibly misinformed here, in which case please let me know how and why, I'm curious."
4567,"That said, I'm going to be wearing a mask and distancing for the foreseeable future either way for the sake of safety."
4568,People need to be realistic about the limitations of this vaccine.
4569,There is zero evidence that it is sterilizing.
4570,Behavior like yours demonstrates a false sense of security.
4571,Takes money to makes money
4572,So even with the vaccine we're going be sick with coughing and sneezing?
4573,"Just not the ""long covid"" stuff like heart and brain damage?"
4574,Pretty sure I’ve only had a real flu once.
4575,Non-stop spewing out of both ends.
4576,Just absolute brown water squirting out of my butt.
4577,"And violent vomiting at the slightest provocation, to include the smell of my own diarrhea, so I was puking into a bucket while simultaneously on the toilet pissing out of my ass."
4578,"And the worst part is that I didn’t eat for probably 3 days straight, and somehow the diarrhea just kept on coming."
4579,"Once my stomach was completely empty my body still continued to attempt to puke up the nothingness, and that dry heaving is almost worse straining to get something out."
4580,"When I wasn’t purging, I was passed out."
4581,"No idea for how long, lost track of the time and days because it was just sleep, wake up by the need to shit/puke, try to sip some pedialyte, right back to sleep."
4582,At one point my roommates couldn’t wake me up and had 911 dialed until I muttered a response.
4583,"Not necessarily from the sickness itself, but the weakness of being utterly depleted."
4584,"It was either the flu or food poisoning, idk."
4585,"Either way, ever since then I get annoyed at sick people in public and am very careful with my food."
4586,[deleted]
4587,"Me either, Son and I am doing everything for mom, and we can't afford to get sick.Don't forget that for everyone ahead of you in line that gets the vaccine, there will be that many more people who won't be getting it either."
4588,but deep down you know you're already part of the lizard tribe.

4595,"And we are at 300,000 deaths."
4596,Feel better now?
4597,I had a company do the same thing to me.
4598,"I had 2 surgeries and when I was rdy to go back, the company called and said the doctor office didn't send in the paper work."
4599,They kept saying it was not there for three days then fired me for not having the doctor's office fax the paper work over.
4600,The doctor's office did send it in I watched them do it twice.
4601,The joys of a right to work state.
4602,My point was it can be misinterpreted to mean that the vaccine doesn't work.
4603,Holy shit I never knew Mexico went through that.
4604,That's terrifying
4605," &gt;The difference is even more significant for African Americans – the study said, “Importantly, melatonin usage is associated with a 52% reduced likelihood of a positive laboratory test result for SARS-CoV-2 in African Americans.”

That's very interesting."

4607,TIL I'm a cannibal.
4608,I'll bet dollars to donuts that it's already been here for a while.
4609,The new strain has been traced back to at least September; restricting travel now is weeks too late.
4610,That's terrifying.
4611,I wonder how many people will kill their parents because they read too many conspiracies on Facebook.
4612,"Remember we need to shut down restaurants and all small businesses because 20 people in a building is a danger to public health but 200 on a pressurized air capsule, sitting shoulder to shoulder, coming into contact with hundreds if not thousands from all over the country, and for a trip lasting several hours is a non issue."
4613,"Dont ask questions just keep attacking the small stuff while ignoring the big stuff and wondering why tf a 2 week lockdown is entering its 12th month...

it is also crazy to me that people are just now talking about literally the #1 way to spread and transport disease in the most efficient and fastest way possible."
4614,"I work at an airport and we have had no restrictions, shutdowns, or closures other than people choosing not to fly."
4615,"The day before Christmas we saw roughly 100,000 people in departures and 120,000 in arrivals... yet you cant go to a stadium of several thousand to watch a game."
4616,Wtf is the difference?
4617,A nail salon cant operate because it will spread disease?
4618,Seriously?!
4619,I have been called crazy for months for saying that the only thing that absolutely should have been shutdown or severely halted was passenger travel.
4620,“You cant shutdown the airlines everything would collapse!” And “traveling on planes doesnt spread disease” (yes these are arguments I have had thrown at me frequently...) I dont want to lose my job but it makes no sense to keep the #1 vehicle for transmission open while going after small social gatherings.
4621,It’s ridiculous and this point it seems to be deliberate in its very nature.
4622,do you live in a multi-story apartment?
4623,"if so, there could be possible air ventilation issues, your air circulation getting crossed with other units in the building."
4624,I got tested with no symptoms because I was around someone who had tested positive
4625,Really?
4626,Have you heard of knock on wood as the little superstition people do so they don’t get jinxed by saying something good’s happening?
4627,Touch wood is the lazy version of that.
4628,Sometimes people even just say it rather than reaching for the nearest piece of wood to either touch or do the traditional knock.
4629,But it’s basically replaced saying knock on wood here and everyone says it.

4658,Of course that's up to the country or state they are going.

4673,Everyone in this household is fairly healthy and definitely not in the at-risk groups but why risk a disease which is spreading uncontrollably when we don’t have to...
4674,There is some lag time.
4675,I believe some hospitals are required to give the data 24-72 hours after administration and it's only the 28th and they are administered a day before their day off due to the side effects.
4676,"My mother's hospital is putting an immense effort into administering both the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines (a cousin of mine also working there as a PA, my classmate a CNA), and I'm sure they'll be on top of J&amp;J and other vaccines coming January 2021."
4677,Many of my nursing student classmates who work in the healthcare setting as techs and aids have also received and are to receive the vaccine.
4678,Well done.
4679,Give it a few extra days but going outside and outside your house is also good for you mentally so don’t stay locked inside to long.
4680,Do you think it’s better if people believe they are safe to go on with life as normal immediately after being vaccinated?
4681,Why are other people still getting on planes?

4689,Guess again.
4690,And there’s no scientist who think it’s a good idea to vaccinate younger kids yet relative to the risk they have of covid issues.
4691,But you on Reddit know better ironically saying you believe in science
4692,"People are assholes, don’t sink to their level."
4693,I think you’ll feel better at the end of the day for not participating in the spread of disease.
4694,"Besides, I wouldn’t mess around with a novel virus."
4695,"I’m healthy, 25 years old, I played sports for most of my life, I’m in shape, I eat well, been lifting weights for the last 11 years and consider myself to be in perhaps the top 10th percentile in terms of overall health and IM STILL not fucking with this virus."
4696,Better safe than sorry.
4697,"The stories of blood clots in otherwise health people, ED, lung and brain issues have seated me in well in my decision to stay the fuck away from people as much as possible."
4698,"Not to mention hearing things like people who have gotten over viruses(in the past, not COVID) but have succumbed to secondary effects like Type 1 diabetes or pneumonia."
4699,"Fuck that, all you can do is lookout for yourself and the ones you live with, fuck everybody else."
4700,I mean it’s not psychosis.
4701,Most people work where they grew up or similar.
4702,And that correlated with politics and upbringing.
4703,Healthcare workers do not really vary politically in wait way overall
4704,The positivity rate jumped 2.3% in one day.
4705,"And this jump happened on a sunday, when things are supposed to be slow"
4706,"Lol I am glad you said that, proves my point."
4707,"It’s not about racism, consider what would happen to a Chinese scientist if they expressed concerns about a vaccine versus an American scientist."
4708,"I learned that my coworker thought the flu was a stomach bug, like the 24 hour ""flu"""
4709,And mumblety-peg
4710,"Hmmm, I’ve been taking melatonin every night well before the pandemic started and I haven’t been diagnosed yet with a positive case and I’ve been tested 2x."
4711,So in my personal research melatonin has been 100% effective in preventing COVID-19.
4712,I have no medical or science background whatsoever but I must share my findings to Facebook immediately to spread the word!
4713,Laws are for poor people.
4714,[deleted]
4715,Most countries are undercounting their cases.
4716,None of the vaccines stop a person from getting the virus.
4717,How is this news?
4718,"My parents went to a family Christmas party with 25+ people a week before Christmas, attend church regularly where they don't wear masks once they sit down, and are planning to fly to Florida in January for a vacation."
4719,And they wonder why I refuse to visit them.
4720,They already do.
4721,Doctors get paid double in rural areas and it's still not enough.
4722,Facetime/Zoom/Skype is not human interaction like people seem to make it out to be.
4723,"People talk about it like it’s so great, but personally, if I miss being around somebody, video chatting them will actually make me want to be around them even more."
4724,It’s like being an alcoholic and just staring through the window outside the liquor store.
4725,"You know it’s better health-wise to not go in, but being able to look and not partake just makes it harder."
4726,"And what is ""that"" in the first sentence?"
4727,Stop your bad faith lies and provide a source for your nativist conjecture or leave me alone.
4728,Ah yeah I've had that one several times.
4729,Not fun but it's not so bad.
4730,Yup.
4731,I think it’s really interesting that we have Florida as a comparison state for the rest of us in perpetual lockdowns.
4732,"People don’t want to believe that Florida is doing fine, so they throw the “Florida is hiding their numbers” or “their wave is coming”."
4733,But like maybe it’s time to realize that society should just open.
4734,People are done with lockdowns and I think California proves that.
4735,What’s annoying about anti-vaxxers is they know the risks from getting the disease are greater than the risk from the vaccine.
4736,But they know they can rely on most of the pop to get herd immunity so they can avoid both risks themselves.
4737,I don’t believe you that you really think it’s better to get infected than get the vaccine.
4738,So you’re willing to take on the clearly demonstrated risk from COVID instead of your theoreticals about the vaccine?
4739,I don’t buy it.
4740,That’s dumb.
4741,I think you’re counting on the herd immunity.
4742,"That’s your right, but at least admit your position is self-centered."
4743,I'm just going to go out on a limb and assume every country has its own distinct covid mutation that has yet to be discovered.
4744,Until we have fully refundable/changeable tickets this will continue to happen.
4745,"Just like unpaid sick leave, people can't afford to stay home when sick."
4746,[removed]
4747,&gt; I have a good amount of money.
4748,I could repeatedly get fined and be okay.
4749,It's not a rule I have to follow.
4750,A rule whose punishment is a fine is not a rule for the wealthy.
4751,They are specifically oppressive of the poor.
4752,Correct.
4753,"Which is why fines should be scaled to income/wealth, so that poor don't get disproportionately punished, and the wealthy don't get away with just a slap on the wrist."
4754,"That said, it's not all or nothing."
4755,"If something deters 90% of people (who are not rich), that's still a 90% success rate."
4756,Most would still consider that a positive outcome.
4757,&gt; The reason we fine everybody for everything is to generate revenue.
4758,It's not to ensure safety.
4759,"I don't believe this, and I don't think you believe this either."
4760,Clearly it can be for *both* reasons.
4761,&gt; I can't believe you think fining the majority of America who is already struggling to stay economically afloat is a good idea.
4762,"No, *I'd only fine people who break the law* - which would be the minority."
4763,Very few would break the law.
4764,"In my area, the city fine you $100 for not wearing a mask, but the state doesn't allow the city to collect on that fine."
4765,Beat that.

4770,There is an invisible identity to Reddit.
4771,Anyone who goes outside of its lines is ridiculed.
4772,"Yet, no one can uphold its standards."
4773,It’s an invisible shapeless identify that is hateful and closed minded.
4774,Which is why I think it’s important to speak up.
4775,Gotten bring truth to the lions den.
4776,"There’s some kind of saying about speaking the truth.. if you don’t stand up and speak against something while you can, you may have to fight for it later."
4777,"My version of it is pretty poor, but hopefully you get the point."
4778,Curious question.
4779,Do domestic flights in the US require a covid-19 test prior flying?
4780,Exactly.
4781,i have a feeling that in a fucking pandemic governments should be allowed to strictly enforce rules.
4782,but then we are here in germany where anti maskers make one troll case at courts after another to delay rules or straight up remove them.

4787,I don’t condone violence but I think people are just sick of everyone pretending we don’t have a big fucking problem.
4788,Edit: of course also we weren’t there so who fucking knows?
4789,The great science has spoken.
4790,All hail the great science.
4791,Let the true light of the great science purge the doubters of their beastly idiocy.
4792,"There are tons of unknowns, including how long that immunity lasts from one dose versus two."
4793,"It may turn one one dose is acceptable for the non-elderly for ~3-6 months or more, or it may turn out that immunity fades quickly for all age groups."
4794,None of that takes away from the point I was making.
4795,52% is misleading.
4796,"If you remove the initial ~12 days before the immune system has adequately responded, it’s much, much higher and approaching that which is seen after the second inoculation."
4797,Probably swapped strains with each other 😬
4798,Reddit is predominantly young Europeans and Canadians.
4799,Of course they support dominating people through socialist policies.
4800,People should have been protesting against Trump to give all of us monthly checks...
4801,"Not just small towns and not just health workers- this divide has caused significant rifts in the entire country, leading to fractured and destroyed relationships as well as general resentment etc."
4802,"I don’t see this ending once the vaccine becomes readily available- how exactly does one simply move on when their neighbors, family, and friends have betrayed them in ways that significantly impacted their lives, often without consequences for their behavior?"
4803,At this point I would love to create gated communities to keep all maskholes far away from my family.
4804,They have proven themselves to be unworthy of trust or respect and I don’t want them anywhere near me.
4805,See what I mean?
4806,People who do work in healthcare often have literally been traumatized because of these losers... this isn’t going away.
4807,YOU dont care so others shouldn't either.
4808,Ok.

4830,IBD isnt a recognised exemption from the health care service.
4831,Nor is cancer.
4832,The vaccine does not contain the virus only a protien the virus uses to latch onto cells in your body.
4833,"You only feel ill a few days after becauae your body and immune system attacks the protein as if it was a virus so you may feel dizzy or have hot/cold flushes and be 'symptomatic' but being immune compromised does not mean that you can not have the vaccine, if anything you should get it ASAP to givre your system a fighting chance."

4884,I‘m from Germany.
4885,We’re currently in lockdown so no stores are open.
4886,I‘m currently an apprentice at a bookstore.
4887,All salaried workers are allowed to stay at home with 60-67% of their regular pay.
4888,They expect us (4) apprentices to somehow keep the store floating alone without having the knowledge to do so.
4889,I‘m afraid to get sick because I just can’t leave the other 3 hanging.

4894,50%
4895,Have you listened at all to the right?
4896,There's already radicals everywhere and they are simply just being ASKED to wear a mask.
4897,"If you’re immune compromised, you can still go out in public."

4899,Take people with IBD that take immune suppressant medication.
4900,Take people with cancer.
4901,Not every medical case can afford to stay indoors 100% of the time.
4902,&gt; I'm going to take a guess and say that funneling money into the government from the people that are 6 months overdue in rent isn't a good idea.
4903,You say this as though they're forcing it from the hands of the poor.
4904,It's a fine.
4905,"If you can't afford to pay it, then follow the rules."
4906,"Certain rules are oppressive, sure, but something like wearing a seatbelt, or wearing a mask, is not."
4907,The result of a fine won't be a ton of money going from poor people to the government.
4908,"The result will be people following the rules, and almost no one paying the fine (because it's a meaningful deterrent)."
4909,&gt; I could stop wearing a seatbelt for at least a year without getting caught.
4910,"But despite this, people still wear seatbelts for fear of getting fined, even if the chances are rare."

5048,i work slightly above minimum wage in a kitchen at a nursing home.
5049,i've been there since JUST before the pandemic hit in my area and have watched the covid wave wash over us and take far too many lives.
5050,"for my facility it was just residents that lost their lives, but several of the staff have had **very** severe covid, a few are long term covid patients and are still on ventilators."
5051,"i was somehow lucky enough to be one of the 10% of our building to not get infected, and just today got vaccinated."
5052,"even after everything some of my coworkers who still haven't had it either are downplaying covid completely, and have been shaming me for wanting the vaccine so badly."

5143,I get the impression that they were way to ambitious with their trial design and got lost in the complexity of it.
5144,BioNtech/Pfizer was way more straightforward and seemed to be designed for approval only.

5148,"I’m not American so maybe I’m missing something but I wasn’t entirely sure what point you were making either 😅 (likely more my fault than yours)

But i do think this problem of distrust isn’t universal, and the distrust is merely a symptom of other societal issues."
5149,"There are likely multiple ways of fixing this, the first is dramatically lift the standards of living for every one (sounds easy enough...), or possibly introduce a legally protected mechanism that makes transparency a systematic default &amp; it should be provable to a lay man that things are transparent (how do that isn’t clear)."
5150,There would have to be limits like anything relating to national security but you would have stop ppl from abusing that as a loophole to by pass national scrutiny.
5151,"So to elaborate on my earlier comment, I believe distrust is why it won’t work, but the general public isn’t to blame for this."
5152,"It’s a symptom of a number of things, like polarisation, transparency, track record, etc."
5153,Unsurprisingly trust shouldn’t be a given but it’s a very favourable position for a government to be in.
5154,"There are countries where people really trust the government like Singapore, possibly it’s because people like Lee Kuan Yew dramatically improved the standards of living for everyone after WW2."
5155,They also score 4/180 on transparency international’s corruption perception index.
5156,I’m not Singaporean (I’m Australian) but all my Singaporean friends take a lot of pride in their country &amp; the are very grateful for their government.

5172,"Sorry, but this is utterly absurd."
5173,The only logical rationale why a church is still operating in person is because of donations.
5174,These churches are literally saying risk your health and the health of others to come give us tax free money.

5195,"My broadband is known for inaccuracies, poor reporting and censorship."
5196,The reasons people in my family have flown this pandemic.
5197,We live on a small island and have no other way to travel.
5198,1.
5199,My mother's father was ill in hospital (not related to Covid) and my grandmother was living alone and struggling.
5200,"She flew a few times back and forth during the year to support her (although flying out to her only when Covid cases were low here)

2."
5201,Me and my sister flew separately at a time when our island had next to no Covid cases to go and see our mother &amp; grandmother.
5202,3.
5203,"I had to go to university, which was open."
5204,"Therefore I had to fly (although we actually took a ferry there, my dad flew and I came back at the end of term by plane (and had to isolate on return))."
5205,4.
5206,"My grandfather died and there was a funeral, so my dad and my sister had to fly to get there."
5207,There are other valid reasons people need to fly or use medium/long distance public transport.
5208,"For example for surgery they can't get here, so need to travel to get it, essential workers need to travel in and out of longer distances."
5209,That doesn't mean we need to pay taxpayer money during a financial crisis in order to charter private jets for them.
5210,They may not need an air ambulance for their medical needs.
5211,Just because not everyone fits into your situation (which I imagine is some form of larger US city).
5212,You're excluding other people's lived experiences that don't match up with your own and saying their morally wrong on the basis of that.
5213,Only the US really counts in that figure.
5214,The other locations would be much easier to cover.
5215,Not that Canada doesn't need to get its shit together.
5216,You think shaming someone for not wearing a mask during a global pandemic is a *bad* thing?
5217,GTFO with that shit.
5218,Wear a mask or stay the fuck home.
5219,If you go out without one you deserve more than having your feelings hurt.
5220,Let’s just jail everyone for anything at all that could negatively effect someone.

5229,"&gt;Dozens of research papers published over the past few months have found that people whose bodies were teeming with the coronavirus more often became seriously ill and were more likely to die, compared with those who carried much less virus and were more likely to emerge relatively unscathed."
5230,&gt;Now that information could help hospitals.
5231,"&gt;The results suggest that knowing the so-called viral load — the amount of virus in the body — could help doctors distinguish those who may need an oxygen check just once a day, for example, from those who need to be monitored more closely, said Dr. Daniel Griffin, an infectious disease physician at Columbia University in New York."
5232,"&gt;Tracking viral loads “can actually help us stratify risk,” Dr. Griffin said."
5233,"The idea is not new: Managing viral load has long formed the basis of care for people with H.I.V., for example, and for tamping down transmission of that virus."
5234,&gt;Little effort has been made to track viral loads in Covid-19 patients.
5235,"This month, however, the Food and Drug Administration said clinical labs might report not just whether a person is infected with the coronavirus, but also an estimate of how much virus is in their body."
5236,&gt;This is not a change in policy.
5237,"Labs could have reported this information all along, according to two senior F.D.A."
5238,officials who spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly about the matter.
5239,"&gt;Still, the news came as a welcome surprise to some experts, who have for months pushed labs to record this information."
5240,"&gt;”This is a very important move by the F.D.A.,” said Dr. Michael Mina, an epidemiologist at the Harvard T.H."
5241,Chan School of Public Health.
5242,"“I think it’s a step in the right direction to making the most use of one of the only pieces of data we have for many positive individuals.”

&gt;The F.D.A.’s change followed a similar move by the Florida Department of Health, which now requires all labs to report this information."
5243,"The omission of viral load from test results was a missed opportunity not just to optimize strained clinical resources, but also to better understand Covid-19, experts said."
5244,"Analyzing the viral load soon after exposure, for example, could help reveal whether people who die from Covid-19 are more likely to have high viral loads at the start of their illnesses."
5245,"&gt;And a study published in June showed that the viral load decreases as the immune response surges, “just like you’d expect it to be for any old virus,” said Dr. Alex Greninger, a virologist at the University of Washington in Seattle, who led the study."
5246,&gt;An uptick in the average viral load throughout entire communities could indicate an epidemic on the rise.
5247,"“We can get an idea of whether the epidemic is growing or declining, without relying on case counts,” said James Hay, a postdoctoral researcher in Dr. Mina’s lab."

5298,"Then I remembered polio vaccines are either inactivated polio (dead) or a weakened version of the virus, which can actually mutate and cause disease."
5299,"It's a small risk, but non-zero."
5300,"So I checked (the news)[https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2020/sep/02/vaccine-derived-polio-spreads-in-africa-after-defeat-of-wild-virus], and fuck me, he's right."
5301,"Trump looks up to Kim Jong un, this is definitely not reciprocal."
5302,The IFR of Covid is for most countries below 1 percent.
5303,"It varies widely by country, from .09 percent in Kenya, with its young population, and 1.09 percent in Japan, with its unusually elderly population."
5304,"You must be talking about CFR, not IFR."
5305,CFR is less useful because it depends highly on how many cases get confirmed out of the total amount of infections.
5306,"In the US, estimates of the infection to confirmed case ratio are between 3:1 and 20:1."
5307,"Although 20:1 is too high we know now, the study came out in September."
5308,"I realize that now, and the honest truth is that going into it, I didn't know what he thought."

5319,They didn’t implicitly assert being on a ventilator is a guarantee.
5320,You seem to have pulled that impression out of thin air and others do not share it with you.
5321,"You’re a weird conspiracy nut so I know this is pointless, but come on, it’s pretty laughable that you just tried to compare side effects of the vaccines and side effects of the disease."
5322,"As if *somehow* soreness and swelling can ever be considered worse than blood clots, internal organ damage, loss of sensation, hypoxia, and death."
5323,It doesn’t matter that 30% of people are asymptomatic.
5324,"It matters that many people WILL become symptomatic, and most symptomatic people gain not only short-term but seemingly long-term health consequences ranging from mild breathlessness to major heart arrhythmia, and many other issues in between."
5325,And that’s of course for the people who don’t die.

5327,Get vaccinated.
5328,"My sister's best friend's mom died 2 nights ago in Ohio, she had been doing zoom church services but they decided to hold an in person service for good friday."

5331,She was the sole carer for 6 grandkids.
5332,She was on a vent and when they did a trach and tried to wean her off sedatives she didn't wake up.
5333,Looks like she stroked out while on the vent.

\&gt; This analysis suggests that patients whose samples exhibit the S-dropout profile in the TaqPath test are more likely to have high viral loads at the time of sampling."
5468,The relevance of this to epidemiological reports of fast spread of the SARS-CoV-2 in regions of the UK is discussed.
5469,"&amp;#x200B;

5655,I got covid from a person in my house who has been isolated in a separate room since symptom onset.
5656,"Said person has a much more severe case than I do symptom wise, maybe in part due to a higher initial viral load."
5657,"Now that we're both positive, is there any reason to keep them isolated?"

5708,So china's approach towards covid works and it's not wrong to praise that approach.
5709,The WHO isn't a credible source.
5710,They originally told us that covid wasn't transmisable person to person and that wearing a mask would not provide adequate protection in the beginning.
5711,Look at us now.

5722,I mean.
5723,"There has been zero outbreaks, gyms are as big as Walmart and can only have 20 people in them at a time, masks are required, and there’s sanitizer stations every 20 feet to wipe everything down."
5724,Walmart and malls can have hundreds of people in them or something.
5725,There was 50 people allowed when they opened them back up in July but they took that away for basically no reason.
5726,Because as I said there have been 0 outbreaks at a gym this whole time.
5727,I really wish they would ease the restrictions on the gym until proven otherwise.
5728,Doesn’t need to be at full capacity but 50 at time was working pretty well.
5729,Then they dropped it to 10 then back up to 20 on unfounded information that the gym was a problem.
5730,"It’s bars, schools and family gatherings those are the real issues."
5731,I thought gyms were going to be a shit show for covid myself but they haven’t been at all.
5732,Wish we could look at the data and adjust the gym capacities to a reasonable number.
5733,I have to schedule 48 hours in advance on the second or else I won’t get in at the time I need.
5734,There has been outbreaks at classes like Pilates and spin class and stuff.
5735,But there’s a big difference in the size of space in a commercial gym and a spin class.
5736,Keeping up this level of production already leads to spread
5737,He’s pumping droplets all over the place.
5738,"We'll see if you'll have the same attitude when it's African-American churches refusing to close, or African-American people refusing to get the vaccine."
5739,Something tells me you'll have no issue defending those decisions.
5740,"important things to keep in mind  

1 - most expecially aged 40-60 don't know their actual health state is."
5741,i might be one day away from having a stroke and i think i'm in 100% health.
5742,"2 - death it's not the only thing to care about, i'm more scared about long term consequences than actually dying."
5743,"3 - death is not the only thing to keep in mind, a virus that has 0 mortality but sends to hospital double the people covid does for a longer time would be more dangerous for the society than covid."
5744,So the fact that few people die under 60 it's not an excuse for them to do the fuck they want.
5745,You would be shocked a how many people stock up on alcohol instead of buying food or paying their bills for January.
5746,Folks were literally buying boxes and crates of alcohol yesterday.

5751,"Even Spain who had one of the hardest lockdowns in Europe only got their reproduction number down to 0.6 or something like that, and that was with the help of the spring and summer arriving."
5752,That means that you're not even halving the case numbers for each generation.
5753,Complete eradication is completely impossible for any european country at this point without the help of vaccinations.
5754,They would have to lockdown for half a year and people would literally revolt.

5765,"Yeah, I don't even have to read past the first paragraph to know that it's pure fantasy."
5766,All that widespread seroprevalence indicates is that the infection is more widespread and less lethal than case mortality stats indicate.
5767,"NYC seroprevalence was something like 25%, with 25k deaths and potentially double that when counting probales and accounting for statistical fuckery."
5768,Wuhan seroprevalence according to your article was 4.4% with \~3k official deaths.
5769,These cities are roughly comparable in size as are their death rates.
5770,"At most you are looking at a doubling or tripling of the official death count, so your 10-14x assessment is PURE FANTASY."

5772,You are assuming every developing country is just a pile of rocks?
5773,"The ignorance BLEEDS from your tone, step out of your little bubble :)."
5774,Lil Pump is like the human form of a yeast infection.
5775,I read the article and it’s awful.
5776,It doesn’t make any sense.
5777,It says something like many government have imposed masks hence masks are the New normal after the pandemics.
5778,No logic.
5779,Really?
5780,"When it's over, can we start fining people who wear masks and socially distance?"
5781,Or is it only your rules that take priority?
5782,The medical industry has been shipping allograft in temperature sensitive boxes for years.
5783,This isn’t a new issue and it’s been mostly figured out prior to this
5784,Oh for real?
5785,Then I guess I just saw it over the last few weeks.
5786,Still-they do run higher than Hopkins and have the whole Pandemic so I’m still wondering if they are quicker or over counting
5787,👏
5788,Pineapple beer.
5789,Shops weren't exactly telling us how to do it but the did have convenient displays with all the ingredients.
5790,Yea the numbers for this week and next week are probably gonna be pretty erratic in terms of reporting thanks to holidays.
5791,We might not have a clear picture of where we're at until late next week.
5792,"It's no surprise that Russia understated its Covid deaths any more than it was a surprise that, days after one vaccine was reported as ""90% effective"" their unproven vaccine was suddenly declared ""92% effective""."
5793,They are full of s\*\*t.
5794,Oh there went my hope for a nice summer.
5795,EU should never have declined Pfizer to produce extra doses.
5796,It should not be mandatory after the pandemic is well under control and most population has been vaccinated.
5797,"However, I think wearing a mask habit should not be frowned upon and our western society should view it as normal for those who choose to wear them."
5798,"Before the pandemic if you wore a mask in public, you'd get that look from others thinking you're some sort of a germaphobe freak."
5799,2 million at the very beginning is still nothing to scoff at.
5800,But it needs to be 10+ million a month to have a chance of curbing the epidemic in 2021.
5801,Since that service we definitely are stating to figure out some different options.
5802,That kind of comment would make someone like my mother decide she needed to go in person.
5803,You can literally see a doctor at any time - we don't have lions walking in the streets...
5804,"Yes, public sector health is a gamble, but anyone can go to the clinic to see a doctor, or go to the ER after hours, even if you wait."
5805,And if you have private healthcare you are fine.
5806,I have been in state hospitals on a Saturday night / holidays.
5807,"It's literally 90% alcohol-related trauma - stabbings, MVA's, domestic violence."
5808,"Severe withdrawal (ie seizures, delirium, high blood pressure) is not very common and most people can recover with out-patient treatment like mild sedatives and symptomatic support."
5809,"Certainly, the amount of alcohol-related admissions that are prevented, are much more than the additional admissions for (relatively rare) severe withdrawal."
5810,Socializing and interacting with others only on a glowing screen just doesn't cut it.
5811,"Humans are social creatures, and what people are being expected to do - isolate from in-person social interaction for what will likely be 15-18 months - is not good for mental health."
5812,Video chat was and is mentally taxing for me because it's not the same as actually being around other people.
5813,It's not a real interaction.
5814,&gt; countries that still refuse to do so are now lying more than Russia.
5815,"Well I wouldn't know about *more*, but I fully agree there are probably more countries under-reporting and in the long run excess deaths is the only reliable statistic."
5816,"Still, even when counting excess deaths we will never know how much people died of *Covid* exactly, only how much more people died compared to other years."
5817,"Other deaths like those from Influenza are way down, for example."
5818,in poland?
5819,you’ll see them all without masks... same reason they allow half face shields as masks.
5820,"total ignorance with no international consultation... look at the prime minister, he went to brussels in a smog mask with open vents...

5821,Today and tomorrow will be interesting days in the usa data wise.
5822,You would assume there will be some holiday catch up but things were starting to look like we might be turning a corner around December 15th.
5823,I'd say anything better than 3300 deaths would be a positive sign.
5824,Why are you ignoring the credit card transaction analysis I linked?
5825,"Pubs, clubs and bars are not the economy, but the way poor people spend their disposable income."
5826,"You are wrong on hospital beds, of course."
5827,I wrote exactly why you are wrong.
5828,Why do you try to deceive like this?
5829,"The lethality of this disease may be globally low, because of Africa and other countries."
5830,The WHO analysis by Ioannidis is bullshit per its non-curation even of small-number studies like Streeck's.
5831,Applying a median in an I^2 range like admitted by Ioannidis is still having bad weighing.
5832,The IFR for first-world countries is in the 1% range.
5833,Why do you try to apply world numbers to countries with a radically different age distribution?
5834,That is definitely an issue.
5835,Difficult to not give people some warning but by doing so it increases people’s movements prior to lockdowns starting.
5836,Basically what portland William said...
5837,"They admit it openly now, on BBC news each night it says at the bottom 'deaths for any reason within 28 days of a positive test'"
5838,"Yes, there is no guarantee that someone with covid will be on a ventilator (obviously), and no guarantee there will be side effects for someone who gets a vaccine."
5839,"I was never saying there was, I was only disputing that I interpreted the original commenter as suggesting such."
5840,"It seems you do not interpret that as such, it is seems rather subjective, but I perceived it as such, with logical reasoning behind it

&gt;It’s very disingenuous that you would start this conversation with an irrelevant statistic about asymptomatic cases and continue to act as if you are well-informed on the topic of COVID

I gave a statistic, which shows that I am informed on the topic on COVID."
5841,"Just because you perceive it as irrelevant, is well.. irrelevant."
5842,"It was not disingenuous, and it was directly related to the point the previous commenter made."
5843,Can you elaborate on why you perceive it to be disingenuous?
5844,"&gt;And you’re claiming you didn’t understand because you were forced to interpret the sentence a specific way based on grammatical structure

I did not claim that I didn't understand."
5845,"Only now am I saying that I will give you the benefit of the doubt that you perceive it as being something other than how I perceived it, but there was logical basis behind my reasoning...

&gt;Grammatical prescriptivism isn’t an excuse to not understand something with plenty of context."
5846,"There was not much context, and of the context that there was, the original commenter was implying that it's either a ventilator or side effects."
5847,"Let's re-read the sentence since you are contesting this point:

""I have only this to say on people complaining about mild side effects like itching or pain on the injection site.. Really?"
5848,Is it so bad?
5849,"Would you rather prefer a ventilator?"""
5850,"""mild side effects like itching or pain on the injection site"" \[OR\] ""Would you **RATHER** **PREFER** a ventilator?"""
5851,Can you explain how that is not a presenting a dichotomy?
5852,Is the \[OR\] not implicit?
5853,"If not, can you explain how you see it as not?"
5854,&gt;That’s why your medical decision is my business.
5855,"This isn’t your colon acting up, it’s an infectious disease that has affected literally the entire world."
5856,And vaccines literally require most of the population to opt in for herd immunity to take effect.
5857,Your decision will affect others.
5858,It is not and cannot be private or ignored or overlooked.
5859,"See, this is where you are incorrect, at least as it relates to the vaccine."
5860,"This is because, as the WHO and other extremely credible sources point out, they don't know if the vaccine can prevent transmission."
5861,"Here are some sources that explain this:

[https://www.nytimes.com/2020/12/08/health/covid-vaccine-mask.html](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/12/08/health/covid-vaccine-mask.html) \- ""“A lot of people are thinking that once they get vaccinated, they’re not going to have to wear masks anymore,” said Michal Tal, an immunologist at Stanford University."
5862,"“It’s really going to be critical for them to know if they have to keep wearing masks, because they could still be contagious.”""

[https://www.axios.com/who-covid-19-vaccines-travel-quarantine-429bfd14-0439-4a08-aecd-fc89dc70c568.html](https://www.axios.com/who-covid-19-vaccines-travel-quarantine-429bfd14-0439-4a08-aecd-fc89dc70c568.html) \- ""Swaminathan was asked whether international travel without quarantine would be possible after mass coronavirus vaccinations."
5863,"""I don't believe we have the evidence on any of the vaccines to be confident that it's going to prevent people from actually getting the infection and therefore being able to pass it on,"" she said."""
5864,"On the issue of vaccines, you are factually incorrect."
5865,"If you want to make the argument about wearing masks and social distancing to reduce transmission, then you are correct, but since we are discussing vaccines, you would be incorrect on this point, and I have shown that with the most credible evidence available."
5866,"Do you dispute this point, are you going to spread misinformation by purporting that the covid vaccines have been proven to prevent transmission?"
5867,"&gt;Also, not knowing if the vaccine will 100% work is a bad reason not to take it."
5868,Just take it.
5869,"If it doesn’t work, no loss

This is also factually incorrect again."
5870,"There is potential loss from taking the vaccine, such as if there would be an allergic reaction or other reason that could cause adverse reactions from the vaccine."
5871,"From the CDC's own website: 

[https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/safety/allergic-reaction.html](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/safety/allergic-reaction.html) \- ""CDC has learned of reports that some people have experienced severe allergic reactions—also known as anaphylaxis—after getting a COVID-19 vaccine."
5872,"As an example, an allergic reaction is considered severe when a person needs to be treated with epinephrine or EpiPen© or if they must go to the hospital."""
5873,"[https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/covid-19/info-by-product/pfizer/reactogenicity.html](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/covid-19/info-by-product/pfizer/reactogenicity.html) \- Many ""severe"" reactions

Are you suggesting that a ""severe"" reaction cause by any of the side effects or allergic reaction is ""no loss""?"
5874,"By the way, thank you for editing you last comment, and I am enjoying this honest, intellectual, and fruitful discussion!"
5875,His whole family is paying the price.
5876,So sick of these stupid selfish people who only give a damn when it affects them personally.
5877,Piss off.
5878,"For me opposite, I always take a long ass nap after that"
5879,You are not 30% of the population though are you?
5880,Which was the original premise?
5881,"What is the population incidence of type 1 diabetes (and I stated type 2 in my post above) and why is a government support package for individuals such as yourself to remain at home not preferable to paying 80% of salaries for everyone furloughed across the U.K, the vast majority of those in the healthy under 60 category?"
5882,I’m not shaming anyone.
5883,"Bottom line, if you want to maintain a life limiting BMI that’s people’s personal choice."
5884,"But that choice shouldn’t then be used to justify widespread poverty, joblessness and destruction of people’s futures though Covid restrictions."
5885,The disease is endemic.
5886,It isn’t going anywhere.
5887,All we are doing is delaying the inevitable.
5888,"As soon as vaccines are rolled out, restrictions need to end."
5889,"If geriatrics refuse the vaccine, that again is their choice."
5890,But that shouldn’t be then allowed to justify future restrictions for the rest of us.
5891,Where is the splitting?
5892,"Just as many countries require a negative test to enter, so many will require proof of vaccination in the future."
5893,It's simply a sensible form of protection of society as a whole.
5894,"If ya'll quit tomorrow, I wouldn't see any problem with it."
5895,Doctors and nurses deserve better than the way the country has been treating this.
5896,"&gt;They have not even filed an application with us yet”, Wathion said in an interview with Belgian newspaper Het Nieuwsblad published on Tuesday."
5897,"&gt;European regulators have only received some information about the vaccine, Wathion said."
5898,"&gt;”Not even enough to warrant a conditional marketing licence”, he said."
5899,“We need additional data about the quality of the vaccine.
5900,"And after that, the company has to formally apply.”

&gt;This made it “improbable” that an approval could already be granted next month, Wathion said."
5901,[removed]
5902,Well that’s just great isn’t it.
5903,Not like we’re in any hurry or anything while the dead are piling up

5921,how are the haredi/orthodox community reacting to the vaccine?
5922,i have heard they are quite problematic for the pandemic response there due to refusing gathering limits
5923,But why do we have higher cases of the covid if we have been practicing social distancing and mask wearing like the government says?
5924,Seems to be a bunch of b.s to me.
5925,I don’t really get why we went from 2-3 months to 1 year + when the mortality rate is lower than initially thought.
5926,I understand it’s much more infectious but the reality is that no one would have thought the economic and mental/social sacrifice of an entire year is worth it.

5949,"Yours involved a certain fear of immediate/imminent bodily harm (""Oh my God, I'm going to die!"

5984,"He talks about how people out there don't give a fuck about their health, they will smoke, eat, and drink themselves to an early death."
5985,He says he gets patients who refuse to wear a mask in the hospital everyday.

5992,Americans really have a one view of the world!
5993,It is a fine or up to 6 months in jail.

5996,"In 99.99% of all cases you won't be going to jail because you will be fined, if you are the 0.01% who end up in jail you will likely be out in a month given we have been releasing non-violent offenders during covid to reduce numbers in prison."

6079,Reminds me of the cruise study the cruise lines did.
6080,Within 36 hours of the first cruise someone tested positive.
6081,"&gt;AMSTERDAM (Reuters) - The number of deaths in the Netherlands increased at the highest rate since World War Two this year due to the coronavirus pandemic, the Dutch national statistics office (CBS) said on Tuesday."
6082,"A total of 770,400 people in the Netherlands have tested positive for COVID-19 since the start of the pandemic."
6083,"The actual number of infections and fatalities is likely to be significantly higher, as a shortage of testing and lab capacity meant only seriously ill patients were tested during the first months of the pandemic."
6084,"I was living in Argentina and got the vaccine to travel to Thailand, and it as enforced in Bangkok, mandatory airport quarantine if you didn't had it, airline would not allow you to board in Argentina anyway."
6085,Reasoning?

6090,It should be optional but encouraged.
6091,He’s not an epidemiologist.
6092,He’s extrapolating herd immunity from R0.
6093,It’s a naive estimate.
6094,The new variant’s increased transmissibility is very hard to gauge and has dropped since they announced it as a cause for concern.
6095,It may drop again.
6096,We did not just go from herd immunity reached at 60% to 80%.
6097,This is speculation based on the naive estimate.
6098,&gt;	• It also means a delay in herd immunity from vaccines.
6099,"If a country with 10% of the pop recovered expected to vaccinate 5% of the population per month, immunity would be reached in ~ September."
6100,Now it would take until ~Dec 2021-Jan 2022.
6101,Good thing the US has the capability to vaccinate 50% of its population each flu season so doing more than 5% each month is going to be a cakewalk.
6102,Obviously this is an unprecedented situation and the scope of it is massive.
6103,But the nuts and bolts of giving shots is not the issue.
6104,It’s a vaccine creation issue.
6105,Absolutely no way it would take till December to vaccinate the public when we do 50% in less than 6 months as is.
6106,The “math” doesn’t add up.
6107,&gt;	• Some vaccines might become nearly useless.
6108,A vaccine with 70% effectiveness (Eg Oxford) could have been useful if we only needed 60% of the pop to be immune.
6109,"But if we need 75%, even if we vaccinated 100% (impossible) it might still not stop the epidemic."
6110,Hilariously unscientific (or sad I dunno) and I’ll let someone smarter than me explain in more detail why more transmissibility doesn’t mean that people will be less protected by a vaccine in any large way.
6111,&gt;I don’t see how their death rates could be so uniquely lower than most people but “severe covid” is more common.
6112,The average healthcare worker is healthier (younger and less obese) and practices more prophylactic measures (ex.
6113,"mask wearing) than the average patient who is hospitalized for COVID, hence why it is ""only"" 2.9K deaths out of 18 million."
6114,"They are, however, more susceptible to severe COVID by nature of their work conditions."
6115,"**In other words, while their healthier status and behaviors almost certainly guarantees them better odds at survival if they get a severe case, their working conditions increase the risk of them getting a severe case in the first place."

6126,I live in major metropolitan area with a rate half that of the shithole one horse town I was born in.
6127,"Gee, I wonder why."
6128,Could possibly be because of braindead morons like you.
6129,2-3 month pause possibly came from the long trial pause in the USA.

6131,I dread to think of how that number is going to explode when the delayed boom from Christmas starts hitting.
6132,I guess we'll know in about 5-10 days?
6133,I wish they would do this in the US.
6134,"From what I understand, you might be able to, but you might not."
6135,"AFAIK, that study hasn't been done yet."
6136,"Yes, the Western media has never discriminated against China, the Chinese
China is treated as one of your main imaginary enemies, Chinese companies are blocked by you, Chinese students are deported by you, researchers are arrested by you, many people are abused and even beaten in the street just because they are of Chinese descent, because of a disease from nature COVID-19

6166,"This doesn't mean there won't be another spike, but your area's uncontrollable end will stop eventually."

6169,Define stop the virus.
6170,"Every person vaccinated is a person who is extremely unlikely to develop any kind of severe illness, and very likely a person who won't be able to spread as well, or even spread at all."
6171,"We'll probably need anywhere between 70-90% (the second number is a far away upper bound) of people vaccinated to get herd immunity, where you can have everything open as it was in 2019 and not have case growth."
6172,That doesn't mean you won't see an impact beforehand though.
6173,"Once all at-risk people are vaccinated, we'll almost certainly see a pretty dramatic drop in hospitalizations and especially deaths."
6174,That could be considered stopping the virus.
6175,"Even if only 50% of people get vaccinated, let's say even 33%, that's all the more people who, if not dead ends, are reallllyyy narrow alleys for the virus to continue spreading."
6176,"That will have a significant effect on cases for sure, and will allow for more stuff to be open."
6177,As for opening stuff and goalposts- it definitely feels like the goalposts are being shifted sometimes lol.
6178,"At the same time, what kind of official?"
6179,"Some public health officials and epidemiologists may want absolutely zero spread, but, uh, to put it gently, they're not in the driver's seat."
6180,Restrictions are currently in place as much because they're politically popular as they are because they're useful from a public health perspective.
6181,"If you're in the US, think about the restrictions that the government says are in place in comparison with what's actually happening."
6182,"This sub likes to harp a lot about how people, let's say in Southern California are still going to malls, holding private gatherings and the like despite stay at home orders."
6183,"While most people are definitely obeying restrictions at least some of the time, a lot of people aren't, and the people who are obeying aren't doing so out of some great respect for the government but out of concern for their own and others' safety."
6184,"Vaccination will make people feel safe, and once people see hospitalizations go down and stay down, that popular support for and actual obedience of restrictions will also go down- and the politicians who have the power to create and enforce restrictions will follow public opinion, you can bet on that."
6185,Most governments are going to follow the money.
6186,"If they find, whether on their own or by looking at others, that they can have 100% economic activity without endangering hospital capacity or too many lives, they'll take the option that has 100% economic activity- it wouldn't make sense to be closed down while everyone else isn't."

6201,"""By the end of December, we expect to have about 40 million doses of the [Pfizer and Moderna] vaccines available for distribution,"" Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar said last month."
6202,"""Enough to vaccinate 20 million of our most vulnerable Americans."""
6203,How much does your asshole owe?
6204,I’m a female
6205,"Well originally it was 20 million immunizations by year end, based on quotes from Dr. Moncef Slaoui."
6206,"However when you parse the statements that were made it looks like the Warp Speed officials only promised 20 million doses distributed, not administered."
6207,I guess distribution is their part of the problem but not administration.
6208,In any event it sounds like the doses were manufactured but not successfully distributed.
6209,"On one hand this is probably challenging, on the other hand they've had months to prepare."
6210,"And with basically unlimited resources they could use any brute force technique they wanted, having hundreds of trucks or planes or whatever standing by."
6211,1918 flu only killed as many as it did due to the hygiene and conditions of the time period and no antibiotics.
6212,The IFR was something like 2%.
6213,Most that died did so of secondary bacterial pneumonia.
6214,If it had happened later it would have had a much lower IFR.
6215,More like 100 or even a 1000 times.
6216,Right behind Arizona with 12%
6217,I have a feeling I’ve heard something like this before but it’s been so long I’ve forgotten what the whole meme was about.
6218,"But they didn't have enough for all of them, they had to spend time deciding which healthcare workers got it."
6219,Then which LTC residents.
6220,"Oh, then some very important campaign contributors wanted to get it too."
6221,I specifically declined to comment on truthfulness - very few governments have been truthful during this pandemic.
6222,"However, the data suggests that China has provided numbers approximately as accurate as any other nation which suffered a spring/early summer wave."
6223,"That's a good achievement, but WV is also a tiny, tiny state by population."
6224,Just LA County is many times larger by population.
6225,Houston is larger by population.
6226,"Not to discount what they are doing, but things don't always scale so easily with logistics."
6227,"Or order themselves a latte from the barista in Woolworths and walk around the shop sipping it with their mask in their hand, that seems to he a popular excuse to not wear one's mask in these parts"
6228,Faucci qualified his claim the other day as saying it was a moving target - that no one really knows.
6229,Storage was a big issue for one of them.
6230,The retail chains generally don't have a -100F freezer lying around; only hospitals and labs have those.
6231,"However, there was a brief discussion of using the Dippin' Dots ice cream dispensers as a last resort because they have freezers capable of -200F."
6232,"Yeah, sorry, maybe lockdown is the wrong word."
6233,I'm just against letting is spread completely uncontrolled once the most vulnerable are protected.
6234,I agree
6235,Should be oro-nasal.
6236,We don’t need any dick nosing Swedes
6237,Vaccine data on efficacy still seems iffy to me.
6238,"Not a statistician, but just because 150ish people in the placebo group and 10ish in the vaccinated group were infected out of 22K in each group in such a short timeframe, doesn’t tell me that the vaccine is any good."
6239,Just my layman 2c
6240,"Most of Colorado, yes."
6241,"Colorado Springs, 3 military bases, home to New Life Church and Focus on the Family, and an attitude that borders on narcissism."
6242,"Yeah, we don't do what the rest of Colorado does."
6243,"I can't even buy weed here, have to go to another town cuz it's still illegal in the city so all the military boys don't get in trouble."
6244,The top comment on this thread is about how this was about manufactored doses not people dosed and the next one was about how 2 million is still not something to scoff at.
6245,I feel like those are both good top comments.
6246,Either way I removed this thread for being pointless clickbait.
6247,"""Why do Republicans get this more than Democrats?"
6248,"It's obviously a conspiracy!"""
6249,Also their doctors are increasingly foreign born due to the visa program that allows them to stay if they practice in areas with severe doctor shortages.
6250,"One shot produced antibodies in most people, two in nearly all."
6251,Even one shot would drastically change the course of the pandemic for the better.
6252,"I’m not scandalized that a very elderly politician who has taken the virus very seriously, needs to come in contact with people to do his job, is well known for wearing masks and precautions, and also seems pretty frail got vaccinated."
6253,It’s not like you’re talking about Marco Rubio here.
6254,Get out with that both sides BS.
6255,"The US is not way ahead of where anyone thought they'd be, _at all._"
6256,"There’s been over 4,000 new strains, actually."
6257,"The media seems to enjoy the drama of them, but the likelihood of one becoming a world-ended is near zero."
6258,"The but the best way I’ve heard them described is “If Bob changes his coat, he looks different, but he’s still Bob.”"
6259,I prefer if masks become a courtesy thing after the pandemic.
6260,"“Not feeling well but still need to go out, wear a mask”"
6261,But... this is not about US?
6262,Can you like stop being so US-centric for 2 minutes?
6263,Can you try that?
6264,Not everything is about you or revolves around you lot.
6265,"I’m not sure why you’re asking me that, I never made that claim."
6266,"Yes, you are right."
6267,I also looked it up based on the questions.
6268,I had not paid so much attention to the details as I am in neither category.
6269,"We received a call from the County Executive who described all the phases, so I just remembered that population which will eventually get it."
6270,Uh.
6271,How about today?
6272,Explain how they make his statement correct.
6273,I think people should 100% wear them if they are sick and have a cold/flu once this is over.
6274,"Stop coming into work and wear a damn mask to stop speeding your germs if you do go out, it’s not hard."
6275,"It’s actually unclear how
Much the US is sitting on because our reporting is so far behind."
6276,"We have definitely administered more than 2 million, but no one knows yet how many more"
6277,Source for most scientist believe it’s 70%?
6278,I sure hope it's not like testing.
6279,And that's human nature - youre not ever going to get 100% of people to comply with anything.
6280,Experts know this.
6281,"That's why ""if everyone locked down fully for two weeks this would've been over!"""
6282,Is not sound policy.
6283,Neither is abstinence only sex education.
6284,"But your argument is ""turn off the news for a month""."
6285,So staying uneducated will make you happy?
6286,Trump is too busy complaining about the Election loss and Golfing to even know what is going on...

6297,"Gyms, churches, basically everything else is open, and I’m sure people attend private gatherings all the time."
6298,"Unless there was a cash incentive for everyone to stay home, people won’t do it."
6299,"Not just talking about unemployment money, people who have a stable income still need an incentive of extra money to stay home, even if it’s going to “unnecessary” fun things like new phones, computers, game consoles, or a vacation fund for after COVID, etc."
6300,"Maybe $1,000-$2,500 a month and stricter enforcement will work."

6302,"This helps both people who lost their job stay afloat in quarantine, while also providing an incentive for financially well off households to stay home, wear a mask, and follow whatever gathering guidelines are in place."
6303,"Either provide cash incentives for everyone, including well off households to stay home, or provide safer outdoor gathering spaces to at least reduce the spread compared to indoor gatherings."
6304,A lot of people won’t stay home to be “a hero” or to be “selfless”.

6311,Nah no lies going on there at all...
6312,Remember there are delays to any input.
6313,They locked down because things were getting out of hand.
6314,They did not lock down to make things get out of hand.
6315,I think we need to get the production up in order to get the vaccination number up.
6316,I think the roll out is going to be slow until there is enough to administer to anyone without checking where they fall in the priority list.
6317,This virus had mutated thousands of times in the last year.
6318,You are entirely free to continue to lockdown for however long your lifestyle allows.
6319,They f’d up rolling out testing on multiple levels and it never should have taken as long as it did.
6320,I certainly hope the vaccine rollout doesn’t go as poorly.
6321,You still can’t get tested in a lot of areas.
6322,The risks of getting the vaccine for anyone healthy under the age of 40 FAR outweigh the benefits at the moment until we know more.

6375,"But if not, that's still fine."
6376,Run them in tandem.
6377,"We have solid estimates of how large each group is, distribute enough for those groups and move on."
6378,"Also, why not have CVS/Walgreens/Walmart check to make sure the person is age 75+?"
6379,"Interestingly the biggest issue isn’t the mass production of the actual vaccine, but the biggest issue is making enough glass vials."
6380,They’re a specialized glass only made in 2 factories.
6381,They started ramping production in July.
6382,"It’s not really a vaccine making problem, but a logistics problem."
6383,Getting enough containers to fill with the right stuff and then sending to the right places.
6384,That’s the challenge now.
6385,He cut the line to get vaccinated.
6386,That’s a problem.
6387,"He should have said “nah, give my shot to a frontline worker, I’ll wait”."
6388,"Sad that our politicians, both sides, jumped the line practically pushing higher risk people out of the way."
6389,"I have a friend in Essex County, NJ."
6390,He’s not a healthcare worker but he volunteered at a vaccine distribution center checking people in for a day.
6391,That makes him a “front line worker” so they gave him the vaccine.
6392,"Meanwhile, not even legit healthcare workers can get the vaccine in my county ¯\_(ツ)_/¯."
6393,Fauci changes his mind on that every other day.
6394,The other day he said between 70% and 90%.
6395,I agree that many people are wearing masks that make it impossible to keep nose and mouth covered - especially those shaped masks.
6396,Most of them are simply too small.
6397,Even my roomy masks slide down when I talk - I need to keep a finger under my chin to stop it.
6398,The South African government made a mistake in dragging out the first lockdown.
6399,"We should have gone to ""level 1"" after the first 5 weeks."
6400,And gone back to level 4 or 5 when the cases started spiking beginning December.
6401,The absurd regulations they made earlier have damaged any trust the community had.

6403,"Your hypotheticals are weak and pointless, go try and convince a ten year old girl."
6404,No.
6405,"This first phase we not only knew where everyone was (healthcare workers and LTC residents), but those entities had their own ability to administer the vaccine."
6406,And it was still fucked up.

6424,So at this rate we will have everyone in the US vaccinated by 2026
6425,The HIV false positives have absolutely nothing to do with either of the two vaccines available in the US.
6426,"The vaccine you’re talking about was only trialed in Australia, and has been abandoned."
6427,"You’re comparing significantly different time periods (300 million over 70+ years, particularly) and forgetting that the only reason we have effective Covid vaccines so fast is because of the new development of mRNA vaccine technology (Spanish Flu in 1918 happened before antibiotics or flu vaccines)."
6428,2 million+ people in a year is a lot.

6444,The early days of this pandemic showed me what I was missing and I spent the first few months once everything started opening back up filling the gaps.
6445,Prior to this I was only a casual prepper but it’s pretty clear that financial stability is one of the biggest factors of being able to stay away from others virtually indefinitely if the circumstances necessitate it.
6446,I found it ironic that the “preppers” really early on were the ones crowded together without masks to protest masks and virus mitigation efforts.
6447,Prior to this I’ve always considered the 3 most likely disaster scenarios that would shake society to be 1- an influenza pandemic 2- a devastating economic collapse and 3- a series of coordinated nuclear detonations that would pollute our lives and necessitate major disruptions (or possibly accidental... although it wouldn’t be wide spread enough).
6448,After reading books on the topic of pandemics like spillover and deadliest enemy I think that in a way we got off easy but the question for the next one is will we learn?
6449,I think yes and no.
6450,For me though the answer is yes and yes.

6525,"Since you work in the industry, does this affect the range of hospitals ambulances can go to?"
6526,"I assume the goal is to go to the nearest/most relevant hospital for the given call, but how far afield would/can an ambulance take someone?"
6527,It sounds bad.
6528,"I’m so sorry, my dude."
6529,"I will still stay at home, despite no order to do so (in Colorado) in hopes that the same thing doesn’t happen here."
6530,The only outside interactions we’ve had were to secure housing and for medical attention.

6532,We wear our masks and sanitize like our lives and others’ lives depend on it.
6533,Because they do.

6540,"Other places have done this and they quarantine the people who are released, for 14 days."
6541,"I mean if you can read Chinese, you can read exactly what he wrote and why the authority might have a problem at the time (IE: to prevent a panic as the facts have not fully been confirmed yet.)"
6542,"Since you probably can't and have to rely on secondary sources, whatever dude."
6543,Cuomo said the state's independent review panel met with New York Health Commissioner Dr. Howard Zucker late Thursday night to approve the state's use of the Pfizer vaccine hours after the FDA advisory panel offered its recommendation.
6544,"https://www.nbcnewyork.com/news/coronavirus/ny-officials-expected-to-unveil-detailed-pfizer-vaccine-distribution-plans-ahead-of-emergency-approval/2775041/

Was there a stipulation of independent review of data readouts or was that your own personal stipulation?"
6545,"...and other places in Europe also--US had 1966 deaths yesterday, but Portugal,Italy,Poland,Austria,Hungary,Bulgaria, and the Netherlands all had higher death numbers per capita--Austria at 4698 US equivalent, Hungary at 4158, and Bulgaria at 4158 were the highest"
6546,This will cause more harm than good and will provide yet another reason for South African police (already known for extrajudicial killings) to harass people for no reason.
6547,"No surprise everyone is cheering it on here, though."
6548,same thing they have been doing all year

6550,Typical politician speak
6551,"Your average healthcare worker knows nothing about how vaccines are researched and developed and brought to market, or what steps were taken to speed up the process for this vaccine."
6552,Nor should they: that's not their job.
6553,But I'd give their opinion about as much weight as any other non-expert opinion.
6554,"NHS worker here, Just had mine, no different from a flu jab, hopefully it does what they say it does and it rolls out in the general population and I can go to the pub again."
6555,"Yes, it’s a colloquialism here (i.e: getting a flu jab)"
6556,"Nope, just an alt account."
6557,That isn't moving goalposts.
6558,That's a college being greedy.
6559,A goalpost move is better defined as the government saying they'll remove X restriction by Y but pushes it back due to Z condition not expected to be met by Y.
6560,"Also, the daily discussion is quite anti-lockdown."
6561,Pro-restriction/lockdown comments are heavily downvoted here.
6562,Hey everyone!
6563,Remember when Hitler made people prove they’d gotten a free vaccine to prevent a deadly virus before they could go to Pinkberry?
6564,The pictures in my history book were truly haunting.
6565,It’s not totalitarian to require proof of vaccination.
6566,We’ve been doing it in schools and workplaces for a long time.
6567,Stop comparing simple public health measures to the Nazis.
6568,Yeah how dare someone not like wearing something over their face at all times!
6569,Grow up.

6596,&gt; L.A. was uniquely vulnerable to this COVID catastrophe.
6597,"Here is ~~what went wrong~~ the propaganda to hide the truth why one of the most restrictive counties in the nation is now the world’s epicenter of the pandemic

How about look in the mirror and realize people stopped caring when their governor and local officials clearly didn’t care enough to not violate their own orders?"
6598,Or when restrictions didn’t seem fair like when movie sets were allowed to film but outdoor dining was closed?
6599,"Someone saved up their DNA points

Are we about to enter the “immediately spend 250 points for all the symptoms” stage?"
6600,"You know those damn CCP bots are prob all over thus sub, all over reddit to be honest... defending China as hardcore as they can..:"

6606,What are the recommended protocols on this?
6607,"Shes from Fermanagh, Legend."
6608,"Im sure that part of that reaction is how many obvious CCP plants and r/sino members trolled these boards, and they were absolutely fucking uncivil and crushed discussion."
6609,"I mean it was obvious in April that Chinas early data was less than truthful, but who really cares, no one outside of the WHO was relying on anything they said anyways."
6610,Also r/sino is flat out a hate sub that I’m still shocked is up.
6611,"Excuse my lack of geopolitical understanding, but I'm glad you get my point."
6612,Ask anyone and im sure they prefer the AZ one over whatever China are producing.
6613,"I can confidently say that if the AZ vaccine isnt approved in my country soon, even the most vulnerable wont be vaccinated at all in 2021."
6614,"No way in hell India approves anything Chinese,lol."
6615,Thats what is at stake.
6616,Time frames are key here.
6617,The 20mil from Spanish flu were over ~3 year period.
6618,The 300mil from smallpox were over 50-100 years.
6619,The ~2mil from COVID are over 1 year.
6620,"We do have better tools, but the fight is not over yet."
6621,So I’ve never thought I had an issue with the flu shot.
6622,But started wearing a fitness tracker (Whoop) about 8 months ago which I never did before.
6623,"My recovery score the day after the shot was like 15%, the lowest I’ve had since getting it."
6624,"Still felt fine, maybe just a little run down."
6625,But interesting to see my body’s reaction to it causing increase heart rate/worse sleep/etc.
6626,Was completely normal by the next day though.
6627,A communist regime hiding how bad shit was???
6628,COLOR ME SHOCKEDDD!!!!
6629,Looking at you Soviets and Chernobyl!

6637,What the fuck is there in a one stoplight town?
6638,What the hell is there when literally everyone else is different to you in every way because you’re an outsider?
6639,Our morgue is full.
6640,I work at one of the biggest private hospitals here in Los Angeles.
6641,So many things
6642,Just book a time 3 months ahead like every other appointment.
6643,Depends on the trust/hospital or clinic where you work.
6644,"Some you have a choice between tunics/trousers and a dress, some just have scrubs for everyone"
6645,"I'm going to say this as nicely as possible, but you've been drinking the conspiracy koolaid and need to come back to normal."
6646,What *possible* motivation would Fauci have for wanting society to be locked down forever?
6647,"Come on, that's an insane idea."
6648,His motivation is for people to be protected and not get sick.
6649,That's all.
6650,My friend said exact same thing.
6651,She’s treating covid patients daily.
6652,She said on her vids she is absolutely not taking the vaccine because covid has been around since the 1930s and in all that time no vaccine was ever made and now in 6 months we have one.
6653,"Then she says, “I just read 2 nurses died after being vaccinated."
6654,I haven’t verified it though but they’re dead.” We’ve distanced ourselves  from her now.
6655,The 1930s thing is easily explained in a simple google search but don’t think she read any of the real history on that.
6656,The vaccine rollout seems to be haphazard.
6657,I know four people who have been vaccinated.
6658,"* A physical therapist, who works in a hospital setting
* An administrator in a non-profit
* My mother and step father

Just seems to be an odd combination, this is especially true as I know a person that works in a nursing home that hasn't gotten it."
6659,"I also know several other medical professionals (nurse practitioner, nurse, physical therapist) that all interact with high risk populations that don't even know when they will get it."
6660,"If you are asking that seriously, I would say it depends on the reclaiming of Taiwan but not the effort dealing with covid."
6661,"Damned if you do, damned if you don't..."
6662,Quiting heroin without help is a death sentence.
6663,"As soon as the relapse, they go back to doing the same amount of heroin but their tolerance has changed."
6664,So they end up ODing and will die if someone is standing next to them with a shot of Narcan.
6665,I wish I hadn't lost as many friends to know this as well as I do.
6666,"Administering, and tracking vaccinations requires money."
6667,Hence the 8.75 Billion of funding.
6668,"People to administer the vaccination, PPE for them, space to vaccinate, vaccine storage, ect."
6669,lol ive never had a side effect from any vaccine
6670,First thing I thought of after I posted.
6671,Incredibly sad.
6672,Lets see what happens to this one.
6673,It definitely did!
6674,Nothing more vulnerable for me than feeling like my body is rejecting it’s needs.
6675,"Bad allergies where I live too, for me they mostly show as should and neck pain from the inflammation."
6676,California bet that with the right policy they could get to vaccination without a major COVID surge.
6677,"It wasn't a terrible bet, given how quickly vaccines were developed, but the risk of suppression is that you risk a bigger wave if suppression fails; [the Imperial College report warned about this in March](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/media/imperial-college/medicine/sph/ide/gida-fellowships/Imperial-College-COVID19-NPI-modelling-16-03-2020.pdf) (""The more successful a strategy is at temporary suppression, the larger the later epidemic is predicted to be in the absence of vaccination, due to lesser build-up of herd immunity"")."
6678,Close enough for a comment.
6679,Large books can be written on the topic.
6680,"Poor leadership at the federal level, especially not initiating the [Defense Production Act ](https://www.fema.gov/disasters/defense-production-act)"

6690,"Yeah, conservatives aren't 100% to blame."
6691,But they've gotta be over 80% of the reason we've been hit like a ton of brick.
6692,You can help it by voting against politicians who value power over thousands of human lives.
6693,You can help it by speaking out.
6694,You can help it by seeing that this isn't an accident or an outlier.
6695,I've said it for years.. democrats are normal people.
6696,There's a mix of good bad and neutral actors.
6697,Conservatives are nearly all in favor of themselves and they don't give half a shit about who they hurt to enrich themselves.
6698,300K dead is just the latest example.
6699,&gt; Why should we assume this?
6700,Because it's Fatalist Fauci.
6701,He's been beating the end times drum since this whole thing started.
6702,"Fuck, even when we all have the vaccine, everything is back open, and cases are down to nearly zero, Fauci will be still be out there, predicting the end of civilization."

6710,Thanks!
6711,I’m kind of thankful because otherwise I would have been unhappy at that job for awhile !
6712,I found another client in March but as covid hit they put all freelancers projects on hold.
6713,I then had two follow up surgeries in May and July.
6714,Thankfully things work wise have been swamped since august!
6715,I have no problem continuing to wear a mask in public until we get cases down to a level where medical professionals no longer deem it necessary.
6716,"But being able to go to the grocery store without having to worry about a solid third of people there having no mask at all (thanks, Arkansas!"
6717,"), and another third apparently unaware that the nose is connected to the respiratory system?"
6718,I'd say being protected from that trash qualifies as a superpower.
6719,If something happened to her at her old age it'd be hard to know what exactly caused it.
6720,"Thank god nothing has happened to her and she's hopefully healthy for many years, but at that age it doesn't take much."
6721,Would definitely be fuel for anti-vaxers even if it's proven the vaccine wasn't responsible.
6722,"Yeah, because your missing smell (or the persistent smell of stale cigarettes) and chronic fatigue just came out of nowhere and has nothing to do with a highly contagious pathogen."
6723,In the beginning of all of this I had a number of friends with obvious Covid symptoms being flat out told they couldn’t get a test because they weren’t in contact with anyone who had a confirmed case of Covid (yet they weren’t allowing people to get tests) or someone who was in Whuhan (I live in a suburb of Pittsburgh where any Asians are few and far in between)
6724,"Sure, but “a lot” is pretty relative."
6725,A lot of young people die from the flu.
6726,~500 people ages 15-24 have died from covid in the US.
6727,Thats comparable to flu deaths.

6749,Yeah but why haven’t they!

6751,Your argument here is strange.
6752,"I state “it’s bizarre to observe.” I’m sharing my life experience in direct relation to the article above (not simply venting my feelings about a random stranger on the internet, as you are)."
6753,"I also state that I recovered in April, which clearly makes me a lucky one, not a victim in any way."
6754,Quite the opposite.
6755,"I’m stating that I find it strange and yes, frustrating, to see a reluctance to accept any optimistic news."
6756,This is a very real phenomenon even if you call it “supposed.” You’ve in fact confirmed how real it is.
6757,Maybe your milieu is different.
6758,"Perhaps I’m surrounded by people who take this very seriously, yet do not read science papers."
6759,Instead they rely on the confusing whirlwind of political rhetoric and media and have subsequently become convinced that you can’t trust anyone and “no one knows anything.” That sort of despair-wrapped apathy and mistrust is dangerous.

6770,Agree with this comment.
6771,And just so frustrating about how the hospital handled it.
6772,Pretty sure they could quickly identify a large number of vulnerable individuals that would jump at the opportunity to obtain one of the extra doses.
6773,"The article didn’t mention if the 30 yo individual had any underlying conditions, so possibly unfair to make an assumption."
6774,"Nevertheless, doesn’t seem to have been handled in the best way possible."
6775,Is that the nurse that fainted during her vaccine and a bunch of morons spread around on Social Media that she had died?
6776,Was it capitalism?
6777,Yeah.
6778,It’s so weird I felt relatively fine since March.
6779,But since the vaccines started coming out I’ve started getting more and more stressed about the world around me

6789,How unintelligent do you have to be to write the words you just wrote
6790,I read some of your other posts and guess your point was that strictly enforcing mask rules ALONE will not make a huge difference.
6791,"This has already been refuted by many [studies](https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/masks-save-lives-heres-what-you-need-to-know-2020111921466), which have shown that even small increases of mask use could have saved many lives."
6792,The payoffs are just too big to ignore.
6793,Indeed mask rules alone cannot defeat the pandemic.
6794,"They also need to be incorporated into a slew of many other public health measures, e. g., targeted shutting down, strict quarantine, separating infected family members from co-habitation, etc."
6795,"However, mask rules are still an integrated component of a web of public health measures."
6796,Not strictly enforcing them leaves too big a hole for other measures to take effects.
6797,Putting all our hope in vaccines can be another fatal mistake.
6798,"The slow public health response to the pandemic could give the virus opportunities to evolve, making the race to produce effective vaccines a lot more difficult."
6799,"First patient, not first trial participant."
6800,"I mean if someone gave us everything, we wouldn’t have to pay for anything."
6801,Why hasn’t any country figured that out yet.
6802,The reason this hits Americans so hard is they have to pay for everything they need.
6803,If everything was free then we could shut down forever with nonnegative consequences.

6856,I thought you were making a comment relevant to the topic.
6857,"To share a daily thread comment:

&gt; A lot of scary headlines out there, folks, but remember to always backcheck the data, media outlets love to showcase stats that can make things appear abnormal, because ""if it bleeds, it leads""!"
6858,This has been a tactic used for centuries.
6859,"&gt; As of December 24, 2020, the national ICU Occupancy Rate - according to New York Times - was at 78%."
6860,"This certainly sounds scary, but when you look at historical data from the National Center for Biotechnology Information, you can see that national average ICU Occupancy rates always hover around 80% occupancy in December/January."
6861,"&gt; Now in case the mods want to ban me for ""misinformation"" (despite having data sources), I would like to acknowledge that COVID-19 is a deadly, serious illness (as many viruses can be)."

6864,Type 2 not so much
6865,I mean he’s not wrong here though.
6866,Faucci lied; anyone with half a brain can see that
6867,Vaccinated people can still catch COVID.
6868,"The vaccines that have been developed and widely trialed thus far have had zero people have a poor COVID outcome, like needing hospitalization."
6869,I assumed it may be an unrelated medical issue.
6870,Obviously if the vaccine did hypothetically cause a problem then yes it would be catastrophic.
6871,"Seeing as I fully support and trust the vaccine however, my brain didn't jump to the conclusion that it would be vaccine related."
6872,Nothing to be concerned about.
6873,What about William Shakespeare?
6874,"Imagine if your husband/wife was in a different country, and you were planning on moving together and closing a long distance relationship this year, and it's all cancelled because even if you want to test negative before and after and do whatever quarantine required your country is banned with no exceptions."

6934,One theory by an acquaintance that tracks hospitalizations is that Dodger and Laker wins were unique super spreader events in LA.
6935,"People were in the streets setting off fireworks - but before that, they were gathered to watch the game together."
6936,"This is not mentioned in the article so possibly public health hasn't found that, or it was just too long ago and part of the seeding events that led to later gatherings becoming so dangerous."
6937,"I agree with the article's observation on quarantine fatigue and misinformation, that really spiked around here in mid October, and the hospitalizations followed a month later."

6976,I guess my view is if they have cash reserves they should be tapping into them in an emergency not depleting FEMA money.
6977,I’m not clear how restrictions on business loans is the problem.
6978,A bank is not all that interested in giving out loans that it can easily predict will be defaulted on which is likely for many small businesses hence the need for PPP

6993,this will be fun for health insurance.
6994,Guess one of the things they'll ask you to determine how much you pay is if you had covid or not.
6995,Because we are POURING money and all kinds of funding with people willing to volunteer in a short amount of time.
6996,"Vaccines “normally” take such a long time because the pharmacy companies need to keep requesting funds, look for enough volunteers and all that jazz which takes a long time."
6997,There were no safety measures that were skipped that would make the vaccine unsafe.
6998,"mRNA technology isn’t witchcraft or new, we’ve been researching it for over a decade."
6999,The world would be extremely fucked if we didn’t have emergency approval for the vaccine for any longer.
7000,"US lockdowns were fairly permeable (They also had very bad compliance, making comparisons of restriction levels difficult."
7001,"), much weaker than the first lockdowns in Europe and Asia, where they did work."

7031,&gt; It is scaring me a little.
7032,"Hopefully the pace will pick up, but if they are only able to do 2 million a week only a third of the US population will be vaccinated by the end of 2021."
7033,There is always a ramp as it takes time to get systems in place and to address unforeseen issues that inevitably come up.
7034,Once the systems are in place and the previously unforeseen issues are ironed out the speed picks up a lot.
7035,As time goes on the amount of people vaccinated each week will keep increasing until everyone who wants a vaccine has them.
7036,No I’m saying the population believes older people are not as valuable.
7037,I’m not saying it’s true.
7038,But it is the intuition of most people.
7039,Why do you think we didn’t do any vaccine trials on kids?
7040,"Because they are considered more valuable, hands down."
7041,"I’m not saying it’s right, but the population is behaving differently for this reason and that’s a big reason why a lot of people don’t give a shit about this virus."
7042,"We do know that no other coronavirus gives long term immunity so we should assume this will also not give anything like the life long immunity you get from chicken pox, however because it's an mRNA vaccine based on the spike protein perhaps we will get lucky and it will last a long time."
7043,I don't see much chance that natural immunity would last with a coronavirus and based on the vaccine makers doubts I don't think this vaccine will last more than 2 years and perhaps quite a bit less time in certain people.

7045,Right.

7077,"In general the federalist nature of the us government means that the federal government is distributing vaccines to the 50 states, DC, the various territories (e.g."
7078,"Puerto Rico), Indian tribes, each group with its own vaccine plan."

&gt; I have been notified by the National Security Council that consistent with Presidential Policy Directive 40 (2016), Congress and the Supreme Court, along with Executive Branch agencies, will be provided with a specific number of COVID19 vaccine doses to meet long-standing requirements for continuity of government operations."
7081,These requirements are focused on essential operations and personnel.
7082,PPD-40 establishes continuity requirements for the Federal Government and states that continuity actions for the Executive Branch should be undertaken in parallel with the Legislative and Judicial branches of government.

7132,My aunt is a medical professional and she was running through the procedure her employer is using.
7133,"Contact a potential candidate, give them 24 hours to confirm, then schedule a time slot if confirmed, if not confirmed move to next name on the list, lather rinse repeat."
7134,So a massive admin headache just from that part of the procedure much less all you pointed out.
7135,Add facilities modification with social distancing in place.
7136,Recordkeeping.
7137,Travel time of employees who work in multi-location companies but that only have one distribution site.
7138,We will get it ironed out and things will be better every week I imagine.
7139,Stay safe!
7140,My side effect is I cant stop telling ppl I got vaccinated
7141,What's going on with the UK's ventilated numbers though?
7142,They've stopped updating them.
7143,So we have no idea how this correlates to intubated numbers.
7144,Something's going on there.
7145,False.
7146,Eradication was not the goal.
7147,Bringing case counts down was the goal and it succeeded in Europe the first time.
7148,It was the same thing for me when I got it.
7149,"My only symptom was no smell, I felt fine the whole time but I stayed in my room most of the time (except to shower, use the restroom and cook food and then bring it to my room), the hardest part was making sure I didnt pass it on to my roommates."
7150,Its different for everyone.
7151,Eh just wait 24 hours
7152,How is it “anti-vax” to not want a specific vaccine that took less than a year to produce?
7153,I agree!
7154,"However to be honest I know so many people who have taken flights this year for sick relatives, funerals, etc."
7155,I am being more cautious than most.
7156,"Isn't it a little bit absurd that ""their job requires it"" is a justified reason to take a flight, but ""help family member deal with death of a loved one"" is not?"
7157,Maybe neither is justified or worth the risk.
7158,But it's telling that making a profit for someone else is considered legitimate no matter what.
7159,"As long as people are working a dead end job that puts them at risk, they are going to feel justified in taking that risk for more personal reasons."
7160,"Honestly, I want to wait for the one time jab version."

7162,Yeah...for the MMR vaccine.
7163,"From your same source, if you look at the other three vaccinations (measles, Hep B, and influenza) France is behind the US."
7164,And we're not a spectacularly high bar to beat.
7165,It depends on the job.
7166,Those who are in professional office type work and some hourly (usually unionized or very progressive company) have health care.
7167,Many people in service industry do not get healthcare and restaurant workers notoriously rely on tips to make over minimum wage of $8-$15 without healthcare.
7168,"If one is unemployed it’s all on individual - people in middle/lower income trapped because they lose coverage if they lose their jobs but risk getting covid19 at work, also extended recovery at home or hospital one loses job then coverage after a short period."
7169,"There is Medicare for over 65, but otherwise it’s a rat race for everyone who is not making 6 figures USA dollars."
7170,The American Dream is to work long enough and stay healthy to not get bankrupted by medical expenses now.
7171,Edibles too?
7172,"Here in Canada, “weed” for smoking was legalized in... 2018?"
7173,"I don’t remember the date, because I can’t smoke weed (bad reaction to the new stuff since the thc levels boosted dramatically in the late 90 and throughout the 21st century)."
7174,But edibles didn’t become legal until this past year.
7175,"In local news, our federal police force recently busted an illegal grow op / edibles / other drugs ring operation and discovered a new brilliant but mean business line — cannabis infused potato chips."
7176,That’s just “wrong” in an “entrapment” kind of way lol.
7177,"I don't expect any impact from vaccination until February/April other than for healthcare workers maybe, but we will see."
7178,Strep throat has been going around where I live
7179,Why are israelis responsible for the vaccination of Palestinians?
7180,They literally have two separate governments.
7181,The president of Palestine and its elected officials are in charge of their own aid and vaccination efforts.
7182,Israel vaccinates all its residents - Jews Arabs and Christian.
7183,"Palestinians (Arabs) living in the West Bank or Gaza, depend on their Palestinian government."

It up with them."

7198,Yup.
7199,Don't you dare question the narrative!
7200,Funnily enough I remember seeing a lot of grumbling from the antivax set that politicians *weren't* getting the shot first.
7201,I honestly believe the reason why politicians are getting the shot so early is for PR reasons - i.e.
7202,to convince the kinds of people who aren't convinced by rigorous stage 3 trial data that the vaccine is safe.
7203,The amount of shots diverted for what is effectively a PR stunt for basic disease control is lower than the amount of vaccine reluctance we would have in a few months if we were more strict about who gets shots.
7204,Or simply have the common sense and decency to not do completely optional travel during a pandemic REGARDLESS of your job situation.

7209,My wife gets hers first on Thursday.
7210,"It was supposed to have been 10 days ago, but the pharmacist at the hospital turned her away due to an epipen prescription she had 8 years ago, unrelated to vaccine or medicine reaction."

7228,You don't need airborne.
7229,Just like HIV but spreading reliably by sex would be catastrophic.

7231,You need a lot to get even to a reasonable chance.
7232,"Hence HIV mostly spreads via longer term relationships (with exceptions)

People cheat, one night stand and pay for sex a lot."
7233,If every sexual encounter spread virus X (and if it remained dormant for some time as HIV does) it could spread quickly enough.
7234,Almost certainly quite widely before we even identified it as a problem.

7390,It is absolutely is a misunderstanding.
7391,"As long as the virus can keep the host alive as long for it to increase its transmissible window, that will be a favorable outcome for it."
7392,"In the long run it is generally true that more transmissible means less deadly, but making that statement about a set of changes which occur in a small window of time is simply not how that theory works and is overly simplistic analysis."
7393,It also ignores the impact on the health system as it simply focuses on biological changes to the virus.

7501,*
7502,I’d prefer to not die of COVID or spread it to my geriatric grandparents and it’s clear that taking no action (i.e.
7503,no compliance with government recommendations) is not working.
7504,"As fucked as the system is, authoritarian regimes (or at least ones that take stronger government actions) have proven that strict regulations is effective at protecting their populations and slowing the spread."
7505,"It’s apparent we will NOT be doing this in the US, so I’ll take my chance with a vaccine versus the disease (both of which we only know a little about)

Call me naive for having trust in authority with a vaccine given its terrible track record in the past few years, but I see no alternative that doesn’t end in widespread disease and death."
7506,I trust science and the many years of research with mRNA vaccines and am willing to put my trust in medicine before random chance of getting a proven deadly disease which may not even provide herd immunity because of reinfections within 6ish months.
7507,Have a nice day!
7508,He has his facts straight.
7509,What he's concerned about is whether someone who has been vaccinated and is effectively protected against the virus could still spread it.
7510,Recall that with this particular virus that there's a very high viral load early on in the infection.
7511,"If the initial infection is in the respiratory tract, then someone who is presymptomatic can spread the virus before their own infection spreads very far just because of that high viral load by breathing it out."
7512,"Assuming they've had the vaccine and it has had time to take effect, the infected person will ultimately fight the disease off before they even feel sick."
7513,"However, because the virus performs its initial replication quickly and does so even before spreading from the initial infection site, it's possible that even people who won't get sick because they're vaccinated could in fact spread the virus for a time before their body kills it."
7514,Which could be a problem.
7515,People thinking they're safe because they're vaccinated could spread the virus to vulnerable people.
7516,I live in California and can confirm the stay at home here is a joke people are wearing masks wrong or none at all .
7517,The only thing closed is legit just barbershops
7518,nigerian strain: help me leave pls
7519,Maybe but everyone just reacts differently.
7520,I had zero side effects from flu shot this year.

7615,"Half-assed lockdown that couldn't bring cases down quickly, but was still mentally exhausting and ravaged small businesses."

7654,"In the state of Indiana, about 4.5% of our population is 80+."
7655,4.8% of our positive Covid-19 tests have been persons over the age of 80.
7656,That would seem about right.
7657,The place where the data greatly changes is that 52.4% of our deaths have been in the over 80 group.
7658,For those in our state that are 60 and over the numbers are a little better.
7659,Census says that 16.1% of our population is 65 and over.
7660,22.4% of the positive tests are for those 60 and over.
7661,BUT... 92.8 percent of the deaths from Covid-19 are 60 and older.
7662,4.5% of our states population are responsible for 52.4 percent of the deaths.

16.1% of our states population are responsible for 92.8 percent of the deaths."

8111,"Its going to quickly make a big impact on the availability of staff to treat the hospitalized, even if it doesn't immediately effect the spread."

8162,The same point as every other vaccine!
8163,That when enough of us have it the human to human spread ceases to exist.
8164,We’ve wiped out viruses with this method and if people pulled their heads out of their asses we could do it again.

8178,"I've had sinus issues my whole life, but this was a lot more serious."
8179,(Spoiler tag because the story is kinda gross).&gt;!I basically got a fungal infection and had to have emergency surgery because it was eroding into my eye socket.
8180,"That was about 5 years ago, and I was supposed to get another surgery, because even though the fungus is gone, the infection irritated the sinus lining and made me very prone to polyps."
8181,I was doing great until about last December.
8182,"I scheduled a cleanup surgery with my ENT, and then COVID delayed the whole thing."
8183,"!&lt;Now it just gets worse each month, and I haven't breathed out of my left nostril in about 3 months."

8387,"On a personal level, if the US can get to 60% or so vaccinated with just Moderna and Pfizer, that means people in my age group (18-30) will have access to a &gt;90% effective vaccine."
8388,The US has already decided to vaccinate working age young adults before working age older adults.
8389,This means I will have a vaccine before my 50 year old mom.
8390,At that point I don’t care if we reach herd immunity because I’ll likely be protected very robustly until we finally do hit the magic number.
8391,"It’s selfish, but the entire world has been during this pandemic."
8392,Do you let your groceries sit for four or five days?
8393,Ah thanks!
8394,Have been curious about asymptomatic transmission with the vaccine.
8395,I assumed it wouldn’t but didn’t realize it was still not known.
8396,Our house is similar!
8397,Wife is a dr and she got her vaccine but in I’m the one who failed science class and am not medical so I’m likely last on the list.

8409,You can't train new doctors overnight.
8410,"&gt; Let us increase the baseline, and deal with the virus like we do the flu."
8411,We will still buckle under uncontrolled exponential growth in case of a similarly sized pandemic.
8412,We can treat this one like the flu once we reach herd immunity.
8413,"Idk, your argument is extremely unconvincing...  Not to mention your utter and complete lack of understanding of immunology."
8414,&gt;I'd side heavily with those who say reinfection is rare (at least this far into the pandemic).
8415,"I haven't personally seen a single case yet, but I've seen thousands of COVID cases."
8416,Good for you.
8417,We have data from over 1000 health care providers that are actively looking at reinfection from all over the world.
8418,I'll take the data that I have in hand rather than the anecdotes of an intern.
8419,"&gt;A few things, the 10s of thousands of cases, those would be confirmed twice according to the math from u/NamesAreDumb123

No, they wouldn't."
8420,The vast majority of people do not have a saved sample from their first infection.
8421,You cannot have a confirmatory test if you don't have a stored sample from the first infection.
8422,You'd also need to have somebody willing to run sequencing on that sample.
8423,"This is an academic venture, not a clinical venture, as there aren't enough resources out there to run seq on every single person that has tested positive twice."
8424,"Lastly, even if two samples were the same, there would be no way to confirm reinfection in a person that has homologous reinfection."
8425,"The criteria for ""confirming"" reinfection is that a person must have been infected by two variants that differ significantly."
8426,Homologous reinfection has been shown for other HCoVs...why are we assuming it doesn't happen with this one?
8427,"&gt;There are only a few hundred confirmed reinfections around the world, and most have shown decreased clinical severity."
8428,Source on that?
8429,"For ""confirmed"" reinfections, there have been 31."
8430,"For those with clinical outcomes, the trend is increased severity."
8431,"&gt;That's a huge difference, because if we went by that metric, for your 7% hypothesis to hold, you'd need millions of suspected reinfections in the US, not 10s of thousands."
8432,I'm astonished that you want to go into infectious disease and just made this statement.
8433,Looks like you didn't edit it after having time to think about it so I'll address it.
8434,Millions of suspected reinfections would only be possible if every single confirmed case has been re-exposed to an infectious dose of the virus again.
8435,Most people haven't had a first exposure.
8436,"Yet somehow, you think that everybody that has had SARS-CoV-2 has been re-exposed?"
8437,Sit in the corner and think about what you've just said.
8438,"&gt;Also, your 7% evidence is extremely weak."
8439,One in vitro assay on PBMCs in a preprint?
8440,Who said that was my only evidence?
8441,That's the evidence for waning immunity from a perspective of immunological memory.
8442,Why is that the only evidence?
8443,"Because it's the strongest paper on the topic, conducted by a world renowned virologist, and one that received press all over the world."
8444,"Also, it's not *in vitro*..."
8445,These are patient samples.
8446,Have you even read the paper?
8447,How about even the abstract?
8448,There are numerous papers that show failure to generate neutralizing antibody responses going all the way back to Wuhan.
8449,https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/fullarticle/2769741 5.7% didn't have neutralizing antibody responses.
8450,"https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/22221751.2020.1823890 Figure 1d, more than 7% without neutralizing antibodies in mild cases."
8451,https://jcm.asm.org/content/58/12/e02005-20 Between 83.1% and 92.7% had neutralizing antibodies from recovered patients.
8452,"If this is new to you, you might want to take some time to better understand the virus infecting the patients you are treating and the immune responses to that virus."
8453,Also doom.
8454,So much doom.

8505,Democrats aren’t a monolith and political parties should not be.

8526,Hmm...given the side effects of the vaccines (like fever) some hospitals are staggering their staff based on vacation/days off to get the vaccine to make sure they have enough support.

8532,It’s not a hard concept.
8533,The question of whether I could asymptomatically pass the virus hasn’t been answered so I don’t want to risk being a vector.

8602,Lots of alcoholics however that is not them problem.

8633,Voter ID is mostly about voter suppression.
8634,"There isn't widespread fraud, and it's highly unlikely that there could be widespread fraud given the high risk and effort to impact small numbers of votes per person."
8635,"Meanwhile, obtaining voter ID can be costly, time-consuming, and in some cases next to impossible for people who don't have other forms of appropriate ID."
8636,"Voters who have their ID lost, stolen, or just arbitrarily invalidated by a poll worker who says it's not a match, can end up with little to no recourse and disenfranchisement of their right to vote."
8637,Vaccine verification is about saving lives.
8638,"There is widespread infection, and it's likely that for anything like a school, cruise, concert, etc... that infection would occur unless we restrict these things."
8639,Obtaining proof of vaccination is automatically given with the vaccine for free.
8640,"Any issues of that proof being lost, stolen, or needing to be verified can be done easily since there's the originating database and facility that administered the vaccine."
8641,"&gt;With our digital, computerized health care infrastructure, you don't have a way to track down people who ""forgot"" to get the second dose, without using an Apple iPhone?"
8642,That's the only way?
8643,Really?
8644,The article makes it pretty clear that patients are also given a conventional card.
8645,"However, this is an *additional* way that will help people know and provide an easy way to provide proof."
8646,They've even addressed the fact that this *additional* method won't be universal and thus the conventional methods will still be used.

8653,"For their parents, it’s about 8%."
8654,"If you’re surrounded by reasonably healthy twentysomethings, you see the death risk as minimal, because, statistically, for them, it is."
8655,"If you’re surrounded by elderly people, cancer patients with chemo-destroyed immune systems, and other at-risk groups, the death rate gets a lot more concerning."
8656,"Well, plenty of Americans certainly did try to fix our nation's Healthcare system but the GOP wouldn't allow it."
8657,It's really that simple.
8658,The system is broken by intent for profit.
8659,Its going to take more than a couple truthful years.
8660,But Fauci said what he said to minimize negative effects.
8661,A population without masks is a disaster.
8662,Anon-existent medical staff because we didn't prioritize them would have been cataclysmic.
8663,Saving lives was still his priority.
8664,It's consistent with the data in the study; more people had side effects after the second dose.
8665,"In the Moderna trial, less than 1% of the participants had a fever after the first injection, but 15.6% had one after the second dose (table 22, page 61 of the Moderna provided data: [https://www.fda.gov/media/144452/download](https://www.fda.gov/media/144452/download))."
8666,"The fever happens after the second dose because the body recognizes the virus (specifically the spikes) and mounts an immediate antibody response, which is associated with a fever."
8667,this is the exact same logic people used at the start of the pandemic to paint the flu as a bigger deal than the virus.

8968,"**Some** lessons:

1."
8969,Anyone without a serious science background should play no role in policy related to a pandemic.
8970,2.
8971,If you care about lives and business your best bet is to do one big serious lockdown and not lift it until there are no cases.
8972,If all countries took this approach we would've been done with this many months ago.
8973,3.
8974,During a pandemic setup field hospitals in all areas and only allow one regular hospital in an area to accept pandemic patients.
8975,You cannot kill off people with other conditions because suddenly there is a pandemic.
8976,4.
8977,Mask use should be enforced from day one seriously.
8978,People caught not wearing a mask should be escorted out of any public place immediately.
8979,Even if masks reduce the spread by 5% (and we know its much higher or every medical professional would have gotten covid and other diseases by now) it is enough to enforce it.
8980,5.
8981,Reduce mental stress by unleashing every possible economic package to help people and businesses.
8982,6.
8983,Countries need to stockpile PPE for medical professionals and regular masks for citizens.
8984,Countries should have factories ready to go live should a pandemic hit.
8985,The same is for other possible items like ventilators and other devices that might be needed.

8990,Crazy.
8991,Did you test in between your initial positive and your most recent test?
8992,Creating a law to force the American people to wear a mask or face jail time is fundamentally against everything about America and freedom.
8993,"Those small steps are what creates tyrants and dictators, especially when people go along with them."
8994,"To me, it appears that you aren’t thinking enough."
8995,So the incarerated get the vaccine before those with underlying conditions?

8997,Perhaps one day science will find a way to cure my poisoned mind.
8998,"I will pray to science in the meanwhile and rest assured that all of my opinions are based on ignorance, unlike those of the infallible science speakers."
8999,Should I take a rain check from work?

9001,"Slight headache, occasional nausea, hot flashes and cold chills."
9002,"My sense of taste and smell are pretty much what they have been since post covid, I haven’t tested positive for covid at work and these symptoms been off and on for the last month."

9454,Your choice of not getting vaccine = you getting sick = other people getting sick that have yet to have had the vaccine.

9598,I am surprised that the US hasn't reported any temperature control issues as it has vast distances to cover.
9599,I imagine that Germany and the US would have comparable experience and technology in cold storage.
9600,Why have relatively small European countries had these issues but the US hasn't?
9601,PS I am not suggesting a cover-up or conspiracy just curious because Australia will have huge issues maintaining temperature outside major cities.

9689,Either because of people being idiots/culture or your countries setup ore covid is conducive to covid.
9690,Normally a bit of both.
9691,I dont think that was the only reason china only had about 100k cases.

10217,I work in EMS so it’s something I constantly pay attention to.
10218,"I think people should wear them and I do wear them because it’s a not a lot to ask for what ever value it has, but I don’t think that their as effective in real world scenarios as are reported in studies because cases are skyrocketing anyway in my area even though almost everyone is compliant."
10219,I think making them a criminal offense is nuts.
10220,"Again I wear them all the time and feel its the right thing to do, but how many times have I walked up to a grocery store and realized I left my mask in my car, and immediately turned around and grabbed it (I have never entered a building without one on), but it’s not inconceivable to me someone could innocently forget it."
10221,Should we lock them up?
10222,Maybe make it punishable by death since their commuting murder?
10223,I suspect my 91 year old grandmother in law has gone “rouge” and just entered a store without one because she innocently forgot (as much as we ask her not to go out).
10224,"She’s not refusing to wear one with intent, so she be subject to criminal charges?"
10225,"For everyone saying it’s like forgetting your pants and or leaving your genitalia out, your raised since birth to be used to making sure these don’t happen, but wearing a mask in any public setting is new to people."
10226,It doesn’t have a life time of muscle memory behind it.
10227,"If these is still going on 10 years from now this would be a fair comparison, but 9 months is still newish to people."
10228,"People should wear them for what ever protection they offer others, but all I am saying is making them a criminal offense is crazy."
10229,A bigger question I have is why are frontline workers getting the vaccine before vulnerable populations?
10230,"Most front line workers are not in a high risk demographic and were supposed to be doing everything to protect those who are high risk, so why give them the vaccine first?"
10231,"The volunteer firemen in my town are getting the shots before the elderly, our fire department doesn’t turns over medical care to EMS before they take their scba units."
10232,Why do they need it but the elderly or sick still don’t?
10233,"Since I am in EMS I can get the vaccine now, but I would rather those in my family who are truely at risk get it first."
10234,"Because these masks at best offer a small level of protection from giving it to others, but the vaccine could protect those who covid is a death sentence to."
10235,And what I find most funny is these laws are being put in place by politicians who will skip right to the front of the vaccine list because their “essential”.
10236,They should learn to use zoom like the rest of us and get to the back of the vaccine line.
10237,I'm not a scientist but couldn't they use these fancy number paintings to figure out which people to focus on?

10240,If you care about lives and business your best bet is to do one big serious lockdown and not lift it until there are no cases.

10253,There are a minority who don't think or only think selfishly.
10254,If that minority is above the threshold to prevent herd immunity.
10255,Is the majority meant to be at risk until enough of that minority are in hospital with covid19 ?

10455,"At that time, it seemed to me there weren't so many dummies like the previous commenter alluded to."
10456,"Also, there was much more social shaming and action against any right wingnut outbursts."
10457,Apparently things.are changing.
10458,It is like a .0000001% chance that you can still transmit the virus after you’ve had the vaccine.
10459,It’ll be within 4- 6 months that we will know “for sure”.
10460,"Yes, these aren't the first studies to indicate that truly asymptomatic people tend not to spread as well as symptomatic or presymptomatic people."
10461,"it has heartening implications for the vaccines, because in Pfizer in Moderna's case, should the implication hold to be true, they'll at the very least reduce at least some spread in 95% of all those vaccinated."
10462,[removed]
10463,But there isn't evidence yet that getting the vaccine prevents you from being infectious if you get the virus.
10464,It just prevents you from getting sick.
10465,"If we assume EVERYONE who voted for Trump think it's a hoax, that's only 1/3rd of America."
10466,"I'm not sure what percentage of Republicans think it's a hoax, but I can't imagine it's anywhere near 100%."
10467,It hasn't been demonstrated but it has been suggested from retrospective studies in Italy and China.
10468,"So the answer is, yes, it is likely that a higher viral load exposure is more lethal."
10469,"For example, some lady coughing near you at target with your mask on is a smaller amount of virus inhaled compared to standing next to an ICU patient with COVID and adjusting his mechanical vent settings twice a day, or meeting a child in the ER who is in respiratory failure, and you need to stand over him and intubate him rapidly before he dies -- not knowing his COVID status yet but suspecting it."
10470,"Yeah, healthcare workers are literally taking these risks for what?"
10471,A paycheck and a weird promise they made to themselves to save lives some day after college.
10472,"So everyone who doesn't wear masks, doesn't want the vaccine, doesn't adhere to social distance and avoiding large gatherings: FUCK YOU."

10479,Still plan on getting it when they get around to me.
10480,I always wondered about this.
10481,"If the vaccine prevents 95% of symptomatic infection, people could still have very very mild symptoms and not even bother to notice they were infected."
10482,"Does that mean that they could then get the long haul covid symptoms though, even though they got vaccinated (if they end up with very mild covid)?"
10483,"Masks don’t do shit unless you have the n95, I see about 1 out of 20 people wearing them

11099,I think you're missing my point and I think we're in much closer agreement than you're portraying.
11100,Nobody is arguing that the virus is more likely to spread when people are close together (without protocols and PPE).
11101,That's scientific.
11102,Nobody is arguing for any absurd standard of proof.
11103,"Just as science says the virus is far more likely to spread indoors, the science says it's unlikely to outdoors with proper distancing (ignoring your pizza with red wine indoors proof example because it was clearly not made in good faith)."
11104,"Since the first lockdown, which I supported because the virus was brand new and truly unknown, we have achieved much more science and data to show how businesses can operate safely."
11105,That's why guidelines were developed.
11106,That's why safety improvement investments were made.
11107,We've had months of actual real world experience to show that they have operated safely.
11108,"That is the real context behind the latest sweeping and arbitrary policies, and that's why people are fighting back."
11109,"Obviously in an ideal situation, there can be a proper lockdown, and people/businesses that are suffering can be helped directly by the government for something completely out of their control."
11110,But our government has shown that they don't care to do this.
11111,Those that can operate safely should be given the chance to.
11112,Instead we have certain industries (e.g.
11113,"sports, entertainment) that are somehow deemed essential despite proven spread (i.e."
11114,$$$) while others with proven relative safety are forced to shut down.
11115,"With that the case, the argument can be made that the State's knowingly and casually destroying livelihoods (and thus lives) without scientific backing is far more immoral than even doing nothing."
11116,This is because the government is CHOOSING which lives to destroy knowingly without any sort of compensation and that willful choice to value one group's lives over another arbitrarily is the perspective worth highlighting here.
11117,"It's wrong to generalize and blame all business owners and people (granted there are those that are acting in bad faith as well), because many if not most of them are similarly just trying to survive and hold onto their lives."

This vaccine has been validated in some countries
And in your eyes, Pfizer's vaccine is, absolutely, effective."

11414,"So as I said, China is far worse than you in the West in terms of propaganda
The West, too, has been propagandized for so many years that it doesn't care what the facts are anymore."

11494,oh well it's the best we have so we just have to make it work.
11495,"&amp;#x200B;

&gt;The science behind this seeming contradiction is relatively straightforward."
11496,Vaccines like Pfizer’s and Moderna’s are injected into deep muscle and provide so-called systemic immunity.
11497,"But they may still leave areas, particularly [nasal mucous passages](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/12/08/health/covid-vaccine-mask.html), where the virus is relatively free to multiply."
11498,"Even without making the host sick, that virus can then potentially spread through coughing or sneezing, just as it is spread by a person with a full-blown coronavirus infection."
11499,"&gt;  
&gt;“Having systemic immunity is like having a security guard that’s somewhere in the building,” says Joshua Michaud, an epidemiologist at KFF (formerly the Kaiser Family Foundation)."
11500,"“Having mucosal immunity is like having a security guard right at the door, ready to take on the incoming virus.”

&amp;#x200B;

I think it's still mostly good news."
11501,"People may infect others, but those who are vaccinated should still have massively reduced symptoms if any."
11502,"It's also quite possible any infection they spread will be loss potent, though realistically this is mostly a factor of the other persons genetics more than viral load..."

11505,I have already heard of two that died on the flight or right afterward.
11506,One was on a Southwest flight.
11507,It was a woman.
11508,The other one was a man and I don’t remember what airline it was but I’m sure you could Google it.
11509,It would also appear that there are some perverse incentives in the vaccinations for front-line health workers in some hospital systems.
11510,"Specifically, it seems that some hospital systems wish to limit the number of same-day vaccinations within different work groups within the hospital in order to prevent a shortage of staff if workers have to call out sick from post-vaccination side effects."
11511,"I can kind of understand why they'd be concerned about that, especially if they're already stretched thin with staff coverage of shifts."
11512,I didn't know the health department asks.
11513,I thought they told.
11514,Thank you kind stranger
11515,Reading what you supplied doesn’t differentiate between prevention from infection or prevention of severe symptoms.
11516,After some lite reading it appears no one is sure which is true.
11517,Guess we’ll find out.
11518,"As I have heard from multiple doctors, the assumption is it prevents serious disease in 95%."
11519,Of course I could be interpreting things incorrectly.
11520,"According to the CDC I do not need a negative test to break isolation, the guidelines are: 10 days after initial symptoms began, symptoms have improved, and no fever for 72 hours without fever reducing meds."
11521,"That's fine, but again, I keep having people say ""well, we'd see more reports of this if it were happening""."
11522,We see the reports.
11523,They just can't be verified.
11524,Miami has 3.0 people in the average household compared to 2.8 in LA.
11525,And it’s only 86% for the Moderna one for people aged 65 and above.
11526,Yes!!
11527,"Glad to hear it, I'm looking forward to this number rapidly increasing :)"
11528,&gt; But why didn't you use the same date?
11529,I used the latest polls from the same company for both countries.
11530,&gt; Your link which polled Americans was performed back in September.
11531,I don't expect much to have changed in a couple of months.
11532,"&gt; Not exactly a fair comparison, and not enough data to make the claim that the UK has less anti-vaxxers."
11533,"Well the proof will be in the pudding, let's see how many brits vs americans as a percentage of the population take a COVID 19 vaccine if offered."
11534,LOL clearly I'm no stranger to long posts.
11535,I definitely have the gift of gab.
11536,"(Believe it or not, I was very shy until just in the past few years.)"
11537,Too bad Moderna and Pfizer literally only tested people if they got symptoms.
11538,Oxford tested everyone weekly.
11539,They naturally detected more asymptomatic cases.
11540,But nobody who took the Oxford in the trials got severe symptoms nor was hospitalised.
11541,Rendering it similar to a cold to anyone with symptoms or fully asymptomatic.
11542,Which is still great of course.
11543,"But with the mix of anti-vaxxers and people who medically cannot get vaccinated we'll still be dealing with this in a small scale for years, it could still be circulating unknown among people and then it could mutate into something where the current vaccine doesn't work for."
11544,And rinse and repeat due to humanity's stupidity.
11545,&gt;85
11546,So vaccinate two million a week.
11547,Thanks for stepping in here.
11548,"Some people, amIright?"
11549,It's almost like it's common sense that things are shut down during the holidays and some states literally said they weren't reporting on Xmas Eve and Day.
11550,people like that can't even fathom that they could have been the cause of someone else getting sick and dying.
11551,Its always someone else
11552,Oh fuck off.
11553,"I bet you're another privileged white guy virtue signaling about structural marginalization while 52,000 black people have died due to covid this year, more than have died due to police interactions for the last fifty."

11566,The “concern” is manufactured.
11567,"By writing vague headlines like this talking about “variants” and “strains”, the writers are alluding to terminology common to discussion of the much more familiar flu viruses, particularly in the context of immunity evasion."
11568,"These headlines imply, without outright stating (because if they stated, they’d be lying) that there’s a danger of immunity evasion with &lt;insert genetic variation in the virus here&gt; and stoke public fears of having to start the pandemic over."
11569,Fear inducing headlines get clicks.
11570,they're generally the personality type that will disregard non-personal aspects to society as well.
11571,I'm Taiwanese too!
11572,"Did you notice the one video that was titled something like ""little dog starves to death at home; sanitation workers come to disinfect"" but then when you watch the video she doesn't speak to anyone so there's no information and it's just one minute long showing workers in PPE disinfecting what looked like a garage/storage unit/maybe store front??"

11576,"not only that but its not like they disinfect or biofog the plane between flights its drop off, refuel load up and off the next destination"
11577,You need a negative test before you go back around anyone.

11579,"That's totally okay, it's nice to have something to do besides watch TV."
11580,"You're right, the timing was terrible, I've been sick since the 18th and am supposed to continue to quarantine until New Year's Eve."
11581,"I know people are getting weary and starting to slip up on precautions--I was starting to get a little complacent myself and slack off a bit, just before I got sick."
11582,And just wearing a mask isn't enough to protect you; I was wearing mine and got sick anyway.
11583,I see so many people wearing disposable gloves and touching their faces or belongings with their dirty gloves.
11584,Good hand hygiene is the thing that gets lost in all the mask wearing and social distancing.
11585,I think dirty hands are what did me in.
11586,I haven't been in the hospital or anything and so far I seem to be making a full recovery.
11587,I don't expect to get any sort of aftercare or testing or anything to make sure I'm okay.
11588,"That's unfortunately not how healthcare works in the United States and even if it was, the hospitals are overwhelmed right now and I don't have health insurance, so I couldn't afford to get any tests run anyway."
11589,"Plus, not all of these things are even visible, and knowing that a person has them doesn't necessarily tell you much."
11590,"For example, suppose a test were to show that I did have an inflammation in the inner wall of my heart as a result of Covid."
11591,"We still wouldn't know how long it would last, whether it would permanently weaken my heart, or even whether it would be best to rest completely or get mild exercise to strengthen my heart muscle (or how much exercise would be safely tolerable)."
11592,And then of course there's no way to know by looking at someone if they will have ongoing fatigue or when/if their sense of smell will come back.
11593,"To some extent, we just have to trust our bodies to take care of themselves the best they can and try not to stress about it."
11594,"Probably easier for people who didn't already have issues with mild anxiety before they got sick, although to add another layer to the eternal Covid hellscape, it can also cause new or worsening anxiety in people who've had it."
11595,I've spent a lot of time focusing on the positive changes in my body as I recover and trying to stay upbeat and remind myself that whatever is going to happen is going to happen whether I worry about it or not and that worrying can actually make things worse.
11596,"What I really, really want, and can't have, is for someone to give me a hug and tell me it's going to be okay."
11597,"But nobody is supposed to get within six feet of me, nobody knows for sure that it's going to be okay, and the only family I have left is my younger sister who is also sick on top of recently being diagnosed with MS, and I feel like I'm the one who should be comforting her, not the other way around."
11598,"This virus is hands-down the most isolating, lonely thing I've ever experienced."
11599,"I didn't have much of a social life before the pandemic, but I'm definitely going to find some real-life friends after this is over."
11600,Chickenpox is caused by a type of herpes virus.
11601,This type of virus usually stays in your body forever.
11602,(Think about a cold sore and how it can go away for years and then come back in the exact same spot.
11603,That's also a type of herpes.)
11604,The same virus causes shingles.
11605,So anyone who's ever had chickenpox has the possibility of getting shingles later in life.
11606,"In the United States, they recommend a shingles vaccine for people aged 50 or older to reduce their chances of getting shingles or make it less severe if they do get it."
11607,"I also had it as a child, because at the time, our understanding of the virus was that everybody got it, only got it once, and then was fine, and it was better to get it when you were young because it was less severe."
11608,We had no idea there was any connection between chickenpox and shingles.
11609,And that's my concern with Covid.
11610,"Our understanding is evolving as more people get it, and we have no idea how much we don't know about this thing or what we might discover years down the road about how, like chickenpox, it wasn't as harmless as we first thought."
11611,"It really sucks for those of us who've had it that we may have a ticking time bomb inside our bodies, but on the other hand, it would be equally sucky to spend our Ives worrying about what might happen only to find out we all recovered as fully as we first thought and will die of natural causes in our 90s."
11612,"And as much as I'd give anything not to have this, on some level it's also a bit of relief, because I'm surrounded by people who refuse to take precautions and my job requires taking care of disabled adults so I'm at constant risk of exposure."
11613,"And there are risks as well as benefits to the vaccine, but the risks with the vaccine are also present with the virus itself, so having already had the virus, I'm much less concerned about getting the vaccine."
11614,Thanks for the well wishes.
11615,:) This has been a terrible year with a terrible ending and I'm looking forward to kicking 2020 out the door and starting fresh.
11616,Surely 2021 has to be better!
11617,"I'm usually not much of a New Year's kind of person, it's the beginning of spring that makes me feel like making a fresh start, but this year I'm really hyped to see the year change over."
11618,But why didn't you use the same date?

11659,Many deniers will become believers for money.
11660,I know what you mean man.
11661,I really do.
11662,But one of the problems that goes with that is that people can make up some bullshit story that they got reinfected which won’t be true at all.

11667,Senior citizens?
11668,I saw my post-covid younger coworker have trouble with their memory.
11669,This is why I want to take the vaccine before the actual virus can get to me.
11670,"Because I know it will cause cognitive changes, which could last a while."
11671,These are the types of effects that are harder for an outside observer to quantify.
11672,It is not like lung damage or a stroke or lost limb from blood clots.
11673,But it is just as real.
11674,There's a reason I used the same company for both polls.
11675,For obvious reasons the poll you've cited there which lacks a 'don't know' or 'unsure' option is not comparable to one that does.
11676,Maybe Medicare rates.
11677,"Across all studies, payments from private insurers are much higher than Medicare payments for both hospital and physician services."
11678,So this would make sense how hospitals are making their money back.
11679,"Private insurers paid nearly double Medicare rates for all hospital services (199% of Medicare rates, on average), ranging from 141% to 259% of Medicare rates across the reviewed studies."
11680,"The difference between private and Medicare rates was greater for outpatient than inpatient hospital services, which averaged 264% and 189% of Medicare rates overall, respectively."

11685,Anti-vaxx is a weird thing that's mostly more middle class people and exists among both sides of the political aisle.

11688,To give a background.
11689,"There are two separate government bodies - RosStat (statistics), and RosPotrebNadzor (consumer rights)."
11690,The first is responsible for general statistics and the second for C-19 handling.
11691,RosStat when it comes to raw numbers is quite precise.
11692,"They might ""cheat"" in some compound stats (like inflation), but how they do it is mostly public as they publish their methodologies."
11693,"To count deaths, RosStat collects its data directly from ZAGS (offices responsible for registering all newborns and deaths)."
11694,RosPotrebNadzor numbers are collected in a different way.

11698,"So, back to the article."
11699,"It says ""Russia admits...""."
11700,"No, it doesn't."
11701,"The only difference now is that one of the ministers, when asked directly, said that RosStat isn't wrong and that both numbers are correct, and the difference comes from the fact that RosStat and RosPotrebNadzor have different methodologies."
11702,No changes in the way how RosPotrebNadzor numbers are counted is announced.
11703,"As for RosStat numbers, they're available with a slight delay at the end of each month."
11704,Oh I fully agree.
11705,"I stopped listening to them pretty much altogether, but that’s another story"
11706,Are you talking about the scientific article I literally just posted Demonstrating long-term immunity?
11707,I’ve heard that TAL episode and it seemed to be focused on protecting the feelings of obese people.
11708,"Here’s the deal: every human deserves to be treated with dignity; however, obesity is not ok for long-term health."
11709,Flights should have mandatory COVID insurance so that if you test positive you  get your money back.
11710,"That would 1) increase the price of flying so that less people travel, which is a good thing right now 2) remove an incentive for covid positive people to lie because of sunk costs."
11711,Depends on the county in texas it's far from easy for a 65 year old to get it at this point but definitely making progress which is good.

11721,Fortunately my state just passed a law mandating 56 sick hours a year.
11722,However I work ten hour shifts.
11723,For regular 8 hour employees that's fine they get seven sick days.

11733,"Comrade, plz stop."
11734,One more million in about a week or so (hopefully) and we will be at 1% of the population vaccinated.
11735,It’s going to be a longer road than people are expecting but glad to be heading in the right direction.
11736,"I think the approach if being careful, unlike they did in the past, is smarter."
11737,If people fear it does not have sterilizing immunity that means more people have to get vaccinated to get the same effect.
11738,"It COULD turn out to be more true than we'd like, so it's smart to just stay ahead of the problem."
11739,It COULD also simply be a way to push those who think others getting vaccinated is good enough the edge to the point they want the vaccine.
11740,"Who is better off overplaying the threat at this point, they did more than enough downplaying it already."
11741,"Actually, that's exactly how some viruses like the Spanish Flu work."
11742,"People get killed by their own immune system responding to the virus, so people with healthier immune systems tended to do the worst."
11743,"Ah Newark, NJs second biggest shithole behind Camden"
11744,Makes sense.
11745,In some states you can't even get beer in gas stations (e.g.
11746,"Utah, Minnesota) so liquor stores would truly be essential."
11747,I guess you could drink mouthwash though
11748,This is damn accurate.

11752,I wish you the best.
11753,Hopefully you remain safe and lucky for the next few weeks until you can get the 2nd dose.
11754,I’m sorry most folks still don’t understand that we’re not at the endgame yet and vaccines aren’t full proof or instantaneous even when they do work as expected.
11755,Edit: typos.
11756,Why do americans always assume everyone else is american?
11757,good luck explaining this to 95% of people
11758,"""I'm a scientist"" means almost nothing in this context."
11759,This is not a generalist area of knowledge.

11761,There's zero rest stops along the B-W parkway.

11763,3rd times a charm I guess.
11764,I presume it's viral load
11765,"100% this

I've had influenza twice in my life and both times thought I was dying."
11766,I've had countless colds.
11767,Not the same thing.
11768,Not really.
11769,"They do have one of the highest spreads in the country right now (1/1000 per day), which is very bad, but that’s still only half of North Dakota’s peak rate from the fall, and their total cases and deaths per capita are well in the lower half of the states."
11770,They’re now in a race with the vaccines to see how high those numbers climb before dropping.
11771,No proof of sterilizing immunity AND you need time after the vaccination to reach full effect.

11773,If you're wondering who has ordered this one: India has ordered about 500 million and the US 100 million.
11774,"While I agree that people should wear masks, we're most likely in this mess because of private gatherings, not because of non compliance with mask wearing."
11775,"So all these donations that people make to food banks, millions in charity, wonder what happens to that money"
11776,This is... Weird
11777,"I believe by april, after the majority of elderly and vulnerable people are vaccinated."
11778,Doubt most people will stay indoors after the death rate plummets.
11779,What in god’s name are you going on about
11780,That’s all we can say for sure but that is absolutely not the consensus opinion in the medical field.

11798,&gt;Is there any developed country that could or would try to give vaccines to third world countries?
11799,Yes.
11800,I believe [Bill Gates](https://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/health/gates-foundation-adds-70-million-for-covid-19-vaccines-in-poor-countries/) is helping work on that and the upcoming Biden administration will most certainly work with him on this.

11805,Thank you.
11806,Pueyo’s been right so far.
11807,Also the math just works - if the R0 is larger then the number of immune people you need to slow the spread goes up.
11808,WRT children: herd immunity is about reducing the number of infectious people and while kids get less sick than adults they do get sick and they are infectious.
11809,Testing is underway in kids as young as 12.
11810,Asymptomatic transmission is whats driving the spike right now.

11843,I agree.
11844,Just curious cause most restaurants are only take out so less employees working and also most of the tech companies are work from home but I still see quite a bit of traffic almost to normal amounts especially on 880.
11845,It's quite the opposite: underinflated
11846,Same for you and your family.
11847,"We are now at 1 out of every 1000 Americans dying from COVID, so I'm eagerly waiting for everyone to get the same opportunity I do with the vaccine."

11900,They knew this question would come up and they’d have been the only one to answer it.
11901,The answer is what you’d expect; the vaccine prevents infection rather than promoting some theoretical carrier state.

11991,"You don't have to use this register to punish people, but at some point we're going to get to a point where there's still a significant number of new cases and deaths being reported, but most of them will be among people who refused a vaccine."

12096,"&gt;More than half of England is under the nation’s strictist lockdown measures, and people have been ordered to stay at home, but the coronavirus is still spreading at an alarming rate."
12097,"Hospitals are treating more patients than at any time during the pandemic, and there is a growing debate about allowing tens of thousands of students to return to classrooms after the holiday break."
12098,"&gt;The nation’s scientists have said that a more contagious variant of the virus is driving the rise in cases and, having already imposed severe restrictions on more than 48 million people, it remains unclear what other tools the government has at its disposal to get the outbreak under control."
12099,"&gt;There were 41,385 new lab-confirmed cases reported on Monday, the highest figure yet on a single day."
12100,"The National Health Service said there were now over 20,000 people in the hospital, more than at the peak of the pandemic in April."
12101,"&gt;With the government scheduled to meet to evaluate the current restrictions on Wednesday, Prime Minister Boris Johnson is under pressure to impose another national lockdown and move students — especially older ones in colleges and secondary schools, who may be more easily infected by the new virus variant — to remote learning."
12102,"&gt;The government said that it would rely on mass testing to keep the virus from spreading in schools, with military help."
12103,"Some 1,500 soldiers are being dedicated to providing schools with the “guidance, materials and funding they need to offer rapid testing to their staff and students from the start of term,” according to the education secretary, Gavin Williamson."
12104,"&gt;But two teacher unions have said that staff has not been given adequate time to set up mass testing and the country’s board of scientific advisers, known as SAGE, has recommended against allowing classrooms to reopen, according to British media reports."
12105,"&gt;Even as the country’s health workers find themselves under growing pressure to treat the influx of patients, they are also being asked to speed up the largest mass vaccination program in the nation’s history."
12106,"Around 200,000 people are getting their first shot of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine every week."
12107,"With the approval of a vaccine from AstraZeneca and the University of Oxford expected in coming days, the number of doses available will expand drastically."
12108,"The AstraZeneca vaccine, which comes without the stringent temperature requirements of Pfizer’s, should also be easier to distribute."
12109,"There is no evidence that the vaccines are any less effective against the variant of the virus spreading in Britain, and they remain the best chance for the country to break the back of the current wave of infection sweeping across the country."
12110,"But to meet the government’s promise to vaccinate all those over the age of 50 by spring, the speed of delivery would have to be 10 times as fast as it is now."
12111,"That will require not just supply, but the staff to deliver the vaccines."

“Many of us have lost family, friends, colleagues and — at a time of year when we would normally be celebrating — a lot of people are understandably feeling anxious, frustrated and tired,” he said, delivering his remarks from a vaccination center on Tuesday."
12116,"“Therefore now is the right time, I believe, on behalf of the whole country to record our enormous debt of gratitude and our huge thanks.”

Interesting how the media puts it

Rosstat publishes the population dynamics statistics (which includes all-cause mortality) each month, and staring from April they have ben including in it a separate table on COVID mortality, separated in four categories: COVID is laboratory confirmed and is the primary cause of death; COVID is the suspected primary cause of death but not confirmed; COVID isn't the primary cause but significantly contributed; COVID is neither the primary cause nor significantly contributed."
12218,"And the fact that daily reports on COVID deaths include only laboratory confirmed cases where COVID was the primary cause of death wasn't a secret either - that's the way the cause of death is listed on death certificated in Russia (and some other post-Soviet countries, I think) - it's always what ultimately caused the body to cease functioning, everything else is listed as concomitant conditions."

12320,"Or when a business states ""no shirt, no shoes, no service""....is that repressive?"
12321,Or is it because people are soft and can't deal with even the smallest amount of discomfort by having a piece of cloth over their nose.
12322,Surgeons and nurses who have always worn masks for their work don't find it repressive.
12323,Why?
12324,Because the point is to reduce the spread of contagions.

12573,"asymptomatic now usually means ""truly"" asymptomatic in the literature."
12574,"Wouldn't believe a ""seroprevalence"" study until it's explained how tests from 2019 are coming back seriously positive."
12575,I believe the antibody test has some serious cross reactivity.
12576,Where's your source for influenza IFR?
12577,Doesn't seem to me that a reliable estimate even exists.
12578,The ranges are huge.
12579,"In which case it will probably just get added to the flu shot, same as H1N1 was."
12580,"Thanks, Gov."
12581,I wouldnt get on a plane if I have the rona.
12582,Exactly.
12583,"There is also a question of what it means for the vaccine to ""work."""
12584,"It might prevent symptomatic covid for 6 months or a year, but prevent severe cases for many years."
12585,We just don't know.
12586,if it happened anytime from Feb onwards anyone with half a brain would know it was going to be a mess for at least months (and probably much more) to come with the pandemic.
12587,I am not dictating anything.

12592,I had COVID in July.
12593,I had slight congestion and a persistent headache for like 2 days.
12594,Then all felt well.
12595,"It was a couple days later I noticed coffee didn’t really have a good flavor, and this amazing sandwich we got seemed rather empty to me."
12596,"It was only after we passed a burning car, and an emergency bathroom break at a random gas station where my son (5) loudly voiced his questions about the putrid smell, that I realized."
12597,(I had a test scheduled ASAP...but that was like 5 days away.
12598,Testing was scarce and reservations were required.)
12599,My desire for my favorites plummeted.
12600,"Taste and smell returned over probably 4 weeks, but even today they’re still not 100%."
12601,"During that initial regain, coffee was DISGUSTING."
12602,"You don’t know me, but I love coffee."
12603,"Like, expensive espresso machine, freshly roasted beans always, expensive burr grinder...the works."
12604,It was about a week of smelling this absolutely revolting scent before I could stomach it.
12605,Peanut butter also had a particularly gnarly smell.
12606,It was like musty cigarette smoke mixed with the scents used to try and mask the smoke smell.
12607,"Oddly specific, but it reminds me heavily of my mom’s car."
12608,"Finally, maybe over the last month, it no longer smells like that, but I still struggle to eat it."
12609,I used it to eat it nearly every day.
12610,Body odor and gas are an odd one.
12611,"They’re very noticeable to me, but not to others."
12612,I put on deodorant and I wreak.
12613,I’ve asked my wife multiple times and she says I smell good.
12614,The mix of deodorant and my bo is putrid to me.
12615,"Funny enough, when the deodorant wears off, I now think I smell fine and my wife tells me other wise."
12616,Antiperspirant seems to mitigate this.
12617,"Sewage, my dog’s business in the back yard, my dog rolling around in the dirt, and my own bathroom trips also produce a very similar smell, whereas before they were quite distinct."
12618,"They’re also very strong, but I don’t think it’s that bad in reality."
12619,"Anyway, I do hope your wife and mother regain their ability to smell and taste."
12620,They’re probably in for a long recovery.
12621,Not as many as I would expect for something that has a major impact on billions of people's lives every single day.
12622,Don't feel stupid.
12623,"Yes, most people will recover, but some don't."
12624,I'm not worried about dying.
12625,I'm worried about long covid.
12626,Scan the r/covidlonghaulers sub.
12627,"Lots of young, healthy people who are dealing with crazy, debilitating post viral syndrome."

12652,I never said people should die of the virus.
12653,Who said that?
12654,Nobody.
12655,Stop making up fake arguments.
12656,I said it would be dystopian to make it globally illegal to not wear a mask.
12657,Period.
12658,Do you disagree?
12659,First one is free...
12660,"Reality is so much fucking worse...

&gt;The man who died submitted a “ready-to-fly” checklist that said he had not been diagnosed with covid-19 and did not have symptoms."
12661,But the family later confirmed he had been feeling sick as they prepared to travel; his wife told medical workers on board that he had lost his sense of taste and smell
12662,Did it ever occur to you that perfectly rational people will refuse a vaccine?
12663,The logic is simple.
12664,The current vaccines in America are under an emergency use license and the companies have immunity from law suits.
12665,You could potential tell me I am an idiot for refusing to take a vaccine.
12666,I am fine with that.
12667,I would rather wait and see what these vaccines do.
12668,Show me the clinical data?
12669,"If it hasn't been cherry picked dry by government thugs to make money, I'd be surprised."
12670,Dr. Fauci is an idiot.

12672,Time to move on.
12673,Its 1000 bucks here.
12674,interesting how your comments always have a similar number of upvotes :)
12675,Because they couldn't work if they tested positive.

12685,"Numerous public health bodies recommend closing down restaurants too, sooooo..."
12686,There's evidence that 6 FT is not sufficient.
12687,Since when is it dystopian to not want everyone to die from a fucking virus?
12688,!
12689,Do you plan on locking up all those who don’t wear masks?
12690,Do you want to overcrowd jails and prisons and artificially inflate COVID cases?

12726,ND is legitimately fucking nuts.
12727,Nearly one in every **eight** people has been a confirmed case.
12728,More than one in every 600 people in the state have died from COVID-19.
12729,"What's interesting is that they're daily cases have dropped dramatically from a peak of over 2,000 in mid-November to a low of just over 100 today."
12730,"Their test positivity is about 5% right now; not low, but not crazy high either."
12731,"With seroprevalence suggesting actual infectious to be several times greater than confirmed cases, I genuinely wonder if they're getting close to herd immunity."

The impact of the new &amp; more infectious strain has not been explained well in the press."
12808,Via Tomas Pueyo.
12809,"Just some headlines, more is included at his link below:

- If countries had a hard time stopping it before, they will have a much much harder time now."
12810,"If it’s 60% more infectious, R0 has gone from 2.7 to ~4.3 on average."
12811,- We just went from herd immunity reached at ~60% of the population (through vaccines or recoveries) to reaching it at ~75-80%.
12812,-  It also means a delay in herd immunity from vaccines.
12813,"If a country with 10% of the pop recovered expected to vaccinate 5% of the population per month, immunity would be reached in ~ September."
12814,Now it would take until ~Dec 2021-Jan 2022.
12815,- it also means a longer time before the economic recovery.
12816,And a deeper recession.
12817,- it’s a bit like a new pandemic.
12818,"It will take time before it’s everywhere

- Some vaccines might become nearly useless."
12819,A vaccine with 70% effectiveness (Eg Oxford) could have been useful if we only needed 60% of the pop to be immune.
12820,"But if we need 75%, even if we vaccinated 100% (impossible) it might still not stop the epidemic."

12839,"But remember, this name was given for two reasons - firstly because it is just so darn similar to SARS-COV-1 (SARS from 2002) and also because initially symptoms were thought to be limited to respiratory symptoms - coughing, sore throat, pneumonia (and associated fever)."

&gt;Saliva plays major roles in human-to-human transmission of the SARS-CoV-2."
13065,"Recently we reported that black, green and oolong tea significantly inactivated SARS-CoV-2 within 1 min."
13066,"Theaflavin-3,3'-di-gallate (TFDG), theasinensin A (TSA) and (-) epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG) were involved in the anti-viral activities."
13067,Here we examined how long period is required for the compounds to inactivate the virus.
13068,We also assessed whether tea inactivates SARS-CoV-2 diluted in human saliva.
13069,"Treatment of SARS-CoV-2 with 500 μM TFDG or TSA for 10 sec reduced the virus titer to undetectable levels (less than 1/1,000)."
13070,Black and green tea decreased virus titer to less than 1/100 within 10 sec even in saliva.
13071,"These findings suggest a possibility that intake of, or gargling with, tea may inactivate SARS-CoV-2 in saliva in infected individuals, which may eventually attenuate spread of COVID-19 within a population, although clinical studies are required to test this hypothesis by determining the intensity and duration of the anti-viral effect of tea in saliva in humans."

13191,Virus mutate very quickly.
13192,"As soon as the host cell dies and rips apart, thousands of new viruses come out that cell ready to infect other cells and continue that trend, so new mutations are happening every time they infect a new cell."
13193,There may be hundred of new strains.
13194,There are 52 weeks in a year.
13195,We now believe 85-90% inoculation is required for herd immunity.
13196,"So, (330 \* 0.9) / 52 = 5.7 million a week."
13197,"So, yeah, rounded up we need 10 million a week as a goal and assume 40% can't/won't get vaccinated."
13198,"Was working an open loader at dusk and a bat decided to dive through the headlights for bugs, nailing me in the shoulder."
13199,Didn't hurt but apparently those things can scratch you and you hardly feel it.
13200,Don't forget the yeast!
13201,For uh... bread.
13202,Are we great again yet?
13203,Definitely not in the west.
13204,"Many eastern countries have definitely already learned from respiratory virus outbreaks in the past, and their behavior and numbers show."
13205,"The delusion, ignorance, and self-absorption of people who can rationalize a comparison between receiving a vaccine and actually signing-up to fight in WW2... 

“Come on, maaaan.” *Joe Biden voice*"
13206,"Is it really ignorant to assume such a thing when your doctor-to-person ratio is a third of the UK's, which is one of the worst in Europe?"
13207,I'm so ready to see all the doomers embrace totalitarianism because muh flu.
13208,"like i said, the methods china implemented WERE effective."
13209,it cant be denied.
13210,"but if you report 1000+ new deaths in a day, they literally dont stop immediately the next day."
13211,"you referenced that the numbers of infections went down, which is true."
13212,"however, i am not talking about case numbers, but deaths."
13213,"even if cases go down, deaths cant stop at a brick wall if the previous day showed 1000+."
13214,"china didnt report new deaths after that day, and corona doesnt stop killing people."
13215,china quite obviously fudged their numbers.
13216,"also, i live in a well-doing european state where masks and one round of harsh lockdowns was enough to keep our deaths under 700. there was no need to weld people into their apartment buildings."
13217,I'm a bit concerned.
13218,I checked what 28 days would be after my first Moderna inoculation yesterday and it falls on a day I'm scheduled for a procedure (colonoscopy).
13219,Would I be able to have the procedure and get the second shot or should I cancel the procedure?
13220,"Yeah, I believe they're the only 2 states to have done away with religious exemptions for childhood vaccinations."
13221,I was super surprised to learn that.
13222,Glad COVID vaccination rollout is going well in WV.
13223,"On the ground report from NJ, we have a distribution center but it is not getting activity."
13224,I am not sure exactly why but have had local post of volunteers and people going there and saying it is nearly empty.
13225,I think they invited people who are in health care and people over 60 to make appointments to get the vaccine.
13226,They converted an empty Sears store.
13227,It seems like maybe the elderly are not jumping quickly on the opportunity to go get the vaccine as they are pretty secure in their homes.
13228,"My impression is they should consider opening it more quickly to people who work in service industries like restaurant workers or retail workers, if the elderly are not beating down the doors to get it."
13229,Would you want to balance the most vulnerable with the most likely to be exposed or transmit the virus.
13230,But this gets into the counter intuitive ethical problems.
13231,Plus how do you verify categories.
13232,Elderly can be identified by age on an ID.
13233,I am not sure how they identify health care workers.
13234,You’re essential my friend.
13235,That you and your team claim otherwise isn’t relevant.
13236,"It does vary by state, but in my state people in your position are in the group after front line essentials but still way before most other people."
13237,The goal is to get critical sectors back up and running at full capacity.
13238,Ha ha😏
13239,BioNTech is a German company
13240,My joints ached.
13241,No fever tho.
13242,&gt;Not sure what we’re gonna do but the OR is the next logical place to put them.
13243,"That's what happened in NYC in April: ORs were converted to ""ORICUs"" and anesthesia machines were repurposed as ventilators."
13244,"NY did not cancel all elective surgery very early, like mid March."
13245,Here for citizens it was about $1200 fine plus some jail time.
13246,for people from outside the country (work/ students visas..) they go to prison for 3 month and are refused entrance to the country for good.
13247,This was a poorly worded headline.
13248,"Title should read ""Covid infected 10 times higher than cases""."
13249,"I can't believe this late on the pandemic, journos still confuse number of cases with number of infected."
13250,"The former is a precise number requiring testing or some clinical assessment, the later is a epidemiological estimate, based on different methodologies."
13251,"Well, this guy has survived quite a lot of gaffes before."
13252,"He is obviously incompetent, yet manages to stay in power."
13253,Perhaps the teflon effect will work again.
13254,"Don't forget Desantis, Yale BA, Harvard JD,."
13255,JAG prosecutor.
13256,"Exactly, everything they said is way easier said than done."
13257,I wouldn’t be ashamed.
13258,You’re allowed to modify and set up your car to meet needs or wants however you want.
13259,That’s part of the (often fun or rewarding) part in having your own car
13260,"As per the cdc, 268k/290k deaths have been of age 55+."
13261,That’s 92%.
13262,"233k are 65+

Turns out I was right on the money at 80% (I just estimated originally)


https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nvss/vsrr/covid_weekly/index.htm"
13263,Actually they had evidence it existed but they didn’t share it.
13264,I'm enrolled in the AZ vaccine trial.
13265,what are the confirmed cases in third world countries?
13266,and can we achieve world herd immunity when multiple 1st world countries reach herd immunity?
13267,Even at 100 million people that can only be achieved by vaccinating 25-30 million people per month...or dispensing 50-60 million vaccinations per month accounting for the second shot.
13268,In order to hit target we'll have to be vaccinating people at roughly 10-25x our current rate.
13269,Also important to note that as we vaccinate more people participation will decrease.
13270,The people who need/want it most are at the front of the line in their respective categories.
13271,"When we need to ramp vaccinations up the most, the people we need to vaccinate will become increasingly difficult to find."
13272,That’s only a trueism whilst elderly people are legally allowed to mix with general society.
13273,The risk factors for the 60-70 year range are still very low.
13274,It’s not until after 70 it becomes in relative terms a big risk.
13275,"Which is exactly why this demographic should not be leaving homes to go to their local town, to the supermarket, to the coffee shop."
13276,Face facts.
13277,"Lockdown for the general population would not be necessary if high risk individuals were legally confined to their home until vaccination programmes were complete, and only allowed to reside/mix/physically socialise with similar category individuals."
13278,I was enrolled into the AZ vaccine trial back in November
13279,You have to homeschool?
13280,There’s no online school where you’re from?
13281,Operation First Gear
13282,Lets hope we learn some lessons from this..... or from the looks of it.... not.
13283,Not everyone who refuses the vaccine is an anti-masker.
13284,Some folks are immunocompromised
13285,Yeah at least they make it really obvious haha.
13286,"The same thing happens in r/sino, I think it’s a few people with multiple accounts"
13287,"Not sure what this had to do with ""Canada""."
13288,Every country on Earth that is dealing with a resurgence is dealing with an overwhelmed Healthcare system...who is supposed to be administering vaccines when we are lockdown and even doctors offices and pharmacies have strict occupancy limits in place?
13289,Can someone please explain where these massive crowds are supposed to congregate to be vaccinated and which overworked and exhausted Healthcare worker is supposed to administer it?
13290,"Canada ordered a lot of vaccines, right?"
13291,Us europeans will fall short on vaccines tho
13292,"From a German Newspaper:

“Spahn referred in the ZDF ""Morgenmagazin"" to a plant of the Swiss pharmaceutical company Novartis in Marburg, which was taken over by the Mainz-based company BioNTech."
13293,"""The goal is to also make production possible there before the end of February/March."
13294,"And that would increase the volume enormously,"" the CDU politician said."
13295,"According to Biontech, some changeovers are needed in Marburg before production of the Covid-19 vaccine can start there as well."
13296,"This should start in February, a spokeswoman for the company told dpa."
13297,The company is reportedly targeting the end of March for the release of the first vaccine produced there.
13298,"In the first half of 2021, 250 million vaccine doses are to be produced there."
13299,"The Mainz-based company is aiming for 750 million doses as the total volume of an annual production.”

Translated with www.DeepL.com/Translator (free version)"
13300,Trivago
13301,The goal got moved to the end of first week of January.
13302,So this article doesn’t matter much.
13303,And yet Sweden has had only 5.86 percent more excess deaths  of all causes than Norway.
13304,Quite the discrepancy.
13305,What do you think is the cause of that?
13306,To clarify: this means that for example restaurant owners and managers have to take responsibility that their staff and customers are wearing masks.
13307,"Haha I love how conservatives think anything to the left of OANN is ""CNN""."
13308,Some of is actually give credence to more than 1-2 outlets that tells us what we want to hear.
13309,The virus and the news has shown us over the course of 2020 what people are made of.
13310,You're willing to back fascism and oppose science because you want immigrants to be evil?
13311,Or are you more obsessed with abortion (while ignoring war crimes)?
13312,"Why did your family ""lose everything?"""
13313,"Which covid hotbed did you choose to live in, which contrary to statistics, your family will swear is safer than whichever backwoods red part of CA they'd found to live in?"
13314,"I'm sure the reason they left isn't just some vague complaint about ""government overreach""."
13315,Sweedish company has invented a vaccine against careeriside?
13316,/S
13317,"https://medicalxpress.com/news/2020-12-antibody-covid-reliable-immunity.html

Here's a further article I found on it."
13318,"Seems like they give a reliable analysis on every single antibody in your body, so it's not only related to corona but can be used for anyone who doesn't know which viruses they have antibodies for."
13319,&gt;simply gave a full vial (5 doses) to each of them.
13320,To add to this:  A dose is 0.3mL containing 0.06mL of the vaccine.
13321,Each vial contains 0.45mL undiluted vaccine.
13322,"You need to add 1.8mL sodium chloride injection to it and end up with 2.25mL ready to inject, which the label says is good for 5 doses, the latest updated fda guideline says 6 doses is correct, and if you manage to get a 7th dose out of that it is fine too."
13323,(2.25/0.3=7.5doses); it depends on the dead-space in the syringe you use.
13324,This event happend in a vaccination team that was put together from people who never worked together before.
13325,Such teams are set up in all of germany to go nursing home to nursing home.
13326,"The doctor who administered the doses said he don't even knows the full name of the nurse who prepared the syringes, and that there was no training other than just only a couple printed papers."
13327,source: pay2read physical newspaper Ostsee-Zeitung.
13328,Sound like that nurse just filled the syringes with undiluted vials.
13329,"Side note:  The Moderna vaccine does not need dilution, it is ready to apply on delivery."
13330,Knowing when to transition to lesser at-risk populations is one reason.
13331,Knowing which states are administering the vaccine correctly (to the right groups) and if the distribution between states needs to be altered would be another reason.
13332,10 million a month is nowhere near enough.
13333,We need to be vaccinating 10 million a week.
13334,There are 330 million people in the U.S.
13335,I don’t know why you’re being down voted.
13336,There is no national plan.
13337,"Federalism has a few upsides, but this is not one of them."
13338,Imagine if we were at war and we just told each of the 50 states to send their own troops and handle it on their own without any coordination or logistics from the federal government.
13339,&gt; Many people get severe illness and need the hospital for treatment.
13340,What’s the hospitalization rate for non-elderly people with no pre existing conditions?
13341,Pretty sure it’s quite low.
13342,Once the vulnerable are vaccinated I find it unlikely that hospitals (whose staff will all be vaccinated as well so they’ll be better staffed) are overwhelmed.
13343,Also Boeing or someone did a study and found no risk of infection during air travel.
13344,"https://www.propublica.org/article/leaked-documents-show-how-chinas-army-of-paid-internet-trolls-helped-censor-the-coronavirus

This should explain where the downvotes are coming from."
13345,"The others did so too (Pfizer asked for approval in the UK/US before EU, Moderna the same with Canada/US/UK and then the EU)."
13346,I can only speculate.
13347,Maybe it's because they use emergency approval while the EU has conditional approval which is more stringent.
13348,Maybe they simply don't care that much about the EU.
13349,Perhaps they EMA requires different data sets.
13350,I'm actually curious too.
13351,It wouldn't make sense to delay without reason.
13352,The White House actually went through with their holiday party?
13353,Goddamn
13354,K
13355,"Over promise, under deliver, then call everyone liars."
13356,"Democratic state governors like Coumo explicitly said they would ""stop"" any Federal distribution of vaccines in their states."

13369,I thought conservatives believe in holding people accountable.
13370,They always say how poor people should get a job and how if you give someone money they will squander it.
13371,So why aren’t these same conservatives saying you need to be held accountable for your own health choices?

13385,"It's not scary, really."
13386,Permafrost has been melting for the last 18000 years since the last ice age peaked.
13387,Not much has changed in that perspective.
13388,I also wonder how many new old viruses can there be.
13389,After all the area has not seen a lot of animals in its history.
13390,"It has been a cold and desolate world unable to support big animal populations for millions of years, enough time to grind even viruses to smaller molecules."
13391,"My guess is that probability of getting a new old disease with severe pandemic capability from melting permafrost is many decades smaller than such disease developing in places where we have plenty of living organisms, such as tropical forests, farms and cities."
13392,Lol I’m American but living in Vietnam.
13393,"I remember when people were claiming VN was lying for having no deaths (it’s 35 now), so I think in general people have realized how you don’t have to be a “developed” country to have an effective response to contain the virus."
13394,Well worth the read.
13395,"Even though this article goes two directions at once, it's very good at both of them."
13396,It gives a reasonable forecast for this pandemic and talks about how it teaches us about preparing for the next one.
13397,Hospitals pay double not insurers.
13398,There are programs in rural communities to waive student loans AND make bank.
13399,Please don't let the first dose give you a false sense of security.
13400,"The vaccine takes time for it to work, it takes time for most of the population to get vaccinated, and some vaccines require more than one dose."
13401,That 20% still need time to become immune.
13402,About 98 or so percent of the population still can get infected.
13403,Well I could lie about my everyday lives by taking descriptions directly from US news if that makes you happy.
13404,Why should I do it?
13405,Would you trust me as just a random internet person (or not even person) if I say so?

If you notice from this chart published by FT, countries that controlled this - South Korea, Iceland, Australia, and Taiwan had lower excess mortality, largely because lockdowns and fewer people driving/going outside reduced deaths from accidents while COVID deaths were fairly negligible."

13557,I don’t think they’re lying so much as they were dealing with a novel virus and likely weren’t catching all the cases and deaths in the beginning.
13558,So yeah there were probably more deaths back in winter and spring but seeing that their testing capability is among the best it’s safe to say those numbers are accurate now.
13559,No one believes you care about the Uighurs.
13560,Stop concern trolling.

13569,Though I did found [this youtube video](https://youtu.be/izbJmVhAMCk) that showed starvation deaths from 1900 to 2019.
13570,I stopped the video at 2019 and calculated the deaths from that year (from each country) and the result I got was around 5.5 million deaths.
13571,I then went to this website that shows starvation deaths from this year and it's almost 9 million.
13572,Has starvation globally really increased by 3 million in one year?

13694,Initial estimates in early Spring 2020 were that numbers were  under-reported by a factor of 10-14 times.
13695,Countries that controlled the pandemic ended up with lower excess deaths due to mitigation measures reducing deaths from other causes.

13791,This article is currently at 6808 in queue and I don’t have time to wait for it.
13792,Maybe someone else will get it faster.
13793,Sorry.
13794,But it’s not impossible to do either.
13795,"Inconvenient, yeah, 100%."
13796,"I’m sick and tired of wearing masks, but out of looking out for one another, especially considering we are so near the end, it’s not out of the question either."
13797,But this goes back to what I’ve always said: You do what you feel is right.
13798,Oh god my pneumonia vaccine kicked my ass.
13799,"I had a 102 fever, vomited a couple of times, my arm swelled up and turned bright red and I couldn’t move it for a week..."
13800,I was so sick my doctor sent me out for a Covid test which came back negative.
13801,It was miserable.
13802,I’d still rather go through that again than get Covid though
13803,So which outlets would you suggest then?
13804,"The Daily mail, Breitbart and Trump’s Twitter feed?"
13805,"That is just horrible, cruel treatment."
13806,I am so sorry.
13807,That too 😂
13808,"If it's any indication of how things would go based on this pandemic, America will be screwed and China will be fine"
13809,I’m sorry you reacted this way.
13810,"My point is only that policies should be intelligent, and looking at the right’s response, doing more of the same would only further escalate what is already happening on the US-American right."
13811,What was Einstein’s whole spiel?
13812,Insanity is doing the same thing and expecting different results?
13813,"Yeah, when they can't hide it anymore."
13814,It's been a year already and now we hear this?
13815,!
13816,Give it 3 months.
13817,California will end up with more per capita and an economy in shambles.
13818,"Three times is likely an undercount in Russia *and* the US, and other places."
13819,"It’s going to take a while to un-fuck the numbers that have been deliberately fucked since February, but they will be roughly."
13820,"For example, new data suggests China underreported by a factor of 10 times."
13821,Initial estimates in early Spring 2020 were that numbers were under-reported by a factor of 10-14 times.
13822,As a non American...
13823,I just assumed people still got unemployment insurance pay if they couldn't work?
13824,I know there was a stimulus pay but I thought that was Stimulating the economy.
13825,Did people really go this long without anything?
13826,Hello.
13827,This is a perfectly valid question.
13828,"I think that, culturally, some people see wearing masks as a hardship and something that is imposed on them by the government due to the pandemic."
13829,"For others, the mask has raised awareness of the viruses we breathe out pretty much always."
13830,"You can see that Asian countries tend to wear masks normally,  possibly as they have been scarred by previous epidemics."
13831,I don't know what I will do.
13832,I only know that strsngers breathing in my face is not an attractive prospect pandemic or not.
13833,On a serious note is there any study detailing the side  effects of this vaccines.
13834,I really would like to read that.
13835,Funny thing but if the health care system was not profit-driven rural doctors could be paid way more and people might prefer these posts.
13836,"And now that they're officially using excess death statistics to get at the real number, where's your criticism for everyone who doesn't use similar methodology?"
13837,"Objectively, countries that still refuse to do so are now lying more than Russia."

13851,I’m not sure if you’re trolling or what.
13852,When a pandemic is over it means the threat is gone.
13853,No one other than those that want to are going to be mask wearing past this summer
13854,So if you have to wait 28 days between shots can you be infected after the first shot while waiting for the second?
13855,How are those lockdowns going for you guys by the way?
13856,"We haven't had lockdowns in my state since May, and were able to celebrate Christmas without fear of being forcibly quarantined."
13857,Maybe they will have to start dumping bodies onto the streets to get people to start taking precautions to avoid spreading COVID-19.
13858,Millions of people are still doing holiday celebrations and leisure travel.
13859,"3,000 new deaths a day still isn't noticeable."
13860,Utter nonsense.
13861,A couple of points.
13862,"Firstly, it wouldn’t be 20-30% under lockdown."
13863,Nowhere near this.
13864,"Secondly, a good percentage of those under home lockdown are in the main, outside of groceries, energy costs and a tv subscription, widely economically inactive."
13865,You don’t get pensioners dropping €10k on a nice new watch.
13866,"They sit at home and eat food, waiting pretty much for the pearly gates."
13867,You are treating over 60 lockdown as a binary response.
13868,It wouldn’t be.
13869,"Firstly, there will be a large number of working age over 60 that can work from home."
13870,Many would be re-deployable from high risk workplace areas to lower risk.
13871,"The actual fatality rate doesn’t start to go exponential until you are in your 70s, so, whilst you may have a higher risk of death from coronavirus than an RTA, the risk is still minuscule."
13872,"In terms of economic activity, an utter myth."
13873,"Firstly, if we had let this virus rip, we would already be at equilibrium by august, assuming exponential growth rates."
13874,Pandemic over.
13875,"Secondly, the U.K. saw the worst contraction in 300 years, not due to reduced demand, but by businesses being legally prevented from conducting their business."
13876,It is an utter fallacy that a widespread pandemic is suppressing demand.
13877,"If it were, why are governments forcibly closing access to pubs, clubs and bars?"
13878,"Is it that demand is so poor that they may as well, or is it that the demand is there, despite a pandemic, and people actually don’t really care?"
13879,"Finally, on overloaded hospital beds."
13880,"the young wouldn’t be denied beds, because very low chance of recovery geriatrics would have been triaged out of the system well before it ever got to that."
13881,"What is being done is wanton, reckless destruction of livelihoods, the cost of which SAGE in the U.K. have put at ten times the cost in QALY Terms than that saved by preventing vulnerable, aged, end of their days geriatrics from dying."
13882,Government response has been driven by uneducated public hysteria and not the science.
13883,"There hasn’t been a single case in history of humanity where the level of economic destruction wrought has been done for such a low lethality disease, which globally the WHO have confirmed is running at around 0.2% for every infection."
13884,"Only 2.5% of all global deaths are as a result of Covid, we are treating it like it’s actually 50%+."
13885,"\&gt;implying everyone can afford internet

\&gt;implying everyone can afford an internet-compatible device

pretty sure the bus is cheaper"
13886,Because it will still help with the people who haven't been infected.
13887,AFTER the pandemic?
13888,Yeah right.
13889,I should have clarified that I have no understanding of the political landscape of South Africa and I’m only talking about the US
13890,"Honestly, listening to the total disregard for rules and not staying at home from friends I have living in South Africa is shocking."
13891,"Still taking flights to see family, doing trips between provinces."
13892,"It's just like no one there understands the severity, or cares enough about it."
13893,It's already gone off the rails in the US.
13894,"In October, OWS said 100 million would be vaccinated by the end of 2020, then that was revised down to 40 million, then to 20 million."
13895,So far we've vaccinated just over 2 million.

13900,Is he very popular bc I've only heard of him appearing at Trump's rally.
13901,I agree with you.
13902,But my point is laws like this wouldn’t make them comply more.
13903,Gavin Shitturd Newsom trying to take credit for this...
13904,Just because it doesn’t restrict your breathing doesn’t make it not true for others.
13905,Masks aren’t gonna become like pants despite this anti social subs’ hope they will be.

Well..."
13909,They do say they don't know if the vaccine will protect you from bringing the virus forward.
13910,So vaccinating health care workers doesn't guarantee that they protect high risk patients.
13911,So... High risk patients first.
13912,Why healthy 45 year olds come before health care workers is beyond me and its quite upsetting.
13913,They still transport cardiac arrests in LA?
13914,That's not a thing in a lot of places now in CA.
13915,bragging about living in Florida is just damned sad.
13916,You have shit completely backwards about covid too.

13918,"Then again, people like you are in a cult so the best I can hope for here is to shame you publicly."
13919,I'm thinking of the inclusion criteria.
13920,"From the links above, the Brazil trial only included ""Healthcare professionals who work in direct contact care of people with possible or confirmed COVID-19 cases"", while the Turkey trial has two cohorts: high-risk healthcare professionals and others with the numbers being mostly people in ""normal risk"" or non-healthcare professionals (1,300 vs 11,000)."
13921,"With healthcare professionals having much greater risk for severe COVID-19, I wonder if this can explain the difference in results."
13922,"https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/healthcare-workers-7-times-as-likely-to-have-severe-covid-19-as-other-workers?c=602089584888

If so, a scenario where countries spend more money on purchasing Pfizer/Moderna doses for their healthcare workforce and the more affordable but less effective AstraZeneca/Sinovac doses for the public seems like a feasible option."
13923,"There was a funny post I saw on twitter (don't have the source) which said something along the lines of:

13962,It’s clear you are “getting into” whoever matches your thinking at the moment.
13963,Take a breath and rethink your motivations.
13964,What's their logic behind that?
13965,"Here in Maryland:

Restaurants are closed in most Counties."
13966,Including those hardest hit by COVID.
13967,Prince George’s County Restaurants are fully Closed.
13968,"As are most places like Bowling Alleys, Theaters, and Arcades."
13969,HOWEVER— Casinos are open.
13970,You can go into a casino...
13971,Sit at a Poker Table with 7 other random people.
13972,"In Poker, you physically handle the same cards— and the same chips— as they are reshuffled and dealt over and over again."
13973,You bet chips.
13974,You win the pot.
13975,You get all the chips bet and handled by other players.
13976,"You then bet, and fold or lose, and all those chips pass to another player."
13977,Round and round we go.
13978,It’s a song and dance of touching the cards and touching the chips.
13979,Pushing the chips into one big “Pot”.
13980,Then pushing that pot of chips to the Winner.
13981,Cards are collected.
13982,Shuffled.
13983,And dealt over and over again.
13984,The chips and cards are literally passed player to player 40-50 times per hour in poker.
13985,In a given hour 2-3 players will leave... their seats filled with new players.
13986,But as far as eating out.
13987,God forbid you sit in a booth at a restaurant at 25% capacity.
13988,3 empty booths in between you and the next couple.
13989,NO JOKE.

13991,Chips are literally germ magnets.
13992,They are dirty as f$ck.
13993,However casinos were the FIRST to reopen after shutdown.
13994,They have remained open-since.
13995,Why?
13996,The state gets HUGE kick backs from the casinos profit.
13997,Millions of dollars.
13998,Health and Safety is not the primary concern.

14035,"With how confusing they are making this vaccine, I highly doubt many people would take it over Pfizer and Moderna."
14036,"Or you can use the ""German way"": Be the country where the first approved vaccine was developed, but agree to let the EU manage vaccine procurement."
14037,"Then look at EU being very pennywise and eventually notice that you won't get enough vaccines early on (but at least you will have to pay a few bucks less), so you put in your own order, but that won't be delivered any time soon either."
14038,Meanwhile all the good stuff that was developed in Germany and produced in Belgium is getting flown out to the US (even though US has lots of Moderna and won't give a lot of Moderna to Europe) and UK.

14092,"Like remember when Redfield said we could stop this ""if everyone just"" wore masks for X weeks?"
14093,What was that about?
14094,"Never what type of masks, or what settings."
14095,Just vague statements like that with absolutely zero science behind it.
14096,And I feel like a lot of the left doesn't want to question it because doing so is seen as insensitive.
14097,Which may well be in large part because we've had an insensitive jackass for president for the past four years.
14098,"And for every action, there is an equal reaction."
14099,"So even as ridiculous as we get, I'm trying to remember that we're not the ones spinning conspiracy theories and dismissing science because ""the liberal media is in control of everything""."

14103,Then I think it differs based upon the doctors that you talk to.
14104,It is reported to the CDC as a new infection.
14105,They keep statistics but they don't necessarily tie it to a name like they will with some of the other diseases.
14106,however your medical records do have it tied to you therefore it is tracked and there's a good chance that Equifax has that information in one of their many fucked up databases.

14145,Closed.
14146,Period.

14148,Casinos are open.
14149,You can go into a casino.
14150,Sit at a Poker Table with 7 other random people.
14151,And physically handle the same cards and the same chips as they are reshuffled and dealt over and over again.
14152,You bet chips.

14160,Chips are literally germ magnets.
14161,However casinos were the first to reopen and have remained open.
14162,Why?

Yes, but we also already knew this."
14173,"It's due to limited supplies:

&gt;The timing of priming and booster vaccine administration **varied between studies**."
14174,"As protocol amendments to add a booster dose took place when the trials were underway, and owing to the time taken to manufacture and release a new batch of vaccine, **doses could not be administered at a 4-week interval**."
14175,"1459 (53·2%) of 2741 participants in COV002 in the LD/SD group received a second dose at least 12 weeks after the first (median 84 days, IQR 77—91) and only 22 (0·8%) received a second dose within 8 weeks of the first."

14203,It may very well be that you’re generally vulnerable a year or two on (or less).
14204,I think it’s probably smarter to plan to vaccinate every adult and end up with too much than to bank on the unknown and end up with too little.

14241,"**The government wants to be able to get the right to introduce oral protection requirements in, among other things, public transport and shopping centers."
14242,"** **Today, there is no legal possibility to do so."
14243,"**

Oral protection has been a controversial issue in Sweden, which has long been one of the few countries that has had neither requirements nor recommendations for wearing a mask."
14244,"The Swedish Public Health Agency has long claimed that oral protection does not belong in the Swedish strategy, but just before Christmas the authority announced that the protection should be recommended in public transport during rush hour from 7 January."
14245,"**There is currently** no legal possibility to require people to wear masks, either on the street or in public transport."
14246,But the proposal for a pandemic law that is now to be examined by the Law Council contains an opportunity to demand that people have protection over their mouths and noses in certain contexts.
14247,"The text of the law states that ""other measures to prevent the spread of infection"", in addition to, among other things, limiting opening hours and the number of visitors, must be able to be introduced at trade venues, public events and public gatherings, in public transport and at private gatherings."
14248,"The Government writes in the Law Council's referral that it does not want to legislate on a specific list of infection control measures, but that such a measure could be to require oral protection."
14249,"**Sofia Brändström,** press secretary to the Minister of Social Affairs Lena Hallengren (S), writes to DN:

“The regulations that may be issued on the basis of the law may entail requirements for other measures to prevent the spread of infection."
14250,"Such a requirement may, for example, be that the participants at, for example, a public gathering or public event must wear masks. """
14251,"Requirements for mouth protection must also be able to be introduced in public transport and on domestic flights, in leisure and cultural activities, at trade venues and places for private gatherings, Brändström states."
14252,\- The places that are regulated in the law will be able to be regulated with a mouth protection requirement.
14253,"But it is not certain that this will be the case, she says."
14254,"**If the law enters** into force, it will be the government or another authority that is given the right to write a regulation on oral protection requirements."
14255,"In the bill, the government writes that it wants it to be up to the operator to ensure that people wear masks - and not to the individual."
14256,“The Government considers that the proposed authorizations should be designed so that it will be the operator who will ensure that the requirement is complied with.
14257,"The law does not provide support for introducing a regulation on requirements for the use of masks that is aimed at everyone in society "", it is stated in the legal advice."
14258,"Karin Åhman, an expert in public law at Stockholm University and co-author of a consultation response on the law, interprets it as meaning that the oral protection requirement should be linked to other infection control measures."
14259,"\- The government may not give general rules on oral protection, but they can add it to regulations if they deem it necessary."
14260,"It could, for example, be that a store can have 50 visitors if they wear masks, she tells DN."
14261,**Lena Hallengren presented** the new bill on Monday.
14262,The government hopes that it will enter into force on 10 January.
14263,"With the law, the government wants, among other things, the right to close shopping centers and other activities that do not follow the rules."
14264,"\- Lena Hallengren says that mouth protection should not be a political issue, but it should be decided by our expert authority."
14265,"The Swedish Public Health Agency has previously announced that mouth protection can be a complement if distance cannot be maintained, says Sofia Brändström, press secretary to the Minister of Social Affairs Lena Hallengren."

14270,We'll see...
14271,A virus that kills the host is less likely to spread over a long period of time.
14272,"For survival of the virus, its more beneficial to evolve to be more contagious and less symptomatic."
14273,"This is helpful, but it does not provide insight into what is actually being measured by this test (the measurand)."
14274,"Is it IgG, IgM, or a larger panel of antibodies/immunoglobulins?"
14275,"From this additional article, it appears that the the data about the person's immune system is being obtain by serial tests over a period of time:  


""By collecting data on the quantity and quality of antibodies in a sample and then comparing these with samples taken at a later time, an immunity development profile can be established""  


This is something that is already being done with the more common IgG/IgM rapid tests."
14276,"Without knowing the measurand, it is not possible to draw any further conclusions about the impact of the new platform in this article."
14277,"While the binary IgG and IgM tests on the market are not intended for quantitation, there is an intensity component to the output."
14278,"A system like this one has value as there is a chance that it can be a high throughput platform, however I have yet to see anything to support the notion that this new device will provide an additional tool to combat the pandemic being another test on the market."
14279,"Of course, I would be delighted to be wrong."
14280,Thanks for the reply.
14281,Confused because I know someone that had the virus recently posting photos of her getting the vaccine
14282,How will you be able to discern those with auto immune disorders that can't take vaccines?
14283,Or will they get special labels as well to stitch on their clothes?
14284,This is where we are heading
14285,speaking of Charlotesville.........
14286,That's a paddlin'
14287,Lucky for us this won't be the rate going forward.
14288,"No-one else can see it, the OP has been removed."
14289,Idiot.
14290,This is comforting.
14291,I definitely want to get vaccinated but I've been so anxious because last year I got a flu vaccine and it was awful.
14292,I usually respond well to vaccines but the flu shot kicked my ass.
14293,"That's true, but the USA has already vaccinated over 2 million people (probably way more - reporting lags by days) in the first two weeks, with the second vaccine (Moderna) only being available in the last week or so."
14294,This is also the beginning of a ramp-up period.
14295,I expect the vaccination rate to scale up very fast.
14296,"Also, due to the phased roll-out, there's overhead involved with coordinating appointments and distributing the vaccine to only selected people, which slows things down."
14297,"Once it hits the general population phase when you'll be able to drive up and get it at a pharmacy or distribution center, I expect them to be sticking people at a much higher rate, like a production line."
14298,And my final note is that this pandemic will effectively be over for most people well before herd immunity is actually reached.
14299,"Once all the old heads are vaccinated (they're in the early phase), the death rate will drop like a rock."
14300,"Sure, the virus will keep spreading, but once hospitalizations and deaths drop, the pressure goes way down."
14301,The 'New Strain' excuse is only levied towards the states that the subreddit likes.
14302,I didn't realize they were trialing it conjunction with the Pfizer one.
14303,Thanks.
14304,No they didn’t submit the paperwork.
14305,Date I'm curious about is when the number of new vaccinations that day will exceed the number of new infections in the same period.
14306,&gt;they are completely different vaccine types (mRNA vs viral).
14307,False: Oxford is a Chimp based viral vector.
14308,Sputnik &amp; J&amp;J are both Adeno viral vector vaccines.
14309,Operation 1/100th impulse speed.
14310,I wonder where in WV you are?
14311,"A friend of mine lives right on the border between VA and WV and he says that virtually nobody wears a mask, most public activity is basically the same as it has always been."
14312,It also assumes everyone is willing to take it.
14313,Maybe they know they don't have the data to support their cause?
14314,I remember a lot of questions being raised about their data when they first announced their clinical trial results.
14315,Where's that one poster who used to always swing by to tell us how great Florida's numbers were?
14316,I hope I’m wrong.

14318,"It's hard to tell from the article, but would recirculated air pass through the anti-virus filter?"

14321,"Something tells me if they were a few points bluer, you'd wouldn't be making that joke."
14322,"Not could have, it did happen."
14323,It was well documented at the time and is easily verifiable.
14324,It was also used as another gotcha moment by Western media that didn't understand.
14325,The deaths stopped because the case load was so low.
14326,It's not a very deadly disease all things considered.
14327,I think telling on your neighbors if they have a bomb is a good idea don't you?
14328,It's the same thing here.
14329,If people are spreading the virus around willy nilly they should be put in jail...
14330,They shouldn't have these parties that they are having and they shouldn't have death traps made.
14331,It will end up spreading to the neighbors themselves and could kill them.
14332,No thanks.
14333,I'd rather everyone be safe.
14334,The government needs to start fining people 10% of their monthly salary if they have parties or walk into a grocery store without a mask on... That'll get them to stop.

14380,I replied to stating that at least in the US that I didn't think a lot of people now days think themselves that important and are more or less just stuck where they are.
14381,However they also maybe good enough at their job that taking a day or so off could cause a localized set back.
14382,Does it make them feel bad or important?
14383,Possibly but who doesn't when anyone tells them that things went bad because they weren't there.
14384,Its both a ego boost and scorning method by a manager or coworkers to do that to anyone who calls in sick or takes vacation or any kind of other reason days off.
14385,This being from my experience so I am bias.

14389,They do not know yet.
14390,But if anything close to herd immunity is reached within a year then the spread of the virus will be very significantly reduced.
14391,"Kind of early for an announcement, I wasn't expecting them to admit anything until Friday or Saturday, if ever."
14392,My mom was a waitress.
14393,She despised people leaving all their penny change.
14394,"Not only was the amount an insult, then she had to carry it around all night and count and wrap it up before the bank would take it in a deposit."
14395,"""According to the published data \[by Pfizer about the vaccine trials\], six of the participants in the  experiment died, two of whom received the vaccine and four of the control group""

Four participants in the trials died without ever getting the vaccine."
14396,Chew on that anti-vaxers.
14397,lol
14398,Yep.
14399,I had all the symptoms except shortness of breath in late February.
14400,There was a confirmed case on my floor in my workplace about a week and a half earlier.
14401,"I called the doctor and they said that because I wasn’t basically dying they could not justify the effort required to get me a COVID-19 test, because I wouldn’t get one."
14402,But be sure to call them back if things get worse.
14403,"One of my friends from work who was also sick called the states Department of Health directly to ask for a test, same situation as me."
14404,The state told him because he wasn’t basically dying they could not give him a test.
14405,Neither of us will ever know if we had it at this point.
14406,"No shit, nobody had tests at the beginning of this crap."
14407,"Mild cases wouldn't have been registered, just as they weren't in the West."
14408,Big time.
14409,Climate change is so much of a bigger issue.
14410,"Personally, I have done a lot about that."
14411,Oooo though.
14412,Please don’t go around saying that the biggest problems with the measures is missed haircuts.
14413,I know a person who starved to death as a direct result of a nursing home quarantine.
14414,"Plus, if you read CIDRAP’s article, the majority of excess deaths right now in the 25-44 year old range are not Covid deaths, so it isn’t an isolated incident to have people literally dying as a consequence of the things we are doing to try to slow the spread of Covid-19."
14415,Just using logic...
14416,If the Oxford vaccine trials continue to be subpar there would be less demand for it.
14417,Redesigning and retesting will take too long to see any returns which were minimal anyway.
14418,The quick path to a viable product then is to license and manufacture a vaccine that uses similar technology.
14419,Both the Sputnik and J&amp;J vaccines are similar enough that their existing manufacturing capabilities could produce them quickly and efficiently.
14420,Those might not be the only options but the quicker you can get into the market the better
14421,"If you need 85% inoculation for herd immunity and 40% won't be vaccinated, you'll never get there!"
14422,"The number of infected people is in reality way more than 20 million, I've seen estimates that it's double or more."
14423,Certain parts of Queens in NY saw the number of people with antibodies in the 30% range after the first outbreak.
14424,To be fair it could be the side effects of lockdown.
14425,"People are isolated, broken from their routine, and had a hope of home stretch as the vaccines began to roll out."
14426,It’s starting to look more and more like we have a few months before we can start to lift restrictions.
14427,That is mentally taxing an pretty much anyone whether you consciously or unconsciously process it.
14428,honestly...
14429,I doubt the anti-maskers care what happens to the poor or minorities since they are bearing the brunt of the deaths..
14430,But first gear has the most torque!
14431,Government: What do the people want?
14432,Government Page: Um... *checks Reddit* ... Epic Gaming Compounds.
14433,Government: Give the people Epic Gaming Compounds!

14435,Lol an international database storing personal medical details of everyone on the planet.
14436,What a great idea.
14437,Who would be the keeper of such a database and why would any country agree to it?
14438,Actually you should be concerned.
14439,At this rate if they don’t increase administrations of the vaccine it would take over 4 years to vaccinate most of the populatipn.
14440,Criminally?
14441,Where is the source on that please?
14442,thanks

14445,Oh shit.
14446,If you think science is an opinion then you’re definitely not one of the smartest people you know.
14447,Either way you’re probably not that smart because smart people don’t have to announce how smart they are 🤷‍♀️
14448,&gt; Maybe it's because they use emergency approval while the EU has conditional approval which is more stringent.
14449,This is the most likely answer.
14450,That;s a bit too much hyperbole but generally agreed.
14451,"As much as I hate the term ""both sides"", both sides of this debate tend to think in static terms."
14452,On a smaller scale that's what happened in my state.
14453,The main population center got hit in March so everyone shut down.
14454,Even the remote rural areas without any sort of presence of the virus.
14455,That meant there were a lot of people fed up and rejecting restrictions by the time the virus actually started cycling thru the community in September.
14456,There is a holdback of the other 20m doses to be shipped out in three weeks.
14457,Same with Moderna but at four weeks.
14458,They didn't blow it.
14459,"They have a vaccine with high levels of efficacy and safety, along with the biggest production capacity out of any vaccine and the easiest vaccine to transport."
14460,There is no doubt in my mind that the AZ vaccine will have the biggest global impact
14461,"It needs to be higher than that, if not we're going to be in lockdown for at least another year."
14462,No shit

14471,Might be an issue of people just not knowing it's available.
14472,My 80 year old grandma gets most of her medical news from the newspaper and her doctors office/pharmacy.
14473,If they were doing vaccines for the elderly and they advertised it on Facebook or something she'd have no idea it was even able.
14474,[removed]
14475,That's a cardigan you uncultured swine.
14476,A lot of immunocompromised people cannot get vaccines.
14477,"These are people with cancer, HIV, MS, etc."
14478,Anyone with a chronic disease.
14479,Some people even have to take medication to specifically suppress their immune system.
14480,"Now, I'm not saying that everyone with these chronic diseases won't be able to get it."
14481,It's more for people with a high severity of their preexisting disease.
14482,Lol a week ago I was arguing with someone about this on here and got fieldhouse m downvoted a ton.
14483,I think I put a reminder to show him a week or two down so time to show him I was right.
14484,Funny you should throw yet another whataboutism in the discussion.
14485,Plenty of doctors fly their own planes to moonlight shifts.
14486,It's probably more common with physicians than any other kind of professional.
14487,Children will probably be included in a few months.
14488,The trials will be completed in a few months.
14489,And it’s very important for them to get vaccinated.
14490,"Not because of their chance of complications, but because they are spreaders."
14491,"If you want herd immunity, you want a high percentage of the herd to have immunity."
14492,Kids are in the herd.
14493,Too bad they didn't release the doctors so they could report freely on what was happening.
14494,"You, a simpleton : Mandatory Masks

Me, an intellectual : Oral Protection Requirement"
14495,"Unless the allergies are literally instant death, people with severe allergies have already been getting the vaccine and just deal with the reaction as normal."
14496,The pregnant thing is a non-starter since the CDC has recommended they be near the front of the line for the vaccine.
14497,"The amount of people who absolutely cannot get the vaccine is effectively zero, excluding children obviously."
14498,it’s only a matter of time before we know exactly how to fix that.
14499,stay strong😊
14500,"All I see on nowadays is

""Smashing"" ""breaking"" ""surpassing"" records."
14501,"Well, in defense of this sentiment, the legislative priorities of Texas and California are quite different in regard to COVID, both at a state and national level."
14502,"The reality is, you can have a Democratic government that is trying,  but still enough conservative shitbirds to wreck pandemic control, or you can have a Republican government that is actively not trying, and even more conservatives that think masks are an affront to their freedom."
14503,This isn't particularly difficult to understand.
14504,"I feel back for your nation, having the leader it has and the mindset of a lot of people."
14505,Sorry.
14506,"Yeah, it's probably more than 3"
14507,Im skeptical but I hope youre right
14508,I would have to say Rear Window
14509,They have the data otherwise the MHRA wouldn't be about to approve it in the next day or so.
14510,"But I guess it is easier for them to get it approved by 1 regulator first, and then send the necessary data to other regulators who can approve it quickly."
14511,[removed]
14512,"So then if it's so obvious it should be simple to get a side by side study done, but it's not, and the few we have are inconclusive."
14513,"And don't forget silencing the doctors, hiding the evidence, and blocking investigations into the origins of the virus."
14514,USA is doing pretty badly though..
14515,Huge states of people just don't believe the virus exists.
14516,Like at least in Europe most people do and at least the government has shut down most of the countries.
14517,Like the USA is still open.
14518,Until two weeks ago gyms and restaurants were open in my town.
14519,They closed them down for the break ..
14520,When everyone left.
14521,Like what?
14522,My sister lives in Canada and she said that gyms and restaurants have been closed since like the beginning when they were in green.. My town is also a college town and we were open the whole semester ... And we are opening next semester also in like February.
14523,It's fucking stupid.
14524,Because they are fucking idiots.
14525,Their testing protocols were ripped in a Wired article and they cherry picked results from multiple trials with different protocols then combined them.
14526,It's hard to imagine how this is overlooked.
14527,The only trial that produced 90% numbers was an accident and only included young participants.
14528,"If they show complete trials, even one, with acceptable numbers it could be approved but what's been shown so far is a complete mess."
14529,Definitely not the who.
14530,Even if the vaccine is 60% effective that's ok. We can re-vaccinate people in the fall if they get a suboptimal vaccine in the winter/spring.
14531,60% is much better than nothing
14532,Not to say operation warp speed isn’t a success.
14533,We’ve developed over 5 effective vaccinations in under 11 months.
14534,"The real problem was trusting already busy delivery companies to ship out the vaccinations, let alone get them there on time"
14535,[removed]
14536,It's a very deceptive disease.
14537,"I was in the process of moving out of the state when covid first hit, but iirc we started shutting things down before our first confirmed case."
14538,I’m sure that helped a ton.
14539,"&gt; rest of us who do already get it, don’t need to be told again."
14540,The rest of us do actually need to be told again and again.
14541,Because all of us have the potential to be idiotic and to let our guard down.
14542,"Education and outreach are never a ""one and done"" thing."
14543,You've got to keep doing it because people--even smart people--tend to forget stuff if isn't always in their awareness.
14544,We really have no idea.
14545,My symptoms after the Pfizer one was on par with what others have reported.
14546,"Outside of that, no idea if I've gotten stronger immunity after my first Pfizer dose (and 2nd vaccine dose)."
14547,I'm gonna keep acting as if I don't have any immunity at all.
14548,Haha!
14549,[removed]
14550,The MHRA have much more data - from the article it seems AZ haven't even submitted data to the EMA so I guess they are just referring to the interim analysis in the Lancet.
14551,"The shingles vaccine is notorious though, it is the example usually given for a vaccine that has likely side effects."
14552,"Rabies vaccine might be worse, but it's so uncommon most people aren't familiar with it."
14553,I had radiating pins and needles and my arms would twitch while sleeping for months.
14554,Kind of scared me off vaccines despite being relatively rational about them.
14555,"HPV vaccine was my favorite, I swear it cured my hand warts which my doctor just laughed off but there is some limited evidence for that kind of broad immune response."

14560,A tea company sponsored it.
14561,What?
14562,"Soriot said they think they have the right dosing and data that will get them efficacy similar to Moderna and Pfizer - if that's 80-90% it certainly won't make them look like losers, but actually a company that has a very very good vaccine."

14580,Look at California where all those wonderful good liberal folks voted to say fuck the drivers we just want cheap Ubers.
14581,I gotta give it to Democrats.
14582,They've successfully convinced nearly half the country that they give a shit about workers rights.
14583,Calling it a lie implies intent to deceive.
14584,With that critical detail in mind it’s clear that Fauci did not lie.
14585,"He presented what was deemed, at the time, to be appropriate guidance."
14586,Even the CDC was saying at the start that masks weren’t necessarily/didn’t help.
14587,They were wrong and they updated their guidelines to reflect it.
14588,That’s how the scientific method is supposed to work when people are doing research properly.
14589,Fauci isn’t the enemy.
14590,COVID-19 is the enemy.
14591,Let’s keep that in mind and move on.
14592,I have learned that we all live in a society.
14593,May have been?
14594,Ya think?
14595,The 2 million number has numerous times been shown to be flawed and is likely much higher than that.
14596,"However, even at 50% higher they will not hit the goal"
14597,That’s probably true.
14598,I have to wait for CVS to come to my work and give it to me early January.

14607,"I also read that because everyone needs two doses, they would not release the first dose until the 2nd dose is available."
14608,"Not sure exactly how that works, does each site only administer half of their doses, or do they wait for a 2nd shipment or what."
14609,"On one hand these logistics are challenging especially around the holidays and the added complication of the ""cold chain""."
14610,On the other hand they've had months to plan for it...
14611,They can’t even figure out the first round.
14612,Imagine the nightmare that will come with the second dose.
14613,Especially with multiple vaccines that can’t be taken together.
14614,I’m sure they’ll get it sorted out in no time /s
14615,In other news; hollywood just secured 500k vaccines to ensure the country's culture is protected.
14616,You still get quite a bit of protection after the first shot.
14617,They honestly should consider a one shot regimen for certain low risk people to get this done faster.
14618,Early to mid 2021 results are expected but could be earlier if cases continue to soar.
14619,"This is from OP:

&gt; all the staff selected in the first round of volunteers are going to be taking as many covid patients as they can handle with no days off until the rest of the staff get their turn."
14620,All I'm saying is they shouldn't have enacted this policy until after the second dose.
14621,"Those that received the vaccine aren't immune yet, but they are now being exposed much more than before."
14622,In reality it means someone being in vaccinated a LOT longer.
14623,"Even if they cover their mistake and vaccinate ppl at this location, it takes it from somewhere else"
14624,"Masks shouldn’t be treated as a permanent measure, they should be treated as a temporary safety measure."
14625,"During a pandemic masks are a necessary evil, they fog up glasses and are uncomfortable to wear but they are necessary to protect the wearer and others from aerosolized virus particles."
14626,"Once the pandemic is no longer an issue, masks should stop being required in public life."
14627,"If people want to wear masks during flu season they should be free to do so, but unless another pandemic comes along they shouldn’t be required after Covid is no longer an issue."

14638,That object is 949 of 538.
14639,The one who will receive it shall already be expecting it.
14640,You are shifting the goal posts again.
14641,At this point we have video in whatever spectrum you want to view it in showing how even cheap t-shirt masks provide some protection.
14642,And we know that viruses are transmitted in the water droplets that exit your mouth when you speak.

14652,"Yeah, COVID is nothing compared to what can happen."
14653,A different virus could be many times more infectious than COVID and more deadly or not deadly but has a high chance of leaving people with crippling side effects.
14654,"We are lucky it was only COVID and we got some practice as a planet, but we mostly failed and the denier crowd seems more empowered than ever."
14655,I expect pandemics to get more common with rising population and climate change so when the BIG ONE goes comes the denier mindsets are really going to get hit hard.
14656,"Like all those religious leaders just taught their followers to not take pandemics seriously, but this was a low lethality virus really and when they do that on a more serious virus it's going to really murder a lot of people."

14660,"Germans are so precise at everything,  how did this happen?"
14661,"Anecdotally, my 99yo grandmother lives in a nursing home."
14662,The helpers there told her “I’m not going to get the vaccine for a few months until everyone else does it first.
14663,I don’t trust it”.
14664,Now she is scared to get it.
14665,I told her that’s exactly WHY she needs it - if her caretakers refuse to get it she need to protect herself.
14666,"Here in TN, the call went out for first responders to get the vaccine, and on the day I went, the parking lot was full and cars were lined up down the street outside the health department."
14667,It was a drive-though clinic and they were remarkably efficient.
14668,"Even with all that traffic, I was in and out in under 45 minutes."
14669,Thing is i feel that covid should have a 10% death rate as that is roughly what the hospitalisation rate is/was.
14670,The fact that modern medicine is good enough that we can save 90% of people rather than simply provide them all with palative care is remarkable.
14671,Its why we need to keep cases down too as if hospitals run out if beds we'll see the death rate jump as the untreated die.
14672,Zero empathy and imagination

14697,I'll just point out that the EU did NOT sign such an order.
14698,The approval of the Pfizer vaccine in the EU was the worlds first regular vaccine approval for a Covid vaccine.
14699,"They did try to lobby the EU to sign such an order, but it was rightly concluded that it would erode confidence in the vaccine, and so it was refused."
14700,"I'm guilty of this and realize it's not a sanitary practice, but are we really at risk of having coronavirus particles on our necks but not be infected already?"
14701,The risk of actually getting infected this way seems almost nil.
14702,"It's the other germs and constant fidgeting with your mask (hands to face) that is more of an issue, I would think."
14703,best and brightest......
14704,"Cool, can I get that vaccine then?"
14705,He’s been the most accurate model for infections and deaths so I see no reason why he won’t be for vaccinations.
14706,"From your link:  
&gt;Scientists have criticised Oxford university and AstraZeneca over how they disclosed data relating to the trials of the vaccine, accusing them of omitting important details."
14707,I didn't make this up and I don't care how they succeed as long as it's legitimate.
14708,If the regulators are happy with 62% that's their perogative.
14709,"Don,t tell us it's 90% if it's only rarely 90% though."
14710,There are enough questions about the way results were presented so far to make people take notice.
14711,"No, men have a similar top but with trousers."
14712,I remember an article very early on where they interviewed people who lived near or worked with funeral homes in Wuhan.
14713,"They said the crematoriums were running 24/7 and unless every funeral home in Wuhan was buying a ten year supply of urns and coffins, tens of thousands of deaths were occurring that were never being reported."
14714,This was when they were claiming four hundred or so deaths for Wuhan.
14715,Ditto.
14716,"I didn’t even feel the last one (flu)

My last tetanus shot swelled my arm up pretty good though."
14717,"(Older / Medical worker MiL is getting moderna round one this week, will be interested in her experience.)"
14718,"If verifiable this will be a huge help everywhere, although I can already see a lot of people having problems following the 2-3 months apart bit."
14719,That’s a good point.
14720,I saw that “warp speed” wasn’t going anywhere near as fast as they predicted and I for some reason felt really down this morning.
14721,Weather isn’t helping
14722,If the vaccine was safe they wouldn't need shielding from lawsuits.
14723,"I can make my own antibodies for free, i would rather do that."
14724,The vaccines have not been reviewed well.
14725,The only data we have is directly from the companies themselves.
14726,There is not any peer review.
14727,So why wouldn't I be skeptical?
14728,Herd immunity will happen either way.
14729,The vaccines won't be rolled out fast enough and right now we don't have any proof that they actually protect other people from the virus.
14730,"If vaccinated folks are only protecting themselves, then it's going to continue to spread."
14731,What is really sad is people are so alarmist like you.
14732,"I take it seriously, I wear a mask, I stayed locked up for x-mas while my family carried on...."
14733,"I'm very much in this fight for the better, but I am very concerned about the vaccine program."
14734,A lot of people are making money hand over first with the MRNA technology and it's not really proven just yet.
14735,Then why so easily offended by things people say?
14736,I would imagine if deaths and ICU capacity drop significantly positivity rates won't matter that much anymore because (at least in my small brain understanding) it seems like the vaccines could basically just make everyone asymptomatic but still test positive (idk for sure though)
14737,I thought of getting an antibody test.
14738,"How we the antibodies wear off after a matter of months, and then they only get produced again by memory cells if you’re exposed again."

14740,"They don't call the v-tail Bonanza the ""doctor killer"" for nothing"
14741,"Maybe if every industry suffered equally, there would be a better response to everyone."
14742,"**Fact**: ICU occupancy as of December was 78%, according to a recent study cited by Vox."
14743,**My claim**: This is normal for winter.
14744,We typically have high ICU occupancy due to winter illnesses including seasonal flu.
14745,"This kind of ICU occupancy is nothing new to hospitals, the only difference is that a large proportion of illnesses now are COVID."
14746,**Your claim**: This is NOT normal!

14757,I just can't.
14758,I've really been trying.
14759,But I'm breaking inside.
14760,"I wish ""I like people and interacting with them"" wasn't such a controversial opinion nowadays."
14761,It breaks my heart.
14762,The data showed 62% efficiency.
14763,I wouldn't really say they botched it up.
14764,Yes a very small amount did receive half dose accidentally which gave 90% efficiency although this could simply be a fluke.
14765,But that error in giving a very small amount of people half a dose doesn't invalidate the 62% efficiency they got
14766,She’s been in the hospital since Easter?

14829,He's been changing his numbers for a while now to encourage vaccination (I think/hope) he also said in that interview it could be anywhere from 70-90% but is just setting expectations to be for the higher amount in case that's what it ends up being

14858,The latest restrictions are based on ICU capacity (fair) but the previous tiers were based on only cases + positivity rate and the lowest tier required under ONE case per 100k per day.
14859,"Which lets face it, is still probably impossible in any substantial county until early 2023 even WITH vaccines."

14883,Within 2 months of the start of 2021 we may see the death rate drop to flu levels since the elderly would have largely been vaccinated.

## Abstract

The ongoing pandemic caused by SARS-CoV-2 has spilled over into humans from an animal reservoir."
14885,"Notably, the virus is now spilling back into a variety of animal species."
14886,It appears striking that American (Neovison vison) and European (Mustela vison) minks are the first intensively farmed animal to experience outbreaks.
14887,"Neither of these have occurred in Asia or Africa but rather in Europe - namely Spain, Denmark, Netherlands and in the US, at a mink farm in Utah."
14888,"Current evidence indicates that the virus was transmitted to the animals through infected human workers on the farm.At the time of writing, SARS-CoV-2 infection has not been documented in any other intensively farmed species, suggesting that mustelids may exhibit a higher susceptibility to the virus."
14889,Studies have shown that domestic ferrets have an extremely low resistance to COVID-19 infection (Shi et al.
14890,2020).
14891,Mustelids comprise approximately 60 different species (Kollas et al.
14892,"2015) and are widely distributed across a number of habitats, both aquatic (marine and freshwater), and terrestrial (prairies, steppes, tundra, forests)."
14893,"Several wild mustelids have become acclimated to urban areas - such as raccoons, otters and badgers, and some are raised in households as pets - such as ferrets."
14894,"The latter are perhaps at greater risk of infection than their cousins inhabiting the wild, but it is the former that we should be most worried about."
14895,"If infection by SARS-CoV-2 spills into wild mustelids, these have the potential to become a permanent reservoir of infection for other animal species."
14896,Such a scenario has been seen before with rabies in raccoons and skunks (Rupprecht et al.
14897,1995) and with bovine tuberculosis in badgers (Gallagher and Clifton-Hadley 2000).We believe that it is important to prioritize studies in mustelids on their putative role as reservoirs and amplifiers of SARS-CoV-2 infection in animals and subsequently humans.
14898,The development of appropriate surveillance and intervention strategies will determine if mustelids are one of the key links in the chain to the initiation of an unprecedented epochal event: a panzootic.
14899,What makes Covid more deadly is not the fatality rate but the fact that it is not seasonal and has continued to spread throughout the year even in the warm weather months.
14900,"Imagine if flu season was 12 months a year, the fatality figures would be the same."
14901,This is the real difference statistically.
14902,Take an average month of flu season and multiply by 12 and you get the Covid numbers.
14903,There is an enormous difference between infections and cases which is still not understood but there is mounting evidence that it's a difference of 5-10x.
14904,They have done antibody testing in certain areas and found that infections are multiples of cases.
14905,"They eventually estimated that 20% of the world's population was exposed to H1N1 ""Swine Flu"" and I don't see any reason why this virus would be any different."
14906,The US has reported 20 million cases which is only 6% of the population.
14907,Would not surprise me at all if we later find out that 25-50% of the population has been exposed.
14908,The CDC has already released direction.
14909,All the states need to do is execute - compel hospitals to put in the hours to complete the work.
14910,[removed]
14911,Yeah I haven’t either.
14912,I’d much rather get a shot than have my blood drawn.
14913,Oh I see where I went wrong.
14914,"The original comment stated we needed 85% inoculation for herd immunity, but what I presumed they meant was that we need 85% immunity (via vaccination or natural infection) to reach herd immunity."
14915,"I still think they mean that, though."
14916,"Afaik we don’t have to actually vax 85% to achieve herd immunity, because so many have had a live covid infection already."
14917,&gt;Who says they have new data that would warrant approval?
14918,[The AstraZeneca chief executive](https://www.ft.com/content/61938eba-0ca3-436d-a043-89ac80d5c87a)
14919,I think it’s for liability and insurance issues perhaps?
14920,Being vaccinated = a lesser chance of hospitalization and death.
14921,Might also reduce fears of flying and stimulate travel again in the future.
14922,"There are many papers that are only a quick google search away:

https://academic.oup.com/qje/article-abstract/134/4/1793/5492274?redirectedFrom=fulltext

https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/fullarticle/1106078

14926,Completely misread your post.
14927,I'm not entirely sure.
14928,Immunocompromised is not a one size fits all kind of thing.
14929,I'm sure there are immunocompromised people that can take the vaccine because it will not effect them in a super negative way.
14930,"For instance, someone with diabetes type 1 is immunocompromised but might be able to take the vaccine rather than someone with breast cancer."
14931,I'm sure there are stipulations to all of this.
14932,I'm no professional though.
14933,Lol I love seeing these Florida vs. California cases takes that conservative news like Fox keeps making.
14934,"Just casually ignore California has almost twice the population of Florida and forget the concept of ""per population"" entirely"
14935,Most likely by late summer early fall.
14936,"If you think the WHO has been effectual, I suggest you look at millions of infected and 1.7 million dead."
14937,Do they have an obligation to tell you when you drop out whether you got a vaccine or a placebo?
14938,Or are you just left wondering?
14939,"Idk, I think he should just ""leave it up to god,"" and let the vaccine go to actual front-lobe workers."

14960,No?
14961,Then stop making false claims and spreading misinformation.

14968,Mystery solved
14969,That age group has a 15-20% mortality rate if they catch it.
14970,"Right, some more so, some less so."
14971,Mutations are all random.
14972,"The best ones survive and spread more, weaker ones don't."
14973,"So by definition the mutations which survive will be more virulent...stronger, better at spreading, more resistant etc."
14974,R0 and Rt are very different.
14975,try something like 2^10 versus 1.2^10 (40% less Rt).

14989,If x amount happen a day and there are x amount of waking hours in a day and a particularly elderly cohort is being vaccinated what is the expected incidence of heart failure?
14990,This is actually what they look at in the vaccine trials.
14991,It’s the amount of expected background health issues.
14992,A few weeks ago Osterholm had a great segment addressing it on his podcast.
14993,He told the story of a doctor who had a series of vaccine shots loaded on the tray when the child went into a seizure which was the start of a lifelong neurological ailment.
14994,They never got the vaccines but 5 minutes later they would have.
14995,Just an example of what to expect when you vaccinate millions.
14996,These stories will be common unfortunately.
14997,I always point to Vietnam when people say that nothing could have been done to contain this virus.
14998,Borders China and isn't an island.
14999,"Lack of discipline, lack of leadership, and too much individualism."
15000,As you say official deaths.
15001,There is no reason to trust the official Chinese data when just yesterday an independent reporter got sentenced to 4 years in prison.
15002,"66,811 cases, surging still, where is the end to all this?"
15003,This was in the UK.
15004,Please be sure to use the report button to report any misinformation - we take it very seriously.
15005,You are also welcome to modmail us or dm me if you have specific concerns.
15006,I feel so fucking bad right now.
15007,Last night I went to what I was under the impression was a small get together with some buddies since we're all home for christmas break from college.
15008,"When I got there there were only 5 people, including me."
15009,I had a couple drinks and then my parents called me saying that my dad's friend died of COVID and that my dad wasnt comfortable with me being out.
15010,"If I would have known before hand that he didnt want me to go out, I wouldn't have and I just feel bad that I wasn't able to go home right away since I refuse to drink and drive."
15011,To make matters worse more people showed up and that was not a situation I wanted to be in.
15012,So eventually I slipped away into one of the bedrooms and chilled by myself to try and be as responsible as I could by keeping my distance.
15013,I'm just worried cause it's the only time I've hung out with anyone besides my family and coworkers since this started and freaked my dad out.
15014,"I did everything I could, but I made my dad worried :("
15015,Why don't countries shut down for other germs then?
15016,The US is huge.
15017,The level of mask wearing really just depends on where you live in the US.
15018,DaE EurOPe?!?
15019,!
15020,We see the same rise in mobility that we saw before Thanksgiving time.
15021,"https://www.gstatic.com/covid19/mobility/2020-12-25_US_Mobility_Report_en.pdf

We also saw an increase in air travel which could lead to re-seeding of the virus in places that were on the decline."
15022,That takes longer than 2 weeks to hit and there's generally around a 1-1.5 month lag from the time mobility increases to the time we begin to see upward trajectory in cases.
15023,"I'm looking for an old interview, perhaps two or three months into the pandemic."
15024,It was of an epidemiologist or some researcher saying that Covid-19 was the scariest virus he has come across.
15025,I remember some people saying that he was exaggerating at the time.
15026,I can't recall his name.
15027,"If this rings a bell with anyone, please send me a link."
15028,"&amp;#x200B;

Thank you."
15029,"Taken alone, it can add to the cause of arterial calcification."
15030,It needs to be taken with Vitamin K to help prevent this.
15031,Traditional rural lifestyles have been obsolete for some time.
15032,"As population grows and resource management improves, the need to spend on our smallest centers declines."
15033,The remainder population is usually made of traditionalist holdouts who don't care that their way of living isn't sustainable.
15034,I’m saying it was true that the CDC was not recommending mask wearing at the time that Fauci claimed they were not recommending mask wearing.
15035,"When it was found out that asymptomatic transmission was occurring, the CDC changed their recommendations, Fauci did too."
15036,Quoting the dictionary does not settle a thousands-year-old debate on the true definition of lying.
15037,It’s far more philosophical.
15038,"Here’s a prominent philosophy publication’s description:

&gt; There is no universally accepted definition of lying to others."
15039,The dictionary definition of lying is “to make a false statement with the intention to deceive” (OED 1989) but there are numerous problems with this definition.
15040,https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/lying-definition/
15041,Only the best people!
15042,/s
15043,Excellent point
15044,Its exactly the same.
15045,Aids weakens people to being unable to fight off illnesses that they otherwise would.
15046,It doesn't directly kill the victim.
15047,You're saying that if covid does the same it shouldn't count as a covid death.
15048,That's semantics.
15049,And you're a heartless dick for making the argument.
15050,I am saying that the hospital ship and its staff.
15051,"You're reposting, so I'm reposting

You'd think that at any point in time the professionals working in the media could have checked the monthly RosStat death numbers, which are handily sorted by region and bypass the self-reporting of the regional governments."
15052,"Nearly a year into this, it's apparently news now."
15053,This is a case of different agencies using different inputs for their death numbers.
15054,"One uses national death registry numbers, and the other is self-reported by the regions."
15055,"Both are still used and ""valid,"" depending on whom you ask."
15056,"RosStat is considered the more definitive and objective one, and it's this number that this article is referring to."
15057,&gt;To  give a  background.
15058,"There are two  separate government bodies - RosStat   (statistics), and RosPotrebNadzor  (consumer rights)."
15059,The first is   responsible for general statistics and  the second for C-19 handling.
15060,"&gt;  
&gt;RosStat    when it comes to raw numbers is quite precise."
15061,"They might ""cheat"" in    some compound stats (like inflation), but how they do it is mostly    public as they publish their methodologies."
15062,"To count deaths, RosStat    collects its data directly from ZAGS (offices responsible for    registering all newborns and deaths)."
15063,"&gt;  
&gt;RosPotrebNadzor    numbers are collected in a different way."
15064,They aggregate data which  is   reported by each \*region's government\*.
15065,"As local governors have a  say  in  it, some of them underreport or simply fake it."
15066,"There is a nice   article  with good visualization - [check this one for example](https://zona.media/article/2020/11/23/120k) (in Russian), unsurprisingly the most notorious are Chechnya, Dagestan, and ""friends""."
15067,"&gt;  
&gt;So,  back to the article."
15068,"It says ""Russia admits...""."
15069,"No, it doesn't."
15070,"The    only difference now is that one of the ministers, when asked directly,    said that RosStat isn't wrong and that both numbers are correct, and  the   difference comes from the fact that RosStat and RosPotrebNadzor  have   different methodologies."
15071,No changes in the way how  RosPotrebNadzor   numbers are counted is announced.
15072,"&gt;  
&gt;As for RosStat numbers, they're available with a slight delay at the end of each month."
15073,This is why elderly should get vaccinated before essential workers.
15074,So it's been a little over 24 hours since I got the first dose of the Moderna vaccine.
15075,"I had some body ache yesterday, but over night things really took a turn for the worse."
15076,"Severe chills, fever, sweats headache, body ache."
15077,The works.
15078,I had Covid back in March and was told that my side effects/reaction to the vaccine may be worse because of this.
15079,"I'm feeling better now, but that's probably because of the tylenol and advil."
15080,It feels just like when I had Covid and that wasn't fun
15081,Co-morbidity doesn’t mean you die.
15082,It can mean you have a more severe case and need to be hospitalized.
15083,Edit: most but not all of the younger people that have been seriously ill or died have one of the comorbidities.
15084,Slow is an understatement.
15085,"As of right now, NY has done 67,000 vaccinations."
15086,"We have over 350,000 stocked up."
15087,It’s ridiculous.
15088,Still quite angry about that yeah.
15089,I wouldn't be flying nowhere no how anywhere right now
15090,"Seriously, you need a new Reddit ID because you're obviously stealing her title."
15091,"Stolen valor isn't cool, man."
15092,;-)
15093,"He definitely lied, and admitted doing so in a later interview."
15094,I don't understand the need for a daddy figure that makes people see Fauci as one who can do no wrong.
15095,"Seems like people desperately want to hold up someone as the ""adult in the room"" since the handling of covid has been so poor."
15096,"Yes, the administration has been incompetent, but Fauci is part of the administration and shares the blame."
15097,The guy is 80 years old and and served in multiple administrations.
15098,It isn't like he is the only knowledgeable expert we've got.
15099,"If he really wanted to make a point about how incompetent the Trump administration was, and wanted to be the ""adult in the room,"" he could have publicly resigned and used his resignation to call attention to the poor handling."
15100,"You can debate whether it was a necessary lie in order to retain masks for healthcare workers (I think it wasn't), but it definitely hasn't helped to have the same guy who said not to wear them turning around and telling people to do so later."
15101,"If he had a shred of honor, he would have publicly resigned after lying about masks, and said ""I felt that it was necessary at the time, but my previous statements have hurt public trust in health authorities and I feel that I must resign to restore that trust."""
15102,"Had he done something like that, then maybe he'd be deserving of respect."
15103,"Again, he's 80 years old and loaded."
15104,He doesn't need to hold onto his position.
15105,"At the very least, people could stop pathetically trying to make him into a hero."
15106,He's a hack and is part of the problem.
15107,UK will conduct human challenge trials next month.
15108,They should expend this to the UK variant and Vaccine!
15109,We need to know sooner and start working on a combo vaccine!
15110,In some ways this is better.
15111,"In the hospital we struggle with electronic charts, slow computers, badge passes to move anywhere."
15112,In the tents we have paper charting and the tasks of medicine go faster so we can actually care for the patients.
15113,[deleted]
15114,"My apologies, I honestly thought it was true, I read that on a couple of threads and no one challenged it so I thought it was true"
15115,"Medspa doctors and nurses can't just jump into an ICU lol, nor even a hospital at all really."
15116,"They don't have time to train people, only nurses with applicable experience."
15117,Wow.
15118,Kinda lost for words.
15119,It’s *mostly* old people that die.
15120,19 year olds die from the flu too.
15121,"Is horrible, it sucks, but it happens."
15122,"In 2019, there were almost 200 pediatric flu deaths in the US."
15123,you mean secondary effects
15124,"Ooh that’s science right there

What paper was that that  said “if you try once and succeed, but then the virus ever comes back it means your country should give up because science”"
15125,"&gt; In the U.S., last year 175 million people were vaccinated."
15126,"If we assume that the vaccinations took place over 5 months (which I think is an eminently reasonable assumption), that is 35 million flu shots per month."
15127,"Right, but this took place against the backdrop of normal daily life rather than amidst a global pandemic, unprecedented social/political strife and disruptions to every level of industry, government and healthcare."
15128,"It also involved vaccines that were comparatively easy to transport and store, which were not precious commodities being coveted by everyone on earth, and which generated ""opposition"" only on the most extreme fringe of discourse rather than alarmingly close to the mainstream."
15129,"Anti-vaxxers existed, certainly, but nobody who mattered cared if you got the 2019 flu shot, and the people who decided to get it likely did so without giving the experience a second thought."
15130,"Now we have to see this thing through in a cultural ferment that involves half the U.S. seeing their chosen political and media figures regularly implying that the vaccine (like the pandemic itself, allegedly) is part of some plot against them, while even those unswayed by such claims are still having fears about the vaccine's safety stoked by a multitude of sources."
15131,"It's just not the same situation at all, and I really don't think the flu vaccine campaign should be taken as an exemplar of how this will or even could unfold."
15132,Hope so too.
15133,Calling it individualism is too respectful IMO.
15134,It's selfishness.
15135,Individuals have the right to not be killed by the negligence of another.
15136,"True, cases are very steady here in the US lately"
15137,In 1918 they were just discovering viruses existed.
15138,"If coronavirus hit in 1918 it would be as bad or worse in terms of mortality as the Spanish, especially with the same wartime/post-war population it circulated."
15139,A large percentage of Americans have no health insurance and would have to pay out of pocket for everything.
15140,Even those with insurance would still have to pay if fees are not covered by their insurance or over a certain amount or not approved by their insurance provider .
15141,It’s quite inhumane by international standards.
15142,Testing is offered to public for free but after that you are on your own.
15143,It’s spelled “escape goat”
15144,You can be offended all you want.
15145,Just let them say it.
15146,Yes.
15147,The point is to make that insurance mandatory.
15148,A know rural ambulances often do several hour transfers to a big hospital.
15149,"Rural hospitals have a great er for the seconds count stuff, and can do common stuff, but the not seconds count rare stuff where they want a bigger hospital to take over happens several times a month."
15150,no sympathy at all.
15151,"You act like pandemic fatigue isn't part of the reason people are disregarding restrictions, lmao."
15152,"Humans are social animals, that socialize in a wide variety of ways."
15153,"And I'm getting real sick of people like you who want to act all smug about ""pEoPlE aRe DyInG""."
15154,"Shut up, let us vent."
15155,Hospitals start blasting Let the Bodies Hit the Floor over the intercom.
15156,Definitely.
15157,Fingers crossed things will be better in the Spring
15158,China's own CDC is the source being cited by this article out of Taiwan.
15159,"You would think people would rather **not** learn from the school of hard knocks, yet here we are..."
15160,"I’d say late March but I’m not expert, only time will tell now."
15161,"Hard to believe this is happening, just a week ago, there were reporting 25,000 cases a day"
15162,"Surprisingly we havent started seeing a spike yet from christmas, what if we just dont see a spike..."
15163,"""I actually meant to ask, how does your mom like her tenderloin?"
15164,"\*Tosses lube on conveyor belt.\* Oh, I forgot box wine and condoms, I'll have to go back."""
15165,r/sino is leaking in the comments section.
15166,Can the mods contain this please?
15167,Thanks.
15168,"Dude people can debate the ethics of this pandemic all day but at the end of the day, a lot of people would rather take the risk."
15169,And that number is just going to grow as the months go on.
15170,What did people honestly expect?
15171,That we would sit inside and zoom each other for a year and a half?
15172,Cyber communication can only take us so far.
15173,It’s not a substitute for real life.
15174,We let it happen with the fireworks.
15175,That was the last thing we had.
15176,Wish this was the case everywhere
15177,Yeah I don’t know why people are trying to spin this.
15178,It was a dumb thing to do.
15179,By trying to manipulate the public to achieve something instead of just being transparent about it is never going to turn out good.
15180,All it does is cause distrust.
15181,Late February?
15182,Early March?
15183,"Over Christmas they were still hitting over 40,000 cases a day which was their highest so far too, either way cases are way up."
15184,It's a start.
15185,Probably worth waiting a few days and seeing if this is just an outlier.
15186,"Its a Tuesday and some devolved areas haven't reported as normal over Christmas, so figures are only just been added to the tally"
15187,the curves just kept coming though so we had to do it multiple times.
15188,Seems like the virus moves the posts.
15189,Especially going into winter (in the US).
15190,Remember like twenty years ago when fox news was a laughingstock because of how overtly partisan they were about the 2000 election?
15191,"And then slowly but surely, other news platforms decided to say ""nah, let's actually do that too"""
15192,"yup, the freedums."
15193,At this rate it will be a while.
15194,&gt; Corona bros are never going to stop shaming people for living their lives because they get Internet points and a sense of belonging for it.
15195,"I've been so tired of the ""ha ha look at the anti-masker"" / ""I'm so smart for wearing a mask"" karma-farmers that won't stop flooding r/all."
15196,except it is still expected that you can spread it.
15197,Being fully vaccinated doesn't mean you can stop wearing a mask right now.
15198,Surprised to see support for the one-China-policy on reddit!
15199,"I have relatives in Moscow and I live in a neighboring country, from what I hear shits really bad and totally neglected in some places."
15200,I'm astonished they released any number of deaths because papa Putin will smother any wider reports of a crisis.
15201,This really hits home for me.
15202,I’m a new nurse this year and moved for my first nursing job at a rural hospital in March.
15203,I wasn’t really familiar w small town life and politics but it really has been a big deal.
15204,They complain they can’t get any new blood here but refuse to rent to anyone who’s name they don’t recognize and socially shut out anyone new.
15205,I get asked over and over “what’d you move to ____ for?” Huh?
15206,"I dunno, why everyone else who moved does so."
15207,They are currently pushing who was the favorite family doctor out over his repeated requests to wear a mask in public.
15208,I value lots of things about the people and lifestyle out here but god forbid I say anything about the big city I’m from or call out the other nurses at the station talking about us needing to do “COVID parties” ala chickenpox.
15209,a whole lot.
15210,most ppl aren't taking this seriously at all.
15211,i fear for an even deadlier pandemic than this.

Makes sense /s"
15215,Yeah I was actually gonna say it feels like months ago?!
15216,This year is wack for time relative things
15217,Many people i talk with at work have said they won't get the vaccine and it pisses me off because they in my opinion are no better than the people who don't wear masks and don't wash hands and are one of the major reasons the virus has spread...
15218,This is terrible.
15219,Everything about it
15220,Yup.
15221,Everybody acts surprised that this is what we are doing but this was the plan since March.
15222,We play whack-a-mole until a vaccine.
15223,That’s literally what we’ve been doing this whole time and everybody is surprised pikachu
15224,"That's the equivalent of 257,104 cases in the US, the Christmas shopping connection and new virus strain is really hitting the UK hard"
15225,That article title was ass btw.
15226,They’re still on pace to hit their new goal which is 20 million by end of January first week.
15227,75 million of us are under 18 and not eligible.
15228,"Even if we just get everyone over 50 by April, that will put a SERIOUS dent in deaths and hospitalizations."
15229,"It was one person, it was Disneyworld not Disneyland, and her employment had absolutely nothing to do with her vaccination."
15230,"It was supposedly a hospital trying to use extra doses before they expired, and she knew someone at the hospital who got her access."
15231,China didn’t have the resources to count every single case of Covid in the early outbreak.
15232,This is not surprising to any epidemiologist and is to be expected.
15233,Thanks.
15234,I would never say anything negative about it.
15235,"I'm so grateful 1/4 of our parents are vaccinated, because I love them all dearly."
15236,"Just thinking about the future, and the perhaps long wait for my father to get it, turns my stomach sometimes.."
15237,I'm so afraid for him.
15238,"But he's avoided it thus far and is fairly careful, so."
15239,Little victories.
15240,That is atrocious.
15241,New variant is no joke I guess.
15242,I wonder how long this will take to die down to their summer levels of triple digit cases?
15243,More transmissible variant that can still grow exponentially in most levels of control.
15244,"I don't really disagree but just a few points:             
- WW II didn't kill 80 millions people              
- Sweden has 8500 deaths *as of today* not 7000."
15245,- Because being the worst is not only about the death rate per capita *as of today* it's about everything on the whole year.
15246,Sweden is the worst because they had the worst strategy with a predictable but disastrous outcome.
15247,"Andorra has more deaths per capita, but having 75 deaths near Spain is quite acceptable."
15248,"Even for a pop of 77,000 persons."
15249,"Sweden may not have the higher death rate per capita, *as of today* - but they used to; it doesn't change the fact that they messed up the management of the pandemic big time."
15250,"The testing, the masks, the information, the measures... Everything."
15251,"I think it’s hilarious how often this argument is used, especially by Trump."
15252,“See look!
15253,They’re doing bad too!
15254,"Look at the UK, they’re having a surge too!"
15255,"Nobody is talking about that!”

It’s so incredibly childish."
15256,If anything the focus should be on places doing WELL so their mandates and response can be emulated.
15257,&gt; Yea and no one was ever killed by aids either.
15258,WTF?
15259,&gt; Fuck your semantics.
15260,"It's not fucking semantics, it's an important and relevant distinction."
15261,"Oh boy, they didn't think it was a joke and were taking it seriously at first."
15262,"Yep, welcome to 2020."
15263,&gt; If the death rate from this was something like the Spanish flu or small pox people would have paid more attention to it...
15264,"I'd like to think that but there were anti-maskers in America in 1918, too."
15265,A common response to something this scary is just denial.
15266,I bartend in LA and when we were open over the summer and fall I was serving nothing but tourists downtown.
15267,"It was maddening because they'd complain or ask me why isn't there anything to do and it took all of me not to scream back ""theres nothing to do because of YOU"""
15268,No worries.
15269,🙂
15270,It’s bad here.
15271,"A city with 12 million people and 0 ICU beds, people are going to die indirectly due to COVID."
15272,Don’t worry.
15273,"They’re necessary for now but as soon as everyone who wants the vaccine has had a decent opportunity to get it, mask requirements are gone."
15274,As it should be.
15275,Living in North America we take all these freedoms for granted and it allows us to become entitled d-bags who think the government shouldn't be able to tell us to do anything even if it's unquestionably in our best interests.
15276,The end result: the shitshow that is the USA right now which all could have been avoided if people just wore a damn mask instead of acting like spoiled children.
15277,"You're right about some of this, but there's a lot of people who gathered on Halloween and were fine, then again on Thanksgiving and were fine."
15278,Then they got it on Christmas.
15279,As the cases have risen each gathering becomes more likely to spread it.
15280,"Also, the new cases look like they are dropping, but how much of that is delays in reporting due to the holidays?"
15281,We saw a similar effect around Thanksgiving.
15282,The spike came the following weekend.
15283,In this case though we may see further delay because of new years.
15284,You know that 2nd world means Soviet/China allies and not middle income right.
15285,Also China have vaccine too and supply it to poor countries.
15286,But the more vaccine companies the faster it will get done.
15287,Sweden compared to Hungary you say?
15288,Now imagine that it had to come to that.
15289,I kind of agree.
15290,I feel like wearing one to a bar or something would kinda be pointless anyway due to taking it off to drink.

15299,"I’m no fan of Trump, but unfortunately the Biden/DNC camp represents exactly what the CCP wants, and they have people in every aspect of power, from media to corporate."
15300,It may not be long before our society operates like this.
15301,"Have you noticed that it’s considered taboo even in the US to talk about the origins of the virus, even though there are no real answers there?"
15302,Yeah.
15303,I like how you ignored the part of my comment where I said 'and people still whined and violated it'.
15304,"Also, just as an fyi, now here we are at Christmas and in spite of having had that outlet over the summer, a lot of people still dgaf and gathered over Christmas."
15305,Because the truth is that a lot of people are incredibly selfish and self-centered.
15306,We're going to have to agree to disagree.
15307,"You can blame those preaching caution all you want, but at least those people are working to prevent deaths while the rest of you whine."
15308,"You need to go and do some reading and see how many families had 'harmless' little gatherings and then ended up with Grandma dead, or Aunt Sally dead, etc."
15309,"This is 2020, when people are more connected and have more means of communication than they have had at any point in human history and still people act like whiny babies."

15311,Baby.
15312,Foreign doctors in the 70 - 80s had to work in rural areas.
15313,"in the UK the priority list is mainly oldest first, starting with 85+"
15314,I just look at the other government run healthcare systems in the US and they generally have good systems to protect providers from lawsuits.
15315,Examples are community health and the VA. I’m hoping any form of universal healthcare have similar protections.
15316,The hundreds of thousands of people who made up the clinical trials: Am I a joke to you?

15334,That's assuming you have staff to handle this.
15335,Some of the areas are also facing labor issues too from the nursing staff because a percentage of them are dying/getting sick/quitting.
15336,"If we go to circus tents to handle triage, you are also going to have to make the decision to allow ""non-qualified"" people to make decisions."
15337,And I say it that way for no better way of wording it.
15338,"We had a shortage of doctors already in California, so certain things will have to bumped down to Nurses being able to make decision and the laws to allow this, even if just temporary."

15346,The entire population vaccinated by then?
15347,"Unlikely, but the death rate will have dropped to nearly nothing by that point since we're vaccinating the high risk populations first."
15348,Because the location is trash.
15349,So we get out.

15360,Allergies are really bad where I live and sometimes I (and others) get stomach aches from all the drainage.
15361,It's weird because a lot of the time I won't even be sneezing or coughing but I will get a stomach ache.

15408,I waited in college and one time had a couple out on a date.
15409,They paid in cash and had only $0.02 in change.
15410,They had been pretty rude so I figured that would be my tip but gave them the 2 pennies back in case I was wrong.
15411,"I came back to the table and they were gone and the two pennies were still there so I thought ""well shit, the assholes tipped me two cents"" but then the girl in my section said she saw them go to the bathroom."
15412,They hadn't actually left yet.
15413,So I put the two cents back and left them alone again.
15414,Once they had actually left I went back to the table to find they didn't leave me two cents as a tip.
15415,They had actually taken one of them.
15416,They only left me one cent lol.
15417,"Sure, California is such a trumpian state"
15418,We don’t know whether the vaccine protects from transmission or not.
15419,But there’s a good chance that it reduces the likelihood of transmission at least a little.
15420,"Once the vaccine is free and widely available, it would be reasonable for businesses and public spaces to refuse entry to unvaccinated people on this basis."
15421,We already do it with schools.

15429,And here's to hoping for more good to come out of the bad in the coming year.
15430,Friend lost his father today.

15433,"Yeah, I don't usually come to the daily posts and I'm a bit surprised at the conspiracy theories and anti-doing-anything-other-than-normal that's being pushed in the comments."
15434,"Well, I obviously can’t be 100% sure what Fauci’s motivations are."
15435,All I can do is make educated guesses based on analyses of his public statements.
15436,"But yes, it seems likely to me that he wants our society to shift in a permanent way, where we never really go back to 2019 and are forever more physically separate from each other."
15437,"This is what many epidemiologists have openly advocated for, in the name of preventing as much future illness as possible."
15438,And of course I understand that Fauci wants more people to be vaccinated.
15439,"Although if anything, it might make people less likely to take it if they think that herd immunity is too difficult to achieve."
15440,"I will get a vaccine in either case, but I could see others being more willing if they believe that it will really make a difference in helping us achieve herd immunity."
15441,"&gt;“Which is worse, the person gets the virus and survives and they still have a business, or they don’t get the virus and they lose their livelihood?” he said."
15442,This need not be the either or.
15443,"We should have had that if one has no income, one's bills get dismissed, That goes up the chain: people, small businesses, can't pay their rent or whatever, the property owner gets their bills dismissed."

15446,i'd give money to the local stripper but they closed down all the sex worker establishments.
15447,And how many did follow it?
15448,How many had better mental health and willingness to comply with future restrictions because they were given that outlet all summer?
15449,You’re not a hero for preaching “caution” when that caution drove millions of people into depression and suicidal thoughts solely because you were unwilling to acknowledge the realities of human nature.
15450,Do you know what harm reduction is?
15451,I’ve always wondered.
15452,Thanks.
15453,Well yeah crime is up almost everywhere in the US
15454,"Yeah, good plan."
15455,"Let's focus on attacking her instead, because obviously CCP can do no wrong on this sub."
15456,Lol
15457,A lot of schools are having students back on campus but most classes online.
15458,"And it’s other things too, like schools will use “financial hardships” as an excuse to not fund activities."
15459,Difference is the teachers aren’t making policy decisions
15460,"&gt; Obviously early on facing an unknown illness, they were probably unsure of best treatment practices, and I’m sure as hospitals were overwhelmed trying to figure out how to deal with it

What you say here can also be said for NY, which has also been trying to find ""probable"" covid deaths since so many people weren't properly tested and died without tests."
15461,"NYC only recorded 400k cases, but well more than 2 million have been infected based on seroprevalence."
15462,So I'd say the numbers compare well to NYC.
15463,"There would have been more unreported deaths, but not to the point of being orders of magnitude more."
15464,Our PACUs are currently full of our “non-COVID” admits.
15465,Trying to keep the COVID patients in private rooms.
15466,Personally I think they should be cohorting them in the PACUs and trying to keep the people who don’t have COVID in private rooms we are admitting upwards of 20 patients a day.
15467,Our morgue is full.
15468,They quietly parked a refrigerator truck out back.
15469,I’m an ER nurse in LA.
15470,Had to put a dead body in our pediatric waiting room last night because there was nowhere else for him to go.
15471,The crazy thing is how truly shocked people were when they came in and saw the chaos.
15472,The best part may have been telling one of our wealthy donor type patients that is used to moving to the front of the line she had to wait like everyone else.
15473,I’m sure she would have liked to call our patient relations rep but she’s unfortunately admitted with COVID and the other one quit.
15474,Her daughter had pulled her from another facility because she “didn’t like the care” and thought we would “get her in right away” because her doctor called ahead!
15475,This woman’s pulse ox was 80% by the way.
15476,We slapped some oxygen on her and I told her it would probably be at least two hours before she goes back.
15477,If we run out of oxygen like they predict people like that will die.
15478,Lots of people will die and we won’t be able to do anything for them.

15485,It does!
15486,"As an American my president said, on national TV, "" ""You know why we have so many \[coronavirus\] case numbers?"
15487,"Because we do more testing than any country in the world ... there's plenty good about testing, too."
15488,"The bad thing is you find cases."""

15490,You misunderstood it.
15491,Try again.
15492,Several years ago I interviewed for a local software dev job in rural MN.
15493,The questions about my tech qualifications were secondary to what they were really interested in me for: 40yo father of two with family in-town.
15494,They asked me a LOT about that.
15495,Turns out any companies in rural America with IT have a major problem with recent college grads working for a year or two before they're gone to the big city 2 hours away.
15496,Compared to that a guy like me with serious roots?
15497,As long as I had a pulse I was hired.
15498,I’ve already decided the only restriction I’m following is masks and physical distancing in public places with strangers.

15503,So how was your asymptomatic polio &amp; measles?
15504,Did you spread it to everyone around you?
15505,"Oh wait no, that’s not how vaccinations work 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂"
15506,This is what happens when you have a governor that plays favorites and doesn’t lead by example.
15507,Thank you for this.
15508,It’s very pleasant seeing an objective comment based in actual facts instead of intense sinophobic reaction.
15509,Roll Tide!!
15510,!
15511,Here in BC we had the bubble idea and people still whined and violated it.
15512,The truth is that a lot of people just want to run around and act normal and not care about others in the slightest.
15513,"So no, I am not going to blame those who have been preaching caution and care over those who have just not given a shit."
15514,Those who don't give a shit wouldn't have given a shit regardless.
15515,"China is both omniscient and incompetent, duh"
15516,"Good, it does make sense in a way (fewer issues with vector immunity)."
15517,Many states are getting fewer vaccines.
15518,Maine had to delay vaccinations due to fewer doses received than promised.

15520,"Yeah, it sucks when the world's so ableist that it can't even acknowledge the disabilities that have come from a breath-spread pandemic virus."
15521,"It would definitely stop the spread, though."
15522,They do need to start working on there PR.
15523,If they were the ones to explain things then we would get a better response from the Public.
15524,"If they had came out and explained to people that there’s still a good chance this virus can evolve and become more deadly the more people are affect, I bet people will gladly stay home hoping not to be the one to get the deadly strain."
15525,They would hesitate knowing there’s  a possibility that could be the one that develops the deadly versions that spread.
15526,"Same, but the restaurants in my area can allow dine in now"
15527,"&gt; This is madness, these are all solvable problems

I agree with you 100% but apparently they're not solvable here in the US for the morons who are running the country."
15528,As it should be.
15529,I'm pretty sure there isn't any reason not to wear one.

15531,"If you have someone with an extra 100 lbs, going on half rations for a few months would do them quite a bit of good."
15532,The US is one of the most obese large countries in the world which is why there are lots of coronavirus deaths.

15544,It's everyone against Covid-19.
15545,You were!
15546,As somebody at high risk for COVID complications because of health issues it's been indescribably bad for my mental health to realize just how little people value protecting vulnerable members of their communities vs. not needing to inconvenience themselves
15547,I was told by Reddit that this is a uniquely American problem.
15548,Shocking.
15549,"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Certificate_of_Vaccination_or_Prophylaxis

Exactly."
15550,I had to carry one when our family was traveling to certain countries in the '70s.
15551,Huh?
15552,Our poor people are fat so nobody in the country has a problem with hunger?
15553,That doesn't even make a little sense.

15560,This week a Brazilian “””influencer””” had just been released from the ICU and went to the airport to catch a flight.
15561,Witnesses said he kept removing his mask to record Instagram stories and was coughing a lot.
15562,The airport staff had to isolate the part of the airport he was on and he couldn’t enter the airplane.
15563,also there is evidence to suggest the virus can spread through the plumbing in multi-unit housing like apartments especially if the p-trap dries out.
15564,So what?
15565,"If you don't want to get a vaccine that could prevent you from spreading a deadly virus, why shouldn't businesses have the right to refuse you service?"
15566,Why should your kids be allowed to endanger other students at school?
15567,"If people are so insistent on not getting the vaccine, fine, but that doesn't mean we should welcome them in public \*or\* private spaces."
15568,Shocking.
15569,I'm shocked.
15570,"Well, not that shocked."
15571,Lol.
15572,Yup
15573,I count them in because I think by April when it’s generally available it will likely be available to them anyway
15574,Exactly.
15575,About as stupid as having a designated pee zone in a public swimming pool.
15576,You cant even report a late train to Amtrak...they are a shit show and an embarrassment to what could be possible if someone actually cared about US rail systems
15577,I don't really have a recipe but what I do is super simple.
15578,I rinse the liver and  cook it at the same time I cook a package of bacon to the temperature that is rare for pork.
15579,"I remove both liver and bacon  from the souse vide and I cook the bacon in a skillet until it just starts to crisp, I don't flip it but you could."
15580,Then I add the liver but I don't really cook it any more -- just get it all bacony.
15581,"Remove the meat, add a couple of tablespoons of heavy cream to the fat in the pan and heat very briefly to make ""gravy""."
15582,Pour that on the meat.
15583,And now you will like liver.
15584,I've tried this in the souse vide for 2 hours and for 12 hours and I thought it was surprisingly similar.
15585,I thought the 12 hours would make it like pate but it didn't .
15586,"Maybe a longer cook time would make it softer, or maybe liver doesn't obey the usual rules."
15587,I'm not sure but so far it's been good at both 2 and 12 hours.
15588,I haven't even bothered to soak the liver in milk like they say to do because I never have milk on hand.
15589,I did rinse it really well in water though.
15590,"I might try not even doing that because  I think I can cook the liver right in the plastic I get it in, frozen, from the farmer."
15591,I buy bacon sealed in plastic with no cardboard or anything inside and I just put that whole thing in the souse vide.
15592,I'm not sure if you are supposed to do that but it's easy so I do.
15593,"Its*

If it’s such a toxic place, maybe people should stop trying to immigrate here en masse."
15594,Super bizarre that so many people want to come here if we’re such a shit country.
15595,"Maybe if we make ourselves even shittier, people will stop risking their lives to get here."

15616,"By all accounts the number who are not caught is higher than the number who are, so AT LEAST 4,000 attempt to cross the border each day."
15617,With the current infection rates in Mexico and Guatemala that’s at least a couple hundred COVID-19 cases walking across the border every single day.
15618,What’s the point of locking down with that going on?

Kodak Moves Into Pharma Backed by $765M Federal Loan

At the direction of [President Donald J. Trump](https://www.whitehouse.gov/people/donald-j-trump/), U.S. International [Development Finance Corporation (DFC)](https://www.dfc.gov/media/press-releases/dfc-sign-letter-interest-investment-kodaks-expansion-pharmaceuticals?CID=exit&amp;idhbx=dfcrelease) chief executive officer Adam Boehler has signed a letter of interest (LOI) to provide a $765 million loan to Eastman Kodak Company to support the launch of [Kodak Pharmaceuticals](https://www.kodak.com/en/company/page/kodak-pharmaceuticals), a new arm of the company that will produce critical pharmaceutical components."
15665,***The project would mark the first use of new authority delegated by President Trump’s recent executive order that enables DFC and the U.S. Department of Defense (DOD) to collaborate in support of the domestic response to COVID-19 under the Defense Production Act (DPA).
15666,***
15667,"&gt;“The idea there is to make sure the personal protective equipment, the test capacity and the raw materials for the vaccines are produced in adequate supply.”

&gt;The wartime production law, which allows the president to compel companies to prioritize manufacturing for national security, could help the U.S. secure components and specialized products that manufacturers need to produce the Covid vaccines."
15668,"Biden’s team has been weighing whether to invoke the law for vaccine production, NBC News reported last week."
15669,"&gt;**The New York Times reported last week that Pfizer, which manufactures one of the two Covid vaccines approved for emergency use in the U.S., began asking the Trump administration in September to help the pharmaceutical giant obtain some supplies needed for production but was disappointed by a lack of response."

15671,ventilators aren't vaccines.
15672,also trump turned down a contract to get less expensive vents designed on taxpayer $$$ to buy more expensive models by same manufacturer.
15673,Also let contract to maintain vents in national stockpile lapse so when they were shipped out many didn't work.
15674,4 million is worldwide
15675,&gt; MD isn't even that far from WV.
15676,"Yes, it's right next door."
15677,"From their post history, they seem to be in the Baltimore region."
15678,It's about 69 miles from Baltimore to the West Virginia border.
15679,"You're likely to stop for gas once along the way, which means you have points of contact at that gas station."
15680,"You're likely to you use the restroom, Also note that the quickest route from Baltimore to West Virginia is through the rural parts of the state, which are known for both a) having more cases per capita, and b) not wearing masks."
15681,"So you have that likelihood of spreading each time you go to a restroom, gas station, or any place you get food."
15682,I'm not spreading anti-science anti-vax fears.
15683,"I'm saying ""we shouldn't encourage masses of people to travel interstate to get the vaccine""."
15684,"Masses of out-of-staters would flood the local area, taking the vaccine from the local people who should probably get it, because they *live there*."
15685,Then the people have to come back for the second dose.
15686,People should wait and get the vaccine where they live.
15687,Pffft.
15688,I work with a guy who was sure that he had it in December.
15689,He's sure he got it from his doctor.

15695,"I can't find the source now, but there's been some literature posted that incidences of high fevers associated with viruses like this actually lower cancer rates."

15697,Not enough data for him to feel comfortable taking it.
15698,"But he has a pretty long history of being vaccine hesitant,  so I don't know if any data will be enough for him."
15699,"We ARE handling it, that's the only reason there's not a million people dead."
15700,It doesn't mean that it's not taking a mental toll on us.
15701,Am salary.
15702,Worked almost 3000 this year.
15703,"I am not eligible for overtime, as my salary is above that threshold (lucky me?)"
15704,"I essentially took a 30% paycut (Salty based on a 40 hour work week, therefore every hour over, and every vacation day not taken, is a pay cut) because I get paid the same for 40 hours a week, or 60 hours a week."
15705,bit too far chief
15706,Do I get anything if I made over 100K by myself?
15707,The narcissist label is pretty apt.
15708,"On a related note, here, most grocery stores are still waiving the fee for picking up your grocery order out behind the store..... but hoards of people are still going inside -- the parking lots are packed."
15709,Why?
15710,"A main thing I hear is that ""I can't stand having other people pick out my groceries."""
15711,"The store being discussed this time has a feature where you can ""leave a note"" for each item if you want -- I use that to leave instructions on things I'm pickier about, and so far the shoppers have followed the instructions really well, they do a very good job."
15712,"The thing that annoys me most, perhaps, in this particular facet of the larger discussion, is that many of these super-picky people are the same ones who freak the fuck out if they see someone unmasked or not properly masked, in some cases even saying that person should be arrested for attempted murder (no, really) or endangerment or assault or something..... um, if you're THAT worried, get your groceries by pick-up, like I do."
15713,You have to expect you're going to run into a certain percentage of people who aren't making correctly or at all for one reason or another.
15714,"Which is another reason I don't go in anywhere, still -- I have a very very difficult time breathing masked."
15715,"I acknowledge part of that is psychological, but not all of it."
15716,So I just don't put myself in that situation as much as possible.

15907,&gt;WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A senior U.S. public health official on Tuesday said the coronavirus testing the United States now is requiring for travelers from Britain should probably be extended to other countries as well.
15908,"“I think that probably should be extended to other countries,” U.S. Assistant Secretary for Health Brett Giroir told MSNBC."
15909,The “mRNA instructions” don’t degrade with the time - they degrade almost instantly after synthesising the protein.
15910,"What stays is the antibodies (for a, so far, unknown amount of time) and (in theory) the population of memory cells that carry the instructions to generate antibodies against the virus (these cells start to reproduce once they come in contact with it and they become what’s called “plasmatic cells”, which then release the antibodies)."
15911,There’s also the matter of T immunity but I’m not aware if it’s been studied for the vaccines.
15912,"A “more permanent alteration of the cell genome” would be some sort of gene therapy, this is a completely different thing from a vaccine and one that so far isn’t really used in a clinical setting..."

15955,"So much stigma about therapy, but this kind of thing is a common reason to go."

15961,No need to say the diplomatic relationship needs to be repaired.
15962,But yes China lost less relatively.
15963,They haven’t applied because these agencies have signaled they’re not happy with the data from AZ’s UK trial.
15964,They don’t want the embarrassment of getting an outright rejection or even a close vote by some panels.
15965,That could seriously undermine general trust in vaccine safety and hurt their reputation as a company.
15966,"400,000 deaths in 10 months is the death rate for Covid."
15967,A lot of people who get the vaccine will have also previously had COVID.
15968,There will be overlap.
15969,It isn't going to be straight 100 mill + 100 mill = 200 mill.

16139,"California, since May or so, has been pretty average."

16144,"For reference, if the current trends hold in each state, it will take \~50 days for California to overtake Florida in total deaths/capita."

16262,"&gt;WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Colorado has discovered a case of a highly infectious coronavirus variant first detected in the United Kingdom, Colorado Governor Jared Polis said on Tuesday, the first known case in the United States."

16264,To hell and back
16265,[deleted]
16266,I think that has much more to do with seasonality and people’s frustration with how long the pandemic is going on than this new variant.
16267,The variant would have had to comprise a significant percentage of overall cases since October to be driving this recent wave and in that case it would have been detected sooner.
16268,I love my Surface Pro :'( will I want an iPad after vaccination??
16269,?
16270,Exactly.
16271,I haven’t seen anything showing this variant is less severe than the current virus.
16272,Edit: that’s why I posted the quote so people could see what was written in the article.
16273,But the numbers aren’t inaccurate or misleading since we are not talking about one specific individual’s risk.
16274,'cause even people who want to be vaccinated won't be for *many many* months to come.
16275,The risk is that people *think* that once they have a vaccine they don't need to wear a mask or socially distant anymore.
16276,"Sure, once everyone who wants to be vaccinated has been, then fuck the antivaxxers."
16277,"However, a nonsterilizing vaccine also means an increased chance for an escape mutation, so that's not great."
16278,Let people with medical badges skip the age line.
16279,"Sure, it might not work out perfect, but the current approach made one massive mistake."
16280,The current approach said ‘let’s do specific groups’.
16281,The problem is that there aren’t enough pharmacist at those specific groups to give out the vaccine.
16282,They created an artificial bottleneck by basically shutting out  80% of our pharmacists.
16283,Now hospitals are asking (or atleast my local one is) off duty pharmacists to come in just to give the vaccines.
16284,The plan was great but overlooked specific parts of reality.

16500,"If everything about covid-19 were identical - particularly the asymptomatic / presymptomatic spread and the potential to aerosolize given certain conditions - but the death rate among young people were 50x higher, would we have done anything about it?"
16501,I don't think so.
16502,CDC estimates IFR in young adults at 0.0002 (0.02%).
16503,Tell a 24 year old that they have a 99.98% chance of survival and they stop caring about the rules.
16504,"People cannot estimate very large or very small numbers accurately, so even if the virus had a young adult IFR of 0.01, they still wouldn't care that much."
16505,They would see 99% survival and fight back against public health measures that aren't endorsed by their chosen political leader.
16506,The IFR for people 50-69 is estimated at 0.005 (25x deadlier) and there are plenty of people in that age bracket that don't care.

16595,My cousin just said he doesn't trust the vaccine because Pfizer and Moderna have legal immunity.
16596,"Might I ask, is there any logical reason why they asked for legal immunity?"
16597,Is it because some people will die by coincidence after taking the vaccine because of the sheer number of vaccinated people and they would get sued for no reason?

16608,It’s irrelevant whether they would have listened or not.
16609,N95 mask supplies were bought up and it took an effort by N95 mask companies to stop orders going to non-medical use.
16610,"The same exact result could have been garnered by being honest, telling people to wear homemade masks and to save N95s for medical professionals by limiting the sale to medical facilities."

16750,"&gt;The ICU capacity measure “is standardized to reflect effective capacity in ICUs by looking at the percentage of COVID-19 positive patients in the ICU,” the department wrote."
16751,&gt;So that would mean each region has an ICU capacity that is “adjusted” to account for the intense demand for COVID-19 care.
16752,&gt;CDPH says it calculates the adjusted ICU capacity based on the proportion of ICU patients who have COVID-19.
16753,"“If a region is utilizing more than 30% of its ICU beds for COVID-19 positive patients, then its available ICU capacity is adjusted downward by 0.5% for each 1% over the 30% threshold,” according to the CDPH office of public affairs."

16765,What did he say about herd immunity that was a lie?
16766,That sucks.
16767,I always have a similar reaction to the flu shot.
16768,Not looking forward to the side effects even tho I'm excited to get the vaccine.
16769,"I find that ibuprofen, Gatorade, and a hot shower helps."
16770,If you have a heating pad/blanket those help too.
16771,The factories are not being expanded exponentially.
16772,"Sorry, I'm being pedantic and mathematical, but we are not gearing up for an exponential increase in vaccine supply."
16773,It would be limited by things like the number of suitable refrigerators to store and transport.
16774,"Exponential functions are utterly brutal in their growth, and it won't happen here, because there are very many constraints that will limit the growth in vaccination distribution."
16775,"The target of 2m per week is a challenge,  but its 2m this week, 2m next week, etc, so linear, not exponential."

16782,I was more concerned at how fast it was completed.
16783,I'm still reading up on an article someone provided in regards to the research of the vaccine.
16784,So hopefully I'll be more educated on this matter.
16785,Thanks.
16786,The source that said this was happening in Chinese to target Chinese people?
16787,What’s happened in California is mind boggling.
16788,The state with the most restrictions and effort taken to slow the spread has this explosion of cases.
16789,It’s almost as if we have our own genetic mutation that originated there that makes the virus more infectious.
16790,"The ""new"" variant was discovered in September."
16791,Borders did not close in time.
16792,"It's popping up all over the world, including here in Canada."

16800,How many grandmas have you killed?
16801,It's really disastrous that we cannot unite as one against this for the sake of us all.
16802,We have gone back into a pseudo lockdown and I am glad for it.
16803,Even if business is badly affected something has to be done right now.
16804,I have lost a number of people close to me due to this virus and I am still in shock - literally from hospitalisation to death within a week on average.
16805,The crematoriums are essentially running 24hrs a day and hospitals are running over capacity.
16806,It's pretty scary.
16807,Do the best to keep you and yours safe during these times.

16834,The UK was one of the few nations to report real-ish numbers during the Christmas weekend.

16839,Did I suggest removing the 2nd amendment at any point?
16840,I talked about gun control.
16841,I’m just equating the two.
16842,Sandy Hook specifically matters because of the age of the students.
16843,No one wants to think about a bunch of 5 and 6 year olds getting murdered.
16844,School shootings are few enough and far between that it’s not something the country feels the need to actually address.
16845,"If you think, however, that the response to covid would have been more proactive if kids were disproportionately affected, you need only to look at the response to Sandy Hook to realize that’s wishful thinking."
16846,You can single out little kids all you want and it won’t make a difference.
16847,"I’m not commenting on whether or not the country *needs* stronger gun control laws, just making a guess on what the response would be like based on a previous event targeting the same age range."
16848,"They had a 3 week lockdown, then opened up again."
16849,Three weeks arbitrarily set to make sure people could enjoy the holidays.
16850,With this level of infection they need to stop the whole people in your bubble shit.
16851,"Whatever,  and they are still planning to send the kids back to school."

16855,I don’t think he lied to us.
16856,"I think he was put in a really bad position by his boss, President trump, who never supported him, and he was forced to have an opinion on masks that Americans didn’t even care about at the time."
16857,But now they do.
16858,This is such a crock of shit projected by selfish Americans trying to find blame from anyone other than themselves.
16859,I'm not trying to diminish the shit year this has been.

16890,Citizens having the right to able to return to their country isnt an a matter of opinion but a rule of law.
16891,You can have an opinion about the timing or the logistics and the fact that the NZ quaratine system was already under a lot of stress prior to the new varient but the statement remains true.
16892,Kiwi citizens left in the UK need to realize that they are changing their mind in the middle of the busiest time and may not have wishes accomodated.
16893,CDC and FDA has made their recommendation (frontline hospital workers and nursing home residents) but states make their only decision.
16894,Majority of vaccines are administered to those two groups
16895,We don't even know if the vaccine even works yet and people are acting like we're all saved already.
16896,"So do you charge people for their thoughts, words or incentives?"
16897,"You can't control people's thoughts, and word is just a way to express thinking."

16998,Yeah but some person on reddit said a thing.

17000,The reason that this country is the state it's in is because people are dying.
17001,It completely makes sense to prioritize the groups that are the most susceptible to death.
17002,Ideally it should be nursing home residents as they're the subset of the elderly that are the most at risk.

17272,"For a county of 10 million people that really isn’t anything extraordinary

italy is 60 millions."
17273,that would equal to 864 deaths/day.
17274,Italy went full complete lockdown weeks before reaching those numbers and peaking around those numbers.
17275,In LA is life as usual.

17278,That was a time where the reported number of cases was about 5M.
17279,I wouldn’t be surprised if the actual antibody rate of Americans are actually closer to 1/3 of the population at the present.
17280,"Given how prevalent asymptomatic cases are and the various social factors that dissuades people from taking tests, it’s always a matter of to what degree case counts are being underreported by, and it’s not really fair to put the blame on any government agencies or accuse them of cover-up."

17299,They're considered important... and it's a positive signal to the public.
17300,"Some, at least, are  publicly taking the vaccine to show that they trust it."
17301,Developing that trust is really important after all the lies and half-truths that people have been sharing here.
17302,There was a minor uproar here when the CEO of Pfizer said he wasn't going to take it right away so that those in need could get it / he wouldn't jump the queue.
17303,People immediately started asking him what he was hiding.
17304,They are now doing four different dosage regime trials.
17305,"Damn, and here I am trying all my life to be getting up into a fur farm"
17306,"I agree that is foolish, but that's not really what's being discussed here, because those people were likely not sick on the way there (I'm presuming they were sheltered in place before traveling, though that may be giving them too much credit!)."
17307,"I think more likely that most of the people chose to travel, got sick while away, and then chose to get on a return flight with the sniffles, hoping that they just have a cold."
17308,Again I am in agreement that even then they shouldn't get on that plane.
17309,"But I think at that point they are not considering how much they want to visit grandma, they are traveling to get back to work so they can pay their rent."
17310,And not everyone has the freedom to call in sick.
17311,"If they can definitively prove that it does indeed work like they say it does, and it gets verified by an independent review board, then no one will care about any of that and there shouldn’t be any reason to not approve a vaccine that is significantly easier to make and that the government bought 300 million doses of."
17312,"It wouldn’t be my preferred first or second choice if we’ll even get the option to choose, but acting like this wouldn’t largely improve things and be a massive step towards normalcy is ridiculous."
17313,Excellent point 👍
17314,Not quite.
17315,I don't think most European countries are eager to share their citizens private data to others without reason - which it will be unless these individual are traveling for example.
17316,I actually think it might be against EU data protection regulation which overrules national laws so Spain might be committing a crime here.
17317,"Sure, but the same risk exists in hospital wards for Covid patients or in Covid testing stations."
17318,I hope Biden enacts the defense production act and seriously ramps up production..
17319,That last paragraph is on point.
17320,"It's great that Pfizer and Moderna are very effective, but the fact is that not everyone will have access to them, especially in the 1st half of next year."
17321,"Thus, the immediate focus should be on getting out as many vaccines as possible, afterwards once we've put the fire out, we can begin to hone in on the best of the best."
17322,There's been over 10 million vaccines sent out and it's *reported* that only 2 million vaccinations have been performed.
17323,"Of course that's way undercounting it, but unless they're undercounting by a *multiple of five*, what you're saying has nothing to do with anything."
17324,&gt;One such investigation of a 10-hour journey from London to Hanoi starting on March 1 found that 15 people were likely infected with COVID-19 in-flight—and that 12 of them had sat within a couple of rows of a single symptomatic passenger in business class.
17325,"Yeah, that shit isn't happening in a car or hotel room."
17326,"You're not going to get infected by someone sitting 20 rows ahead of you, obviously, but if anyone within 3 seats of you is infected, and you're on a long flight, you're getting it."
17327,You’re not wrong that I’m paranoid.
17328,I think I have reason to be.
17329,"We have almost reached the 20th anniversary of 9/11, and we never returned to the pre-9/11 “normal.” There are still draconian security restrictions at airports and elsewhere, and the government still has much broader surveillance powers than it did before 2001."
17330,These things remain the case even though it’s been almost two decades since the last significant foreign terrorist attack on U.S. soil.
17331,"So what happens long-term after a situation like Covid-19, where this country suffered the equivalent of 9/11 every single day for months on end?"
17332,When the total death toll in this country will likely end up around 200 times that of 9/11?
17333,"What I’m afraid of is the possibility that the public health messaging will shift - it’ll no longer be about flattening the curve, saving lives while we wait for the vaccine."
17334,"Instead, our mandate will be to remain under social distancing restrictions and wearing masks because “we can’t let our guard down” - because the virus could mutate, or the immunity conferred by the vaccine could wear off, and you never know, there could be another virus coming, we could always have some outbreak of horrifying airborne MERS or something, just like there could always be some Al Qaeda splinter group plotting our destruction... better safe than sorry!"
17335,I’m not saying that I expect restrictions to become *more* severe.
17336,"I’m saying that I expect influential public health officials to keep advocating for mask mandates and social distancing requirements indefinitely, and given how people like Fauci are practically worshipped by half the population, I expect that many people will abide by their recommendations."
17337,"Notice exactly what Professor Tseng said in that NYT article: “New preventative measures that we’ve had to adopt, like masks, will feel normal in time.” She’s clearly indicating here that masks are just one element of a set of permanent changes she expects us to make as a society."

17360,Not roughly 4 months.
17361,These have not been properly tested.
17362,Thanks for taking the bullet.
17363,Hope you have no side effects and that the vaccine is a success.
17364,"Honestly, not trying to be a dick here."
17365,I would be a little weary of the first batch.

17367,Choices.
17368,She's not the actual first patient.
17369,Stop saying that.

17395,I’m so sorry.
17396,My grandma passed last month at 90 from Parkinson’s and I think some of the same isolation issues in the hospital.
17397,She was able to come home and see her kids and husband because of hospice; but we are lucky to live in Washington where the virus isn’t crazy so that they could visit the long term care facility she lived in with my grandpa.
17398,Dying alone in a hospital is not something I’d want to wish on anyone.
17399,I’m so sorry.
17400,I stand by my diagnosis.
17401,I am curious what you mean by distribution?
17402,You mean giving the actual injections?
17403,"Because I heard Perna in an OWS briefing say that they have distributed vaccines to over 10,000 unique locations within the US."
17404,That is on average 200 locations per state.
17405,Gotta love how this is literally the most controversial (according to reddit's sorting) comment in the entire thread.
17406,"What you said isn't even outlandish, or weird, it's 100% possible and accurate."
17407,Horrible side effects have happened before with plenty of vaccines and we've had little to no time to test this one.
17408,The way they're rushing into this is incredibly weird and seems really unsafe.
17409,What long term effects could this have on people that could have healed from covid just fine naturally?
17410,Enough of the straw man arguments.
17411,I'm not arguing whether masks are effective or not.
17412,"What I'm saying is that for the most part where I live, people and businesses are complying..."
17413,YET cases are still increasing.
17414,The main reason people should continue to wear masks after being vaccinated isn't because they could spread the vaccine(?)
17415,"to other people, but because no one knows who's had it and who hasn't."
17416,Yes.
17417,Yes I am.
17418,Careful.
17419,You're only allowed to criticize Republicans in this sub.
17420,"AOC jumps the line, good public service."
17421,"Rubio jumps the line, bad."
17422,We should absolutely roll out this vaccine to every over 65 who wants it.
17423,They make up something like 80-85% of all deaths.
17424,Vaccinate all of them and deaths will start dropping very quickly
17425,not enacted until a week after the second dose!
17426,they’re just getting ready for that rn
17427,The government in FL is almost certainly messing with the data (I'm not sure that they have any actual data scientists handling this data since they fired and illegally raided the home of the last real one they had) and they're pretending like everything is normal for peak tourism season.
17428,"My understanding from friends (since I'm high-risk and don't go out at all) is that the ""rules and regulations"" are just a gentle suggestion everywhere except medical settings and nobody is following or enforcing them, so bars/restaurants/beaches/etc."

17432,"I feel like, only after that second stick, can you say “I got the vaccine.”"
17433,That can just mean you caught a flu that wasn't part of the vaccination that year.

17453,It is sad.
17454,It's also extremely enraging that people aren't taking it seriously.
17455,"It's great that black and brown people have gotten more visibility this year, but it's terrible that for some people, it required a pandemic that so far killed 300,000+ people and multiple instances of anti-black violence by cops and right-wing terrorists to understand a problem even exists."

17463,"""If""."
17464,They are talking about hypotheticals.
17465,They're not saying covid kills 2 in 100 children.
17466,"They're saying if it kills, world would react much differently."
17467,Two words:  Governor Bateman.

17472,"Yeah good luck getting educated Americans like healthcare workers to sign on to a system that assigns them a place to live/work, likely in rural Arkansas or a backwater town."
17473,"Telling doctors who are already reluctant to move to rural areas that they are going to be ""stationed"" somewhere sounds like a great way to exacerbate the physician shortage in America."
17474,"In general, you can fix any problem by creating an authoritarian decree that people *must* work to solve the problem, but that's not a world anyone wants to live in."
17475,"Before proposing things like this, think to yourself, ""how would I feel if someone took over my entire profession and mandated that I leave my home/life and move to rural Indiana?"""
17476,The way forward is always proper incentive and recruitment.
17477,Incentivize doctors/nurses to choose to work in rural areas.
17478,Make a big effort to recruit people into medical school/residency who want to live in rural areas from the get-go.
17479,"Nobody knows for sure yet, because nobody HAD covid for longer than a year, but it looks good that the immunity for most people could be lasting (i.e."
17480,many years).
17481,But we have to wait and see.
17482,That attitude is not unique to southerners or Americans.
17483,The whole world is over it.
17484,"Speaking as someone who has published several scientific articles, these too are often not ""up for proper critiquing""."
17485,I literally already posted it.
17486,"He admitted to saying that we need a higher innoculation % than necessary for herd imnunity, only to convince Americans to get vaccinated."
17487,The point is people like you deify people like Fauci to the point that they're above any criticism.
17488,Politifact used mental gymnastics in order to absolve him of lying.
17489,"“When polls said only about half of all Americans would take a vaccine, I was saying herd immunity would take 70 to 75 percent,” Fauci told the Times."
17490,"“Then, when newer surveys said 60 percent or more would take it, I thought, ‘I can nudge this up a bit,’ so I went to 80, 85.”

[Fauci: Herd immunity could require 90 percent of country to be vaccinated | TheHill](https://thehill.com/policy/healthcare/531611-fauci-herd-immunity-could-require-90-percent-of-country-to-be-vaccinated)"
17491,Don't keep a blacklist of people.
17492,"Make people give proof of vaccination instead, like a doctor's note."
17493,"Blacklists are scary and can be used for lots of harm, including to innocent people."
17494,"As I previously wrote, I'm not anti-vax and I think that's BS."
17495,But I'm not taking the vaccine because I want to see the side effects first.
17496,"Contrary to what Reddit likes to think, injecting stuff into your body can result in side effects, and I want to make sure side effects are minimal before injecting them."
17497,"While I will not travel to countries without COVID, since I don't want to risk reintroducing it-this blacklist is 1984."
17498,South America is doomed
17499,Also South African.
17500,So many people not wearing masks before.
17501,"Neighbour came over to yell at my mom for giving a man begging at the the door water to take away, not wearing a mask at all."
17502,Relieved at this too.
17503,Sweden is doing better than the same size country where mask wearing and curfews are reminiscent of a dictatorship (or pre ww ii germany).
17504,"But you are right, matter of perspective."
17505,Almost like MHRA is biased towards this vaccine because it is a thoroughbred UK vaccine and has a year long pattern of giving this vaccine passes when it doesn’t deserve it.
17506,"They allowed AZ to wing it after they discovered they gave the wrong dosage to huge number of people, they rushed through a safety review after an abnormal number of transverse myelitis cases developed in the trial completing their review in 6 days while it took FDA 6 weeks to come to the same conclusion."
17507,MHRAs endorsement rings a little hollow while most western agencies disagree with their conclusions.
17508,That's why France's infant mortality is so high.
17509,Found the guy that doesn’t lift
17510,That is definitely an apt comparison: covid has already killed more Americans than WW2 combat did.
17511,A weekly urgent care visit with free Covid test for the duration of multiple allergy seasons is still $120 or so a visit.
17512,Add in a not free flu test and that's more than most people could afford.
17513,Not to mention the excessive time off work to get tested.
17514,"With no weekly payments from government, people can't afford to protect others if they aren't working from home."
17515,It's understandable with everything we have been through this year.
17516,Always preparing for the worst.
17517,Except you'll never prove they're having a different outcome because no one can verify the data.
17518,People were walking around as normal in the US for months as if there was no pandemic as well.
17519,The illusion of normalcy is easy.
17520,It's the truth behind the appearances - including  behind what the government tells you -  that is something completely different.

17624,Oh yeah it sucked.
17625,I had pretty strong flu like symptoms.

17627,"It only lasted for a day each time or so, but it definitely sucked."
17628,"Bill Gates finally perfected the microchip, that is why the new AirPods Max look so stupid"
17629,We were told 20 million.
17630,People thought it would be 0.
17631,Now it's 5 and there's complaining.
17632,Hopefully Moderna and BioNTech begin experimenting with mRNA vaccines against bird flu as soon as this pandemic is over.
17633,"They were able to make the Sars-Cov-2 vaccine in two days, with the hold up being approval."
17634,"If we could have a vaccine ready for a hypothetical bird flu, with only a few changes necessary for whatever it actually is, a lot of those deaths could likely be mitigated."
17635,mRNA has the potential to change epidemiology regarding viruses as much as penicillin changed the way we think about bacterial infections.
17636,"It's a big, big deal."
17637,"ah I see, that make sense.."
17638,"[This Oct 23 paper](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-1132-9) predicts 96,000 fewer deaths from then to next February under 85% mask use and 130,000 fewer deaths under 95% mask use."
17639,"[This Nov 20 updated CDC briefing ](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/more/masking-science-sars-cov2.html) says ""increasing universal masking by 15% could prevent the need for lockdowns and reduce associated losses of up to $1 trillion or about 5% of gross domestic product."""
17640,I call these effects big differences.
17641,There have already been repeated pleas from the science communities that even vaccinated people should continue to wear masks.
17642,Not heeding these advice risks wasting the effects from vaccines scientists so tirelessly worked for.
17643,No I think what they’re saying is that this disease follows what we perceive to be a natural order.
17644,Older people and people with weakened immune systems typically are the most vulnerable to disease.
17645,“Healthy” people and young people typically have immune systems that fight off illness and enable them to survive.
17646,"Lives are not expendable and I am not saying anything of the sort, your human brain however can understand that older people dying from a new disease makes logical sense as they are most vulnerable."
17647,"Now when you hear of a virus killing children, or younger people or healthy people that is much more alarming to your brain as it doesn’t follow a natural order of life the way you expect."
17648,"To children’s immune systems ALL illnesses are “novel”, so what makes them susceptible to this new illness?"
17649,"Again no one is saying they are expendable, no human life is."
17650,It’s just how we perceive and categories risk factors related to illness and how we make sense of the world around us.
17651,"Yes, that'd be my ex wife's soul"
17652,I’ve yet to find a source that explains how exponential growth happens on top of exponential growth with regard to holiday bumps in cases.
17653,"It’s my, stupid and uninformed as it is, opinion that cases tend to rise and fall mostly independent of holidays and are more closely aligned with larger super spreader events that we don’t see."
17654,"That is, a holiday gathering of families may lead to a dozen or more cases down the line, but it pales in comparison to an underground party in a warehouse where over 100 transmissions occur."
17655,I honestly think the full picture is really obscured by the individual nature of reporting on cases.
17656,"All of this to say, things are already bad and getting worse in the next month, but I don’t think the “double rainbow” exponential growth on top of exponential growth will happen because on an individual level human behavior naturally changes as things get bad and also those underground super spreader events are more than likely occurring with the same frequency."
17657,Both things can be true.
17658,Families and friends can be scared to gather and super spreader events like raves can still occur.

17710,So many comments seem to forget that the world is far more than just the USA and Europe and the Biontech and Moderna vaccines couldn’t even vaccinate the whole population of just these areas within the next year.
17711,Never mind the logistical issues with transporting them in a lot of the world due to the temperature requirements.
17712,That’s why people want a 62% vaccine because there isn’t an alternative when you look beyond your own borders.

17718,That's a good question though
17719,"To be fair only 18% of people have said they will not get the vaccine no matter what, and it seems at least another 21% could be swayed."

17726,That's a recipe for compliance.
17727,I made another comment elsewhere (not sure if this thread) basically saying the #1 factor leading to the US's failure has been unity and compliance.

17738,Im not saying everyone who aquires it will have long term effects just saying that it may cause chronic fatigue syndrome like in mono.

17751,"Not great, but not end of the world either."
17752,It doesn't cause worse illness and the vaccines are effective against it.

17773,"There is no data at all on long term effects, which could include things like ADE."
17774,These vaccines were rushed to market.
17775,"I understand why, but the tradeoff is a lack of sound safety data that concerns me."
17776,I’ll gladly hold off on traveling until/if these vaccines are shown to be safe and effective longer term.
17777,It’s unfortunate that having concerns around a lack of data is “anti science” or “anti vax” these days.

17850,"yeah, i mean there's always the chance of a ""perfect storm"" pandemic coming along that mutates like crazy, is 10x more contagious than COVID, and has a 3% IFR."
17851,doesn't mean it's gonna happen though.
17852,"H5N1 and H7N9 are definitely something to be concerned about, but they're also easier to develop a vaccine for and lethal enough to be taken more seriously and also to limit how quickly they can spread."
17853,remember those memes from back in March about the sudden need to travel being a symptom of covid?
17854,yeah you're not gonna have that shit with a disease that carries a 30% IFR.
17855,the WHO needs to describe what this disease could look like and what steps can be taken to prevent it if they're gonna issue dire proclamations like this.
17856,this is why they've been steadily losing credibility throughout the pandemic.
17857,they also pulled some kind of number out of their ass about what it will cost for the world to prevent the next pandemic and didn't say anything about where they got that number or what it included.
17858,(note: that number is also less than 2% of the US Military budget.
17859,maybe we should be going after shit like the military industrial complex instead of panicking and building our fallout shelters for COVID-25 or whatever).
17860,the Washington Post has been especially awful when it comes to mindlessly regurgitating this nonsense too.
17861,"just today they ran a story on vaccination that mindlessly repeated the CDC numbers on how many we've vaccinated, and didn't bother to mention that those numbers are way behind the actual total to the point where several states don't even have data available yet!"
17862,"media traffic has been at an all time high in 2020 because people are confused, scared, and desperate and the big corporate profit-driven outlets absolutely want this to continue."
17863,interspersing little kernels of hopeful news with waves of all-out scare-mongering and doom and gloom is a very effective way for them to do this.
17864,look up intermittent reinforcement and its role in gambling addictions if you don't believe me on this because media outlets absolutely use the same tactics.
17865,hopefully this year has taught at least a few people to evaluate the information they're consuming a little more critically.
17866,The state or DeSantis?
17867,This is the fuel to the skeptic wing.
17868,People are losing jobs and bankrupting and this has no effect in the number of people dying of covid anyway.

17870,"&gt; And there were plenty of ""mask slackers."""
17871,"Yup, and they would be fined if caught"
17872,"this has probably been here for a while tbh, its important to remember there seems to be no evidence it will not respond to the vaccine and there is no proof that it is any more virulent that everything we have been dealing with"
17873,That doesn't prove anything though since many unvaccinsted people also have mild cases compared to the ones seen in the ER.
17874,We don't have the data to say if the severity of infection is weaker for people that are part way through the vaccination schedule

18120,&gt; 4 weeks of sick pay per year is pretty damn generous by US standards.
18121,"It is, indeed."
18122,But in the place I work (and I'm guessing a lot of places).. some of the benefits are based on seniority (years at the company).
18123,"I've been there about 15 years,."
18124,so I'm into the upper 50% of what I can earn for time off.

18219,Somehow it never struck me as being a needed item.
18220,Yeah I'm convinced this is why nursing homes are the canary in the coal mine.
18221,"A lot more ""healthy"" people have had it and were asymptomatic."
18222,Not the case for nearly anyone in a nursing home.
18223,"So we're still at the ""kinda figure you can't"" part of my last response, just fyi."
18224,I think this is a really hard ask .
18225,.
18226,.
18227,forego the opportunity to receive a vaccine by the end of March (for most people) for a 2/3 chance of receiving an active vaccine.
18228,"I would participate in a trial versus another vaccine, but I can't see enrolling in this trial."
18229,"Even if I had young and healthy adult children, I wouldn't recommend they participate in this trial."
18230,It's in response to the following question.
18231,"""I’m anxious to visit my parents, but I’m wondering how safe it is to fly right now."
18232,"With all the talk about the virus being airborne, how dangerous is the re-circulated air in the cabin?"
18233,Is it worth booking with an airline that blocks middle seats?
18234,"And are there other risks I’m not even considering?"""
18235,Direct from the article.

18243,"No new symptomatic cases and 300 asymptomatic cases (detection rate 0.303/10,000, 95% CI 0.270–0.339/10,000) were identified."

18247,They spent 3 days staying in a hotel and going to the parks.
18248,wtf???
18249,I was shocked when I found out.
18250,"I don't even feel safe going into the grocery store, much less an airport and crowded planes right before Christmas when everyone is traveling."
18251,Maybe at least wait until the holiday travel rush is over?!
18252,I do not understand.
18253,Even doctors have doctors.
18254,The first rule of medicine is you do not self-diagnose.
18255,Went to high school with a dude named Eric who ended up being my roommate in college.
18256,He was a decent dude but that was the last time I ever met one that was worth a damn.
18257,&gt;you need to go find evidence for my claim that I made.
18258,It's easy I promise.
18259,Is this real life?
18260,The real mvp.
18261,It's taking too long for him to be president
18262,"Oh dang, sorry man, I had a brainfart."
18263,I for some reason assumed you were talking about the illnesses tne Spanish invaders brought into the new world.
18264,"Did not even know about those epidemics, so thank you for teaching me something new today and apologies for my false remark!"
18265,Isnt it kinda scary how we we are policing eachother ?
18266,"If anyone goes in public without a mask, we film them resisting people telling this person to put a mask on."
18267,"I've seen countless photos of people without masks in a group.. looks fine to me.. but in the eyes of othere, everyone is telling their mommy."
18268,To me this censorship is far more of a threat than coronavirus.
18269,"This isn't a new thing, anyone travelling until the 90's would have carried a Yellow book, stamped with vaccination history."
18270,It used to be you couldn't travel enter certain countries if your vaccinations weren't in order.

18275,"600 is alot for some people, and for those who it is, they wouldn’t spend 1200 on a couch when you can get a decent one from a discount furniture store for 300."
18276,See the other replies.
18277,Its like me complaining I can’t afford a ferrari making 40k/year.
18278,Because its bullshit.
18279,Every flu case is called covid so the hospital can make more money on it.
18280,Stopped by who?
18281,TSA?
18282,Do they have the authority/right to do that?
18283,"And if you fail to report a non wearer, you can also be criminally charged."
18284,Social pressure is how SA stopped public smoking overnight...this will work.
18285,I don't understand why airline companies aren't asking for a negative test before flying.
18286,"I flew two weeks ago (I'm pregnant and moving back to my home country, there was no chance I could wait til after the pandemic and I wasn't going to have my baby abroad) so I took a rapid test the day before my flight, but nobody asked to see it."
18287,"I had three transfers, so three times the chance of catching it."

18297,Had to go to work with a horrific migraine one day.
18298,I work in an office now and luckily I have sick time but I still use too much of it for migraines... :/
18299,&gt; So when they have killed enough people they will get bored of it and move onto their next conspiracy theories.
18300,This statement does not make any sense and is simply inflammatory.
18301,We are talking about the situation where people refuse a vaccine not about people refusing to social distance.
18302,Right now it is academic to talk about the deeds of hose who do not want to get vaccinated as there are not enough vaccine dosages yet to vaccinate the general population.
18303,By the time the vaccine is generally available most of those objectors will have made a change of heart.
18304,Fuck EVERYTHING about that.
18305,I hope you’re okay now!
18306,"Nah, you’re so wrong."
18307,"We started vaccinating on 14 December, two weeks ago."
18308,At 1% per week it will be November 2022 before we get this group finished.
18309,"I don’t actually think it will take that long, our reporting stinks and more vaccines will come on line."
18310,But the initial roll out reports are SLOWWWWW
18311,Italy got hammered first before people knew what was going on.
18312,Can’t speak for spain.
18313,Uk’s Boris Johnson is a wannabe trump with similar issues.
18314,"Are you really going to try to ignore that trump basically let the virus run wild in this country, and does so still to this day?"
18315,"And are you going to deny that trumpism’s anti-intellectual, anti-science bullshit are not at fault?"
18316,Or that he and his administration have been seeing covid as a largely political issue from the beginning?
18317,"It isn't so much that they died for a haircut, but that they died for *that* haircut."
18318,Hey that was me recovering from Covid and then being near a maskless moron who just got off a plane!
18319,Guess who started feeling sick again a few days later?
18320,"Doctors: “Yeah your immune system only had 7 weeks to bounce back before you were in the same room as that dipshit, sorry.”"
18321,I think dying is a lot more miserable than wearing a mask.
18322,You dont agree?
18323,When they say “stay at home” do they really mean have dinner with friends in Napa?
18324,"Yeah, nurse here: this is the interview that left me frustrated and shaking my head."
18325,It’s also the big talking point I hear patients talking about when we push wearing masks.
18326,Dr. Fauci really did drop the ball on this interview.
18327,"This year influenza killed far, far fewer than normal in the US."
18328,"It’s week 51 of the tracking year - we’ve only had 720 total positive flu cases out of 319,000 tests."
18329,"Last year by Week 51 we had 31,350 total positive cases out of 358,000 tests."
18330,"Given a more effective vaccine (they’re working on several new approaches) and a higher percentage of vaccine uptake, we could virtually eliminate deaths from flu."
18331,Leaving more medical resources for treating new viruses.
18332,Can someone explain to me how this vaccine is causing symptoms?
18333,"Most vaccines have weakened versions of the virus in them, so I understand how those could cause symptoms of being sick."
18334,"But this is an mRNA vaccine, with no virus present."
18335,"It’s supposed to be a messenger, with instructions on what spike proteins look like (as far as I know)."
18336,How on earth is that causing symptoms of COVID?
18337,It seems impossible.
18338,"ELI5, please!"
18339,Fuck her if she’s flying during a pandemic.
18340,I was in Urgent Care for a bad ear infection about two weeks ago.
18341,I made a quick appointment online and got to cut a lot of the line.
18342,There were dozens of people trying to get a Covid test to travel and they were coming in groups.
18343,The wait was close to two hours and they were all pissed off people w actual medical issues were getting to go in first.
18344,"One guy threw a hissyfit that they couldn't just write on the paper that he wasn't sick, bc he was going out of the country with or without it."
18345,Felt awful for the nurses dealing w this shit.
18346,"Finally after 9 months of worrying about her safety, my nurse mother just got the notification that she can now schedule her COVID shot!"
18347,"With my brother and father both on the moderna trial and clearly getting the vaccine, I can sleep so much easier knowing that this nightmare is about to finally end for my close family."
18348,Next up is my 90-year-old grandmother!
18349,The end is finally in sight ladies and gentlemen!
18350,We can really start to dream of a proper summer!
18351,Every western country has a similar faction of far right COVID deniers.
18352,The only difference is the size of this group relative to the entire population.

18796,Who are you to dictate if I should use condoms or plan B lmao it’s my vagina.
18797,Fucking trolling.
18798,We gotta start speaking up.
18799,Things are getting even more ridiculous.
18800,"I'm in pharmacy, back when we first started doing immunizations we had to manually log the data, this could take about 20 mins per patient."
18801,It was brutal and data lagged a lot because we just didn't have the time.
18802,Now it's automatic and isn't as bad but I would assume the data being slow is due to manual input of data.
18803,Which requires a lot.
18804,Here's what all we had to report for flu vaccines.
18805,"Name

Dob

Address

Ph#

Gender

Race

Nationality

Maiden name

Patients PCP name

Known allergies

Name of vaccine

Manufacturer

Lot number

Expiration date

Injection site

Any reaction within 15min of administration (this would take a second report which we still do and is exceptionally long)"
18806,I’ve heard the opposite as well.
18807,"Fever, sore throat and they were confident they had COVID but never got tested."
18808,Don't forget gender programs in Pakistan for whatever reason
18809,Lol the Chinese government has done that negative PR spin well enough without Bloomberg’s help.
18810,You're lumping presymptomatic and asymptomatic transmission into one with that statement.
18811,Sure but that only affects whites so who's going to take up that cause?
18812,This isn’t news.
18813,They only got their first dose and it’s 94% effective.
18814,There are going to be 6% of people that still get covid.
18815,We’ve vaccinated 2 million people ... there’s going to be cases.
18816,I just found out about it and I feel like that’s crazy.
18817,They must be the first places in the country (possibly the world???)
18818,to openly distribute these vaccines to the wider public
18819,"One of my coworkers got sent home for either a positive test, or possible exposure, right before Christmas."
18820,I asked my manager what the deal was(my grandma is in her 90s and has been on oxygen for well over a year).
18821,"Was basically told ""go pound sand, we cant tell you shit cuz HIPAA, we deemed you safe from our CCTV contact tracing."
18822,"""(there are no cameras in our backroom where we do a lot of our work, unloading trucks/inventory/dishes/etc)

So I've spent the last 12 days, self-quarantining for the sake of my parents/grandparents."
18823,"Missed Christmas, and had to facetime them because I don't trust my employer."
18824,"Still have been going to work(need the money)because I'm no longer culpable, but not fucking around with my family/parents."
18825,Administering a vaccine is the easiest thing ever.
18826,They could offer a 2 hour workshop and enlist volunteers.
18827,Kinda like poll workers for elections.
18828,"Have one real nurse on site to supervise, and in case someone has a negative reaction, along with 5 volunteers."
18829,"Presto, you've boosted your capacity to administer shots by 5x"
18830,Agreed with deplaning.
18831,That policy should be strictly enforced.
18832,&gt;There was a report showing the CCP used bots to shape the narrative to be extremely pro-lockdown in March.
18833,Absolute bullshit.
18834,Provide a source.
18835,Lockdowns were called for by public health officials to prevent hospitals from overflowing.
18836,Italy locked down way before anyone in the US was calling for it.
18837,You know why?
18838,"Because italy was facing massive spikes in cases and deaths, and their hospitals were overflowing."
18839,"Regardless of his politics (which are awful), this is just an example of yet another person learning only by first hand experience."

18851,"I don't even think they line up with the CDC recommendations, but I haven't looked that hard for the exact CDC ones because they mean nothing to anyone outside of a state planning office."
18852,"So, yeah, if you want to talk about some third party recommendations, sure, I guess that's what they are recommending."
18853,But actual states?
18854,Haven't seen many states following those recommendations.

18874,"Those who don’t wear them properly should be deplaned, even if it means redirecting the flight to remove them from the flight."

18890,Spend more time reading than calling people responding to other posts as batshit insane posts.
18891,Yeah cops may not care a fuck about you or me.
18892,They care about the fines they will earn from enforcing mask laws.
18893,Its all about money for most of them anyway.
18894,Right?
18895,Or do you think all of them are idiots for not believing in using masks to protect themselves from all the mouth-breathing ignorant people similar to you?
18896,I see more cops in masks than general public.
18897,Florida had already been hit extremely hard during the summer.
18898,NOT TRUE!
18899,Perks such as playing world police and shitting everywhere around the world while letting people at home suffer.

18905,The hospital I’m at has so many “overflow” areas it’s hard to get to them all.
18906,They are working on another 26 bed wing to avoid having to transfer out.
18907,If they transfer too many out then they’ll have to cancel elective surgeries.
18908,It’s surreal how the areas families and the worried well are staying are calm and empty.
18909,Then you badge your way through some doors and total mayhem.

18912,What state are you in?
18913,Yes glad we agree.
18914,Everything you have said doesn’t disprove the existence of responsible capitalism.
18915,It exists.
18916,It’s in use to a certain extent.
18917,Do you even understand that article or did you just read the headlines?
18918,"Food deserts are real, and that article in no way challenges that."
18919,But it does point out that folks living within reach of well-stock groceries can still be obese so its not necessarily the only cause of the problem and more likely due to bad eating habits.
18920,But it also goes on explain that bad eating habits are a result of our own lifestyle experiences.
18921,"Fact is food deserts are very much real, and people who grew up eating a lot of processed foods aren't suddenly going to change their eating habits just cos fresh food is suddenly within reach."
18922,Old habits die hard.
18923,It requires fixing more than just access to fresh foods.
18924,"It requires proper education on nutrition, and a willingness to pushback against the soft drink and junk food industry that has a powerful political lobby behind it."
18925,But it doesn't change that food deserts are still a problem.
18926,See my other comment here where I went more in depth and through some scholarly research.

18929,"back in the 90s, i went to college in the states from canada - i was required to get a Tb, Hep-c and some other vaccines before they issued me my student visa."
18930,Which unfortunately only applies if the business has  50 to 499 employees.
18931,Small and large businesses are exempt.
18932,"According to the article, that 100 million was going to be the second batch after the one they delivered this month, so the US may not be getting more from Pfizer until after they fulfill other contracts."
18933,"That said, Pfizer isn’t the only company with a vaccine."
18934,Mostly considering I would say more young people are healthcare workers than not.
18935,Some doctors are obviously losers but you usually don’t see nurses that old still working imo.
18936,All good bro.
18937,Sorry I called you an ass further up.
18938,Talking about what I was in the comment thread gets me pretty heated and depressed all at once.
18939,"Not about this, but about my dad and the vaccine thing."
18940,"Have a good New Year, my friend!"
18941,Same goes for the US cases too
18942,"Yeah, there's a brigade downvoting any ""bad news"" on this sub, as if it will change reality."

18945,I do what the government tells me to.
18946,It has a powerful influence on me.
18947,It’s easier for me to just quarantine for 14 days than it is to get tested.
18948,"For all the sites here, I have to do an interview or get a referral, then I can get tested."
18949,They are all far away and wait times are high.
18950,My wife got a positive test a week ago and has been in isolation from both myself and our son.
18951,"I wanted to at least give us a chance to not get it, but I’m starting to show symptoms."
18952,"I’d love to get tested to know for sure, but I can’t leave my kid with anyone and get them sick."
18953,"The last thing I want is to drag him, who puts his mouth on everything, into a doctors office to be tested."
18954,"So 24 day quarantine it is, which is easier and less risky"
18955,It's insulting to Republicans who don't think it's a hoax and it just creates more division in an already divided country.
18956,Because people like to be on their high horses for “doing their part” but becoming hermits during this time.
18957,"All I did was post a study (the actual study not a website synopsis either) but here we are

18959,This makes a lot of sense.
18960,"I didn't know WV started nursing homes so early, that's amazing!"
18961,I hope the 38 states that started today can follow a similar timeline.
18962,The infected people who were welded in their homes also weren’t allowed medical treatment.
18963,Can’t overcrowd the hospitals if COVID patients aren’t allowed medical care.

18969,"Shouldn’t have eaten those cookies, just die."
18970,Heart attack and stroke among obese people?
18971,Stay and home and rot or die.
18972,That logic pretty much defeats the whole point of the preventative measures we’re trying to implement.
18973,"If we don’t care if people die, what’s the point of even trying?"
18974,"Other than to make our numbers and success look good to the rest of the world, AKA a certain country."
18975,Yeah since I'm a college student and don't even fucking get the stimulus checks I will gladly take a box of bananas right now
18976,Is it being tracked in any way yet?
18977,This article is more about illegal immigrants but I'm wondering if other people getting it are getting it noted?
18978,Ummmm....maybe?
18979,"But I can’t help but reflect on the the staggering number of covid-related deaths in the skilled nursing facility world (where a very high percentage of our patients take melatonin regularly), and wonder if “major” might be a bit of an editorial exaggeration."
18980,"But,TBD!"
18981,"*orders more melatonin, just in case"
18982,Most likely numerical fluke.
18983,These studies involve tens of thousands but when you look at number of infections in the 2 month period right after vaccination I’m sure it’s single digits.
18984,"Edit: considering it was less then 20 vaccinated people who got sick, I’m guessing it’s 2 people got diagnosed then, maybe 1, lol"
18985,That’s awesome news!
18986,North Central West Virginian here.

18988,I’ve witnessed too many people ignoring precautionary measures.

19004,These vaccines have not been proven to make you non infectious though.

19083,You don't really need to vaccinate health care workers to see deaths declining.
19084,"With all the PPE available at most places, healthcare workers are much better protected than the spring."
19085,There are tons of low risk health care workers getting the vaccine that won't change deaths at all.
19086,Now if you want to say LTC workers than that would help as they can slow the spread to residents but generally speaking about healthcare workers won't change a ton.

19138,I have corona and I can barely move from bed.
19139,A couple things on this.
19140,1) Enough with the false dichotomies.
19141,I was literally ranting about that under this exact comment.
19142,"There's nothing Americans love to do more than take extreme, absurd positions on issues and label everything who disagrees in any way, shape, or form as morally inferior."
19143,2) The slippery-slope argument is ridiculous.
19144,We've been making judgement calls on what to open since this thing began.
19145,We're humans— we have that capacity.
19146,"""When does the opening up end?"""
19147,"Presumably, right about when more people are dying as a result of the opening than from the life-shattering economic consequences."
19148,"A low bar, but certainly not zero like many of my fellow Democrats seem to believe it is."
19149,"3) As for sit-down specifically, in most parts of the country, it is warm enough to have outdoor dining."
19150,In those places I'd advocate for a shut-down indoor but open outdoor model.
19151,"The problem is that where I live, Philly and New York, the cities are absolutely crumbling because inner-city families cannot provide for themselves."
19152,"They don't have the space for outdoor, and even if they did, it's far too cold for that to be a viable option."
19153,Indoor dining is somewhat risky but it is generally not high-risk as you suggested.
19154,This info is coming straight from my doctor.
19155,"In my opinion, in the northeast and upper midwest, that is unfortunately a trade off we're going to need to make."
19156,These places aren't gonna last 6 more months.

19158,"Everyone with a brain (mostly Democrats these days, although even a broken republican is right twice a day) understands this."
19159,"That being said, we cannot rely on stimulus to move money through the economy by itself."
19160,"If we could, we'd just do that in non-Covid times and declare ourselves communist."
19161,Note: NOT calling you a communist.
19162,I'm not Kelly Loeffler.
19163,Where does it say it's half dose/full dose + 3 months?

19167,"-&gt; not all capitalist businesses operate under ""responsible capitalism""
-&gt; responsible capitalism does not come from any or all capitalist businesses, it would specifically come from a large trend in *many* capitalist businesses operating in a responsible manner, or at least more responsible manner than which it is operating currently."
19168,Having a single just business does not redeem capitalism.
19169,-&gt; literal historical documentation of business cycles from capitalist's and capitalist supporters own perspectives on the cycle (RE: why companies that did not ship out labor to cheaper areas of the world lose out more often than those who were willing to use slave labor abroad to cut costs) even bemoan that the more ethical solutions under capitalism are a death sentence to business

19178,I tried CVS earlier in the summer.
19179,"It was super easy to get a test scheduled, no questions asked, but it took a hot minute to get results back."
19180,I think it took a little over 3 days to get a result.
19181,"Granted, this was all back during the summer/early fall."
19182,I could imagine that getting a test now isn't quite as easy or quick.
19183,"It's 1-3 weeks after the first shot, it's different for everybody."
19184,It's also been reported that you get 90% effectiveness after the first and there has been chatter if the 2nd is truly necessary or if it's better to double capacity but both trials were run and approved on two doses so it would take another trial and approval from what I understand but the data doesn't show losing effectiveness quicker with a single shot.

19269,So the 95% result seems to be from a sub-group of a sub-group?
19270,Half-dose/full-dose AND second dose received within 3 months.
19271,Unclear how many cases this was based on.

19398,No
19399,Explain to me how a virus would shed from me onto another person... if my body has killed the virus inside me because of the vaccine?
19400,From CDC website:  There is not enough information currently available to say if or when CDC will stop recommending that people wear masks and avoid close contact with others to help prevent the spread of the virus that causes COVID-19.
19401,Experts need to understand more about the protection that COVID-19 vaccines provide before making that decision.

19403,"No, we wouldn't know."

19406,I find it extremely unconvincing.
19407,Good idea for people who've never been infected?

19417,"No access for other essential workers except for 1,000 doses available only for Bergen County residents who are heathcare workers only."

19683,"It’s pretty easy to not rape people, just like how it’s easy to wear a mask."
19684,Do you by any chance have some of those articles?
19685,I would love to read up on them!
19686,No?
19687,"I guess I'm ignorant about this but the question that always bugs me with this topic is, why do we keep hammering this idea that people only care about something that they can physically see?"
19688,We don't need to see a suffering child in person to care about children.
19689,"Heck, this pandemic has proven that even when people have loved ones dying and suffering from a scientifically proven virus, they will refuse to take it seriously."
19690,"It's one thing to keep the most endangered, struggling animals in a zoo for the purpose of conservation only, but there are lots of zoos that contain several hundreds of animals that aren't endangered."
19691,Do accredited zoos always hold up to their strict restrictions to ensure they are only causing the bare minimum discomfort to the animals?
19692,Apparently dementia patients are dying in droves too.

19699,"What about my family's anxiety about health, on top of the isolation that we're also experiencing?"
19700,And then the blasé responses to how children aren't really affected and people can just get vaccines.
19701,There are children who are at higher risk and children cannot get vaccines.
19702,Ugh.
19703,"So glad I'm not in the US anymore, and am where covid is under control and people are able to get their shit together for their communities."
19704,"My guess is worldwide, but could be both."
19705,I think a combination of the holiday catch up and the number of new available hosts declining will make it happen then.
19706,"FYI 
Here in Australia we have such a small number of covid cases  that they do 100% virus gene testing routinely."
19707,"So if a person visited a restaurant and caught covid they confirm that they actually caught it at the restaurant and not somewhere else, like an international pilot, by comparing the virus genes."
19708,The concern is that new sources like international travellers in quarantine will get out into the community.
19709,There is currently only one variant in the wild but several have been identified in returning international travellers
19710,Corruption or incompetence... Or desire to appear strong on the world stage.
19711,Shrug.
19712,They’re not jacking the clerk they’re jacking the cash register because it’s full of cash.
19713,"A nurse or EMT is highly unlikely to have any cash on them while on the job, maybe a few bucks."
19714,A cash register will easily have a few hundred bucks.
19715,What are you even trying to argue here?
19716,Doesn’t make a lot of sense
19717,Agreed.
19718,That said there were signs of leveling off and trending downwards as early as December 10th-ish.
19719,If Xmas travel didn't screw us I think we really are on a down trend caused by individual decisions and probably some immunity reducing spread

19739,&gt; Dr. Ramers says he knows of several other local cases where health care workers became infected around the time they received the vaccine.
19740,He says all the cases illustrate the fact that results aren’t immediate.
19741,"Even after you start receiving some protection, it won't be full protection."

19758,So what’s your point?
19759,"I’m also aware the government had nothing to do with the development and manufacturing of the vaccine I have, the extent of their involvement was they bought doses, so I’m not sure what your point is there but the paranoia and misinformation is pretty astonishing for two sentences."
19760,"Also, and Jesus I can’t even believe I have to say this, not only is the efficacy 95%, probably a little lower with the new variant, but there is a portion of any population who won’t be able to receive the vaccine, immunocompromised for example."
19761,"So I repeat, why on earth would any country want some weak ass pansy who’s afraid of modern medicine and science in their country to spread a virus to its population?"

19774,She even advocated others do this as it fits in with her moral and political philosophy exactly so there’s zero hypocrisy even if it weren’t a lie.
19775,As the article says even after the second shot you have a 95% chance of immunity.
19776,There is still a 1 roll on a 20 sided dice (5%) that you can still get it.
19777,People would react different that's for sure.
19778,But seems pretty unlikely that healthy people would be more impacted than unhealthy people...
19779,&gt;Holy fuck.

19782,That's awful.
19783,"I mean, I never used the word ""rights,"" because sick leave and vacation aren't rights here."
19784,"They're ""benefit options"" given at the discretion of the business."
19785,Most Americans (generally) know how fucked we are here with sick time and vacation and healthcare (and other stuff).
19786,"Most Americans wish it could be made better, and many actively push for it."
19787,"But a significant portion of those who admit it's bad also believe any other option is *worse* because they're a part of a reverse cargo cult that thinks every country that says ""this works better"" is lying and it doesn't work better they just want to ""drag America down"" or some shit."
19788,"They admit what we have is bad, but are afraid other options are worse."
19789,And so nothing happens.
19790,It's depressing.
19791,I've wanted to leave the USA for 20 years but it just doesn't seem like it's ever going to happen.
19792,"Hell at this point I can't even vacation anywhere but at home, let alone flying back to Europe or Oz one day."
19793,"I don’t think it’s a case of the US letting the virus in, it’s absolutely rampaging through the country and shutting the borders won’t do a damn thing (apart from preventing infected people in the US taking it to other countries which is always a plus)"
19794,They never promised 100% effective.
19795,Particularly with only one dose of the vaccine.
19796,Is this supposed to scare us away from the jab on the basis that it doesn’t work?
19797,Because I’m fairly certain that a similar control group of unvaccinated ER nurses would have much more than *one* Covid positive...
19798,Exactly.
19799,Also before getting the 2nd dose.
19800,If anything this is a reminder to people they still have to be careful for several weeks post vaccination and not rip the mask off immediately after.
19801,"exactly, it's propaganda creating a strawman argument to bully us into taking it."
19802,In my country you only get a look of disgust for not wearing a mask.
19803,It doesn’t matter your health status.
19804,It matters the health status of the person next to you at the grocery store.
19805,Think about someone other than yourself.
19806,"And yes, we should all continue socially distancing until the vaccines roll out to the general public."
19807,Where are there expensive fines for not wearing a mask actually being given out.
19808,&gt;before being vaccinated.
19809,or after or during
19810,And till now they're still denying border closuure to non- residents-non-goods (with some exceptions)
19811,You are right.
19812,In Germany it is not expected that younger people can get the vaccine before summer even if they wanted to.
19813,[removed]
19814,[deleted]
19815,See i like this but how do we expect this to be enforced?
19816,We need to explain to the people why the mask is important but whats really important is follow the advice of all experts.
19817,We are all in this together so we have to listen to the people smarter than us on this one.
19818,We can't allow the false narrative that humanity is right or wrong.
19819,We need to explain that there is no right and wrong ways to have an opinion but one of them is backed by experts.
19820,Remember you have to relate to the people who won't do the bare minimum that they have been told who to fear and what to fear their entire life so if someone is told second hand that the virus is fake or masks are dangerous it just means they were misinformed.
19821,Governments and the corrupt want you to live in fear when we should live in love and harmony.

19833,"Only thing is that you need to get a doctor's note if you call in 5 or more days in a row, but that's it."
19834,"And even if you're calling in multiple days in a row, it's only considered one absence."
19835,I never said to relax the other restrictions.
19836,"Mandatory mask wearing enforced and in conjunction with social distancing is enough to eradicate the virus, as shown by various successful, actually competent countries (read: not the USA)."
19837,"Exactly why we need the 2nd amendment, you should move to communist china if you desire to be such a huge lover of big pharma propaganda and we will protect our liberty to not take an experimental and unproven vaccine however we need to thank you very much."
19838,That's an interesting detail that the articles I read have left out.
19839,That explains why experts aren't discarding the current vaccine for the new variant yet.
19840,When you mentioned monoclonal antibodies I assume you're talking about those you develop after infection right?
19841,In the USA or worldwide?
19842,In USA its been Wednesdays for awhile now so if gonna be this week it'll probably be Wednesday not tomorrow.
19843,Worldwide I think it'll climb for awhile still
19844,"seriously though, is scientific american actually interested in doing any debunking?"

19851,Well done!
19852,It’s now reached Australia (in hotel quarantine) and we are hardly taking any people into the country (generally only Aussies and immediate family) so guaranteed it’s been in the US for some time.
19853,I have a feeling that people who says things like that don’t understand that all people will die.
19854,Sitting next to someone with the virus even if you both have masks is no guarantee at all that you won’t contract it.
19855,"One study suggested a risk of 30% over 12 hours vs 90% — much better, but still high risk."

19866,Our president also addressed this months ago in one of his addresses to the nation.
19867,"He said you don't need a mask - you can literally use a scarf, item of clothing, piece of fabric just to wrap around."
19868,But you need to cover your nose and mouth and there is no excuse.
19869,Also places like the blood banks have been giving masks if you donate blood and some places and people have been handing them out for free to poorer communities.
19870,Marginalized folks will be affected worse if they are unable to access medical care as all the state facilities are full and they cannot even begin to afford private hospitals.
19871,But every health department has.
19872,This is just dumb.
19873,"The various companies that make this stuff came out and told us the same months ago... people seem to just ignore what is said as they cannot tolerate any deviation from idea that “vaccines are the solution and will sort the problem 100%, everyone must get a jab, no matter what!!"

19892,"No data to suggest either that compliance was much better there or that compliance was what resulted in their low COVID burden, just pulled straight of your ass."
19893,You then tell us that the only justification for mitigation measures is to prevent hospital overload.
19894,"If that's indeed the case, then every country is doing fine - aside from a few local hotspots ICUs are generally managing fine."
19895,So the US or Europe aren't faring any worse than Vietnam or NZ as long as their hospitals aren't collapsing.

19917,I still live in my home city so I didn't need to travel in public otherwise I would have isolated and tested or simply not traveled.
19918,Now I'm in in a circumstance where I was able to travel home that many people are not in.
19919,Because I work in an essential service I had no opportunity to use much of my annual leave during the year so was able to isolate at my place and living in my home city meant I could get home without mixing with the public.

20008,"[The 3 month gaps came from the UK trials due to lack of supplies](https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(20)32661-1/fulltext):

&gt;In participants who received two standard doses, efficacy against primary symptomatic COVID-19 was consistent in both the UK (60·3% efficacy) and Brazil (64·2% efficacy), indicating these results are generalisable across two diverse settings with different timings for the booster dose (***with most participants in the UK receiving the booster dose more than 12 weeks after the first dose*** and most participants in Brazil receiving their second dose within 6 weeks of the first)."
20009,"Exploratory subgroup analyses included at the request of reviewers and editors also showed no significant difference in efficacy estimates when comparing those with a short time window between doses (&lt;6 weeks) and those with longer (≥6 weeks), although further detailed exploration of the timing of doses might be warranted."

20019,"Now I've been jabbed, hopefully the rest of covid for me should be boring and little impact in terms of my health - a complete anticlimax."
20020,"That slight tenderness should be my only personal feeling of Covid illness and although I've become one of those who will stop the spread, it's not like I've suddenly got remarkable supper powers, the vaccine has increased my muscle mass to make me a super mutant athlete or I now see in infrared too."

20112,The liposome in the vaccine can act as a psuedo adjuvant that attracts antigen presenting cells and T cells that release cytokines which causes local and “global” inflammation.

20526,I wonder how they got the second positive result?
20527,Did they just do a swab?
20528,"Because at our hospital we were part of a study where we tested blood and nasal swabs for antigens, antibodies, and then the virus."
20529,"So of the ones I did (I’m a nurse and only can speak of the patients who I cared for) we would have positive covid tests, but no antigens, and then the antibodies were of good levels."
20530,Some of these people had their original positive covid test from months ago.
20531,"I know one person who has had over 10 positive tests since June, yet only had minor symptoms back then."
20532,"So what if one of these people got ill again, then covid tested and obviously showed a positive, even though they may have another virus causing symptoms, but which wasn’t tested for?"
20533,They would have to test for ALL the different viruses and see if it was just covid causing the issues.
20534,"Hopefully before calling it a second for sure 100% covid infection, they rule these possibilities out."

20546,The infections are going up exactly as many thought it would in winter.
20547,Seems strange that so many people are essentially claiming the explosion in cases is specifically due to the new strain.

20832,"I mean, Russia is gonna Russia."
20833,Czernobyl happened the way it did for a Reason.
20834,This is essentially the same scenario.
20835,Russian Politicians (especially Putin) still carry oldschool KGB indoctrination.
20836,"Protect the State and Image of your Nation at all costs, your Nations fate might depend on it."
20837,"In other Words, Modern Russian Politicians still have sentiments from the Soviet Parties  Apparatchik  crowd."

20839,"Because we as a Nation cannot afford to show any form of weakness, our survival depends on it."

20841,This is probably one of those cases.
20842,As was Czernobyl.

20857,I have herpes and can confirm the CDC is not tracking those of us with HSV2.
20858,I was never required to contact partners or notified I will be put into any database.
20859,"Instead, testing for herpes is discouraged unless symptoms are present due to the psychological damage being worse than the disease itself because of the stigma."
20860,The numbers presented for people with herpes are grossly inaccurate amd under counted due to the CDC's very own recommendations.
20861,Wouldn’t testing everyone stop the spread of genital herpes?
20862,We don’t know.
20863,There is no evidence that diagnosing genital herpes with a blood test in someone without symptoms would change their sexual behavior and stop the virus from spreading.
20864,"In addition, without knowing the benefits of testing, the risk of shaming and stigmatizing people outweighs the potential benefits."
20865,"For these reasons, testing everyone for herpes is not recommended at this time."

20867,I came home with the flu one year after a plane ride and gave it to my brother.
20868,He developed viral myocarditis and suddenly died.
20869,"I think this is a very realistic expectation, I’m wondering at that point (maybe mid February??)"
20870,if we will start seeing a big divergence in the number of deaths vs case count.
20871,"In other words, the population that is much more susceptible to complications will be largely immune, which will cause deaths to fall off, however the generally (heathy) public will still not be immune yet leading to continued high case counts."
20872,Reddit doesn’t generate a username
20873,Well stop me if you want but the data is there.
20874,[Here](https://reason.com/2020/09/29/the-latest-cdc-estimates-of-covid-19s-infection-fatality-rate-vary-dramatically-with-age/) is another more recent article that makes the same points.
20875,- IFR varies from 0.1 percent in Utah to 1.4 percent in Connecticut.
20876,- IFR varies from 0.003 percent among people 19 or younger to 5.4 percent among people in their 70s.
20877,"- COVID-19, while not nearly as lethal as many people initially feared, is about six times as deadly as the seasonal flu."
20878,"But as with the flu, the risk is highest for the elderly

Because of the way the risk is skewed, young people are at virtually no risk, while the elderly are at great risk."
20879,"The original article in this post is still misleading because it only considers hospitalized cases, not all cases."
20880,A vast majority (99%+) of people that are infected do not go to the hospital so this article is essentially focusing on about 1% of those that are infected.
20881,"Like I said, you can dig for yourself."
20882,"Science prior to Covid said mask effects were negligible, unless you are talking about N95 level masks, and it hasn't changed."
20883,"Public outcry has changed, with little to no science backing it, because ""common sense""."

20949,A better policy would be to treat it like a speeding ticket.
20950,"It's a very different situation, but it's a similar principle."
20951,"Someone speeding does not intend to kill themselves or others, but they might."
20952,"Someone not wearing a mask also does not intend malice, but they still may harm others."
20953,Not wearing a mask is an error in judgment.
20954,A serious one.
20955,"But an error in judgment nonetheless, rather than an act of outright malice."
20956,A fine would be warranted.
20957,A stern warning and talking to by the courts and doctors would also be warranted.
20958,"Though, giving droves of people a permanent criminal record isn't the answer."
20959,The key is enforcement.
20960,Whatever penalties there are need to be enforced and enforced consistently.
20961,That's the key.
20962,"Even if it's a criminal charge, if the numbers of anti-maskers make it impossible for the law to be enforced, they're still going to refuse masks."
20963,"Unfortunately, the anti-maskers have ""strength in numbers"" going for them."
20964,"Thus, if the number of anti-maskers remains high despite the laws, the police will not be able to keep up with enforcing it."
20965,And only a small portion of the anti-maskers will ever face any penalties.
20966,"\]

In my area, around 10 percent of people walk around in grocery stores and other indoor locations without a mask."
20967,"Then, another 15+ percent of people wear them as chin diapers."
20968,"Depending on the wording of the law, these people may technically be able to skate out of it."
20969,"Because if it simply says ""wear a mask"", these folks technically are."
20970,Except it does not protect them or others.
20971,Sounds like you could have a lawsuit there.
20972,I am going to rely on controlled clinical/ lab studies than poor compliance and self reported data.
20973,How many people are going to lie and say no they weren’t wearing masks.
20974,Studies like these are like diet surveys.
20975,"Also assisted living, I am guessing high comorbidites and less social distancing."
20976,That’s like comparing apples to monkeys.
20977,That’s also like saying how are frontline workers getting covid when they always wear masks!!!
20978,Exposure volume and non compliance at times.
20979,Some people are always at higher risk.

20989,Last week I was on a 16 hour flight from Doha to LA and felt very safe the whole time.
20990,"Everybody wore masks, FAs were on top of calling those out who weren't, face shields were required when boarding and deplaning, fresh masks and bottles of hand sanitizer were given out 2 times during the flight."

21116,It’s a karma-whore account.
21117,You can buy Reddit accounts online and they all have similar usernames “Traditional-Ad-xxxx” (xxxx are random digits)
21118,Couldn't agree more.

21127,I had brain fog for 3 weeks after I got covid.
21128,"I'm 22, healthy and a medical resident."
21129,It was really bad.
21130,I still don't have the same energy levels I used to.

21132,I don’t know anymore.

21136,How many Pfizer doses are going to be delivered in the US in Q2?
21137,Most developed countries bought more vaccines than they needed in case some didn’t work out.
21138,If they all work out then the extra will be distributed through foreign aid programs.
21139,"[Here](https://www.who.int/bulletin/online_first/BLT.20.265892.pdf) is the ""IFR Bulletin"" from the WHO (peer reviewed) which includes the quote ""Across 51 locations, the median COVID-19 infection fatality rate was 0.27% (corrected 0.23%)""."
21140,I am not a scientist or anything but my reading of the analysis is that this is the aggregate number across all of their data sets.
21141,"[Here](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/hcp/planning-scenarios.html) is the data published by the CDC in 5 scenarios, the 5th of which is their ""best estimate"" which shows these IFR's:

    0-19 years: 0.00003
    20-49 years: 0.0002
    50-69 years: 0.005
    70+ years: 0.054

And an aggregate IFR of 0.25%."
21142,"Basically, many scientists and experts believe that about 10 times as many people are being infected with the virus as is being reported because they don't have symptoms."
21143,Which means the *infection* fatality rate is about 10 times less than the *case* fatality rate.
21144,Also 70+ are 1800 times as likely to die as those in the 0-19 age range.
21145,"So if you take that 0.25% fatality rate and adjust it for age, the fatality rate for those below 70 is tiny, far less than the flu and other viruses."
21146,They do if people actually adhere to them and do their part.
21147,People here are behaving as if there is no pandemic.
21148,Yea that’s cuz the vaccine is actually a very small dose of live virus itself.
21149,In which they inject in our body to ensure that we get a 90 day to nine month protection from getting it again.
21150,Study showed small doses of weakening the virus helps create a vaccine.
21151,Because once you get the virus and it leaves your body after the 14 days you’re good from anywhere between  90 days to nine months.
21152,Same!
21153,"Nearly every time I’ve flown I’ve gotten a sinus infection, cold, or flu."
21154,I started wearing masks on planes and disinfecting my seat a couple years before the ‘rona hit.
21155,There’s no way I’m flying during a pandemic in a country with unchecked community spread.
21156,Hitler's painted so evil in hindsight.
21157,"while it was all playing out, he was just a very charismatic speaker who said what people wanted to hear."
21158,None of the atrocities would have happened if he didnt have such a blindly loyal following.
21159,I don't think it's lazy to compare Trump to Hitler.
21160,"They both run on ""a return to greatness"" (change, but change back) with an emphasis on nationalism and patriotism."
21161,They both are both undeniably charismatic and captivating.
21162,They both encouraged their following to take the fight outside of the political ring.
21163,They both were exceptionally narcissistic with a grandiose sense of self.
21164,They were both extremely polarizing - causing an internal divide - either loved or hated.
21165,"They both were hated and viewed as a reckless threat by the rest of the world, in favour of appealing to nationalists."
21166,"They both had a desire to make the biggest and best things, no matter how inefficient or costly or illogical it may be, just for clout."
21167,"I studied Hitler a lot because I wanted to understand how could one man who was so clearly evil have anybody following him, much less an entire army."
21168,"But, no one ever thinks ""this mans a villain, i like him""."
21169,"in their minds, the Nazis saw Hitler as the man who was going to return the German Empire to greatness."
21170,He was able to make them believe what they were doing was right.
21171,Any politician who leads through talk and grandstanding and hype rallies you HAVE to be weary of.
21172,"Good products sell themselves, its no different than politicians."
21173,"Some get support through policies they put forward, some get support for solving problems... but when a politician's support is entirely based on talk and stagelike performance you HAVE to be cautious."
21174,Hitler was Time magazine's Man of The Year at one point.
21175,"He wasn't evil, until he was."
21176,The problem is that study wouldn't need a few years to publish.
21177,There's been cohorts followed since March and April and many results have been published.
21178,Yet nobody reported that their cohort has some sort of statistically significant long term damage.
21179,Its literally as easy as doing weekly phone followups with the first thousand people who tested positive at a busy clinic.
21180,"But yet armed with case studies, people seem to want to argue that long covid is some significant threat."
21181,Death from covid is a threat.
21182,Intubation from covid is a threat.
21183,Long covid has yet to be proven.
21184,Its nothing more than a small group exhibiting heavy post-viral infection damage.
21185,"Essentially bad luck


You dont get to argue for long covid but then decline to submit scientific evidence."
21186,That's my guess too.

21195,Why on the heck is this not a 24/7 operation to get the vaccine out of the freezers and into peoples arms?
21196,This rate seems like quite a failure to me.
21197,No worries at all!!
21198,I wasn’t offended :) just wanted to clarify that I’m not a douche against universal healthcare bc I def wasn’t clear in how I phrased it
21199,"People are ALWAYS dying, you rude asshole."
21200,What would happen if you walked into stores with your dick dangling out of your pants?
21201,"And at least some tiny appendage(don't @ me how its not tiny, no1curr) is just visually offensive, and won't kill people, even if it emotionally traumatizes them, but the consequences would be swift, and severe, and they would arrest you on the spot."
21202,Society would not tolerate it.
21203,Nobody wants to hear about how your dick feels suffocated and your balls get squished when you wear pants.
21204,People would not have sympathy.
21205,Similarly I have absolutely zero sympathy for people who can't be bothered wearing a fucking mask at this point.
21206,"Whether you believe in it or not, or you have your own baseless theories, thousands of people are dying, and as a courtesy to your fellow humans on the off chance it might help, wear a fucking mask."
21207,"If you can not abide by the basic rules in civilized society during a pandemic, and have basic human decency and respect for human lives, then yes the govt absolutely should step in, and you deserve to be punished."
21208,And sorry but I don't see how marginalized people are going to get fucked over even more.
21209,Marginalized people can wear their fucking mask.
21210,Masks are not a luxury item.
21211,If a policeman wants to create trumped up charges to fuck over marginalized people there are already plenty of laws they can use to fuck them over if they want.
21212,This is not a valid argument.
21213,"""I didn't listen to the warnings of my own family, and now **I'm** paying the price."""
21214,Asshole who infects his whole family is also self-centered.
21215,Who would've thought?
21216,I saw an article that said the pandemic is keeping people from going to get scanned and diagnosed and treated early enough for developing cancers.
21217,So cancer rates will go up as an indirect result.
21218,But as for this SARS variant actually causing cancer...
21219,"If it were a wart or cell abnormality causing virus like HPV then absolutely, but as far as I know, most respiratory viruses that cause long term issues mostly affect lung function and capacity."
21220,But this goes without saying: we don’t know everything about it yet.
21221,Just personal opinion - I would wager probably low likelihood the virus itself will directly cause cancer in the long term.
21222,You must not read too well.
21223,you're 100% right about needing to test and availability.
21224,"In other news, water is wet."
21225,This is about how many we need to do every single day for the rest of the year to hit the 20 million mark.
21226,"We definitely can do it, but bureaucracy might be the limiting factor."
21227,"You, trying to compare:

a.)"
21228,"a private act between two people that hopefully have enough respect for one another to discuss risks and consequences, to 
b.)"
21229,"Public distribution of microscopic water droplets dispersed by coughing and breathing and even talking loudly

Just shows how absolutely ignorant, uneducated, and stupid you are."
21230,Have you any idea how much food is thrown out by non-obese people that can afford it and don't care?
21231,Your points are trivial and obviously one sided responses derived from brainwashing propaganda.
21232,At this point I can't believe I'm wasting my time commenting to someone like you but I've taken the time to type this up so have at it.
21233,I wish you everything you deserve out of life.
21234,"Generally yes; but those things have been found to be dangerous over time, after many hundreds, thousands, or tens of thousands of ""doses""."
21235,"Vaccines go in your body, at most, once a year, and in very tiny amounts."
21236,"Even if they contained toxic ingredients, it wouldn't be a problem in the same way that smoking fifteen cigarettes a day for decades would, or a lifetime of a high salt high sugar diet."
21237,"A single dose of ranitidine per year won't give you cancer; but we just found out taking it regularly for your stomach issues, over a long period, could."
21238,"Many people happily and regularly consume things they KNOW are toxic over time, or potentially contaminated."
21239,Like.
21240,Cocaine?
21241,You have no idea what's in that.

21247,"Which, that's your risk to take, whatever, but at least do a cost benefit check."
21248,Woodstoves are a hazard; that's one I knowingly expose myself to.
21249,What exactly is it that people think is in vaccines that is poisonous to the extent that tiny doses every few years - or even just once as an infant and once a decade later... Will affect you?
21250,"There ARE things that can kill you in small doses, which we tend to call ""poison""."
21251,"And there are things that can build up over time, like heavy metals."
21252,That's maybe one of the answers - an older vaccine preservative called Thimerosal contains a type of mercury.
21253,"Everyone knows ""mercury is real bad for you"", and a single massive dose is fatal or debilitating as well as smaller doses being bioaccumulative and harmful over time."
21254,"Of course, that's *methyl mercury*, which your body can't process (or the even deadlier dimethyl mercury)... And Thimerosal contains *Ethyl mercury*, which your body can break down and dispose of."
21255,"This is the same reason you can drink ethanol, aka, drinking alcohol or ethyl alcohol, but methanol, aka chainsaw fuel, wood alcohol, or ethyl alcohol.. will fuck you up in a hurry if you have even a little."
21256,"They're only a few lousy carbons and hydrogens different, but your alcohol dehydrogenase enzymes make one into acetylaldehyde, which isn't an issue and just washes out of you, and the other into formaldehyde, which builds up into formic acid, which makes you go blind and damages your brain."
21257,You don't need to be a chemist or medical professional to understand the difference...
21258,But you kind of do need some basic chemistry and a&amp;p to understand it on the level where it actually makes sense as opposed to just reading it and taking it on faith that it's true.
21259,"I think a lot of people are skeptical because they lack the basics to understand the subject and so are ""thinking for themselves"" with incomplete information."
21260,"I get hearing ""mercury"" and thinking ""bad!!""."
21261,Not everyone had access to decent education in the sciences or the personal and family resources to engage with it fully.
21262,My understanding is the issue is the gurney.
21263,There no available bed/chair/ cot to move these patients to in order to free up the gurney.
21264,I wonder what will happen when hospitals have supply to immunize everyone but haven't finished when more vaccines come in.
21265,Would that state start their next phase?
21266,I feel like they should as long as the delay isn't a staffing shortage to administer it

21268,Diagnosed cancer is treated.
21269,But there are certainly cases where there have been delays in diagnosis.
21270,I had a friend have a long delay because he couldn't get timely appointments.

21283,"I know no one knows for sure, but it sounds like it might be similar to the flu"
21284,"Hey when you said I should learn about reality, what specifically did you mean?"
21285,Or did you just say that without actually knowing anything?
21286,"Just woke up, have ya?"
21287,It's been everywhere.

21302,I can’t imagine what the infection numbers will be like from the mega churches over Christmas
21303,Its been like that regarding everything in this pandemic and I am really starting to get tired of it.
21304,If you are opposed of a single thing you are all of a sudden anti-mask and just want to have no lockdown so you can get your hair done or something that all the people here moo about.
21305,There has been a blackout of any opposing opinion or any sort of discussion that doesnt involve lockdown for your entire life.
21306,I will now probably get angry comments on how can I be so irresponsible to suggest anything else than a lockdown for the next 48 years.
21307,The Oxford vaccine will be accepted shortly putting them up to a million a week.
21308,Of fucking course.
21309,"A man died in-flight and his wife informed the paramedic ""oh yeah he has covid""."
21310,I had to fly a couple of times since the pandemic started and honestly it was pretty scary how few precautions the airlines take.
21311,And even scarier how people just don't give a shit that they're putting others at risk.
21312,It’s a horrible and fatalistic way to look at it.
21313,"But, look at the cruise ships early on—we knew they had cases when they docked."
21314,We could tell them to stay where they were or get them proper treatment before disembarking.
21315,Wait isn't that why there are warm spots?
21316,This literally the first time I've heard about a 2nd shot of any kind.
21317,Do you mean in the UK?
21318,America will not achieve 85% vaccination by March.
21319,I’d be shocked if America ever sees that number unless it’s illegal to not get vaccinated (which isn’t going to happen).

21342,"Unless we somehow change what people my age are thinking, there's gonna be no end to this until we all vaccinate."
21343,You think they are just sitting around playing cards just not interested in giving out vaccines to eachother?
21344,You dont think it might have something to do with the fact that states like florida only got vaccines sent to 5 hospitals.
21345,That maybe those hospitals are also in the middle of a pandemic.
21346,"You think that when every CVS and walgreens in the country is getting thousands of vaccines shipped to them they will just sit and stare at them and say ""dang...it really sucks we cant give these out because we have to maintain that pace of those selfish nurses at those hospitals last month"""

21412,I think the American dream of working hard leading to amazing success is great and has helped millions.
21413,I know many people or my age group that started off in poverty and are doing very well financially due to hard work- but I think the flip side of one hospital visit for people operating on a thin margin can derail a family’s entire financial future.
21414,"Of course, work hard and you should be rewarded."
21415,I find a problem with working hard your entire life and an accident/disease and the financial costs can destroy your entire life’s financial future is too harsh.
21416,I’m lucky and my parents had decent health insurance and I have good health insurance.
21417,"It literally saves me tens of thousands of dollars... and I work hard to have a job that has good health insurance, but for example someone’s diabetes and the crippling insulin costs- that shouldn’t be the financial albatross it is in this country."
21418,If we want everyone to reach their full potential- basic healthcare needs to be a right.

21521,The COVID vaccine is proven to prevent symptoms in 90% of the cases.
21522,"Symptoms are what causes it to spread easily (coughing, etc.)."
21523,So getting a vaccine will reduce the risk of spread from that individual.
21524,"It is not yet proven to prevent spread, but considering that's unethical to test we'll have to see how it plays out."
21525,Most countries are just straight up not accepting Americans and people from other countries with high COVID cases.
21526,You may need a combination of COVID test + COVID vaccine to enter these countries - to prove you don't have it and to prove you can't spread it if you do get it.
21527,If it's found to prevent spread (as we ramp up WW vaccination rates) then you could remove the COVID test and just assume the COVID vaccine will prevent spread.
21528,"At least where I’m at in OC, people are starting to take it a little bit more seriously now."

21533,"China doesn’t have a free press, but they aren’t a closed off society anymore."
21534,If they had an uncontrolled covid outbreak the international press would know it.
21535,You can’t hide something with this type of impact for long.
21536,I would dispute the idea that it was using methods not available elsewhere.
21537,Other countries have imposed lockdowns.
21538,Other countries can test for covid.
21539,Other countries also have enforcement mechanisms for people who don’t obey the rules.
21540,And other countries can close their borders where necessary.
21541,"The thing that has been missing in a lot of other countries is the political will to implement these measures for a sustained period, regardless of the short term effects on the economy."
21542,"&gt;It's the same reason we don't calculate the 2,800,000 annual deaths in terms of 9/11, World Wars, or Vietnam."
21543,Because it's an utterly insane thing to do.
21544,But those are background deaths - deaths that are inevitable from year to year and are pretty much stable within a certain range.
21545,9/11 and the coronavirus pandemic are anomalies.
21546,"With other developed countries having &lt; 100 COVID deaths, it's obvious that a lot of the deaths in the US could have been prevented."
21547,"Sure, one can say that since we have a background of 2.8M already, what's another 300k?"
21548,"To which I would say, that's like an extra 10%."
21549,"People make a big deal about 10% when it concerns gains or losses in profit, savings, their net worth, etc., so why shouldn't they when it concerns human life?"

21555,How about the second?
21556,"First one was pretty light, the second kicked my ass."
21557,And in Norway the health care workers don't get prioritised for the vaccine.
21558,Priority number something something after healthy 45 year olds.
21559,Don't be dramatic and dumb.
21560,"You fine people, and if they don't learn the first time you fine them again an increased rate."
21561,If they don't have the money to pay they get to do community service and work off the fine hourly just like every other offense committed that demands payment if you can not pay.
21562,"Eventually just like every other crime if you refuse to comply, refuse restitution, and repeatedly violate the law, then yes, your ass lands in jail."
21563,I think just having lockdowns managed by the federal government (not the current administration ofc) would improve things a lot.
21564,You could actually shut down travel to and from states with outbreaks as well as implement measures to curb their outbreaks.
21565,That's pretty scary considering a lot of people on here saying they had some side effects just from the first...I hope they can figure out how to make it completely safe one day
21566,&gt;I saw another where some dude’s son literally carried him out of the store while he was screaming lol.

21617,South Africa gets it.

21629,They should make proof of vaccination required for voting.
21630,Get you a nicer voter ID with a vaccine check mark
21631,Usually masks don't stop you from breathing or communicating.
21632,And you could write laws in a way that it allows you to take off your masks while eating.
21633,Your argument is like saying driving a car should always be allowed even if you are under the influence because people need to commute.
21634,Holy shit that is authoritarian
21635,Everyone over 60 will have their first dose by the end of next week at the current pace.
21636,(about 1.4 million people).
21637,"BTW, where I like establishments enforce the mask rules."
21638,No mask  you are out.
21639,After all it doesn't make sense to wear a mask if you are walking alone on a empty road.
21640,Lol.
21641,Better start pumping out those shots
21642,It's the same shit over and over again.
21643,Getting tired of this BS.
21644,Let all the stupid people get covid.
21645,Yeah a person like you would speak the virus.
21646,Surprising how people from other countries are so against wearing masks.
21647,Masks are only going to help if both parties have one on and are wearing it correctly.
21648,"If just one person has it on and the other doesn't, then the aerosols will spread more rapidly."

21652,"It's a register for those who refused the vaccine, not those that haven't gotten it yet."
21653,Then why the support for AZ when the research is so sketchy?
21654,They have been working on a vaccine for as long as the other companies but it has taken longer and has not been proven yet.
21655,"Having had one Australian vaccine fail because of false positive HIV tests and now the problems with this one... Australia isn’t having much luck, especially when other countries are already distributing vaccines."
21656,I wondered about this going into the pharmacy yesterday.
21657,"They asked my symptom questions at the door and let me by when I answered in the desired way, but what if I hadn’t?"
21658,This particular pharmacy is within a large medical complex and shares entry with doctors offices.
21659,Aren’t people going in there sick?
21660,Have you watched TV?
21661,I don’t know what you watching but all my shows have done a Covid storyline and just about all the characters wear masks.
21662,They are doing way better than CA over the last few weeks even when you factor the population difference.
21663,And everything is wide open there.
21664,Newsom should resign considering how bad CA is doing now case wise lately and the economic damage is guidelines have done.
21665,Na.
21666,My argument is that we only care about money and not lives.
21667,"If there was an industry created around punishing people who don't wear masks, we'd create the laws to help that industry."
21668,"There is a difference though, 

These vaccines are developed and tested over many, many years and we have an extremely strong understanding of the side effects."
21669,COVID vaccines have been developed in record timing and with testing on very limited demographics.
21670,"On day two of the vaccinations in the UK, two people had near-fatal allergic reactions that were not picked up in trials."
21671,And we're going to legally force people to take this?

21677,I do know people who have been infected recently but none of them were seriously sick to the extent of needing hospitalisation.
21678,Reading the news reports you'd think SARS-COV2 had mutated to become airborne Ebola in the UK!
21679,"Human facial interaction is critical, being able to read the faces of people allows you to see their emotions."
21680,I know reddit hates people seeing them show emotion.
21681,Masks are not gonma become like pants no matter how bad this sub wants them too.
21682,Can't work.
21683,At this point you have spread even if you shut everything down besides the absolute essential.
21684,"And people can't eat money, lol."
21685,It's not a feasible solution.
21686,The issue has always been to keep the health system from collapsing.
21687,"So they should work towards reducing community spread, isolate high risk people and vaccinate them quickly."
21688,Eliminating total spread is not feasible especially at this point and especially in European countries.
21689,"It doesn't matter where you are from, but I assume you believe the situation in China is at least as bad as in the US, right?"

21735,This is actually the same argument that our (Sweden) state epidemiologist relies on.
21736,Weak data.
21737,"He's gotten a bit more backlash this wave though, and now you actually see maybe 1-5% of people wearing masks."
21738,In spring I saw maybe 5 masks in total.
21739,Reading this thread as a swede is crazy.
21740,"Globally enforced mask wearing, really?"
21741,You don't know what you're talking about.
21742,Just stop
21743,Germany seems to be going from one extreme to the other.
21744,Its fine to keep register of people thats literally how a government works.
21745,Might as well just dismantle record-keeping then.
21746,Wow.
21747,I'll be doing my own research but I'm really interested to see the official numbers on this too.
21748,I'm sure itll be very grim
21749,Have you got a better source than “some random guy on Twitter” or...
21750,"You see, this is what I mean."
21751,Drawing a false equivalence and a whataboutism aren't arguments.
21752,I criticize every government not doing enough to help curd the pandemic.
21753,"Yes in a lot of countries Covid deaths get under-report just like most governments, but **three times underreporting**?"
21754,No.
21755,"On the other hand though, here in Singapore, if others see you not wearing a mask, they will look at you as if you are a criminal and your face might get plastered all over the internet and you would get ridiculed online."
21756,"Anyways, most of Singaporeans are really compliant with the mask mandate."
21757,"So after all, a mask mandate not being enforced effectively is the same as not having a mask mandate"
21758,"Man man, uh, that understanding of fatality rates is not quite right"
21759,I haven’t deleted anything??
21760,BLM isn’t any of that..they just don’t actually care about black lives.
21761,And yea..It hypocritical to have all these rules that don’t apply just because “social injustice”.
21762,"It is entirely feasible, we just have to do what we did in the Spring, except this time keep going until the virus has gone (and make sure we don't let it back in)."
21763,"Of course, this means rich people may have to carry their share of the economic burden, so it won't happen."
21764,"As a critical writing tutor, I have to inform you that what you just said is inaccurate."
21765,There is no grammatical mandate to interpret that sentence as stating a person is guaranteed a ventilator if they do not get vaccinated.
21766,"For the same reason, the sentence also doesn’t imply that *everyone* experiences side effects from the vaccine, even though its wording is vague enough that you *could* interpret it that way if you do not have basic context on the conversation."
21767,"It’s very disingenuous that you would start this conversation with an irrelevant statistic about asymptomatic cases and continue to act as if you are well-informed on the topic of COVID, and yet you’re acting as if you didn’t understand what the poster you were responding to was saying (everyone else understood they were not talking about a guarantee of being on a ventilator)."
21768,"And you’re claiming you didn’t understand because you were forced to interpret the sentence a specific way based on grammatical structure.....a comment on Reddit....where most comments lack perfect or even consistent grammar, and yet people manage to communicate."
21769,Grammatical prescriptivism isn’t an excuse to not understand something with plenty of context.
21770,I have substantively addresses your points.
21771,Hundreds of thousands of people have died from COVID and many more have been sent to the hospital (or should have been).
21772,The disease is more than serious enough to take seriously and not doing so isn’t a personal decision.
21773,"It won’t just hurt you if you’re wrong, it will hurt those around you, too."
21774,That’s how disease works.
21775,That’s why your medical decision is my business.
21776,"This isn’t your colon acting up, it’s an infectious disease that has affected literally the entire world."
21777,And vaccines literally *require* most of the population to opt in for herd immunity to take effect.
21778,Your decision will affect others.
21779,It is not and cannot be private or ignored or overlooked.
21780,"Also, not knowing if the vaccine will 100% work is a bad reason not to take it."
21781,Just take it.
21782,"If it doesn’t work, no loss."
21783,But it will work because there are *many more* medical professionals from verified sources who have already extensively tested the two vaccines on the market for efficacy.
21784,"They will work and they will make you and yours, me and mine, and everyone else and theirs safer from this disease."
21785,"Please, just take it."
21786,Ah don’t worry about it.
21787,Here in the Netherlands we’re not starting until way into Januari anyway.
21788,Granted.

21795,The numbers here are way worse than NYCs in March and April.
21796,They also have their own testing and systems in place.
21797,I have a friend who is a DP and he gets between 6 and 9 tests a week.
21798,Boo fucking boo.
21799,"You are the company you keep, in this case quite literally—a strand of RNA hanging out in their bodies and injected into yours."
21800,Good.
21801,"If you were only harming yourself, that's fine, but by refusing to wear a mask, you could be actively harming other people."
21802,Not to mention that wearing a mask is quite literally one of the easiest things you can do.

21816,"There is no way for medical personnel, dentists or anyone that works at a dentists office, gas station personnel, pharmacies, car repair shops, etc."
21817,to shut down.
21818,So it still wouldn't be fair.
21819,Back in March literally everything was shut down to an extreme.
21820,And nobody was paid to stay home.
21821,Not fair to the people that lost jobs or businesses.
21822,"But from a virus prevention stand point, it was effective."
21823,"The difference now is that there is a lot more travel, and gatherings, that really can't easily be enforced."
21824,"Well, considering if you’re in the US, it’s mostly high risk individuals who are able to get it right now anyways, you don’t have much of a choice."
21825,"Otherwise, that’s fucked up dude."

21838,A whole bunch of residents of a local nursing home have tested positive in the two weeks since they got the vaccine.
21839,Not a shock.
21840,"Once it gets into a ltc home, it spreads quickly."
21841,They had not had the vaccine long enough in the past to expect anything different.
21842,Lol
21843,The phases are super complicated.
21844,1a are getting it now.
21845,1b is early to mid January according to the video last week.

21865,"It's the free market, charge or don't charge to use your property, nobody is obligated to let poor people house there."
21866,There was a significant decrease in the amount of tests done while the number of positives have remained relatively the same.

21892,They told me 10 days without symptoms and I can return.
21893,The complication is my roommate’s new fever and headache.
21894,Requiring a negative test is pretty crazy because individuals who are no longer contagious can still test positive for a few months after getting over the virus.
21895,How the hell am I being naïve?
21896,You can just get an online job from home and buy groceries/other things online.
21897,You can very well stay at home if you actually can't wear a mask.

21912,I think what I’ve seen is that it likely reduces spread but there’s no scientific evidence for it (it would’ve been impossible to test for)
21913,"I've had multiple teachers, professors, managers and supervisors, and my own mother tell me the ""rule of thumb is; if you can get out of bed, you can go to school/university/work."""

21915,"They don't mean if you feel sick stay in bed, they literally mean unless you are at the hospital in a bed with a doctor telling you you'll die if you leave, you best come in...


Any job I've had since graduation have only allowed one call in every 6 months, any after that you'll get written up, and 2 write ups means your terminated - and doctors notes do not affect that, unless you're in the hospital."
21916,"It's already been stated (unofficially though) in my district alone that children were sent to school because their parents didn't have childcare, or because the day care wouldn't take them sick, or in one instance a parent thought it was fine because although her children were positive, they weren't showing any symptoms."
21917,People are ignorant.
21918,This will only continue to get worse.
21919,I'm sure a lot more stories would come out.
21920,"Oh, and I've had an (email) conversation with my superintendent (after they announced in person school will be opening in my district after winter break -which I'm in Michigan so cases are just now finally plateauing ."

21922,I told him to just look at the timeline.
21923,"He said he needed specific studies to show ""the board"" because the damn cdc and who says that schools are necessary for mental health and obesity...


Our school had to shut down for a week lady year because of the flu, for 3 days in the spring of 2019 because of the norovirus, and a few times throughout the year because of mono."
21924,But now they want to just deny reality that kids go to school sick and it's a cesspool.
21925,Definitely when they're not social distancing at all either.
21926,When they closed in November before Thanksgiving my county's percent positive was almost 25%.
21927,I just can't even...
21928,If you've made it this far - sorry for the rant.
21929,"It's just infuriating, and besides my household, my entire family is making it seem like I'm the crazy one for not celebrating ""with the family"" and keeping my kids home and getting frustrated with how this is all being handled."

22060,The US doesn't do shit to protect itself or the rest of the world and just boards people.
22061,Covid does not appear to mutate as quickly as the flu.
22062,"And since a person is infectious for a short period of time (days or weeks) if that infected person does not come in contact with another unvaccinated person, the virus has nowhere to go."
22063,"While we don't know for sure what the % is, it will likely be closer to 70% as people who have been infected and recovered are likely immune too."

22183,Yes.
22184,You shouldn't be allowed to until you get a basic vaccine.
22185,There's people who can't get vaccines even if they want to.
22186,Should they be limited because of you?

22194,I would be truly protected until 5 ish days after the second round.

22375,Doctors who refuse to prescribe opioids are driving more patients to buy what they need off the streets.
22376,What can you buy on the streets?
22377,That would be fentanyl and other really dangerous drugs.
22378,My doctor refuses to prescribe Norco.
22379,I use approximately 30 pills a year.
22380,He thinks that's an addiction so now I have nothing to treat any acute pain.
22381,I've been tempted to buy from the street too but I'm far too chicken.
22382,Isn’t that the same logic as people at risk should just stay at home and masks should be optional?
22383,"The airline i took enforced it, but still handed out beverages to people even on a 30 minute flight."

22441,I'd also make the distinction that we're ALL forbidden from doing a bunch of stuff this year.

The mean time from infection to symptom onset is 6 days."
22496,"Very few, if any, end up in the hospital in 3 days after first encountering the virus."
22497,He got it before that and brought it to the party.
22498,Of course since this was a White House party I’m sure he was just 1 of about 10 others that arrived infected.

22507,Since we don’t have students in buildings I do a lot of contact tracing for employees who tested positive.
22508,A couple weeks ago I had to contact a secretary from one of the schools in our district that had tested positive.
22509,"She had started not feeling well on the previous Wednesday, then went to work Thursday and Friday."
22510,Over the weekend her daughter(who she had been around) got results that she had tested positive.
22511,This lady went to work AGAIN on Monday.
22512,When I got the case information on Wednesday I found out she had exposed several people in the building she works at.
22513,One of the people she exposed was a janitor.
22514,"He was supposed to be off that week, but she had made him a pie so he went to the building to get it from her and then she had him come to her office to fix a clock."
22515,While I’m talking to this lady I was just amazed at how irresponsible and reckless she was.
22516,"The most irritating part is that she was fully capable of working from home, and our district has allotted 80 hours of covid leave time so you don’t have to use your sick hours."
22517,"There was absolutely no reason for her to be in the building and putting everyone else at risk, and there’s really no telling what kind of other places she went out to while she was infectious."

22738,"Asymptomatic cases, i.e."

22803,&gt; The timing of priming and booster vaccine administration varied between studies.
22804,"As protocol amendments to add a booster dose took place when the trials were underway, and owing to the time taken to manufacture and release a new batch of vaccine, doses could not be administered at a 4-week interval."
22805,"1459 (53·2%) of 2741 participants in COV002 in the LD/SD group received a second dose at least 12 weeks after the first (median 84 days, IQR 77—91) and only 22 (0·8%) received a second dose within 8 weeks of the first."
22806,The median interval between doses for the SD/SD group in COV002 was 69 days (50–86).
22807,"Conversely, the majority of participants in COV003 in the SD/SD group (2493 [61·0%] of 4088) received a second dose within 6 weeks of the first (median 36 days, 32–58; appendix 1 p 11)."

23026,I bet I’ve had at least a dozen flu shots and the worst side effect I ever get is a sore arm (and not always that).
23027,I wonder what makes the difference?
23028,I have twice had old people try to push into small lifts with me and then get offended when I stood my ground.
23029,It only disproportionally affects marginalized people of there is a barrier in place.
23030,Free vaccines and masks simply would create a marginalized group of selfish twats.
23031,I'm all for identifying those sorts of people so that I know ahead of time who I don't want to interact with.

23088,"You can be fined up to £10,000 for not doing so."
23089,"But the police can't challenge you and there is strictly no burden of proof because we don't want to be mean to people with hidden disabilities."""
23090,"Or:

Gov't: Let's do a travel ban!"
23091,There is now a travel ban in force!
23092,Police: We will not be enforcing the travel ban or challenging anyone.
23093,And killing hundreds of thousands over burgers and beer is not?
23094,"Less than:
1) The number of domestic violence victims injured by drunk partners."
23095,2) The number of road accident victims from drunken driving.
23096,3) The number of self injuries from drunken accidents.

23100,We did it at the start of Coronavirus for a few months and we made it through that.
23101,We have to do it again because people have zero self control.
23102,You're talking about doing that in the middle of a global pandemic when governments' resources really should be focused elsewise.
23103,Outside of covid they seem to have a very low morality rate so that do seem to be doing alright most of the time.

23127,"I've been saying that from the start, because they hide their numbers when anything bad happens."
23128,They've been doing that for many years.

23132,"Using current logic (in the uk at least) if you had a positive Covid test, recovered and 27 days later had a heart attack and died you'd be a Covid death."
23133,So why arent you a Covid vaccine death if you have a heart attack 2 hours after?
23134,They just need more funding to look out for the next bigger one /s
23135,From the article...
23136,"Without the test kits, contact tracing was stymied; without contact tracing, there was no obstacle in the contagion’s path."
23137,"America never once had enough reliable tests distributed across the nation, with results available within two days."
23138,"By contrast, South Korea, thanks to universal public insurance and lessons learned from a 2015 outbreak of mers, provided free, rapid testing and invested heavily in contact tracing, which was instrumental in shutting down chains of infection."
23139,The country has recorded some fifty thousand cases of covid.
23140,The U.S. now reports more than four times that number per day.
23141,"This pandemic has made me realize how much I underappreciated live music, shows, comedy, stage theater, and street performers/buskers."

23203,Thank you so much for this comment!!!
23204,Al the people saying that have NEVER been to ASIA and are just talking to be heard.
23205,"If you actually go to Asia, like I have pre-covid you do see people wearing masks but it’s less than 1 percent of the whole population."
23206,There are 2 main reasons why people did this and it dosent really involve flu or sickness like people have wrote on here.
23207,"The first reason is due to the radiation, places like Japan, have high radiation in the air due to chemical spills."
23208,"The second reason is for privacy in public, people don’t want to be seen."
23209,"I am absolutely sick and tired of people saying “what the big deal with mask, the Japanese, have been doing it for years”, not true."
23210,There was never no universal wear masks to prevent others from getting sick.
23211,"Undercounting won't change it into something killing hospital staff and college students en masse, or having SARS 2003's fatality rate in the elderly."
23212,A majority died *with* medical care.
23213,"Delta is way better though, they keep the middle seat open which is already a huge plus."
23214,Dr. Fauci said 90% would get us herd immunity.
23215,At least this sub description mentioned the virus emerged from Wuhan.
23216,Damn another window with loose hinge.
23217,Having a few friends in China from the beginning I would say obviously higher than they are saying but basically they slowed and then stopped this thing pretty early.
23218,My friends say life is back to normal and government pounces on any new cases with millions of tests and the people are pretty compliant because (China) but also because no one wants to be locked down again and be like the rest of the world with Covid running rampant.
23219,"So yeah, fake initial numbers but they really have tackled community spread both from top down but also from the bottom up."
23220,"I'm ""afraid"" that dicks like you will spread the disease faster and faster."

23223,"I live in a very populous area with a covid half the rate of the bfe town I'm from has, which basically has zero population."

23226,I wonder which camp you're in.
23227,I have friends that have COVID-19 and some that have died from it.
23228,"It’s awful and, in every case, was totally avoidable."
23229,Maybe we should ask them and their families how silly it is because they likely wouldn’t have caught the virus if the people around them had just worn a fucking mask like they were supposed to.
23230,"Look I understand that it’s very easy to take your “it’s not a big deal” stance when you haven’t seen, firsthand, the effects of this virus on the lives of the people you love."
23231,But these comments are rude and very disrespectful to the people who have been suffering and dying.
23232,"We simply have to do better, collectively, at looking out for our fellow humans."
23233,I have to wear a mask all day at work and it fucking sucks man.
23234,I *hate* it and the best part of my day is when I get done and finally get to take it off.
23235,But I’m not complaining because it’s what we need to do to slow this thing down until we can get a vaccine fully deployed.
23236,Shit is bananas in the hospitals right now and it takes very little effort to do my part.
23237,I just wish antimaskers would change their perspective and trust the experts when they say “cover your nose and mouth with a mask” and “don’t travel.” But instead people are constantly looking for loopholes and complaining about their rights when it’s not about them.
23238,It’s about everyone around them.
23239,That type of behavior is selfish and disgusting.
23240,Sorry for writing a novel but this is a topic that’s very close to me.
23241,Also pandemics scare the shit out of me more than anything else (even more than sharks.)

23273,"“We only have ourselves to blame”

Just what the people who fucked this up want us to be saying."
23274,60% isn’t the threshold.
23275,"I work in tech, management, and I'm involved with many aspects of the business including recruiting."
23276,I find on Reddit that a lot of people assume money is the only say in a person's or company's decision making.
23277,"State X has lower taxes, so companies will go there."
23278,It's cheaper in Y so people will flock there if paid well.
23279,"That's simply not true though for young people, and companies while they may enjoy lower taxes they may need young people so lower taxes means nothing if you can't find qualified candidates to work for you."
23280,I can't speak for medicine specifically but I imagine that rural hospitals and doctor's offices recruit heavily from young doctors because young people are the most likely to move and shake things up.
23281,The thing is young people really don't care about money as much as the older generation does.
23282,"I mean they care about money, don't get me wrong, but it's not the driving force in their decision making."
23283,I work with a lot of very well paid even for an expensive area young people and they all drive modest used cars and live modest lifestyles when it comes to stuff.
23284,"They do seem to spend their money on doing things, especially travel."
23285,Young people are more about experiences and less about nice cars and big suburban homes.
23286,Our employees would rather live in a small place in an expensive city than rural America.
23287,"If we up and moved our company to a small town, gave everyone a raise and talked about the low cost of living in their new hometown we'd lose damn near every employee we have."
23288,"Our entire business would disappear in months if we moved to a cheap, rural area."
23289,"Obviously medicine can't choose where to place hospitals, they need to be everywhere but that's why rural hospitals struggle even with high pay and a low cost of living."
23290,Young people just aren't homebodies and they just don't care about wealth accumulation that much.
23291,You still have to get 2 doses of the Moderna and Pfizer ones.
23292,3 months apart is logistically easier than the 3-4 weeks apart timestable for the others.
23293,If gives you more time to produce and distribute the vaccine to various locations.
23294,"Idiots try to help other idiots understand that gatherings, big or small, are a bad idea."
23295,Idiots fail to understand until it affects them personally.
23296,"So many articles like this, but the readers they’re trying to reach won’t get it anyway and the rest of us who do already get it, don’t need to be told again."
23297,Time.
23298,We have to wait for people with brain rot to die and improve education for future generations.
23299,"That's an awful lot of words for ""ayup!!"
23300,"ahyuk ahyuk!"""
23301,Some are worse than others.
23302,"I got the shingles vaccine and they flew week ago, and I had chills, fatigue, muscle ache, etc, for a couple of days."
23303,"There old one apparently wasn't as bad, but also wasn't as effective."
23304,"The new one is much more effective, but something like 75% of people gets laid out with flu symptoms."
23305,*Sometimes*.
23306,LOL
23307,Good to hear!
23308,I’m so jealous.
23309,The incompetence here in Florida is astounding.
23310,We have our elderly camping out in lines outside overnight like this is a fucking Black Friday deal at Best Buy.
23311,Teachers and front line retail workers have no priority.
23312,My sister is in health care and got hers today at a top tier medical facility and said it was a chaotic mess.
23313,Not a day goes by that I don’t feel awful that I moved my family to this incompetent state.
23314,If that’s what it takes to make self absorbed people respect the greater good then so be it.
23315,Yep this is me.
23316,I told my friend.
23317,Americas response to the Covid-19 virus was to shut down all public restrooms.
23318,I have shit outside in the bushes 2X this month.
23319,I carry a small spade and disposable wet wipes in my car.
23320,This.
23321,Is.
23322,Capitalism.
23323,This is the price of an economic system based upon consumption to power jobs.
23324,Once you break the market's cyclical consumption pattern - literally everything falls apart.
23325,"https://mobile.twitter.com/ZeitgeistFilm/status/1333213806013468672

I highly recommend reading The New Human Rights Movement: Reinventing  the Economy to End Oppression by Peter Joseph which goes in depth on the history, unsustainability and how insane the current economic models really are."
23326,Interview from 3 years ago about the book but on point with current socioeconomic problems.
23327,"Especially climate change, technological unemployment and poverty."
23328,https://youtu.be/V7SsbOEO6fA
23329,Then you are looking at it wrong.
23330,"Wuhan went into lockdown January 23rd it wasn't until march 5th that the numbers started to stop, although they still went up a little."
23331,"Guess what if nobody leaves their house for 6 weeks the numbers will surprisingly go down by quite a huge amount, what would you expect."
23332,"I'm talking a real proper lockdown, not the half arsed measures you may have went through, the streets were absolutely deserted."
23333,"You can be as suspicious as you like, it doesn't change the fact that for 9 months China has been going about it's business virtually virus free."
23334,Once you stamp it out as hard as they did originally and then have solid border controls it isn't actually that hard to contain it.
23335,Instead of being suspicious of China you should be asking why your country didn't do more.
23336,Smart move But what took so long.
23337,?
23338,&gt; -26 but not a single person dares to actually answer??
23339,You're referring to a question.
23340,Directly above someone's comment was deleted.
23341,I know deduction isn't a 45ist's strong suit but even you should be able to get this.
23342,"Which rules ""don't apply because social justice""?"
23343,There haven't been any covid cases traced to those protests.
23344,And yet dozens of new cases get recorded regularly from maskless events held by your gods.
23345,I wonder why that is?
23346,Such a huge mystery...must be a conspiracy against repuglicans.
23347,You people should come out with what you really think: black people have more power than you're comfortable with already.
23348,People have become a ticking time bomb because they either don't know or don't care that they have the coronavirus and are determined to go about their life as if there is no pandemic.👎💔
23349,Extreme case?
23350,Want it the government that set the goalpost at 20 million by year end?
23351,It hurts the store.
23352,If it's a small store you basically steal from the owner.

23357,"Norway, death rate per million 79, Sweden 800+."
23358,Amazing.
23359,Exactly.
23360,The only question is how many multiples of ten is it off by?
23361,Define reliable.
23362,We have estimations that are probably close-ish.
23363,But are they like “proven”?
23364,No.
23365,And then there’s the weird thing of proving an actual asymptomatic case.
23366,"If I woke up this morning a bit stuffy, I wouldn’t remember in a week."
23367,"Technically, I’m not asymptomatic, but if I had Covid at this time, I’d report no symptoms later because, well, little things like this don’t stick with me."
23368,I’m occasionally stuffy.
23369,I occasionally sneeze.
23370,I occasionally cough.
23371,"we also call black people N----S just for the giggle, it's nothing racists."
23372,"Because I care about you like  alot, but don't."
23373,"If you are aged and vulnerable, you don’t have to die."
23374,"You can stay at home and only mix with other individuals in the same boat with no external physical contact with the rest of society, outside of picking up your groceries at the end of your driveway or on your doorstep."
23375,And the mortality stats between 60-70 aren’t exactly worrisome.
23376,A 4.4% seropositivity for Wuhan is pretty decent considering this was *ground zero* for a novel and completely unknown virus.
23377,That's not what I asked.
23378,And maybe threaten to not give care to people who do not comply with wearing masks.
23379,You need to hold people accountable if you want them to change.
23380,No mask.
23381,No admission to ER.
23382,"wait, how come you got two kind of vaccine?"
23383,"They're not just low, they're completely fabricated."
23384,Look how this pandemic has effected every country on Earth.
23385,"Then consider the fact Wuhan was completely unprepared and was caught off guard, because they had it first."
23386,Extrapolate from that what Wuhan's real numbers are...
23387,It's amazing that the medical community literally just discovered in 2020 how awesome masks are.
23388,What the hell were they doing for the past 5000 years?
23389,How many poor people could have been saved from TB just in the past decade?
23390,10s of millions?
23391,Why are there no charities collecting masks and sending them to Africa like malaria nets?
23392,Naw he booked his place in hell when he participated in the pool.
23393,Now he's trying to upgrade his ticket to business class with those comments.
23394,Is anyone actually enforcing the bubbles or is it just the trust system?
23395,Yeah I don’t think that’s accurate lol
23396,...the owners of the food.

23411,"My grandmother and my brother in laws aunt both died with coronavirus in their system (without likely having died from the virus itself, though a potential player)."
23412,Neither of their death certificates even mentioned coronavirus.
23413,Both lived on completely opposite sides of the country which makes me a bit skeptical that they are actually mislabeling deaths as rampantly as (some) people think.
23414,"Though my sample size is small, I feel it holds a little more weight than your outlandish claim that HALF of deaths are mislabeled, fraud is still a very big and real offense.... unless your affiliated with Trump 🙂😀😆😂😭"
23415,Agreed but airing it out online seems desperate and isn't healthy.
23416,FYI
23417,The logistics are a sovled problem.
23418,There are 200 million flu vaccines administered mostly through clinics and drug stores like CVS and Walgreens.
23419,The plan has always been to partner with them.
23420,"Distribution 'seems' to be going okay, at least going by the CDC tracker."
23421,11 million were distributed as of yesterday.
23422,The problem really is states not updating.
23423,Look at [Bloomberg's tracker](https://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/covid-vaccine-tracker-global-distribution/) and notice there's a fair amount of states that don't have a timely update
23424,80% doesn’t matter.
23425,Once we vaccinate the elderly - around 30 million - death rates will plummet by 80% and lockdowns will be removed.
23426,"They seem pretty confident it’s going to get approved, so I don’t think that’s the reason."
23427,I hope you’re right though.
23428,1) no.
23429,It would be a tremendous undertaking.
23430,"2) even if it was easy, there's a hundred separate steps between farm and table."
23431,Anyone living in even a reasonably densely populated zone would have difficulty finding food if the supply chain was broken.
23432,We're dependent on workers.
23433,"They aren't really wearing them...once again the ignorance and xenophobia of other cultures by these so- called ""progressives"" shows."
23434,1.
23435,You walk on the street during flu season and you see 1% of people in Japan wearing masks...because they are actually sick with symptoms but don't want to miss work or school by just staying home for a few days.
23436,2.
23437,"In China, people who live in densely populated and highly polluted cities sometimes wear masks outdoors...because of the amount of pollution."
23438,"This whole fetishizing of ""muh Asians love masks"" is disgusting."
23439,Too bad many of them have already reproduced.
23440,"Yes, T-shirts with the text ""Knocking On Heavens Door""."
23441,Sad but true.
23442,I agree with you
23443,"The type of dudes that you are responding to are almost fetishizing the mask, someone even said that you should get punched for not wearing a mask."
23444,I think this is it for us guys.
23445,We have now officially entered a boring dystopia.
23446,Lol well obviously.
23447,But I’ve had the rabies vaccine which is said to cause a lot of side effects and I was fine so I’m just trying to gauge exactly what happened.

23456,"When you live in rural areas, wifi is really hard to get that isn’t really expensive, bad, usually  satellite internet with a data cap."
23457,"When I lived in the sticks in Michigan at the start of this, before I graduated, we had 60 gigs of satellite internet a month for like $150."
23458,"After the 60 gigs, it would slow down considerably."
23459,"Even when we still did have “high speed,” it wasn’t topping out anywhere near enough to do zoom calls."
23460,"That was the best our family, and many others’, could get."
23461,"They have to say ""don't come to work if you are sick""."
23462,"What they mean is ""don't tell anyone you are sick, do your job""."
23463,"I remember a few months after covid became a ""big thing"" I was around someone who was potential exposed, but also there were no tests available for the average person yet."
23464,I thought it was the right thing to let my employer know that there was a chance I could have came in contact with it.
23465,I wasn't allowed to go back into work for over a month.
23466,They wanted a negative test but at the time there was no where for me to get one.
23467,When I got back to work I was told to just not say anything next time.
23468,A doozy
23469,"I mean, 7% of people going around without a mask is still really goddamn dangerous."

23481,"I agree, but the country has some deep rooted problems and excessive drinking is more a symptom of that than anything else."
23482,Lack of funding in public healthcare means that government hospitals are in a bad place usually so anything can tip them over the edge.
23483,Also there is the added layer of organised crime gangs who are happy to supply alcohol “illegally”.
23484,Same happened when they banned cigarettes previously.
23485,The alcohol and cigarettes the gangs supply is usually poor quality knockoffs which can also be dangerous.

23493,You can find what they've released so far [here](https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(20)32661-1/fulltext).
23494,"It's perplexing though, because this publication doesn't show a real difference based upon the interval between doses."
23495,Perhaps they have additional data or something now.
23496,Or they could just be breaking this data down into further subgroups.
23497,Couldn't have said it better myself
23498,"I volunteered at one recently in San Jose, CA."
23499,"They usually open 8am to 4pm, but hours are variable depending on how many volunteers and workers they have (food banks aren't exactly the most adequately staffed places right now)."
23500,"The one I volunteered all had it set up for drive-by - you are checked in and if it's your first time there, registered; you pull your car in; the workers open your trunk; and they drop off pre-determined boxes of random foodstuffs."
23501,"Things to note:

1."
23502,"Due to high demand for food bank services right now (anywhere from 200%-1000% from pre-pandemic demand), it is best to come early and know that you may be waiting up to an hour or two for service."
23503,2.
23504,Don't be a choosing beggar.
23505,"The workers are trying to get food to people as fast as possible so don't nitpick about what you get, even if you are potentially allergic to what they're offering."
23506,"If you have a food allergy, you can let the loaders know, but don't hold it against them if they don't have the time to rummage through your package to remove the offending items."
23507,3.
23508,"If you come towards the end (like near 3pm or even 2pm in some locations), you may be turned away."
23509,It is best to call ahead to see what their hours of distribution are.
23510,Sometimes this might even be variable from week to week as the pandemic has affected the availability of services and staff.

23522,Case numbers (at least in my area) are growing uncontrollably with no end in sight.
23523,And apparently we’ll need a very high vaccinated rate to even stop the virus in a significant way.
23524,"Plus, officials seem very interested in shifting goalposts so even IF we manage to drop hospitalizations and deaths, I’m worried they’ll find a new set of criteria to use to guide reopening."
23525,"They wear cloth masks, not single use."
23526,In Sweden only about 5% of people wear masks.
23527,"So now then, what is your opinion of 95% of Swedes?"
23528,https://covid19.healthdata.org/sweden?view=mask-use&amp;tab=trend
23529,Just need to find whoever the fuck asked and let them know
23530,eh don't boil it down to them.
23531,I flew delta and on both of my flights they offered individualized water bottles and I was like no... thanks... i wasn't gonna take my mask off for any reason :(
23532,This might be related to the high number of tests we've been doing.
23533,The last few days we've gotten up to 100k tests a day
23534,No.
23535,No you’re not
23536,Individualism and risk-taking have always gone hand-in-hand.
23537,"In the American west, it was the women and children, and the educated people from the East, who finally tamed the small towns, and then they grew."
23538,"Where the educated and the strong have to leave for better opportunity, you find dying small towns gutted of logic but steeped in “rugged Americanism”."
23539,The original reason europeans came to America was to have opportunity and freedom from class and societal constraints.
23540,People who live in villages and participate in thrice weekly social activities will support each other.
23541,Rural people who only come to town every 2 weeks will not have the attachment bonds.
23542,"Those rural people will not recognize their anti-social belief system is hurting others, until their own family is affected."
23543,That is why mask-wearing has now taken a jump in rural stares.
23544,"Not after Sturgis rally the epidemic got going in the Dakotahs, now more people wear masks in town."
23545,Should've been since the benninging
23546,Mouth breather
23547,I think it’s awesome teachers are actually high up on the list too!
23548,I more or less went this way.
23549,Just in case the Spanish Flu came back.
23550,"If they can do it, so can other states."
23551,Excuses for  other states being behind?
23552,They're demonizing because they've been demonized for a long time and they're fighting back.
23553,Is it right?

23566,But I guess this means USA.
23567,why do you think it will last all of 2021?
23568,"Yeah, I know."
23569,I'll just have to get used to it I guess.
23570,Do homeless change masks every 4 hours they are supposed to?
23571,"Those masks are single use, not to be used for weeks."
23572,In my state nobody has worn masks for over 6 months since we haven't had any cases.
23573,But I'd wear one without hesitation of it sparked up here.
23574,I think it is still dependent upon some factors but masks aren’t going away for a while 😩
23575,can someone through the paywall copy and paste please
23576,I’m not so sure about that... People that believe in science don’t need “encouragement”.
23577,People that don’t believe in science will never be “encouraged”.
23578,I’m also not sure the politicians sent the best message jumping the line in front of frontline workers and high riskers.
23579,The politicians have the best healthcare in the world.
23580,Ahh okay.
23581,Thanks for the clarification.
23582,I agree with that sentiment.
23583,But how do we handle ignorance?
23584,I think punishment would only foster more deliberate ignorance
23585,"And in the post covid world, these unnecessary people will have to renegotiate their role in society."
23586,I've been hearing that due to the logistical issues that goal was pushed back to the first week in January.
23587,If the trend of vaccines ramping up by a factor of 3 continues (idk if it will) we did .5m 1.5m hopefully 4.5m this week and then hopefully (if we're extremely lucky) closer to 10m next week which would put us closer
23588,Thank you for sharing!
23589,I light at the end of the tunnel!!
23590,"I agree, I'm looking forward to more positive covid milestones."
23591,"I live in Ontario, and I can assure you people don’t care about the lockdown."
23592,The only difference between lockdown and no lockdown is that people have dinner at people’s houses instead of a restaurant.
23593,"Sadly, I realized yesterday that we are better off vaccinating the “masks violate my personal liberties!” crowd first, they are the super spreaders."
23594,Yes this gets lost but the health risk is literally thousands of times higher for those 65+ with pre-existing conditions.
23595,"That is a relatively small population, about 10-15%."
23596,"If they are vaccinated and the fatality rate is something like 0.01% for the rest of the population, the pandemic is not over but it's a completely different scenario."
23597,"I think once we vaccinate the most at-risk 30-50 million people, it will change everything."
23598,"And then China pulled a 180, CCP bots were posting those fake ""collapsing in the street"" videos to scare everyone."
23599,"Twitter removed ,170k Chinese bots in March but the damage was done."
23600,And it’s one mistake that literally everyone made.
23601,It wasn’t even a dumb mistake
23602,I'm pro-mask but forcing people to wear them is NOT the way to do it.
23603,"Individual countries could ignore the EMA, there is nothing binding, other than political pressure like the extensive criticism from EU of UK about approval."
23604,UK did nothing special other than talk to companies about making our processes fit better.
23605,"So we accepted research submitted to other agencies with minor tweaks to be compliant, cutting bureaucracy allowing the final submission to be quicker."
23606,True the EMA are being so slow.
23607,Mostly as they are not granting emergency approval so it takes a lot longer and companies have to prove that the short trial is as effective as the long one.
23608,"Also they moved out of London, have put new people in charge in November and were slow to react to the pressure from EU governments - although they are moving a lot quicker than planned."
23609,"It is probably a lot easier to go through 1 EMA than 27 countries, with 27 different payments and prices."
23610,"Also they know stock will be purchased so why bother going through the pain initially, when you can get into other markets?"
23611,But it can't work like that.
23612,"If the patient would have yellow fever, no problemo, even though he never got a vaccine against it because he never traveled, but he has covid, so no, no help for him?"
23613,really?
23614,The problem is the EU always needs so much time for the review
23615,"The goal was 20m doses so even if the high end from /u/Actuary_420 of 8m was doubled, they'd still miss ""goal""."
23616,"Heck, they could get to 19.5m doses and still ""miss""."
23617,Doesn't mean everything is sunshine and roses though.
23618,This is a scale problem.
23619,"To get 70% of the population having the vaccine administered, that's roughly 460m doses in the US (230m people, 2 doses each)."
23620,"At 2m a day, that's roughly mid-August."
23621,I'm treating this like a cargo ship situation.
23622,"The amount to be delivered is huge, the infrastructure to do the delivery is capable of handling it, but it will take a bit to get up to full speed."
23623,"Once it does, things will start to get better."
23624,"Be patient, wear your mask, wash your hands, be socially distant where possible, assume we have to keep it up through 2021."
23625,"Look at it this way... if you keep some of these habits up going forward, you'll be at a lower risk for getting seasonal colds or flu infections so it's not a half bad idea anyway."
23626,is the US lying about it's death total also?
23627,what about england?
23628,italy?
23629,iran?
23630,i haven't seen any news reports from countries that are telling the truth
23631,"90% was never the threshold for approval, and the MHRA will probably approve it this week according to reports."
23632,The actual UK regulator is probably more reliable than a Wired article.
23633,Countries like Tanzania are hiding cases.
23634,"Masks are only going to help with some pandemics, not all of them."
23635,Some will be more of the handwashing surface/skin infection kind of pandemics as they've been popular throughout the ages too.
23636,But yeah.. a couple boxes of masks can be made to last a long time for occasionally going out during a pandemic.
23637,"I have 3m Coolflows around my house, BUT what helped the most was not living in a science denial state."
23638,"When I was in college, the state would absolve a huge portion of your student loans if you were an education major and you worked in an “at need” area for 2 years immediately following graduation."
23639,"A dent was made in the problem for 2 years, then word got out how awful it was to live and work in these areas (not because of the students) and the problem got worse for the years after that."
23640,People that wanted to be teachers but knew they would have loans they couldn’t afford to pay back just didn’t become teachers anymore.
23641,Neat.
23642,Scrubs here are like wearing pajamas.
23643,Looks like the UK has scrubs that are more like bathrobes.
23644,Why should we assume this?
23645,Assuming the people who stayed in for Thanksgiving stayed in for Christmas and vice versa (those who went out went out again)....I don’t see why we should believe there will be a significant rise in cases especially with the shutdown-lite going on.
23646,"It appears this most recent spike is ending as the worst, most populous states who were responsible for the bulk of this wave are flattening or declining case wise."
23647,Combine this with vaccine rollouts and I feel pretty comfortable making an assumption that this wave will be over by early Feb if we don’t see a major spike in 2 weeks.
23648,i'd actually rather see all the catch up on one day (which won't happen) since a day of 10k/500k with every other day normal would be better than a bunch of days where we have no clue if a small bump is real or lag
23649,Doubt it'll be that long.
23650,Many countries like India and Kenya are starting in January so I don't see why the EU won't be similar.
23651,There is millions of doses just sitting there ready to be used
23652,80% of the fatalities are in 15% of the population.
23653,Once that population is mostly vaccinated and the fatality rate falls by 80% it will be a completely different ballgame.
23654,"We have had 20 million cases in the US but most likely far more than that have been exposed/infected, some say 2 times, some say 5 times."
23655,Unfortunately we don't know who these people are.
23656,Ideally we'd give antibody tests before giving the vaccine.
23657,But the at-risk population is about 50 million people and they can be vaccinated within 2 months.
23658,"Same, same."
23659,I hope it becomes far more normalised in congested areas.
23660,"I'm not British, but I think it is yes."
23661,"If they had spent most of the year passing laws like this rather than justifying not having them, they would have been ready to enforce these sorts of restrictions at the first sign of the second wave and quite possibly would have avoided having 40,000 new cases per week."
23662,"The Swedish government is embodying the old idiom of ""shutting the barn door after the horse has bolted""."
23663,They are now floundering around trying to figure out what to do after the benefit of doing it is all but gone.
23664,"Sad, really."
23665,A few weeks?
23666,Covid isnt going away just because the new year...
23667,I have a friend that decided to get on a plane after a tough bout of COVID for 2 weeks.
23668,He went by the 21 day CDC guidelines of first being ill to the tee.
23669,Didn’t get a second test or anything.
23670,"Now he may not be shedding the virus, but people don’t give AF anymore."
23671,My wide an I are the only ones social distancing in our circles and feel like we are completely alone in what we are doing.
23672,You're better off gargling with 3% hydrogen peroxide.
23673,Cheaper and much more powerful.
23674,Ignore shoddy practices at you're own peril.
23675,"He’s saying that “the right” doesn’t become radicalized because of policy choices, they become radicalized because they’re dumb fucks who don’t understand how the world works and are snowflakes about any policy change they don’t like"
23676,We're not even in a lockdown now lol
23677,I forgot a zero.
23678,&gt; I will stand agains't forms of authoritarianism like this.
23679,We all have to sacrifice something to ensure a functioning society.
23680,Vaccines are about the lowest barrier I can think of.

23682,"You’re right, I should have specified that I was responding to those in this thread who are arguing for implementation of this law in the US."
23683,"If you are South African and are satisfied with this law, I’m happy for you and happy that your democracy functions as intended."
23684,I should ask some of my friends from your country how they view the law too.
23685,I will also begin using “probably American” as an insult because that’s really funny to me.
23686,"But to respond to your earlier edit, I think it’s unfair of you to imply nationality has sole bearing on one’s understanding of any particular issue."
23687,I lived for years in Europe and South America.
23688,I’m aware that politics varies from country to country.
23689,"Maybe my initial comment should have been “If those law were to
be implemented in the US, it would radicalize the right.”"
23690,Money.
23691,Bags and bags of money.
23692,So much money that it’s incomprehensible to normal people and they assume the bosses must do it to enforce petty rules and feel superior.
23693,But it’s just money.
23694,You do realize that the doctors and nurses performing surgery wear surgical masks to protect the patient right?
23695,&gt;	How many poor people could have been saved from TB just in the past decade?
23696,10s of millions?
23697,Why are there no charities collecting masks and sending them to Africa like malaria nets?
23698,Considering that TB is spread similarly to COVID-19 I would assume charities do distribute masks during outbreaks.
23699,To not do so would be unwise.
23700,"Also, we’ve had a vaccine against TB since 1906."
23701,It wasn’t used on humans until 1921 and didn’t even see widespread acceptance until after World War II so I’d say modern medicine has made some advances since then.
23702,In fact things could have been much much worse with regard to the current vaccine efforts.
23703,Research into mRNA has been going on in the background for quite some time: “...over a decade of behind-the-scenes research that had new vaccine technology poised for a challenge just as the coronavirus erupted.”  Had that not been the case we’d still be waiting a very long time for someone to fine a vaccine.

23708,Pretty cool milestone.
23709,Of course this is an estimate.
23710,Looking forward to more future positive coronavirus milestones.
23711,On New Year’s Eve millions of people will have gatherings/parties.
23712,Should they?
23713,No.
23714,Are they selfish for doing it?
23715,"I can sympathize with them, but probably."
23716,"However, everyone of these asshats is also to blame:

1."
23717,People who moralized every interaction outside of the house and threw around blind rhetoric.
23718,“You mean you went to the mall?
23719,"You’re killing grandma!”

2."
23720,People who shamed those were struggling with mental health due to the social isolation.
23721,3.
23722,"People who spent the entire year underplaying the importance places like gyms, restaurants, and bars have to people’s lives, and scoffing at any opportunity to at least consider putting the safety protocols in place that would allow these places to be used as safer outlets."
23723,4.
23724,Refusing to give any leeway to even the safest if gatherings.
23725,People were going to be selfish and gather regardless.
23726,The reason so many people don’t give a shit anymore if because of people like you guys.
23727,Congrats on driving people to their breaking point.

23741,"Masks aren't 100% effective, not even close."
23742,"They're the *second* line of defense, to be used in situations where social distancing is impossible."
23743,It is a sad day indeed when you just know L.A. is going to open meeting halls and gymnasiums to triage those that have no where else to go.
23744,I’m asking why immunocompromised people are on phase 2 of the cdc vaccination schedule.
23745,You just gave me reasons why they shouldn’t.
23746,The cdc is recommending they get vaccinated early.
23747,Well in theory you could identify the obese with a scale and a BMI look up table.
23748,It would be an awkward job though.
23749,"Then don't be a fucking idiot, wear a mask."
23750,Its a pretty easy concept to grasp but you still can't quite seem to.
23751,I am.
23752,What are you even talking about??
23753,I live in Florida.
23754,They straight up left California.
23755,They lived in the IE btw..
23756,I would agree with this.
23757,"Far too many people have mild cases, young people are rarely affected to the point of hospitalization or death."
23758,I’ve heard before that the perfect virus would have a IFR of around 3% and be incredibly contagious.
23759,This one is lower than 1%.
23760,[removed]
23761,Under counting is rampant everywhere - like this article mentions.
23762,"But, looking at India's data with consistent availability of testing and the continuous downward trend seems to show they seem be doing well."
23763,WW1 did not make it impossible so much as they didn't take it seriously back when they barely had any medical science to understand it and most people probably still thought germs were devil magic.
23764,"Those people never had a chance, even back in 1911 you have too much international tarvel to think it would stay contained, MAYBE it would not have mutated the way it did AND THAT would have probably helped a lot, but containment would never have been likely to work WW1 or not."
23765,That's just one of those things the history books throw out there to help us not notice our state and federal leaders mostly failed us and millions of people died because of it.
23766,Like.. smallpox killed the Native Americans!!!
23767,"Yeah... and the FUCKING WARS you wages against them time and time again, that kind of had something to do with it too."
23768,Vaccination IDs are quite problematic for several reasons.
23769,Not everyone can take a vaccine.
23770,There is a small percentage of people with auto immune disorders that rely on herd immunity to protect themselves.
23771,They will face oppression with these systems.
23772,"The vaccine has just been introduced, there is no hard data on its effectiveness or longevity."
23773,I find the rush for governments to introduce these systems that are ripe for class discrimination is quite suspect.
23774,"Especially given the lack of data (there is no science to back any of this up) 

Law enforcement can be corrupted."
23775,"I listened to the message of BLM, yet here we are."
23776,Do you think marginalized people will accept yet another reason for law enforcement to stop and frisk them?
23777,This time for showing their face in public?
23778,Or getting detained for not having ID?
23779,Where is the promise to remove these systems when covid is one day hopefully declared over?
23780,"It will back fire, mark my words."
23781,We could reallocate personnel if it is due to not having enough people or we could reallocate vaccines if we are shipping too many to a location that has a high population of those not wanting to take it.
23782,I think the point being made above is that the other 40% of people should get it to protect the “effectively 0” people who can’t.
23783,Oh right.
23784,I forgot about that.
23785,"I try to forget she exists, in general."
23786,"Lots of COVID threads are being invaded by what I assume are some sort of bots or trolls talking about “muh freedumbz.” There’s this weird trend where high-level comments that are against doing anything to stop COVID are very highly upvoted while the opposite are downvoted, and then it flips when you get deeper into the thread, which suggests to me that trolls are out upvoting comments that agree with their point of view but not actually going deep into the thread, where sanity is reasserting itself"
23787,Agreed.
23788,They have banned other sources like the New York Post so there is precedent.
23789,"Makes sense, tea producers would gladly sponsor a study which could prove that tea has some advantages."
23790,It doesn't mean that the study was flawed.

23798,Lots of brother to sister transmission driving this surge.
23799,For sure.
23800,I was just clarifying that there are a lot of factors which influence where healthcare providers may work that are unique to the field.
23801,"Even with those incentives, I personally know many providers who move on as soon as they have worked the minimal amount of time that is contractually obligated for their loan forgiveness program."
23802,"He’s not frontline, maybe high risk but probably not even that given he has access to the best medical care and the cure cocktail that has saved all the fat old politicians who have gotten COVID."
23803,"Shit, he’s lower risk than most."
23804,"40% of Americans don’t have pre-existing conditions *that have shown to be co-morbidities with covid**, or we’d have a much higher death rate."
23805,"Next group is 1b, tier 1 which is workers involved in education and child care,  emergency services, food and agriculture plus everyone 75 and over."
23806,"Firstly, I don't think the Italian and Spanish governments will last very long due to their inherent instability."
23807,"The Spanish government is dependent on the support of secessionist Catalan parties, which, align with the ruling socialist PSOE party, are despised by the centrist, center-right, and right-wing nationalist opposition parties."
23808,"As for Italy, the 5 Stars Movement has seen its support halved ever since the populist right-wing and regionalist Legal Nord blew up the first Conte Government in the summer of 2019."
23809,5S and the social democratic Partido Democratico keep their coalition alive for fear of being slaughtered in an early election by Lega Nord and other populist parties.
23810,"Secondly, 2021 is sort of an important election year in Europe with election in the Netherlands and Germany."
23811,"While the latter only has elections in the fall, the former has its Parliamentary polls on 17 March."
23812,The Netherlands are in a bad position right now as they are in a second lockdown and are only going to start vaccinations on 8 January.
23813,"I suspect that Rutte and his conservative liberal VVD party will come out of this mess unscathed, but the Christian democrat CDA of Health Minister Hugo De Jonge might suffer heavily if business will have to stay closed until then."
23814,They don't get to do it.
23815,"A third party provides them the readout, and the readout only comes when an infection milestone is hit."
23816,They havent seen the data yet or we'd know

23819,"Florida, I'd like you to meet the new coronavirus variant  VUI – 202012/01."
23820,Their body can't handle the vaccine itself.
23821,"I'm going to quote a website because I'm not a professional:
&gt; Vaccines contain weakened or inactive parts of a particular organism (antigen) that triggers an immune response within the body."
23822,"https://www.who.int/news-room/feature-stories/detail/how-do-vaccines-work

So you are introducing parts of the virus to the body in order for your body to be like ""Yooooo this isn't right, lets kill it"" in a low safe kind of way."
23823,"For people who are immunocompromised, it's very invasive to their systems and can do a lot of damage since the immune system is already so week."

23826,I think your math is off.
23827,I have news for you..people choosing to live their lives has nothing to do with their political affiliation.
23828,I’m in the camp of making choices that are best for me and my family.
23829,I have a less than one percent chance of death if I get Covid.
23830,I have a 100 percent chance of being homeless if I listen to “science” that refuses to take into account the psychological side of this.
23831,We are not “dicks” for living our life.
23832,It must be nice to be in a position where these are not your concerns.
23833,Testing in SoCal ramped up back in May.
23834,Anyone can get tested.
23835,I've been tested about 13 times now.
23836,I'm not a Hollywood elite.
23837,Just your average person trying to ensure I don't spread COVID asymptomatically.
23838,"Also, Hollywood employs hundreds of thousands of regular people like you and me."
23839,"But fuck all of them, right?"
23840,"Every time I start thinking I’m right about things, my wrongness hits me in the face!"
23841,Lack of central coordination and direction is why the U.S. has had more infections and deaths than other similar countries.
23842,It isn't ok to just push the vaccines to the states and then blame them.
23843,They need expertise and funding to do the best job possible.
23844,8.75 Billion was in the recent bill [https://www.cnbc.com/2020/12/14/coronavirus-vaccine-distribution-money-at-stake-in-covid-relief-talks.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/12/14/coronavirus-vaccine-distribution-money-at-stake-in-covid-relief-talks.html)
23845,Progress!
23846,Understood.
23847,My point was the 50 million they are trying to produce by year end aren’t all going to the US.
23848,That is why the 50 million is greater than the 40 million US projection.
23849,The US projection also includes moderna.
23850,"On the flip side though, Canadians can get vaccinated in the US."
23851,The article doesn't say what yall are freaking out about.
23852,TL;DR (CLEARLY yall didn't read!
23853,"):
Masks work to slow transmission of disease."
23854,"In future disease outbreaks, it's going to be accepted policy to immediately require mask wearing."
23855,All I hope is that people won’t be shamed for doing this when they are sick after covid is over.
23856,"In my industry, it’s very much come to work unless you are physically unable to walk or talk."
23857,And I bet they’d say you can’t wear a mask either it will scare the customers.
23858,A very reasonable way to distribute the vaccine would be by making potential recipients take anti-body tests.
23859,"If you have them, no vaccine; if you don’t, then pucker up."
23860,But I haven’t seen any writing on this so it’s like...how many vaccine doses are we wasting?
23861,I am taking the average of the whole period.
23862,"Download the .csv table with all the data in it, and highlight all the country’s values on the excel spreadsheet, and look at the average for the whole period."
23863,Did you just reference a wired article as an authority on testing protocols.
23864,What on earth
23865,"No assumption is made, although your comment 


| Clearly, you’re a very privileged person to have never experienced severe violence/war."
23866,"Don’t assume the same of internet-strangers

makes a huge assumption on me."
23867,I've lost a lover to Irans Republican National Guard in early 2000's and worked alongside Syrians while their families were killed in the outskirts of Damascus.
23868,"I'm not armed forces, so have no had need to go into conflict zones but have worked and lived alongside enough people with indirect consequences."
23869,"Privileged or not, globally we are more peaceful in recent decades then any time in history."
23870,"Without terrorist attacks, mainland Europe hasn't experienced war for 70 years and the US mainland territory was only attacked in 1941 and hasn't since."
23871,Today that would make over 600 million souls never experiencing direct conflict or mass death.
23872,"We have migrant movement and know the pockets of unrest, but never has multiple nations been locked down with real threat to life."
23873,"Even in the IRA Troubles of the 90's there was fear, but never civil control such as WW2 or Covid 


Read up on the Global Peace Index."
23874,"Our rankings in recent years has decreased in political tensions, but they're macro economic conflicts and regional which has limited impact outside of small areas."
23875,Climate change is going to upset the index along with inequality in GDP but the notion of mass international population death hasn't occured for nearly 80 years.
23876,Kid trials on the vaccines will be completed in a few months.
23877,"And they are spreaders, part of the herd, so to achieve herd immunity, they will need to get vaccinated too."
23878,Why does it take two weeks to vaccinate healthcare workers?
23879,"We know where they are, they are surrounded by people who know how to administer shots, and professionals who know how to distribute medicine."
23880,It should have taken 3 days at the outside.
23881,The world is burning down and the people in charge of fixing it are in business as usual mode.
23882,In addition I would recommend A Journal of the Plague Year (1660s) which was a contemporary account of a really terrible plague and time overall.
23883,It's English centric.
23884,"Another, lighter book I've loved is ""A distant mirror"" which is a fictionalised account of a real person's experience during the 14th century plague."
23885,He went to a party during a pandemic he doesn't care about other people... $5000 is nothing for him lol.. he's still gonna travel and get other people sick.
23886,Most of these people don't think that covid is a big deal even if they do get it..
23887,"Yeah, this is not exactly a new revelation."
23888,But it is still higher than the flu significantly.
23889,"You are acting like there is no risk to young people, but there has been a high incidence of strokes linked to COVID in young people: https://www.thelancet.com/journals/laneur/article/PIIS1474-4422(20)30272-6/fulltext

This is not true, in your own article from your original link; 80% do not go to the hospital where ~20% do go."
23890,"That's assuming the infection rate was much higher, where those serological tests had vastly overestimated the people with natural immunity."
23891,Death is not the only bad outcome btw
23892,That's like saying cockfighting boosts moral.
23893,Maybe for the sick fucks who find it amusing but that doesn't make it any less fucked up.
23894,I was wondering about identification too.
23895,"Age is easy and certain health care workers are probably also easy, you could just vaccinate the employees at all hospitals and clinics."
23896,But how do you identify someone who is diabetic or obese or with a cardiac condition?
23897,Do they need a doctor's note?
23898,You could just let people self-identify themselves and go by the honor system.
23899,You'll have some people screwing up but as long as you get a steady supply of people at least half of which are the right ones you'll make major strides.
23900,They aren't vastly different.
23901,You're proving my point.
23902,"There is zero downside to submitting to the EMA, today, as they have similar enough expectations...
*If* the data are truly complete."
23903,"The problem is, the studies arent as clean as anyone hoped it would be be."
23904,They submitted to UK based on the UK trial data *only*.
23905,"The entire point is, there are zero real benefits to EMA approval by getting MHRA first."
23906,None.
23907,They are independent and will conduct the reviews separately.
23908,Gotta say that's quite harsh
23909,You can’t expect more from this source.
23910,Good work you did there!
23911,"The combination of vulnerable being vaccinated and spread dropping due, will make this much less deadly way before herd immunity."
23912,"I am shocked, SHOCKED."
23913,"Despite 100% compliance with mask usage, social distancing, and only doing essential business folks in LA county are still getting infected!"
23914,Oh...wait
23915,I couldn't agree more.
23916,I too had to take the meningitis shot for the exact same reasons :)
23917,It's been a year dude.
23918,They were not forthright about it.
23919,Even Chinese students that go to the UW in Seattle say this.
23920,They know their own government better than you do obviously.
23921,Stop simping for that communist government.
23922,I live in Alabama.
23923,My extended family have been throwing get togethers with 30+ people with no masks.
23924,They have directly told me I'm stupid and brainwashed for wearing one.
23925,Thank goodness.
23926,I guess the countries that drink a lot of tea are probably in good shape then.
23927,/s
23928,"Yeah, I know what a sympathizer sounds like."
23929,You don't need to explain.
23930,"""Unfortunately, China is only taking more steps at repressing information about the outbreak, such as sentencing Zhang Zhan, a journalist who reported on the epidemic in Wuhan, to four years in prison."
23931,"The communist regime now blames most local outbreaks on imported frozen food and has started to peddle misinformation that the virus came from another country."""
23932,"https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4089458

How many people in Western countries were imprisoned for reporting the truth about the pandemic?"
23933,"You seem to be a numbers person, but you want to paint all sources with the same brush.."
23934,The numbers don't mean shit when the source is shit.
23935,Yes but I’m assuming most countries don’t want their hospital beds filling up with foreigners who have more severe Covid symptoms.
23936,"If someone is vaccinated, the likelihood of them needing to be hospitalized goes down."
23937,"“Less mess” for other countries to deal with, to put it bluntly."
23938,Better for travel insurance companies too.
23939,"Released what doctors, no doctors were detained."
23940,"Cautioned, yes."
23941,Detained no.
23942,But good for you for getting that irrelevant point in here.
23943,I’m in the AZ trial as well.
23944,"There’s a 2/3 chance that we got the vaccine, but we may have gotten the placebo."
23945,She may want to drop out in order to get one of the already-approved vaccines.
23946,"If it looks like it will help the Republicans win Georgia, Mitch will sign off on it, and it will pass."
23947,"Do we lock down nations and the global economy to avoid the incidence of post viral flu in a typical bad flu year, or do we accept it as “life”?"
23948,What apart from chimplike emotional behaviour fed with reckless media scaremongering makes Covid so special?
23949,[removed]
23950,Catchy headlines get the clicks.
23951,It hasn’t even been a year yet.
23952,Spanish flu didn’t become as deadly until the second wave.
23953,And then there is AIDS where the infection takes years to kill you.
23954,We don’t know what can happen with covid.
23955,"Well, inoculation means 'being vaccinated'."
23956,"You wouldn't say 'I've had measles so I'm inoculated', you'd say 'I've had measles so I don't need to be inoculated'."
23957,Nah I don't care once its over.
23958,U really think people do this shit for fun?
23959,Weird way of thinking.
23960,Just stop.
23961,Nobody's buying it.
23962,He lied.
23963,Enough with the spin and gaslighting.
23964,"I can totally see where you're coming from with this but the ""just one more month"" thing has lost a lot of steam."
23965,"We've been hearing ""just two weeks"" or ""just two months"" for, like, 9+ months at this point."
23966,"Eventually, you start to not believe it anymore."
23967,"Again, I see where you're coming from and I agree!"
23968,"But looking at it from a psychological standpoint... the whole ""just wait"" thing doesn't work anymore."
23969,We’ve already vaccinated a couple million.
23970,I would love a vaccine so I can actually get my imaging and surgeries done that have been put off this year.
23971,&gt; In order to hit target we'll have to be vaccinating people at roughly 10-25x our current rate.
23972,This should be possible.
23973,"In the U.S., last year 175 million people were vaccinated."
23974,"If we assume that the vaccinations took place over 5 months (which I think is an eminently reasonable assumption), that is 35 million flu shots per month."
23975,"Not quite 50-60 million, but a lot of the way there, without us pulling out all of the stops."
23976,I don't think the fact that they are ramping up more slowly than expected indicated much about whether they will be able to get to where we need to be.
23977,&gt; Also important to note that as we vaccinate more people participation will decrease.
23978,The people who need/want it most are at the front of the line in their respective categories.
23979,The way to correct for this would be to expand the availability--allow people outside of the priority groups to be vaccinated (or expand the size of the priority groups).
23980,I can basically guarantee you that many more than 100 million people would line up today to get the shot if it were available to them.
23981,I don't think it makes sense to substantially slow down vaccination rates just to make sure people are getting it in the properly prioritized order.
23982,Greedy /s
23983,"No, he is talking about the first outbreak of H5N1 in humans."
23984,"Infected 18 humans, killed 6."
23985,1.5 million chickens were culled.
23986,"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11938498/

The first SARS-CoV-1 outbreak was in 2003."
23987,Are nurses required to wear dresses there?
23988,"Because when you deal with something day in and day out for 9 months and nothing seems to be improving, you give up and stop caring."
23989,lol
23990,"Thanks, I know how vaccines work."
23991,"I realize that some people with allergies and auto immune disorders will not be able to take them, which is exactly why I will take them when it's my turn."
23992,All I'm saying is vaccine cards are already a thing and have been around for a long while.
23993,It's not a new concept that's created for covid.
23994,It's already there.
23995,I don't understand why people are freaking out over something that already exists and is in practice in many places around the world.
23996,"Just under 2 years ago I took a yellow fever vaccine while travelling through East Africa, because Ethiopia required it for entry."
23997,I had the freedom to refuse the vaccine; noone forced me to take it or not take it.
23998,"While I have my personal freedom, Ethiopia also has the freedom to refuse tourists who don't show proof of yellow fever vaccine and I respect that."
23999,"I trust in the scientific process and am not anti-vax, this was honestly no big deal so I took the vaccine and continued my travels."
24000,I intend to do the same with the covid vaccine.
24001,"If certain countries don't wish to allow in travelers who have not taken the covid vaccine, I respect that."
24002,I'm sure there's already a mechanism in place for those people who are unable to take these vaccines due to medical reasons but wish to travel around the world.
24003,What is china gonna release another one?
24004,!
24005,Ah ok
24006,"Your posting the first bulletin again, which is based off those serological tests that I disagree with."
24007,"The publication was for way back in May, and it is now clear that nowhere near the estimated number of people had actually been infected."
24008,I'm disagreeing with you because I disagree with the premise.
24009,The main brunt if people affected by the flyer were the under 5 category and the 70+.
24010,I believe the 10 and under crowd are less affected by COVID than the flu.
24011,"This more infectious strain from the UK may change that, although that is wild speculation at best."
24012,"You post the CDC's estimates for the IFR for COVID, but you don't bother to post them for the flu before making the assertion that it really only affects those 70+ more."
24013,"https://www.cdc.gov/flu/about/burden/2019-2020.html#:~:text=CDC%20estimates%20that%20the%20burden,flu%20deaths%20(Table%201)."
24014,"Actually it IS comparable to how it affects age groups to the flu, but by a factor of 5."
24015,Just do the math on this.
24016,"Really bad flu seasons only killed 80K people, where as 340K have died AT LEAST from COVID."
24017,"That's quadruple a really bad flu season, and that's with the lock down measures."
24018,"Even Chinese students that go to the UW in Seattle say this, they know what their government is like."
24019,So don't blame me for saying the truth.
24020,This is what is happening in the US.
24021,My cousins wife is pregnant and a physician.
24022,She sees patients.
24023,I believe she will take it once out of the first trimester.
24024,"This reminds of me of a [Joe Rogan podcast](https://youtu.be/E3URhJx0NSw), where Joe Rogan asked a renowned infectious disease expert when sauna protects you against COVID 19 (because heat deactivated pathogens in general)

Expert response unless you are directly transferring hot steaming air into your lungs, it will not prevent or cure you from getting the disease."
24025,"Even if you did, you will just burn your lungs instead."
24026,"So I think your reasoning is similar, unless somehow you flood tea into your respiratory system, no it won't prevent or cure you  COVID 19."
24027,"I'm sure it's partially the enforcement but plenty of places around the country and world are able to abide by wearing masks without enforcement, i'd dare say it's the norm."
24028,"No, what you're seeing is straight up personal entitlement fostered through a 'holier than thou' way of thinking."
24029,A beacon of hope in this insane world
24030,US England and Italy wee reporting the highest death rates in the world.
24031,If they are doing a cover up they are the worst in the world at it.
24032,Annoys me to no end.
24033,Mpumalanga here.
24034,"Relatively few cases, but people becoming lax."
24035,"Walk around inside the mall without a mask, just to put one one when entering a store."
24036,"Like Jesus people, how fucking stupid are you?"
24037,Good luck to you and yours buddy
24038,I see 30million by March.
24039,Are they threatening us?
24040,Yeah they do seem very slow but lets see if they speed up when they see the UK vaccinating millions per week of the Oxford vaccine whilst they still mull over paperwork.
24041,It will only get worse before it gets better.
24042,Isn't that what Fauci said?
24043,This shouldn't be a surprise.
24044,Im expecting a big hit mid January.
24045,I’m so excited for this!
24046,"For general pop, not rich politicians."
24047,Most Americans wish 15-20% of the old politicians would die... not many have.
24048,Good healthcare saves lives!
24049,They should make healthcare for all a priority or something.
24050,At least someone knows which ones I'm referring to.
24051,"I heard that the rule is cloth masks now, we'll see if it's enforced."
24052,"But yeah, glasses wearer here too."
24053,This is why it's extremely important to keep virus numbers way down.
24054,People in the US have been vaccinated.
24055,"Mostly healthcare workers and politicians, though"
24056,I was seeing articles about the vials as early as June-July.
24057,They've had months to prepare... doesn't seem like it should be a major problem.
24058,"Thwt damn Bill gates injecting us just so we buy more Microsoft products

24059,"Oh dear: https://thehill.com/policy/healthcare/531913-us-hospitalizations-from-covid-19-hit-all-time-high

You were saying?"
24060,&gt;but with better staffing should speed that up pretty quick.
24061,This is the reason I was happy to see the stimulus pass (even if it was small).
24062,Hopefully the money for vaccine distribution will be used to hire staff to give the doses in various places
24063,This is the United States.
24064,Planning ahead is a relative term.
24065,Yes - but not through inoculation!
24066,Do we know that?
24067,"(I’m not being a smart-ass, genuinely curious.)"
24068,I mean honestly one person can say all of that stuff.
24069,It’s how I feel.
24070,"Now that it’s so close, delays feel so painful."
24071,Donate blood.
24072,"If you had it, you might have antibodies"
24073,"They are needed in rural areas, and without higher pay you won’t get doctors to go."
24074,"""from a medical perspective not a social perspective"" wtf does that even mean."
24075,"Obviously **less people dying / infected is better for society**, regardless of risk factor."
24076,"People's mindsets are so twisted here, I swear."
24077,I've never actually had a fever from any vaccine I've taken.
24078,Just get a sore arm for 1 or 2 days
24079,What sorts of tort reform are associated with single payer healthcare systems?
24080,Understandable mentality.
24081,I wish more people who could have self-restricted over the holidays with the U.S. at peak hospitalizations.
24082,"In a month, things will be getting better."
24083,"Had people waited a bit longer to visit family, we could have avoided a lot of death."
24084,Maybe even with the grandparents they went to visit starting to be vaccinated.
24085,"By May or before, I think you should feel ok doing the things you feel like you need to do for your mental health."
24086,I'm sure you think you are making a point with those headline grabbed facts but not really relevant to what we discussing in this thread.

24088,;)
24089,"The three graphs are 1) total hospitalizations, 2) ICU, 3) ICU + respirator"
24090,This sub is infested with CCP downvote trolls....Reddit and the mods here should really get it under control.
24091,They are allowing China to manipulate the discourse and spread propaganda and lies.
24092,I'm not really sure where you're going with this.
24093,I feel that you are basically saying 'well China was involved in a massive cover-up and that is why we are in this situation'.
24094,"If I was to pick the 'most open' countries for information I would probably say Belgium, Taiwan, New Zealand, Italy and Australia."
24095,"Even with this, Italy's information released was quite in line with China's."
24096,China's point loss in my view was for stifling whistle blowers.
24097,It is easy to forget that China had one of the hardest shutdowns around (10% of the worlds population hard shut down) in January.
24098,The information that mattered was all available months before the virus got out of hand.
24099,"That we didn't hear from the couple of people that wanted the alarm to be sounded louder was unjust and terrible - but they weren't really 'hiding' much information - unless you think as well that US, UK, Italy, France, Germany, Belgium and all of the other countries hit hard in the first wave were 'covering it up', well, the case and death numbers are quite in line with one another."
24100,Yes!
24101,Lets get steal this idea America!
24102,"True, but natural immunity is not inoculation."
24103,Statistically speaking there is virtually no risk to young people.
24104,The CDC estimates that the fatality rate for age 0-19 is 0.00003%.
24105,"For kids 12 and under it is so small it is reported as zero in most areas, though there are a few isolated cases."
24106,"Yes there is some tiny risk to young people but they are at risk for all kinds of highly unlikely things like cancer, mono, STD's, the flu, flesh-eating bacteria and car accidents, etc."
24107,These tragic reports of young people getting strokes or long term effects are tragic but also just extremely unlikely anecdotes.
24108,You can't make a nationwide health care plan based on the 0.0001% cases.
24109,Oxford will be approved in the UK in the next few days.
24110,[The trials were clearly short of ideal initially but Astra/Zeneca's boss says new data show it is effective.

24113,These have all been shown to be co-morbidities with COVID?
24114,That's a standard nurses uniform.
24115,Oh dear lord I totally screwed up reading the thread.
24116,I thought you were saying *I was the alt account trolling*.
24117,Ha ha!
24118,I clearly did not get enough sleep.
24119,My apologies.
24120,I fully agree with you (obvious if you check my earlier replies) not the wackos.
24121,🤦
24122,I enrolled in the AZ trial in November before any vaccine had gotten EUA.
24123,I received my first injection from AZ at the end of November.
24124,I was due for my 2nd dose of AZ this week.
24125,"However, I'm a critical care nurse so the Pfizer vaccine was made available to me last week."
24126,I talked with the study doc and decided to take the Pfizer vaccine.
24127,I will not get my 2nd dose of AZ but will get a 2nd dose of Pfizer.
24128,Actually Slovenia was barely touched until November.
24129,Believe it or not Italy’s peak deaths per day was higher in the December wave than the March one as well
24130,"i imagine that curve will be flattened eventually, but getting past the holidays and getting vaccines into as many offices, hospitals, nursing homes, etc as possible will help things speed up a lot."
24131,"surely some of the ones who have received vaccines haven't been able to inject them all at this point, but with better staffing should speed that up pretty quick."
24132,Maybe they shouldn't have declared victory like half a dozen times since this started.
24133,I guess it varies between countries.
24134,In the UK I think the Pfizer vaccine is not approved for under 16s and I believe pregnant women are currently advised not to take it pending further trials.
24135,But I could be wrong.
24136,China lied??
24137,?
24138,"By ""lockdown"" I'm referring to any form of restrictions.. restaurant capacity restrictions, mask mandates, travel restrictions."
24139,I know we're not in a true lockdown.
24140,You act like the MHRA and EMA have vastly different criteria - I don't see any evidence for that.
24141,They are both highly reputable regulators who will not approve a vaccine that doesn't show safety and efficacy.
24142,"Given the data is more complicated surrounding the AZ vaccine in regards to dosing, going through 1 regulator first makes sense as any issues that arise can be sorted so when they apply for approval from other agencies, those issues will not be there and the approval will be quicker."
24143,And it makes sense to start with the MHRA as they approved the trial and know the most about the ChAdOx technology than any other regulator.
24144,"I'm taking and support the vaccine, but this is fucked!"
24145,This is essentially like a sex offender registry.
24146,This is opening the gates for more government control in the future.
24147,"The whole ""comply or you don't get to do x,y, or z""."
24148,"(Before anyone starts, I'm pro people getting the vaccine, I just feel this is the wrong approach and will cause more vaccine skepticism in the long run)"
24149,It's not about punishment but stopping spread.
24150,If you're prone to getting the disease it means you will infect people that haven't had the vaccine yet.
24151,Why would you be traveling if you haven't had the vaccine anyways?
24152,Makes no sense.
24153,This isn’t an attack on anyone but personally I think people need to get over their ridiculous fear of masks.
24154,They’re a minor thing for a selfless act.
24155,"And secondly, employers need to stop kidding around and offer people adequate sick pay."
24156,It’s a joke and quite frankly disgusting that people come in and spread their illness all over the place.
24157,I was living in NZ last year when a girl in my team came down with measles (they were going through an outbreak at the time).
24158,"At the same time as her, I came down with the same symptoms and was horrifically ill."
24159,"I fell ill as she kept coming in in order to get paid, and then it cost me $800 in unpaid work, medicine and doctor fees."
24160,Absolute joke.
24161,i think he's talking about long term impacts
24162,"Yes, I've been wondering when the numbers will migrate too since they've dropped so significantly since the 23rd in the US."
24163,"NYC seroprevalence was 27%, with 25k official deaths."
24164,Wuhan seroprevalence according to this news was 4.4% with \~3k official deaths.
24165,These seroprevalence studies more or less corroborate what we already know from hospital data.
24166,The virus is more contagious and less lethal than case fatality rates indicate.
24167,[removed]
24168,I just want to know if she got see a big flashy 'quest completed' banner when she got it.
24169,That was perfect!
24170,&gt;	 2.
24171,Show me any evidence that the incidence or severity of long covid is not a manifestation of Post Viral Syndrome encounter with other viral infections.
24172,"Regardless, it is a current risk after having the coronavirus that most normal people would rather not have."
24173,Your point here is moot.
24174,I personally would not care about whether my long haul symptoms were a “manifestation of Post Viral Symptoms” or not.
24175,I would just be upset that I got long haul symptoms.
24176,"&gt;ineffectual 

Makes it sound like you're trying to be smarter than you really are."
24177,I'd drop it.
24178,I doubt you've learned anything about WHO other than a few soundbytes.
24179,"It's not a place people tend to be interested in, other than EVERY once and awhile, so it's hard to have any real opinion that matters or believe you do without adding up decades of information and doing weeks of research to have and honest opinion."
24180,"There is a much greater chance you're just mad and talking out your ass and I can't take the time to verify one or the other, so I have to just go with my guess."
24181,california has almost double the population of florida so you have to account for that.
24182,the other (non political) explanation would be to look at the per capita totals as of three weeks ago (right before the california spike) and see what level of herd immunity florida would have or not have.
24183,compare also testing per capita to see which state has more accurate numbers.
24184,consider that florida reports 40% of their deaths over a month late so you'll have to scale any deaths per case estimation backwards a bit more for them.
24185,it's also worth noting which cities or regions of each state has already been hit versus which are getting hit now.
24186,Lol yes we’re pearl clutchers by calling them out when they even way below their own estimates (10% of their actual estimate).
24187,Damn if this website's accurate and we really drop below 10k infections by June 1st that would be truly amazing
24188,No they just said I might have gotten the stomach version of it and that it was really bad that year.
24189,I didn’t get any sure results though.
24190,They told me to just stop trying to force food for a few hours and then start with jello in small amounts.
24191,"It helped, but the hunger and lack of food tasting or feeling like food made me extremely anxious for a while."
24192,"Yeah, I just get the car warranty one, and I don't have a car."
24193,But can you describe the call you got about vaccinations?
24194,"My concern is that unlike yourself most people are conditioned to hang up on recorded calls, and if that is how they intend to inform people it won't work well."
24195,I don't see the connection.
24196,"Covid is not a ""benign"" virus."
24197,Highly deadly viruses are snuffed out quickly.
24198,"With the Ebola virus, only symptomatic people could spread it."
24199,"And by the time someone with Ebola is symptomatic, they are dying."
24200,They can’t go to a gathering or work to spread the virus.
24201,Rules for humor: jokes must be funny.
24202,"When a joke is repeating part of a misinformation campaign, it’s not  funny, therefore not a joke."
24203,Disneyland workers?
24204,WTF?
24205,That’s terrible.
24206,"Yes, it's terrible, viruses often put the body at risk of developing serious bacterial infections."
24207,"&gt;you can have a Democratic government that is trying, but still enough conservative shitbirds to wreck pandemic control

Blaming conservatives in... Los Angeles?"
24208,I'm trying to make a point that stereotyping states is a bad thing to do.
24209,"There are millions of people in those states who are not science-deniers, as there may be millions in states you like that are."
24210,No more than the US did.
24211,Our numbers from the first wave were also off by roughly a factor of 10.
24212,"Either come in to the police station ""voluntarily"" or we come and arrest you."
24213,Big fucking difference!
24214,Are you really this stupid?
24215,[removed]
24216,"First it was the reduced dosage, then this, what post-hoc discovery comes next?"
24217,"Not to be dramatic, but a more extreme version of this was seen during the Black Plague."
24218,"All of the people who knew anything about healing herbs and such died off, and then you were left with people who knew anything about plants/gardening in general, and then you were left with just pure superstition."
24219,"Obviously this is not the same thing, at all, but there is a parallel here, what with elderly retired doctors being called in, nurses and med students being fast tracked in places like Italy in order to help out, etc."
24220,Good thing we keep thousands of birds all cramped together in the same place!
24221,Your memory of early 2020 is very different from my memory of early 2020.
24222,That’s okay.
24223,At least we’re moving forward.
24224,[removed]
24225,Why can't covid infected peoplec be told to stay home and die?
24226,Or fight it?
24227,You think you can save these fat worthless sack of crap Americans?
24228,They are unfit and ill. Covid is a gift.
24229,Let them die.
24230,Isn't science all about taking new evidence and changing your mind?
24231,"I mean, Newton's ideas about gravity were cool and all but we happily listened to Einstein when he gave us relativity."
24232,"So when Fauci states something tomorrow that doesn't gel with today, that's not being hypocritical - that's accepting that reality changes."
24233,"That’s what I assume too, but I cannot find any information on the topic."
24234,Everything I find says to stop drinking if you have covid.
24235,I cannot find any guidance on how a person should ramp down to avoid complications from withdrawal.
24236,I wouldn’t be so sure that opinions of Fauci won’t change.
24237,"Before I read that NYT article, I may have had some criticisms of him, but I still believed he was fundamentally honest."
24238,"And I’m sorry, but I don’t accept your analogy."
24239,"You’re right: for an obese person, it’s equally true that losing 20 pounds or losing 80 pounds would lessen the risk of a heart attack."
24240,But it is not equally true that herd immunity from Covid-19 is achieved at 70% or 90%.
24241,"One of these two figures is closer to being accurate than the other, because “herd immunity” denotes a very specific set of conditions with certain requirements."
24242,The doctor in your analogy isn’t being misleading; they are simply choosing to frame the facts in a certain way.
24243,"Fauci was, and is, being deliberately misleading."
24244,They messed up: [https://www.spiegel.de/international/europe/the-planning-disaster-germany-and-europe-could-fall-short-on-vaccine-supplies-a-3db4702d-ae23-4e85-85b7-20145a898abd](https://www.spiegel.de/international/europe/the-planning-disaster-germany-and-europe-could-fall-short-on-vaccine-supplies-a-3db4702d-ae23-4e85-85b7-20145a898abd)
24245,Exactly.
24246,So many people on high flow oxygen survived.
24247,Most of them do okay.
24248,Guarantee they would all be dead 100 years ago.
24249,"Yes wasn't arrested, there's a huge difference with being sent a message asking you to come to your local police station than being arrested."
24250,Pretty obvious really.
24251,If he was arrested he probably wouldn't have been seen for days.
24252,"Facts pal facts, stick to them."
24253,I think perhaps you are forgetting that _every_ country has absurd under-reporting from January-July.
24254,The highest daily cases in Italy before June was 6.5k - daily deaths at this period were ~700.
24255,With a fatality rate of ~1.3% then Italy was underreporting by 90% as well.
24256,Is that problematic too?
24257,"The same holds for USA, France, the UK, Belgium (who I consider one of the most honest reporters)."
24258,The capability just wasn't there back then to do proper surveillance.
24259,You can't shut surgery down...what are you gonna do leave people in pain?
24260,People need surgery.
24261,The reality is these fat out of shape jerks need to just die at home and save us the grief.
24262,Prevent panic?
24263,Who  sounds like Trump now?
24264,Fuck off
24265,Do I need to explain why enforcing mask mandates is harmful and equivalent to stop and frisk patrols by law enforcement?
24266,This time they stop and frisk you for showing your face in public?
24267,"I call that an over reach, not a public safety measure."
24268,How will it disproportionately affect Blacks?
24269,"These police foot and squad car patrols have a higher frequency in places where marginilized people live, usually people of color."
24270,They will bear the brunt force of these laws.
24271,Not the white rural confederates that are the obvious pseudo targets of these measures.
24272,"Umm, 3 months apart... that sucks."
24273,Pfizer and Moderna both get to that point in &lt;1 month.
24274,Right.
24275,People were literally attacking 5g towers.
24276,"We need that ""/s"" to let the idiots know that we aren't actually on their side and that we are making fun of them."
24277,But still no talks of league suspension?
24278,"Florida only ranked 25th in new Virus cases last week ending Dec 28th per the CDC, but California ranked first, cases exploded there last week--Florida remains at 27th place overall in the country, yet everything here is open, unlike California, and the economy here is solid, unlike California and many other states"
24279,"Eh, maybe, but I don't see many colleges continuing online only because people won't pay for it."
24280,And those corona bros are going to be regarded as losers once peoples are vaccinated and it warm out people will want their lives back.
24281,The new strain is extraordinarily contagious and masks aren't effective enough against it.
24282,Would need a lockdown to stop it.
24283,And I thought we were all supposed to be one country working together..
24284,Congratulations you've successfully projected arguments against Christian beliefs onto Judaism which is completely different
24285,Wish I had her healthcare plan
24286,People like me?
24287,What is that message?
24288,Maybe I should use the word earn?
24289,Here I’ll use it in a sentence.
24290,My black coworker earned a promotion over me because of his hard work ethic and dedication to the company.
24291,(true story btw).
24292,BLMs message is “blame the white man” and “all police are bad”.
24293,sorry but that isn’t something I can get behind.
24294,They should focus on ways to elevate their community and work together to build trust with the local government.
24295,It should be our top priority.
24296,"A universal flu vaccine

And universal coronavirus vaccine

Those should be top, #1 priority immediately since we finally got our ass beat by a virus and can remember it."
24297,We will forget very soon.
24298,"I'm wondering, since masks loose effectiveness when they become moist, would constantly wearing one outside make them less safe (as warm breath in cold air leads to a damp mask)?"
24299,"And if that is the case, would a damp mask be more risky than taking it off when going outside (which is bad, as handling your mask is not a good idea)?"
24300,He absolutely did lie about it.
24301,There are times when I think that the media is full of lazy parasites who contribute nothing to society.
24302,This gaslighting is fooling no one who puts in a minute of effort to do a google search.
24303,"What Fauci said early on was a lie, plain as day."
24304,Agreed.
24305,"I’m just shocked that, especially given my health situation, expressing any hesitancy about getting a brand new vaccine or one with a slight risk to degrading my health solicits a reaction like I’m a Facebook measles party mom...."
24306,I would say 90% of people I’ve spoken to react that way.
24307,"Ironically, with my health condition I have to get immunized against a lot of things that most people don’t take vaccines for, like pneumonia and shingles and more esoteric viruses."
24308,"Everyone thinks flu shots when they think vaccines but man, Prevnar had me in bed with flu like malaise for 3 days and took two weeks for my lymph nodes to stop hurting."
24309,I would do it again because it’s better than dying of pneumonia but it ain’t no walk in the park.
24310,I’ll moan and groan all I want about getting one of these potent vaccines.
24311,The relevant parties are indemnified... now.
24312,Your idea brings in new parties and new roles for existing entities.
24313,"No, but noone would think of this as misinformation as it's clearly a joke."
24314,"Unless you're stupid, and judging by your reply to the joke, it seem like you are pretty stupid."
24315,"""Comply or you don't do x, y, z"" is built into every society that existed past, present, or future in some way shape or form."
24316,Punishment is part of the rule of law.
24317,"We see how well government issued ""suggestions"" work."
24318,Don't get me started on how well relying on each citizen's sense of responsibility to their community is going over.
24319,Hungarians?
24320,"But imagine, the health officials in Sweden talking to each other, ""Hey, by Scandinavian standards our people have been dying ten times faster than our neighbours, but hey we're doing slightly better than... Hungary."
24321,We must be doing something right...
24322,"right?"""
24323,Then the super powers start manifesting.
24324,"Stop spreading misinformation, even if it is a joke, it is dangerous."
24325,Broken clocks can show the correct time twice a day (I am Israeli btw)
24326,But that attitude is rooted in the denial aspect of a fear response.
24327,Like people who refuse to acknowledge a spouse's obvious infidelity until the catch them in the act.
24328,And ask this time Curevac could be producing the Biobtech vaccine in their facilities.
24329,"But noooo, we want a third mRNA vaccine..."
24330,Uhhhhh because there wasn’t a brand new **global pandemic** without a vaccine going on before that.
24331,It’s sad that you actually think you’re making a point.
24332,They are.
24333,I'm taking a lot of downvotes but I don't give a shit.
24334,They think they will fucking silence us this way.
24335,They are wrong!
24336,This is how they get to taste freedom...by being allowed to play on the Western internet so they can distort public opinion in CCP's favour.
24337,"Look here, China has a diverse geography and rich geologic history."
24338,"Huh, I wonder why"
24339,Welcome to 2020
24340,Worst run state in the country.
24341,Exactly.
24342,"Most bad diseases of the past killed the vulnerable, which included children."
24343,This just happens to be mild in children and youth.
24344,"If it was fatal in children as much as it is in older adults, our society would completely shut down."
24345,"Stores would close, schools would close, workers would stay gone unless they were *literally actually starving."
24346,* The wealthy would run for their vacation homes and ride it out.
24347,It would be a complete disaster.
24348,"In the country I live in, people caught not wearing a mask can face up to three years in jail and fines of as much as $55,000."
24349,"Looks at me and learn, hugo Is gay buhahaha!"
24350,These cold vaccines need temp alarms.
24351,Just something noisy that goes off 10 degrees before the vaccines get too warm.
24352,A sad loss.
24353,"Stockpile N95s yes, but it is also important that they be maintained."
24354,"One of the issues early on in the pandemic is that the N95s that were already in the stockpile, many of the rubber bands were old and would snap in half while being worn."
24355,This all thanks to budget cuts in the early Trump years.
24356,Lol.
24357,Wasn't really arrested.
24358,That's what they call it China.
24359,Fake arresting?
24360,"Just like fake charges, fake crimes, and fake coronavirus reporting by fake journalists."
24361,"I get it especially when people have not been supported financially and business go under, jobs get lost, ect."
24362,I don't think we should have even been asking people to try to make that choice.
24363,I entirely understand how a restaurant owner is incentivized to believe that cornavirus is just not that serious.
24364,Their business and their employees depend on them believing that it isn't that bad and you should just risk it.
24365,We should have paid people to stay home before Christmas knowing that infections would spike from travel and there is an approved vaccine.
24366,Messaging has been bad an mixed.
24367,Everything from saying that it is a hoax to needing herd immunity to resume any normalcy.
24368,Those fucking idiots still believing laws can solve problems.
24369,Barbara W. Tuchman.
24370,"It's marketed as non-fiction as it's based on the writings and life of a real person but it's of the genre of say ""Greenlanders"" or ""Salt"" in the way that the reality of the situation is made interesting by the way the author has filled in the bits and pieces."
24371,I just checked on Goodreads and amazon for excerpts so I think you can get a flavour of the style.
24372,They are the sort of books which made such an impression on me that I remember the author and title which I very seldom do as I read pretty constantly.
24373,[removed]
24374,"I know it's not uncommon for docs to have a plane, I'm just pointing out not all docs fly themselves some do, some don't."
24375,Same here.
24376,"They do socialize somewhat with each other here, but we have learned that there's no point in socializing with them since they'll inevitably turn to politics and then it's just painful to listen to what these otherwise capable people have decided to believe, and how they reject any information that conflicts with their views."
24377,I have to deal with it in my own family as well.
24378,"It gets real old, real fast."
24379,Actually he did lie about it.
24380,The idiot should have told everybody straight up to use home made or layered cloth masks for protection and let the professionals have the real N95 masks.
24381,Fauci did in fact butcher this big time.
24382,"Also, nothing stopped them from *recommending* masks to begin with."
24383,They don't really have to wait for a law to pass before putting out a recommendation.
24384,People would most likely have listened even though there were no repercussions for not wearing one.
24385,You can say the same thing about half of Europe's leaders lol
24386,Or 80 times higher like I am pretty sure they are...
24387,"Either way if you multiply the current and past case number by 8 (CDC estimates) to 80 (study estimates) you get a CFR and IFR that is much lower and makes you wonder why focused protection was not implemented, still to this day, or sooner..."
24388,"Source: https://medicalxpress.com/news/2020-06-covid-infection-greater.html

Source: https://www.pix11.com/news/coronavirus/cdc-estimates-only-1-8th-of-coronavirus-infections-caught"
24389,"Lucky you, for me it feels like months."
24390,"Can't wait for the vaccine to be widely available, mental health is taking an exponential hit."
24391,"Depending on how much you drink, quitting cold turkey is dangerous on its own so I assume it would be pretty rough on someone with covid as well?"
24392,"But being a complete tool, like you, is"
24393,"I can’t take the coronavirus vaccine for medical reasons.The particular group I’m a part of wasn’t included in the initial trials.So,thats a no from me."
24394,"No, that's Europe, Europeans have been hit much harder than the US has last two months"
24395,[deleted]
24396,So you complain about the source and make personal attacks because you cannot refute that AZ cherry picked data from multiple disparate trials.
24397,California is a failure.
24398,We are drowning in COVID patients.
24399,Short nurses and doctors and Newsom doesn’t have the balls to pause plastic/cosmetic surgeries and close all the med spas in the state.
24400,A massive pool of resources being used up for Botox and boob jobs.
24401,Apparently not everyone here agrees.
24402,At least there are some left on Reddit who actually think.
24403,"Normally I would, but one individual is a nurse practitioner who’s spent a lot of time in school and working in the field."
24404,"Disneyland workers, seriously?"
24405,Is Disney land even open during a pandemic?
24406,Disney land is most certainly not essential.
24407,If only that were the case.
24408,"There might be an initial exponential growth in people being trained to inject things, but I'd guess most nurses have some basic competence there, then only linear with time and number of practitioners after that (oh, assuming the basic distribution systems aren't the limiting factor)."
24409,"A glimmer of light, nevertheless."
24410,"Please feel free to direct me to the article in the NYT that says 'Fauci wants us to stay in restrictions forever', I'd like to be aware of it so that I can write them a letter of complaint."
24411,"Someone thanks someone for an insightful, non-Sinophobic comment, and then you charge in with a thoughtless, Sinophobic reply."
24412,Classic.
24413,There’s a big difference between hesitancy over a new vaccine and disbelief in vaccines or the pandemic.
24414,But the nuance in lost in a lot of people.
24415,"Say what you will about their governing style and human rights abuses, but the Israelis do get their shit together and protect their own."
24416,I wish the US would do the same...
24417,Not all people.
24418,Good.
24419,More for us.
24420,"It can take up to 14 days to show symptoms so yes, you must also quarantine just in case."
24421,Everyone just stay home and chill.
24422,"indeed, but that’s why you get a test anyway, just to be safe and for the others around you!"
24423,"It seems as though COVID was seeded worldwide before we were even made aware of the situation in Wuhan in January - and surely this was possible because of the relatively low fatality rate of COVID, with the vast majority of hospitalised patients being elderly."
24424,"If a disease had a fatality rate much higher (SARS level, for example), surely we would detect the disease at a much earlier point in the epidemic - if a young healthy person shows up critically unwell at hospital, I’m sure more investigation will be done to find the underlying cause than someone who is otherwise very frail."
24425,"To overcome this, In order for a more deadly disease to spread worldwide, would it not likely have to be much more infectious than COVID too?"
24426,"I’m curious what happens when they suspended it for 12 hours, like they just go to a hospital in another county?"
24427,Or just stop accepting those in need during that time?
24428,I think perhaps you are forgetting the title of this thread.
24429,The focus here is on the under reporting of cases.
24430,"In your mind, that hasn't occurred."
24431,Problematic?
24432,I would say so.
24433,[removed]
24434,"I hate to break it to you, but it’s probably a majority at this point that are fatigued to the point of not giving a shit."
24435,"The idea that being fatigued or anti-lockdown makes you a bit is hilariously absurd, and just makes you look out of touch."
24436,He wasn't arrested.
24437,I don't care what your propoganda headline says.
24438,He was instructed to come to his local police station and sign a document stating that he wouldn't spread rumours.
24439,"Yes, it was diabolical and pathetic behaviour but he was never arrested."
24440,Like i said the truth matters.
24441,Just like he wasn't really a whistleblower in the correct use of the term.
24442,"He saw an internal memo telling staff to be on the lookout for odd respiratory diseases, so he sent a message to a small group of family and friends and warned them about it, he also asked them not to tell anyone, hardly whistleblower actions."
24443,Unfortunately for him someone in the group didn't listen and posted it on a much wider forum.
24444,So if anyone was a whistleblower it should be that person.
24445,"But even so, this was happening at the same time China was informing the WHO, so it's kinda irrelevant."
24446,Dr Li still deserves utmost respect as a medical worker who lost his life but the whole myth surrounding him is just that.
24447,Wishing for a different approach doesn't mean I am an anti-vaxxer.
24448,"However, I have nothing to prove as I stated my opinion above."
24449,Stay safe and healthy and I encourage you to get the vaccine when available!
24450,Sad but probably true.
24451,Someone they personally know will have to die for it to be real to them.
24452,Denial is a hell of a drug.
24453,"&gt; We aren't vaccinating children less than 16 years old (or 18 for Moderna), nor do we need to since people under 16 have a negligible chance of complications from this virus anyway."
24454,"So, they can be removed from the 330 million target."
24455,"Well, we aren't yet."
24456,"Pfizer is pursuing authorization for children, I believe as young as 12, so that number will change slightly."
24457,"Children are indeed carriers (even if not as effective as adults), so we can't discount them entirely."
24458,I'm not sure what the under 12 population is in the US.
24459,Is it 30% of 330 million?
24460,&gt; A non-0 number (about 20 million) of people have already had the virus and will contribute towards herd immunity.
24461,"Yes, we know this - reinfections are negligible."
24462,"That's less than 10% of the total, but certainly rising."
24463,We'll have to see if reinfection rate goes up over time.
24464,We're clearly all armchair quarterbacking here.

24466,"The faster we can get it out there, the faster we can get back to normal."
24467,"Regardless of how many people get vaccinated, we're going to again use hospitalization and death rates to help guide us to shut down or open up again."
24468,My entire point is that 22 million a month is a goal that gets us at herd immunity in a year.
24469,2 million a month keeps us in triage mode for the foreseeable future.
24470,Arguing about 80% of 330 million should be 80% of 250 million or whatever is not constructive until we get data on more of the population.
24471,"If we get 50 million or 100 million vaccinated, this whole situation is going to be a lot more clear."

24477,"“Frankly, I’m not going to trust the federal government’s opinion,” Cuomo said."
24478,"“New York state will have its own review when the federal government is finished with their review and says it’s safe.”

It was all politics."
24479,Coumo was more concerned about Trump losing an election than the vaccine.
24480,Since Election Day he has changed his tune as your link shows.
24481,New York never did their review.

24483,"Its a well known magazine in Brazil, this info was replicated in other respectable media companies too"
24484,"One one hand, Turkey and UAE have reported numbers like 90+% and 85+% respectively."
24485,"Brazil on the other hand, is reporting ""better than 50%"", which could mean a bunch of things."
24486,Which countries are more credible?
24487,I strongly disagree with this viewpoint.
24488,We should not just start handing it out; we're still in the early stages of distribution.
24489,We should be innoculating high risk people still to drive down the death rate and therefore threat to our society.
24490,For those higher risk people getting COVID immunity can literally be a matter of life and death.
24491,"Don't get me wrong, I want that jab _bad_ like a lot of others and you probably do too."
24492,"But I definitely do not want to ""take"" someone else's jab when they need it much much more than I do."
24493,"Lastly, I do agree that it's logistically more complicated, and therefore slower, to be cherry picking who gets the doses, but the cost is well worth the reward."
24494,Ready to be downvoted by this CCP infested sub.
24495,I feel like for those worried about herd immunity percentages being crept upwards by officials: That isn’t an important number to focus on... A much more appropriate number to focus on is the percentage vaccinated and how it relates to the elderly.
24496,This will change the characteristics of the virus and we can start going and doing stuff without any large burden.
24497,In the U.S. about 1/7 (14%) of our population is over 65.
24498,"That’s 54,000,000 about."
24499,"Don’t let anyone try to shift the goal posts without solid reasoning, the doctors you see on TV think I’m what is best from a medical perspective, not a social perspective."
24500,"Honestly, could be several, especially in Europe."
24501,I know the meme is that only the USA is struggling with this but that's simply not true.
24502,"That's a great idea, thank you."
24503,"I was able to push my appointment to next week, but I'll submit this idea to the office."
24504,There are medical reasons why many cannot be vaccinated 😷
24505,"and if you look at the percentage of completeness per community, I'm sure we will find that the politicians that let this get so bad are closer to 100% than any other group."
24506,Only the stupid people will take that vaccine.

24508,It's weeding out the weak.

24510,"I feel like by the time a vaccinepass would work because most people are vaccinated and there are surplus doses sitting by and antivaxxers refusing them, the pandemic will largely be over and  no one will give a shit about a vaccinepass by that time."
24511,are you expecting more?
24512,Here’s a wild way to look at it.
24513,"Once old and at risk people are safe, our hospital stress will plummet to almost nothing."
24514,"At that point, isn’t almost every new infection just essentially a natural vaccine?"
24515,"Obviously they should still get a vaccine when the chance arises, but if we eliminate the at risk group, each new infection is one closer to herd immunity."
24516,"Concluding Paragraph:

 Vitamin D deficiency is a widespread situation, affecting from cardiovascular-related conditions to endothelial function and the immune system."
24517,"\[[12](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1109966620302840#bib12)\] In our pilot, single-centre, limited sample size study, we were able to demonstrate that vitamin D deficiency was associated with reduced numbers of natural killer cells; specifically, vitamin D deficient patients presented with mild NK lymphopenia (&lt;100 cells/μl), while vitamin D insufficient patients had normal NK cell counts (&gt;100 cells/μl)."
24518,This reported lymphopenia may obstruct the important cellular barrier during early viral infections in patients with vitamin D deficiency.
24519,A larger cohort of COVID-19 patients to study the correlation between vitamin D deficiency and NK lymphopenia and activation is required.
24520,"True, SARS-CoV-2 has a winning formula with moderate fatality and high transmissibility."
24521,Looks like it's doing more winning with the new highly transmittable variant in the UK.
24522,Many frontline healthcare workers haven’t even gotten theirs.
24523,Administrators have been vaccinating themselves and taking the vaccines away from actual frontline staff.
24524,See Stanford protests and Louisville.
24525,This is the tip of the iceberg it is happening all around the country.

24542,"Yeah, you'd think that, wouldn't you?"
24543,"I certainly would, but look at [quotes from epidemiologists](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/12/04/upshot/epidemiologists-virus-survey-.html) where they imply that we will only go back to something even remotely resembling normal once at least 80% of the population has been vaccinated."
24544,Public health officials have been pushing the idea that naturally-acquired immunity isn't as reliable in preventing recurrent illness as vaccination is.
24545,Are they correct?
24546,"Maybe, and I wish I could still trust them, but it's hard to know who to believe when the most prominent and revered public health official in the country (really the world) is an admitted serial liar."
24547,"So when they called it ""Operation Warp Speed"", what they meant was the transwarp drive on the Excelsior in that one scene from Star Trek III."

You can't stay home all the time cause you'll get even more sick from not getting enough sunlight."
24556,You need vitamin D in your system and you also need to see people to have a good life.
24557,I go for walks every day and don't do stupid pick up from Walmart cause I'd rather go inside cause I like seeing human beings...
24558,It calms me just like it calms most people.
24559,But it also pisses me off when I see people take their mask off or chin mask it in walmart cause it could get me sick or my parents sick...
24560,Even if they never go into Walmart someone is picking up their groceries and those people could get my parents sick.
24561,There's no avoiding that.
24562,I love how you guys think that you can just avoid people... You can't.
24563,Every day you have to eat and that food has to come from somewhere.
24564,Unless I somehow have my own farm I'm gonna have to go out to get food and there's gonna be interactions with humans even if I don't want there to be.
24565,If one of those humans went to church or a party I have a chance to get sick.
24566,So get off your high horse and realize that it's not an option to just sanitize and stay at home and away from your neighbors...
24567,There's a chance to get sick and I don't want to kill my parents.
24568,If you don't care about your parents go party and then come home and give the virus to them cause it seems like that's what you want to do.
24569,I'd rather call the cops on people that party instead of getting people sick.
24570,If you're safely partying outside with distance it's fine but don't party inside at all... Like I'm not going crazy over it...
24571,I walk with a friend every day but we wear masks and we don't go inside and chill without masks on.
24572,We go for walks outside with our masks on and that's fine.

24578,Obviously the small population is a huge advantage.

24589,"They do it, but none of them seem to really like it."
24590,Every person has their price.
24591,"Pay me $1,000,000 per year and I'll most to the middle of North Dakota right now."
24592,The problem is you may get me for two or three years and I'm going to bail because even with a mountain of cash I'll be miserable.
24593,Rural America is not for me at all.
24594,As I said I don't know medicine so I'm judging doctors by new STEM grad standards but here we are reading an article from a very reliable source of news talking about how rural medicine is having a tough time recruiting and retaining doctors even with offering them boatloads of cash.
24595,That says something huge.
24596,Educated young people have a mindset that is not compatible with rural America.
24597,Why are you already thinking that the AstraZeneca/Oxford won't be avaiable anytime soon?
24598,And how do you think the UK will reach herd immunity by April without the Oxford vaccine?
24599,"I fully support masks, but I’m saying you’d have to go to that extent."
24600,"Alameda County in California has been under mask mandate since late May; however, a lot of East Oakland residents haven’t been following mask mandates."
24601,"There’s a gas station where I pick up food deliveries, and people come in and out without wearing masks; even the staff doesn’t wear them despite having the mask mandate signs up."
24602,And nobody’s gonna snitch or say anything; this one guy threatened to beat up another guy because he told him to back up because he wasn’t wearing a mask.
24603,"My point was, at this point they’d have to seriously crack down on that shit because people aren’t gonna listen just because masks are/would be mandatory by law."

24606,"...

""before the year is out, we’ll be able to administer a vaccine to tens of millions of Americans, as you’ve said Mr. President,...""

I guess we'll just have to agree to disagree that the White House directly presented this goal."
24607,To think a studio or production company is actually going to give the power of shutting down production to the PA that was unlucky enough to be in the room when they needed to appoint a COVID risk manager is insane.
24608,"Some studios are taking precautions, others are looking at the bottom line."
24609,"LA is at 0% ICU capacity, so maybe the set builders could start building some ICU's on the studio lots?"
24610,Lots of people still do it.

Currently, vaccines are available to those who are in Category 1A which includes paid and unpaid persons serving in health care settings who have the potential for direct or indirect exposure to patients or infectious materials and long-term care residents and staff."
24631,"Once vaccine availability expands, those in Category 1B will begin receiving vaccines."
24632,Individuals who fall into Category 1B include persons 75 years and older as well as frontline essential workers who are in sectors essential to the functioning of society and are at a substantially higher risk of exposure to COVID-19.

24665,Faucci was just quoted as saying 85% a day ago.
24666,The Australian vaccine was not MRNA based.
24667,They literally were using a small part of an HIV protein in their vaccine and that was causing the users to generate HIV antibodies that could be detected in HIV tests.

24746,My sense (hope) is that at least some of this delay is due to the extreme restrictions on who is allowed to have one.
24747,"Working with thousands of hospital networks and nursing homes around the country to figure out what they need, if they can store it, and then getting it out to them is complex."
24748,"Whereas if you just turn 20m doses over to the largest pharmacy chains that do flu shots every year, you could get them out the door really quickly."
24749,Interesting thought.
24750,You have any evidence that this is even considered though?
24751,And here it is.
24752,"First it was “vaccination won’t mean we will need to stop social distancing and wearing masks” 

Which is a warm up for “lack of masking and social distancing is what caused the Covid pandemic to begin with."

24766,That is good to hear.

24775,"The only clear thing is hospital workers, but lots are passing saying that they want to wait."
24776,One of the biggest shocks I saw was that people with only asthma are not in the first three groups eligible (atleast in MA).

24795,"Sorry for the really long post, but this has been driving me nuts for the last few days, and I need to at least get my thoughts on this down somewhere people can see them."
24796,I’ve been thinking and thinking about this now-infamous Fauci quote on raising his estimate for herd immunity.
24797,"If you haven’t read [the NYT article](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/12/24/health/herd-immunity-covid-coronavirus.html) where he says this, I’d encourage you to read the whole thing, but the specific quote I’m referring to is:

&gt;“When polls said only about half of all Americans would take a vaccine, I was saying herd immunity would take 70 to 75 percent,” Dr. Fauci said."
24798,"“Then, when newer surveys said 60 percent or more would take it, I thought, ‘I can nudge this up a bit,’ so I went to 80, 85.”

Lots of people have already written about how unsettling it is that Fauci not only deceived the public, but admitted to it."
24799,"For me, the strangest aspect of that quote is his rationale, or lack thereof."
24800,"I’d be willing to at least entertain the notion that the ends justified his means, if he could simply explain why he feels he’s been doing the right thing."
24801,"His explanations in that NYT article, as well as in [recent media appearances](https://www.cnn.com/videos/health/2020/12/27/fauci-coronavirus-herd-immunity-range-estimate-shift-intv-sotu-vpx.cnn) where he’s been questioned about that quote, have been vague and contradictory."
24802,So let’s try and look at it from his perspective.
24803,Why would he want to increase his estimate of the percentage needed for herd immunity as the percentage of likely vaccine takers increased?
24804,"I’ve racked my brain trying to parse his logic here, and I think I’ve figured it out."
24805,"Maybe this explanation will seem obvious to some people, idk."
24806,"But in case it isn’t, let’s examine two possible scenarios for late 2021."
24807,Scenario A: 50% of Americans have received a Covid vaccine.
24808,"Fauci goes on TV and explains that we need to keep stringent social distancing and mask restrictions in place, because we haven’t achieved herd immunity, which would require 70%."
24809,Scenario B: 70% of Americans have received a Covid vaccine.
24810,"Fauci goes on TV and explains that we need to keep stringent social distancing and mask restrictions in place, because we haven’t achieved herd immunity, which would require 85%."
24811,See what I’m getting at?
24812,Raising the herd immunity estimate provides a way for Fauci (and other public health officials) to keep pushing for tougher restrictions.
24813,"The herd immunity estimate stays 15 - 20% higher than the percentage of people who are immune, and restaurants stay shut down, masks stay on, etc."
24814,I am not a denier or conspiracy theorist.
24815,"For one thing, I’m 100% pro-vaccine."
24816,"I also absolutely understand why social distancing and masks are necessary right now, with the horrific death rates we’re seeing."
24817,I’m willing to say that Fauci and other public health officials have the best intentions.
24818,"They want to save as many lives as possible from Covid, and of course keeping stringent restrictions for many more years will do that."
24819,"But to go about it in this sneaky, psychologically manipulative way?"
24820,"Is that really justified, particularly given the possibility it might sow distrust in public health officials?"
24821,"We need to be asking these questions, and also asking if it really is worth keeping Covid restrictions after everyone who’s willing to get the vaccine has gotten it."
24822,"tl;dr Fauci is gonna keep raising his herd immunity estimate so that we’re always below it, and can never go back to normal"
24823,"Viruses have a certain nature where the more easily communicable and contagious they are, the less dangerous and deadly they are."
24824,"Covid is just like all the other flu and common cold type viruses in that it is extremely contagious, but has an extremely low IFR, with the vast majority of people who contract it having mild or no symptoms."
24825,"The fact that for every case that gets recorded, there are ten more is actually a great thing because 1."
24826,It shows how mild this virus is that the vast majority of people don't even really get sick from contracting it .
24827,2.It shows the IFR is extremely low...and along the lines of the annual flu.
24828,"If a billion people get a respiratory virus (the WHO actually estimated that close to a billion people worldide have already been infected), and only a million of them die, that shows what it is a highly contagious but mild virus."
24829,Valid observation.
24830,"But I was commenting on the actual comments of how countries are reacting 😂

But yes when you put it as 10 months...not that quick ha"
24831,Then they cite one news article about some random 25 year old who had terrible after effects.
24832,When the only reason that it is news is because most young people who get the virus are completely fucking fine.
24833,We realistically only need to vaccinate the elderly to get the pandemic down to “not a big deal” levels.
24834,The pandemic is only 1 year old... let it grow a few more years before jumping to conclusions
24835,You'll live

24842,👏🏻
24843,Unfortunately we aren't America where we have the choice about the luxury of wearing a mask - for the sake of our economy we have to start controlling the spread of this very real virus or face almost certain economic ruin.
24844,"&gt;I hope that after we get back to some semblance of normality after this, we realize something worse is headed our way."

24856,It has not been a pleasant experience.
24857,Psyche patients with COVID are not the easiest to deal with in terms of making sure they keep their masks on and stuff.
24858,She had a couple co-workers test positive but thank God she never got it.
24859,I can see some light at the end of the tunnel finally.
24860,That’s not what this article says at all
24861,A matter of about 10 months.
24862,You mean America?
24863,Then what’s with the consistent negativity?
24864,Gulag

24869,"If you walk into almost any Walmart or gas station in the rural US you will be hard pressed to spot even half of the customers wearing a mask or if they are, their nose is liable to be sticking out of it."
24870,I’ve seen it myself.
24871,This isn’t some political rhetoric.
24872,"And when those antibodies studies came out, everyone insisted we don't listen to them because the tests may have been unreliable."
24873,"Shocking isn't it, such a simple measure."
24874,Yes it's inconvenient but it's effective.
24875,"Most countries that have s handle on it, Taiwan, Korea New Zealand, Australia they all do the same."
24876,I'm from England originally and i can't believe how little they've done to curb the influx.
24877,i AM looking at the graphs.
24878,"i see 1000+ deaths in one day, then two after that until this day."
24879,how would *you* explain the brick-walling of death numbers?
24880,did corona just stop killing people?
24881,seems like number fudging to me.
24882,Just finished.
24883,It's a nice change from 30 second articles with misleading click bait titles.
24884,Happy holidays
24885,Its about money.
24886,"If you have enough money, you can run several tests at once, even if outcome of one depends on another, you are just risking losing much more."
24887,Also the notion that other vaccines wait to see long term effects is wrong.
24888,"They are out after the tests, same tests that covid vaccines gone through, so they can make profit asap."
24889,Stop making excuses...

24904,Impulse engine speed.
24905,That and a lot of states teachers are still having to teach and are terrified of getting sick or bringing it home to their families.

24911,Doses are going to go bad while states sit on their hands figuring out who to give vaccine to.
24912,"But they won't die of Covid, so its a win"
24913,"Or it indicates somebody isn't telling the truth, to put it mildly."
24914,One that bars people from care.
24915,"'I want to clear my name, you know it was just a moral boost'...He really said that?"
24916,"how twisted these guys are..

24917,"people tend to look at the idiots that fill the GOP and imagine they're the driving force behind the party but you've got to remember that there are a lot of billionaires who can literally spend tens of millions to hire top graduates from all the best universities psychology, marketing and media courses, can dictate terms to entire countries just based on their ability to choose the location of manufacturing facilities or suppliers, and who are deeply connected to organised crime and corruption on an international level."
24918,Honestly the fact that society hasn't completely crumbled under these pressures shows amazing resilience.
24919,"The slower the vaccinations are, the more people will unnecessarily die and the slower it will take for the economy to recover."
24920,11 million vaccines have been allocated to the States as of yesterday.
24921,It's just that our data only shows 2 million people having actually received the vaccine.
24922,"Sure, it's not our goal, but it's still pretty damn good considering production just started."
24923,It’s very unwise to start seeing enemies in the people who are actually trying to help.
24924,No one is perfect and this pandemic is a changing landscape.
24925,Even the CDC was saying at the start that masks didn’t help.
24926,They were wrong and they updated their guidelines to reflect that new understanding.
24927,Let’s move on.
24928,Yes you are for being a selfish asshole Trumpty!
24929,!
24930,"Lol, yes, some people do still do this."
24931,"I probably wouldn't have subscribed, but it's free and just shows up on our doorstep every week."
24932,Yeah honestly I'm not too concerned if we have the vaccines and just haven't given them out yet.
24933,It would be a lot more concerning if only 2M doses were manufactured.
24934,100% agree
24935,Honestly your quote sounds like every scientific paper ever when they don’t want to overstate the evidence they have.
24936,If they had gone the other way and said that it transmitted easily and it turned out that it didn’t then they would be accused of fear-mongering.
24937,I would take 6 months of authoritarianism over 20 more years of COVID and / or being dead
24938,They dont want another lockdown situation....All of that staying home and ordering in and delivery and decontamination....Gotta do it.
24939,But yes its really a chore.
24940,You need to look at the graphs more closely.
24941,"Deaths were slowing along with cases through march, since their last deaths back in April they've had 4000 or so cases, mostly imported, so mostly health people."
24942,How many deaths per 4 thousand healthy people would you expect.
24943,And that whole welding people into their apartment is so tired.
24944,"Many of the videos of entranceways being welded closed were entirely that, just entranceways, most places have multiple entrances and they were trying to funnel people to only enter 1 way, so temperature checks could be made."
24945,"There were a few people that got welded into their apartment, these were persistent quarantine breakers."
24946,"Personally screw them, many countries put such people in prison."
24947,Where would you rather be?
24948,"Also as it happens once the authorities found out, they were released and those that did it were reprimanded."
24949,"They signed a deal back in July, that likely gave them priority in terms of getting doses faster than some other countries."
24950,"Also, they are being very quick at vaccinating their population."
24951,Its the morons that read a comment then transform it into a strawman that's screwing this up for everyone.
24952,And then they complain!
24953,Here in the Netherlands not a single vaccine will be given this year.
24954,We're the slowest of Europe.
24955,Shameful really.
24956,I really hope we catch-up early in '21.
24957,Tell them Castro invented covid
24958,we have a net?
24959,Magically everyone is on their Facebook groups making fake cards relating to what they think HIPAA is to get out of wearing them.
24960,Also some of these unemployment systems weren't designed to handle the load of so many people filing for unemployment all at once.
24961,"My wife had an issue with her unemployment (some sort of glitch, we think related to confusion about how to report Memorial Day holiday) and the online system wouldn't let her certify anymore) and couldn't get through to the unemployment office for months."
24962,"Wasn't just us, quite a few news articles came out about it, here's an example: https://chicago.cbslocal.com/2020/06/11/some-illinoisans-are-now-back-at-work-but-still-cant-get-through-to-secure-unemployment-theyve-been-trying-to-get-since-march/"
24963,Fatness doesn't necessarily speak to availability of nutritious and decent food.
24964,Remember a lot of homeless people sustain themselves on fast food scraps.
24965,And fast food is by definition horrific for your health.
24966,I'd also be very curious to meet and overweight homeless person.
24967,Most of the ones I see in my major US city are extremely thin
24968,I have my fingers crossed.
24969,I plan to get the vaccine.
24970,"Beats getting actual covid and gambling with how my body would respond to that, definitely."
24971,"I doubt the bubonic plague would even be capable of spreading very far with our modern sanitation system and understanding of medicine, even without antibiotics."
24972,"Even if it could, I have a feeling that the literal black death coming back would make even the most staunch anti-maskers stay home."
24973,"Already heard about the mass exodus of people moving away to Texas, etc."
24974,A tragic outlier.
24975,Relative risk from type 1 diabetes is 150% of that of someone without type 1.
24976,"At 26, the IFR for someone without diabetes is around 0.002%."
24977,A 50% increase puts that risk up to lower than that of the healthy under 40 year old population.
24978,Lockdowns are all about public optics and squeamishness about what has been done during every single global pandemic in the history of healthcare.
24979,Match extant resource with requirement through the process of triage.
24980,Which was exactly what was agreed in the U.K. 2015 pandemic planning exercise.
24981,Governments decided to go off script once mass public hysteria was caused by reckless edits reporting.
24982,"The WHO and SAGE have both said this is an endemic virus and isn’t going anywhere anytime soon and mindful that coronavirus has only accounted for 2.5% of deaths globally, quite frankly what governments have done is reckless in the extreme."
24983,Because some of us live alone in small flats and haven't been able to see our friends and family since March?
24984,Maybe that's what makes it a big deal?
24985,"No fucking empathy on this sub, Jesus."
24986,That’s not all we have... this is a willfully ignorant position
24987,"As someone that just came through the quarantine process in China, I'm wondering why other countries still aren't doing more."
24988,"Israel is apparently going into lock down specifically for vaccine distribution, and giving shots 24/7."
24989,"I expect that by the end of year, we're gonna be done asking people."
24990,The current vaccine race is literally do or die and if we dont hit herd immunity in time (which we almost certainly won't) then we're gonna find ourselves on a whole new chess board.
24991,"Triage will become a thing, and the people who don't want to comply now are not going to wake up."
24992,They're not gonna suddenly start giving a shit.
24993,We'll have to twist their arm and ply them with things like laws and fines.
24994,"Democracy is great for just about everything except pandemic response, and the fact that so many millions of Americans are willing to sacrifice the lives of people around them right now just to theoretically safeguard liberties and rights that *might* get taken away down the road is horrifying."
24995,"Even if those people are right, it changes nothing."
24996,Personal liberties dont mean jack shit if were all *dead*.
24997,"Weve been living in a cushy, relatively peaceful 80 years since WW2, the last truly major global conflict, and because of that we just have no ability to look ahead, to prioritize, to understand that we put this fire out first and then we deal with with courtroom battles pertaining to personal liberties after the fact."
24998,People are trying to have it both ways right now and that's why this situation is continuing to get worse
24999,"If Biden follows the science like he says he will, hopefully ivermectin is pushed day 1."
25000,"It's okay, at least all the anti-mask, COVID denying republiklan congressmen got vaccinated."
25001,Idk why this article is limited to just planes.
25002,They test positive and go everywhere with the rationalization “everyone’s gonna get it eventually”.
25003,I am so sad that half or more of Texans refuse to be safe.
25004,Your comment has LITERALLY 3 emergency medicine physicians replying about how their facilities and regions are at saturation...yet all around these science denying idiots are going maskless and living like everything is A-OK...
25005,I pray that my family doesn’t require any unexpected medical care.
25006,sad state of affairs in Texas &amp; this country
25007,Instead of mailing masks to everyone mail ivermectin
25008,"Uh, your maths is waaaay off."
25009,"271/120,075 = 0.0022 or 0.2%."
25010,"You’ve calculated 1/120,075 = 0.0000843709 for starters."
25011,And then also forgot to multiply by 100 when reporting it as a percent.
25012,"Sir, thats communism."
25013,...wtf does that comment add to anything?
25014,Leave the waitress 2 cents then send the restaurant owner a cool mill for all his hard work.
25015,"Pfizer originally said they'd have 100 million doses by year-end, then revised to 50 million and now 40 million."
25016,But that is still a lot considering only 2 million have been given so there should be 35 million or so doses available in a few days.
25017,In my area they've gotten it down to 24 hours for the test..
25018,AZ hasn't submitted data to the EMA - the trial data shows high levels of efficacy and safety - hence why the MHRA will approve it in the next day or so.
25019,You don’t deserve to be treated if you choose not to get the vaccine.
25020,Putting the rest of the population at risk because of your own weaponized stupidity should have consequences.
25021,"According to him, to protect stocks of PPE for medical workers from having the public buy up all the supplies."
25022,But now we know that people could've made masks out of old tshirts or socks or damn near anything.
25023,"Instead, he said there was no need for people to be walking around wearing masks."
25024,"His intent may have been good, and the lie may have even been justified, but he still lied."
25025,No he's just talking out his ass.
25026,Recent news suggests approval of the Oxford vaccine is close in both India and the UK.
25027,"As for using ""their manufacturing capability"", they are completely different vaccine types (mRNA vs viral)."
25028,2/3rds of spanish flu deaths were from secondary bacterial infections.
25029,"You might say that's not a ""direct impact"" of the virus but it's really splitting hairs at that point."
25030,i doubt we're in the hundred millions already
25031,Tell that to then officers i passed today not wearing a mask at the mall.
25032,"I dislike this law for the main reason of how biased it can be, it reminds me of school where boys aren’t allowed to have long hair, every other person has a different view of what is okay

Am I breaking the law i take off my mask before climbing into my car even though im next to the open car door, some would say yes, others would lol no

Am i now breaking the law if i am drinking my coffee outside with no mask..."
25033,&gt;	The whole world wears masks... the virus is super contagious and spreading rapidly anyway.
25034,Except the whole world *isn’t wearing masks* and that’s a major component of the problems we’re facing.
25035,People are refusing to comply with simple guidelines and its exacerbating the problems that our healthcare sector is facing.
25036,People won’t even stay the fuck home over holidays because seeing their loved ones is somehow more important than other human beings not getting sick.

25038,This is where the US government dropped the ball.
25039,"We needed a massive push at the beginning to keep people fed, housed, and protected from hardship."
25040,No one living in the US should have to worry about this stuff when a pandemic hits and lockdowns are deemed necessary.
25041,"But our country, historically, has dropped the ball any time it comes to protecting the people unless it involves bombs and guns."
25042,It’s shameful.
25043,Two more serious viruses with far less global interconnection.
25044,"Imagine smallpox today — on planes, ships, trade goods."
25045,There would be an enormous death toll.
25046,What the fuck did that contribute to anything?
25047," - the big one would be a highly infectious and DEADLY, imagine bubonic plaque/ebola where death rates are astronomical, hitting 90% of those infected."
25048,- COVID is not the BIG one.
25049,We see the massive failure in the US from NO leadership as part of a political strategy to weaponize a pandemic against political opposition of democratic states and cities
25050,your government is lying to you about your risk of getting a deadly virus and you don't care?

25066,You’re wrong.

25078,"Pfizer was saying they'd have 50 million doses manufactured by year-end (originally 100 million, now I guess revised to 40 million)."
25079,Catalent (one of the companies manufacturing the Moderna vaccine) said a couple of weeks ago they were ramping from 500k to 1M doses per day.
25080,The mRNA vaccines are easier to manufacture because they don't require growing live cultures like eggs or plants like some traditional vaccines so they should be able to ramp pretty quickly.
25081,At this stage it looks like manufacturing is exceeding distribution and jabs.

25091,"Here, try this Sputnik vaccine...it *should* work."
25092,"While you are correct, to vaccinate half would require 11 million per month."
25093,The problem is they were terribly wrong and their caution turned out to be disastrous.

By Le Nga
Tue 12/29/2020, 07:43 pm (GMT+7)

A man and a woman illegally returning to Vietnam last week have taken the nation’s Covid-19 active case count to 97."
25220,"Two officers guard the area where a man, who illegally entered Vietnam and is now confirmed a Covid-19 patient, lives in Ho Chi Minh City's District 9, December 29, 2020."
25221,Photo by VnExpress/Dinh Van.
25222,Patients 1452 and 1453 are part of a group of six who crossed a border illegally to enter Vietnam last week.
25223,The six had traveled from Myanmar to Thailand on Dec. 15 and to Cambodia on Dec. 23.
25224,"On Dec. 24, they got into Vietnam by boat across the Binh Di River that runs between Cambodia and Vietnam, and were picked up by a car."
25225,"After entering Vietnam, a 31-year-old woman, ""patient 1452,"" went to the Mekong Delta province of Dong Thap while the 23-year-old man, ""patient 1453"" went to Ho Chi Minh City's District 9 to work at a mechanical factory in Long Binh Ward."
25226,"Of the other four, one 32-year-old man returned to his home in the Mekong Delta province of Vinh Long and the rest traveled to HCMC."
25227,"The Vinh Long man was confirmed as ""patient 1440"" last Saturday after his family turned him in for quarantining, which is mandated under a protocol that applies to everyone arriving in Vietnam from abroad."
25228,"From the case of ""patient 1440,"" health authorities tracked down all who’d come into close contact with him and found the other five illegal entrants."
25229,"A 23-year-old man in HCMC's District 5 was confirmed as ""patient 1451"" on Monday."
25230,"With the two latest cases, four people in this group have been diagnosed with Covid-19."
25231,The other two have been quarantined and have so far tested negative.
25232,The driver who picked them up at the border has also tested negative.
25233,"Also Tuesday evening, the health ministry confirmed another Covid-19 case, an eight-year-old girl landing December 27 at HCMC’s Tan Son Nhat Airport from the U.S.
Vietnam’s current Covid-19 tally stands at 1,454 with 1,319 recoveries and 35 deaths."
25234,It has gone 27 days without community transmissions.
25235,"Authorities have taken drastic measures to trace all those who’ve come into close contact with the illegal entrants who’ve made up the latest Covid-19 cases."""
25236,80% of fatalities are in about 15% of the population.
25237,Once we vaccinate about 80% of that 15% the fatality rate will be so small it will be hard to measure.
25238,This has bugged me so much since this all started.
25239,"If you need to take your mask off, take it off."
25240,"Don't pull it down, stretch out the ear loops, and get those neck germs on the inside of your mask."
25241,I work in a hospital and everyone does this.
25242,It is infuriating.
25243,Good luck to you
25244,That's not even what the death chart shows.
25245,"They reported a backlog of 1000 deaths in April, otherwise the death chart looks completely as you'd expect."
25246,There is no chance of Sputnik being approved in the EU or USA.
25247,Zero.
25248,"Maybe it's morbid, but I'm just hoping that another pandemic waits for my older loved ones to be gone before hitting."
25249,This would have been a lot less stressful of a year if I were alone.
25250,Because you are the ultimate judge of morality.
25251,Lmao could you imagine the gaffs in a fireside chat?
25252,Dude could barely speak with a teleprompter
25253,About half of the population takes flu shots over a period of about 3 months which is about 50 million shots per month or about 1.5 million per day.
25254,Pfizer is on track to manufacture 50 million doses by year end.
25255,Wide scale vaccination can certainly be done in less than a year.
25256,The typical response of someone who can't respond to the arguments being put forth.
25257,Bout damn time; The US needs this.
25258,Good.
25259,"So you acknowledge that we have more than unrepeatable, uncontrolled, garbage data from different regions....

What you’re doing is called goal post shifting."
25260,Wear your mask son.
25261,"sure, that could have happened."
25262,its atleast something that could plausibly be true.
25263,it still doesnt explain why the deaths completely stop after that.
25264,"I hope that you are calling for massive societal changes to prevent climate change with the same fervor, since that is causing a large amount of suicides as well."
25265,And probably a lot of the young people killing themselves over the last year are ones who know that the world is not going to get better from climate change because of all the people throwing hissy fits over wearing a mask.
25266,You think people are going to do what needs to be done to avert the disasters heading our ways?
25267,I don't blame anyone killing themselves right now.
25268,The future is bleak and it's made worse by the people demanding that they can go out and kill others because they don't want to be inconvenienced by not getting a haircut or not being able to make service employees wait on them for a year.
25269,"Even though aerosol transmission is lower outside, pretty sure unmitigated droplet transmission could still easily happen"
25270,Not true at all you just talking out your ass.
25271,"People all other Asia, and in Korea lived like the whole world did without masks to act like masks were normal pre-covid is false."
25272,There's always a fucking problem here.
25273,He’s right though.
25274,"Once the vulnerable are vaccinated, any remaining political impetus or desire for restrictions will be gone."
25275,"By June, America will be by-and-large back to normal."
25276,"I’m not saying this is the right thing to do, but it is almost certainly what will happen"

25279,"We aren't vaccinating children less than 16 years old (or 18 for Moderna), nor do we need to since people under 16 have a negligible chance of complications from this virus anyway."
25280,"So, they can be removed from the 330 million target."
25281,2.
25282,A non-0 number (about 20 million) of people have already had the virus and will contribute towards herd immunity.
25283,"Yes, we know this - reinfections are negligible."
25284,"I'm reading a book on the Black Death at the moment, and it is terrifying."
25285,I can't imagine half the people in Europe dying over the span of a few years.
25286,"He’s making a joke about OP’s typo:

OP’s comment originally had 300,000,000 million, (three hundred million million), while this comment compared it to earth’s population at 6,115 million (six thousand million, or six billion)."
25287,She’s got her coronavirus sweater on.
25288,":) 
Good work Margaret Keenan, stay safe."
25289,"I doubt this is a significant probability unless you are in a very high risk area, but it could be a good scare tactic for the idiots who feel the need to constantly drop their masks indoors."
25290,I don't think it matters much outdoors unless the area is packed with people and people are often doing harder physical labor.
25291,"Those people should wear masks when close, but if they need to drop the mask and take a little mask break away from others that should be fine."
25292,Unless someone sneezed on your face and neck you don't have much chance of your neck having viral particles on it.
25293,"If you are that coated with virus particles, you are doing something wrong."
25294,"Either you aren't washing your hands much OR you are in an extremely high viral particle area, in which case you need suit.. so your whole body and all your clothes are not coated also."
25295,PLUS you can easily wash your neck like you wash your hands.
25296,Tbf our guard has been down since the summer.
25297,"now that i think about it, i’ve never had an adverse reaction to a vaccine except for soreness in the area"
25298,Damn what happens to her if she gets the actual flu?
25299,The virus' only goal is to replicate.
25300,It doesnt give a shit about how damaging that is to its host.
25301,"It infects anything it can, human, bat, pangola, cat, bird, pig, any animal that it gets into and can replicate in."
25302,Once you've (successfully) fought off the virus then it's dead.
25303,If you die then its dead.
25304,Neither outcome is beneficial.
25305,"Ideally you would be very sick for a long time, thats a much better outcome for thr lle virus."
25306,"Normally the more obviously infectious a disease is, the less likely someone is to continue spreading it (if you're too sick to get out of bed, you probs wont be infecting anyone)."
25307,"This wont stop mutations being more deadly, but MAY influence their future transmission."
25308,"However with half the world seemingly not giving a shit, maybe human behaviour wont change regsrdless of the virus evolution."
25309,So the virus will evolve whatever is most effective and transmitting it longer and to a wider audience.
25310,"If human behaviour enables a deadlier variant, then thats what it will take."
25311,The viruses evolution is shaped by the human response to it.
25312,Who cares?
25313,If 40% of the population wants to risk it then that’s on them.
25314,The other 60% can’t rest easy knowing they’re not fucking idiots.
25315,I feel like it's gotta be higher than that because we did 1.5m Christmas week and 38 states just started doing nursing homes yesterday
25316,The mods should ban articles from marketwatch.com.
25317,I think that only applies to Oslo.
25318,But still awesome that all the care home residents in the worst hit region will be fully vaccinated by mid-January
25319,It'll be interesting to see if the UK approves the vaccine even though the EMA considers that the available data is not sufficient.
25320,"I'm not a Spaniard, but I'm glad to see you leading the way."
25321,I hope this catches on.
25322,"Sorry that isn’t going to help you one bit, COVID pneumonia is viral not bacterial."
25323,https://www.cebm.net/covid-19/differentiating-viral-from-bacterial-pneumonia/
25324,ok. some kind of weird justice then?
25325,You most likely infected others so we will not help you?
25326,Switch 'dude on bike' with 'drunken driver' then.
25327,"Drunken driver hitting a wall, nobody needs to call 911 because, hey, that guy could have killed someone?"
25328,"22yrs old Jimmy overdosed on heroin, yeah, let him die, he bought a couple grams for his friends once, they could have overdosed, ya know."
25329,"Plus, basically every case where indeed some other person was hurt can be discarded."
25330,"4yrs old son hitting his sister with a bobbycar, sister gets care, son not."
25331,ITT no one reads the article
25332,"Good point, if people wouldn't mind stating their age that may give us some feedback on generalizability of their experiences."
25333,"EG if you're 20, you usually have a robust immune system."
25334,Where's my cheque then?
25335,As it should be
25336,[removed]
25337,Same.. haven't heard of this!
25338,We'd have to deal with increased death rates for a while.
25339,"It sucks but even with a vaccine in near-miracle time, they're saying no normal till fall."
25340,"If it had taken a typical amount of time, did you really expect anyone to lock down for 3-4 years?"
25341,"I'd take the 3m deaths, in that scenario."
25342,Sorry.
25343,Probably another million at least
25344,Guilty
25345,Why would\`nt you want to scrub your groceries and relax instead of washing everything separately bevore the consumption?
25346,Takes me probably 20 min to desinfect everything and I am good for another week.
25347,Same goes for protecting your eyes during shopping.
25348,I constantly get shocked looks for wearing mask AND protective googles in store.
25349,This is what you get when you vaccinate millions of people.
25350,Random and totally unrelated events will happen.
25351,"Soon you’ll see reports of “man winning the lottery hours after vaccination”, doesn’t mean becoming a millionaire is one of the side effects."
25352,People who pose a threat to others deserve to have freedoms taken away.
25353,That's why we have prisons.
25354,If you’re talking about positive tests then you’re right.
25355,"If you’re talking about objective reality and taking credit for a huge reduction in testing during Christmas week, you’re dumber than I thought."
25356,"Well, the way Reddit ranks comments sort of gives you an idea of the general sentiment of the population."
25357,&gt;Nonprofit hospitals nationwide can apply now because President Donald Trump declared the pandemic a national emergency in March.
25358,"&gt;For-profit hospitals, which have faced similar challenges from the pandemic, can’t tap the FEMA money because federal law governing disaster relief excludes for-profit businesses."
25359,"&gt;FEMA is reimbursing nonprofit hospitals for money spent on personal protective equipment, ventilators, employee overtime, temporary workers, testing supplies and other expenses covered as “emergency protective measures.” The agency reimburses hospitals for 75% of their eligible costs."
25360,1.
25361,That’s life.
25362,2.
25363,Show me any evidence that the incidence or severity of long covid is not a manifestation of Post Viral Syndrome encounter with other viral infections.
25364,3.
25365,Yep.
25366,"So why are geriatrics allowed to mix with general society, despite facing upwards of 450 times the risk of someone in their working years?"
25367,Does it say only 50%?
25368,Because every other articles just said it passed the minimum 50% without releasing an actual confirmed figure.
25369,we can’t take any chances with the current conspiracy theory climate
25370,"Nobody will wear masks if the virus isn’t a threat, and if the number of people dying is equivalent to flu deaths, people will stop wearing masks."
25371,I'm all for people wearing masks but one could argue that there is a difference between endangering people and not preventing people from getting endangered.
25372,"In a direct sense, It's not them endangering people it's covid, they are just not doing anything to help it."
25373,It's more a thing of social duty in my eyes to wear a mask.
25374,Like neglected support.
25375,I actually find it mindblowing how the government can force people to be good humans.
25376,"Thanks - yes, I was just wondering if those already infected could be taken off the total number of vaccinations to be delivered but it seems not - they will contribute to herd immunity even before vaccination but we still need enough doses to cover them."
25377,How many people do you think the US will vaccinate this week?
25378,I’ll let everyone else find out the side effects and I won’t be some trial animal.
25379,The good news (for us) is that many of us are choosing to leave healthcare.
25380,I’m hoping to get out in a couple years.
25381,Rural hospitals are closing and ICU’s are are at max capacity because of staffing shortages.
25382,"If you or someone you love get in an accident there may not be an open hospitals to stabilize you or a staffed ICU bed to accept you, that means you’d have to have to be transferred out of the state possibly (where I live we’re transferring patients 270 miles away because there are no nurses to staff ICU beds)."
25383,Long transfers often equals dead patients but that’s just the way things go right?
25384,"Oh seriously,this isn't even pretending not to be a sockpuppet."
25385,It’s still going to go past your face before it gets to the filter
25386,I'd be 100% for your plan if they didn't then spread it to everyone else afterward.
25387,"That's great and all, but at what cost?"
25388,What if we were still finding a way to kill this virus with a vaccine?
25389,What if it took a full year to 18 months to even get a vaccine?
25390,Our situation now wouldn't have been any different than it was before election day.
25391,"Well, we never really _know_ anything with 100% certainty."
25392,"However, there are about 20 million confirmed cases in the USA, and only a few reported re-infections (a few can be a couple thousand when we're talking a sample size of 20 million)."
25393,&gt;  I think it’s probably smarter to plan to vaccinate every adult and end up with too much than to bank on the unknown and end up with too little.
25394,I think this is the plan anyway.
25395,"My point is that in the mean time, those who were already infected _will_ contribute towards herd immunity, at least until they can get a vaccine."
25396,Immigration status is also helped by working in an underserved community.
25397,Worked in a rural hospital were most of the doctors were only there out of immigration necessity.
25398,These vaccines require 2 pokes.
25399,You didn’t factor in that it’s 2(330 * .85).
25400,How does it contradict the fact that this publication is worded as if to to make it look that the all-cause mortality statistics was hidden whereas it wasn't the case and the data have always been accessible to everybody?
25401,Loose translation: Hospitals that know how to bill (work the system) and make money succeed.
25402,"After their CEO's big talk, anything less than 95% efficacy will make them look like absolute losers."
25403,I didn’t ask about the sub.
25404,I asked why you personally won’t get the vaccine.
25405,"You’re missing a zero on your billion there fella;

300 million - 300,000,000
6.115 billion -6,115,000,000"
25406,"My working theory is that they're being so specific about who can get it, that it's limiting the amount of doses they can give out so most of the doses are just sitting in storage."
25407,Almost a paralysis through analysis.
25408,"They need to start getting Walgreens, CVS, and Walmart involved and just start injecting people."
25409,Or it's a bullshit article.
25410,I kid you not.
25411,I had a rash under my arm after I got the pneumonia shot for 3 months straight!
25412,Facts
25413,There are extremely few people I know or met who had first hand experience of signing up to WW2.
25414,That was the last time there was a global event with this magnitude of death.
25415,"There have been regional, localised wars, terrorist attacks or civil wars but for 70 years humanity on a global scale hasn't had to face mass death."
25416,My oldest relative at 98 remembers the 1930's with fascism in Europe and the results.
25417,"Everyone else (probably you too) have only knowledge of it through reading, education and films."
25418,"Those in Syria, Iraq and Afgan will know the impact of civil wars or alleged wars of liberation."
25419,"For the rest of the planet, no-one has experienced global wars or mass deaths on every continent since 1945."
25420,What's the closest parallel other than WW2?
25421,"As I said, I can liken it to the feeling of signing up because of the lack of sudden change (I'm not comparing taking a vaccine to suddenly being in the trenches or beaches of northern Europe) but can't compared it because an extremely extremely small fraction of the population have any direct experience."
25422,"The last pandemic of 1918, even the oldest surviver would have been a baby at that time."
25423,I was unblinded and my data will be monitored differently.
25424,I won't be able to be used for their primary end goals but can still be valuable in terms of receiving different vaccines and safety.
25425,I'm able to stay in the trial I just didn't get my 2nd dose of AZ.
25426,"And no, the one month difference likely isn't an issue."
25427,I wouldn’t say x3 but certainly those numbers are under counted
25428,"If you have a lot of people ignoring the situation I think it's completely ok. We are surrounded by anti science people who should be medicated probably, and we let them spread this crap because of their freedom to.. spread disease?"
25429,It's pretty strange choosing priorities which are not human lives.
25430,"And I don't understand Sweden, as far as I can tell they had the worst outcome of all the northern countries, shrinking gdp and such."
25431,Looks like people want to talk about Sweden because they tried to ignore the thing and not because of their good results.
25432,"We should all be talking about New Zealand, Vietnam, Taiwan.."
25433,Places where people actually managed to solve this problem.
25434,So I'd say they are the only ones who aren't complete idiots
25435,moderators should remove this comment for spreading misinformation
25436,I'm reading a book about the Black Death in the 1300s and that shit is terrifying.
25437,Like a third to half of Europe's population died from it!
25438,"There were people writing diaries and journals and saying things like, ""In case there are humans in the future to read this..."""
25439,You can have my spot friend
25440,"Lol, ""the right"" has always been the side that rooted for more control over people, not less."
25441,"This post appears to be about vaccines, please see [our FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/wiki/faq#wiki_where_can_i_find_information_about_the_mechanism_and_progress_of_vaccines.3F) for answers to frequently asked questions regarding the COVID-19 vaccines."

25445,*
25446,If this sub pushes anything you for sure don’t want it.
25447,This sub is full of misinformation but the mods here are some of the worst on Reddit.
25448,This sub even has a fake doctor haha.
25449,A mental doctor lmao
25450,Scariest thing about covis is that you infect your family members.
25451,If it was only about me I would not care at all.
25452,"For real, I think I saw someone comment on another thread that for these first few weeks we should see the amount of vaccines given triple each time and then it will flatten out based on supply (this was before week 2s numbers were in)."
25453,We did 500k then 1.5m and I would assume we should be on track to get 4.5m this week (I hope).
25454,I think we likely will hit this because of Christmas being done and 38 states literally not starting nursing homes until yesterday.
25455,[removed]
25456,"Idk, in terms of raw mortality (number of deaths), I think a virus with a low IFR will wreck more havoc."
25457,"If covid was killing at 50%, I feel like people would have taken it much more seriously."
25458,"When Ebola briefly hit here in the U.S. everyone shit their pants, but it seems like many people don't care about a virus with ~1% IFR, even though we have lost almost 2 million souls."
25459,I was asked.
25460,And I don’t think science is an opinion.
25461,H5N1 is the one that really worries me.
25462,"It spreads readily between birds, and has passed from birds to humans a few times, but no cases have been documented between humans (yet)."
25463,WHO data shows something like a 60% fatality rate among documented H5N1 cases.
25464,"Although not likely to be that high in a pandemic scenario, even something like a 10% fatality rate would be massively disruptive."
25465,You guys will have more vaccine per capital than the US.
25466,I wouldn’t be so worried or paranoid
25467,Well you’re wrong.
25468,This is really me.
25469,I just have sense enough to trust real experts instead of thinking I’m smarter than them.
25470,More risky behavior with better health care?
25471,That seems to be a factor.
25472,Still not wise though in regards to the new virus.
25473,"It's Florida, so that's just the ones being reported."
25474,Multiply it by 3 and you'll have a more realistic number.
25475,"I would think this would be easy enough using their hospital ID cards or, as most places are doing, handling distribution at their facilities."
25476,"I don't think they are testing, but even if they were, they still recommend getting the vaccine even if you've had the virus."
25477,"However:

- Most people who are getting the vaccine haven't been infected yet (statistically)."
25478,- People who have been infected are less likely to seek out the vaccine immediately (my theory).
25479,They might wait until later.
25480,The reported 2m from the cdc is a huge undercount.
25481,Even the cdc admits this.
25482,The data is lagged anywhere from 3-7 days depending on the source.
25483,In reality we're more likely at 5-8m doses administered.
25484,Still not amazing but much better than the 2m number that is being quoted everywhere.
25485,What?
25486,Absolutely true.
25487,"And, with these stories about how the patient population treats you, it'll be even harder for rural hospitals to recruit workers."
25488,"Forever Lockdown

Jeff Bezos just felt a tingle."
25489,Correct.
25490,I'm in the AZ vaccine trial.
25491,Thank you.
25492,Means the rest of us move up one spot in line.
25493,people really don't realize what this vaccination effort entails and the data coming out now just isn't accurate.
25494,My wife works at a small community hospital and got her shot a week ago.
25495,Many many frontline healthcare workers are getting it and it's about to really amp up.
25496,Makes sense to mark the village idiots.
25497,"Your boss is probably worried about if you miss this chance, you might not get another dose."
25498,They aren't officially.
25499,The study doctor said they are planning to do a small study of those of us who got multiple different vaccines.
25500,Even though it is common to be banned from certain activities if you're missing a vaccine.
25501,"I got all my mandatory vaccines in Europe growing up but then I needed to get a bunch more (including meningitis, which isn't common where I'm from) to enroll in a US university."
25502,"Many were vaccines I'd already had but that I didn't have a record of, so I had to get them again."
25503,Then I got several vaccines when traveling to India that were not mandatory but recommend by my home country/doctor for people traveling there.
25504,I think that getting vaccinated in order to travel is quite common even if you're not going to a country that requires a vaccine for entry
25505,Can you point me to the world with no pre-existing conditions?
25506,The definition of clickbait
25507,"Nothing till mid next month for a single reason, holiday break."
25508,people just want to attack the media...
25509,The thing is something like 40% of Americans have pre-existing conditions.
25510,Early 2021?
25511,Maybe.
25512,The rest of 2021?
25513,Probably not.
25514,Everyone's panicking but it's probably going to be like testing.
25515,"In March they were super-rare, two months later you could get them for free in any major city with a short line."
25516,People in NYC we're swinging by City MD twice a week over the summer for one.
25517,That's already being done in Canada.
25518,"As I said, when you are under lockdown and occupancy limits on even outdoor gatherings limited to 10 people....how many pharmacies is it going to take to vaccinate millions of people a day?"
25519,I really don't think many people have thought this through.
25520,There is no way in hell we are going to make a serious dent in vaccinations until cases numbers are way down and restrictions are lifted.
25521,Still have lots of yeast leftover from Lockdown 1.0
25522,Yes I read that.
25523,It is over 55 percent more transmissible however still offers the same effects so their saying vaccines will still work as of now
25524,It's not so much about whether they work - it's more about how long until the virus mutates *again*?
25525,"Current data is showing that the vaccine is effective against the new strain, yes, but a new strain could pop up tomorrow, or the day after."
25526,At what point does it mutate to where the vaccine is no longer effective?
25527,Some are.
25528,Saying most of the middle class are doing just as good if not better is far too broad.
25529,"Even the chestnut seller isn’t wearing a mask, you know he must have maskless people coming up to him to purchase."
25530,Then there are coughs or sneezes that could infect these people as they walk.
25531,I remember reading that the real covid death toll in India was 50/60% higher...
25532,It needs to be nearly 10 million shots per weak.
25533,"If we target 200 million people vaccinated, that's 400 million shots."
25534,"At 10 million shots per week with the current drugs, we will achieve herd immunity in October, which is far behind the"
25535,Like I care
25536,While I agree with much of what you said...
25537,The problem with fines is that people just keep on disregarding the rules after they get caught.
25538,People who get speeding tickets don’t tend to stop speeding.
25539,They just get better at spotting speed traps.
25540,"&gt;ANKARA (Reuters) - Turkey aims to produce Russia’s Sputnik V COVID-19 vaccine domestically but has asked for more information about it before inoculating its citizens, Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu said on Tuesday."
25541,"Russia has announced several international deals for the supply of Sputnik V, named after the Soviet-era satellite that triggered the space race in a nod to the project’s geopolitical importance for Moscow."
25542,"However, while Health Minister Fahrettin Koca said last week “we are now certain the vaccine is effective and safe”, the trial data, based on 29 infections, was seen as too limited for final approvals."
25543,Im pretty sure JNJ are doing both a single dose and a double dose regimen study - and just the fact that they started their two-dose study afterwards indicates that the one dose maybe wasn't producing the efficacy they were hoping for(or well the 95% standard that was set by BNT/pfizer and Moderna.
25544,"70-85% would have been great before their results - now, not so much..)"
25545,I drink at least a cup a day
25546,"I have had alcoholics in my family, some recovering and some passed away so I have a fairly good perspective on this."
25547,"Going cold turkey has not killed anybody I know so sorry, you’re just trying to extrapolate this to lend more to your argument."
25548,"If you are that dependent on alcohol that it’s keeping you alive, well then you got some serious problems

And as a South African, the bigger problem is shebeens (illegal drinking taverns) and social drinking."
25549,That’s what this ban is in place for.
25550,A lot of my friends have a built up a fair amount of personal stock because they were anticipating this and if you weren’t then you’re an idiot.
25551,They did it before so it was definitely going to happen again and with the numbers rising like they have the government really had no other option.
25552,How's that gonna do the spread?
25553,"A poll shows that about \~60-65% of the seculars are willing to get vaccinated right away, \~40% of the Ultraorthodox and \~30% of the Arabs."
25554,But the numbers change rapidly.
25555,90% in one country and 50% in the other indicates trials conducted completely differently.
25556,That sort of range can't exist with large numbers.

25590,&gt; You’re Infected With the Coronavirus.
25591,But How Infected?
25592,&gt; Knowing the amount of virus carried in the body could help doctors predict the course of a patient’s illness.
25593,"&gt; Dec. 29, 2020, 5:00 a.m."
25594,"ET
&gt; A patient in the emergency room of a hospital in Los Angeles awaited the results of a Covid test this month."
25595,"&gt; A patient in the emergency room of a hospital in Los Angeles awaited the results of a Covid test this month.Jae C. Hong/Associated Press
&gt; As Covid-19 patients flood into hospitals nationwide, doctors are facing an impossible question."
25596,Which patients in the E.R.
25597,"are more likely to deteriorate quickly, and which are most likely to fight off the virus and to recover?"
25598,"&gt; As it turns out, there may be a way to help distinguish these two groups, although it is not yet widely employed."
25599,"Dozens of research papers published over the past few months found that people whose bodies were teeming with the coronavirus more often became seriously ill and more likely to die, compared with those who carried much less virus and were more likely to emerge relatively unscathed."
25600,"&gt; The results suggest that knowing the so-called viral load — the amount of virus in the body — could help doctors predict a patient’s course, distinguishing those who may need an oxygen check just once a day, for example, from those who need to be monitored more closely, said Dr. Daniel Griffin, an infectious disease physician at Columbia University in New York."
25601,"&gt; Tracking viral loads “can actually help us stratify risk,” Dr. Griffin said."
25602,"The idea is not new: Managing viral load has long formed the basis of care for people with H.I.V., for example, and for tamping down transmission of that virus."
25603,&gt; Little effort has been made to track viral loads in Covid-19 patients.
25604,"This month, however, the Food and Drug Administration said clinical labs might report not just whether a person was infected with the coronavirus, but an estimate of how much virus was carried in their body."
25605,"&gt; This is not a change in policy — labs could have reported this information all along, according to two senior F.D.A."
25606,officials who spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly about the matter.
25607,"&gt; Still, the news came as a welcome surprise to some experts, who have for months pushed labs to record this information."
25608,"&gt; “This is a very important move by the F.D.A.,” said Dr. Michael Mina, an epidemiologist at the Harvard T.H."
25609,Chan School of Public Health.
25610,"“I think it’s a step in the right direction to making the most use of one of the only pieces of data we have for many positive individuals.”

&gt; The F.D.A.’s change followed a similar move by the Florida Department of Health, which now requires all labs to report this information."
25611,"&gt; The omission of viral load from test results was a missed opportunity not just to optimize strained clinical resources, but also to better understand Covid-19, experts said."
25612,"Analyzing the viral load soon after exposure, for example, could help reveal whether people who die from Covid-19 are more likely to have high viral loads at the start of their illnesses."
25613,"&gt; And a study published in June showed that the viral load decreases as the immune response surges, “just like you’d expect it to be for any old virus,” said Dr. Alexander Greninger, a virologist at the University of Washington in Seattle, who led the study."
25614,"&gt; Coronavirus Briefing: An informed guide to the global outbreak, with the latest developments and expert advice."
25615,&gt; An uptick in the average viral load throughout entire communities could indicate an epidemic on the rise.
25616,"“We can get an idea of whether the epidemic is growing or declining, without relying on case counts,” said James Hay, a postdoctoral researcher in Dr. Mina’s lab."
25617,"&gt; Fortunately, data on viral load — or at least a rough approximation of it — is readily available, built into results from the P.C.R."
25618,tests that most labs use to diagnose a coronavirus infection.
25619,&gt; A P.C.R.
25620,"test is performed in “cycles,” each doubling the amount of viral genetic material originally drawn from the patient’s sample."
25621,"The higher the initial viral load, the fewer cycles the test needs to find genetic material and produce a signal."
25622,"&gt; A positive result at a low cycle threshold, or Ct, implies a high viral load in the patient."
25623,"If the test is not positive until many cycles have been completed, the patient probably has a lower viral load."
25624,"&gt; Researchers at Weill Cornell Medicine in New York recorded viral loads among more than 3,000 hospitalized Covid-19 patients on the day of their admission."
25625,"They found that 40 percent of patients with high viral loads — whose tests were positive at a Ct of 25 or below — died while in the hospital, compared with 15 percent of those with positive tests at higher Ct’s and presumably lower viral loads."
25626,&gt; Doctors observed a Covid patient in the I.C.U.
25627,"Data on viral load, or at least an approximation of it, is readily available in the results from P.C.R."
25628,"tests, which most labs use to diagnose infection."
25629,&gt; Doctors observed a Covid patient in the I.C.U.
25630,"Data on viral load, or at least an approximation of it, is readily available in the results from P.C.R."
25631,"tests, which most labs use to diagnose infection.Jae C. Hong/Associated Press
&gt; In another study, the Nevada Department of Public Health found an average Ct value of 23.4 in people who died from Covid-19, compared with 27.5 in those who survived their illnesses."
25632,"People who were asymptomatic had an average value of 29.6, suggesting they carried much less virus than the other two groups."
25633,"&gt; These numbers may seem to vary by very little, but they correspond to millions of viral particles."
25634,"“These are not subtle differences,” Dr. Greninger said."
25635,"A study from his lab showed that patients with a Ct of less than 22 had more than four times the odds of dying within 30 days, compared with those with a lower viral load."
25636,&gt; But the use of Ct values to estimate viral load is a fraught practice.
25637,Viral load measurements for H.I.V.
25638,"are highly precise, because they are based on blood samples."
25639,Tests for the coronavirus rely on swabbing the nose or throat — a procedure subject to user error and whose results are less consistent.
25640,&gt; The amount of coronavirus in the body changes drastically over the course of the infection.
25641,"The levels rise from undetectable to yielding positive test results in just hours, and viral loads continue to increase until the immune response kicks in."
25642,&gt; Then viral loads quickly decline.
25643,"But viral fragments may linger in the body, triggering positive test results long after the patient has stopped being infectious and the illness has resolved."
25644,"&gt; Given this variability, capturing viral load at one point in time may not be useful without more information about the trajectory of illness, said Dr. Celine Gounder, an infectious disease specialist at Bellevue Hospital Center and a member of the incoming administration’s coronavirus advisory group."
25645,&gt; “When on that curve are you measuring the viral load?” Dr. Gounder asked.
25646,&gt; The exact relationship between a Ct value and the corresponding viral load can vary between tests.
25647,"Rather than validate this quantitative relationship for each machine, the F.D.A."
25648,authorized the tests to deliver diagnoses based on a cutoff for the cycle threshold.
25649,"&gt; Most manufacturers conservatively set their machine’s thresholds for diagnosis from 35 to 40, values that generally correspond to an extremely low viral load."
25650,"But the exact threshold for a positive result, or for a specific Ct to indicate infectiousness, will depend on the instrument used."
25651,"&gt; “That’s why I get very anxious about a lot of these assessments on the basis of Ct values,” said Susan Butler-Wu, director of clinical microbiology at the University of Southern California."
25652,"&gt; “Certainly, it is a value that can be useful in certain clinical circumstances,” Dr. Butler-Wu said, “but the idea that you can have a unicorn Ct value that correlates perfectly with an infectious versus noninfectious state makes me very nervous.”

&gt; Other experts acknowledged these limitations, but said the benefit from recording Ct values outweighed the concerns."
25653,"&gt; “All of those are valid points when looking at an individual patient’s test results, but it doesn’t change the fact that on average, when you look at the admission test results of these Ct values, they really identify patients at high risk of decompensating and dying,” said Dr. Michael Satlin, an infectious diseases physician and lead researcher of the Weill Cornell study."
25654,&gt; Dr. Satlin said adjusting his team’s results for duration of symptoms and several other variables did not alter the high risk of death in patients with high viral loads.
25655,"“No matter how you try to adjust, statistically, this association is extremely strong and will not go away,” he said."
25656,"&gt; At a population level, too, Ct values can be valuable during a pandemic, Dr. Hay said."
25657,"High viral loads in a large group of patients can indicate recent exposure to the virus, signaling a nascent surge in community transmission."
25658,"&gt; “This could be a great surveillance tool for less well-resourced settings who need to understand the epidemic trajectory, but do not have the capacity to carry out regular, random testing,” Dr. Hay said."
25659,"&gt; Over all, he and others said, viral load information is too valuable a metric to be ignored or discarded without analysis."
25660,"&gt; “One of the things that’s been tough in this pandemic is everybody wants to do evidence-based medicine and wants to go at the appropriate speed,” Dr. Greninger said."
25661,"“But we also should expect certain things to be true, like more virus is usually not good.”"

Are you saying that lies are a function of time?"
25852,Every time I post anything negative about the vaccine I get downvoted.
25853,So let's start with the positive!
25854,We have multiple vaccines!
25855,This is a phenomenal achievement.
25856,I fully support and believe in vaccines.
25857,But we have Zero!
25858,Zero real data on the Vaccine and the UK Variant.
25859,Even the CEO said if the current vaccine does not work on the UK they will just make a new vaccine.
25860,Regeneron uses an antibody cocktail consisting of multiple variants of monoclonal antibodies.
25861,We should understand that we will need a combo vaccine in the future.
25862,"Oxford is partnering on a combo vaccine (Oxford/Sputnik V) I can see this being the norm in 2022

This is not negative, but a realistic assessment of what's needed."
25863,"We are already seeing escape mutations, they are rare but they are here."
25864,1918 Flu never went away.
25865,Honestly the fact that the Midwest is doing fine and other states with similar apathy to the rules are having horrible breakouts is convincing me that it's the new strain.
25866,"That would be an enormous ethical infraction with a trial (unregistered and changing the trial after informed consent), so no."
25867,They cannot possibly be doing that.
25868,"Yes, but to this crowd, the rules to life are written down in a book and that never changes so learning is evil."
25869,Yes.
25870,"Millions of doses already given, people didn't die."
25871,"Millions of Covid cases, you have thousands upon thousands of deaths."
25872,&gt; Not to downplay the seriousness - but we are freaking out over \~2 000 000 dead.
25873,Most of those dead are much older &amp;/or have serious co-morbitities.
25874,We have absolutely lucked out with this virus if you look at it in historical relativity.
25875,I think saying this is a global pandemic on the scale of the Spanish flu is fair.
25876,Yes more people died but so much was different in 1918.
25877,"We also understand viruses better, and have better medical care capacity."
25878,"On top of that, our social infrastructure is much stronger, fewer people in this world are going hungry which in turn lets us fight the pandemic better."
25879,Hunger was a major factor in why children especially were vunerable to disease.
25880,"Also factor in when Spanish flu hit, the colonial governments in Africa, and Asia did not exactly invest in medical treatment for the locals."
25881,"In fact, most of the deaths for the Spanish Flu were centred in Asia and Africa, with the highest death counts were in China, India and Korea."
25882,"This time, those very same countries have actually fought the pandemic better than Western countries."
25883,"Finally, let's also not forget the fact that Spanish Flu hit in World War I, where troops were constantly being gassed, so they were coming home ill. Then they got hit with the flu, and died at much higher rate."
25884,One of the many reasons why the death rate peaked between ages of 17-24.
25885,"If Coronavirus hit in 1918, it would probably be as bad as Spanish flu, maybe slightly worse."
25886,late April*
25887,The thing is the average person rarely has to visit a hospital or call an ambulance.
25888,"If not for the news (“fake news”), they’d have no idea things are at a breaking point."
25889,"And since they don’t see it, they wont take it seriously."
25890,"Fine, nothing to report."
25891,I myself had the Pfizer one.
25892,Nothing to report there either.
25893,"It's only a matter of time before one of these highly virulent avian flu strains is able to ""mix"" with a highly contagious flu such as swine flu, inside an immunocompromised host - like a pig, and we will have something far worse than this."

25986,They worked as if the sample were viable.
25987,The researchers used a biohazard level 3 lab as well as additional precautions like taking antivirals while they were doing this project.
25988,"Here's the CDC writeup:

25989,No.

26008,A gap that long raise all kinds of issues.
26009,Getting people back for one.
26010,But also for assessing it in a trial - does everyone who gets infected between Dose 1 and Dose 2 just get dropped from the analysis?
26011,That's a hell of a survivorship bias to say the scheme is 95% effective.
26012,"Not to mention analysis of controls in equal circumstances, which is something AZ had a huge problem with the fist time, aggregating UK and Brazil."

26026,The Moderna vaccine is better in my opinion for us even if it is logistically harder to deal with and more expensive.
26027,I believe Americans will feel more comfortable taking it than the Oxford which has lost trust.
26028,We are already struggling to get the masses to agree to vaccination so I am not sure how successful this vaccine will be in convincing the US general population to go for it now.
26029,Based upon these trials and the amount of issues they are facing I would like to see the US focus more on the Moderna vaccine.

26062,He didn’t lie.
26063,Science is best current understanding.
26064,He presented best current understanding at two different points in time.
26065,"Here’s the timeline:

In early March, Fauci said “there's no reason to be walking around with a mask.”
In the same interview, he said people could wear masks if they liked, but they wouldn’t get perfect protection, and it would further pinch what at the time was a short supply of masks for doctors and nurses."
26066,"After researchers discovered that asymptomatic people were spreading the virus, the public health community shifted to recommending that everyone wear a mask."
26067,Universities sadly arent
26068,"I think 1 case per 100k is less than the false positive rate of the tests, so its literally impossible to achieve."
26069,I do believe when hospitalizations come down restriction loosening will follow.

26073,"I dont see why taxpayers should fund a $50,000 hospital visit when a $10 pill (in this case shot) could have avoided it."
26074,"If you dont believe doctors, why even get the $50,000 treatment?"
26075,It's the same people who told you oxy wasnt addictive.
26076,"Just cancel your insurance,  stay home and dont believe anything doctors say."

26078,Lol.

26080,"Hell, on behalf of Darwin, I encourage it."
26081,"However, *picking and choosing* what to believe hits my wallet, and that is unethical and immoral."
26082,They can’t know that without actually studying it.
26083,And the Bell’s palsy folks were roughly the normal number of people who develop Bell’s palsy just from nothing at all.
26084,It’s usually temporary.
26085,"That said, they expect given how robust the immune response is, for the vaccine effectiveness to last several years"
26086,A 78-year-old is 100x more likely to die of COVID than a “frontline” 40-year-old if they both catch it.
26087,"Not a scientist, but is this perhaps a roundabout way of addressing the problem from the initial phase 3 reports that giving people the full dose on the first shot primed their immune system too much, and that the half-dose on the first shot (perhaps) actually worked better?"
26088,"Rather than testing the half-dose/full-dose regimen which would require another trial, they are simply administering the full-dose first shot and then waiting an additional 1-2 months to deliver the second shot so that the first dose wears off a bit before they deliver the second dose?"
26089,Is there any reason to believe that this route is more effective than giving the half-dose/full-dose regimen 4 week apart as they (accidentally) did in some of the phase 3 trial participants?
26090,It is kinda weird.
26091,Liberal states that have mask mandates have large sections of the population not complying and their outbreak is increasing.
26092,On the other hand conservative states like Oklahoma (or Kansas I forget) have populace that is very vocal about not wearing mask.
26093,But once the state mandated it they reported a significant decrease in positives.
26094,To me it says that placing like Cali and NY reached the max number of people that will comply and if they didn't put the mandate order when they did they would be way worst off.
26095,And there is a large group of people in places like Oklahoma will wear a mask if mandated.
26096,At the same time there is a large body of people in both kinds of states that won't no matter what.
26097,"I just assumed that most of the people in anti-mask states wouldn't wear enough masks, even if mandated, to make any statistical difference."
26098,"This whole trial has been a shit show, they went from the leading vaccine to probably being passed by J&amp;J"
26099,"While the Trump team, including Fauci were stockpiling masks for themselves they told the public not to wear them..."

https://time.com/5107984/hospitals-handling-burden-flu-patients/"
26137,I love how the media conveniently leaves out the links between animal ag and pandemics.
26138,How about we stop the use and abuse of animals on a huge scale and nip the problem in the bud...
26139,Why is that?
26140,Benefits Fraud is not a hoax.
26141,"When you claim to suffer ""long COVID"" but have never tested positive or been diagnosed by a doctor, you are committing fraud."
26142,"After one vaccine dose, an individual is partially vaccinated."
26143,"After the second dose, they are considered fully vaccinated."
26144,"After any dose, they have some degree of vaccination."
26145,"I remember reading this back in february from official news sources, I think it was."
26146,I also remember reading about tens of millions of phone numbers were deactivated at one point.
26147,"Not saying these are people who died, but at least some of them were, probably."
26148,"We will never know, I guess."
26149,No your wrong.
26150,"Look at her dashboard, it shows virtually the same death toll as the states."
26151,"The dispute was over counting non-resident deaths, which account for obviously a relatively small percentage of deaths."
26152,You can also look at their excess death toll to see there is not anything wrong with their numbers...
26153,I’m just waiting for the antivaxers to show a baby that looks like Covid but with needles.
26154,"They already do that with a bunch of needles all bunched up for shock value, why not Covid too?"
26155,And hire actors to play healthcare workers!
26156,"You don’t have to cheer on gatherings, but you need to provide shame-free outlets to allow people to gather in small numbers."
26157,If you were expecting 100% compliance you were expecting wrong.
26158,So edgy 🙄
26159,"Political affiliation, sadly, has everything to do with this."
26160,"If the tables were turned and Trump has encouraged mask use and caution from the beginning, it would be your side lambasting anyone not following the guidance."
26161,"Your side would also make it an issue of ""patriotism""."
26162,This is probably your one and only test of your dedication to helping your country.
26163,And you failed it.
26164,have heard good things about Queens Gambit will check it out.
26165,Thanks!
26166,People post in the Sa Diego board asking what is still open for them to do during their visit here.
26167,"It’s like - don’t come to San Diego for vacation right now, just don’t."
26168,They don’t care and plan to come here anyway.
26169,It boggles my mind.
26170,Depends on the hospital.
26171,It's mostly scrubs nowadays.
26172,"Fact: In several States, ICU capacity is already past 100%."
26173,Sources in more than one of the articles l linked.
26174,This is not normal.
26175,ICUs are never this full.
26176,Keep trying.
26177,I hope so.
26178,"But based on his previous policies set in place, I'm not hopeful :("
26179,I know 2 separate healthcare workers who are declining to get the virus because the long term effects are unknown.
26180,"“A new vaccine typically takes years to develop and the fact that they cranked these out in 12 months is suspect.”

Kinda surprised me to hear tbh"
26181,"Whenever South Africa is mentioned, many fantastical tales seem to come out of the woodwork."
26182,Most of it is BS.
26183,Maybe having Covid drove down their immunity?
26184,"Because it was def bacterial pneumonia, about two weeks after Covid."
26185,And the folks who did not pay attention in their high school chemistry class and thinking that adding pure alcohol to your homebrew is what is needed to give it an extra skop.
26186,"China's total death toll is certainly not under 5000 and there are definitely some shenanigans in play, but unfortunately people have claimed they're ""lying"" without specifying what, how, when, and insinuated there are millions of Chinese dead and all sorts of insane claims."
26187,"If you just say they are lying, people might think you mean something like that."
26188,The conspiracy theorists will continue no matter what we do.
26189,It's time to do whats best for **all citizens**.
26190,If that means limiting travel between countries for those that don't comply I'm all for it.
26191,Same way that many concert venues are requiring vaccination for attendees.
26192,"If we want to beat this thing, we have got to get as many vaccinated as possible."
26193,That's what MacGuyver would do :)
26194,TIL that “long COVID is a hoax” is something people are gearing up to believe.
26195,Yikes.
26196,But definitely keep ranting about the CCP too.
26197,Their profile has like no comments too smh
26198,Wow that is so fucked up.
26199,I'm so sorry that you're being treated like that.
26200,I wish I was able to increase my staff because I would be out here making it rain healthy employment opportunities.
26201,It starts at the top and trickles its way down
26202,The top is called a tunic :)
26203,You know... as an American I wish I had soap box I could stand on here...
26204,"But frankly Americas soap box is made of cardboard, when it comes to Covid-19 we fall straight through."
26205,Nothing to be said... America has surpassed anyone on the planet for the worst handling of Covid-19 by a long shot.
26206,We are not in the position to judge or second guess anyone...
26207,"Yeah, that was literally what I just said - China has suppressed lots of whistle blowers."
26208,So has the USA.
26209,I'm sure when someone comments similarly about US data you don't hold their feet to the fire about being sympathisers.
26210,"This in spite of dozens of people being fired, demoted and otherwise in the US for reporting."
26211,"While the US has a better functioning legal system, Rebekah Jones is being investigated - so lets just wait."
26212,The US might end up breaking China's monopoly on that.
26213,"&gt; You seem to be a numbers person, but you want to paint all sources with the same brush.."
26214,The numbers don't mean shit when the source is shit.
26215,You are making no sense here.
26216,If the numbers look good the source is probably good.
26217,The numbers look in line with what 'good' sources show.
26218,The likelihood that good and bad sources provide similar numbers is incalculably small.
26219,If China had let the handful of 'earlier' whistle blowers blow the whistle it _doesn't change anything_.
26220,"The WHO and basically all other officials have all been so slow to update projections, new information."
26221,"What information did you want, and when did you want it?"
26222,Did you want to know that the pandemic was serious business when Zhang Zhan was reporting it?
26223,"Guess what - I already knew, because 10% of the worlds population was already under lock-down."
26224,"The USA funding it is also a ""miracle"""
26225,These objections are addressed in the article.
26226,Here’s to the beginning of the end!
26227,I think once the vaccine has been available to the wider public for like two or three months things are gonna go back to normal (not semblance of normal like 95% normal).
26228,At that point it falls on the individual for not taking initiative to get the vaccine and the economic and mental health damage I can't imagine would be justifiable at that point
26229,"Masks are uncomfortable, and if you are doing something fun it makes it hard to enjoy it."
26230,"I’ll wear it to the grocery store, doctor appointment, anything else essential, but I’m not going to endure a mask for something fun since it makes the activity not as enjoyable."
26231,I’ll wait until masks come off for the fun activities.
26232,I am South African.
26233,Never paid a bribe.
26234,If you visit our country do not think this is normal.
26235,Despite what Reddit says.
26236,This is a fair point
26237,It doesn't have to be an at will state if you draft a labor contract.
26238,Americans are stupid.

26245,The Data Tracker it links to does exactly that.
26246,Sorry you replied too early to actually read it.
26247,Yet again - one source from you saying 'Hospitals aren't struggling worse than normal this year because of COVID'.
26248,Not links to 3-year out of date stats on numbers of ICU beds.
26249,Not year old articles on flu cases.
26250,"One link from December 2020 saying ""things are no worse than normal."""
26251,Surely you must have hundreds of them to be so sure?
26252,I'm only asking for one.
26253,You want a lollipop after your vaccine shot?
26254,Amen to that.
26255,The people in the thread are absolutely ridiculous.
26256,Thank God they’re a bunch of do nothings in the real world.
26257,Because people stopped caring.
26258,"We always did so well and were never hit hard so people never started thinking the shutdowns were pointless, the virus isn’t that bad."
26259,"Kids are playing indoor sports, indoor dining opened back up, people are having parties (now indoors due to weather) schools started opening, people are flying all over for vacations."
26260,The restrictions aren’t enforced so people have stopped listening.
26261,I also wonder if LA has the more contagious strain
26262,I guess this is why some people are 'anti mask'.
26263,There's no reason to mandate them post pandemic but all it takes is a few 'experts' with stocks in a facemask company to permantely mandate them in the law
26264,"“Foreign agents”

Lmao what?"
26265,I don't quite follow your logic.
26266,"If people had been super supportive of gatherings and hadn't talked about the dangers, you think there would be fewer gatherings?"
26267,I don't think so.
26268,When are the goalposts going to stop moving?
26269,Can't the federal government send the navy hospitals there to help?
26270,I panicked for a sec and thought it said she died.
26271,Maybe this timeline isn’t so bad
26272,It's unlikely to be a dress..
26273,It'll be a tunic and trousers.
26274,I've not seen them striped like that before.
26275,"Some examples [here](https://www.nursingtimes.net/roles/nurse-managers/north-lincs-senior-nurses-now-in-the-navy-21-08-2013/)

Each hospital trust will have different uniforms and rules though."
26276,Some might wear scrubs too.
26277,Often the colour of the lines around the uniform will denote 'rank'
26278,I am sure people in LA county are going to start taking this seriously now right?
26279,Obviously this isn't just the flu right?
26280,"/S 

I wish more people would take this seriously, but unfortunately it doesn't seem to matter to a lot of people unless its happening to them."
26281, Eighteenth Amendment  :).
26282,But it is rather understandable considering that alcohol consumption in S.A is linked to the Covid-19 spread in South Africa.
26283,People love to party and drink over weekends esp over the Xmas/New Year holidays and they make impromptu street parties with no social distancing and masks in sight and combined with the new strain that is 70% more contagious it makes sense for our country.
26284,You’ll have to tackle and hold those dumb fuckers down to vaccinate them.
26285,Good luck with that!
26286,"Death rate is .3% overall, so clearly 45% of Americans aren’t highly susceptible to covid."
26287,Clearly some co-morbidities (or a combination of several) matter more than others.

26296,"Interesting that people like you immediately look for issues with a group associated with a renewed civil rights movement, and only want to talk about those perceived issues, ignoring the point they're making."
26297,It's almost like you don't care either.
26298,That's called creative accounting.
26299,Lol.
26300,There is no net.
26301,"All I had was fatigue and my arm swelled at the injection site and was hot, red, and painful."
26302,"Lasted a few days, but that's it."
26303,Okay that makes sense lol.
26304,Thanks for indulging my random internet questions.
26305,"You guys are fucking insufferable, jesus."
26306,I work for one of the larger ambulance companies in LA/OC and shits real bad.
26307,A lot of these hospitals would experience long wait times regardless of the pandemic but rona has stressed things to the extreme.
26308,One hospital in whittier straight up stopped letting people in the ambulance entrance the other day.
26309,Some hospitals are getting packed 13 ambulances deep because theres no beds to put these patients in.
26310,That may not sound bad but keep in mind one ambulance covers an area large enough to almost guarantee a maximum response time of a little over 8 minutes.
26311,So for this many ambulances to get tied up every day is absolutely insane.
26312,On top of that call volume has gone way up and morale has plummeted.
26313,Is there a picture of Winnie the Pooh at the Tianmen Square protests?
26314,Or was that falun gong?
26315,I don't think everyone from the first group got vaccinated yet.
26316,I imagine as the vaccines roll out the restrictions will change.
26317,"Once the most vulnerable are protected, the death rate will go down and this will make things easier."
26318,I imagine late spring + early summer will look different than it does now.
26319,"Fuck off with your lies

26320,i have a feeling that most people refusing vaccines aren't exactly the world traveler type.
26321,"This makes me wish I could have stayed in West Virginia just a little, but no, all the job opportunities are next door in Ohio..... with Do-Nothing-DeWine"
26322,so far it's been mostly people under 60 who have got the vaccine...hopefully we will start giving it to only old people soon
26323,This is why I left California for Texas.
26324,"While I think their policies are the right idea, I’m hoping Texas politicians will be able to carry them out better."
26325,Texas politicians just need a little guidance from us Californians :)
26326,those teeth tho....
26327,"My biggest hangup is that we had low positivity and hospitalizations in late summer/early fall, but a lot was still restricted."
26328,So I just feel like we are gonna be in halfway-to-normal limbo forever.
26329,I guess it's better than nothing.
26330,I love California but this whole thing is making me rethink if this is a good place for me to be able to live.
26331,I've never felt like I had so little control over my life.
26332,Good.
26333,Wish they'd do that in the USA.
26334,Tired of living amongst anti science dipshits.
26335,"Yeah, women wear trousers as well."

26338,"NYC seroprevalence was 27%, with 25k official deaths."
26339,Wuhan seroprevalence according to this news was 4.4% with \~3k official deaths.
26340,"The deaths, adjusted for seroprevalence, are roughly comparable."
26341,"If there were tens of thousands of deaths unreported in Wuhan, then NYC must have lost like 300,000 alone."
26342,same in california
26343,Are you Australian by chance?
26344,I lived in small town rural Ohio as a physical therapist for the elderly and kids with autism spectrum disorders and my coworkers and the kids families drove me to the point of moving out west due to their selfish and blunted mentality.
26345,In the EU you are likely to be taken care of...not here...so I'd hope you can see my point of view.
26346,I'd like to take a vaccine after the other people have shown the virus to stop spreading.
26347,The Chinese are full of shit
26348,73 million can't be wrong.... oh wait
26349,Not enough panic to stop people from throwing temper tantrums when asked to wear a mask and take a break from bar hopping.

26354,"We’ll probably be almost back to normal by May, although maybe large events still won’t be a thing and we’ll still have to wear masks indoors."
26355,I think the masks come off and mass gatherings are a thing again this summer.
26356,Why do they need a vaccine?
26357,Isn't their god protecting them?
26358,And if they still die isn't that their gods will?
26359,Are they not disobeying their god by refusing to die?
26360,"I’m starting to think that these daily threads are full of foreign agents and propagandists, especially compared to the comments in other threads in this sub."

26362,voted up so much?
26363,What is wrong with you people?
26364,"I have zero craps to give about your ""pandemic fatigue"" - people are dying, and you’re sitting here whining because you have to sit at home."
26365,I think around late March things will be somewhat better.
26366,if they didn't want the vaccine at least the virus migh tfix em...
26367,When I moved to Chicago people thought I was from Texas for various reasons.
26368,Got some interesting comments.
26369,"Yup, same in LA and SoCal."
26370,Mass testing program rolled out in May.
26371,"At first I didn't go because I was locked down so didn't see the point, but as we were able to move round more with less lockdown restrictions, I started going every other week."
26372,Sometimes every week if my friends and I were planning to meet up.
26373,It's truly been the lifesaver in balancing mental health of my need to be social and my insurance I'm not spreading the virus.
26374,Maybe this isn't a helpful definition of the big one.
26375,Death rates are a calculation of circumstance.
26376,If you have a highly infectious disease in which 20% of those infected require hospitalization.

26378,"No, there is also a standard top/trousers uniform which is worn by men and women"

26393,what's the name of it?
26394,Gotta disagree on the college part.
26395,I think a lot of schools will basically have to reopen fully in the fall because of how important Room and Board revenue is to them.
26396,I think many schools will literally run out of money otherwise.
26397,&gt;I do feel bad for his family though- hopefully he doesn't end up killing his elderly mother-in-law.

26401,"Well, you could."

26411,"Some states will be higher, some will be lower."
26412,"But on average, the US is facing similar icu occupancy as winters in the past."
26413,That's what orthodox jews think
26414,USA's flaws addressing the pandemic does not excuse China.
26415,"Nor can you compare frivolous lawsuits and charges, politically motivated, that will undoubtedly be thrown out by legitimate and free US courts to what is happening in China, which amount to no less than suppressing the truth by imprisoning people."

26433,Human incompetence
26434,That differs from your original post.
26435,Your attempting to spin.
26436,&gt; the fact that there were countries with very strict lockdowns that are currently also getting fucked over because lockdowns aren't sustainable and only delay when a big wave will kick off.

26438,Source?
26439,"&gt;Just tell the old people to stay home, and let the rest keep more or less live their normal lives just with additional safety measures like masks."

26442,States are pointing out that while they would often call on neighbouring States to take over spill they can't this year because there is no spare capacity anywhere.
26443,What point are you trying to make?

26450,I totally agree with you.
26451,I can see traveling outside North America for those that decide to skip this vaccine to be highly problematic
26452,Florida’s leadership are just a bunch of science deniers.
26453,This is what you get as a result.
26454,The fact it can spread presymptomatically as well has led to this pandemic to what it is today.
26455,"With the first SARS virus and MERS, people weren't contagious until they showed symptoms, meaning it's vastly easier to identify who has the virus and quarantine them."
26456,"With COVID-19, people are unknowingly spreading it which makes it all the worse."
26457,"No it wasn’t enough, because people were never going to do that for a full year."
26458,Your plan has already fallen apart.
26459,Outside and six feet apart is not an acceptable substitute for human contact unless we live in a country of robots.
26460,The US should have instead focused on the bubble concept: take a small number of people or households and allow them to gather with no restrictions.
26461,"Even though many people won’t follow it, it drives home two fundamentals:

1."
26462,"Consistent social group 

2."
26463,"Small social group 

Instead you said “you’d better not gather with a single soul inside or less than six feet apart for at least a year” then acted all surprised when people couldn’t take that."
26464,"Like seriously, what did you expect from people?"
26465,"No, that's unconstitutional."
26466,If they're healthcare workers they should know that normally most of this time is spent getting funding and volunteers.
26467,There's loads of people that volunteered for the covid trials that hadn't even considered participating in a trial before.
26468,"Plus it's difficult to get funding for your vaccine for insert rare disease with minimal commercial usage, covid vaccines had money thrown at them."
26469,Foreign agent confirmed
26470,How’s it going ?
26471,"Even that article basically only said ""maybe people will wear them more during flu season""."
26472,"I haven't really seen any examples of ""we need masks forever""."
26473,Could be wrong though
26474,How does more money take the load off?
26475,I’ve read a few of these articles and it concerns me that seemingly there’s little to no safety data yet for these populations.
26476,"I remember with the new Shingles vaccine, at first my rheumatologist pushed me to get it ASAP but then a week later told me to hold off because many of her lupus patients were reporting difficult to control flare ups after getting the vaccine."
26477,"Since a key part of a vaccine is irritating the immune system, it seems like it’s not surprising that it might affect those with an autoimmune disorder."
26478,Before anyone calls me an anti-vaxxer: after a few more months they eventually declared Shingrix safe for those with autoimmune disorders and I got the vaccine.
26479,I can’t wait to get the COVID-19 vaccine but I am afraid to do it while there is seemingly no data on how people with autoimmune disorders respond.
26480,"""Those who make peaceful revolution impossible, make violent revolution inevitable."""
26481,John F. Kennedy
26482,One can decide not to get the vaccine and not go traveling overseas when the host nation requires it.
26483,"That beats my country, the vaccine is approved, we have doses ready to go."
26484,Start date 8th of januari because they didn't arrange everything yet.
26485,DAE CHINA BAD???
26486,Upvotes to the left 😏
26487,If I’m free to isolate at home why am I not free to require people to have a vaccine before entering my business?
26488,It needs not to be solely dependent on the police to enforce mask rules.
26489,Teachers should enforce it at schools.
26490,Shopkeepers need to enforce it at their shops and office managers need to enforce it in their office spaces.
26491,"When minor offenders are shoo-ed everywhere, the situation would be much better than what we are in now."

26500,“Climate lockdowns” are already being discussed and Corona bros are never going to stop shaming people for living their lives because they get Internet points and a sense of belonging for it.
26501,Just look at this year's data trackers.
26502,Please.
26503,"Hospitals on average are more full than usual as is shown in multiple sources l've linked to and you, so far, have not."
26504,And weeks later they will still be OK while antivaxers scream about the deadly poison in the vaccines...
26505,"Anecdotally, there are massive piles (100k+) of unused vaccines while the hospitals are trying to figure out who to prioritize."
26506,At least this is currently the case in Seattle.
26507,What is an independent monitoring board for $500 Alex?
26508,"This guy and the AZ CEO yesterday...

Release trial data when it's done or shut up"
26509,"I've noticed there is a weird almost permanent middle class in the USA, but there really not middle class more lower upper class."
26510,"For whatever reason they seem really prone to this kind of stuff, and I have no idea how they have any money besides inheriting it."
26511,They seem very prone to goofy antivax stuff

26520,She was arrested for breaking into quarantine areas and harassing patients and medical personnel.
26521,"The videos of her ""reporting"" are freely available online."
26522,"The rollout has been very slow, but I’ve seen done nursing homes locally getting the vaccine."
26523,So that’s great to see.
26524,It’s a little more than nothing.
26525,Hopefully it’s unrelated.
26526,But just hours after?
26527,"I mean, where do you draw the line with being “overly optimistic”?"
26528,Quote a few liberals have blinders on when it comes to GMOs and “big pharma.” But generally liberals are more respectful of science and reality than conservatives.
26529,With the amount of vaccine scepticism I'd think the amount of people taking in fake health documents wouldn't be that great.
26530,The article did say that not all those were Covid deaths.
26531,"Obviously early on facing an unknown illness, they were probably unsure of best treatment practices, and I’m sure as hospitals were overwhelmed trying to figure out how to deal with it, people did not receive the care they did otherwise or would possibly have been turned away."
26532,So deaths of all kinds could have legit been higher.
26533,"Tens of thousands higher I can’t say, but that could be why the numbers the articles claim don’t compare as well to NY?"
26534,ACCURATE “excess death” counts are about the only thing that could really tell us 🤷‍♀️
26535,You split the society by people who are vaccinated or those who are not.
26536,"Don't get me wrong, I like the concept as well."
26537,"But many concepts are only good in theory and not so much in practice, see communism."
26538,"&amp;#x200B;

Personal opinion: people who refuse to get vaccinated tend to be less educated, thus more likely to solve their problems in a physical way."
26539,Violence cannot be ruled out as a consequence.
26540,Does anyone know if the Johnson &amp;Johnson vaccine has to be diluted?
26541,I want to get the simplest vaccine available.
26542,"Simple storage,  one dose, and simple administration."
26543,I want to get as close to zero on human error as possible.
26544,I have a lot of coworkers saying the same thing.
26545,To hell with them.
26546,"I got my first shot last week, and I'm looking forward to the second round."
26547,Just wait until they find a way to counterfeit these because they will of course
26548,DP?
26549,"RIP doomers lmao

The vaccine has &gt;90% efficacy and still works remarkably well after only one shot."
26550,Infections won't go to zero but deaths are going to plummet in the next 2 months as vulnerable people get vaccinated.
26551,"More overwhelmed with covid, yes, but not more overwhelmed in general."
26552,78% average is normal.
26553,Over here in Germany they managed to inject several workers with the full vial rather than 1/5th of a vial like it says in bold letters....

26574,[removed]
26575,Once the elderly and those with health issues are vaccinated there won’t be that critical of a push and eventual herd immunity will set in.
26576,Same as the flu each year in which roughly half of allAmericans get a flu shot.
26577,Those being mostly the elderly and those more susceptible.

26582,This thread is a much better representation of the general population than the other threads on here.
26583,People are sick of this and want it to be over.
26584,The social end of this pandemic is likely coming in a few months regardless of where we are with our vaccination efforts.
26585,"I used to live in Fairfax VA and it could take 3 hours to get to Silver Spring MD, I feel your pain."
26586,You don't get sick from the vaccine itself.
26587,The body reaction to try to create immunity is what makes you feel ill.
26588,Some immune compromised people don't have an inflammatory response.
26589,Just depends how your body responds.
26590,I don't even know when my body plans on kicking my own ass.
26591,So you support land confiscations from over represented groups?
26592,I think once the people in my family and my roommates families are vaccinated I'm probably gonna resume going to the gym and hanging out in small groups with people again (which would probably be April or May).
26593,I can't live like this for two years or more
26594,To be fair... ignorance is an international conspiracy.....
26595,"This is also a ratcheting problem for conservative areas - brain drain is a real thing, and the more intelligent people that exit, the worse the place gets, and only incentives smart folks to stay away more strongly."

26610,Will this be in March?
26611,Maybe.
26612,By May?
26613,Most certainly.
26614,Also recall that last spring the natural infections reduced rapidly in April and May.
26615,"Fixed by steroids (probably a shot of prednisone, has some shit side effects, but one dose isn't going to be bad, its taking it for a while at high doses and coming off that really suck) and antihistamines (good old benadryl, can be a pill or injection, either IM or IV) fairly quickly and easily administered on the spot."
26616,Neither change the vaccines outcome.
26617,It's an immune reaction.
26618,"Also don't know what was in those fillers, some people get shady stuff at salons, or even peoples houses, many have it done by a plastic surgeon in their practice with sterile technique and proven safe fillers."
26619,"The procedures, fillers, were also done pretty recently, 2 weeks for one, and 6 months."
26620,"It's inflammation, they can take care of it immediately."
26621,"It's not life threatening, but uncomfortable."
26622,I seriously doubt there is a vaccine maker who has the capacity to produce faster but isn’t
26623,As always: source?
26624,Why do you keep on BSing?
26625,Why on earth would we invite the CCP?
26626,Except the only reason they are going bankrupt is because somebody won’t leave their property or pay for it’s use.

26632,"My brother works for a large public utility that gave off 10 paid ""no medical proof needed"" days for those reporting symptoms."
26633,"However, you didn't have to prove you had symptoms."
26634,You only had to report that you had symptoms.
26635,The number of people who reported symptoms was significantly higher than what should have been the statistical norm.
26636,"That is, people gamed the system and took an extra 10 days of paid vacation."
26637,The premise of this article assumes that a majority of passengers are infected and that people are cheaters.
26638,This is a pretty big leap of faith to make.
26639,Can I ask why skeptical?
26640,"While this is the first mRNA vaccine being distributed to the public, the ingredient list for both Pfizer and the Moderna vaccines are publicly available."
26641,"Pretty safe looking ingredients, and the mRNA instruction just says make the spike protein."
26642,You've seen that we've vaccinated million of people all over the world now with them.
26643,They didn't die.
26644,And it's very very unlikely they will develop any long term complications that didn't arise soon after being vaccinated.
26645,Lol asymptomatic carriers would easily dismiss the retarded premise of this article.
26646,"3 years of shots later, and now with daily allergy drops, trees in spring and fall are still trying to kill me."
26647,The no fever/no work rule was easy to follow with severe allergies.
26648,"Even schools didn't care if you had a cold, as long as you weren't running a fever."
26649,Then Covid comes along and screws it all up by giving you sneezing and maybe coughing and no fever.
26650,"And, it could just be allergies."
26651,Thank heavens I work from home these days.
26652,"If I had been required to follow Covid rules instead of the no fever rules for attendance way back when in my call center days, I'd have been jobless, homeless, and probably starving during oak pollination seasons."

Moderna and Pfizer trials used placebo (saliene) while AZ used a meningitis vaccine, that way people will have symptoms in either arm of the trial."

27090,"Since starting the US trial, AZ has switched to using saliene as the placebo just like Pfizer and Moderna."

27183,Airplanes even with HEPA filters and UV lights(only on some airlines) are still the worst indoor spreading event for COVID.
27184,Why?
27185,Because when you exhale particles don’t instantly get sucked up into the Hvac intake.
27186,It lingers for up to 20’ before it is dissipated and/or pulled into the intake vents.
27187,The theorem on UV lights and HEPA is assuming there is massive suction occurring.
27188,It’s not happening on airline flights due to limited power on the hvac systems.
27189,All airplanes do not have the recommended suction of air to effectively reduce particles.

27197,"How, for example, does anyone imagine we'll be able to shuffle 20 million people through Walgreens when people are supposed to be staying home?"

27349,I was just saying there are plenty of nasty things in labs around the world which could be unleashed accidentally or on purpose at any moment.

27357,Partial vaccination confers some degree of protection.
27358,"Even once fully vaccinated, an individual is still at risk for becoming infected and shedding, though the risk is probably less."
27359,Fauci is deserving of criticism.
27360,"Rubio is a moron, so here's an article from June that makes the same points:

https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/us/dr-fauci-made-the-coronavirus-pandemic-worse-by-lying-about-masks/ar-BB15zyW3?pfr=1

&gt;Fauci, who sits on the Trump regime’s zombie-like coronavirus task force, hinted that he knew masks worked, he just wanted any available masks to be saved for health care workers."
27361,"&gt;“Well, the reason for that is that we were concerned the public health community, and many people were saying this, were concerned that it was at a time when personal protective equipment, including the N-95 masks and the surgical masks, were in very short supply,” Fauci said."
27362,"“And we wanted to make sure that the people, namely the health care workers, who were brave enough to put themselves in a harm way, to take care of people who you know were infected with the coronavirus and the danger of them getting infected.”

&gt;Fauci didn’t just fail to promote masks early on, he actively discouraged the use of masks, saying they didn’t work."
27363,"I doubt she has a PhD in immunology or vaccine research, else she wouldn't be a nurse practitioner."
27364,He probably doesn't want the senators to have to go on record as either siding with Trump (which is against the Republican 'cut big spending' philosophy) or opposing him.
27365,I think antibody testing showed that Wuhan ended up with around 8x actual cases vs positive tests.
27366,So we likely can take that as the upper bound.

27606,The reason this woman is getting so much attention is that she’s the first to receive the approved vaccine outside of trials.
27607,"She’s the first person to receive the vaccine with the sole intention of keeping her safe (not as a guinea pig to see if it’s safe), she’s the first person of her age to receive it, and she’s the first person to receive it as a part of the mass distribution to the public instead of within carefully selected and controlled trials."

27646,I called and complained to the office at the apartment that they didn’t have masks and she said she’d make sure they did next time (she didn’t sound too bothered which leads me to believe that they don’t have a mask policy to begin with).
27647,Was it over the top to get annoyed and end up not letting them come inside and then call about masks?

27695,isn't that what all the field hospitals we paid tens of millions of dollars for this summer?
27696,For over flow COVID patients.
27697,They went unused.
27698,Why is there no talk of opening those back up again if there is dire need?

27709,That sucks they wouldn't let you wait outside!
27710,"But honestly, if you were one of the first patients and the others were masked up properly, this sounds pretty low risk."

27715,The next day it had passed but I had some pretty intense muscle and joint pain.
27716,I was taking 3 Advil and 2 Tylenol at a time and it was just taking the edge off (I wonder now if it was a minor allergic reaction?)
27717,Luckily by day 3 what remained was some fatigue and low level muscle pain.
27718,By day 4 back to normal.
27719,"Had I not been warned about the side effects though, it would’ve scared the shit out of me."
27720,"And you’re right, the mRNAs are boost and prime vaccines."

27724,"My co-worker friend, in his mid-50s and who spent up until Thanksgiving sheltering in place except for groceries and doctors, decided to spend a week in Florida visiting theme parks."
27725,I wonder if he'll come back infected.
27726,At least he'll wear a mask everywhere and probably avoid indoor spaces as much as possible.
27727,"Luckily, we all WFH."
27728,"How does that explain one of the lowest death rates (at 58 per 100k) even with some of the densest population, high Hispanic population share, and being at the fore front of flights from China ?"

27731,"I can already hear the ""Biden failed"" commentary for when the mask for 100 days doesn't literally end the pandemic"

27733,This is obviously a data reporting artifact.
27734,"To see, look at individual county data, you'll see the same jump in many places very far from one another (e.g."
27735,NYC vs western NY).
27736,Well even then he admitted that it was a white lie to preserve PPE for frontline workers which means there was intention to deceive.
27737,To be fair a lot of that was Edison was being an unreasonable ass trying to claim that because his company invented the motion picture camera that he was therefore owed royalties from any movies made using it.

27740,"&gt; Masks, hand sanitizer, gloves reduces the spread of germs in general."
27741,God I'm so glad gloves didn't become mandatory.
27742,There was a time that I thought my county was going to mandate those face shields and I swear I thought I was gonna lose it if they did.
27743,I wish it was available sooner but the progress so far has been astounding.
27744,"A three week study of 11,000 does not confer information about partial immunity."
27745,The more important stat of these vaccines so far is that 0% of people have had a poor COVID outcome.
27746,"I read in the FAQ about precautions after vaccination, but the section is kind of brief."

27754,"There is no evidence that death rates will catch up as well, as even current death rate at 600 per 1mn is one of the lowest in the country"
27755,Not meaningless to the real Christian...any action that supports and comforts another human being.
27756,"Aight, that was pretty damn good fam."
27757,I saw on Twitter that the Feds basically said states have to do distribution all by themselves once they get the vaccine shipments and that means relying on notoriously underfunded state health departments.
27758,Apparently Warp Speed gave the states very little money to this point for actual distribution.
27759,I hope the new money in the stimulus remedies this to some extent
27760,"Yes it is, Johnson and Johnson are also working on one as well along with a bunch of others ."

27763,"I could very well be wrong, though."
27764,There’s so much wrong with that comment I’ve got no idea what to say.
27765,"Masks have been used before for a long time, look at Ebola in Africa, sars, tb, even Spanish flu, masks have been around."
27766,Please explain the motive the government would have for making people wear masks other than trying to keep the population alive.
27767,Where do you get your news?

27879,that would be more orderly and easy to execute.
27880,"80+, then 70+, then 60+, then 50+, then 40+, then everyone else."
27881,And maybe give a slush fund of vaccines for hospitals to administer how they see fit.
27882,I never said the vaccine isn’t useful if not sterilizing.
27883,My concern is a population of happy spreaders who are not educated about the risk of infecting others despite being vaccinated.
27884,85% efficacy means that you're about 3 times more likely to get sick then you would with the BioNTech or Moderna vaccines.
27885,That is a big difference.

27955,“It’s ONLY 2 out of 100 kids!
27956,My kids are healthy!” The “otherism” and toxic individuality is staggering.
27957,"That is true, but that’s not the current plan."
27958,Just what it is right now.
27959,🤣🤣🤣 the only toxicity I see is the fearmongering
27960,This is sooo going to be removed very soon.
27961,"&gt;The article you linked to, have assumptions."
27962,"One that you can  extrapolate from the healthcare workers to the general population  (continued level of re-exposure to the covid-19, general health, age  etc.)."
27963,Extrapolation would always need to be done when it comes to applying any findings to general society.
27964,This is the case for any scientific study regarding a disease's impact on people.
27965,My problem is that the data within the study itself to form their is being extrapolated.
27966,"No where in the study I posted did they use ""probable"" events to form their argument."
27967,"Even still, how would this extrapolation work against their conclusion, though?"
27968,"You would think, for example, that healthcare workers would be more prone to reinfection than any other occupation."
27969,"So compared to the general population, you can extrapolate that the chances for reinfection are even less."
27970,"I won't even go into the article you posted, as I see you already got torn apart for it when posted in r/COVID19."
27971,"And funnily enough, it's for similarly shoddy science."
27972,It really is starting to appear that you have a serious case of confirmation bias.
27973,"""Not more severe"" does not mean ""less severe."""
27974,Funny hearing how perception of time has changed for everyone.
27975,"You’re similar to most people I talk to, but I’m the opposite - a two week span feels like 4 or 5 days."
27976,This whole year has been a blur.
27977,I’m just hoping it slows back down when I’m not stuck at home all the time :-/
27978,IM NOT SHUTTING THIS FUCKING PRODUCTION DOWN!
27979,!
27980,Can't speak for LA county but Riverside was dead in terms of traffic this morning.
27981,I would attribute that more to holiday vacations than the stay home order though.
27982,They weren't developed to provide sterilizing immunity.
27983,"It's an issue, but not a *surprise*."
27984,Sorry.
27985,Florida must be laughing its ass off at this: [https://pbs.twimg.com/media/EqbvOUjXMAIMyU7?format=jpg&amp;name=large](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/EqbvOUjXMAIMyU7?format=jpg&amp;name=large)
27986,At least there is a rollout in the US.
27987,I would be happy if the same progress would be made in Europe.
27988,Hey I’m not trying to say that the vaccine is bad.
27989,Everyone should definitely get vaccinated and I know the risk of having some kind of life-threatening reaction to them are near zero.
27990,All I was saying was that I had a problem with the numbers used because I felt like they were inaccurate/misleading.
27991,"When you can't enforce your words, you're basically asking."
27992,[deleted]
27993,"Disclaimer:  WHO reserves the right to retract this statement at any time as the current situation evolves, as it did with masks."
27994,What scientists?
27995,You mentioned your relatives dying and spam emogies in the same comment?
27996,I'm sorry but don't believe you.
27997,The elderly are at risk because of their weak immune systems.
27998,Their week immune systems mean that they won’t respond as well to a vaccine.
27999,"Plus, as callous as it sounds, most people in nursing homes don’t have a lot of time left even without the pandemic."
28000,So there’s a strong argument to be made that you’ll get more bang for your buck and save more years of life by vaccinating essential workers first.
28001,Check settings on your app and see if it will open the link in the app browser and not external browser.
28002,"If it's less severe, that's good news atleast"
28003,"&gt;So we accepted research submitted to other agencies with minor tweaks to be compliant, cutting bureaucracy allowing the final submission to be quicker."
28004,The most time consuming part is not bureaucracy but giving independent experts time to give their feedback.
28005,The EMA had a public hearing of experts and a meeting of national experts the UK did not have that.
28006,"Yes because a rushed, experimental vaccine 
That the companies that make them cannot be taken to court for damages or deaths caused by the vaccine will definetly do that🤦🏼‍♂️ 

Fauci and Gates have also both said that these restrictions will continue even to 2022."
28007,Or people can realize that they have the power and they could end this right now if they force the goverments of the world to stop with all these bullshit restrictions.
28008,Taking this vaccine will not give us back normalcy.
28009,Almost like compliance with the goverment doesn’t suit the interests of the people
28010,Should ramp up quickly.
28011,But i do think everyone has been way too optimistic talking about spring time.
28012,I think everyone should probably be able to get a vaccine in summer if they want it.
28013,"Fall should probably be fairly normal, schools completely open and maybe just some mask restrictions, probably some distancing guidelines and precautions in crowded events."
28014,I don't think we reach herd immunity.
28015,It's a problem for public health but technically at some point that doesn't matter for everyone individually.
28016,"If the vaccine is available, it's personal responsibility for people to get it, everything should end up open."
28017,It is during crisis management.
28018,It is a shame people force medical professionals to make such life or death calculations.
28019,"The USA has vaccinated more than all of Europe combined, and more than any other country in the world as far as I'm aware."
28020,And we're starting with vacines on 8th of january.. altough we already have them in stock.
28021,Only country in the EU that's fucked up the preparations.
28022,With Astra Zeneca you never know... even that data may be misleading.
28023,They pieced together parts of their data in the UK trial to come up with the 90% number despite the whole of their data showing 62% efficacy.
28024,Moderna and Pfizer never had to skew their data to pull out efficacy numbers well over 90%z.
28025,Don't be such a downer.
28026,Who knows what will happen.
28027,Mitch could get COVID and die.
28028,Your aren't supposed to ask those kinds of questions on this sub.
28029,People here only like facts when they support a doom and gloom prognosis.
28030,"I for one would love to know why officials just throw their hands up and say ""there aren't enough nurses"" as if that's just that."
28031,"Why didn't we cross train nurses from other specialties, bring in military medics to hard hit areas, rebuild those temporary yet unused hospitals from the spring?"
28032,"Anyone could see that hospitals were going to get busier in the fall, as they do every fall even without a pandemic, yet state officials didn't see any of this coming?"
28033,Something doesn't smell right.

28035,*Even*?
28036,The USA is built on cancerous MSM.
28037,Smallpox only exists in labs and only exists if for any reason a strain of it pops up it can be researched.
28038,The virus does not exist in nature and is considered eradicated by the WHO.
28039,"You spouted some sourceless facts which do not disprove my statement, which is viruses can be eradicated as there have been two cases of eradicated virusses."
28040,I sourced my statement.
28041,You didnt.
28042,Where did “less severe” come from?
28043,&gt;Scientists in the United Kingdom believe the variant strain to be more contagious than previously identified strains but not more severe.
28044,Authorized vaccines are thought to be effective against the variant.
28045,"According to models, it has an increased transmission rate of 70% compared with other variants in the U.K."
28046,"If it’s more transmissible, virology would suggest that it is less harmful."
28047,I don't see anything wrong with identifying someone who doesn't have proper immunity.
28048,"It's the best ""hey look I'm an idiot who rejects science because it hurts my feelings"" indicator I can think of."
28049,You keep talking about the first chapter of the economics book.
28050,I'm asking you to read the later chapters of the economics book.
28051,And hopefully to work in the field for a bit if you haven't already.
28052,"I spent the last 15 years as an entrepreneur, 7 of it in Fintech, and 3 doing startup investing."
28053,"I know economics and how the debt works - otherwise I'd be broke (and unemployed) by now :)

As for the meritorics of what you're saying - opportunity cost is when you have to choose one or the other."
28054,"In case of debt, as long as you have a positive ROI, in many cases you don't have to choose really (with exceptions related to risk management and so on)."
28055,"Also, by saying that it's the opportunity cost that matters you really confirmed what I'm saying."
28056,I said that taking debt to finance healthcare doesn't *necessarily* cost the citizens.
28057,You're saying that it *only* costs them if it means that the country cannot take debt to something that has a higher ROI than healthcare - which is compatible with what I said :)
28058,Ive been saying the same thing since March because I have COPD
28059,Can you catch this strain if you already had covid a few months back?
28060,"Zhang Zhan is actually one of those crazy Kare.ns who say masks and quarantine makes you a slave, knocks down quarantine fences, yells at random passerbys and even admits on her own channel that she is not a journalist."
28061,But don't take my word for it.
28062,She has a YouTube channel and people have posted her own videos on Twitter.
28063,"https://mobile.twitter.com/skkboz/status/1343575199384420352

We have many of these brave citizen journalists in the US too, if you want to call her that."
28064,they say no...But time will tell...I suppose Fauci will tell too
28065,How American.
28066,I’m from Adelaide Australia and yes we had a 3 day lockdown where you would be fined for walking your dog.
28067,But guess what?
28068,We have no locally acquired cases-0!
28069,I’d rather stay home for a few days than constantly worry about losing people I love just to maintain my rights
28070,"Right but the government of Florida knows their population is old and planning for that would fall under ""doing well""."
28071,Those death numbers are nothing but a failure
28072,You get the balance of community and free market right and the market place becomes bigger and more vibrant.
28073,"Unfortunately big business does not care about that - if they can get away with paying as little as possible for anything they will - wages, taxes."
28074,The fact that low wages means low spending that leads to less money making in the long run means nothing to a CEO on a short contract looking to maximise profits so they can get a big bonus.
28075,The USA needs to get up to 9M+ vaccinations *per week* if they want to look at reaching herd immunity by the end of 2021.
28076,What do you mean this variant is “no joke”?
28077,Please elaborate...
28078,I had to reread that before I remembered the context
28079,"You are as important as anyone else, just take it as soon as possible."
28080,"Sure, but initial estimates are 70% more transmissible."
28081,This who AZ debacle has been such an embarrassment for the UK.
28082,From MHRA giving them the go ahead on their magical dosing regimen to restarting a trial before thoroughly reviewing safety data... No amount of business website interviews Soroit does will change the fact their vaccine was poorly tested and their data is spotty at best.
28083,So I should just prepare for the worst then.
28084,Good thing I didn’t make any vacation plans until 2024...
28085,[deleted]
28086,"Yes - 18 years in live events, in a management position with many staff under me who are all currently stood down."
28087,It's not how I want things but life is more important.
28088,I can see you've made your mind up otherwise but you can clearly see you are in the minority judging by the downvotes.
28089,7 for places that are currently struggling with ICU beds and stuff.
28090,Only and still current defense for this is masking and social distancing.
28091,"Vaccine will also help, but the people doing the majority of the spreading won't have it."
28092,[removed]
28093,None of this is what I said.
28094,Apparently you just ignored my statement that if you've never had covid you should get vaccinated in order to make your straw man argument.
28095,ICUs are meant to usually run at 80-90% capacity because they are so expensive.
28096,"Also even during bad flu seasons, states like California have historically had to set up emergency field hospitals and care centers."
28097,Point is this is not a new problem nor is it specific to covid.
28098,This almost reads like she got punched in the face a SECOND time
28099,[removed]
28100,Yeah this is 100% not the first case of this in the US lmao it’s most likely been here for months
28101,[removed]
28102,I appreciate that.
28103,But I can work from home and meet clients over Zoom.
28104,There is no reason I should get the vaccine ahead of others my age.
28105,"If I were a bank teller or worked in a bank branch, it would be a different story."
28106,I do think those people should be getting the vaccine soon.
28107,They're being put at risk and we cannot shut bank branches down.
28108,"That really isn't a great rate, 700 per day, 1700 per day."
28109,"I know those are only a couple examples, but you need like 100k per day at least, will still take ten days for one million people."
28110,"&gt; On top of that, AZ did a weekly PCR test so it found a lot of people who were COVID positive but having no symptoms

Wasn't it rapid test?"
28111,For me is crazy that phase 3 study did not do antibodies tests for the approved vaccines during the trials.
28112,It is fair to assume there have been many asymptomatic cases but it also clear that vaccine is effective.
28113,Also we have to have in mind that AZ vaccine is 10 time cheaper than Pfizer.
28114,But the long notice is for giving independent expert the ability to give their view.
28115,That is the part the UK didn't do.
28116,One thing you have to look at is the death rate.
28117,We're at 1.5% with this disease.
28118,"If our next one is something like 10%, you're talking total collapse of infrastructure because nobody is going to work and put their life on the line to work in a grocery store, meat plant, ect.. That would make Covid-19 look like a day at Disneyland."

28125,Yeah I think this is what we are getting in LA .
28126,Yes people stop caring but people has stop caring since July (spike at 3-4k daily) .It went down to almost under 1k for both cases and hospitalization around October.
28127,"After thanksgiving, our cases pretty much explode to 14-15k a day with hospitalization at \~7k."
28128,"That should be a forfeit, no?"
28129,I heard the 2nd dose is when most side effects kick in.
28130,So it should be interesting next couple weeks.
28131,Hoping for the best...
28132,You really don’t get this concept at all do you.
28133,Yes kids have the option to distance learn.
28134,Teacher have prepared their lessons to be accessible to kids that are staying home.
28135,It’s not that complicated.
28136,"It’s likely been here for quite some time, only recently discovered because it’s been specifically tested for via sequencing."
28137,Carry on with all the precautions and get vaccinated as soon as you’re able.
28138,This doesn’t change much.
28139,Its likely inevitable if they're right that the variant is more easily spread.
28140,"Thankfully we don't have any data showing its more dangerous, looks like this variant may just eventually knock the current one off the top podium."
28141,"On the brighter side, this is common in the flu as they are usually picking between a handful of variants to target for particular season's flu vaccine."
28142,Also don't forget that if we don't know this one is more dangerous then we also don't know if its less dangerous.
28143,Similar mutations actually popped up towards the end of the SARS outbreak and they found it made the virus much less dangerous.
28144,"Logically it makes sense, a virus would be more successful if it becomes less deadly and more virulent."
28145,Well that's not how it works...
28146,Something about the new strain.
28147,"Nobody knows for sure one way or another on the vaccine, but initial statements have been positive."
28148,"But if we dont get our shit together and this thing impacts our hospitalizations, you can guarantee that there will be more stay at home restrictions until the vaccine has reached a large percentage of the population....which we are currently failing at."
28149,this isn't true with the advent of bacteriophages and new antibiotics
28150,"We know they're not, that's been reported for quite a while, the UK takes and preserves far more samples than the US and so had samples to identify the strain further back, letting them know how long it has been around there."
28151,If we had such sampling I'm positive we'd find the US has had it around well before Christmas.
28152,[removed]
28153,Yes.
28154,"Measles would be a better example, although it's several times more infectious and attacks the immune system so not a perfect metaphor."
28155,My workplace just got approved to distribute the vaccine.
28156,I'm so ready for this to finally start to die down.
28157,So would I and I do live here.
28158,:-)   (I don't even have health insurance.
28159,Haven't had all month.
28160,Not by choice or my fault.
28161,Some guy died.
28162,His daughter contacted the insurance company to cancel his ins.
28163,Someone keyed in a wrong number/letter and the cancellation went to my account !
28164,--I found out and contacted them on 12-19.
28165,It's still not fixed... Last supervisor I talked to this evening is working on it and hopes it gets fixed in the next 2 days.
28166,-- Told me not to worry.
28167,"If I need healthcare, get it and they'll take care of bills later."
28168,Now it's a race between vaccination and the spread of this new variant.
28169,Let's all hope the spike proteins the vaccines target don't change significantly.
28170,I'm the only lockdown skeptic in my family of 4.
28171,And I'm the only one actually following the rules.
28172,"My sister and parents are constantly seeing friends, having dinners with other people, etc etc."
28173,"I have not gone anywhere except for work, gas station or grocery store in months except for a couple trips to our large and mostly empty regional parks."
28174,I have been doing this mostly for the sake of my almost 70 year old dad.
28175,But every day I get closer and closer to my breaking point.
28176,If I were living on my own I would not be doing things the same way.
28177,"Even funnier, they think I'm crazy that I support the recall of our idiot governor because I disapprove of his endless rules, which they support and I don't, and I'm following and they aren't."
28178,“We” aren’t ready because people like you don’t understand fucking science.
28179,"No, I got it."
28180,I just wanted to tell more of the story.
28181,Purely fear mongering lol
28182,"So I looked at both, and I can't find what shows causality."
28183,"&amp;#x200B;

it would greatly help me if you can identify what in them you think shows that."
28184,"&amp;#x200B;

Thanks in advance."
28185,It’s generally 14 days minimum to get the body to make enough antibodies to have minimum protection against viruses.
28186,"imo, vaccine rates will increase as two additional vaccinations are approved in the coming months (Johnson and Johnson and AstraZeneca), and rates will increase as the process hastens with experience."
28187,"Infection rates may very well continue to increase in some areas, while other areas will hit their peak sooner and plateau."
28188,That rate will be based more on a local scale.
28189,We may see a slowing of infection rates as we approach 30% immunity via natural infection or vaccination.
28190,"Hopefully, at that point, the situation will be less dire for hospitals and deaths/infections will decrease."
28191,"This is going to lead to hotspots everywhere, and annihilate our medical system.."
28192,Did I say that?
28193,"I was answering the ignorant question of ""Who cares"" not ""What public health measures need to stay in place until we develop a means of reducing spread of the virus."""

28272,The problem is with obesity.

28274,It’s their job to protect themselves.
28275,Not ours.

28311,"5000iu 
10,000iu

28338,"""Infect others""

It's their responsibility to get vaccinated too

""Have symptoms"" 

Maybe?"
28339,"It should be able to completely shut down the virus having any effect, but even if it does minor symptoms for a day is a MUCH better alternative."
28340,"""wear a mask/socially distance""

In addition to what I said earlier, it's a courtesy thing."
28341,"People don't know someone is vaccinated so it's best to just wear a mask to not freak others out


But, to answer your question in a much simpler form ""Because you are much less likely to get it and people won't die as much"""
28342,"Lol, this sub was saying there was no way we would be vaccinating people until next year, and now we may have close to 5 million people vaccinated by the end of the year, and yall are complaining..."
28343,Maybe the problem is all the restrictions on business loans?
28344,"Just maybe...

Point is let's talk about the real problem."

28351,Months?
28352,Feels like a year
28353,What about polio?
28354,It kills 1 in 200 cases.
28355,"I don't think you can skip vaccination if you visit Africa, Afghanistan, or Pakistan."
28356,"We give 100M flu shots in this country, annually."
28357,Most of that happens in about 3 months.
28358,We most definitely have the people to do basic injections.
28359,The limiting factor is vaccine production and distribution.
28360,Well good thing I never mentioned the CCP.
28361,There's some evidence that having the virus leads to immunity (and it probably does) but it's not definitively proven yet and vaccine immunity could last longer so it makes sense for the moment to vaccinate those who've already had it.
28362,Agreed.
28363,I never said it wouldn't incease: just that there are plenty of reasons the growth won't be exponential.
28364,The j&amp;j and oxford/astrazeneca are both very significant additions to the armoury against Covid19.
28365,"If we are going to talk statistics, then I guess you know that the chance of contracting Covid is much less when wearing the appropriate mask and sanatizing."
28366,"I'm not arguing about logic and all that but you are not taking into account the fact that statistically, healthy people do not exist in the grand scheme of things."
28367,"Also, just because you survive Covid does not mean you are exempt of the consequences."

28394,without full knowledge of all the details I won’t say they shouldn’t receive the funds.
28395,But the question is should they?
28396,If they have large cash reserves it seems like they should tap into those in a time of emergency like now.
28397,I work for a small non-profit in the healthcare industry obviously impacted by the pandemic like most.
28398,Our owner applied and was approved for a PPP loan back in March or whenever the CARES act was passed.
28399,He reevaluate the companies finances including cash reserves and determined that we would be able to be okay so he turned down the loan.
28400,A lot of businesses are suffering so I seriously question any business that has cash reserves and doesn’t tap into them.
28401,Can you cite some actual evidence to support what you are saying?
28402,What dosages are we talking about here.
28403,"Many, many people take vitamin d with absolutely no side affects."
28404,"We are talking about a moderate dose here, not mass quantities."
28405,"I think you are describing vitamin d toxicity, for which you would need an extremely high dose over a long period of time."

28407,Lol every time!
28408,"“Trrk drr grrns!”

28409,I can’t wait until it is considered too elementary to be taken seriously.
28410,I didn't expect it either haha
28411,"Honestly I’ll settle for being able to leave the house at all (high risk, I’ve left the house 5 times since March)."
28412,they didn't choose that location.
28413,they had no other choice.
28414,Well good thing I never said they didn’t... doesn’t mean this sub and reddit isn’t flooded with CCP stooges.
28415,So if the “anti science” organization has influence over its antiscience adherents wouldn’t we want them to promote vaccines to the people who would be the least likely to pandemic well due to their scientific skepticism?
28416,"Everyone owns their performance, or lack thereof."
28417,Including China.
28418,That is all I am saying.
28419,Trying to make China's response seem better by deflecting to all the flaws USA made is just polishing a turd.
28420,I’m just not that political my friend..I doubt I could hang with you in that conversation.
28421,BLM isn’t doing anything for black lives IMO.
28422,If you would care to talk about why I feel that way and take the politics out of the conversation then let me know.
28423,Fear mongering.
28424,Stop fear mongering.
28425,For me it's somehow both.
28426,The longest year of my life and it's just flown by.
28427,It's just been a wild ride.
28428,I’m sure there are still idiots with mountains of toilet paper...
28429,"What is it about the vaccine that makes you ""fully"" trust it?"
28430,"I'm optimistic it will work and plan on taking it if no issues crop up before it's available, but fully trusting it seems as bullheaded as fully distrusting it, from my perspective."
28431,Hell yeah
28432,Has there been any discussion on what counts as a preexisting condition?
28433,Does chron’s disease count?
28434,"I'm not following, vaccine only teaches your body how to fight the virus when you inhale it again, getting an actual virus teaches your body how to fight the virus  when you inhale it again."
28435,Vaccine doesn't prevent virus inhalation.
28436,Or do you mean to just boost your immunity memory against the virus since it only lasts maybe 9 months.
28437,Taiwan had a successful strategy: do not believe China.
28438,The country of Taiwan is evidently credible.

28440,?
28441,"He's not talking about covid, he's talking about a theoretical worse scenario that he thinks people would still downplay."
28442,Staffing?
28443,It’s my understanding it is not just the physical space of a bed.
28444,"There may be a bed for a patient to lie in, but if the staff trained to care for the patient has been decimated...?"
28445,"For instance, if one nurse per shift is required for each ICU patient (so, two nurses if working 12 hour shifts) and half of the staff is unable to work, that would mean only half of the patients could be cared for, or sub-standard care because one nurse would be splitting time among two patients."
28446,"This is just throwing out numbers, but I’m sure there is plenty of analysis noting a point of diminished patient outcomes when staffing is thin."
28447,"Every patient who walks out alive is really is a testament to the healthcare workers who are working consecutive, extended shifts with a greater patient load than is standard."
28448,"They are all heroes, miracle workers and saints."
28449,"Went yesterday, doctor gave me an Rx for an antibiotic because I’m 99% certain it’s a bladder infection (I feel the exact same way last time I had one 5 years ago) but he said my symptoms mimic covid which is weird because other than nausea and malaise (also symptoms of a bladder infection) I don’t have any."
28450,"To be fair, we won’t see any noticeable affect on cases until the general public starts being able to be vaccinated."
28451,"We should, hopefully, start seeing a decrease in hospitalizations and deaths over the next month or two since nursing home residents are now starting to get vaccinated."
28452,Perhaps that is a sign of incompetent leadership?
28453,Maybe?
28454,"Better be March, tbh."
28455,That was when the shitshow reeled in.
28456,"Umm, because children’s hospitals also have ICU beds."
28457,"Don’t worry, the new strain will ensure those get put to use."

28460,Anyone here a bit annoyed that the nurse isn't using PPE when doing that injection?
28461,Thank you.
28462,"The only thing I could do was go home right away after I sobered up in the morning, and self isolating in my room and monitoring for symptoms"
28463,The media is guilty of this tho.
28464,"Hell, that NYT article compares the 78% December occupancy to 2010’s full year average of 67%... they should at least compare December to December."
28465,"*figures never lie, but liars figure*"
28466,If the idea is to get widespread willingness of people to take it then honestly it sounds weird but figureheads with influence should be getting it earlier rather than later.
28467,In my experience Catholics tend to be followers of the direct advice of their leaders.
28468,"""I'll be a living God!"""
28469,"-Maragaret, probably"
28470,"Why are we still flying around the world, remind me please?"
28471,Seriously.
28472,People need to ask this question.
28473,"That's borderline impossible, mrna doesn't affect DNA at all, it's just a code which tells the cell to build a specific protein."
28474,It’s really just so OP that COVID can spread in presymtomatic or asymptomatic people.
28475,That makes the counterplay extremely broad and generalized: you have no clue who could be spreading it so we have to assume everyone has it.
28476,Please nerf.
28477,Change it so that it only spreads when symptoms manifest.
28478,That's not an apples to apples comparison at all though.
28479,Kids aren't disproportionally affected by gun violence.
28480,"In fact, they make up a tiny percentage of all gun violence deaths."
28481,"I'm both a gun owner and open to some increased restrictions, but conflating mass shootings and overall gun violence is one of the dumbest things the left has done."
28482,They are two different problems with completely different solutions.
28483,Then the media needs to do a better job dumbing it down.
28484,Clearly in the case of California they decided to go for clicks instead.
28485,"If you see comments that you think break the rules, just report them or send a modmail please."
28486,Public callouts don’t help anyone.
28487,"Once the vaccines are procured the rate of vaccination has nothing to do with who is president, its not gonna magically speed up on Jan 20."
28488,We're in the exponential growth phase of a logistic curve.
28489,"There's a reporting lag so we are probably at 3 or 4 million, likely will be at 6 or 7 on new years day."
28490,I personally think it’s California already..
28491,I don’t think they’re tracking it as well as they are in Europe.
28492,Once again WHO steps in to boost confidence in its infinite wisdom about Covid...at the worst possible time just as vaccines are beginning to be deployed.
28493,has anything changed though?
28494,The media loves to push dirty laundry
28495,Ok then.
28496,"Here is what we have

Choice A - we do nothing, continue to isolate or return to normal, let the virus rip through the population and kill hundreds of thousands more."
28497,"Oh, and those that do survive may have long term effects."
28498,"After all, as you said, it’s a new virus."
28499,Choice B - we aggressively vaccinate everyone and avoid all of that except possibly some long term effects that the experts believe do not exist.
28500,I’ll take choice B
28501,"&gt; life long immunity you get from chicken pox

Is this even true?"
28502,I thought chicken pox was like other herpes viruses in that it hides out in your nerve cells and is never really removed from your body.
28503,You can even have recurrences of it (shingles).
28504,I saw Cross-Diaspora at the Christian Rock Tent at Lollapalooza
28505,I don't doubt that kids are more valuable.
28506,"If push came to shove, would you save an 80 year old or 8 year given equal circumstances."
28507,I think the answer is pretty simple.
28508,Just it came across as people don't care because elderly aren't important enough to care to even try.
28509,At least it feels that way.
28510,Coventry ftw
28511,Colorado governor just confirmed The variant is here.
28512,Quite sad yes but we cannot put things on hold forever for a very small percentage of people
28513,I came to the US when I was 5 (30 years ago) from the Philippines.
28514,"Shit, I remember I got a handful of vaccinations the first week in the US."
28515,And many more a few years after that.
28516,I hated it and I wanted to go back lol.
28517,I thought the US was cruel for doing that to all kids.
28518,"Anyway, I kind to want to know the data of how many immigrants are anti vaxxers, I’m sure there cannot be that much because we all had to get vaccinated and we’re doing just fine."
28519,"""Who cares"" 

Epidemiologists and people who can't be vaccinated."
28520,What is the point?
28521,"I am in Los Angeles and I can report freeway traffic is almost as bad as before covid hit, malls are busy."
28522,No one is staying at home.
28523,This is nothing but stay at home in name only
28524,I'm sure I'll get a vaccine before any major movies even release at this rate lol

28540,oh wow good points!
28541,It WOULD be a legitimate question if it were only new.
28542,But it's not.
28543,The mRNA process has been in dev since SARS and we used the research from that to speed things immensely.
28544,Not to mention the vaccine is merely provoking your immune system to produce antibodies to the proteins of coronavirus.
28545,The likelihood of long term effects is basically zero.

28571,"I’m personally pretty confident with it as most vaccines don’t happen to have significant long term effects, especially in this situations where getting covid and recovering can be much worse  for your organs than whatever a vaccines side effects will be."
28572,That’s just my perspective.

28575,My lungs feel like shit.
28576,My body broke out in hives.
28577,"Even though I have asthma, when I cough it's different this time, like my ribcage sucks all the air in and coughs as hard as possible."
28578,I have a fever that at one point got to 102.8 degrees.
28579,"When I first started getting symptoms, my nose was congested, even though there was no mucus."
28580,My face felt like someone hit me with a baseball bat and my head felt like it had a mild concussion.
28581,"I don't know how else to really describe it, but I felt like I was there but not really there."

Then the headache and pressure disapated and it manifested more in my lungs and blood vessels."
28584,Last night I woke up with my hands and feet swelling.

28592,I live in a neighboring county and I can assure you we were taking excess from the closest hospitals until we reached max capacity as well
28593,Thats the most toxic sub ever
28594,Right so we don't know.
28595,"Realistically, probably not, but erring on the side of caution is the smart approach right now."
28596,"No, i just thought most kids had teachers preparing things for them and doing the work, I didn’t realize you full on homeschooled your kids."
28597,Right.
28598,"It doesn’t apply to everyone, but we still have nearly 2 million dead worldwide."
28599,The vaccine stops the pandemic.
28600,It’s not just about you and your individual risk (which is super small) from the vaccine.
28601,This article is from March and is over 9 months old.
28602,[removed]
28603,"Vaccination rate skyrockets, and we totally knew it all along hehe yup we did, told you so."
28604,;) ;)
28605,Once my parents and sister get the first vaccine...I'll be there.
28606,Were done mitigating then.
28607,[removed]
28608,Is this an actual sentence?
28609,"There are a LOT of Walgreens, my friend."
28610,And a lot of hospitals.
28611,And most of all a lot of Urgency.
28612,You are worried about people waiting in line to get a vaccine causing cases to explode when you should be wishing and hoping people get in line to take the shot - that is how cases stop spreading entirely.
28613,In the US we vaccinate millions and millions of people in regular business.
28614,"The infrastructure is there, it is just a matter of figuring it out."
28615,If there was no limitation on supply we could administer the shots to everyone in a couple weeks.
28616,The rules around who gets it first is the only thing causing undue delays.
28617,More manufacturing and more experience will drop that hurdle.
28618,The bottom line is to not look at the first week as use that to forecast the future.
28619,"At the start of November, I signed up as interested in taking part in both the J&amp;J and AZ US studies (obviously, was only going to participate in one study based on who found me eligible)."
28620,"J&amp;J enrolled me at their New Jersey location two weeks later, AZ's local partner called me but said they could only book my appointment the second week of January ""because of the holidays"", so I opted out of that one."
28621,"The required timeframe is collecting data until it's two months after the median enrollee in their study gets their shot (plus time to do analysis + FDA review), so maybe my local site is unusually slow and they're already more than half enrolled, but I do know that they're still enrolling people well into next month which, which could put potentially put their submission date in March and approval in April."
28622,Right because the goverments that are destroying the world currently.
28623,Will not try to force or coerce the rest of the population to take it.
28624,"That is unbareably naive

28625,"Yesss come to the ""dark"" rational side."
28626,":) We have indoor dining, movies, gathering with friends and family, and fun."
28627,I'm absolutely terrified of needles.
28628,"Like, as a teenager I would throw up when I had to get blood work done."
28629,"Still, for vaccinations or other important stuff you just grit your teeth, look away or shut your eyes, and go to your happy place for 30 seconds."
28630,If you suck all the money out of the education system and have parents that have to work 2-3 jobs just to keep a roof over head and food on the table.
28631,What do you expect to happen ?
28632,It seems the USA has been deliberately dumbing down it’s population for the last 30 years.
28633,Add the miss information supplied by the likes of Tucker Carlson on Fox News and a President happy to lie to people to get them to go back to spending money.
28634,Actually lets be honest here.
28635,"First we were told 100m, then 40m, then 20m."
28636,And now we aren't gonna hit the 20m.
28637,I think people are right to feel disappointed
28638,damn poors and all their international travel
28639,I realize that.
28640,To add to what I said above here's a [direct link](https://www.latimes.com/newsletters/todays-headlines) to sign up for the LA Times newsletter.
28641,"I guess that I should add that there are a great number of cases where a site is accessible from a regular computer, desk or laptop,  but inaccessible from a cell phone"
28642,It was obvious we were already in it.
28643,Look at the numbers compared to the last wave.
28644,God works in mysterious ways
28645,"Our politicians have lots of vested interests in businesses so they out-sourced the contact tracing, which failed."
28646,"The tier system is confusing, many of the rules make no sense, air travel allowed, mask wearing in shops wasn't mandated for ages and when the pandemic began we pursued herd immunity before realising what a mistake that was."
28647,"Furthermore, the schools and universities have become virus hotspots and our most recent ""lockdown"" in November saw schools and universities remain open."
28648,In short: incompetence and corruption is why we're in this mess.
28649,[removed]
28650,Because british ok would may be open door to India with large production capacities.
28651,"Well if you *feel* like its over exaggerated, that's enough evidence for me."
28652,Hoax!
28653,No no no... burn the media...  FTFY
28654,She also voted for Biden.
28655,I don’t think you understand phobias.
28656,They are phobias because they are irrational.
28657,A garter snake won’t harm you but I know a lot of people who would run from one when doing that yard work.
28658,This is completely false.
28659,The CDC suggestion (being followed by most states) is to provide the vaccine concurrently to old people and “essential workers” (of which there are an estimated 30-40 million).
28660,"Deaths won’t stop until we can vaccinate all of the 70+ individuals, and that won’t happen until most of the 30-40 million essential workers have been vaccinated as well."
28661,"A few states (Texas, Florida, etc.)"
28662,"ignored the CDC and will see deaths drop off quickly, but for the other states it will take months."
28663,Lol exactly.
28664,NO ONE CAN SEE FAMILY EVER AGAIN CAUSE KATHY HAS AN AUTOIMMUNE DISEASE DOWN THE BLOCK
28665,The UK primarily placed their bets on the AZ vaccine and ordered significantly more of that vaccine than any other.
28666,The UK balked at the chance to order more of the Moderna and Pfizer vaccines when given the chance and now are incredibly reliant on the AZ vaccine being approved if they want their population vaccinated in any reasonable period of time.
28667,"If the MHRA were to reject AZ’s vaccine for Emergency Use, UK residents vaccination schedules would be delayed for months."
28668,So now the MHRA is in the awkward position of granting emergency use authorization for a vaccine that does meet standards or denying the UK the vaccines it so desperately needs probably resulting in tens of thousands of deaths.
28669,Poor planning on the UKs part and overly nationalistic pride in it’s quite frankly lackluster vaccine development capabilities has put this apolitical body in the awkward position of making up for political mistakes by compromising its adherence to safety and ethical standards.
28670,Poltical decisions affect apolitical bodies all the time.
28671,Got my first Pfizer jab today!
28672,Expectations were set poorly.
28673,Earlier this month we were told to expect 40mm doses distributed in the USA.
28674,It's going to be not even half that at best.
28675,"Yes, we all know that the current rate won't hold."
28676,So what is the next clickbait headline after it increases?
28677,This is completely false.
28678,The CDC suggestion (being followed by most states) is to provide the vaccine concurrently to old people and “essential workers” (of which there are an estimated 30-40 million).
28679,"Deaths won’t stop until we can vaccinate all of the 70+ individuals, and that won’t happen until most of the 30-40 million essential workers have been vaccinated as well."
28680,"A few states (Texas, Florida, etc.)"
28681,"ignored the CDC and will see deaths drop off quickly, but for the other states it will take months."
28682,Definitely not.
28683,EU level bureaucracy fucking sucks.
28684,I’ve submitted EU level applications in corporate settings and the red tape is insane sometimes.
28685,I can completely understand why they may find it easier to do emergency approvals in certain individual countries before submitting data to the EU.
28686,Chances are the submissions to the EU are 10 times harder to gather data for and comply with.
28687,"Not that this is wrong, there should be strict protocols, but the EU has never ever ever been one for reducing bureaucracy."
28688,So I have a feeling here AZ are not the ones to blame for the delay.
28689,Just my guess based off my experience.
28690,"Sure, I agree."
28691,But tgat doesn't mean we shoudl not be able to discuss the potential risks of doing it this way.
28692,But I was banned from this subreddit by the mods for 15 because I tried to post a link that gave truthful information about the vaccine that cautioned about the risks.
28693,"I was labeled an anti vaxxer  by the mods of this subreddit even though I am absolutely pro vaccine 
I even had a vaccine shot last week  for tetanus, polio etc."
28694,"Oh, it's definitely weird."
28695,I jump in just because he's wife is always funny about it.
28696,"She'll answer, ""Hahahahahahahaha hahahahahahaha...no"" or in a Wayne's World style, ""That sounds like a great idea...NOT!"""
28697,I bet it is.
28698,"In my area like every where else, since October its just exploded."
28699,I live in a very small area too.
28700,[removed]
28701,"Oh I getcha I still wear my masks but I understand the burnout that could cause the ""who cares"" vibe"
28702,Im sure it all over with how much its spreading.
28703,What an absolutely ABYSMAL headline.
28704,There is quite literally zero chance that rates dont keep improving every single week.
28705,"God damnit the media fucking sucks and is enough to turn someone like me, who is trying to mitigate, into a full blown fuck it burn my mask person."
28706,This is NOT how we get people on board with public health measures.
28707,Fear and shaming doesnt do shit but the opposite.
28708,Vaccination is following a logistic curve.
28709,It will not take 10 years.
28710,This is a brain dead headline from a publisher who KNOWS better but wants the clickbait appeal.
28711,"Your state’s Department of Health sets the priorities for vaccination, so check with them to find the current vaccination plan."
28712,"


“You are infinity more likely to die from COVID than the vaccine and *850 times more likely to die from COVID than have a non-lethal allergic reaction*”

This is the part where I have an issue with."
28713,I am not 850 times more likely to die from COVID than have a non-lethal allergic reaction.
28714,And neither are you.
28715,And neither are my parents.
28716,"This number doesn’t apply to anyone, but it’s being stated like it applies to everyone."
28717,"And there’s also the fact that they used CFR, which obviously massively undercounts the total number of infections and therefore doesn’t show the true risk of someone actually dying from COVID"
28718,His whole point is that usa is still worse even if they didn't only lie about 500k...

28790,She fell and needed to go back to the hospital when things were just getting bad around March or April and my mom thinks it was the isolation that killed her.
28791,We weren’t able to visit in person due to COVID precautions and simply not having a familiar face around her to reassure her she will be fine is part of the reason we believe she lost her will to survive.
28792,It’s extremely hard for a person with late stages of dementia to be left alone for extended periods of time in unfamiliar(and scary) territories like a hospital is.

28804,Seems like being the Vice President of the United States warrants some protection beyond the typical 50-some year old.
28805,Black Americans are also less likely to express a willingness to get vaccinated and this could help.
28806,You're also damned either way.
28807,"When the Pfizer CEO said he wasn't going to ""skip ahead"" out came a bunch of conspiracists who thought it was suspicious."
28808,The government strongly advocating a vaccine they aren't taking themselves is cause for skepticism for many.

28811,"But also if he lied, why didn’t Trump call him out and tell everyone to wear a mask?"
28812,I’m so confused
28813,We aren’t even close to managing this one.
28814,"A highly contagious virus with a high death rate across all ages, with no treatment or vaccine, will tear through the world unimpeded."
28815,"We knew what needed to be done early on to stop the transmission of this virus, we didn’t do it."
28816,"We knew we could have developed an effective anti-viral and had that ready for a treatment for this virus, we didn’t put money behind it."
28817,I don’t think we will have much preparation for the next viral outbreak outside of maybe wearing masks and washing hands.
28818,"Maybe we will limit travel early in the outbreak, but I doubt it."
28819,Also true.
28820,Seems there are just gaps of info in the article that would aid in understanding.
28821,The vaccine is being strategically given to the cogs in the machine so that revenue can still be generated and those that receive the benefits can still live their lavish life.
28822,"Holy cow, that's interesting."
28823,"For reference, Illinois is slightly more populous than Sweden."
28824,"Illinois had 5,644 cases today and 106 deaths."

28826,"But telling someone who has anxiety over needles and shots ""that it's easy, it doesn't hurt at all"" is like trying to tell someone with depression to ""just don't be sad""."
28827,Present the science
28828,"uh, I never said that ""everybody who gets covid will die or have long term ailments."""
28829,YOU said that.
28830,All I said is that covid carries a risk of these things that is demonstrated to be much much much higher than the vaccine.
28831,The fact that you would rather be forcefully infected with covid instead of getting a vaccine is just hilarious and would make any covid doctor or nurse laugh in your face.
28832,Pure Darwinism.
28833,You're doing the lord's work lmao.
28834,Also I love how you've twisted your whole argument into it being a matter of social distancing and isolation.
28835,"yes, you're right that isolating yourself is safer than vaccine or covid, but that wasn't your original point."
28836,It sounds like you have one of those lifestyles where you can continue living your life without socializing.
28837,that's not the case for most people.
28838,"oh gawd, and your comparison to a car shop/mechanic situation is so laughable and stupid...you KNOW that taking your car to a mechanic doesn't compare at all to the situation that the entire world is facing."
28839,this conversation has made me stupider.
28840,don't reply.
28841,It’s a different type of demanding.
28842,It’s hard to explain.
28843,In a big city there is an expectation that things will take a while and that if we can’t fix it we will refer you on.
28844,In rural town they expect you to do everything the second they want it done.
28845,People in the city can be like this too but in the end I don’t give a shit.
28846,It’s a big city and if you aren’t happy you will just go somewhere else and even if you do complain no one really cares.

29127,"The NYT and Reuters each ran articles that were heavily critical of how AZ has handled the trials:

[https://www.nytimes.com/2020/12/08/business/covid-vaccine-oxford-astrazeneca.html](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/12/08/business/covid-vaccine-oxford-astrazeneca.html)

[https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-health-coronavirus-britain-vaccine-sp/special-report-how-a-british-covid-19-vaccine-went-from-pole-position-to-troubled-start-idUKKBN28Y0Y5](https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-health-coronavirus-britain-vaccine-sp/special-report-how-a-british-covid-19-vaccine-went-from-pole-position-to-troubled-start-idUKKBN28Y0Y5)

That said, the vaccine is probably safe and at least 60% effective."
29128,I hope the UK approves it asap because they really need it.
29129,"But the more I read about this, the more it looks like AZ ran the trials rather poorly and they are cherry-picking data amongst subgroups to get headlines about higher efficacy."
29130,What's a mental health?
29131,"Here’s what Moderna has to say in that article:

“Do I believe that it reduces transmission?"
29132,"Absolutely yes, and I say this because of the science,” he added."
29133,"“But absent proof, I think it’s important that we don’t change behaviors solely on the basis of vaccination.”

That’s very different from what you said in your original comment."
29134,This isn’t rocket science.
29135,It doesn’t sound too good to be true.
29136,"If my county of 360,000 people (of whom currently 300 test Covid positive a day) was all willing to stop moving around for 3 weeks while the government tested all of them (and twice or more for the ones who tested positive) we would cease to have 300 cases a day."
29137,China brought their baseline extremely low through brutal means and then pounced on anything that popped up after the fact.
29138,"Are their numbers bs, sure in the beginning but they currently seem to be taking a zero tolerance approach coupled with a response of overwhelming focused testing."
29139,My friend says their population is very cooperative as well.
29140,During their lockdown there were citizen brigades disinfecting the streets with foggers and doing temperature check stations before getting back into your apartment complex.
29141,He showed me a picture from his apartment complex of residents setting up package depot tents (that they voluntarily manned) so that delivery people didn’t go into and in between 100 different apartment buildings a day and people could come outside to pick up their alibabba deliveries.
29142,Maybe just maybe they had a different outcome because they handled it differently.
29143,"States are also reporting they are getting shorted on vaccines, so no still incompetent leadership."
29144,What about William Shakespeare?
29145,?
29146,I just got back from my “90 day” AZ check up which is more like 130 day due to the pause.
29147,"I find that the nurses and doctors are a bit liberal and all over with how they are updating us as patients, because my mom and I get different information despite being in the same trial."
29148,"Today my doctor told me AZ expects final results in the trial by the end of this week or next, with (obviously hopeful) EUA approval end of January."
29149,They told my mom they are hopeful AZ approves everyone who got the placebo to be given the shot ASAP after.
29150,"Please note my experience has varied with what they tell me each time I go in, I am in no way privy to much more info than the public aside from what they tell me directly."
29151,You can’t possibly argue that no one cares about their safety when going to a store.
29152,"If there are several reviews saying people got food poisoning at a restaurant, fewer people are going to go there."
29153,"If a bowling alley is in a sketchy area and there’s another bowling alley in a nicer area, people are going to go to the nicer one."
29154,"You can argue that there are people who would get the vaccine, but would protest stores that require proof of the vaccine out of principle."
29155,"I can arguing that people who are concerned about their health are more likely to go to the stores that require a vaccine - when my sister had to fly home from college at the beginning of the pandemic, we definitely used the companies’ safety protocols to decide which one to send her on."
29156,"You can argue all you want that more people value their principles over their safety, and therefore more people will be boycotting vaccine-requiring stores than vice versa, but you cannot possibly say that no one would intentionally choose vaccine-requiring stores because they want to be safe."
29157,"I'm happy for her and all of the other people who have received their vaccinations, unlike someone I dearly love who treats covid patients every day yet won't receive the first shot until ""sometime after January 11."""
29158,Only a handful of the nurses and doctors working within this not to be named US system and who are treating covid patients have received their first shot.
29159,Can you tell that I am furious?
29160,New Zealanders in UK should remain in UK
29161,"Without actually having seen any statistics on this my guess is that it comes down to either of these things:

1) It's implemented too late when the spread is already too great (the infection largely spreads at home where people aren't wearing face masks and if many people already have the virus it will inevitably spread between family members)."
29162,2) There are loopholes to the implementation.
29163,Where I work e.g.
29164,we wear face mask when performing our regular tasks but still eat together in a small space.
29165,"In general, people might wear face masks outside but still come in contact with people in their work environment e.g., catch the virus and bring it home."
29166,"There are also places in which face masks may or may not have been a contributing factor for lessening the spread of the virus, such as many Asian countries."
29167,"So France, Spain and Italy probably made the mistake of recommending masks when the spread was already out of hand."
29168,"Whether or not it will be effective in Sweden or not at this point is uncertain, but I'm sure it will probably matter on an ""individual basis""."
29169,"Some people will probably avoid infection thanks to others' use of face masks, but if there will be a statistical difference I'm not so sure about."
29170,Possibly if done right.
29171,Typical anti-vaxer is not the same as someone who doesn’t want this particular vaccine.
29172,"Loads of people have MMR for example, but won’t take this"
29173,"Which suggests that while ""too much individualism"" is a factor, at least in the States, it's not the only one."
29174,I’d love to
29175,This comment will age really poorly
29176,Is this backlog from Xmas period?
29177,Or have they bee increasing daily cases over past week?
29178,Today is the day i expect the US to catch up on some backlog.
29179,I could be a dark day
29180,"we're absolutely not getting everyone vaccinated by march, we don't have enough vaccines."
29181,They were talking about 4 million by april.
29182,"Sorry but time is relative, man only divides it into segments."
29183,Nothing changes at the stroke of midnight Dec 31st.
29184,"Likewise, friend."
29185,Yep exact same.
29186,I even had customers complaining about not being able to hear me
29187,Dumb fucks like you should have to come with me on Covid ICU rounds.
29188,"Heck, I won't even trample your ""rights"" by making you wear a mask if you don't want."
29189,Asshole.
29190,Just waiting for the quote where fauci admits to lying.
29191,I don’t think what he did was a lie.
29192,"And if he did, why didn’t America start wearing a mask."
29193,I’m so confused what the point of “fauci lied” really is.
29194,Most people accusing him won’t be wearing masks anyways.
29195,It’s all bullshit.
29196,Fair enough.
29197,I think i just felt petty because I honestly just didn’t want them there to begin with.
29198,But the not wearing masks part was what pushed me to actually call and complain.
29199,"It's just a cloth mask, you can buy them here for very cheaply, loads of people selling them all over."
29200,But you're quite right that it should be free for all.
29201,Cool because as an American I see jab and think why would you punch a little old lady.
29202,No fuck off.
29203,Shakespeare
29204,My state/county are botching the vaccine distribution so badly and I am so angry.
29205,"I'm high-risk so I've been staying almost exclusively inside my apartment for almost a full year (along with every other sensible person), but Governor Deathsentence has decided once again to put money over his own people and doesn't seem to have any real plan on getting vaccines to people that need it the most (like healthcare workers)."
29206,"All he gives a shit about is that sweet snowbird coin and everyone is starting to notice, as they should."
29207,Having healthcare workers line up outside free-for-all vaccination clinics for 12+ hours along with the over-65 crowd is COMPLETELY unacceptable.
29208,"I'm so glad to be getting away from this hell state in March (moving to DC area), but our governor isn't going to make this next few months easy for me, or more importantly, frontline healthcare and essential workers."
29209,"I am trying to stay optimistic, but it's really hard when every step of the way things get so completely fucked up and it's so clearly ALL about profit."
29210,"I get that age is a major risk factor, but I'm hearing so many people say that not even workers OR residents at assisted living facilities or even people in emergency medical settings who have regular contact with COVID patients have gotten this vaccine....yet we're just rolling it out to every over-65 that wants it (including snowbirds that only live in FL 2-3 months out of the entire year and are down here now in larger numbers than ever because we have NO restrictions, and they will obviously die if they don't eat at restaurants or go to bars!)"
29211,and making them wait in 12 hour lines along with healthcare workers with no guarantee that they'll even get one of the \~300 vaccines?
29212,"I don't see much coverage of this around (and really FL is just a microcosm of the botched US response up to this point), but the lack of planning (even a BASIC site to pre-register/make an appointment) and the governor's refusal to follow basic instructions from the CDC because it impacts FL's bottom line is an absolute disgrace."
29213,I just wanted to shout my frustration into the void.
29214,"I feel like governments like the US would probably still react like this, as long as the people at the top of society are able to make themselves safe."
29215,"If there seemed to be any possibility that you could just let the thing go until herd immunity was reached, many governments would just sit around making excuses thinking that it's surely going to peak any day now."
29216,"The only way they get to the point where dissent isn't tolerated is if it somehow threatens the wealthy and politicians - then expect full lockdown with martial law in a snap of the fingers, and see how much the government actually cares about ""rights"" and ""freedom""."

Literally one of Hundreds of results that show up, All of them from reputed media"
29219,sounds like these communities made their own bed.
29220,Field hospitals aren’t being used because they don’t help when you don’t have any more healthcare workers who by the way are under extreme amounts of psychological stress from the pandemic.
29221,Didn't she turn into a zombie?
29222,Misinformation.
29223,Transmission is expected to be reduced and even the former FDA head expects transmission to be nonexistent after vaccination.
29224,Moderna had promising data showing reduced transmission.
29225,"Came here for Shakespeare references, found one."
29226,Alas poor yorick in gna jerk off and go to bed.
29227,I am not wrong and the data is all there for you to see if you care to look.
29228,Flu season is about 3-4 months and in a bad year kills 60-70 thousand people which is about 20k per month.
29229,If it lasted all year it would kill 240k which is not far off from the 290k we have from Covid.
29230,Covid is more contagious than the flu and apparently does not have a season.
29231,"Additionally about half of the US takes the flu vaccine every year, its actual efficacy is debatable but it surely slows the spread somewhat."
29232,Treatment for the flu is also very well understood.
29233,Covid has neither a vaccine and up until recently did not have effective treatments.
29234,The declining fatality rate over the past few months is very likely due to improvements in recognizing and treating it.
29235,The health care system is overwhelmed because it has never had this many deaths in a year throughout the entire year.
29236,Many parts of the country are nowhere near equipped for this.
29237,Arizona has 1.9 hospital beds per 1000 residents which is absurdly low.
29238,I personally do not think that the lockdown measures are effective in at least half of the country.
29239,"When half of the people don't follow them they are useless, probably worse than nothing because they give people a false sense of security and they act recklessly."
29240,I am not sure what I am saying that you find so objectionable.
29241,My point is just that the infection fatality rate of Covid is not very high but because of its persistence and lack of treatments it is a serious health issue.
29242,But it is not serious because of its fatality rate.
29243,[deleted]
29244,Thanks for proving OP's point.
29245,"Serious question: so if someone positive for COVID coughs in her face, she has a 95% chance of not catching the virus?"
29246,She has been spotted numerous times trying to purchase licensed Microsoft software since the jab work.
29247,I don't know that it matters any more.
29248,Back in March accurate data from China would have been great to have.
29249,We have more than enough data on our own now.
29250,But you're also removing more targets/vectors even quicker the faster it does spread.
29251,"Not saying this is a good thing, but at some point natural infection immunity and the vaccine compliment each other."
29252,Like 2 cars going head on.
29253,You close the gap faster....
29254,This is why I oppose lockdowns.
29255,"Not because the perfect one wouldn’t be perfect, but because I know how the real world works."
29256,In my town the liquor store stayed open and the food bank had to close.
29257,"In South Africa, they are banning liquor sales to keep the hospitals empty."
29258,"None of this is intentionally bad, but I believe individuals, as imperfect as they are, are generally better poised to make their own health priorities."
29259,Even when it comes to communicable diseases.
29260,"It won’t be perfect mind you, but then look at what happened to London trains when they announced the new lockdowns."
29261,Counterproductive.
29262,So many things happen that you don’t see coming when you do too down.
29263,Right?
29264,Was about to comment this.
29265,Time is flying now
29266,"I'm a high school teacher in California, CTA has made it very clear that we will not be resuming in person classes this year, so why are teachers included in 1B?"
29267,"I want the vaccine asap, but if were not going back then there is no reason for us to be in that group."
29268,Finna...
29269,We went from discovery of there being a virus to clinical trials for its vaccine in less then 8 months.
29270,Doesn’t she have any other clothes?
29271,There is no actual difference.
29272,It’s just exciting for people to hear that the vaccine is approved and normal people are getting vaccinated.
29273,"I understand where you are coming from, but this is one of those things you need to let go."
29274,Let people find comfort in what ever they can right now.
29275,"That makes complete sense to me, when people are hopeless they lose the will or need to survive."
29276,"Your gramps would have fought through beach landings and hedgerows, seeing probably dozens of his mates die."
29277,Finally he realizes Berlin is within touching distance and hope comes back.
29278,And with that comes the fear.
29279,If our generation and boomers were collectively half as tough as your grandad we'd have been through this by September.
29280,"Honestly, I weirdly feel more gutted for anyone who loses a loved one to Covid in the next six months than I do for the last 12."
29281,"Because now they have a fighting chance, and its just a matter of time."
29282,Hopefully we’re closer to them rolling out the version of the vaccine that doesn’t affect people with severe allergies so much.
29283,This whole things been terrifying.

29305,Maybe you could get the ingredient lists of the past flu vaccines your relative got.
29306,"It should be public, and on the internet."
29307,Then you may suspect some ingredients.
29308,Having one or two that didn't cause allergy would be a huge help too.

29327,Saving this comment.
29328,I will be using this genius analogy.
29329,If you’re asymptomatic you’re still infected.
29330,The vaccine at the very least STOPS that infection from manifesting in the body and damaging it.
29331,The vaccinated won’t get organ damage as the disease won’t do anything to them.
29332,WHO has NoOo IdEa how it’s still spreading though.

29353,"Again, the paper itself admits that this is an extrapolation itself by claiming that they're potential."
29354,We know that simply testing twice alone is not indicative of reinfection.
29355,This paper is clearly angling for more research into the topic.
29356,"For example, here's a recent paper that used testing to show that risk of reinfection after 6 months is substantially reduced."
29357,"&gt;A total of 223 anti-spike–seronegative health care workers had a  positive PCR test (1.09 per 10,000 days at risk), 100 during screening  while they were asymptomatic and 123 while symptomatic, whereas 2  anti-spike–seropositive health care workers had a positive PCR test  (0.13 per 10,000 days at risk), and both workers were asymptomatic when  tested (adjusted incidence rate ratio, 0.11; 95% confidence interval,  0.03 to 0.44; P=0.002)."
29358,**There were no symptomatic infections in workers  with anti-spike antibodies.

29393,"Sorry, it’s not just a job, it’s livelihood, home, dignity to provide for your family and in many cases, mental health."
29394,It’s not a done deal that any geriatric catching Covid will die either.
29395,As you have demonstrated
29396,On a scale of 1-10 how bad is this...
29397,I was vaccinated yesterday.
29398,Today I noticed black helicopters flying around my house.
29399,"Also, I had a very erotic dream about Bill Gates last night."
29400,"Right now at least, the folks in long-term care are used to having others take care of this for them."
29401,"So, we should be operating fairly efficiently for group 1A."
29402,They all are expecting a top-down approach to distribution.
29403,"We'll see what happens when 1B starts opening up and it switches to bottom-up, where we'll have to do more outreach than instruction."
29404,"Nothing you have said refutes  the  points I made
, Ill repeat

1.New never used for vacinnes or any other medication!"
29405,2.Normally 10 years of testing bedore released to public which allows time to see any long temr effects.
29406,you cannot counter either of these 2 arguments because they are true.
29407,Name ONE medication or vaccine that has used this technology and released to the public.
29408,you wont be able to.
29409,goodluck
29410,I didn't know people could get allergy testing for vaccine inactive ingredients like PEG.
29411,"I have a relative who's had allergic reactions to multiple vaccines but the Dr didn't refer for testing, just stopped giving yearly flu etc."
29412,It would be so good to find out what is the problem so they can get one of the coronavirus vaccines as soon as their tier is ready to go.
29413,I would guess there are more people who are needle phobic than are total fruitcakes.
29414,I could be wrong.
29415,"I don’t think you can win over the antivax nuts, but you totally can win over needle phobic people."
29416,I’m one of those.
29417,Maybe but the original post said that florida isn't doing bad.
29418,The death rate shows that is false.
29419,She looks pretty good for a dead person.
29420,So are we expecting relatively accurate data today till Thursday?
29421,I know with the holidays there's been a lot of underreporting the past week and just wondering if we need to wait until after New Years to see things back on track in terms of reporting?
29422,I know.
29423,It’s wishful thinking.
29424,Humans truly missed an opportunity to come together with this one.
29425,True.
29426,But I was trying to stay optimistic without losing the realistic.
29427,Article says man had no travel history.
29428,"So yeah, we’re screwed."
29429,Is this not the placebo group getting the real one?
29430,Thank you for that information.
29431,😊
29432,Do you get the microchip with the first or the second injection?
29433,/s
29434,I  have never met an adult who is so averse to a needle that they will forego an important vaccination or medicine who didn't have a serious mental deficiency.
29435,i used headcase as a joke but ok.
29436,Royal we.
29437,I mean humanity at large.
29438,He gave them that ability by....lying.
29439,[deleted]
29440,"Yes but, is that really the first group that comes to mind or that should be focused on when it comes to vaccine hesitancy?"
29441,I'd say the microchippers are the bigger concern.
29442,"Ok, even in that example it was 450 people out of millions vaccinated - and the flu itself could have caused more people to get that condition than the vaccine did."
29443,The 1976 vaccine debacle was just about a panicked government that would have looked smart if the 1918 flu was really back.
29444,"You're forgetting that with a variant with potentially much higher R0/contagiousness, the threshold for herd immunity will be a greater % than with less contagious versions."
29445,You need heavier mitigation efforts/immunity to lower transmission
29446,I completely disagree with you and we probably won’t make much headway with eachother.
29447,Just as you think someone like me is fixated on believing that China is not currently covering up huge outbreaks it seems like you are pretty dug in with the idea that they are.
29448,Sure people walk around like normal here but then you start to see the impact and hear about a crap ton of people who have it or have had Covid.
29449,And when spread happens on that scale there are things you can see.
29450,In my community (my suburban/rural county is 350k people) we are logging 300 positive cases a day.
29451,I ’ve known 14 separate families who have gotten Covid in the past 2-3 weeks.
29452,If you drive by our hospital 1/3 of the windows have newly installed vents in them because of all of the Covid patients they are serving.
29453,Schools have been shut down for in person learning for the past month because they have all blown right by their case level protocols.
29454,Everywhere I turn I find out someone either has had or has just gotten Covid.
29455,"My tenant had Covid 2 weeks ago, my wife’s work has had multiple cases in the past few weeks."
29456,Literally half my staff an my work has had it in the past 5 months.
29457,Yet in Shanghai a metropolitan area that dwarfs most us cities that doesn’t seem to be the case I mentioned that my friend from grad school teaches English in a large school in the burbs of Shanghai.
29458,2 months ago they had one student who had a relative test positive and they shut down the school for 3 weeks and tested everyone who possibly had any contact with that student (even though he never tested positive).
29459,My friend hasn’t personally known anyone who has had Covid in the past 5 months.
29460,Nor is he seeing his students conspicuously absent in any way different from a typical year.
29461,Why is it easier for you to believe at this point that they are being really sneaky as opposed to being over the top proactive?
29462,And honestly this isn’t about China being great it’s more about what this pandemic looks like if you let it get out of control vs stamping it down when you still have the window to do so.
29463,Plus we’ll have more vaccines hopefully coming online.
29464,And a competent administration.
29465,"I think since it’s very early on, there are kinks to iron out but I’m hopeful."
29466,I know 10 people personally who have been vaccinated already and my grandmother is getting hers next week :)
29467,I trust that number as much as I trusted the initial covid numbers.
29468,"Remember when 1.2 million Americans would be dead of covid by June, if all steps to stop it were taken?"
29469,Fantastic!
29470,Good luck with the study!
29471,/u/ka4bi isn't wrong.
29472,I'm South African and the public health system is a mess.
29473,"Some of the stories that came out of Dora Ngiza were horrific: mothers being left with dead babies, bloody sheets not changed for weeks."
29474,"I once went for stitches and had to wait 10 hours only to be told to come back the next day, waited another 4 hours."
29475,The drop in cases is due to closing every state supported testing site for 2 days.
29476,Testing employees deserve to spend time with their loved ones also.
29477,There's a surge of testing on December 26th.
29478,There is a lag from test sample collection to processing to results of 2-5 days for PCR test  and 1 day for rapid tests.
29479,We should see a case spike for Dec 29th-Dec 31st vs Dec 22nd-24th.

29506,Yea... and like mono it's likely to afflict only a small percentage of those who get it and lessen in severity over time.
29507,"A quick google shows estimates that 90-99% of people in the US will acquire mono at some point in their lives, and long term chronic illnesses from mono are extremely rare."
29508,Herd immunity doesn't mean we are all immune.
29509,It means the big blob of humans in any given areas has enough resistance that the virus is not a big deal and outbreaks are small and manageable like a normal virus would be.
29510,"You can still spread the virus, but if enough people are vaccinated it still won't matter that much because most people will have a prepped immune system that will beat it easily."
29511,So that only leaves the unvaccinated people to cause outbreaks and the ratio to unvaccinated to vaccinated people in a given area will matter.
29512,"Lower population density areas will survive higher rates of non-vaccinated people without MAJOR outbreaks, but those small groups might suffer quite a bit and realistically more rural areas will get vaccinated as they learn the hard way until outbreaks are minimal enough that nobody pays much attention."
29513,"We have herd immunity from many flu strains, but we are not all immune to each strain and people still get the old strains even though there is SOME herd immunity BUT they don't turn into big outbreaks... that's all herd immunity means."
29514,There is no highly scientific definition of herd immunity and really the immune response and virus traits will determine at what level herd immunity would produce the desired effect of controlling the virus.
29515,It's not just magically the same for all viruses just like our immune response is not magically the same for all viruses.
29516,"Some viruses have cross strain immunity potential and some don't, for instance."
29517,So with a virus like the Flu you might get away with lower vaccination percents to get herd immunity because there are so many strains and life long antibodies created over the years in the populations of the world.

With New Case positivity rate check the County Report because that the true testing number for Negatives which can be found in the County report as stated "" These counts include the number of people for whom the department received PCR or antigen laboratory results by day."
29560,"This percent is the number of people who test positive for the first time divided by all the people tested that day, excluding people who have previously tested positive."""
29561,"So add 11,887+40,372=52,259 11,887/52,259=22.75% Calculation version its similar to just different positive numbers 12,075+40,372=52,447 12,075/52,447=23.02%."
29562,The vaccine doesn’t just protect you - the idea is that it could allow us to get to herd immunity while avoiding losing all those people who are at risk.
29563,It’s fair to give the percentage who die since that’s the case.
29564,Everybody is giving really complicated answers but it's actually pretty simple and less scary than it sounds.
29565,The government wants everybody to take it and a way to help that happen is to transfer liability to themselves.

The reason you can go to Walmart but not have people at your house is

a) you have to be able to buy food

b) the danger from exposure is length of exposure - more than 10-15 minutes within 2m of the same person."
29689,You don't generally do this at supermarkets - you may briefly pass people but contact isn't sustained.
29690,"Also, you wear face covering and people don't indoors with friends/family because they think they're safe."

30220,I had already started extra handwashing and avoiding hand shaking/physical contact somewhat.
30221,I've been thinking for months that the one good thing to come out of this pandemic is a normalization of wearing masks so that I could add that going forward.
30222,"Given the warnings that SARS-Cov-2 likely won't be the last serious viral disease, I'm with you in that masks will probably be a regular part of my life going forward when there are known viral infections in the area."

30227,The Spanish Flu caused life expectancy in the US to drop over 10 years between 1917 and 1918.
30228,And the Spanish Flu was practically a minor inconvenience in comparison to what smallpox was for Native Americans or the Black Plague was to Europeans.
30229,"I think we aren't prepared for a ""real"" plague, not because our governments are ill-prepared, but because the average person literally can't comprehend how deadly historical plagues are, and we've been conditioned to think wearing a mask and ordering takeout is the only necessary line of defense between humanity and a plague."

30237,"This comment was just hyperbole and kind of cringy, considering Fauci himself has already said by fall we'll likely be mostly back to normal (assuming no major hiccups with vaccinations)"
30238,AFAIK CureVac doesn't have much production capabilities themselves yet.
30239,They have to outsource until their own factory is built in 2022.
30240,Much like Moderna.
30241,The problem with BioNTech is probably also whether other producers even have the necessary freezer capacity to make that vaccine at a large scale.
30242,The increased difficulty suing is what I was referring too with the VA and Community Health.

30301,The vaccines (Moderna &amp; Pfizer) have been shown to be ~95% effective.
30302,"But among the ~5% that still caught covid in the vaccine trials, there were 0 serious cases of covid (i.e."
30303,hospitalizations).
30304,"Which suggests that even if it doesn’t protect you completely from infection, it gives you enough resistance to prevent severe symptoms from developing."

30317,"Honestly, if our goal is to get deaths and hospital capacity under control as quickly as possible there are three groups that should be vaccinated before anyone else: hospital workers, nursing home workers, and nursing home residents."
30318,Once all three of those groups are vaccinated think we'll see a huge difference in CFR and treatment.

30320,So when the vaccine becomes widely available so that someone like myself is eligible to get it at Walgreens or something..
30321,Does this mean I'll have to get multiple injections?
30322,And you don't find it odd China is able to do this when the rest of the world is in chaos?
30323,Something doesn't add up here.

30344,That’s factual.
30345,Yeah the news yesterday said 14k.
30346,But that has not yet been into national numbers.

30415,I have a number of American friends in China who seem to relay the sentiment (via vpn) that at this point it’s like Covid was never there.
30416,And when it does pop up the government swoops in to get a handle on it and the people impacted take the mitigation’s seriously and in 3-4 weeks everything is back to normal.
30417,My friend who talks about it in most detail lives in the outskirts of Shanghai.
30418,"To be clear, 500,000 infections; about 10% to 20% of infections of SARS-CoV-2 develop into cases of COVID-19"
30419,But for you to start shedding the virus enough to spread it to someone else your body needs to produce it in large enough amounts to create an infectious viral load in your breath/droplets/etc.
30420,So it’s also possible that the immune response from the vaccine is strong enough that it shuts down any infection before your body reproduces the virus enough to possibly spread it to someone else.
30421,We don’t really know yet which is more likely.
30422,"I have that plugin and it doesn't work for SA, unfortunately."
30423,You don’t absorb 100% is the reason the same reason you take more than you need of most pill vs IV.
30424,So if the max is 4000 taking 5000 isn’t OMG overdose amount.
30425,Regardless the point is you don’t give an entire population a drug that only half need and could negatively affect the other half.
30426,Is that why all those red hats act the way they do?
30427,"Great in theory, ignored by everyone."
30428,"If the rushed development/distribution process warrants no concerns to you, do you think we should rush vaccine studies and approval in a similar way in all cases going forward, then?"

30434,Studies suggest that is was responisble for the Russian Flu in 1889/1890.

30508,"For anyone in Ontario, here’s some good news: they just announced that 60% of the population will be vaccinated by June (8 / 14.5 million)."
30509,Because I have yet to see any valid evidence or reasoning otherwise.
30510,Because I know people with a much higher level of knowledge and expertise in the subject than myself who trust it and I trust their judgement.
30511,Bullheaded would be continuing to trust it after seeing valid evidence to the contrary.
30512,Just because my mind  jumped to one ( what I considered more likely) conclusion doesn't mean I wouldn't have changed it if/ when faced with more contradictory info.
30513,"Do you mean for the sole purpose of spreading it, or already had some train trip planned?"

30519,"It says ""21% of used beds have COVID-19 patients"" isn't that over the 15% 'shutdown' rate?"
30520,Would it need to stay this high for 6 more days to lockdown or am I confusing two different things?
30521,The people who work in media are much smarter than the population.
30522,"Plus, 36 states just started vaccinating their LTCF residents yesterday, only 12 states started last week, so the numbers should improve greatly."
30523,"Fuck, that sounds awful."
30524,I think it might be a bladder infection.
30525,the doctor gave me an Rx and said if I don’t feel better by day 3 to go to the hospital.
30526,"I was just surprised to hear he thought it was covid, I know that fatigue and intestinal trouble are symptoms, but I feel the same level of shitty I did 5 years ago with my last bladder infection."

30529,"That one study was of 25 people and only people who had severe cases of SARS...and even then, T-cell memory doesn't prevent reinfection on it's own."

30537,It doesn't really mean anything.
30538,Vaccines provide optimal protection two weeks after the second shot.
30539,So if many (there will always be rare events) people get infected more than 2 weeks after the second shot then we will have something to worry about more.
30540,In this case for all we know they were infected before being vaccinated.

30545,And  left windows down in the garage overnight.
30546,I think it should be ok.
30547,Thanks again for the info
30548,Here in Australia we have such a small number of covid cases that they do virus gene testing routinely to confirm where the virus was caught.
30549,So if a person visited a restaurant and caught covid they confirm that they actually caught it at the restaurant and not somewhere else by comparing the virus genes.
30550,"Yep, I'm not going to vote for him in 2022."

30588,Nope.
30589,These aren't PTSD symptoms.

30635,"A lot of different decision makers are going to need to make some tough decisions, but hopefully as these things all come back online, we'll see better rapid testing available and requirements could be proof of ""vaccine or medical exemption with rapid test""."

30685,People with coronavirus are still getting up in the morning.
30686,No one knows how many.
30687,I’d also argue people are actually listening/forced to follow the restrictions.
30688,It’s not like they can really “safely” test for it anyways.
30689,"They’d have to vaccinate several people, send them to a COVID ward without any protection, then put them in a room with a bunch of non-vaccinated people with no protection."
30690,They can test it out over time but doing it in a controlled environment potentially could infect and possibly kill those involved.
30691,I think NYC will lockdown again soon probably.
30692,I was exposed again this week through my girlfriends work.
30693,So we’re all getting tested.
30694,Co-worker and family are really sick at the moment.
30695,I’m getting tested tomorrow and will stay in otherwise until I get the results.

30748,In my city some guy on the subway got punched in the face for refusing to put his mask on.
30749,"Then we looked back, he was wearing it after that."
30750,That’s cuz the vaccine is a small dose of the live virus DUUH
30751,I actually bought some in April when I read it might be effective.
30752,Another CCP drone.
30753,You people spread lies even faster than you infect the world with Covid.
30754,Most people here aren’t arguing that masks aren’t good.
30755,They’re saying criminalization of not wearing a mask would have horrid consequences.

30768,Then Bloomberg et al have done their job.
30769,Right?
30770,I thought that's what I read.
30771,"You can still get and spread it, which is why even after you get the vaccine they're still making you wear masks."
30772,"Even though this is not a clinical trial, there have been demonstrated benefits to melatonin for immune health before covid."
30773,"&gt;The phase 2 results showed it immune response 5-10x more than the others

This sounds like it might be interesting, but I have no idea what exactly you're trying to say."
30774,"I mean, you can 100% prevent it."
30775,"It just takes religiously wearing the N95, wearing eye protection, washing your hands before donning/doffing your PPE, and washing your clothes/showering as soon as you get home."
30776,I know people who worked for months straight in COVID ICUs around known positive patients who never got COVID.
30777,I definitely haven't.
30778,Well lots of stuff out there on Ayn rand and her serial killer love interest
30779,"It’s not surprising, it’s a headline grabber for those who don’t know."
30780,I believe peer reviewed studies from the WHO and data from the CDC.
30781,What do you believe?
30782,Reasonable.
30783,Anti-maskers should actually be thrown in prison.
30784,"If you don't have any luck with melatonin, I started taking magnesium and noticed an improvement in my sleep as well"
30785,"I’m sure it’s doable, but not by a moderator."
30786,That would be Reddit admin territory.
30787,We had one shipment temperature issue in the south.

30790,I am sure a study of that magnitude will be published in a few years
30791,But isn’t the first two vaccines supposed to help with the symptoms of COVID?
30792,It’s not preventative.
30793,"Yes, the virus is that bad."
30794,"If you're still tested positive after 10 days, then you shouldn't go back to work."
30795,You could spread it to others.
30796,"He's got family and constituents he's going to infect, who are going to infect others."
30797,"It's never an ""oh well"" situation."
30798,Even the people we dislike catching it has consequences.
30799,Its working just as intended
30800,"It is very unlikely that those who have been vaccinated or infected can spread the virus, but we won't know for sure for a while."
30801,Good.
30802,Good for you.
30803,Thanks for the link!
30804,I was wondering if you had to continue wearing a mask once you were vaccinated.
30805,"I was thinking you would still need to, not to protect yourself, but purely so there is no ""I got the vaccine already so I don't have to wear a mask"" lying going on."
30806,Anyone know if this could affect hernia mesh implants too?
30807,I’m still planning on getting the vaccine ASAP but I’m curious if I should maybe take it easy working out for a bit afterwards and go easy on my abdomen to prevent the mesh screwing up.
30808,"Trumps thought process: my family and I already caught it, and fuck everyone else, so come to my party"

30816,I don’t think you need to feel asshole-y at all.
30817,"They had their chance, you wait your turn, fuck ‘em."
30818,"Well the good thing is if they get Covid, they'll just trust in God to heal them, and not call an ambulance or go to the hospital, which is already full."
30819,"And if the Good Lord decides it's time, well stay home and die there, and don't take up the resources needed by normal people."
30820,"&gt;(Reuters) - Britain must vaccinate two million people a week to avoid a third wave of the coronavirus outbreak, a study by the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine (LSHTM) has concluded."
30821,"That prompted tight social mixing restrictions measures for London and southeast England, while plans to ease curbs over Christmas across the nation were dramatically scaled back or scrapped altogether."
30822,&gt; She didn't see the point in getting standing in a queue for a test with others that might have it.
30823,where is your friend located?
30824,the district i am following they send the specialized med team to your apartment for the first and every following test.
30825,There's something very wrong with this data.
30826,Places with good medical care and fast testing have 20-40 days delay from (reported) cases to deaths.
30827,"France, for instance, has had a flat ~1.5% CFR with about a 30-day delay."
30828,Even poorly run states like Wisconsin have an observable large delay of ~24 days.
30829,"In Colorado, we can measure every step of the delay: the average time from symptom onset to reported cases is about 7 days, and the average time from onset to reported death is about 30 days."
30830,"Korea's latest outbreak jumped on November 15, and their deaths jumped on December 5 (using 7-day rolling averages [from worldmeters](https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/country/south-korea/))."
30831,"But cases seemingly peaked on December 19 (rolling average 976), while deaths momentarily flattened on December 23."
30832,"Either CFR has risen dramatically over the last month, or the delay from testing to death has dropped equally dramatically."
30833,"I'd love to read this, but it costs a dollar."
30834,Sometimes I feel me and my family are incredibly stupid to stay home during the holidays.
30835,"We are young and in the low risk group, still have avoided all travel except the grocery store visits."
30836,All year since March.

30842,"-It can't be eradicated, at least not very easily, due to having animal reservoirs, meaning it will always potentially have a new host to infect

30843,Worldwide as well.
30844,Do you see that many people getting vaccinated?

30900,I’ve never heard that before and as a nurse I find it really interesting!
30901,A lot of people where I live (RI) are upset about inmates and staff at the ACI getting the vaccine one day before the first nursing homes.
30902,"The way I see it is that they’re both vulnerable populations, and from what I understand the reason the ACI was able to distribute it a day earlier was bc it was up to the state."
30903,The nursing homes have an agreement with the feds and pharmacies and had to wait until they had enough doses for the green light before they could start vaccinating staff/residents.
30904,I spent almost a decade working in nursing homes and I’m now at a (shitty) hospital.
30905,"It’s awful at a lot of nursing homes right now, I can only imagine what it’s like at some of the really crummy ones, bc it sure as shit sucks at the hospital."
30906,"I imagine the ACI is more crowded and I’d guess the conditions aren’t too great, so I can’t understand why people are making a huge deal about one day!"
30907,"We’re all humans and a lot of people in prison are there bc they got an unfair deal or made a stupid decision bc they were young or desperate, so I see no reason why it’s pissing people off that they’re getting treated like humans."
30908,"Yeah, there’s some scumbags who can rot in prison forever and I don’t really feel too sorry for them, but there’s a lot of people who don’t deserve to be denied/delayed access to the vaccine just bc they’re incarcerated."
30909,Maybe the people who are mad should think about the staff if they can’t get past the whole inmate thing.
30910,"It’s pretty simple, vaccinating high risk populations helps to protect everyone!"
30911,The goal is harm reduction.
30912,"What’s going to happen is that no matter what, a lot of people are going to gather in private homes without any ventilation."
30913,And that’s a lot worse than people being closer together outside in masks since apparently that same set up didn’t spread covid at all during BLM protests.
30914,"to answer your question, no they didn't skip any trials."
30915,"they approved it for use in humans to start phase 3 trial, at which point districts got X amount of doses to give to volunteers."
30916,"when that phase was finished they approved it for general public, but still limited to specific people due to limited availability."
30917,"(all voluntary)

recently they finished testing on people over 60, found it to be just as effective."

31092,Hence why if you have ever had a flu shot some people get a mild case of the flu.
31093,The OP's comment about side effet stands because GENERALLY if some one were to have a side effect it wouldn't be a symptom of the virus at hand and would be some other reaction to the vaccine.

31153,Full immunity is considered at 2 weeks after the second shot.

31191,The government has no problem regulating those acts.
31192,"Apparently, if I have BBQ on my private prop it is a threat to the community."
31193,"Given your attitude, you wouldn't openly acknowledge or disclose the risks to participants in your barbecue if someone was potentially exposed, so yes, you are a threat to the community."
31194,"And as for everything else you said/quoted, while you highlighted the selfish points of less protection to the wearer of said masks, you also highlighted the fact that they do help protect other people."
31195,"So again, yes this selfish mindset is a threat to the community, and people like you should be rounded up and placed in a confined spa e together, devoid of medical care, and left to your own barbecues and birthday parties and shindigs to your hearts content."

31202,"Regardless of political party, politicians are scum."
31203,That video also just shows people walking on non-crowded streets.
31204,"It's not really there that people get infected, and masks in that situation wouldn't do much difference."
31205,Stockholm is also often an outlier in Sweden.
31206,"It is by far the largest city, and is quite different from much of the rest."
31207,Asymptomatic transmission is not as high as symptomatic transmission but it still happens.
31208,Since the vaccines only stop most of the receivers from getting a symptomatic infection of the virus the spread potential will be lower.
31209,The key is that once most people have had the vaccine the fact that some people still have asymptomatic infections should mostly stop the transmission.
31210,That is the goal of the vaccination plans.
31211,Yeah that happened in the trials too.
31212,10ish days after first there seems to be some immunity but the point of the second dose is to amplify immune response.
31213,"Any meta analysis of mask wearing that has been done shows marginal benefits, if any."

31237,"San Bernardino County, CA does this."
31238,It's called APOD.

31243,So they can still spread it (unknown) but having sars-cov2 is not the same as having covid 19.
31244,It did not cause covid 19 in 95%

31247,"We can’t make a direct comparison, who knows how many people could have died of covid in 1918."
31248,And if the Spanish Flu had emerged in the 21st century it likely would have killed far fewer people.
31249,We can all agree it is still a terrible loss of life.
31250,"""331 million"" and falling......"
31251,So many people don't have sick time and half of those who do it's very frowned upon to use it
31252,Ventilation on a plane is much greater than any other public space.
31253,The airplane ride is probably the least problematic part of the travel.
31254,I punched 3^10 (~3 is the estimated R0) and 5.1^10 (70% increased infectiousness from the UK variant) and let out a homer simpson scream when I saw the resultant numbers

31256,I wonder how people who refuse the vaccine would react if we started calling it the Trump vaccine around them.
31257,"‘Wait, you’re refusing the trump vaccine?"
31258,How could you do that?’ Could even act like it’s a different vaccine if it’s helpful.
31259,\^ I've been wondering if this is going to happen at some point (vaccine tourism).
31260,I live on a state border and I could see people going to one side or the other depending on which state between the two moves to Phase 2 and Phase 3 fastest.
31261,"Phase 1 seems fairly regimented, but once CVS gets doses for everybody are they going to stop you at a Kansas CVS if your drivers license is from Missouri?"
31262,Will be interesting.
31263,You're giving him way too much credit.
31264,How do you think he and his family caught it in the first place?
31265,Why didn’t you care about me infecting someone with the flu last year?
31266,It could be potentially deadly...
31267,I think that's the problem.
31268,It's really up to an individuals will power to withstand inconvenience.
31269,"It was honestly harder to follow pregnancy guidelines a year ago personally, than it has been this entire year."
31270,"And I work with the elderly so I have a little more incentive to stay cautious, but a lot of people don't even have that."
31271,People will find those excuses until the bad happens to them.
31272,"And then even when it happens to them, and a family member dies, they stay cautious until that willpower dies down again (which I've seen in person from two different people)."
31273,"Basically, unless the inconveniences to them not being cautious outweigh their personal inconveniences to be cautious, there will always be people that refuse to follow safety."
31274,That's just one of the downfalls to living in an individualistic culture.
31275,But thank you for putting your family's wellbeing to heart by keeping that mask on.
31276,"You'll never know if that saved anyone, but you'll also never know if slacking off would have killed anyone."
31277,&gt; This finding suggests that risk for infection was higher for those wearing cloth masks.

As compared to medical masks - lol"
31279,You should see some of the comments and downvotes and name calling and shame and oddly enough “gold” and other awards.
31280,"This is definitely a polarizing, dynamic pandemic."
31281,Here in the states that is.
31282,Other countries seem to have beat it.
31283,"Each vial contain 5 doses, the administrating staff was supposed to dilute it before giving it."
31284,"Very easy mistake to make if you are used to giving the vial as-is (almost all medications in vials are), but this seems like very bad training (or maybe the staff was very nervous and forgot)."
31285,Why didnt you wear a mask before March 2020?

31292,"I was stuck away from my wife for 8 months, I think that's a good reason to travel."
31293,It can.
31294,Refuse vaccine?
31295,No care.
31296,"Cool, thanks!"
31297,"The person who I was replying to implied that even though the vaccine was developed quickly, “no corners were cut” in the approval process."
31298,I thought we were still missing long-term studies that would reveal any long term complications or side effects.
31299,"I guess my question is - we know the virus can cause heart and nervous system complications after the initial illness, so how do we know this vaccine won’t also have some sort of long-term negative effect?"
31300,"Like, how do we know vaccine recipients aren’t at a greater risk of heart failure or something 20 years down the line?"
31301,I don’t think you understand how retarded you sound.
31302,"I think you know the reason they “discovered” masks, because it’s the most effective way of slowing it down."
31303,"It’s not like Africa where they can put up nets to stop it, so the next best thing is stopping the spread person to person, and if you think people are willing to wear masks for a few tb cases you’re wrong because people hat masks and there’s not enough risk in not wearing on"
31304,My husband got a sore arm after the first dose of the Pfizer vaccine.
31305,But he also had a three hour nap while I watched out two toddlers.
31306,Not sure if that was totally the vaccine 🤨.
31307,Disgusting anti-maskers
31308,"  Yay and soon America will vaccinate its first patient,probably by the end of the year, meaning vaccination numbers were only 19,999,999 short based on White House projections."

31310,"Wait, you guys keep count on how many are vaccinated?"
31311,We just started on Saturday so I guess maybe we will also keep count
31312,An organised public health system and a population far more accustomed to dealing with public emergencies in an organised fashion.
31313,"There are only about 1.5 million people in nursing homes in the US, and about 15,000 facilities total."
31314,"Seems like it would be pretty quick to vaccinate all of them, especially since they don't go anywhere so little risk of missing their 2nd dose."
31315,Thank you!
31316,"And then the absurdly high IFR (because we only tested people on deaths door) was reported to the public without context, driving mass panic."
31317,2020 was just the dress rehearsal for much worse pandemics to come.

*"" Studies demonstrate that cloth mask materials can also reduce wearers’ exposure to infectious droplets through filtration, including filtration of fine droplets and particles less than 10 microns."
31338,"The relative filtration effectiveness of various masks has varied widely across studies, in large part due to variation in experimental design and particle sizes analyzed."
31339,"Multiple layers of cloth with higher thread counts have demonstrated superior performance compared to single layers of cloth with lower thread counts, in some cases filtering nearly 50% of fine particles less than 1 micron .14,17-29 Some materials (e.g., polypropylene) may enhance filtering effectiveness by generating triboelectric charge (a form of static electricity) that enhances capture of charged particles18,30 while others (e.g., silk) may help repel moist droplets31 and reduce fabric wetting and thus maintain breathability and comfort."

31346,Are there any bets on how many governments will be voted out of power because of Covid?
31347,I don't understand your question.
31348,Smallpox was mostly eradicated by ~1970's.
31349,But before that it had killed about 300 000 000 people.
31350,"The world population was much smaller,  much less interconnected."
31351,"There is also the arguement that technology wasn't what it is today, and that governments are more effective today vs. 100 years ago."
31352,"With Covid-19 being what it is - imagine the economic, life loss, societal disruption of a virus that kills 300 000 000 people."
31353,Now adjust that for our current population base vs 1930.
31354,Adjust for all the travel and trade we do now vs then.
31355,Now imagine that that's just one of many pandemics.
31356,That's why I say we lucked out with this pandemic...

31718,"A lot of scary headlines out there, folks, but remember to always backcheck the data, media outlets love to showcase stats that can make things appear abnormal, because ""if it bleeds, it leads""!"
31719,This has been a tactic used for centuries.
31720,"As of December 24, 2020, the national ICU Occupancy Rate - [according to New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/us/covid-hospitals-near-you.html) \- was at 78%."
31721,"This certainly sounds scary, but when you look at [historical data from the National Center for Biotechnology Information](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3840149/figure/F1/), you can see that national average ICU Occupancy rates always hover around 80% occupancy in December/January."
31722,"Now in case the mods want to ban me for ""misinformation"" (despite having data sources), I would like to acknowledge that COVID-19 is a deadly, serious illness (as many viruses can be)."

31727,So we have successfully vaccinated 1 person... go America.
31728,Got the Pfizer yesterday.
31729,"I'm doing my best to make it through work, but I'm aching pretty badly all over."
31730,"Felt nauseous this morning, but that's gone."
31731,"And yes, the second dose is much worse."
31732,LOL.
31733,So you really are.
31734,Fine.
31735,Sinophobia - anyone who doesn't like the CCP.
31736,You're not the only one but you're wrong.
31737,I want to get this vaccine tomorrow and would even pay $100 if it's not subsidized by the government.
31738,How dare the government stop me from doing this?
31739,"Pretty much fat ass gun loving rednecks...send them home with a 44 and one bullet, tell em to suck it up."
31740,"Wow, what a numpty."
31741,Great argument.
31742,"Well, we're working a lot more together than the EU is lol"
31743,I heard schools are still open?
31744,"They act like they have no idea what could possibly be causing it

Hopefully Christmas break helps"
31745,"Well I can only speak for myself but Im definitely not a ""foreign agent"" or a propagandist."
31746,I'm also really careful about covid and have followed all the guidelines.
31747,Being locked down is hard and wearing masks for an extended period of time is unappealing to the vast majority of people.
31748,"Someone always has it worse, but people are still allowed to express themselves about their current circumstances which is what's being done in these threads."
31749,Yea and no one was ever killed by aids either.
31750,Fuck your semantics.
31751,"2-3 months so maybe 2 is enough, you also don't have no immunity after first dose just less immunity."
31752,Pfizer and Moderna are much more expensive and only so many can be produced in time.
31753,It's much better to have this as an option as well
31754,I can’t help the anti mask movement..it was political and that was a mistake.
31755,"However, to say that only the conservatives are responsible for the spread of covid isn’t true."
31756,Most Americans are simply fed up with waiting and staying at home and that has nothing to do with politics.
31757,I also do not support a governor telling a small business owner to shut down while he then turns around to high five Hollywood elites for the next big blockbuster hit..
31758,Amazon + China
31759,"20 versus 80, one is more accurate than the other also....

herd immunity is a dumb term anyway since it started on the first day someone got a case."
31760,yeah there's a big difference between 60% immune and 70% but you can't arbitrarily say that 69.9% is not herd immunity but 70.0% is.
31761,"(you aren't saying that but some do)

that last line is important since there have been many governors, presidents, health officials, prime ministers, etc etc who have done the same thing."
31762,[removed]
31763,"In my country we forgot our masks at home, sorry."
31764,Also we can’t breathe in them.
31765,"Florida is it’s own country, right?"
31766,It's a fucking huge difference.
31767,He wasn't fucking arrested.
31768,Are you really that stupid.
31769,"Think the recall for Governor Newsom is well over 750,000 signatures now"
31770,It doesn't need to be sterilizing to be effective.
31771,Simply reducing the incidence of serious illness will significant affect the course of this pandemic.
31772,"That doesn't mean we should relax our pubic health measures, certainly not until a large majority has been vaccinated."
31773,[removed]
31774,scapegoat how?
31775,Lol this is actually getting hilarious.
31776,"I guess you think it’s just a flu, huh?"
31777,Every day I drive by a field hospital and a mobile morgue at my local hospital which is otherwise running at well over 100% not including the extra buildings.
31778,I know two people in their 20s that died of covid this summer.
31779,I know of one person in their 30s that got covid 4 months ago and still can’t exercise and has tachycardia and doctors don’t know what to do.
31780,Compared with the highly documented vaccine side effects that are about the same level of risk as shellfish causing allergic reactions.
31781,So you’d rather get a mysterious deadly disease than eat shellfish.
31782,"See, I knew you were a COVID denier."
31783,Or just not very smart.
31784,Or just plain selfish.
31785,Just admit it.
31786,Someone with common sense thank you.
31787,"We will be vaccinating kids, trials are ongoing, they will test efficacy,  dosage, safety, and need for boosters."
31788,Uhhh no?
31789,Mitch didn’t do that for the first election
31790,Interesting.
31791,They claim to be keeping it to ensure they didn't miss people by accident.
31792,"Could also be used to ensure people who refuse the vaccine are charged for treatment if they get sick from the 'rona, rather than being treated on the spanish health service"
31793,"I mean, I still give a shit and honestly am following the restrictions and guidelines but its nice to commiserate with people about how much being locked down sucks and honestly wearing a mask sucks."
31794,"I know its a ""tiny piece of cloth over my face"" but I don't enjoy it lol."
31795,I care and Im trying to do the right thing but I don't see why we cant express ourselves too.
31796,She's spent time specifically supervising and running vaccine research studies?
31797,"Did she say why, given the way the vaccine works, she thought any long term effects might be worse or the same as the long term effects of actually getting covid19?"
31798,Did she say what study phases she was specifically worried had been rushed?
31799,Or was she just generally unhappy with the length of the study?
31800,"(Regardless, more for the rest of us, I suppose!)"
31801,If Germany says that the vaccine should be approved then EMA will oblige.
31802,The same thing happened with the Pfizer vaccine.
31803,What data exactly?
31804,"What is this ""effort"" even mean?"
31805,"You think states and hospitals are not trying to vaccinate people when fast vaccinations would reduce hospital burden, infections, and deaths."
31806,"Showing that they have a high vaccination rate would make the government more popular, allow them to open up earlier, make their state a more desirable place to be for residents and visitors."
31807,It's by far the most annoying EU privacy law.
31808,Just ban cookies.
31809,Agreed.
31810,Never said it was.
31811,But there are many here who would much rather discuss US flaws than China's...to the point where China doesn't have any.
31812,Ain't gonna happen.
31813,"So theres a lab called Serum Institute India, which is the largest vaccine producer in the world who have tied up with Oxford to produce their vaccine."
31814,It has around 50M doses already stockpiled.
31815,There are some Indian vaccines in the pipeline but approving one with some global recognition would be the way to go.
31816,Especially with the incredible collab between Oxford and Serum Insitute.
31817,Do run a quick google search on them.
31818,Quite fascinating.
31819,Idiots.
31820,It should've been approved a month ago.
31821,At least let people voluntarily get it for cash if you don't want to distribute if for free.
31822,Thank you!
31823,"Well you've said you work as a carer and yet you seem like you can't be arsed to care about a pandemic that affects people who require full time care, the immunocompromised, the elderly, the sick."
31824,"So yeah, I certainly can label you a petulant shithead and be quite confident in it."
31825,"Yes, but I am pointing out that the 20-49 age group is still several times higher than the flu."
31826,"And even if you ignore that, and the post viral symptoms from the disease you must consider this:

COVID overwhelms the medical system with the shear number of hospitalizations."
31827,A kid delayed in the emergency room because all the doctors are preoccupied with COVID is as good as dead.
31828,That is the biggest risk COVID poses to younger folk.
31829,"It hogs all the ICU rooms with elderly patients, leaving non for people who have all the conditions you speak of."
31830,Also cancer is a huge factor for COVID mortality btw.
31831,"It is clear to me you are anti lockdown, and are clearly motivates by a desire to get our economy back up and running."
31832,To that I say I am right with you.
31833,"I hate the lock downs too, but downplaying the very real risks is not how we are going to get back on track."
31834,Getting the whole population vaccinated is how we are going to get back on track.
31835,"The last sentence reminds me of ""this is fine"" meme."
31836,"he Great Mortality: An Intimate History of the Black Death, the Most Devastating Plague of All Time, by John Kelly."
31837,It intersperses history about what's going on in that approximate time period with how the Black Death spread and affected cities and regions.
31838,I borrowed it as an ebook from my library.
31839,Nobody is defending China but China isn't the reason that the US has bungled the response from the very beginning.
31840,Yes.
31841,"Meanwhile, hospitals have been firing health care workers in the US for whistle-blowing."
31842,The US is obsessed with accusing China of the things that the US is frequently guilty of.
31843,"If by “drinking the conspiracy koolaid” you mean “reading articles in the New York Times,” then yeah, spot on"
31844,Godpeed.
31845,May the covid you get be swift enough to not impact the rest of us.
31846,I cannot find information on how alcohol withdrawal should be treated if you are POSITIVE for covid.
31847,"Everything I have found only shows the affects of alcoholism and lockdowns, or how alcohol is bad if you have covid."
31848,I want to know if quitting cold turkey is dangerous if you are currently suffering from covid.
31849,"They only had to weld people's doors shut and build a hospital in two weeks, but it's ok, everything was fine......."
31850,Covid research is more advanced than people think.
31851,It actually started i believe back in 2010 or 2012 with the latest SARS virus.
31852,"Since then, research proposals and studies have been held on a back-burner waiting for the next pandemic with a SARS like virus."
31853,As soon as covid hit research started.
31854,"Research teams have worked flat-out since March, their work has been awesome!"
31855,"This research has been completed in the last 12 months, but it was started many years earlier."
31856,I agree with you.
31857,"I've had to cancel the same trip I've had planned each year since 2018, and I don't plan on international travel until 2022."
31858,Why rush it and go in 2021 when there will still be restrictions and neuter your own trip?
31859,"But people love travel, its the reason why airports are always so busy."
31860,Fauci has said we could be normal by summer so it’s pretty hard to push goalposts past that.
31861,Interesting!
31862,"Apologies for being nosy, but do you know if they're planning to follow up with you as part of any wider investigation of the effects of taking more than one kind of vaccine?"
31863,"I know a lot of people have been curious about that, but I understand that it might not be a priority under the circumstances."
31864,  Lol you don’t even have immunity after getting COVID-19 I should know.
31865,"Partial immunity is like have one wing on an airplane, you’ll fly directly to the crash site."
31866,I wishy the UK would have the balls to do this!
31867,It's probably less risky to work a natural immune response than to inject a synthetic yes.
31868,&gt; Can't the federal government send the navy hospitals there to help?
31869,"Part of the issue is staffing related, rather than necessarily space."
31870,If you don't have the nurses/doctors needed to treat patients more space isn't going to help.
31871,My heart skipped a beat when I read the first part of that sentence.
31872,Can you imagine the utter shit show amongst the anti vaxxers if anything had happened to her?
31873,As it happens it's a wonderful faint glint of light at the end of a very exhausting tunnel.
31874,Just made my appointment to get the Moderna vaccine in a week!
31875,That’s not the same as hundreds or thousands of kids dying of a disease.
31876,If people wanted gun control it opens a huge can of political worms and is a huge stretch for anyone on one side to vote for the gun control.
31877,It’s not the same at all.
31878,People who can afford it would pull their kids out of school and leave town.
31879,Dude tell me about it.
31880,Remember when Trump got COVID?
31881,That was only just under two months.
31882,&gt; If it was fatal in children as much as it is in older adults
31883,I live in Georgia...so replacing some with most would be fine 😂
31884,I got a lot of downvotes on this sub last week for suggesting the new variant is likely to outpace our vaccine efforts.
31885,"The math isn’t complex to compute, just hard to grasp exponential growth."
31886,"If the US government actually took care of its people like most of the world's nations did with this pandemic, then yes, i do to a large extent."
31887,"I would say keep outdoor parks open, but no outdoor concerts or events."
31888,Enforce social distancing by any nonlethal means necessary.
31889,"And for those who dont want to work out of safety concerns, let them not work, but also give them the means to live should they choose not to work."
31890,More authoritarian things have been done here for less severe catastrophes than a global pandemic.
31891,Oh the Nashville guy was just some random Q quack.
31892,"Well, I have tickets to a concert in May that year, so idk what'll end up."
31893,"Very solid reasoning that will appease the 400,000 Americans who died from Covid in 2020."
31894,Leadership matters in a pandemic.
31895,"The reason this was a ""record"" was due to combining two days results together."
31896,"Xmas day was combined with the 26th to produce this ""record"" ""day."""
31897,"In fact, if you look at averages:

&gt;Looked at more broadly, the average daily number of cases reported over a weeklong period has fallen slightly from its peak, which reached about 45,000 a day for the seven-day period ending Dec. 22."
31898,"By Monday night, the average daily number of new coronavirus cases was about 38,000."
31899,I disagree.
31900,They both have was of showing indifference to our suffering.
31901,But as in my example with Newsome.
31902,How is that caring?
31903,Exactly what I was thinking
31904,A lot of conspiracies hinge on the fact that layman terms and industry jargon look the same but mean very different things.
31905,The EU regulations that implemented the above requirements are incorporated into UK domestic law.
31906,"Unless the UK Parliament decides to repeal such laws (which I've not seen any indication they intend to), they'll still be in force."
31907,It’s great to see some countries doing such a great job with vaccines!
31908,You guys would have to do routine viral genome sequencing first.
31909,"You can’t deal with mutated covid variants if you don’t even know what the variants are, where it’s spreading or what differences the mutations make."
31910,I feel you.
31911,My new Dr dropped my klonopin in half and it feels like it couldn't possibly be a worse time to add withdrawals while yanking the one med that kept me sane.
31912,I do wear it.
31913,Stop trying to force it forever.
31914,The reason people are mad about the microchip is because Bill Gates STILL makes you buy the $70 controller.
31915,We all do things we regret.
31916,We all slip up.
31917,Best thing to do now is to make the next right choice.
31918,And go from there.

31923,I agree.
31924,The problem is that this becomes harder when placed like California manipulate the data so much that it makes 2020 to other year comparisons useless.
31925,"&gt;Whilst the number of cases reported today include some from over the festive period these figures are largely a reflection of a real increase,"" Dr Hopkins added."
31926,She is probably talking about the two nurses who had an allergic reaction to the vaccine but both were treated and are fine.
31927,Because of that they’re now monitoring people after they take the vaccine.
31928,In an article from may?
31929,And I just love how they addresses the Italian hotspot.
31930,Completely ignoring the tens of thousands of tourists that were flocking in from all over Europe for some skiing.
31931,One must wonder.
31932,"A country that has one of the worst track records in infection diseases like TBC, STI’s, hep B and C and other respiratory diseases, why they took the same ott measures as their nr 1 trading partner, neighbour and best friend China..... hmmmmm."
31933,"Also, check the numbers again."
31934,The actual current numbers.
31935,I’ll see myself out now.
31936,"Yes, you probably missed the part where Fauci has been intentionally  lying since March too."
31937,"5g has nothing to do with it, unless you're one of those people like that mentally unstable man from Nashville who blew himself up and destroyed parts of the cities."
31938,Ok it is possible that she hasn’t fully recovered yet.
31939,But that’s definitely not something I would be posting without that context.
31940,😂
31941,&gt;And CNN and MSNBC be given a slap on the wrist for being biased.
31942,"Aside from the constant whining from Republicans, what evidence is there of that?"
31943,"If anything, they seem to have a right-wing bias in their reporting."
31944,"If you're referring to their opinion shows, then I'd say we should just look at which ones are basing their opinions on actual facts rather than conspiracy theories based primarily on lies and disinformation."
31945,Glad you're better
31946,I did read that section.
31947,"You're misinterpreting it and/or analyzing it in a paranoid, very pessimistic way."
31948,"For example, there's no mention of 2025."
31949,"The one comment about two or three years, I've highlighted the relevant bit:

&gt;“For some, it has gone back to normal, and because of this, it will be two to three years before things are back to normal *for the cautious*, at least in the U.S.”

Essentially what they're saying is 'because people are fucking around acting as though there's no pandemic, it's going to take awhile for those who are worried to go back to a normal life'."
31950,As for the 'new kind of normal' comment - read the whole thing!
31951,"&gt;but I do think that new preventive measures that we’ve had to adopt, *like masks*, will feel normal in time."
31952,"In that sense, I’m optimistic that life will settle into a new kind of normal.”

Don't snip out the one portion of the sentence that you want to hyper-fixate on and be paranoid over."
31953,That's not doing you or anyone else any favours.
31954,Just.. You sound like you're looking for reasons to be paranoid and worried that things are going to 'last forever'.
31955,"None of those quotes said anything about restrictions or lockdowns or anything of the kind continuing, and they certainly didn't say anything about them getting tougher."
31956,"I mean I guess if you view masks as a 'restriction' then fine, but you should really say that instead of talking about 'restrictions', and you also need to take out any mention of things 'getting tougher'."
31957,Relax a little and stop being so paranoid because that *is* what you are doing.
31958,The one professor you quoted is in Moscow and is the only person saying 'maybe things will never go back' - unless you live in Russia why would you take that person's words as gospel?
31959,"Hell, even if you do live in Russia I'd be telling you - hey, that's only one person."
31960,"My children's pediatrician said that because of all the mask wearing, they're selling significantly decreased cases of other respiratory illnesses."
31961,My daughter definitely hasn't had nearly as many illnesses this year than prior years.
31962,Most of the kids in her class (preschool) wear masks all day (yet adults throw a tantrum for a quick grocery store run) and I'm sure the daily surface cleaning is much more thorough than prior years.
31963,My husband and I plan on wearing masks during cold and flu season going forward when we're out and about.
31964,"However different vaccines are entering the market, some of which don’t have the insane refrigeration requirement."

31967,Bunch of pessimistic vultures out there just looking for anything lmao
31968,"As I said, Indian vaccines are in process as well."
31969,"However, the collab between Serum Institute India and Oxford/AZ is a major contributing factor."
31970,"While Indian pharma and medicine is huge, the government's strategising and planning is incredibly poor - not something that bodes well for crisis situations like a pandemic."
31971,The government themselves are letting Serum Institute pretty much guide the whole vaccination drive.
31972,"I wouldn't be surprised if the vaccine will be used as a tool to secure vote banks across several states in the near future, thats the level of incompetence I'm talking about."
31973,'Elections are happening in X state soon?
31974,Let's start vaccinations there!'.
31975,I think you get the gist of it now.
31976,You could do some in depth research on Serum Insitute collab for more accurate details.
31977,Would be a better indicator on whats up here.
31978,Quit calling it a jab.
31979,Possibly.
31980,"There will still be dumdums, but tell me that tiny coffins on the news isn’t going to freak out a lot more moms and dads."
31981,"Just because there will always be some, doesn’t mean it won’t cut the number in half or more."
31982,"The economic devastation will be severe, especially since the people with all the spending  money will leave town."

31984,"It was that idiotic tweet from the surgeon general that convinced me to buy several cases of real masks the same day for myself and my extended family: https://twitter.com/Surgeon_General/status/1233725785283932160?s=20

It was a monumentally stupid and extraordinarily short-sighted strategy to preserve supply since 🍊 refused to use the DPA."
31985,"The CDC and other agencies going along with the lie wasnt surprising, but Fauci going along with it was truly sad."
31986,And its important to remember that he’s every bit as capable of playing politics as all the 🍊 sycophants are.
31987,&gt; 3 times more likely to get sick then you would with the BioNTech or Moderna vaccines.
31988,"Their efficacy for preventing hospitalizations was solid, which is what matters at the end of the day."
31989,Is it going to do a great job stopping you from catching it?
31990,"Probably not, but it does turn an otherwise potentially lethal disease into a shitty fever at worst."

Wow time really does fly in this hellacious purgatory."

32026,I mean if you're participating you can't be 100% sure you got the actual vaccine.
32027,Meanwhile in the Netherlands we are only going to start vaccinating in 3 weeks from now.

32031,And of course it depends on the person at the border.
32032,I had a guy at the entrance to Bolivia try and tell me I needed the vaccine entering from Chile and point to rules from 20 years prior that weren't in effect anymore.

32043,Lindsey Graham and little Marco getting vaccinated is a different story....

32049,Thats literally what 500x-1000x more children than are currently dying?
32050,Look raising public concern is a lot harder when 60% of deaths occur in people over 75.
32051,Most of the world revere children.
32052,Why cant people understand 2 simple facts?
32053,1.
32054,Authoritarian governments lie.
32055,2.
32056,Authoritarian governments lie.
32057,China just jailed a citizen journalist 4 years for reporting on COVID &amp; silenced many others.
32058,China denied investigations by the WHO in early January.
32059,China didnt warn the public for 6 days.

Russia supposedly took draconian measures, they shutdown travel from China by February, they claimed to be one of the leaders in testing, Russian parliament approved an ""anti-virus"" package of laws including up to 7 years in prison for serious violation of quarantine rules etc."
32061,Yet here we are.
32062,Egypt's health minister just revealed their infection rates are actually 10x higher than reported.
32063,"Russia just admitted their true number of cases, 

North Korea claimed no Coronavirus cases."
32064,Etc.

32071,This isn't exclusive to covid vaccines--they childhood vaccines series work the same way.
32072,"The idea being that vaccines are a very large public health good but, with a few exceptions, they are pretty minimally profitable."
32073,"So if you want companies to keep making them, one option is to have the government take over liability for the small number of people who are injured after vaccination."
32074,"No it must go exponential because you want to vaccinate billions of people

So it cannot be linear and it doesn't make sense to be linear

Exponential with a constant is still exponential... exponential with a limit is still exponential

And you better hope it is exponential because 2 million a week every single week will take five hundred weeks or ten years for a billion"

32090,Getting rockets launched at you all the time is a great way to increase national unity and make people work together.
32091,The same happened with the US after 9/11.
32092,Maybe countries need a good ol' defensive war every so often?
32093,"I wonder the the mRNA instructions degrade with time, and if we will need more injections over the years to teach them to build spike protein again and again."
32094,"Eventually, i think, someone will suggest a more permanent alteration of the cell genome if this continues to be a problem"
32095,Yeah I don’t think it’s actually going to be enforced.
32096,Just a ridiculous rule though
32097,Why are they adjusting capacity downwards for COVID-19 patients?
32098,Is it because COVID-19 patient require more staff to care for them than say a coma patient?
32099,That ICU capacity isn't just bed limited but staff limited.
32100,"That COVID-19 care is more intense, and they may be justified in applying this adjustment?"
32101,Average american and european can't even acknowledge the african union did a good job on covid except 2-4 countries in the entire african continent.
32102,Alot of half science about 'climate age demographic dense areas' nonsense ad naseum
32103,"It's in your own quote

&gt; to account for the intense demand for COVID-19 care."
32104,They are trying to reflect actual capacity for care as beds alone are not capacity.
32105,"Right after what you quoted :

&gt;Dr. Mark Ghaly, the state’s Health and Human Services secretary, addressed the adjustment  during Tuesday’s COVID update."
32106,"“When we have seen hospitals with ICU capacity used up for COVID above 30% we consider… that region’s ICU capacity really ill-prepared to serve and support individuals with other sorts of urgent and emergent needs, like heart attacks, strokes, other trauma.”"
32107,Doesn't that mean like 1/3 of USA considering diabetes and heart conditions and asthma fall into this category?
32108,Aw shit here we go again
32109,"Perhaps, but exactly just how much more transmissible it is remains to be seen."
32110,I was pretty upset seeing people dying in hospital corridors in the footage that came out of Wuhan.
32111,The idea that you have so many bodies that you need a fleet of those trucks is horrible.
32112,I keep hoping that people will wake up and stop being so stupid - it has been a very long year full of stupidity  .
32113,"That could be pathetic, but I found your contribution to this post even more pathetic."
32114,My fiancée works at one of the LA county hospitals (public hospitals) and I can assure you ITS NOT.
32115,I find it odd that this news is from nbc.
32116,Isn't nbc owned by microsoft?
32117,"Let me guess, the vaccines are useless against this variant as well?"
32118,Might as well just keep us in our homes for another year while we’re at it.
32119,So this barcode showing up on my ass isn't normal?
32120,/s because internet.
32121,"Eventually, yes."
32122,They're not (or very rarely) unblinded immediately.
32123,"I thin encouragin messages would be much more better but instead media tells people ""we will never be back in nornal"" ""ending pandemic will take years"" and that makes some people to think that obeying measures is useless anyway because it won't have any results."
32124,But in other hand bad news have more views so who cares about what is better.
32125,"By definition, you will need two tests to confirm reinfection."
32126,"And again, yes we agree that we need more research, as they detailed about in the article."
32127,"We should have done this from the start, it are quite frustrating."
32128,"The article you linked to, have assumptions."
32129,"One that you can extrapolate from the healthcare workers to the general population (continued level of re-exposure to the covid-19, general health, age etc.)."
32130,This article are from scientific studies.
32131,But ok here are one more.
32132,"And yes it are a peer-reviewed scientific article:
Sustained Positivity and Reinfection With SARS-CoV-2 in Children: Does Quarantine/Isolation Period Need Reconsideration in a Pediatric Population?"
32133,"https://www.cureus.com/articles/45640-sustained-positivity-and-reinfection-with-sars-cov-2-in-children-does-quarantineisolation-period-need-reconsideration-in-a-pediatric-population
Not fun reading to be honest."
32134,Meaning?
32135,Because the narrative that we don't know the long term side effects is false.
32136,"This mRNA process has been in development for years, ever since SARS (another coronavirus)."
32137,"We used the research from that, plus the endless funding, plus the endless volunteers."
32138,"The vaccine merely provokes your immune system to produce antibodies, the likelihood of that having long term side effects is zero."
32139,So we should keep restrictions forever for a small subset of the population?
32140,Just to get it straight.
32141,I hope get those who have these issues don’t expect the whole world to stop for them.
32142,"Where I live, gyms are open indoors illegally and not requiring masks."
32143,Fitness classes are being held just like pre COVID.
32144,Restaurants are open illegally as well.
32145,Yeah becaused they paid double the price for their vaccines and not so rich countries don't get enough vaccines.
32146,It's understandable but shouldn't be praised.
32147,"While we shouldn't exaggerate, too many people are advocating for the belief that all mutations are benign and will be covered by the vaccine."
32148,We really can't say that with confidence if we aren't even sequencing.
32149,no... we need his degree of stupid for the next generation.... to make the rest of us look like geniuses by comparison....
32150,(0.003% of adults) plus children = about 18% of the population in the UK.
32151,Doctors.
32152,Come on keep on track.
32153,If your gonna spout headlines then you need to be able to back it up with facts.
32154,What has happened to Zhang Zhan is fucking diabolical and indefensible.
32155,Unfortunately it's typical of the Chinese government.
32156,You are right to be mad at them for that.
32157,"And there in lies the problem with your statement about the doctors, you don't know what you are talking about."
32158,It's incredibly important to blame them for the things they do and not just some made up bullshit otherwise all arguments go out the window.
32159,"I'll happily criticize the ccp for the right things, but I'll correct the misinformation because i think it does more harm than good."
32160,"As for the recent frozen food handlers cases, i think it's plausible."
32161,I don't see any reason not to believe it.
32162,I wonder if that’s the guy who can’t say numbers.
32163,There's a stomach version?
32164,?
32165,"So all women nurses have to wear dresses, or they get a choice?"
32166,"As a woman who pretty exclusively shops in the  men’s department, I don’t think I’d ever work a job that required me to wear a dress."
32167,'Calling Jansen' - like NOW.....
32168,I definitely think the messaging early on in the pandemic was a big mistake from public health officials and now we're paying the price for it.
32169,"I think a huge chunk of people truly believed that after the ""two week lockdown"" this would be over"
32170,"Look into the ""Century of Humiliation""."
32171,"Some say the CCPs goal is not just to become the world's foremost superpower, but to also take revenge on the west."
32172,Spreading panic amongst your rivals during a crisis is a powerful tool.
32173,What's disappointing is that everyone I know who lives in Texas believes that the individual should be responsible and that the guberment needs to stay out of their business.
32174,"So people go around without masks or social distancing, and people die by the thousands."
32175,Jesus Christ... the headline downplayed the stupidity of it??!
32176,?
32177,"They have but things like kidney transplants, emergency surgery can’t be paused."
32178,What frustrates me to no end is plastic surgery is still being allowed to happen and when their cases go awry we have to deal with them in the ER.
32179,"The fact that people who don't give a shit are free to do what they want while others who cares about others are ""free to stay home"" is what is wrong with humanity."
32180,My reasoning was that only the fact that a tes company partially sponsored the study cannot be used as a reason to invalidate the study.
32181,There are much better ways to validate or invalidate a study.
32182,I did not make any assertions about the validity  of the study.
32183,"Also no assertions about tea curing or preventing Covid, come to think of it I'm not even sure that the study does."
32184,So stop being smug and sarcastic about points which I didn't make.
32185,Used to live in Arkansas.
32186,Was convinced southern hospitality was a thing.
32187,"For all intents and purposes, it was, until the pandemic."
32188,Wife and I got so sick of the selfishness and idiocy that we moved to the suburbs of Chicago.
32189,"While there are still idiots here that don't give a shit, compliance and education seems much higher here."
32190,I use Skype.
32191,Just wanting to see family members is not a legitimate reason to travel.
32192,"I normally go home every 2 years, but I most likely will not, and cannot go home this coming summer."
32193,I refuse to go to the US to visit until it gets it's nonsense under control.
32194,"Adding in to the mix that the US healthcare system is a whole trainwreck, and I just cannot be bothered to go bankrupt if I get sick while visiting home."
32195,"Also, over 24 hours of travel in a mask around possible virus carriers?"
32196,"What if I get infected and fet my family sick, and they die?"
32197,"No thanks, I will stay home."
32198,&gt; now how to talk to these people?
32199,complete waste of time
32200,"Know what, you're right, that's definitely comparable to a country of 1, 400,000,000 reporting 4 thousand deaths despite being ground zero."
32201,I see that now.
32202,Brainwashed morons.
32203,"To clarify, the issue here is that there are 2 different counts reported by 2 different agencies, one using national data, and one using data reported from regional governments."
32204,"The Russian government still uses both, and it isn't like this is new information."
32205,RosStat numbers are reported on a monthly basis.
32206,&gt;To give a  background.
32207,"There are two  separate government bodies - RosStat  (statistics), and RosPotrebNadzor  (consumer rights)."
32208,The first is  responsible for general statistics and  the second for C-19 handling.
32209,"&gt;  
&gt;RosStat   when it comes to raw numbers is quite precise."
32210,"They might ""cheat"" in   some compound stats (like inflation), but how they do it is mostly   public as they publish their methodologies."
32211,"To count deaths, RosStat   collects its data directly from ZAGS (offices responsible for   registering all newborns and deaths)."
32212,"&gt;  
&gt;RosPotrebNadzor   numbers are collected in a different way."
32213,They aggregate data which is   reported by each \*region's government\*.
32214,"As local governors have a say  in  it, some of them underreport or simply fake it."
32215,"There is a nice  article  with good visualization - [check this one for example](https://zona.media/article/2020/11/23/120k) (in Russian), unsurprisingly the most notorious are Chechnya, Dagestan, and ""friends""."
32216,"&gt;  
&gt;So,   back to the article."
32217,"It says ""Russia admits...""."
32218,"No, it doesn't."
32219,"The   only difference now is that one of the ministers, when asked directly,   said that RosStat isn't wrong and that both numbers are correct, and the   difference comes from the fact that RosStat and RosPotrebNadzor have   different methodologies."
32220,No changes in the way how RosPotrebNadzor   numbers are counted is announced.
32221,"&gt;  
&gt;As for RosStat numbers, they're available with a slight delay at the end of each month."
32222,"Any anti lockdown anything gets labelled as alt-right or trump loving, which I'm not at all."
32223,And then you get shamed by either work or the people in your life.
32224,So many people seem to support restrictions forever.
32225,I don't want to lose friends but it looks like with everything locked down we are drifting apart anyway.
32226,I don't know anymore.
32227,"Over 11.4 million doses of COVID-19 vaccines distributed, 2.1 million administered: U.S. CDC

That is a SUPER SLOW ROLL OUT USA style!!"
32228,!
32229,killing themselves one person at a time...
32230,That's not too bad.
32231,They could very well be one the first countries to see a substantial effect on deaths/hospitalisations from the vaccines if they carry on at this rate
32232,It takes two..
32233,"If a major world war was occurring now, I think the fatality rate from COVID-19 could have creeped up to level seen in the Spanish flu."
32234,Alot of public and private initiative is being used to staunch the bleeding in this pandemic which would drastically cut if another type of public disaster was occurring at the same time.
32235,"...they think Jesus is behind that......

edit: I meant Satan.... got my myths mixed up"
32236,Nonviolent drug offenders should be released.
32237,Violent criminals... no way.
32238,My mom is a nurse in her late 50s.
32239,She got the first Pfizer shot over a week ago with no symptoms at all.
32240,There's more than just the act of eating.
32241,"Allowing for outdoor dining, making delivery easy, cutting delivery fee, SUPPLEMENTING lost income."
32242,Businesses leave when they are not heard or neglected.
32243,Why not care about both?
32244,What you're doing is straight whataboutism.
32245,You can care about Trump being a terrible leader and at the same time criticize Fauci for lying about masks.
32246,"There is a subset of America that actually listen and take due to what people like Fauci say, regardless of what Trump says, like myself."
32247,"Gosh, you win."
32248,So tiring arguing with someone who just circlejerks their own ego.
32249,"Cute, ignore all of my other points and hyperfixate on one point."
32250,"You obviously live very comfortably and don't understand other countries, besides your own."
32251,"But yeah, add a new argument and disregard other bits so you can come out looking smart."
32252,I applaud you sir.
32253,You have officially made your point.
32254,Congratulations.
32255,Have a virtual bump of an elbow...
32256,I have my livelihood to care about.
32257,I won't agree with you and you won't agree with me.
32258,I'm just glad you're a random on the Internet.
32259,I'll forget you in a week.
32260,"Bye :)

Tired retail worker."
32261,Yeesh.
32262,"So possibly take a few days off work or plan it during off days, then?"
32263,Yeah I’ve never felt anything close to that after a vaccine.
32264,"nearly all of the other western ""democratic"" capitalist states are fucking up to a very substantial degree."
32265,the favorable comparison to the *major* fuckup that is the US response is undoubtedly a major boon for european politicians.
32266,Definitely a term that would cause confusion!
32267,Thanks for the clarification.
32268,probably the best news regarding canada's vaccinations i've heard in weeks.
32269,hoping you guys get a mostly normal summer.

32271,"I got the rabies vaccine over the summer, definitely felt like shit after the first doses (a whole like 5-6 shots) and the second booster."

https://news.wbfo.org/post/cuomo-urges-federal-government-get-covid-19-vaccine-black-brown-communities

So what are you talking about?"
32273,Children won’t be getting the vaccine
32274,"They don't know what the one dose was producing, that's the point of a blind study."
32275,The double dose trial is to hedge their bets.
32276,"Parents got the moderna vaccine yesterday in Fort Collins, Colorado."
32277,They are both 80 but neither has any underlying health issues.
32278,Dad said old farts like him were streaming into the clinic for their shot.
32279,Colorado has already started their 1b phase.
32280,Expect interim data in early January and then them to seek approval in late January.
32281,I bet it'll be approved some time in February if the vaccine isn't a flop
32282,Gotta admit...
32283,"I read that first sentence and was thinking, “right?"
32284,"What if I want a beer after work lol”

And then your next sentence I was like, damn."
32285,He’s right.
32286,And the next?
32287,Damn.
32288,He’s right.
32289,And on and on.
32290,And now I feel like a bad person for my first thought.
32291,Have to point out that the systems were very carefully designed to specifically break under preassure.
32292,Is writing letters to our officials the only way to push for this to be fixed?
32293,Oh no!
32294,Not your nose picking finger!
32295,"Well, shocker there"
32296,"Yeah, they even started producing the vaccine before the tests were complete, knowing that they might have to bin it all if problems were found."
32297,What day did they go from a thousand deaths a day to 2.
32298,"If you are looking at that sharp jump off a thousand deaths that was the day they retrospectively added some deaths that hasn't been diagnosed correctly previously, an adjustment."
32299,It wasn't actual deaths in that date.
32300,"Many countries have made similar adjustments, nothing nefarious about it."
32301,If you had followed the news at the time it was well discussed.
32302,See if they can vaccinate you outside.
32303,And make sure you are wearing full ppe.
32304,(other than the arm)
32305,Not to mention much more life lost per death from Spanish flu at least.
32306,The average age of death of a Spanish flu victim was 28c compared to covid’s 81.

**There is currently no legal possibility to demand the wearing of a mask - nor will the new pandemic law make it possible as it stands now."
32367,"** **This is what Karin Åhman, senior lecturer in law and co-author of a consultation response to the bill, says."
32368,"**

On Friday, the Swedish Public Health Agency said that they plan to recommend mouth protection during rush hour in public transport from 7 January."
32369,How and when the recommendations will apply have not been announced yet.
32370,"In a message to DN, the authority's spokesperson Anna Wetterqvist writes that more information is expected to be in place shortly."
32371,"**The moderate traffic region councilor** Kristoffer Tamsons, who is chairman of SL and the industry organization Swedish Public Transport, applauded the recommendation."
32372,“That a recognized capable tool lay untouched in the toolbox has appeared increasingly strange.
32373,Anyone who wears mouth protection in contexts where it can make a difference shows their fellow human beings consideration and consideration.
32374,"It does something right and proper, ""he wrote on Facebook last Friday."
32375,Tamsons has been positive about mouth protection since last summer.
32376,"But he does not want SL themselves to make any recommendations, but believes that it is a task for the government and expert authorities."
32377,"DN has asked the politician for an interview, but he has declined."
32378,"**A recommendation** , which the Public Health Agency is now working on, is not legally binding - and you do not risk a penalty if you do not follow it."
32379,"France, Germany, the United Kingdom and Spain, among others, currently have mask requirements in certain contexts."
32380,"In Berlin, you get a penalty if you do not wear a mask in the subway."
32381,"The WHO advocates worms in cramped environments, but the Swedish Public Health Agency has maintained that there are no clear facts that it has an effect on the spread of infection."
32382,"Politically, the Moderates, Christian Democrats and the Center Party want the government or the Public Health Agency to introduce general advice or recommendations on oral protection."
32383,The Sweden Democrats want to [see demands for it in public transport](https://www.dn.se/sthlm/sd-infor-krav-pa-munskydd-i-kollektivtrafiken/).
32384,"However, there is currently no legal possibility for the government, the Stockholm Region or the Public Health Agency to decide on strict requirements for wearing the protective device in public places or in public transport."
32385,"That is the opinion of Karin Åhman, senior lecturer and expert in public law at Stockholm University."
32386,"\- For that to happen, you need to go through the Riksdag and enact a new law."
32387,**The government** recently **drew** up a proposal for a law that will give more leeway to be able to fight the coronavirus.
32388,"Among other things, it wants to be able to sharply limit the number of people in shopping centers and public transport."
32389,The bill is out for consultation now.
32390,"But Karin Åhman, who wrote one of the consultation responses together with colleagues at Stockholm University, points out that the proposed pandemic law does not enable oral protection requirements in public transport or in other cramped places - but needs to be clarified in the bill."
32391,\- The bill aims to reduce congestion.
32392,And you do not wear masks to reduce congestion.
32393,"We wrote a supplement that one should consider including that question in the legislation if one would be interested in such a measure, says Karin Åhman."
32394,"Private companies, such as shopping malls and restaurants, are free to ask their visitors to wear masks today."
32395,"\- A store can write on a sign that you must have a mask to enter it, and ask customers who do not have a mask to leave."
32396,"Public companies, such as theaters and museums, and public transport companies can also urge their travelers and visitors to protect their mouths and noses without it becoming a legal obligation, says Åhman."
32397,\- In the same way that SL writes that you should keep your distance and avoid going by public transport if you do not have to.
32398,But they would not have the legal right to evict someone who does not wear a mask.
32399,But those saying it was a hoax got their shots... looking at a certain governo from South Dakota...

32608,"I suspect, based on his repeated and freely admitted moving of the “back to normal” goalposts, that this is what Fauci wants too."
32609,Nothing official now but the research doctor said they will likely enroll people into a small study of those that received 2 different vaccines.
32610,"Thank you for that, much appreciated!"
32611,"So there were no other nurses, doctors or healthcare workers, risking covid everyday, in this hospital that could have had the extra dose first?"
32612,Hang in there.
32613,The vaccine will be ready before you know it.

32619,"I mean, you're right, but I think what u/KingMode5932 was getting at is that Covid is, in a sense, when you step back and try to dispassionately assess the situation, relatively ""benign"" (I hate even saying that!)"
32620,"compared to a hypothetical virus that's spread even more easily but has a 33.3% death rate, or that ""targets"" children and young adults."
32621,"If you NEED to drink, try something like red wine because it has some properties that may counteract the inflammatory properties of the alcohol."
32622,Try really hard to drink as little as possible.
32623,"If you are an alcoholic, now is not the time to go cold turkey."
32624,Do not stress your body more than necessary.
32625,It doesn't help that we have a complete buffoon at the helm of all this who doesn't really care about what's going on in the country.
32626,It's going to be a mess for Biden when he get's sworn in and that 100 million in 100 days promise is going to look real bad.

32650,"There is nothing in that article that says that those epidemiologists think that things will never go back to normal in terms of restrictions/lockdowns etc, though."
32651,"I mean the article starts off with this: 

&gt;Even with coronavirus vaccines on the way, many epidemiologists do not expect their lives to return to pre-pandemic normal until most Americans are vaccinated."
32652,"Further down one of them says this: 

&gt;“I think widespread availability of vaccines will result in the further relaxation of most precautions by mid-to-late summer 2021.”

There isn't a single quote in that article that backs up your statement that you think that Fauci wants society to stay locked down permanently."
32653,"The only thing that I see that even comes close is this: 

&gt;“I expect that wearing a mask will become part of my daily life, moving forward, even after a vaccine is deployed,” said Amy Hobbs, a research associate at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health."
32654,"Which, okay, but you were talking about 'restrictions' continuing and also restrictions getting 'tougher', a reference to people wearing masks doesn't really seem to back that up."
32655,"I get your worries, I just think that they're unfounded."
32656,Fauci wants more people vaccinated to improve the 'bubble' that will offer protection for years to come.
32657,That's it.
32658,That which can be asserted without evidence can be dismissed without evidence.
32659,You've provided none on either of those statements.
32660,"It take two shots, 3 weeks apart."
32661,And yes it doesn’t magically activate immediately once you get poked by the needle.
32662,Takes a few weeks/days at least
32663,Exactly.
32664,The effort we’ve put into making sure everyone stayed home should’ve been supporting those vulnerable and elderly.

32674,"I'll say it: if you literally require alcohol to live, you've made a shit choice and can deal with the so sequences."
32675,If rather devote resources to innocent people during a pandemic when there is evidence this will save lives.
32676,I also have little tolerance to those who abuse alcohol.
32677,Fuck them.
32678,Growing up with those monsters is a nightmare.
32679,So sorry for your loss and my condolences.
32680,Sometimes I feel like the whole vaccine announcement came too early (not that it could've been any other way).
32681,"You know that it will take ages, everyone says it, but it doesn't make the wait easier."
32682,Pretty sure they unblinded those studies no?
32683,That’s usually what they do after the trial.
32684,Do you know how long after the second dose it takes to get 95%?
32685,I remember seeing 28 Days Later in theaters and feeling somewhat comforted that a real-life Rage virus could be contained by sealing off Britain and waiting for the zombies to starve.
32686,But that was all a fantasy.
32687,Some VIPs would get on the last Eurostar train before the lockdown really went into effect and then a train full of zombies would pull into Paris.
32688,Are you saying that’s a bad thing?
32689,Nothing you said sounds bad to me
32690,"If you have an opportunity to get an earlier vaccine, yes, they will unblind you."
32691,Or we are used to dealing with an administration that lies or intentionally slows any covid response.
32692,It's far more likely to believe we are way behind.
32693,He's saying that achieving herd immunity is not the only way that we can have a positive impact on the pandemic.
32694,"It seems to me that you are pessimistic about the ability of vaccines to reduce transmission of the disease, which would in fact be the way that we get out of this pandemic without getting to herd immunity."
32695,"I might be missing something here, but it doesn't seem like an agreeing perspective to me."
32696,"For the record, I would shocked if a vaccine can reduce symptoms and not have any sort of beneficial impact on transmission."
32697,"They are open in places, including two in my state RI."

32880,Flu vaccination is done over about 3 months and covers 9m people over 65 (around 75% of about 12m people).
32881,So roughly 3m/month.
32882,(I couldn't find figures for the under 65).
32883,The UK probably can triple that rate so I believe an estimate of 2m per week is possible.

32901,I got chicken pox in 1994 at 15 years old after managing to avoid it my whole childhood.
32902,The vaccine became available in 1995.
32903,Just look at want happened after sandy hook.. oh wait.
32904,Yeah it wouldn't matter.
32905,These antimask type people were around during he spanish flu too and that was much more deadly especially with the less sophisticated medical care of the time.
32906,And people still wanted to end the lockdowns and go on with their lives.
32907,"&gt; I hope your immune system holds strong

Or not if it starts doing the 'attack your own organs' thing"
32908,I remember thinking around the beginning of this that the field of immunology is about to jump at least two decades ahead in the next year.
32909,I don’t think I was wrong.
32910,Small spade?
32911,Cmon man I would need a fuckin snow shovel to hide my poops
32912,Because young people are generally poor and don't vote.
32913,"All the money and votes comes from the rich so if blame gets put on their doorstep, say goodbye to campaign donations."
32914,"There's still a travel ban to UK citizens travelling directly from the UK, so nobody can travel without an exemption anyway."
32915,"This new testing policy only applies to the very few who actually can travel from the UK to the US now, of which I doubt many are doing so for tourism"
32916,‘Barely felt it’ boy if I had a nickel everytime a woman told me that...
32917,I feel like  most of reddit is not that rich since so many people talk about how they are struggling and need government help right?
32918,It feels like months and days ago simultaneously.
32919,Go back to China please
32920,"Obviously it *is* much worse, but presumably getting one doesn't negate getting a different one (much like getting COVID doesn't negate getting vaccinated)."
32921,Vaccines are about community protection.
32922,"For a long time it's going to be ""take what you can get,"" and if people abide by that, then community risk goes down."
32923,I'll take 8 times higher risk compared to someone with an mRNA vaccine compared to 20 times higher risk without it and probably 100+ times higher risk if the infection is rapidly circulating in the population while I wait.
32924,"For the acute phase of the pandemic, while infections are sky high, getting an extra 100-200M doses into people's arms will be helpful."
32925,Refusing one type of vaccination isn't going to make the other magically available for you.
32926,Yeah so that makes the numbers tolerable right?
32927,Almost as staged as her “phone call” to Biden that she posted on Instagram.
32928,“We did it Joe” my ass.
32929,Each state is going to handle it differently.
32930,"California, for example, has worked out the first few tiers:

32931,I am sharing this comment with /r/cringetopia
32932,Hope it wasn’t an upper jab
32933,100% of people addicted to alcohol will experience withdrawals.
32934,It’s just how addiction physically works?
32935,It depends on how bad though but alcohol withdrawals aren’t something to play around with bc it can be deadly with how much impact it has on your heart.
32936,It’s why alcohol rehab facilities usually check on patients every 15 minutes during the night with a flashlight.
32937,Better chance of catching seizures or other signs.
32938,But yeah big picture I guess most would live.
32939,Then again most live through Covid so who knows just a numbers game.
32940,psychosis brought on by infections is not new to epidemiologists
32941,Yes they will monitor you for 15 minutes or 30 minutes if you have had allergies before.
32942,"It’s a pretty simple solution if you do react, an EpiPen reverses it almost instantly then you would be taken to the hospital for monitoring."
32943,It’s serious but always fixable.
32944,"Also very rare, about 1 in 200,000 so far"
32945,"When I got Bell's Palsy it was from a viral infection, which is what it's usually associated with."
32946,Wouldn't surprise me if an immune response from the vaccine could cause a similar reaction.
32947,Cleared up in a few weeks and fortunately never returned for me.
32948,"I agree with you that you'd have naysayers, but I also think OP is foundationally correct that the *proportion* of naysayers would be significantly less if the virus was as lethal to children as it was the elderly."
32949,Prepare to get banned from this sub.
32950,We legalized recreational weed here in January so finding the right edibles have helped haha 😂
32951,I know covid is real and wear a mask everyday.
32952,Including when I’m at the gym.
32953,The gym is not the problem.
32954,0 outbreaks.

32965,My father in law died Sunday evening.
32966,I cannot wait to be vaccinated.
32967,They cancelled James Bond so we can live it instead.
32968,Wait for what reason are we not prioritizing old people and those who are old with comorbidities???
32969,"They are by far at the biggest risk level

I mean seriously, is it not obvious that in order to reduce deaths as much as possible give the damn thing to those who need it the most??"
32970,Study out of Isreal showing that if we vaccinate those over 70 we cut the fatality rate by 3/4!!!
32971,If that's the case vaccinate starting with the old and let's open this mf'er up!!

33028,It does.
33029,I was just being so hopeful.
33030,"March will still look better, nonetheless."
33031,This year I had the opposite - I just had zero energy about 3-4 hours after I got it.
33032,That's usually the first hint that I'm getting sick.
33033,"Went home, took a nap, felt great the next day."
33034,Great.
33035,You still don’t have a right to force masks on people after they have been vaccinated and reached appropriate levels of immunity.
33036,"When the vast majority of the public has been vaccinated, the restrictions must go away."
33037,"It’s not a “part of my identity” to complain about masks, but you cannot force it on me once I am vaccinated."
33038,Period.
33039,Ok but what about those who die from corona?
33040,Why is a death by corona when it’s a 75-yo with heart issues more sobering than one from the corona vaccine?
33041,I had thought antivaxxers had already claimed that she died two weeks ago.
33042,"The great irony of all this is that in the 19th century Britain and France were on opposite sides of the public health debate, with Britain prioritizing doctor-patient confidentiality and France pushing mass public health intervention, even if it violated individual rights."
33043,"The international anti-vax movement actually had its roots in the UK, which would send speakers to the US lecturing on the dangers of vaccines."
33044,And now we have 80% of Britons willing to get vaccinated against COVID and half that percentage in France.
33045,It's a dramatic role reversal for the nation that pioneered public health.
33046,&gt;The family of an Indiana pastor is mourning this holiday season after he and two other close family members died of COVID-19 in the days leading up to Christmas.
33047,"&gt;  
&gt;Pastor Jim Applegate, 54, led the Westview Christian Church in Campbellsburg for more than 20 years and was the first family member to die, on December 20, after being infected with the coronavirus."
33048,"Just 12 hours later, his mother, Pat Applegate, died, as did his sister MaryJane Applegate, 59, on Christmas Eve."
33049,"&gt;  
&gt;""Despite doing their best to take precautions, they all became sick and things progressed so quickly."

33051,"Nick has been the youth pastor for over the past five years and is trying his best to watch over the church and its members in his father's absence,"" Mariah Applegate, the wife of Jim's son Nick, told *Newsweek* Tuesday in an email."

33063,Maybe as much as three-and-a-half litres or 240% of your RDA!
33064,Consume as part of a healthy lifestyle!

33066,There’s that and they also have a history of lying about potential global pandemics.
33067,I would say the VP is an essential person

33079,Its not just sets.
33080,I work in post and we are also taking pretty significant precautions.
33081,I have not been in the office since April (except for two weekend excursions when the building was empty).
33082,I have had one employee who contracted COVID while playing golf but we have not had any breakouts within the company.

33087,"Meanwhile in my country, what little russian doses arrived are already melting before being injected."
33088,This year has been the shortest decade
33089,I know I would.
33090,Then I'd polish it off with a tall cool budweiser.
33091,&gt;I’ve wondered why we haven’t seen much footage of COVID in hospitals.
33092,I certainly understand why they would be required to blur faces of people who can’t or don’t want to give consent.
33093,But we see much more images of warzones than we have seen of the horror that’s befallen our health care system in this crisis.
33094,"&gt;Well, the Trump administration has made sure we won’t see it

&gt;Trump knows that if it isn’t on TV it doesn’t exist for many Americans, especially his followers."
33095,"It’s unlikely that Fox or Newsmax would show much of it, of course, but they might see some of it in passing while they’re out in bars and restaurants or traveling to visit family."
33096,&gt;Here in LA the hospitals are overflowing and we have seen some pictures of make-shift waiting rooms in the parking lots and people being treated in the gift shop and lobby.
33097,It’s scary.
33098,"I think for a lot of people, it’s no longer just COVID that scares them but the idea of something else happening and the hospitals not being able to adequately treat them."
33099,"(Don’t get COVID, but don’t have a heart attack or appendicitis either!)"
33100,Maybe if more people saw this they would take it more seriously.
33101,Blame your mental health issues on the governments ridiculous and worthless lockdowns.
33102,I didn't realize you had to wait 3 weeks between the two!
33103,Damn we really need to mass produce a 1 shot vaccine.
33104,Ya.

33108,"“LMAO FUCKING BOOTLICKERS”

33129,"If there are any new ones, it's certainly nothing that has been talked a lot about."

33138,"As someone from the UK, can someone explain to me how the US is determining who gets vaccinated when?"
33139,"Here it’s done simply by age, and also for certain professions like care-workers and nurses."
33140,No politicians have had it because they’re not old enough.
33141,"In the US it seems all politicians are getting it first, regardless of age."
33142,"Is that because politicians are considered an important group, or is it simply that they have the money to buy early access?"
33143,1.
33144,Im not saying that a vaccine that reduces symptoms wouldn’t impact infection rates at all.
33145,"It probably will, even if its just by lowering viral load."
33146,I’m saying there is no *proof* yet that it eliminates transmission which if it didn’t would mean we couldn’t bank on the herd immunity factor alone.
33147,2.
33148,"Yes, i am agreeing."
33149,"By vaccinating people and thus eliminating severe progressions we can declaw the virus, freeing up ICUs and saving lives."

33162,I don't mean all states doing the exact same thing (though maybe all acting under the same guidelines).
33163,I mean all people taking it seriously and moving towards a common goal.
33164,"Objectively, the US did as much testing and as much lockdown as pretty much any other non-island industrialized nation."
33165,"For a country that had basically no hope of eradicating the disease (too widespread, even by March), the measures we put in place were actually on par with other countries."

33185,This is the right answer.

33187,They asked and you answered.
33188,"The only thing is current CDC says 10 days, not 14 to quarantine after possible exposure, or 7 days with a negative PCR test."
33189,I have been basically locked up in my house and boat trying to avoid the people down here.
33190,Starting with the Gov it sure seems like there's a lot of billy bob wisdom going around.. Was a good time to move south and so glad I brought the boat.
33191,Otherwise I'd prob have gone nuts by now.

33193,"I'd figure as people are exposed to it in increments, the 1st exposure or shot would be the worst."
33194,"To prepare,  I'll be sure to keep my work schedule light after each vaccine... just in case."
33195,"Prepare for the worst,  hope for the best."
33196,Not sure.
33197,I believe how they measured it but I couldn’t say for sure.
33198,"You're looking forward to being a test subject for an untested, new vaccine that could have horrible life changing or even lethal long term effects, and you're excited about it?"
33199,Thanks for being that guy.
33200,I appreciate your sacrifice.
33201,Vaccines take years to create and test until they can be used safely on people.
33202,They've had about.. 4 months on this.
