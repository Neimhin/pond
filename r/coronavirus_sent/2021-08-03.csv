1,"Read it over again: the religious, medical, and 100% remote exemptions will stay in effect."
2,The only temporary exemption is the “it’s not fully approved” exemption.
3,That one expires once the FDA grants approval.
4,This is the same system many universities already use for requiring vaccination records for MMR and similar.
5,Schools have done this for years.
6,"If it’s not forever, what’s the end goal when we can simply move on with our lives and treat this like the viruses we live with yearly?"
7,"The numbers no longer justify these measures, unless we plan on treating the flu the same way now."
8,Because the flu doesn't cause overwhelmed ICUs in the middle of summer.
9,Because people on Reddit like to panic tbh

17,So 0 out of what 200m doses?
18,"Decent odds, I’d say."
19,Close to multi state lotto jackpot odds.
20,I'm holding out judgement until that preprint the CDC based part of their policy around has been savaged by peer review.
21,"There's a lot of people parroting that the vaccinated spread delta just as much as the unvaccinated thanks to the CDC, and I would like to at least see studies that can collaborate the claim better than ""About 100 people vaxxed and non-vaxxed, who breathed the same air had the virus in their noses, so that means they spread it equally."""
22,"and ""A bunch of vaccinated people at a standing-room only indoor venue breathing heavily while dancing and mingling in close proximity to each other represents the everyday risk environment for a vaccinated person's capability to spread the virus."""
23,I see those claims as a stretch in logic.
24,I like that.
25,Let’s refer to the willfully unvaccinated as the dirty people.
26,They’re a literal danger in our society.

28,"Wow, that was easy!"
29,"Any other vaccine hesitant people out there who would like your questions answered, in a non-judgemental way?"
30,"It’s insane to make anyone do anything, just because you want them to."

32,McLovin!

Key word ""claims""."
59,He also claimed a bunch of other BS.
60,I appreciate the band standing against stupid.
61,From what I’ve seen with asking around it doesn’t seem like it will.
62,"And it isn’t even sure if it’s vaccine avoidant, one study that wasn’t peer reviewed found that it could be."
63,"This is like talking to a brick wall, very taxing."
64,"Let's assume you are 100% right, and no one under the age of 24 can spread it."
65,Are all of your teachers under 24?
66,Staff?
67,Students?
68,"What about those in a master degree program, doctorates, etc?"
69,Surely there are people OVER the age of 24 at the university.
70,"And the reason you are wearing a mask and having a required vaccination mandate is not because of asymptomatic covid spread, it's because of breakthrough delta variant spreads which we are seeing pop up all over the country, including nearby in [Provincetown] (https://www.pbs.org/newshour/health/study-vaccinated-people-who-got-breakthrough-infections-can-carry-as-much-virus-as-others)."
71,"Even vaccinated, you can catch it."
72,"Even the [CDC updated their guidance](https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2021/07/29/cdc-mask-guidance/) citing ""It cites a combination of recently obtained, still-unpublished data from outbreak investigations and outside studies showing that vaccinated individuals infected with delta may be able to transmit the virus as easily as those who are unvaccinated."
73,"Vaccinated people infected with delta have measurable viral loads similar to those who are unvaccinated and infected with the variant."""
74,"Try to stay safe in class, friend."
75,I am SO happy to have read this article.
76,I’m nearly 43 and completely skipped a period two months ago.
77,"Wasn’t particularly stressed, just assumed it was perimenopause."
78,Now realizing the timing was after my second dose of Pfizer.
79,This is very useful information!
80,"I’m pro-vax, but a heads up about this possible side-effect would have been nice."
81,"(Also, happy cake day!)"
82,"Too many people assume it’s like Plague, Inc."
83,"I forgot to bring mine for the second dose, so now I have to carry around TWO of them."
84,maybe this will be the impetus for all the karens and bobs to get militant about everyone getting vaccinated
85,Well vaccinating children does seem to divide experts as well.
86,Many countries aren't planning on opening it up to those below 18.
87,Also what the BACK TO SCHOOL crowd wants too.
88,Let's not act like everyone isn't ignoring what's about to happen in schools next month.
89,It's the sensible thing to do.
90,No reason dirty people should be permitted to mingle with clean people.
91,Thanks!

94,But those numbers seem similar to the much less contagious version?
95,I was mostly just surprised the experts seem to still have hope that this could be slowed down when people are no longer staying at home or social distancing.
96,"I haven’t heard this described in a way that’s simple enough for the average American to understand (not sure how it is elsewhere in the world) until another commenter on this sub said something the other night… basically, at this point, it’s a matter of either getting sick from covid, or getting the vaccine."
97,But of course regardless there will be people who proudly choose the former...
98,So many people I know are on the fence about the vaccine and are just listening to what the people around them who are convincing them not to.
99,The shit spreading out there is just as poisonous as the virus.
100,I don’t think it’s fair to just dismiss these people as stupid.
101,"I think these are the people who need to be targeted with the messaging, not those of us who did the smart and socially responsible thing."
102,"I also can’t believe kids under 12 STILL cannot get vaccinated, but that’s another story."
103,"We are doomed, and the damned is putting the blame on everyone but themselves"
104,Its 93 degrees where I am right now in Oregon and we are still pretty much fine.
105,Apparently DeSantis doesn't realize it's summer in North America right now?
106,"People are wearing masks inside again though here and we are the most vaxxed county in the state, so case numbers are still low."
107,I wonder if there is a correlation.
108,During the crisis there were a few disreputable Chinese companies exploiting it with knockoffs or expired product for a very short time.
109,"But China got pretty strict about that, in their unique way."
110,When I buy KN95s these days I'm pretty confident in the product.
111,"But if you need that level of confidence, pay the extra for N95s (the regulated US standard) from a vendor on the AMA approved respirator list."
112,"Yep, there might be an increase in uptake due to the full approval."
113,"However, the real benefits will be entities more comfortable with requiring the vaccine, along with doctors being able to prescribe a third dose off label."
114,What makes you say that?
115,What the actual hell did they think was going to happen?
116,"I think Ireland is the only place where a vaccine pass has been introduced without the option for a negative test, whose intention wasn't to increase uptake."
117,I really don’t think this is reality for good.
118,"I feel like we’re all still nervy from last year and justifiably angry about people who haven’t gotten vaccinated, but this isn’t forever."
119,"It will peak in the south, then move elsewhere."
120,We're far bigger than the UK.

123,I'm just trolling.
124,I think it's insane to pressure someone to take an experimental chemical for a virus that's not much different than the flu.
125,Totally understand that.
126,But risk is mitigated when all are vaccinated.
127,It is less likely that people will be infected if they are vaccinated.
128,We postponed for a year and it looks like corona is going fo be with us for the foreseeable future.
129,At this point I’m at the living with it and mitigate it stage.
130,Nice!
131,It's the go to whenever I get takeout and the provided hot sauce or salsa is lacking.
132,"The problem isn't unvaccinated people, the problem are people who are going around in a pandemic without wearing proper protective gear for themselves and others."
133,"This is a criminally-negligent and sociopathic thing for anyone to do, and they've been told by what should have been credible authority that it's A-OK to do it."
134,And so they're doing it.
135,The entire discussion about who has or has not been vaccinated is a MacGuffin because the real story is that vaccinated people are silent carriers and transmitters of this pandemic and the number of COVID-positive vaccinated people is being underestimated at the aggregate level of mid-government by up to an order of magnitude.
136,"And now we have people making conclusions based on bad data, and that's not just me saying that."
137,"""CDC's most recent published data says that as of July 26 there have been 6,587 hospitalizations among fully vaccinated Americans and 1,263 deaths."
138,"Research by NBC News indicates that the number who have been hospitalized or died has already passed 7,300 in just the 30 states providing data."
139,"While some states track breakthrough cases meticulously, others — like Missouri, where cases are surging — lack ""quality statewide data,"" according to state officials."
140,Other states are choosing to only release partial data.
141,"Robert Long, spokesperson for Maine Department of Health and Human Services, said, ""Those who have been fully vaccinated and have a breakthrough case but are not symptomatic and not part of a regular testing protocol may never be captured in these numbers."""
142,"Critics of the agency like former FDA Commissioner Scott Gottlieb, said federal officials are failing to capture the overall scope of infection of Covid cases."
143,"Gottlieb told CNBC Friday, ""I suspect probably one in 10 infections is actually getting reported."""
144,(from [https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/breakthrough-covid-cases-least-125-000-fully-vaccinated-americans-have-n1275500](https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/breakthrough-covid-cases-least-125-000-fully-vaccinated-americans-have-n1275500) )
145,They *may* not reduce transmission *if* you get infected with Covid.
146,"But they make it less likely for you to get infected with Covid in the first place, thus reducing your overall risk of transmission."
147,Or just shows that reddit flips the fuck out anytime it encounters anything even slightly not a lefty opinion.
148,"I guess since you did your research on him very deeply, you saw that one of the fields he studies is clinical trials, so you would think he would actually be a decent expert to weigh in on the quality of the study the CDC used."
149,Okay so we coerce people into getting vaccinated now (unethical in itself).
150,What next?
151,COVID-19 is not going away and variants will emerge around the world no matter what we do.
152,Your “no covid” goal is delusional and you are simply asking for restrictions indefinitely.
153,The goal should have been to get vaccines to those who want to protect themselves and to get hospitalizations to a manageable level like a yearly flu.
154,Mission accomplished.
155,"That wasn’t the point… but if that’s the game you want to play okay, they also require kids to get the chickenpox vaccine, a disease which kids who are healthy and not immunocompromised have a virtually 0% chance of dying from."
156,"Polio is just a example of a vaccine that is required for kids, not the only one in the state of NY."
157,Too bad part of the misinformation out there makes people who want to have a baby or are due for one somehow think it’ll mess you and your chances up for one somehow or linked to some sort of ailment.
158,How dumb have we become to believe in this bs.
159,Ever been to a DMV the past few years and see the lines?
160,Did you ever try to call the DMV and got someone on the line within 15 minutes?

181,Wish they'd all go get themselves vaccinated
182,Scientists have to look at each new variant and decide if it's worse.
183,Reporters have to look at that science and decide how to get clicks out of it.
184,If we didn't have delta lambda might matter.
185,But as of now only delta matters.
186,"More concretely, alpha was the fastest spreading voc for a long time."
187,Iota and maybe some other late arrivers matched it.
188,Gamma spreads even faster and is definitely worse.
189,But both alpha and gamma are very rapidly being displaced everywhere by delta - vaccines completely crush them.
190,And lambda is being displaced by gamma; it's much less contagious than delta.

Almost 72,000 children and teens caught Covid-19 last week -- a ""substantial"" increase from a week earlier, the American Academy of Pediatrics reported Tuesday."
311,"The group counted 71,726 new cases from July 22 - 29."
312,"That is a ""substantial"" increase from the nearly 39,000 cases reported a week before, and five times as many kids who were sick at the end of June."
313,The definition of a child varies by state but generally includes those up to age 17 or 18.
314,"After decreases in reported cases over the past couple of months, the July numbers started trending upward again as the highly transmissible Delta variant of the virus became dominant in the country."
315,"""That's high and considering the fact that we are vaccinated now, what that's telling us is that unvaccinated people are getting infected in higher numbers because the virus is more infectious with the Delta variant,"" said Dr. Yvonne Maldonado, chief of the division of infectious diseases in the Department of Pediatrics at Stanford Medicine and chair of the AAP committee on infectious diseases."
316,More than 4.2 million kids have tested positive for Covid-19 since the start of the pandemic.
317,Children and teens represented 19% of reported cases in the latest weekly data.
318,"The report comes as schools have just started or will soon start, with some requiring no masks or social distancing, and as cases in many parts of the country are surging and hospitalizations at levels not seen in months."

351,I'm assuming they're implying total number of cases (denominator) would be lower if more people were vaccinated (which is true).
352,"Thus the number of cases of kids having active covid cases, if constant, would be a higher % of the total number of cases."
353,"But this doesn't account for that if total number of cases were down, fewer children would be contracting covid, so it's impossible to determine if the % would be higher or lower."
354,The % doesn't matter though.
355,The goal should be fewer # of kids (and people) getting covid.

407,The 90% effective isn’t measured against being in close contact with an unmasked highly contagious infected person.
408,That number is based on how many infections people got in the study which was done at a time of high mask compliance and distancing.
409,They didn’t lock vaccinated people with unvaccinated infectious people for 10 days  to see the results.

441,Hopeless countries are always going to be dealing with COVID and new variants will always be forming.
442,The only way America stands a chance is to require people to be two weeks past their final vaccination in order to fly into the country.
443,And we need to secure the border as well.
444,That solves the issue with outsiders.
445,Getting Americans to get vaccinated is far more tricky.
446,We just need to hope that the anti-vaxxers die off quickly so the rest of us can get back to living our lives.
447,"This is probably a really dumb question, but I would have thought nearly everyone in Indonesia is indigenous?"
448,"The 20% statistic for long covid is referring to people who still have at least one symptom after 30 days, if I'm recalling the study correctly, but when most people talk about long covid colloquially they're talking about the much smaller group of people who are basically disabled several months after having the virus."
449,To say that 20% of people get long covid without clarifying your definition of long covid isn't really fair.
450,"For example, my cousin (unvaccinated) had issues with his sense of smell for a couple of months after getting covid."
451,"He would never describe himself as having had long covid, but this study would."
452,"My province is still testing anyone who wants it, plus a lot of people in specific professions and what we're finding is that (from June 10 to July 26th at least) 95% of cases, 99% of hospitalizations, and 99.5% of ICU admissions are in the unvaccinated."
453,Delta is the dominant strain here.
454,"Obviously I do not want covid, but being vaccinated changes the risk calculation in my mind."
455,"I'm not attending large indoor gatherings and I'm glad my province is maintaining a mask mandate for the foreseeable future, but I'm also seeing family and friends again, and playing sports."
456,"&gt;We needed to irradiate COVID at the start of this whole mess, back when very few people had it."
457,"But big business prioritized short term profits, so they pushed governments to get things reopened as quickly as possible."
458,I agree with this 100% but we are well past the point of that being a possible solution.
459,Is this what the CDC and the White House would rather talk about than come up with an action plan?
460,"I don't need to know what Dr. Fauci is scared of, I need to know how we're going to handle these kinds of scenarios and just how likely they are."

468,"Ah, yes... A Texas tradition older than Texas itself."

672,Why the oxygen issue though?
673,Is it supply issue or last mile delivery issue or is it being smaller you don't get bulk delivery?
674,Coronaviruses actually mutate relatively slowly compared to other viruses.
675,"Studies have shown that it mutates about half as fast as an influenza virus, and a quarter as fast as HIV."
676,This gives scientists a little more time to react to new variants that are discovered.

764,All those places say you don’t need an ID but to have your insurance card.
765,They then say if you don’t have insurance the government will pay.

795,I had to dig into the article to learn that antibody treatment isn’t given in the ER or to severe patients.
796,It has shown promise to people who are given the treatment early (as was the case for Trump).

884,"We have a small sample set showing similar nasal viral loads, but there’s not much justification for using nasal viral loads as a proxy for likelihood of transmission."

1160,My specific concern in this case is that it appears there is an inefficiency in this specific scenario:  Pfizer announced their clinical trials for under 12's a long time ago.
1161,"The FDA remained silent on the quantity of children included in those studies, until Pfizer met with them recently and the FDA said that they needed to include more children."
1162,Given the demand of parents desperately trying to get their kids in these clinical trials it seems like it would have been very easy to add those people if the FDA had given that guidance back in the Spring and they could have been a few months closer to approving the vaccine for kids under 12 by now.
1163,"&gt; You can’t skip over important steps, you just can’t."
1164,I definitely don't want safety to be compromised in these studies.
1165,"However, the recent delay gives me the impression that someone dropped the ball -- either Pfizer for not knowing what the FDA expected and not contacting the FDA to get clarifications, or the FDA for not being up front with Pfizer about what was needed."
1166,There are other possibilities like some new data arose that required further studies to account for (e.g.
1167,if the dosage looks like it needs to be changed) but I haven't seen any information along those lines to indicate why the FDA is asking for these additional children this late in the game.

1300,"I will always love their music but in between them selling their catalog and it being 2 dudes and Pete and Todd as hired on employees it feels just like a fake

Edit before the S-Storm: Shades of gray and clearly I’m being facetious."
1301,But their newest album was disappointing to say the least
1302,I guess all is hyped too much as long as cancer deaths count as covid deaths when covid is detected (in austria) so the data the goverment uses to justify their steps is basically wrong.
1303,The person might well be wrong about having antibodies from a previous infection.
1304,No one knows how long natural antibodies last or if they're effective against Delta.
1305,"Yes, many people ate in restaurants pre-vaccine."
1306,They were just as unprotected as the unvaxxed are right now.
1307,Some of them likely contracted Covid as a result of eating in a restaurant.
1308,A subset of them probably died.
1309,I think he should listen to his doctor.
1310,"The lead singer may be a molecular biologist, but he doesn't have Pete's medical history."
1311,"&gt;""Pfizer said in a statement to NBC News it anticipates results on its clinical trials in kids ages 5 to 11 sometime in September, and then could apply for emergency use authorization."""
1312,"Once it's approved, I seriously doubt that families whose kids are in school who dont mask now will happily explain to anyone who asks, they don't trust it, they trust others ."
1313,Just watch out for you and your family.
1314,"Check out the 10th plague Exodus 12 12-15, that describe an virus causing bleeding in all."
1315,The marauders would not enter a house with dripping blood on the doorposts an lintel.
1316,That would be walking into the arms of the plague/pandemic.
1317,"My understanding is that its more along the lines of ""regardless of what vax you got, you can go get a booster and its just this one booster"" Rather than, ""you can only get a booster if you had phizer or moderna and you have to make sure you get company's X booster if you got vaccine Y""."
1318,Is the messaging really that complicated?
1319,"No, but people are dumb especially around this so just keep it simple so its effective."
1320,This is one of the only cases where one of the people behind this dismissal (Holland) most definitely knows more on this topic than the average GP.
1321,"He literally did his doctoral research based on a paper he coauthored studying mRNA, which also has not been shown to interactive negatively with GBS at all."
1322,"If you post in the wrong thread, just delete instead of editing."
1323,[removed]
1324,I don’t think people should have to be coerced.
1325,There are legitimate reasons to not get the vaccination but they are so rare that they shouldn’t be a problem.
1326,"Everyone else needs to stop being big babies and take the fucking thing so there aren’t 135,000 new cases everyday."
1327,"The number of reasons that people should probably not get the shot add up to a small minority that would be protected by herd immunity


I’m not expecting to get sick, but because there are still people spreading it around, I have to worry about being an involuntary payload vessel to people who aren’t vaccinated."
1328,I’m glad for the Israeli team that another study is confirming their findings.
1329,Kind of a bummer they’re finding the same thing after all with delta.
1330,Was hoping the 60% efficacy wasn’t our new number.
1331,Sounds like sending kids back to school with delta and no masks is going to be a lot different this time around.
1332,Jesus christ read the entire article people...
1333,"I think they already had conspiracy theorists in Utah try to invade an ICU to ""prove"" it was actually empty."

1335,"Also, I have yet to see anyone who calls it ""the jab"" be someone who got vaccinated."
1336,foolishness
1337,My dad had IBS and JJ vaccine was okay for him
1338,Virtual/remote school taught us that we’re all different.
1339,Some kids need a classroom while others can learn 8 hours of regular material in 4 hours.
1340,"We don’t value education, we value state-sponsored babysitting so parents can work/contribute to the economy."
1341,The year was 1979
1342,[removed]
1343,Dexter Holland is quite literally a genius.
1344,This was the right move.
1345,and the J&amp;J vaccine *barely* helped with that in the U.S.
1346,Me too.
1347,"Due to chronic lung issues, I can't send them back to school until they are."
1348,Bruh.
1349,https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#hospitalizations
1350,"If the R0 of Delta is 7-9 as recently claimed, then it should burn through the population relatively quickly."
1351,"If one person infects roughly 10 others, you go from 1000 cases to 10,000 to 100k to 1M relatively fast."
1352,So it does its thing and then we move on?
1353,No the fuck he doesn't.
1354,He polled at 0%.
1355,Guy has no chance in hell at becoming the face of the Republic party.
1356,"I have zero problem with the unvaxxed being banned from restaurants, gyms, movie theatres, etc."
1357,"Yes, it especially sucks for folks with legit medical conditions who can't get vaxxed, but it's safer for them to stay home at this point."

1366,"No, it does not say that."
1367,**That's what the nurse herself told the radio station**.
1368,"There is no independent confirmation that the doses were in fact ""also going into the bin""."
1369,"FTA:- 

&gt;The woman was working for a contractor hired to administer vaccines in aged care facilities when she used three leftover doses that would otherwise have been discarded, **she told 2GB on Monday**."
1370,"Yea, shit, you're right."
1371,"To be honest the idea of passing a potentially deadly virus to anyone, vaxed or not, and harming them gravely is horrifying to me."
1372,I’m super frustrated at the few people I know who are refusing the vaccine.
1373,There are 3.
1374,"None of them are stupid, none of them are malicious and none of them deserve to die."
1375,They have been convinced to hold vaccine skepticism that I personally find ridiculous.
1376,(Two are traditional medicine practitioners that I used to trust.
1377,I can no longer work with them.
1378,One is a friend who has been pulled into conspiracy theories by an addled partner).
1379,I actually also find most religious views ridiculous.
1380,"But I don’t think people that hold those views deserve to die horribly, even when their behavior is extremely damaging and troubling (not taking their kids for medical care, doing genital modification on babies, fighting birth control options for others)."
1381,These things are bad but don’t merit the death penalty.
1382,It’s hard with the anti vaxers because their beliefs and behaviors harm others and they’ve pretty much created a devastating health crisis that could at this point be averted.
1383,"Many of them are awful, selfish and ignorant."
1384,I still don’t wish suffering on them and I still care if they are harmed.
1385,I hope I can be protected from them and the variants they create.
1386,I hope my parents at their assisted living facility aren’t killed by breakthrough infections passed to them by unvaccinated staff (WHY won’t that place mandate shots for the workers???).
1387,It is upsetting to see people saying they hope that or do not care that the unvaccinated suffer or die.
1388,"I admit to being extremely angry and afraid at the crisis they are causing but I wish for them to change their ideas and behavior, not to suffer."
1389,"Although I sometimes want to punch some of them, I refrain."
1390,I don’t mind wearing a mask.
1391,It’s helped my asthma by keeping out cold in winter and pollen in summer.
1392,I also feel like it gives me a sort of privacy though I like to smile at people.
1393,I do so outdoors.
1394,"The first reason people get vaccinated is to protect themself, not to avoid spreading it."
1395,There are no evidences they lower the probability of spreading yet.
1396,"(hope thats a correct sentence)
Here in austria we have Pfizer/Biontech, J&amp;J and AstraZeneca and no one claims to prepare against it nor studies can proof it (atm)."
1397,I decided to let my baby vaccine against the most common diseases.
1398,"Not to protect others, but herself."
1399,Good luck and I wish you the best!
1400,"No, it compared a 3/4 and a 5+ week window."
1401,It looked at the sample of participants which had OVER a 5 week gap between Phizer’s 1st and 2nd dose
1402,the deaths happen about 3 wks after the cases are reported tho
1403,Anybody know what is going on with moderna?
1404,What are you talking about?
1405,"The US has had three approved vaccines for months, and they’ve advised most people to take them."
1406,"Per the [CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccinesafety/ensuringsafety/monitoring/vaers/index.html), the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) is used to collect reports of adverse events after vaccination from the general public."
1407,This is primarily used to identify potential topics to further investigate with regards to vaccine reactions.
1408,"However, because the event data in VAERS is often not verified and is often self-reported, it should not be assumed that the adverse events in VAERS are actually associated with or cause by the vaccines, nor is it possible to estimate the frequency of these adverse events from these data."

1412,"Quick google reveals this:

&gt;  Approximately 100 reports of suspected GBS were experienced by 12.8 million subjects who received this vaccine."
1413,The cases were more common in men and patients above the age of 50.It is important to understand that the reporting system used was the VAERS system (Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System).
1414,"This is a passive reporting system whereby patients, families and health care providers can report a case of GBS."
1415,"In past studies, patients were reported as having GBS when the disease was later determined to be another disorder."
1416,"&gt; 
&gt; More than 100 million adults in the United States have received the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines and no increased incidence of GBS has been found after those vaccinations."
1417,"(No risk at all from mRNA Moderna and Pfizer, so he had options)."
1418,"&gt; 
&gt; The FDA has reiterated its stance that the known and potential benefits of the J&amp;J vaccine clearly outweigh the known potential risks of the vaccine."
1419,The GBS/CIDP Foundation supports this stance.
1420,One must keep in mind that the vaccine is highly effective against COVID 19 and the delta variant.
1421,"Source:https://www.gbs-cidp.org/covid-19-vaccines-and-the-gbscidp-community/

Their mission statement: The GBS|CIDP Foundation is committed to sharing the most accurate information from the world’s leading experts, many from our Global Medical Advisory Board."
1422,The COVID-19 situation changes daily and we will continue to share updates that are vetted by the experts in GBS.
1423,"In addition, we are in regular contact with the FDA representing the patient voice in the top-level decision-making."
1424,We understand that there are many opinions creating confusion so please consider the source of your information before drawing conclusions.
1425,"As always, all decisions should be made with your personal physician based on your own health."
1426,"Man I have been an Offspring fan since like 1997-98, so I didn't want this to be true at all, and I also didn't want to be misrepresenting the situation here."
1427,"I can't believe the band, with such a knowledgeable mRNA expert as their frontman, gave this guy no options."
1428,"From the article sited above there have been zero ZERO GBS cases caused, or exacerbated by over 100M doses of Moderna and Pfizer mRNA vaccines."
1429,"In addition, it has widely been studied and the risk of GBS being caused by J&amp;J, which is very small is drastically outweighed by the health benefits provided by the vaccine from COVID and most importantly Delta."
1430,THIS IS SUPPORTED BY THE FOUNDATION FOR GBS AND THEY SUPPORT THIS STANCE.
1431,This dude is scum.
1432,"He is hiding his anti-vaxx stance behind a medical reason, which does not exist."
1433,"That is worse than being straight up anti-vax IMO, both are bad to be fair, but there are thousands of people who wish they could take these vaccines and have no control over whether or not it is safe for them to do so."
1434,This coward hides behind a ohh well I found a doctor who said I shouldn't take it.
1435,We also had a quack testify in the midwest that the vaccine makes you magnetic by sticking a spoon to the surface tension on her skin... You can find people to say anything.
1436,Even a cursory google search that took me about 15 mins blows holes in this guys story.
1437,"He fucking has 2 safe options to take the vaccine, that are 100% safe."
1438,"He chose not to do this, and hid behind the medical reasons excuse when there is no science to support it."
1439,"This guy deserves everything he got, and honestly worse."
1440,"There are so many people who have legitimate reasons they can't get this, my best friends SIL is in chemo for stage 4 breast cancer and has had a double mastectomy, people who have had organ transplants, these people are counting on the rest of us to do the right thing to keep them healthy."
1441,"People like this hide behind dubious reasoning to back up their anti-vaccine stances, and continuing to give Delta the ability to spread and mutate even further."
1442,"I honestly had some sympathy for this guy reading his statement it seemed pretty legitimate until about halfway down, there it kicks into just about every anti-vax and Q keyword there is."
1443,"From there I decided to dig into this further, and it turns out the odds of negative outcomes for GBS are almost zero, and even for the vaccine that has a tiny chance of causing it, the foundation that studies the disease says it outweighs the risks; and to boot there are two other vaccine options with different mechanisms of action who HAVE ZERO CHANCE OF CAUSING GBS TO FLAIR UP."
1444,"This dude got what he deserved an deserves to be called out for what he is, a coward hiding behind a false medical risk, who continues to put all of us at risk, while also giving the people with legitimate medical reasons a bad name."
1445,Are there not enough vaccine doses in Australia?
1446,There was just an article in the local paper where I live (USA) about vaccine doses needing to be thrown away because they expired and no one wanted them.
1447,I also read that many county health departments near me had stopped ordering additional doses due to people not signing up for appointments/showing up for appointments.
1448,My state sits at about 52% unvaccinated last I checked.
1449,"That nurse obviously needs a refresh on protocol and rules, but in my opinion firing a nurse for trying to save people is a horrible idea."
1450,I live in the Bay Area.
1451,"Where are you getting the data that cases here are anywhere close to as bad as LA/SoCal (which generally have lower vaccination rates than up here), let alone places like FL/TX/LA/MO/etc?"
1452,"Yes, cases have gone up, but we're at around the same level as early last summer and we never really got hit that hard until maybe in January like everywhere else in the country..."
1453,"I once waited almost four hours with a stab wound, waiting to get stitches, before Covid happened."
1454,I can't imagine how long it would be for something like that now.
1455,"I was pregnant and got overzealous cutting brownies and the knife slipped, went in the side of my hand and the blade exited the back."
1456,It was an uncomfortable wait.
1457,My husband fainted when he saw all the blood lol

1459,"My dad ain't like that, man."
1460,He's the sort of person who brags about having gotten through school without ever reading a book.
1461,"He thinks he has a ""common sense"" that is superior to any kind of externally acquired knowledge, from books or otherwise."
1462,"Trust, if that was the kind of conversation we were having, I wouldn't have put a total embargo on any political discussion out of him at all."
1463,He doesn't know shit about *the* science.
1464,"Only that Facui ""lied"" about masks once so we can't ever believe any science ever again."
1465,Good!!
1466,I got to see more of this in the news
1467,"Everytime we think something is being hyped up too much by the media, it isn't."
1468,First there was the OG Coronavirus.
1469,There were a bunch of memes being posted on Reddit about how the media was overreacting back in early 2020.
1470,Then March happened.
1471,"Then when the variants started appearing, people were insisting that everything was going to be fine because we had vaccines now, and that the the media was once again making a big deal out of nothing."
1472,Then the Delta variant happened.
1473,"I'm not saying that we should always trust the media, because we really shouldn't (especially with FOX and CNN doing everything they can to sow doubt in vaccines), but we need to stop underestimating this thing."
1474,They had some really fantastic articles/threads like the guy who wanted to see how long he could continue to get paid without actually doing any work at his job.
1475,About a year as it turns out.
1476,Their second life articles are second to none.
1477,I just remember Second life had a guest speaker doing some sort of virtual lecture for hundreds of people.
1478,Then the Something Awful goonsquad showed up and made it rain penises.
1479,Not sure why you’re being downvoted.
1480,Young people (millennial and gen z) are lazy.
1481,I should know as I’m in between gen z and millennial.
1482,And that’s true with every generation when they were young.
1483,Young people have the Lowest voter turnout in every election.
1484,Now they’re too lazy to get vaccinated.
1485,"I’m sure everyone here, if they know young people, know a few that haven’t gotten the vaccine because they are lazy and put it off."
1486,I remember when the vaccine was made available for young people everyone was saying the percent of young people getting vaccinated was lower because young people just became eligible compared to the elderly…well it’s been many months now and us young people are so lazy.
1487,"Again, not hating millennials/gen z specifically."
1488,"If covid happened when the boomers were in their teens/20’s they’d be lazy bums, too."
1489,"And even if these migrants are infected with covid, isn't the resounding message from conservatives that it's not a big deal?"
1490,So why do they care if they have the virus that's not a big deal?
1491,Ahem.
1492,Some of us watch *House*.

1494,This shit sounds way too familiar.. Southern California checking in.
1495,[removed]
1496,"so you agree with coercing people into getting a medical procedure that, statistically speaking, provides little benefit for a good chunk of the population?"
1497,Do you really think that “i support informed consent” is nonsense?
1498,"Maybe if he had just kept the mask on and not made a complaint about personal freedom to not get vaccinated, he’d still be in the group?"
1499,"He apparently got the Rona last year, so I can’t say with any medical backing that the vaccine would do any worse to him…"
1500,Haha reddit hivemind say 0.1% of population dying to disease is bad; 0.1% of population dying from vaccine complications is good.
1501,"I can‘t find the report now but the risk was small, I think something like 1% of cases in the time frame studied were reinfections with alpha and 2% were delta."
1502,"This was in all cases, not specifically looking at children."
1503,Overall good news.
1504,"Would liked to have seen Pfizer / AZ breakdown, especially for hospitalization"
1505,Given the cultures someone's eventually going to shoot up a hospital because they turned away their loved ones.
1506,Butthurt much?
1507,"It was a simple explanation as to why people would use GBS, not a defense?"
1508,Why don't you google GFY
1509,not OP but i actually convinced people after getting covid while vaccinated.
1510,they saw how sick i was and i just said i can’t imagine how much sicker id be without the vaccine.
1511,of course it helps that they actually know me
1512,Diaper mandates incoming
1513,The real problem is there are still enough unvaxxed people in some cities that a breakout could overwhelm hospitals and lead to people dying of things other than covid.
1514,That and the production of variants is why it's not as simple as just letting people decide if they wanna get vaccinated.
1515,Why would someone who legitimately can't get the vaccine want to put themselves at serious risk by going to a gym?
1516,"Hm, the only one I think someone would question is Sinovac."
1517,"If possible, it might be worth shopping around other sites in your area if that’s the only one available."
1518,"While I'm inclined to agree with you, it is like the first fifty results."
1519,My MIL had GBS and got the vaccine.
1520,She waited longer in between shots so she didn’t cause a flair up.
1521,What do you think about a booster shot?
1522,Is really necessary.
1523,I had some serious side effects after my 2nd dose and I am not looking forward to a 3rd one if it’s not necessary….
1524,The vaccine isn't approved by the FDA.
1525,"Is the lead singer smarter than the FDA, CDC, and WHO?"
1526,The whole concept of ths service industry requires minimum wage employees to deal with crazy people.
1527,"Maybe people should be banned for acting crazy towards service staff in general, regardless of covid?"
1528,I wouldnt be opposed to that.
1529,Japan is doing people in their 40s now right?
1530,So it seems like a lot of the most vulnerable people are already vaccinated
1531,"I’d like to point out that the people in question were given AstraZeneca, which offers strong protection against hospitalization or death but is far less effective in terms of preventing symptoms (particularly against Beta) than the mRNA vaccines are."
1532,That can possibly explain why these breakthrough infections happened.
1533,Or perhaps they assume  people read the article
1534,If there’s one thing we know about young people it’s that they’re lazy.
1535,"Lowest turnout in voting every single election, now lowest % getting the vaccine, etc."
1536,etc.. pure laziness.
1537,"See ya lata, Parada."
1538,Imagine destroying a partnership decades old because someone wouldn't take the -non approved--- treatment that you demanded they take.
1539,Well he did tie his own rope.
1540,But they still won’t give us a raise.

1545,The lives of people in vulnerable groups matter too
1546,The darkest days *so far*
1547,Plus he already has natural immunity from having already had covid
1548,You don't have to use the FDA approves one.
1549,They just waited for the approval to make them mandatory so people couldn't use that to argue.
1550,I can't believe George Bush Senior would just attack people.
1551,It's microRNA not messengerRNA though.
1552,the theory is that billions of immigrants are traveling all over the US and spreading covid and they are responsible for the surge in the Southern states.
1553,"You know, it wasn't the no masks or low vaccination rates, it was ILLEGALS!"
1554,"Even if this were remotely true, why wouldn't these dumbass govs be encouraging citizens to get vaccinated to protect themselves and their communities from covid from brown people?"
1555,None of it makes any sense at all.
1556,Evidence of this?
1557,I have seen nothing to suggest it’s vaccine evasive like Beta was.
1558,I don’t think your boycott of Dunkin’ Donuts is gonna hurt anyone.
1559,"So, is delta plus another name for the lambda variant?"
1560,I read in a Reuters story yesterday that it was supposed to be able to evade vaccinations a bit more readily
1561,Same with my five year old!!
1562,But to my GREAT surprised my local school board unanimously approved mandates.
1563,I was not expecting that
1564,I’d stay out of Republican restrooms when possible.
1565,Similar to India.
1566,Not sure what caused the dip.
1567,From bodies floating in rivers to things kinda going back to normal
1568,"That is false, if your place of work discloses certain kinds of health information, it's considered a HIPAA violation."

1572,"Says in the article, the doses were going into the bin anyway."
1573,Going through the proper channels would result in the doses also going into the bin too since theres no waiting list for leftover doses.
1574,Double win in the UK and Canada.
1575,Increasing the gap saved more lives too.
1576,"These are probably public policy issues then where the disagreement gets into economics or the culture wars, etc."
1577,"What I've noticed is that people who disagree with anthropogenic climate change theory don't say science is bad, but that ""*the* science"" is bad."
1578,"For example, they say that the data was manipulated to reach a foregone conclusion."
1579,"In this case, they aren't attacking science but the motivations of the people doing the studies."
1580,"Or, they attack the  grant funding model that--according to them--favors studies whose outcomes will support climate change theory."
1581,"And realy, what it comes down to is they probaby just have a different philosophy of how humans should react if indeed we are warming the climate."
1582,They are generally suspicious of top down solutions that don't take into account immediate short term economic pain in local economies.
1583,"And so going through studies with a fine tooth comb, looking for faults, is the solution."
1584,So you and your dad probably have a lot to agree on when science involves something besides these divisive issues.

1597,The vaccinated will be allowed in college and the unvaccinated might not.
1598,Quite fitting too since I doubt the anti-vaxxers would get far in a place of learning anyway.
1599,"Provincetown is a very highly vaccinated area, so naturally the percentage of recently infected people would be made up of mostly vaccinated ones."
1600,Same goes for other “certain areas” of high vaccination rates.
1601,"My neighborhood has a vaccination rate of about 86%, so there’s a good chance that the amount of people recently infected (if any) would be darn near 100% breakthrough cases of vaccinated people."
1602,None of this means that the vaccines aren’t working well enough or that vaccinated people make up more than a teeny tiny fraction of new cases.
1603,Actually it **would** be a sudden drop.
1604,"Population growths follow a logistic (not an exponential) curve whether the population is mice, humans, or people who've been infected with delta."
1605,"The derivative on a logistic curve (the rate of change, in other words, in this context - the number of new daily cases) is symmetrical - it goes down just as fast as it went up."
1606,The only surprise is *when* this peak happened and the relative sharpness of the peak.
1607,That it is falling as quickly as it went up is not in the least bit surprising.
1608,"However, there are several possible explanations of the ""when"": things like schools breaking up, a spell of really nice weather when people were spending time outside rather than indoors in unventilated places, the end of the euros etc., all of which were probably larger factors than night clubs reopening."
1609,"Here is a picture of a logistic curve (the red line) and its derivative (the rate of change, the blue line)."
1610,"In this context, the red line would be total who've been infected with delta, and the blue line daily new cases."
1611,"http://photo.alioth.net/tmp/Screenshot_2021-07-29_09-40-45.png

The idea that a population growth reaches a gradual plateau and gradual fall off is probably because if you eyeball the red line, it doesn't look like its gradient really starts shallowing until x=2."
1612,But in reality it started falling as quickly as it rose from x=0.
1613,Thank you for getting it!
1614,"&gt;nobody really knows what's going on

That basically sums up the UK Govenrment"
1615,Either one guy is getting jacked to the tits or they had a good old-fashioned bartering economy in full flow.
1616,They submitted the application a bit less than a month after Pfizer.
1617,[removed]
1618,I can't take this anymore guys.
1619,End it.
1620,"Having a fake id under 21 isn't just inherently ""cool"" for no reason, it's cool cuz you can buy fun booze for you and your friends before you're 21."
1621,No such factor exists for faked vaccine cards
1622,Every one thought we had covid beat in the spring
1623,"Not going to happen in some places, right now, without risking stupid shit."
1624,"Unfortunately, it looks like it's going to have to burn a few."
1625,[removed]
1626,That someone might be medically unable to get the vaccine.
1627,I understand that
1628,Folks are aware that this will be around for a long while.
1629,They're just coming around to the idea that putting their lives on hold indefinitely is likely to be more harmful than the disease (both to their personal mental &amp; financial health and that of their nation's economy).
1630,"At some point we're all going to have to learn to live with this disease, 90% of UK adults have antibodies against the virus (either through vaccination or having knowingly or unknowingly already had the disease) 

...so when it comes to reopening society many people are asking ""if not now, when?"""
1631,😡😡😡😡👊👊👊👊👊
1632,Good news: the original variant and the Alpha variant have been almost completely eliminated in the United States.
1633,"Unfortunately, the Delta variant is a lot more contagious."
1634,"And, realistically, that 70% number was never going to be good enough, it was just a goal Biden thought was actually achievable."
1635,[removed]
1636,I am not seeing US ever having another lockdown.
1637,Simple put there is no financial support for it .
1638,We are at the point where most that will happen is mask mandate might be issued and even that on shaky ground.
1639,If you get sicker quicker from covid your snicker won't get thicker quicker.
1640,I mean it causes erectile dysfunction.
1641,"Two questions:

1) Didn't the CDC just say that vaccinated people transmit the virus just like unvaccinated people?"
1642,"(And, in fact, isn't that the entire reason for vaccinated people masking again?)"
1643,"2) For how long should someone - who is ""medically fragile"" due to a historical medical condition - ""keep his ass at home""?"
1644,When will it be safe to come out?
1645,When will the danger of Covid have passed?
1646,🤔
1647,[removed]
1648,I'm sorry man but I saw way too many people forget card.
1649,"The back of card literally says to please bring your vaccine card to appointments 

And I was giving vaccines in Bay Area, a very educated area..."
1650,If that was your point then why didn’t you say that.
1651,Why bring up events that were over weeks before the decline rather than mentioning events that are on-going?
1652,"Also no, cases did skyrocket after those events but would not be expected to continue on that trajectory weeks after the event was over."
1653,The increase in R would not continue for 2+ weeks after the event was over.
1654,The decline was unexpected but the impact of those events (at least the euros) is pretty clear and unsurprisingly far greater than whatever events are going on now.
1655,Are you trying to argue that they didn’t have an impact or that the current events would have a similar one?
1656,"https://i.imgur.com/WBZiyTt.jpg

This is the message on the gringo bandits bottle."
1657,Not really.
1658,We have severe outbreaks in several totalitarian countries and we have absolutely no idea how China is actually doing.
1659,"What we do know, is that China is awesome in restricting the flow of information on the topic."
1660,"Also, it can certainly be assumed that a more open China would be far more advanced in its vaccination campaign."
1661,Not going to get through this until it's mandatory
1662,My unscientific analysis says that the Euros had an outsize effect on transmission.
1663,Which caused a very steep peak and fall.
1664,"Roughly 50 percent of the population watched the finals, and a good majority would have involved alcohol."
1665,"We are beginning to see a more gradual fall, which would be more in line with herd immunity effect expectations."
1666,"But I also think with high case numbers, the behavior of some people changed."
1667,Not everyone is desparate to be back to pre-covid level of socialising.
1668,Their right to not wanna.
1669,"More seriously, while it may not be what was argued in Connecticut, in Indiana the argument was apparently that it violated due process (below is the ruling from when the 7th appeals court said the vaccine mandates were fine

1884,How do you have School without constant qaurintines without mask wearing by students until they can be Vaccinated???
1885,A lot of places are opening the new School Year without requiring masks.
1886,"Even if kids don't get more severe cases, without masks and or vaccinations, huge numbers will test positive and there will be constant qaurintines in most places, with the exception of olaces with bat shit crazy Governors."

And the point about the latest wave hitting younger people:

""More generally, participants aged between 5 and 24 years were over-represented among infected people in our study, contributing 50% of infections (weighted age-standardised) while only representing 25% of the population of England aged 5 years or above \[12\]."

1889,Pete: You can't trust the Government.
1890,You have to do your own research.
1891,"Dexter: oh, I have!"
1892,Let's just use your numbers.
1893,100% of unvaccinated persons get COVID and 10% of vaccinated get COVID.
1894,You said that this will suggest a 90% efficacy.
1895,This 90% is dependent on the 100% and the 10%.
1896,It's hard to say how increased transmission affects the 100% and the 10% and so it's hard to tell how the 90% changes as well.
1897,"&amp;#x200B;

The bigger point is that you may not be wrong to say vaccinated has an increased risk now as well but the fact that you chose 25x as the number makes it seem like you are trying to multiply 25 to 1/25 which just doesn't make sense."

&gt;contributing to herd immunity,

You do realise the definition of this was changed recently and used to mean through vaccinations and people just getting the virus and their immune system dealing with it."
1912,Selfish because we don't want a vaccine.
1913,Lmao get fucked.
1914,IT IS a personal choice.

1928,The information you report on the form is what is submitted to the IIC.
1929,I was vaccinated at a major health system (not my workplace) and had a similar form to fill out.
1930,"My spouse and kids were all vaccinated at separate chain retailers (3 different chains) and also had a similar consent form, so this has been my experience with getting vaccinated in other situations, as well as my federal, state, and company training."

1980,Does anyone know if the full approval means vaccination status can be factored into your health insurance?
1981,Denial of coverage or higher premiums for the unvaccinated?
1982,I feel like this is fair and would act as a further incentive.
1983,Exactly and he’s also missing out logistics issues and issues related to administering the vaccine.
1984,That’s the majority of costs by the way.
1985,Who’s going to transport the vaccine and the syringes and the tents and the trained nurses to rural villages?
1986,And don’t forget the big powerful chillers needed to store the vaccines.
1987,Considering how many doctors are anti-vaxxers… maybe?
1988,Forreal.

2003,Secret Space Force so yeah I would agree with that
2004,"Not that I have had GBS, but my father and grandmother died of GBS and my uncle also had it but recovered (though not fully)."
2005,I still got the vaccines because COVID can also trigger GBS and the probability still points to getting vaccinated.
2006,"Additional note:  In my father's case, he had diabetes which caused a sore on his foot to become infect which caused a severe case of sepsis which triggered GBS."
2007,So there was a lot going on.
2008,It wasn't just a vaccine.
2009,(My uncle does believe his was caused by the influenza vaccine.)
2010,Thank you.

2024,No they are just less likely to be vaccinated and more likely to be actively going out/spreading it
2025,It's up to the discretion of a given business it seems.
2026,Theres no bar code they need to scan or anything.
2027,I imagine most will be cool with just a photo of a card
2028,"There is some legal precedent upholding the right of a business to mandate even under an EUA, but only a small number of cases in lower courts."
2029,"Most legal experts would say it makes no difference, but there is some looseness in the wording of the relevant statutes that at least gives an argument to the right to refuse."
2030,That has caused many businesses to be cautious on the advice of cautious lawyers.
2031,"Of note, the tests for COVID were under an EUA, too, but I don't think that was ever litigated."

2045,What's the ground truth of Delta down there?
2046,Zombush.
2047,Economy needs stability.
2048,The short repeated lockdown at the last minute are killing many industries.
2049,Shuting down a factory can cost weeks or even months of profits!
2050,"I would be able to take my kids far more places if everyone did wear masks until more people are vaccinated, and all you have to do to see vaccination rates are growing steadily is look at recent posts on this sub."
2051,"Right now, the County I live in, Schools won't even require them."
2052,"We have a really low vaccination rate in my area, and the way contact tracing policies  in my state work, even if my kids are wearing masks,  if a maskless child tests positive and has exposed them, that's a 2 week qaurintine."
2053,Which is two weeks they are stuck at home with no outside interactions and 2 weeks one of myself or my wife can't work.
2054,"On top of that, the 'I got vaccinated, I've done my part"" crowd is just as antimask as the antivaxers, which forces parents of kids to young to be vaccinated, to have to isolate their kids more than they would otherwise."
2055,You’ll be fine.
2056,mRNA vaccines completely leave your body very quickly.
2057,They need to be kept cold because they decay so quickly.
2058,Unless you had an immediate reaction there is no possibility of long term complications.

2093,"&gt; If it looks like half the population is having a shockingly different reaction to these jabs than was expected — it’s probably because their life experiences have actually been shockingly different, and their reasons range from a conscientious risk/benefit analysis, to the financial inability to take time off work/lack of health care in the event of potential side-effects, to an understandable distrust in a system that has never prioritized the health or well-being of their communities."
2094,Half the population is NOT having the issues he’s talking about.

2190,"It is Emergency Use Authorization, not Experimental..."
2191,Think of EUA as a form of approval during emergencies that can bypass the time-consuming bureaucratic steps required for full approval.

2193,Even priority review can take up to six months.

2216,We know it’s not an easy conversation to unfold.
2217,"If it looks like half the population is having a shockingly different reaction to these jabs than was expected — it’s probably because their life experiences have actually been shockingly different, and their reasons range from a conscientious risk/benefit analysis, to the financial inability to take time off work/lack of health care in the event of potential side-effects, to an understandable distrust in a system that has never prioritized the health or well-being of their communities."

2238,You liked the data that just wasn't making the point you thought it was.
2239,"From the disclaimer on the page you linked: ""The Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19)-Associated Hospitalization Surveillance Network (COVID-NET) conducts population-based surveillance for laboratory-confirmed COVID-19-associated hospitalizations in children (persons younger than 18 years) and adults."

2241,"The network represents approximately 10% of US population (\~32 million people)."""
2242,You're misinterpreting what that is trying to tell you.
2243,You could have figured this out on your own by looking at all the data on that page even without the reading disclaimer.
2244,"As an example, you said that the total hospitalizations of under 18s the whole pandemic was 3299 children."

2248,"Considering that not everyone who is hospitalized dies, and that there were 200k deaths from Covid in the US as of the end of Summer 2020 (I don't have the exact timeline) this means that this data is obviously not saying what you think."

2256,I am saying it because I want to you to be informed so you don't misunderstand this in the future.
2257,You should still be concerned.
2258,You shouldn't be telling people not to be concerned if doctors are.

2469,Are you saying he's lying about previously suffering from GBS?

2475,"Wait, They’re still making music?!?"
2476,!
2477,Agree.
2478,Some people are zero risk.
2479,Now that I’m fully vaccinated I’m much less concerned but still try to choose the less risky approach.
2480,Choose the restaurant patio bar inside.
2481,I hangout with vaccinated friends with no concerns.
2482,I never really enjoy crowded concerts or crowded places in general so it’s not hard for me to enjoy hanging out at a bar when it’s less crowded.
2483,Last weekend I was at a friend’s house in an area that is an anti-vax haven so delta is probably burning through that area.
2484,We went out to a bar but sat on the patio which was not crowded.
2485,I’m that location no way I would sit inside knowing many were not vaccinated and covid cases are high in that area.
2486,A bar in my area with high vaccination rates and much lower cases I’m much more comfortable sitting inside.
2487,None of this is zero risk but I can’t live a zero risk life.
2488,I did that in the early part of the pandemic and it was making me depressed.
2489,"Yeah, doctor in this case [doesn't jive with the CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/recommendations/underlying-conditions.html):

&gt;	People who have previously had GBS may receive a COVID-19 vaccine."
2490,"To date, no cases of GBS have been reported following vaccination in participants in the mRNA COVID-19 vaccine clinical trials."
2491,One case of GBS was reported in a vaccinated participant in the Johnson &amp; Johnson Janssen COVID-19 Vaccine clinical trial (compared to one GBS case among those who received placebo).
2492,"With few exceptions, the independent Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) general best practice guidelines for immunization do not include a history of GBS as a precaution to vaccination with other vaccines."
2493,J&amp;J had a single case in both the vaccine and placebo trial groups.
2494,"Not really compelling, and this dude's doctor is possibly full of shit."
2495,The UK has 94% of over 16s with antibodies btw.
2496,That is a better judge than vaccine rates.
2497,Also the US used the 3 week vaccine gap which means the protection will wane faster in the US.
2498,The UK used 8-12 weeks meaning we will be better protected for longer.

2533,Exactly.
2534,That paragraph makes me doubt that his doctor told him not to get vaccinated and I even doubt he had GBS.
2535,People lie all the fucking time including about their medical condition.
2536,I have zero reason to believe him.
2537,"In fact, I have reasons to doubt him since he sounds like an antivaxxers who is trying to find an excuse for getting kicked out for his shit."

2550,"It would be safer if the speed limit was 10mph everywhere, should we do that as well?"
2551,It's not just waning antibodies.
2552,Also the fact that Delta grew in prevalence from Phase 13 (May/June) to Phase 14 (June/July).
2553,From 80% of cases to 100%.
2554,So it may be (entirely?)
2555,attributable to the fact that vaccines are simply less effective against Delta.
2556,I bet you wear really complex patterns on your shirt.
2557,"Well if the vaccine can do that, the virus can do that too only with even more genetic material."
2558,Coronaviruses have one of the biggest RNA viral genomes known to man.
2559,I'd rather have just the spike protein added to my genome than the whole frigging virus.
2560,So link it.
2561,Why bother even replying without a link if its SOOO easy to get?
2562,"The ""efficacy"" that you are referring to in these ""studies"" is how well the VACCINATED deal with possible symptoms."
2563,Not with whether they simply don't get it.
2564,There is a difference.
2565,Being asymptomatic still allows you to transmit the virus.
2566,"So again, show the data that proves your statement, or continue with the logical fallacy of ""go find it yourself"", and I'll assume you have no clue about what you're talking about."
2567,You might as well not even reply back.

2579,"Your doctor is wrong, and vaccination is recommended for people with prior infection."
2580,You can be reinfected.
2581,There’s a surplus of doses in America and no need for those who had covid to go without protection to “save” shots for others.
2582,&gt;It's the sensible thing to do.
2583,No reason dirty people should be permitted to mingle with clean people.
2584,&gt;I like that.

2607,Exactly.
2608,It also has a lot of eugenicist undertones.

2611,Did you see the Maryland stats?
2612,3/4 of all covid cases are from vaccinated.

2615,No one should live in isolation.
2616,"Just fucking be smart, wear a mask, and get the vaccination."

2618,"You can't control them that easy and they are just kids, they don't understand."
2619,But it’s muh freedom .
2620,Being sarcastic of course..it’s only an issue because Trump turned it into one for political reasons.
2621,Makes zero sense to oppose it

2629,"They are crucifying the unvaccinated, and by the time they figure out how urgently confused they are about the nature of reality once again, folks will already be up to their necks in the next round of disinformation, manipulation, and deception."
2630,"They've been led on with lies since well before this began and it's beginning to look like a simple test: do you believe the government/political authorities, or do you believe the scientific ones."
2631,The government authorities in the USA and UK claim to be scientific but they distort the science.
2632,Those who cannot distinguish fiction from truth are destined to play an unwitting part in someone's narrative.
2633,"They're telling untrue stories with true words, it's an interesting phenomena to watch and appreciate firsthand after reading about it in the history books and wondering how people could be so badly hoodwinked."
2634,[removed]
2635,What is this rate really useful for?
2636,It seems reliable on the surface but it can easily change if you run lots &amp; lots of tests.
2637,"It's easy to force this rate to extremely low levels by just running lots of tests in a short period of time, assuming people will quarantine/mask up if they pop up positive."
2638,"Obviously testing isn't mandated on such a wide scale in the US, but it is an interesting thought process should repeated regular workplace &amp; school testing become mandatory."
2639,Am I missing something here?
2640,I heard that having a high positivity rate implies more testing is needed to catch missing cases.
2641,That’s a lot of words and a whole lotta inference to say “I can’t find a single documented case of asymptotic transmission in someone under 24”
2642,Yeah I think it's mostly a lost cause.
2643,Remember when Republicans scrapped that plan because they heard it would primarily affect inner city liberals (and were too excited about that to listen further)?
2644,Pepperridge Farm remembers.
2645,I don't understand why they would be afraid to work with him if he was the only one out of the group not vaccinated.
2646,He would be the only one at risk and they could test him every day.
2647,11k folks sick and rising hospitals a season does not sound sustainable.
2648,Jeaua
2649,No reason to expect the record to not break every day until they run out of hospital space in which to admit new patients.
2650,FL doesn't even have reactionary policy anymore.
2651,It's not nothing.
2652,"Even if you catch the delta variant, you're much less likely to experience severe symptoms or die with just the first shot of a two-shot regimen."

2654,Not sure your point.
2655,Isn't there /r/bikes for you?
2656,To be fair it’s not their responsibility to make sure that their guests are safe from virus anymore I think.
2657,"Either the people coming are vaccinated, the people sign a waiver of release of liability, or like here in Georgia (I’m from California) you have a sign at the door saying that you are at risk of sickness from the virus and you are responsible for your own well being."
2658,At this point if you’re sick or are unvaccinated and are still going out like this this is on you and shouldn’t have to put liability on the higher ups.
2659,It’s been 2 years nearly and if you haven’t gotten with the program be prepared to face consequences.
2660,[removed]
2661,I mean it’s kind of true?
2662,Everyone that I know that’s gotten Covid recently has been vaccinated.
2663,We’ve had more cases report at my work since this whole ordeal began and it defiantly coincides with reopening and ending social distancing
2664,"Yep, that’s what I said exactly."

2667,They shouldnt but what else can you do?

2670,Society shouldnt have to keep coming up with ways to accommodate them.
2671,Lol
2672,I... What?
2673,The entire population that is at risk is already able to get vaccinated.
2674,"90% age 65 and up are, and these are the people who were dying."
2675,Hence death rates being incredibly low.
2676,Children are not at risk.
2677,We didn’t start the fire.
2678,They aren’t flooding the hospitals in NY.
2679,Hospitals deal with periodic surges every winter.
2680,It isn’t March 2020 anymore.
2681,And did you know that the older age groups are more likely to have a higher percentage of vaccinations?
2682,"Those 75 and older are 85% vaccinated, while those 20 and 30-year-olds only about 25% vaccinated."
2683,Don't you find that curious?
2684,All of this winning the thanks to the governor
2685,"&gt; Dr. Jose Romero, Arkansas's health secretary, shared during the press conference that nearly 19% of all active COVID cases in the state are under 18 and that more than half of that number are under 12."
2686,"""Between April and July of this year there's been a 517% increase in the number of cases in people under 18 with a nearly 690% increase in cases for children 12 and under."
2687,"There's be an increase of nearly 270% in hospitalization among individuals less than 18 years of age,"" said Dr. Romero."
2688,Curious…Is it safe to go to restaurants (especially ones that are “popping”) and eat indoors if everyone in your party and yourself are vaccinated?

2725,Not to mention the fact that the jab is actually killing people and making people carriers.
2726,"But you've been I indoctrinated into this system for awhile now, hope your eyes open up soon."

2728,I literally don't care if you don't get the vaccine.
2729,"If you don't want it, that's fine."
2730,I'm looking forward to this virus taking out as many of the unvaccinated as possible.

2734,"I don't think it has to do with that, the drummer claims a legitimate health reason for not wanting the vaccine and the other bandmates feel unsafe around someone not vaccinated."
2735,What you’re describing is not happening in NY hospitals and deaths are ridiculously low.
2736,There is no actual emergency right now and this mandate makes zero sense in this context.
2737,I agree with your boyfriend that this is also an ethical issue.
2738,"The mayor here is actually asking CA residents go stay out of Vegas, one because the highway system in CA heading to NV can't support the massive amounts of traffic AND so many folks are coming here to spite the covid restrictions."

2744,"I do not understand how efficacy vs deaths can change from 91% to 100%, do they track new groups each month and recalculate?"
2745,That's a weird approach if so.
2746,I wish Reuters would provide the source...
2747,"The age distribution would be interesting to know as well because according to their [study](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2107715), the age groups of 60+ had 80%+ vaccination rates with the Sinovac vaccine, 50-59 group had 57.5% fully with 12.6% single shot (meaning that they are now around 70%+ with Sinovac most likely) and younger groups had far lower vaccination rates."
2748,"Therefore, Pfizer &amp; AZ shots are going to be heavily skewed towards the younger population."

2801,"True, those still wearing masks are in the majority in shops - but pubs and clubs are fully open, and the same people will go and meet their mates for a couple of pints, and talk face to face for about two hours unmasked!"
2802,There's certainly a degree of cognitive dissonance.

2805,"Obviously I wasn’t in the meeting to discuss it but it’s a global Fortune 500 company so it’s no surprise they’re gonna err on the safe side regardless…..
   Something happened a few weeks ago that really solidified policy amongst the private sector and it’s quickly becoming a standard…..Perhaps a warning of liability issues and health insurance companies gonna look at unvaccinated as a high risk due astronomical death rate compared to vaxxed."
2806,"Even the politicians have gotten on board on board as it seems some republicans have changed their tune, and that doesn’t happen for no reason."

2808,I’m sure barring them from public services will not make them more suspicious and will make them embrace getting vaccinated.
2809,"Yes, I’m being sarcastic."
2810,"""St. Lawrence County is among 1,600 counties around the country that elect its coroners."
2811,"They are paid employees; they make about $6,000 a year and get health insurance."
2812,They don't do autopsies — that's done by the medical examiner from a neighboring county.
2813,Coroners do pronounce people dead and sign death certificates.
2814,You don't have to have any medical training to be a coroner here.
2815,You just have to live in the county and be old enough to get on the ballot.

2830,"However with the extra security around, my normally sucky cell phone service is on point 

We are still in a pandemic right 🧐

I did get an invite, however I declined due to social anxiety."
2831,"You once again gloss over the fact that you are punishing not the person who didn't get vaccinated, but you are punishing their families."
2832,That is not right.
2833,And maybe you don't understand that some families depend on that money to be able to have a funeral for their loved one.
2834,Don't give a flying f if I get downvoted by all the over-dramatic righteous Covid social justice warriors on here.

2840,If no one was in contact with each other the virus wouldn't spread.
2841,“Could” ???!!!

2843,Delta is crazy scary unless you're vaccinated.
2844,If you're at 90% of 18+ vaccinated things are gonna be great.
2845,"My stepdad in Jacksonville was scheduled to have an outpatient heart surgery procedure at Baptist Medical on Thursday, and it’s now been postponed at least a month due to: the hospital is at capacity with COVID patients."

2847,"They'll end up selling their property to large investment banks, creating a even bigger problem for homeowners/renters down the road."
2848,"Based on article sounds like figuring out booster shots has been a mess:

&gt;	At the same time, senior health officials at the F.D.A."
2849,and other agencies are grappling with whether at least some people who are already vaccinated need booster shots.
2850,"Several officials are arguing that boosters will be widely needed before long, while others contend that the scientific basis for them remains far from settled."
2851,"&gt;	Two people familiar with the deliberations, speaking on the condition of anonymity, said that if booster shots are needed, the administration wants a single strategy for all three vaccines currently authorized for emergency use."
2852,"&gt;	Different recommendations on boosters for different vaccines, they said, could confuse the public."
2853,Fully approving a vaccine and then authorizing a booster for it soon after might also offer conflicting messages about its effectiveness.
2854,The great thing is once it receives FDA approval doctors will be free to prescribe a third shot off label.
2855,That’s not possible with an EUA.
2856,"&gt;	Roughly 3 percent of Americans — or about 10 million people, by some estimates — have compromised immune systems as a result of cancer, organ transplants or other medical conditions, according to the C.D.C."
2857,This is a lot larger group than I thought it was!
2858,Maybe.
2859,Maybe not.
2860,I’m not an epidemiologist so I can’t predict that.
2861,Once you're vaccinated the worst is over.
2862,This has been true since the first trial results came out 10 months ago.
2863,Ireland is doing great.
2864,Other places not so well.
2865,"Variants can emerge from the not doing so well places, if I understand correctly."
2866,But hope they will not be vaccine- evading variants.
2867,"You’ve done well Ireland, hope you can feel a little relaxed."

2872,Any false positive stories on binaxnow home tests?
2873,"My 2 year old (runny nose, sneezing, wet cough) got a very faint positive, then took another one that came up negative."

2880,Or does he even have kids?
2881,The point of it is to get people vaccinated now.
2882,There are zero deaths in NY now because there was zero covid a month ago.
2883,It entirely remains to be seen (and could easily go ether way) whether there will be any covid in September.
2884,"If the measure ""works"" then there will not be and it will ""not be needed""."
2885,"I might be wrong, but I think that was a Pfizer announcement, not a peer reviewed pub."
2886,Two months ago compared to now is a very different time though.
2887,Delta is dominant and infecting people more easily and numbers are climbing everywhere.
2888,"As someone who is fully vaccinated, I wasn’t worried about covid at all two months ago, now is a very different story."
2889,Public health experts said Black Lives Matter riots don’t cost any spreads (that was last year when the virus was at its deadliest) so I don’t see who this is going to spread anything.
2890,You’ll be alright.
2891,What does safe and effective have to do with the right to choose?
2892,"I am trying to figure out why paying money is preferable to getting the shot for them, and all I can come up with is avoiding the side effects."

2906,"My city 2 weeks ago had 77% fully vaccinated, 72% with 1 shot."
2907,Hopefully it's increased by a percent or 2 (or more).
2908,We went 5 weeks with no infections.
2909,"Then it was 1 in 130, next week 1 in 70, next week (this week) 1 in 43."
2910,So still around 2% positivity rating.
2911,But rising.
2912,I'd hope it peaks out soon.
2913,"It's just crazy that the solution is free, widely available to everyone."
2914,Like people have lost their damn minds.
2915,"I know there's always been antivaxxers, but in the last 2 decades it just seems to have exploded."

2925,I had read some stuff about a third dose yielding a very strong immune response a while ago but maybe that isn't the formal report or data.

2929,Younger people are absolutely getting shredded right now.
2930,"waiting for the post cheering for the 1,8% positivity rate in the whole country also mentioning that we have mostly vaccinated with sinovac, does that suit up the subreddit hate for chinese vaccines?"

2933,"I know we're all tired of empty promises about justice being served, but I'd be blown away if DeSantis is not a central player within the Matt Gaetz criminal investigation when this is all over."
2934,I really do believe Matt Gaetz will face prosecution and I also think many other Florida Republicans will also face similar consequences for their assumed involvement.
2935,"But that's just 2015 me thinking, remembering the before time when things like pedophilia mattered."
2936,Someone need to sue his ass off.
2937,Two cafeets there.
2938,1) If you do get sick you're still a drain on a stretched health system making it not just your but everyones problem 2) you can transmit it to people who had nothing to do with the event.

2957,"&gt; “If anybody is out there trying to get around the testing requirements, that’s really something that should be dealt with severely by any university we believe,” said Todd McGee with the Orange County Health Department."
2958,I don’t think it should only be left to be handled by the university.
2959,"I definitely think the university should at minimum bar people caught doing this from campus until they can meet a much higher burden of proof that they were actually vaccinated, but this is not limited to college students, and should come with stiff penalties at the city or state level."
2960,"The Delta variant’s lack of f**ks for antibodies/herd immunity + likelihood of asymptomatic spread outcomes among even the vaccinated = hot point for developing the next, possibly worse, variant."

2971,His rationale isn't far from what some of the more aware anti-vaxxers say.
2972,ie—I had COVID once and recovered so getting infected again is not a concern and my primary care doctor told me not to get it even though the CDC advises it for people with the condition I'm citing.
2973,"&gt;	Beyond this rather simple explanation, medical surge is an extraordinarily complex topic that is difficult to comprehensively describe."
2974,Unfortunately it’s not as simple as you would think.
2975,Hospitals already have  wiggle room with the number of babies they can take care of.
2976,Each hospital has its own defined surge and depends on lots of factors.
2977,We have 80% of adults vaccinated in the Northeast by the way.

3074,"There are a number of variables at play here, but I don't think there is any clear indication that more recent variants are less lethal."
3075,"The lower mortality rates could be due to a number of factors:

* Vaccinations (especially in older people)
* Better treatments
* Younger age group getting infected
* Etc."
3076,etc.
3077,"Generally, viruses like this mutate to be less lethal because the more lethal mutations kill their host before the host can spread it further, giving a survival edge to the mutations that keep their hosts alive longer."
3078,That's not as big of a factor with Covid because most of the deaths happen after the host has mostly gone through the infectious stage.
3079,So I wouldn't depend on this virus mutating to be less lethal as happened with the 1918 flu.
3080,I think realistically we are looking at an endemic disease that we will need booster shots for as well as becoming accustomed to applying methods to diminish exponential spread when it becomes unmanageable.

3108,!
3109,"I'm ""fixated"" on discussing the topic of the post?"
3110,It was my understanding before Covid that viruses mutate into more transmissible but less dangerous variants.
3111,This asshole though is mutating into more transmissible and more deadly version.
3112,Wtf?
3113,I’m so hoping we can still get there but it probably won’t happen until most people in the world have antibodies
3114,[deleted]
3115,I'm not saying that we should lock everyone down again.
3116,Bad idea.
3117,"I'm saying that we don't have herd immunity, and that COVID is dangerous enough, and that a large number of people literally CANNOT protect themselves, and that a vaccine in you does not protect the people you infect."
3118,"Sure, the ***danger*** of the pandemic is basically over for the average vaccinated person."
3119,But not for those who can't vaccinate yet.
3120,Why is it such a hardship to wear a basic mask to protect other people?
3121,It's literally a minor inconvenience.
3122,People who starving are far more likely to eat
3123,"thanks, at least we try."

3130,I’m so fucking jealous of everyone who graduated before 2020.
3131,"I feel like the most unique time of my life and my most active, youthful years are slipping away."
3132,I’ll never get this time back and I haven’t been able to live it to the fullest.
3133,I know I sound fucking selfish.
3134,Maybe I am.
3135,But this life with restrictions coming back right now isn’t a life worth living in the long term.
3136,"And I’m not going to take my own life or anything, I’m just angry and tired and fed up."
3137,Ugh.
3138,Killing two birds with one stone.

3158,"&gt;what the endgame is

Here's the end game since everybody here is so obsessed with ""endgame"": **To make Covid become a manageable threat without restrictions."
3159,"**

The thing is, people have said this but it looks like a lot of people here just aren't hearing it or choosing to ignore it."
3160,"I don't know which, tbh."
3161,"So now, what does this ""endgame"" mean?"
3162,It means get people vaccinated to the point that hospitalizations don't overwhelm hospitals.
3163,"Clearly, \~50% vaccination is not enough."
3164,It needs to be much higher.
3165,And we know that the 99.9%+ of vaccinated people will not get hospitalized.
3166,"I recall a lot of people on this sub said ""oh the virus will mutate into something like a seasonal gold""."
3167,"Yes it probably will become that eventually, but we can get there A LOT faster if people would take the damn vaccines."
3168,"Another way to get to that endgame is an anti-viral pill that pharma companies are developing now, where you can just take it within 1 week of showing symptoms or a positive test, before the virus overwhelms the body to the point where people need to be hospitalized."
3169,"Ideally, we'd have both high vaccinations and this anti-viral pill because that would end this sooner."
3170,[removed]
3171,Spanish flu type beat
3172,Herd immunity.
3173,Doesn't matter about reported case numbers not following the herd immunity curve.
3174,They aren't following the expected curve because they are not the real case numbers.
3175,Delta is so infectious its rapidly burning through the population.
3176,Those left unvaccinated are all the younger cohorts likely to have an asymptomatic or mild case anyway.
3177,They are simply not bothering to get tested either assuming its another respiratory infection or hay fever or they know it could be covid but they don't want to have to quarantine or miss work.
3178,"Delta being dominant changes a lot of factors from spread, to typical viral load in a given space during sporadic community transmission, etc."
3179,"Furthermore, the studies’ own authors don’t consider the Delta sample size large or representative enough."

3184,Thank you for your compassion for your patients.
3185,Despite your username you seem to be a very approachable onion.
3186,Exactly!
3187,That’s what I think too but I was afrait to say it.
3188,"The thing is delta is extremely contagious and you can’t just continuously lock up and mass test millions of people at a time, it is an unsustainable strategy."
3189,Source?
3190,We probably learn a lot from facial cues at a young age.
3191,And that asshole already had it.
3192,"He’ll never admit it, but he did disappear for a couple weeks last year during the peak in Florida"
3193,In this specific case?
3194,Yes.
3195,We’ve reached a point where the data is all out there and yet there’s a subset of people who are doing the equivalent of sticking their fingers in their ears and singing “not listening lalalalala.” These people can’t be reasoned with.
3196,If they could they’d have gone and gotten their shots.
3197,And it would decimate the state economically.
3198,"It’s an overreaction and would punish a lot of people trying to do the right thing, myself included."
3199,A more realistic alternative is to require vaccines for interstate travel.
3200,When every school and workplace in the coutry requires their workers to be vaccinated.
3201,Don't want to get vaccinated when you're fully healthy and have no reason not to get it?
3202,"You don't get paid to come in and infect people, period."
3203,Pray you can find an in home job.
3204,*There are obvious medical exceptions but that's a large minority of the crowd that is unvaccinated.
3205,Tell me which part of the world eliminated Covid with masking?
3206,[deleted]
3207,Didn’t imply that.
3208,Anyone who had any symptoms would get tested.
3209,Would be lying if the second shot didn’t knock most people out for 24 hours though.
3210,"And among college seniors in the final few months of school, yeah some might not want to get the second shot on a friday"
3211,I think a big part of it is they want to see how long the effectiveness lasts before needing a booster to bring the effectiveness level back up.
3212,Pfizer would obviously like everyone getting a booster every month if they could since they have a lot of money to gain from that so they're not a trustworthy source in terms of booster timeline recommendation.
3213,The government may give in a little and just go with 6 months but we're just nearing the point where those who were able to get vaccines earliest (besides those in the trials) would be hitting 6 months.
3214,"It kills less than the flu, SO FAR."
3215,People comparing final flu deaths counts to the current death count of an ongoing pandemic are aggressively moronic.
3216,"And like you said, that doesn't even account for the schools being shut down and kids not congregating anywhere close to how they used to pre-Corona."
3217,In other news: water is wet.
3218,[deleted]
3219,You can go to any of the urgent care centers and get them done.
3220,"Can also go to Publix, Walgreens, and CVS."
3221,Lots of choices honestly.
3222,Yeah.
3223,It's called [lambda](https://www.infectioncontroltoday.com/view/lambda-variant-of-covid-19-might-be-resistant-to-vaccines).
3224,I highly recommend seeking out some of the more vocal virologists and immunologists who explain that vaccine escape is highly unlikely.
3225,Priming our immune systems is about way more than just antibodies or whether or not we can prevent you from testing positive.
3226,They’re about defanging it once your immune system comes in contact with it.
3227,"And there are only so many ways this virus could mutate, and these vaccines address those."
3228,"Honestly, if you step back from the present risks and think longer term, it’s probably more likely that the next killer virus to emerge will be something other than Covid because there are many viruses we don’t have vaccines for that are less stable and that circulate widely between humans and animals."
3229,It's not behaving like the flu because we have far less collective immunity against it than the flu.
3230,"Once enough people get vaccinated/infected, then it will calm down."
3231,We're all trying to find the guy who did this
3232,I am running out of my patience with these morons.
3233,Yeah definitely.
3234,But we aren't getting shots to those people in some countries at all yet which is a problem.
3235,The over-1% CFR we're seeing in over-50s after vaccination makes justifying a booster shot pretty easily for older people.
3236,Whereas for younger people it looks like the whole thing's over after vaccination.
3237,(Thanks.)
3238,[removed]
3239,Same.
3240,"I know two people who currently have ""break through"" Covid."
3241,One is near the end of her quarantine and just had mild symptoms.
3242,The other was just diagnosed this past weekend but also has mild symptoms.
3243,They are both healthcare workers so I can only imagine that they had a bigger viral load exposure than the average joe.
3244,This was already explained last year by our former President.
3245,"""If we stop testing right now, we’d have very few cases, if any,” Trump said during a White House event."
3246,Ron is just following Trumps advice.
3247,"Education is a legally protected right, so the school system  likely has a legal edge, but Desantis could do a lot of damage while a court case plays out, which is a problem"
3248,"That's when you will see fake vacc cards pop up in the black market lol, you really can't control everyone's lives, deal with it."
3249,Wow still exploiting your second cousin’s outlier case to appeal to people’s emotions.
3250,You really are a piece of work.
3251,The 🐭 is the real boss.
3252,it's already evolved and last year's vaccines are really effective.
3253,so it will be an annual shot or bi-annual like the flu shots?
3254,big deal?
3255,good analogy
3256,Im so sorry for you.
3257,In denmark 85% of People 15+ have had first shot.
3258,"And 72,5 of all people had the first shot."
3259,The level of misinformation and manipulation in US is insane.
3260,And then you count as unvaccinated if you do not have three(+x) vaccinations...
3261,I think two were a big enough risk for healthy young people.
3262,thanks for the info.
3263,"looked it up, https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/guillain-barre-syndrome/symptoms-causes/syc-20362793."
3264,"seems to me, a layman, if he had a mild case of covid like he says, his chances of getting this is less the me winning the lottery tonight."
3265,Well this have to wear it in many stores and on the public transit.
3266,I personally pull my mask down outside and just pull it on when needed.
3267,Oh wow I forgot about that.
3268,"Yeah it's bound to spread, even amongst vaccinated people."
3269,But i think that's all the more reason to bring more attention to hospitalizations (or lackthereof).
3270,"I myself, admittedly waiver between ""I'm vaxxed, I'm good!"""
3271,and letting the news and headlines get the best of my anxiety.
3272,"I think it needs to be communicated that you should be living life, but just a bit more cautiously with the delta variant out there."
3273,Otherwise people are gonna start getting nuts.
3274,Tell me oh logical one how immunity works and why Covid is different than the vast majority of illnesses.
3275,Our son gets headaches when he masks up for an extended period of time so if the risk isn't there he won't be wearing one.
3276,"Again, risk management 😃 not fear, so you can live your life 😃"
3277,"From November 2020 to early February 2021, I was in the same boat as you."
3278,"Just debilitatingly depressed, anxious, and pessimistic."

3283,glad to share it with the world.
3284,*Cubans*.
3285,Specifically Miami Cubans.
3286,The rest of the Latino bloc isn’t as easy to scare.
3287,I think this is underrated news because there was talk that Gamma didn’t work as well against the current vaccine as other strains did including Delta but it just wasnt as contagious and was being outcompeted.
3288,These numbers are good
3289,I haven't been following it super closely or anything but I'm really amazed at just how quickly it's spiking.
3290,The curves (at least upward trajectory) are steeper than before.
3291,And we're seeing this with less testing infrastructure than we had in place last summer &amp; fall.
3292,"The other two vaccinated members of our household have tested positive with symptoms, making the grand total 6 out of 6."
3293,"With the old math, it should have been a probability of around 0.0064%."
3294,Our Delta math is *way* off.
3295,"&gt; That's where you are wrong, it could have been stopped with a quick and decisive lockdown."
3296,The only universe where that happens is one where restrictions are instituted before Chinese New Year travel.
3297,lol I'm a propagandhi guy these days if you wanna look into what im consuming
3298,"I agree, but hospitals in the south are a completely different breed."
3299,"Look at some of the hospital staff vaccination rates in this article:

&gt;Baton Rouge General Hospital reported 53% of staff vaccinated, and said it has no plans to mandate vaccines at this time."
3300,"Once the mask mandate is lifted for hospitals, unvaccinated employees will be required to continue to wear masks."
3301,That's *in a fucking hospital*
3302,&gt;The actual vaccination rate in may be higher because of unallocated vaccinations.
3303,"In VA, 26.5% of the state's population has been vaccinated but not allocated to a specific county."
3304,Looks like most states that number is under &lt;5%

3306,"yes, they are."
3307,"Pfizer CEO was on ""In the Bubble"" last week discussing this."
3308,"they are working on specific boosters for many variants simultaneously, but according to their internal studies/data, a third booster of the original vaccine is better than a Delta booster."
3309,"Since it's from the Pfizer CEO, take the second part with a grain of salt, I guess; but they are definitely working on variant-specific ones."

3318,"If enough people in any given country or region get vaccinated, then you'll get occasional small flare-ups at worse."
3319,"&gt; Because if a vaccine evading variant comes, we'll have to go back to our horrible winter."
3320,So let's just enjoy it while we can.
3321,You're afraid of a vaccnie-proof variant so you're doing what you can to help that along?
3322,Every new infection is another chance for mutation.
3323,"I'm not syaing live in a hermitage but don't take pointless risks, and keep protecting as needed."

3355,I kinda wish trump won if that’s what it would take for them to take the damn shot
3356,Isn’t AZ a double-shot dose in itself though?
3357,I understand that the two vaccines work the same way but they are still completely different vaccines with different levels of effectiveness.
3358,I don’t think it’s so easy to compare.
3359,Just like the people who are assuming Mederna &amp; Pfizer have the same level of effectiveness b/c they work the same way... it’s not so cut &amp; dry.

3393,Either way…….

3396,"When I tell them about hospitals  running out of space they say its just 'the liberal media lies""."
3397,When I go shopping I'd estimate maybe 20% of the public wear a mask.
3398,Lots of times the unmasked will glare at us who wear them.
3399,Maybe don't try to be deceptive?
3400,My cousins 4 year old had covid last October and since complains constantly her chest hurts after she plays too hard.
3401,She’s been seen by specialists who think she now has a heart problem probably from covid.
3402,She’s FOUR.
3403,"My cousin is sending her to school next week, which is in a state where masks are a considered a big joke."
3404,I don’t want kids myself but seeing how some parents are just being so negligent about their children’s health makes me so angry.
3405,That's not how it works.
3406,"It doesn't mean you have a 50% chance of getting infected if you're vaccinated, it means your chances of getting infected are 50% lower than if you aren't vaccinated."
3407,Cutting infection rate by 50% is necessary to keep hospital capacity at reasonable levels.
3408,Did you wear seatbelts?
3409,And I bet you didn’t get in an accident that whole trip.
3410,"Guess you should stop using seatbelts and disable your airbags, since they’re useless."
3411,"Overwhelming no, you thinking that a ton of people who won’t get the vaccine are doing it because their hospital bills would be paid for is hilarious."
3412,"I bet you also think that the US healthcare system is unethical, and are pro student debt forgiveness, so you probably shouldn’t be a fan of this either."
3413,Yes which is why there were flu seasons... we having covid seasons now
3414,"&gt;Alabamians, though, left out a key step in the comeback plan."
3415,"Two out of every three Calhoun County residents have yet to roll up their sleeves for a single dose of COVID-19 vaccine, according to statistics from the Alabama Department of Public Health."
3416,Only 28 percent have completed the full series of shots.

3419,Not an emergency rushed V
3420,That's the narrative.
3421,Well done.
3422,We need a way to securely demonstrate vaccination and make it HURT not to be vaccinated.
3423,"Sorry, no grocery store for you - curbside and delivery only."
3424,No bars.
3425,No restaurants.
3426,No church.
3427,No sporting events (from NFL to peewee baseball).

3441,"There are places that aren't checking your insurance information...

Yeah, no data (of course), but enough anecdotal info for me, at least."
3442,You're not asking any questions!
3443,What's your question?
3444,What haven't I answered?
3445,You're just saying things with no substance to them.
3446,"I've literally linked you to the state health departments where they say, clearly written out, you do not need insurance, and other people in this same comment thread have verified and confirmed you do not need an ID."
3447,Do you think pharmacies are the only place a vaccine is administered?
3448,"Like I said, Oregon and Washington STATE hosted mass vaccination events."
3449,How are they going to accurately track vaccines administered to someone without an ID or insurance?
3450,You're like that guy that has a friend who knows a guy who has a cousin who works at a place that knows something.

3489,"Of course you have to ignore the deaths, long-covid, and all the HCW with PTSD."
3490,"Parents, who won’t mask, aren’t going to mask their kids unless forced to do so."
3491,Isn’t it really being spread by foreigners/illegal aliens?
3492,(For those that need it spelled out—NO.
3493,It’s not.
3494,It’s being spread by people who refuse to mask and refuse to get vaccinated.)

3551,Start a daily cardio workout routine and dedicate yourself to it for 2 weeks.

3553,Commit another 2 weeks and continue from there.
3554,"April-June 2020, I was having daily anxiety attacks about the food supply issues near me, the open possibility that my home state would have to shut down again, and that I would have to uproot my whole life again to run support for another COVID positive family member of mine that works in one of the local hospital systems."
3555,"The daily night biking routine I committed to helped me sleep easier, kept me from overthinking before I had more facts, and had me physically and mentally strong enough that by the time the vaccine arrived near my block, I felt enough in me to go volunteer and provide logistical support to my local vaccination center."
3556,Here come the lawsuits

3563,The end game is we continue living our lives with yet another virus floating around.
3564,Your flair says you are fully vaccinated which is great.
3565,Now you can just live your life with some precautions to lower the risk of catching covid.
3566,Those precautions will lessen over time.
3567,Realistically you have done the most important thing you can do which is get vaccinated.
3568,If you can help family and friends also protect themselves by them getting vaccinated you can do that to help also.
3569,We live in a world with many viruses and thanks to vaccinations they are not something we think about often.

3585,I am an Uber driver that drives Fri/Sat night (high risk of infection).
3586,"The mask mandates are almost impossible to enforce where I live, and even then I fear the loud talking and singing I frequently encounter renders them ineffective in a small confined space."
3587,I was double vaccinated in March.
3588,I am strongly considering getting a 3rd dose of Pfizer given the recent data showing waning immunity versus symptomatic infection.
3589,Should I do it?
3590,Thanks!
3591,Gonna be a lot of unemployment soon
3592,/r/Unexpectedtheymightbegiants
3593,"Yes, I'm sure they're quaking in their boots at the prospect of a mild head cold, a few days in bed at worst."
3594,Especially given all they've been made to sacrifice over the past year.
3595,It’s kind of true though.
3596,I see that I missed that the study was saying less than 50% of unvaccinated convalescent individuals had any detectable neutralization of Delta after 12 months.
3597,"That does seem significant, though my understanding is declining and disappearing neutralization is not the same as losing all immunity."
3598,"The other stuff isn't relevant to my question, though I can see how it would be if I was asking if there was evidence that vaccination could better protect the convalescent."

3600,"Florida, the 3rd world country"
3601,I wonder how off guard schools have been caught with this new surge.
3602,"As of June, It seemed the worst was behind us and a closer sense of “normalcy” was coming in late August/September."
3603,"All of a sudden, the alarm bells are ringing and I wonder if schools are prepared to change course if necessary…"
3604,The KN95/N95 respirators are very effective protection for you as well as others.
3605,You can get them for as little as $0.20 each in bulk.
3606,I voted against him.

3615,Not really anywhere near the same.
3616,"The original set of vaccines were built against the ancestral strain that was outcompeted sometime in March of 2020, before the phase 2 trials were even done."
3617,"Slap together a mRNA vaccine with Beta's spike, Delta's spike, and the ancestral Spike (Honestly, sub in d164g on the ancestral spike as the original does not exist in any meaningful way anymore) and COVID's going to have a real bad time trying to find epitopes not covered."
3618,"One endgame is that the variant evolution sort of ends/stabilises at the point ofn'spreads easily but is relatively harmless, and spread and with any severe effects attenuated with vaccination.'"
3619,Fingers crossed.
3620,"Possibly true, but how much are hospitalizations lagging cases these days?"
3621,"For instance, from mid-March through mid-April there was a smaller ""spike"" in Florida (~50% increase in cases), and it doesn't seem like hospitalization rates lagged at all; the peak of hospitalizations was just a few days after the peak in cases."
3622,"Winding back to the end of last year, there was a nearly 100% spike in cases in Florida that peaked on 1/9/2021 and it looks like hospitalizations peaked right around the same time."
3623,"Looks like this dude needs to worry about his weight, not masks."
3624,Sheesh
3625,That’s not nice to say.
3626,They’re human beings 😳

3660,"Yes, have faith."
3661,Remember last year when they were saying they didn't think we'd get any lasting immunity from a vaccine?
3662,Or when the SA variant was supposed to be able to evade the vaccine?
3663,Fauci does talk in worst case scenarios- he wants to motivate people to get vaccinated/ or for leaders to take a stronger lead on vaccination.
3664,[deleted]
3665,Are you over 65 or immunocompromised?
3666,"If not, there is no country doing this."
3667,You’re wrong and you’ve wasted valuable resources because you think you know better.
3668,Of course they are acting like everything is normal.
3669,It’s collective denial.
3670,They would rather pretend it’s fine than get a mask or get vaccinated.
3671,[removed]
3672,"Measles is the current, time-tested champion of infectiousness for humans."
3673,It's R-value is around 12–18 and herd immunity threshold is 92-94%.
3674,So some variant of COVID might end up being like that at some point.
3675,"Damn, that's cold."
3676,Florida is not some monolith that rejected vaccines.
3677,"Lots of us here got vaccinated, stayed home, still wear masks when we go to the store etc."
3678,My little just turned 2 y.o.
3679,and has never known a normal life.
3680,She cannot be vaccinated.
3681,"I'd like to think you'd have a little sympathy for all of us doing the best we can with the choices available, yet still being stuck in a mass of massless covidiots."
3682,I find it odd they don't offer raw numbers in the article.
3683,% isnt very helpful without what the number is based off of.
3684,Going from 10 to 20 is 100% but so is 100 to 200.
3685,Both are very different.
3686,Anyone have any insight?
3687,"And oddly, they wanted to take credit for the vaccine when it first came out."
3688,Nope.
3689,Places that cater to communities that have low vaxx rates are likely to not bother enforcing a vaccine mandate.
3690,Why would they?
3691,It would be bad for business.
3692,The better to eat
3693,See my other comment.
3694,"You don’t know what a control group is, but you want me to think you’re intelligent enough to know the optimal sample size?"
3695,Absolutely!
3696,Lmao!!
3697,!
3698,I worked in public schools and can confirm all of this.
3699,"Also, there are times when the teacher, who is monitoring possibly 30+ kids, doesn't noticed that Little Johnny is improperly wearing his mask."
3700,I can't tell you how many times I would also just walk into a classroom last year and see most of the kids with their masks off.
3701,"Hey, my 4 year old with an autoimmune disorder on heavy immunosuppressive treatments such as chemo drugs and steroids needs YOU to get it to protect her."
3702,"If you want to take the stance that you don’t want to get it, that’s fine, own it, but don’t make it about doing it for the betterment of others."
3703,"It doesn’t work like that, not in the U.S. where we have the supply of vaccines anyways."
3704,Small local government fighting back against big government overreach.
3705,Abbot should applaud that.
3706,They don’t actually believe the lies they tell.
3707,Just like Ted Cruz they’re Ivy League graduates.
3708,For example during the Texas grid blackout Cruz claimed it was solar and wind that went down.
3709,He damn well knows that’s a lie.
3710,But his base doesn’t know that.
3711,Anything to get people mad at democrats instead of them is a smart tactic politically.
3712,You’ll see the same thing when the individual tax cuts start expiring.
3713,Republicans made sure to keep corporate cuts permanent but individual cuts expire.
3714,It’ll be perfect to blame the Dems in charge when it starts expiring and people’s taxes go up
3715,People would still have it happen.
3716,Anecdotal but I asked my pharmacist and she said it was okay.
3717,I took Xanax before getting it rather than after.
3718,"I live in Florida, honestly, nothing has changed, everyone is acting like life is normal, it's awful."
3719,"I also work at a hospital but in a non medical role, but I see the numbers shooting up and our hospital is quite full."
3720,[deleted]
3721,That’s the exact group you want to be tested.
3722,"If the **only** people who were being tested were those that showed symptoms of Covid, you would be close to having a point."
3723,"Instead if you mandate that everyone who gets off an airplane or goes into work is tested, that’s a good randomized sample."
3724,"So, again, you’re demonstrating you don’t know wtf you’re talking about lmao."
3725,You’re right on that last sentence.
3726,"I’m not an anti-vaxxer, I’m just waiting until there’s more information, and at least full FDA approval, for this one."
3727,I don’t feel too good about taking something still in its unofficial experimental phase.
3728,"Otherwise, I probably would have been vaccinated long ago."
3729,"I’m also in NYC where they just mandated it for many indoor activities yesterday, so I’m hoping the approval, at least, comes soon."
3730,I haven't looked into that in any depth but I would guess that it has to do with there being significant functional [differences between a developing immune system and a mature one](https://i.imgur.com/Z17Waf8.png).
3731,There go his chances of being president
3732,i'm guessing it's a supply/cost issue.
3733,"once fda fully approves it, technically people could get a 3rd or a 4th shot legally, but if everyone does it, will they have enough to go around?"
3734,the vaccine is essentially scheduling one's artificial covid infection.
3735,"ideally you'd schedule it 4 weeks before you go that music festival when it's peak antibodies, so that you could enjoy weeks of maskless post-party."
3736,"Yeah, I’m not sure what OP is talking about"
3737,It’s my understanding those already shipped out in the US can’t be sent abroad.
3738,So by not authorizing boosters those doses are literally going to waste for no reason.
3739,[removed]
3740,That’s the equivalent of requiring masks at a trump rally lol this will not end well.
3741,"yep, identifying genetic material with PCR is incredibly accurate for the speed you can get results."
3742,Don't we already know this?
3743,They don't give a shit who they kill.
3744,You can also catch chicken pox twice.
3745,"My gut instinct, without researching it, is that you're unlikely to catch covid twice and unlikely to catch chicken pox twice, but at the moment there's so much covid going around (compared to most people's lifetime exposure to chicken pox) that more second-infections are happening than with chicken pox."
3746,What states have this?
3747,Definitely.
3748,"I’ve always struggled with being too lax sometimes, but… this is one I’m doing my best to hold my ground on."
3749,"And like you said, hopefully, it’s a motivator for people to actually get vaccinated, especially when they’ll miss out on important things otherwise."
3750,"I think if (and when) there's ever a variant of concern comes out of FL, we should name it DeSantis Variant."
3751,Always Sunny.
3752,"The symptoms of ""long covid"" seem to mirror that of my depression and anxiety episodes."
3753,I would be depressed too if I caught covid.
3754,Yes.
3755,I read the article.
3756,Did you read the article?
3757,"If it wasn't for the vaccine, those people would be dead."
3758,It’s more than a weird feedback loop.
3759,Not too long ago headlines and prime time news used to read like this and people accepted it.
3760,https://foreignpolicy.com/2020/09/03/trumps-vaccine-cant-be-trusted/
3761,4-fold reduction in neutralization from unvaccinated individuals with a prior infection vs 3-fold reduction in neutralization titers from vaccinated individuals doesn't seem like a big difference.
3762,"Is there evidence of a significant difference in protection against infection, symptoms, or severe disease?"
3763,I'm not sure what simultaneous infection has to do with immunity from a prior infection.
3764,Wouldn't the infection with the second strain happen before immunity develops?
3765,Where did you read that masks suddenly don't work against the delta variant?
3766,I hope this doesn't make me sound like an asshole because I don't mean for it to at all.
3767,I think it's unfair for parents / parents with immunocompromised children to expect vaccinated people to put their lives on pause for the unforeseen future.
3768,"I'm truly sorry for people in that situation, but like Dr. Fauci and co always say, you have to take a rational risk assessment."

3775,"It felt like mini covid that went away in a couple of days compared to the weeks / months my symptoms lasted when I was sick (March 2020)

I can smell better after being vaccinated."
3776,TIL water is wet.
3777,The theories I’ve read as to why it won’t go that direction seem to conclude that the long asymptomatic contagious period puts almost no selective pressure on severity of disease.
3778,Basically It kills people slowly so no reason to ditch that element from an evolution perspective.
3779,It is just a waiting game at this point.
3780,"The MA study has plenty of facts, exactly as I stated."
3781,You will do anything and reach for any straw to deny them.
3782,"I don't understand it, but that is how things are now."
3783,Why some people still trust the government and MSM is a complete mystery to me.
3784,They have consistently lied to us for years now.
3785,It is necessary to really research to find anything approaching the truth.
3786,Even the Governor Whitmer kidnapping turns out to be an FBI op.
3787,WTF!
3788,12 of 18 suspects are FBI informants.
3789,Notice how silent the media is about this.
3790,It was an FBI op to freak everybody out about Trump.
3791,"Caitlin Johnstone, as usual, says it nicely:

\\[https://caitlinjohnstone.com/2021/08/04/after-russiagate-why-wouldnt-people-be-skeptical-about-covid/](https://caitlinjohnstone.com/2021/08/04/after-russiagate-why-wouldnt-people-be-skeptical-about-covid/)"
3792,Even more depressing is to see it in a state breakdown where all the surrounding towns are doing okay with vaccination and your town is a bunch of anti-vaxxers.
3793,Always has been.
3794,hopefully this increases the vaccination numbers
3795,Children can still spread it to adults.
3796,In the US this is all a political game where we have states with lower than 50% vaccination rates
3797,"Serious question, did you honestly not think your posts would end up in just a ton of downvotes?"
3798,Were you seeking attention?
3799,You are admitting to doing something which isn't even recommended and isn't even allowed.
3800,The Biden admin has said time and time again if there is a need for boosters it would be the most vulnerable crowd.
3801,Clearly you don’t remember the Tellula Lake incident of 1991.
3802,I was there.
3803,"I can still hear the screams of, “Read my lips; no new taxes.”"
3804,It's weird how that disconnect seems to exist.
3805,"Here in NC when it was announced that if you're vaccinated you can stop wearing a mask, but if you're not please keep wearing it."
3806,"Everyone, **EVERYONE** knew that the unvaccinated people were going to take advantage of that."
3807,Because anti-maskers are also anti-vaxxers.
3808,"Oh yeah but didn't you say close to the beginning of this thread :

&gt;Very important, **4.4% of those that developed symptoms**, and since so few children get symptomatic COVID, you are at a very, very low chance to even develop this."
3809,?
3810,What do you get out of lying and minimizing the crisis bro?
3811,Stop that!
3812,Highly vaccinated populations through which the virus is still spreading favor the development and spread of vaccine resistant variants.
3813,So that needs to be weighed in too.
3814,"I had J&amp;J as well, asking our on site physician, but I'm assuming the guidance would be to get the booster and the CPT would be for second dose."
3815,"I'm neither a medical practictioner nor a biller, though"
3816,I'm wondering if this will remain true with the Delta variant
3817,He hates it so much he keeps commenting here on this thread.
3818,Death is not the only bad outcome.
3819,I am so tired of repeating this.
3820,Long COVID still happens in about 20% of the vaccinated.
3821,Then there’s all the organ damage and blood clotting problems.
3822,Why can’t we do both?
3823,Develop boosters and ramp up vaccine donations to other nations.
3824,This sounds pretty useless with no real benefit
3825,I’ll give you a hint: He ran this country for four years.
3826,&gt; There's been tens of thousands of different mRNA in your body every day of your life.
3827,This is what I try to tell them.
3828,Every orifice of your body has millions of bacteria and viruses with different mRNA and DNA.
3829,"When you get an infection, that gets inside you too."
3830,Our bodies know how to deal with random bits of RNA and DNA when we fight infection.
3831,It gets chewed up in our normal processes all the time.
3832,The only problem is when we can't fight the organisms that bring it.
3833,"Then we might need help with antibiotics to kill the bacteria, anti virals to kill viruses or vaccines to teach our immune system to kill them."
3834,"At the end of all that we clean up the mess of proteins, lipids, RNA and DNA, etc..that is left behind from the death of the invaders."
3835,No it doesn’t.
3836,7/31 and 8/1 were the weekend.
3837,"If you’ve paid attention to case, hospital, and mortality numbers they always dip on the weekends since the very beginning."
3838,What date are the schools starting?
3839,Is it August 16th most places in the US?
3840,Not sure why you’re getting downvoted.
3841,"I’m convinced many parents don’t want to be parents and prefer outsourcing the upbringing of their kids to schools, after school programs and activities so the parents never really have to parent."
3842,Your first responsibility as a parent is to keep your kids safe.
3843,Do what you feel is the responsible thing during an unknown mutation of a long running pandemic.
3844,Certain states won’t require masks and won’t find virtual learning so all choices are miserable.

3849,Expecting what?
3850,Then to realize they are wrong and not be dicks?
3851,I wouldn’t say fuck Reddit because I responded to a jerk and they were a jerk.
3852,There are shitty things on here but that is on any platform with a large community.

3854,https://www.goodrx.com/blog/covid-19-vaccine-drug-interactions/
3855,"If asymptomatic, why were they tested?"
3856,Just curious how they found out.
3857,This.
3858,"And we will see true treatment options for it that go beyond ""keep the body alive until it can defeat the virus""

It just takes time."
3859,"By now, I'm at the point where i say that once kids can be safely vaccinated, it's up to everyone on it's own what he wants to do or not."
3860,This can't go on forever.
3861,"Even crazier when you goto covidactnow.com and put Louisiana versus a high vaccination state like VT, MD, CT, or MA."
3862,Puts it into context.
3863,"That site allows you to compare States, Counties, and Metro areas on a graph."
3864,Just go down to trends and change the location.
3865,Louisana is a rocket ship.
3866,There’s more than one rural county in Massachusetts.
3867,This chart is weird.
3868,"But it needs to be the kind without a filter, because that type will still expose others nearby to your cooties when you breathe out."
3869,"Delta is as contagious as chickenpox, which you might be too young to remember because the vaccine has been out for a long time, but it's SUPER contagious."
3870,"I would invert that, with mypillow and maybe OG companies backing Trump and most others seeing Trump as a liability."
3871,Jeff Zucker of CNN thought Trump was all dandy till CNN got pipe bombs in 2018
3872,Do you think having all schools come back won't increase the cases?
3873,"In the south, I know of one college out of like 5 states that are requiring vaccinations, and my state personally won't even allow masks."
3874,I feel we are just getting atarted here.
3875,I was thinking about this and it would be the group of people who actively tried not to educate people on evolution not understanding viral evolution.
3876,/Sigh
3877,Probably referring to giving paid time off to employees to get the jab.
3878,&gt;Florida hospitals are struggling to get oxygen due to a rise in Covid-19 cases attributable to the delta variant and Florida Gov.
3879,Ron DeSantis’s decision not to declare another state of emergency.
3880,"&gt;A shortage of drivers who are qualified to transport oxygen, as well as restrictions around how long truck drivers can be on the road—which went back into effect following the expiration of the public health emergency in the state—means that the supply isn’t getting to the hospitals that need it most."
3881,Because the Orange dingus kept saying it was a hoax and that his worshippers don’t want to take a vaccine that is loosely associated with Democrats?
3882,Yeah this gets me every time.
3883,The RT PCR is like 98% accurate or some shit.
3884,I listened to a couple podcasts recently about how religiosity is fading in the US but Americans are turning their religious fervor to politics.
3885,It’s a theory but it sounds plausible.
3886,I said last year that once this turned into a political thing instead of a health thing the battle was lost and I was correct.
3887,"Hello, can anyone tell me why you can catch covid twice, but not other viruses like chicken pox?"
3888,I’ve been trying to Google it but I can’t find any information.
3889,Thank you in advance
3890,'very unlikely to die' is the key take away from whats going on in israel and the UK
3891,That sounds more like pre symptomatic rather than asymptomatic.

3900,We set this chain of events in motion ourselves (people)...
3901,The virus was just doing what it does being given the right environment.
3902,Our leadership and citizens that didn't do their part to stop it fucked up and now everyone has to witness the consequences...

3904,"Early September they'll switch to ""We can't trust the FDA!"""
3905,[removed]
3906,There is a lot of research indicating that vaccinated people still transmit the delta variant very effectively.
3907,However the vaccines do appear to protect well against severe symptoms.

3919,Do we really think a few more Americans getting a vaccine will change anything?
3920,"Dude, no you wouldn’t do it 1000 more times."
3921,That’d be like 2000 days or 5+ years with 100 fever and a sore arm lol…

3927,Nope.
3928,See every school shooting that ever occurred.
3929,Simply not true.
3930,It absolutely caused surges in some areas... Not as widespread as some were thinking though.
3931,"I sometimes drive with my mask on in my car, because I am going from errand to errand and it’s easier to just leave it on rather than fuss with it."
3932,"Plus, I like observing good mask hygiene in general."
3933,Taking it off and putting it back on when I haven’t had a chance to properly wash my hands is gross.

3974,But I don't believe it was caused by a vaccine.
3975,Feel free to prove me wrong
3976,I agree.
3977,And in no way am I insinuating that the double-dose Pfizer is less effective than J&amp;J / any other vaccine.

3982,A lot of those places never took Covid seriously so people weren’t getting tested even with symptoms… nor did the state care to support  expansion of it.

4004,We’re gonna keep her home and homeschool until she can be vaccinated.
4005,I mean I hear you but the only thing in history that has ever totally eradicated a disease outbreak other than a vaccinations is quarantines.
4006,As long as your plague rat statesmen are allowed to travel elsewhere it will continue to spread out of control.

4008,"To piggyback on your comment, I want to let parents know about this youtuber who has done quite a bit of testing on masks and has suggestions for kids masks:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE5Uo3F2TdU

After watching a few of his videos, I picked up some KF94 Bluna brand face masks that I find to be reasonably comfortable and I can wear them for hours without getting too annoyed."
4009,He recommends several brands and has suggestions for different face sizes.
4010,"Unlike early on, high-quality masks: N95, KN95, KF94, FFP2 , etc."
4011,are now available and give decent protection to the wearer.
4012,"Also, /r/Masks4All is a good resource."

4033,No thanks.
4034,DeSantis: Let's try for 50 tomorrow!
4035,Why would they?
4036,1 shot of JJ was sufficient to fulfill the criteria for being approved and so that is what they did.
4037,And it gives the JJ vaccine a unique marketing advantage.
4038,"Also they probably anticipated the same problem that AZ had with their vaccine - with a vector vaccine you create some immunity against the vector, so the 2nd shot becomes less efficacious."
4039,Most likely 1 shot of AZ or the mRNA vaccines would also have been approved.
4040,They just never sought apprpoval for 1 shot so there is no trial data.
4041,But from the real world data we have now one can infer that efficacy of 1 shot of those is in the same area or higher as 1 shot of JJ.
4042,And keep in mind the efficacy for 2 shots is way higher than was ever needed for approval.
4043,"&amp;#x200B;

This gives a comparison of 1 shot of the mentioned vaccines and has a number of studies listed at the bottom with real world data."
4044,This actually shows even higher efficacy for 1 shot of mRNA vaccines and AZ than for 1 shot of JJ.

* [greater feeling of safety in the population =&gt; less wearing of masks, social distancing, etc] AND 
* [extremely high vaccination rate =&gt; higher number of asymptomatic and mildly symptomatic (among the vaccinated)] AND
* [ higher number of asymptomatic and mildly symptomatic =&gt; higher viral R0 in the population (regardless of strain)] AND 
* [higher higher density of people hanging out at pubs, etc =&gt; higher viral R0 in the population] AND 
* [less wearing of masks, social distancing, etc =&gt; higher viral R0 in the population] AND THEREFORE: 
* [extremely high vaccination rate =&gt; higher viral R0 in the population]

This logic does not consider the apparently open question of whether the vaccinated have a lower viral load that the unvaccinated."
4070,"Also, for purposes of this logic, I include anyone who believes they have COVID antibodies (e.g."
4071,"previously tested positive for COVID) in the ""vaccinated"" group as they will behave the same way and are assumed to have the same likelihood of becoming infected and passing on an infection to others."

4100,*
4101,The US has one of the highest rates of vaccinations in the world.
4102,Have fun with that...not going to really save you
4103,"I will do it, thanks."
4104,[removed]
4105,Up to age 17-19 depending on the state.
4106,"Maybe I didn't get the full experience, but when I had Covid back in December, my sense of taste was *distorted*."
4107,"It wasn't completely gone, but everything tasted awful."
4108,"Thankfully, it only lasted a couple of days."
4109,"That was actually my only symptom, which prompted me to get tested and isolate at home."
4110,I think youre just someone who cant accept reality mate.
4111,The SAGE report said that but that was not something that would happen in the _near future_.
4112,"Meanwhile, its likely that in the short term this virus will evade vaccines very soon."
4113,"Also, just because we've lived without mitigations with previous viruses, doesnt mean we can with Covid."
4114,Thats stupid logic.
4115,Youre not very bright.
4116,first make a photocopy of it so you have a copy (not on phone).
4117,lol the military jabs you so many times.
4118,They are good at this.
4119,Check out the list if you join the Army https://usarmybasic.com/about-the-army/army-shots
4120,"Well fair enough if I sound alarmist, but I am also trying to outright set aside notions like ""the cases here aren't even that high"" when they're higher than your last summer surge, and projected to go higher than in January."
4121,"I don't know what anyone is supposed to do to solve this, however, I'm sure going around saying things are much better than they are isn't helping."
4122,"The Bay Area is one of the most high vaccinated areas in America, it is experiencing an incredibly bad and worsening outbreak."
4123,What are people supposed to do?
4124,Acknowledge that.
4125,Not pretend it's not true because of fatigue.
4126,Start asking others to do the same.
4127,"We have a qr code app in Europe, but it's timestamped so you can't take a screenshot."
4128,Everywhere I went allowed photos of your card on your phone
4129,"Oh Milo... Man, y'all are just pinging all my favorite bands."
4130,They kinda fucked up protesting the lockdown though
4131,Yesss ima have to put my vaccine card in my car
4132,Im fairly certain he’ll end up being the Republican nominee.
4133,And you thought third wave ska was bad
4134,we do not have enough.
4135,Yeah I didn't say that graham was was the one who said it.
4136,I said he was in the front row of the rally where Trump started calling it a hoax
4137,And he is ignoring lost time when a soldier gets COVID and spreads it to several other soldiers.
4138,"&gt; You can still contract and pass the virus after taking the vacci

At a much much lower rate

&gt;be kind to each other and live in peace

Unnecessarily spreading diseases to other people is kind?"
4139,It's peaceful?
4140,Cut the fake kindness.
4141,"true kindness is not killing other people, not saying nice words"
4142,Because it is
4143,[removed]
4144,Almost as much as having a baby to save a marriage
4145,I also had to get the anthrax vaccine and boosters for the remainder of my time in.
4146,"When they say they are ""preparing"" that just means the soldiers are already in line for the jab."
4147,Hurry up and wait and all that.
4148,"If you look at countries such as India that got hit hard by Delta, it seems to have spiked quickly."
4149,We’re all praying that this is a short term setback.
4150,Yup.
4151,"Some people just don't realise that ""You're a kid, you'll be fine."
4152,"It's just a cold"" is soooo far from the truth"
4153,The places I went accepted a picture with your photo ID on hand to confirm it
4154,"100k &gt; 2

Are you new to math?"
4155,This is my hope.
4156,Clearly college material.
4157,"Idk if it's just me, but your wording/tone sounds a bit alarmist."
4158,"Yeah, COVID is still here (as in the Bay Area) and it sucks having to mask up again, but I'm fully vaxxed, already had COVID, and I'm not hanging out in places where I'm likely to catch it (bars, house parties, night clubs, prisons, hospitals, etc)."
4159,"I'm happy to still wear masks in public places, but I'm going to trust the data that shows that 99% of people suffering from COVID are unvaccinated, and breakthrough infections are relatively rare, and pose way less risk than otherwise."
4160,WTF else am I supposed to be doing?
4161,Have to nitpick.
4162,Covid outbreaks can occur among the vaccinated too.
4163,Take Israel for instance.
4164,[removed]
4165,"Omg, you so silly!!!"
4166,🤭😁
4167,"Thanks for bringing this up, I'm into hot sauces lately and I am in the hunt for my fav sauce."
4168,"At the moment I am liking Los Calientes from Hot Ones but price for qty you get is not worth it much, a little  expensive."
4169,"Will give Dexter's variety pack a try, just ordered on Amazon."
4170,Sometimes I FMB when my IBS flairs up.
4171,It makes me feel RFG and I orgasm from MMP
4172,Will a picture of my vaccine card be good enough?
4173,I don’t want to bring my card because I’m worried I’ll lose it and the vaccine website doesn’t seem to have my vaccination record.
4174,[removed]
4175,I agree.
4176,"But Some may be doing it for being ""cool"" you know."
4177,"Like the kid using the fake id to get booze is somehow usually considered ""cool"" instead of a criminal."
4178,Teen's minds work differently.
4179,Can we call it Delta Minus since it's probably going to subtract from our sanity in the coming months?
4180,"I was speaking to an executive at a hospital and he said that they can’t recruit nurses to come work at the icu or hospital, even with huge sign on bonuses and extremely competitive pay."
4181,These are precisely my feelings.
4182,"He opens his statement on medical history, and has a platform and ability to tell people to speak with their own doctors, if they are concerned."
4183,....
4184,"But, he doesn't."
4185,He goes into the anti-vax bullshit bingo that really helps no one at all.
4186,That paper was about microRNA NOT mRNA.
4187,"Was just checking out the world-o-meter site and noticed there was about 5.5 million active cases and around 11,900 serious/critical in the USA."
4188,Assuming the latter means hospitalizations?
4189,"If so, only .22% of people sick with Covid are in ending up in the hospital."
4190,If these are all mostly unvaccinated it would seem that 99.78% of people are doing ok without the vaccine?
4191,Thoughts?
4192,Would be good to see the number from the height of the last wave.
4193,Of course these numbers are likely unresolved or old.
4194,lol
4195,"If you support this, congratulations, you are racist!"
4196,"They can't really ""ensure there are leftovers"", since it's purely a number of doses per flask that has to match a number of people coming in..."
4197,School starts in a week or two.
4198,Makes no sense though.
4199,"If the other band members are vaccinated, why would he be ""unsafe"" to be around?"
4200,You can still contract and pass the virus after taking the vaccine so I'm failing to understand the exclusivity of these lists and desire to label citizens as compliant and non-compliant.
4201,Do what is right for you and pay everyone else no mind.
4202,Then we can all be kind to each other and live in peace.
4203,It happened to me when I got my vaccines for kindergarten.
4204,George Bush Senior broke into the doctor's office and sucker punched me right in the jaw.
4205,The doctor tried to fight him off but it was too late.
4206,He ended up escaping in a flurry of eagles that carried him off just as fast as he appeared.
4207,"""Let's go out for some food""

Tricks the passenger."
4208,Next the car drifts into the vaccination center.
4209,"""I'll have my 20$ please"""
4210,MicroRNA is not mRNA
4211,Religious views are no barrier to bigotry.

4214,"Damn, I had no idea he was involved in that."
4215,I love that shit.
4216,You missed a couple zeros
4217,[removed]
4218,How did Florida get this bad?
4219,It’s not even the lowest vaccination state.
4220,Is the vaccination rate overstated?
4221,I am fully vaccinated since April and am currently on day 4 of my breakthrough infection.
4222,"Unfortunately my wife is positive, my 19yo tested positive and they are both fully vaccinated as well."
4223,The only explanation we can think of is that the Delta variant is far far more contagious vaxxed or not.
4224,I ran out of fucks to give.
4225,Anyone who refuses to get the vaccine can die off for all I care.
4226,"My ""greater good"" was supporting local businesses, going out, socializing at bars, the gym, and restaurants pre-vaccine while following all local mandates."
4227,"Many people stayed in, didn't do anything and pat themselves on the back for it."
4228,Just make some friends with trees and they tell you stuff about the universe
4229,Open for...
4230,*business?
4231,"* As in, making money?"
4232,"Jeez, only in America."
4233,"I do empathise with people in his position, a doctor has told him the side effects could be worse than the disease given his history."
4234,"**However,** instead of going on to say words to the effect of *""speak to your doctor""*, he releases a diatribe of anti-vaxxer bingo that makes me feel like his position is one more of choice than based on medical grounds."
4235,oooooooh shit that was good
4236,[Science](https://i.giphy.com/media/QC7UQbxq89MnL9r6AN/giphy.webp)
4237,"Same here, fuck em."
4238,Waiting for my second shot.
4239,I’m also relieved the baby will likely get the antibodies and be protected too.
4240,I don't think they'd call it Delta by then.
4241,Omega XXXL maybe.
4242,So much winning
4243,Or the president issues a waiver to mandate an EUA vaccine.
4244,"That's always an option, it hasn't been taken because of politics and the hope that soft pressure would get numbers high enough."
4245,I watch House...so I'm going to have to assume the drummer is lying.
4246,"And then 45 minutes from now we'll find out that every time he drums, he inhales dust from the cracks in his drumsticks, and the drumsticks are made of wood from very rare South American trees, and that dust has been building up in his spinal column for the last twenty years, and it just so happens that it mimics the symptoms of GBS."
4247,"So really, they're saving his life by kicking him out of the band."
4248,"Lions &amp; tigers, have they tested the bears...but seriously folks now might be a bad time to keep pangolins in domestic zoos, I know slaughtering pangolins is bad optics but gotta crack a few eggs y'know"
4249,anecdotal but i was fully vaxxed with moderna by mid april and just got over covid
4250,Or just check the student’s info against state vaccination databases.
4251,Assuming even more.
4252,That's crazy.
4253,"As they can simply run the kids cards against state vaccination databases, they should be checking all of them, no need for a random audit."
4254,"NANOMACHINES, SON!"
4255,And it's easy on the pooper.
4256,"they also tour internationally, something they would have to stop doing if they weren't all vaccinated."
4257,"That's not an apt comparison at all, the gay couple could've had a normal cake, discrimination laws apply to denying overall service, not denying a service that you don't actually offer."
4258,Oh yeah.
4259,"I’m sorry if this came off as concern trolling, because this is actually a thing I’m struggling with."
4260,"My coworkers are fearful because the concept that all pandemics end one way or another is beyond their understanding, so all they can see is government overreach."
4261,"For the most part, these are NOT Trump people (I don’t talk to the ones who are, lol)."
4262,"I worry about my work friend with diabetes who is on the fence… his doctor almost convinced him, but now things he’s hearing are swaying him the other way."
4263,"Another work friend who “hasn’t had the time” to get the vaccine but has no problem wearing a mask, and was really nervous he got exposed the other day (unvaxxed dude was coughing and had his nose sticking out)."
4264,"I’m very concerned about mask use as PPE for the people who would benefit, given theres no longer an N95 shortage, as well as a well as the same few talking points that seemed to be emphasized by major news outlets on both sides."
4265,"A lot of people I know don’t actively seek this stuff out but find news that confirms their thoughts, not knowing who the people spouting this shit even are."
4266,"And as someone who was raised to have faith both the government and medical professionals, I don’t know how to relay the message to people who didn’t have that experience."
4267,"That latest countrywide sero survey in India came back with almost 70% of the entire population testing positive, and some areas hitting 80%."
4268,Their delta variant is incredibly contagious compared to earlier forms of the virus.
4269,They took our jaaaaaabs!
4270,I'm gonna be honest and say I didn't understand that last sentence of his but I don't think it's my fault.
4271,As long as he called No Homeo
4272,"Nah, it's extremely common."
4273,"Virtually every school district in the country mandates a variety of vaccinations before kids attend school, the government mandates certain vaccines before travel to certain places."
4274,This isn't new or controversial.
4275,This is so wrong on so many levels.
4276,Sigh.
4277,"People, get the damn vaccine."
4278,"Shucks, I'm all out of fucks to give."
4279,Positivity rate is COMPLETELY USELESS.
4280,I’ve said this before.
4281,Most of the people that get tested are front line workers who are more exposed anyway as part of a job requirement.
4282,Most ordinary people don’t get tested unless they’re sick.
4283,People mildly sick or asymptomatic don’t get tested.
4284,The results have no baseline because the number tested varies daily.
4285,The only way it would work is if there were a set number of tests randomly administerered.
4286,This post appears to be about vaccines.

4312,I'll take whatever I can get that offers protection from covid.
4313,I'm pretty sure they're working on many different things at once right now.

4328,I thought most states (or some kind of subdivision thereof) were tracking information in order to track potential side effects.
4329,"Like, no one's going to remember which lot number of Moderna they got, but the state tracks who got shots from which lot and if a bunch of people from the same lot have side effects, they'll report it to the CDC and try to contact other people who got shots from that batch."

4392,"Firstly, it doesnt enforce quarantine."
4393,"Secondly, it had been rendered useless since they adjusted it so you will only get pinged if you literally sit on someone with the virus and both of you have the app, which is unlikely since most people have deleted the piece of crap anyway."
4394,I dont know why people are reluctant to accept the virus has passed in the UK for now?
4395,"It's literally over, until Autumm when vaccine efficacy combined with results of no restrictions could change things, but even that is doubtful."
4396,You know they have the vaccine app.
4397,Can't be faked.

4428,Meh.
4429,Can't it just be herd immunity?
4430,Would that be so unexpected?
4431,Wouldn't be surprised if they later discovered that it was a spurious association caused by asymptomatic COVID infection at a similar time to when they were vaccinated

4433,IKR?
4434,LOL
4435,"I mean, they're already pumping enlisted men full of other vaccines...how is this any different?"
4436,It's not all that medically complicated.
4437,"No cases of GBS have been associated with the mRNA vaccine, and every infection with a virus is a potential trigger for GBS."
4438,That's the whole reason virus-based vaccines can cause it.
4439,"Because the body's immune reaction to having a virus in it, even an inactivated one (like in the J&amp;J) can, in rare circumstances, cause GBS."

4497,Don’t feel an ounce bad for the unvaccinated
4498,I think the mutation talking point in regards to the US is kinda dumb to be perfectly honest.

4501,How is Florida with vaccination for this to be happening ?
4502,College taught me that there are ignorant assholes at every level.
4503,"Staff, admin, students, etc."
4504,Previously being infected doesn’t seem to confer as much immunity as the vaccines.
4505,1.
4506,Antibody dependent Enhancement is term coopted by bullshit peddlers to spread fear.
4507,There is no data suggesting it is relevant to current coronavirus pandemic.
4508,"If it was, we would see much worse efficacy against hospitalization / death."
4509,"If you seriously believe otherwise, please share your source."
4510,2.
4511,"Ok, let's assume 70% of the US is vaccinated, which gives them 70% less infections (which is more than data suggests)."
4512,"Let's assume that 20% of US was already infected (more than actual data, but somewhat realistic, given how much is likely underreported), which gives them again 70% less infections (I haven't heard any number on this, but most likely it should be worse than vaccine efficacy)."
4513,Let's assume that none of the people already infected got vaccinated (which definitely not true).
4514,"This leads us to 90% of US having 70% less infections, or modifier to R_0 of 1 - 0.9*0.7 = 0.37."
4515,"This means, that Delta variant with R_0 estimated at 5-9, would have an effective R = 1.85 - 3.33."

4551,Know what's even more frustrating?
4552,"To attend and work at a university in Tampa that flat out said a few weeks ago that we need to up our vaccines (the medical school/ public health college who does covid research and analysis)...and that same university turning around and saying ""everything back to normal for the fall"" no vaccine or mask mandates for staff, faculty, or students."
4553,All because of DeSantis.
4554,It's so fucked up.
4555,Well obviously wearing masks will just make matters worse /s
4556,Well thankfully he should be fine from the numbers I’ve found from the Wall Street Journal it looks like about 4 out of 1000 kids that test positive will need hospitalization.
4557,And considering most kids who get it don’t get tested because they were asymptomatic severe cases in children are pretty rare.
4558,My cousin's toddler was in ICU for 3 weeks due to covid...
4559,If that's true there's sure a lot more than two 😅😭
4560,"I think people (read: idiots) will just say it is rushed and use that as a means to discount the thousands upon thousands of actual scientists and doctors who did the real research (not just confirmation bias ""research"" on social media)."
4561,I personally know several people who have worked on the clinical trials for some of the vaccines.
4562,"The reasons the vaccines came out so quickly are the following:

1."
4563,Companies and the government threw a crapload of money at the problem.
4564,2.
4565,"Employees worked 80+ hour weeks, 7 days a week, for months."
4566,3.
4567,The FDA prioritized reviewing the data to minimize delays in the approval process.
4568,That's it.
4569,That's all the reasons why the vaccine came out so fast.
4570,People who think the vaccine would somehow be safer if it took twice as long to come out are idiots.
4571,The same amount of work was done on the vaccine as any other drug and many people sacrificed months of their lives to do all the work in record time.
4572,Do I get some people being hesitant about taking a drug that only has EUA?
4573,Sure.
4574,But I've also never met anyone who is actually intelligent enough to articulate why when you press them.
4575,"So, yeah, it'll be interesting to see the ""rushed"" excuse continue once there is full approval."
4576,What do we want?
4577,Covid to be over.
4578,What are we doing to stop it?
4579,Not a damn thing!
4580,You should go to droplet school and give a lecture.
4581,This.
4582,How has the business press not looked at the cost of the Florida economy due to their Governor’s response.
4583,Got a kid who is just the right age for Disney and the other theme parks.
4584,"When this is over, we are booking for the California parks."
4585,I guess we'll see.
4586,I don't imagine the tolerance level will be high for this.
4587,"While this shot has been a political shitshow, COVID can disrupt combat effectiveness like any other transmissible virus."
4588,"So there isn't really room for a dissenting opinion on this, especially when it's not medical."
4589,"If we are lucky, that approval comes through sometime near labor day."
4590,"Idk where you're from, but in the US context when will this happen?"
4591,"I feel like even with the decently effective vaccines against delta, we'd need a nationally coordinated period of time where we reintroduced restrictions to get numbers super low, but that won't happen."
4592,Like sure some parts of the country can reintroduce restrictions and get cases lower but it'll be kicking around somewhere and it seems like cases will go up again when everythings 'back to normal' and there's really no end in sight.
4593,Ugh.
4594,If you are both vaccinated you are more likely to die in a car accident on the way than covid.
4595,Paywall - can someone summarize?
4596,The US has already donated 110 million doses to other countries.
4597,We’re donating 500 million more.
4598,We’ve done our part.
4599,"If there’s evidence on waning immunity, however, we can’t turn our back on our own citizens."
4600,Ask your doctor not reddit
4601,Health first.
4602,When they get vaxed(which will be soon ffs) then they can move on with life.
4603,Hard to do that from the grave or their disabled body.
4604,Same deal with me.
4605,My 13 year old is vaccinated but my 10 year old is awaiting approval this fall.
4606,I completely understand that children are low risk but spending 7 hours in a room with 24 other unvaccinated individuals just seems like a bad idea.
4607,Droplets are at least 5x larger than aerosols so that’s a big deal
4608,"At this point I’m not sure what us vaxxers can can I’ve talked to anti vaxxers none of them with any underlying health concerns, ( unless you consider being confidently ignorant on the subject COVID, vaccines, and common sense )
I talked to a friend yesterday anti vax health nut ass hat."
4609,They’re mind is made up the just won’t get it.
4610,"Insert dip shit reasons:
I’ve just never been vaccinated
(Lies you went to grade school school) 
I just don’t put non organic substances in my body 
(Idiot smokes cigarettes &amp; eats fast food) 
You don’t know you’re not a scientist
(You have no medical background &amp; failed biology) 
The governments bad the test on people I don’t trust them 
(Okay the Tuskegee experiments happened but you’re not not even African American &amp; what the fuck does that have to do with this situation?)"
4611,"Tell me why covids mutating if it’s real
( because you dumb shits keep spreading it more and more that’s how mutations work spreading to different hosts) 

Literally didn’t even bother reading the articles I sent perfectly happy with living his life as he is correct, he’s fine with being willfully ignorant."
4612,"It’s sad that someone feels as if they have no control over there own life so they take (this) hill to die on 

Or change there tune when someone close to them gets it or they do, and if I’m being honest I no longer have sympathy for any anti vaxxer, while I’m not rooting for anyone to get COVID I won’t show a shed out sympathy for anyone who was able to get the vaccine chose not to get it, ended up with COVID as a result or gave it to a family member because of you’re stupid choices straight up that goes for friends family and anyone else who holds that stupid opinion."
4613,"These people don’t care for logic they just want to have control over there life
-_- which normally isn’t a bad thing but when you’re selfish choices effects others you can just fuck right off."
4614,Sorry for the rant.
4615,"To address point by point:

I concede that the odds of getting a severe case as a vaccinated person are low."
4616,That's the point of getting the vaccine.
4617,"The point I was trying to make was that we wanted to prevent the creation of additional variants, because those variants affect us as well."
4618,It'd be kind of nasty to think yourself safe and then catch a severe case.
4619,Just because the odds are low doesn't mean it doesn't happen.
4620,"I mean, think about skin cancer."
4621,"Yeah, people go play in the sun, but most people put on sunscreen, right, to reduce the risk?"
4622,"In order to reduce the risk, vaccinated people need to make sure they follow the guidelines set out."
4623,That means protecting the unvaccinated people to some extent.
4624,"As for ""most people don't have immunocompromised children""... 

[https://www.verywellhealth.com/shingles-in-children-2634715](https://www.verywellhealth.com/shingles-in-children-2634715)

&gt;A 2007 survey in the United States estimated “prevalence rates for diagnosed \[primary immunodeficiency\] as 1 in 2,000 for children, 1 in 1,200 for all persons, and **1 in 600 households**.” Other surveys suggest that the prevalence rates might be even higher."
4625,"&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;While there don’t seem to be any complete statistics on the prevalence of secondary immunodeficiencies, they would include:  
&gt;  
&gt;About 10,000 children and teens living with HIV  
Just over 15,700 children and teens who are diagnosed with cancer each year, many of whom are treated with chemotherapy  
Almost 200,000 children and teens with diabetes mellitus  
About 1,000 children who are born in the United States each year with sickle cell disease  
Also, children with many other conditions are at increased risk of infections, including those with lupus, cystic fibrosis, and Down syndrome, etc."
4626,So.
4627,"No, while ***most*** people don't have immunocompromised children, it's more prevalent than you think."
4628,so he listened to the public and changed course?
4629,you make that sound like that is a bad thing.
4630,"Original coronavirus was said to be extremely contagious, UK variant, more contagious, and Delta even more contagious."
4631,Is there a metric to express this in terms of percentages?
4632,"Hmmm yes, the floor here is made out of floor"
4633,I'm upset because I live in a community with very low vaccination rates so I'll get to watch my friends/neighbors/extended family/coworkers go through the crap we went through in Jan-Feb again.
4634,All the while dealing with the impact of that on my job and personal life.
4635,"I'll get to worry about what another covid spike might do to our economy, especially since the industry I am in has been really hammered by this pandemic."
4636,"So I may be fairly 'safe', but I am by no means insulated from what happens to people I live around, and even by extension the entire world."
4637,This pandemic is about so much more than personal health.
4638,i'm going to toss out some math and let the masses decide if i'm right or wrong.
4639,if delta R0= chicken pox R0 then that's 5-10 people sick per person infected.
4640,if 80% are vaccinated that changes R0 to 1-2 on average.
4641,"toss in some masking, some social distance, and hopefully some common sense and that drops below 0 and we can make some progress ending this thing, right?"
4642,"edit: yes, below 1, sorry"
4643,They find the nose thing uncomfortable but they also want to be cautious.
4644,For some it’s like a charm to scare off the bad virus.
4645,"(Referring to people who do it in stores, not the people just doing it for convenience outside and pulling it up properly in stores or crowds)"
4646,"Again, no shit."
4647,"(Insert smiling and nodding Jack Nicholson GIF)

Delta variant be like: ""yesssssss, yesssss"""
4648,That was fast.
4649,1.
4650,"That is the fair premise, yes."
4651,2.
4652,It's not though.
4653,3.
4654,Definite exposure to a very small (in this case miniscule) risk vs. uncertain exposure to a very large risk is the basis of most medical interventions.

4656,"If your doctor is giving you advice than runs contrary to medical science, you should absolutely not listen to them."
4657,I would have thought that was obvious.
4658,"That happened in Portugal, for example."
4659,"Similar new cases curve, similar deaths, similar lockdown severety and dates."
4660,But half the vaccines.
4661,"Nobody expects the ~~Spanish Inquisition~~ Florida Covid 'Response', our main weapon is politics!...and greed!"
4662,Our main weapons are politics and greed!...
4663,and incompetence...
4664,"Okay, go challenge them to a fist fight or something dude."
4665,It’s just an anecdote.
4666,Calm down Chad Dickens.
4667,People may not realize that even when numbers were low in the community (I’m in Texas) that we’ve seen people die every month in the ICU from Covid.
4668,This is just from my perspective in a small ICU in the burbs of Houston.
4669,In July alone we had 4 deaths and maybe more and I’ve just forgotten.
4670,"The reason they all stand out to me is that one was 36 years old, another 30 and another 21."
4671,And the 4th to stand out was in her 60s but vaccinated with Johnson.
4672,This was when it appeared that nothing was going on in the eyes of the public.
4673,"If I saw this from my small perspective, I can only imagine what’s going on in other places like Florida unbeknownst to the general population."
4674,"It's not, we are seeing breakthrough cases in the U.K. for example."
4675,till we move the goalposts again yeah
4676,"I am not an expert, this is all so above my head that I admit I am getting fed up of the roller coaster ride type experience that this pandemic has become (or maybe always was)."
4677,"With that said, it seems like mask mandates are more than ever, keeping the honest people honest, which I guess is something, but in the long run does not seem terribly effective."
4678,I was listening to Dr. Scott Gottlieb one of the TV-experts and he said that mask mandates at this point aren't going to have much effect because the people wearing them by and large are vaccinated and were wearing them beforehand.
4679,"I get the nose thing is annoying, (possibly my lack of knowledge really shows here) but, maybe just maybe any reduction in exhalation is better than nothing, so while mouth and nose being covered would be best, a covered mouth is better than nothing?"

4737,That's it!
4738,!
4739,That's how long the study ran for.
4740,"20 weeks is ""at least this long - we have no data for longer periods."""
4741,I said to the vax.
4742,history of GBS is not cited as a risk factor by CDC.
4743,he can get the vax if he wants to.
4744,"even if he couldn't, reasonable accommodation doesn't require anyone to be put at risk."
4745,"if you're unvaxed, should be persona non grata while community spread is happening."
4746,E flat?
4747,So you're just going to pretend that all of the studies done on mask effectiveness since the start of the COVID outbreak don't exist and roll back the clock two decades to the last conclusion that you supported?
4748,"Yeah, these comments of Floridians deserve it are so insane to me."
4749,"49.2% voted for the other guy for governor, people do realize that right?"
4750,"Half of the state voted for someone different, and you’re just going to say let them die I have no sympathy?!?"
4751,What is wrong with people.
4752,"Not to mention TB, where these doctors from this article are at voted for Gillum… Gillum won that county by 9 points!"
4753,"I don’t live in Florida, but certainly feel bad for those that are going thru this and have sympathy."
4754,"Good luck to you all, and stay safe."
4755,"Interestingly, I just got a call from my wife."
4756,She was telling me that she was just informed that she was exposed to covid by a vaccinated client who contacted her to say that he tested positive shortly after meeting with her on Monday.
4757,He is vaccinated.
4758,"So is she, but she'll be tested as a precaution."
4759,The latest stats on people with vaccines and infections are not great.
4760,They are not an argument against vaccination.
4761,"They seem to prevent infection in more than half the cases and help prevent serious symptoms in most of the remaining cases, but ""everyone knows someone vaccinated that tested positive"" may not be too far from the truth if we don't get spread under control."
4762,"However, vaccines still provide enough protection to curb spread."
4763,It still seems pretty clear that the latest surge is brought to us courtesy of the unvaccinated.
4764,"For sure, but i am on a plane as we speak surrounded by older men with big honkers sticking out of the mask."
4765,Oh lol.
4766,No i genuinely didn't know.
4767,I listened to their early 90s stuff on a Fisher price radio as a kid.
4768,That’s funny.
4769,It’s also been established that my left testicle is more tolerant than my right testicle.
4770,"Oops, no."
4771,"But since, I responded to the wrong one, I'll respond here."
4772,&gt;Proof that identity politics isn't purely a liberal problem.
4773,"IMO, most of the pathologies of the right exist on the left as well, they just are not a society threatening (ignoring global warming) or so resistant to facts (vaccines are a tracking device)."

4788,There was a [study done in Israel](https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/news-perspective/2021/07/israeli-study-finds-26-covid-breakthrough-infection-rate) on transmission among healthcare workers who were fully vaccinated.
4789,They followed 1497 people.
4790,The study showed that unvaccinated people were by far the most common infection vector.
4791,"An important thing to keep in mind though is that most of these cases were the Alpha variant (which is dominant in Israel), not Delta."
4792,"Some key figures:

* 2.6% breakthrough rate (39 tested positive)
* 1/3 of cases were asymptomatic, 2/3 were mild, none required hospitalization."
4793,"* 19% reported ""long COVID"" symptoms persisting more than 6 weeks (shortness of breath, fatigue, loss of smell etc)
* **The relevant bit here: The likeliest source of infection in all cases with available tracing data was an unvaccinated person."
4794,"In 57% of cases it was someone in their household, in 30% it was a fellow healthcare worker or patient who were unvaccinated."

4821,"Cudos to being consistent in your beliefs though, I guess.."
4822,A true renaissance man
4823,"Yeah on the one hand lack of vaccines hurts everyone, on the other hand I still don't know how I feel about mandates."
4824,And on the one this mandate feels possibly too close to forcing people to take a drug.
4825,"But on the other hand this mandate is only for participation in voluntary, nonessential activities."
4826,"So instead of a mandate, it can be thought of as a business re-closure that only applies to unvaccinated folks."
4827,"Who can choose to opt in to those activities, or they can choose not to."
4828,Some of it could also be they became habituated to it.
4829,"They were wearing their masks that way at the beginning, and got used to it, so it's what they just automatically do by habit."
4830,"Doesn't make it right, of course."
4831,"But once you start a habit of doing something one way, it can be difficult to break that and start doing it another way, especially if there's no impetus to make the change."
4832,Well I can't compete with that but I had this really good slice of pizza last night.
4833,I suspect you're not qualified to make that determination.
4834,Please correct me if you have any relevant expertise here.
4835,"Yup, they're more likely to have a false negative, where COVID may not manifest respiratory symptoms, but gastro-intestinal symptoms are present."

4837,We been knew sis
4838,Providing boosters and providing initial doses aren’t mutually exclusive.

4862,Yesterday I saw near 100% masking OUTSIDE.
4863,"It's insane, there is no mandate for that, and science says that the virus doesn't spread well outside."
4864,Not everyone is more productive at home.
4865,I live 2 hours from my office so only go a couple times a month.
4866,I get more done in those couple days than do I do all my days working from home combined.
4867,Our workforce is 50% vaccinated but that specific employee is not.
4868,She has no symptoms but had stomach issues that put her out of work on Monday.
4869,"Right now, I plan to get her PCR tested to see."
4870,Her boyfriend is real sick and needs to go to the urgent care according to her.
4871,I asked if she can isolate until this clears up but unfortunately she doesn't have anywhere else to go.
4872,I will have to have her out of the rest of the week .
4873,Are countries/places really not carving out exemptions for people with medical reasons not to get vaccinated?
4874,I'm as pro vaccine as it gets but I don't think the people with autoimmune diseases or on chemo are the problem here.
4875,Make everyone who *can* get one get it and don't pound on the extremely few who genuinely can't.

4895,"The probability of having ""long covid"" is reasonably common, but long covid is a huge catch all term, covering both mild and severe eventualities."
4896,"https://www.bbc.com/news/health-58071898

In a study of children only 2% had long covid symptoms for more than 8 weeks, falling from 4% after 4 weeks, and this is an age group who are all unvaccinated in the UK."
4897,"The problem is ""long covid"" as a phrase covers everything from having a cough for a few months, to being bed bound due to sheer exhaustion."
4898,The reality is it's only a very small minority of long covid sufferers who actually suffer severe long term symptoms.
4899,"Most people suffer mild symptoms, or suffer worse symptoms but recover after a few months."
4900,It's not unusual to be sick after a viral infection.
4901,It's been happening for centuries.
4902,The probability for a fully vacinated person being severely harmed in the long term by COVID is miniscule.
4903,"Ultimately it will happen to some people, but every year non smokers die from lung cancer and people die in car accidents."
4904,Say it again for those in the back.
4905,Then there's that episode of House that made me scared to have sex for a while.
4906,"Not scared enough to stop me, but still, it was in the back of my mind."

4909,"Again, you are managing to read between the lines to get to a conspiracy to spread covid misinformation, even going as far as corrupt doctors and him lying about the doctor's advice."
4910,"In his case vaccine CAN be more dangerous than getting covid (again) and that's exactly what he stated as part of his overall explanation, and was not the major point of what he wrote."
4911,"In fact it is HARD to see any skepticism on vaccinations in his statement, but you sure did manage it."
4912,GBS ranges from almost nothing to life-destroying 24 hr care needed disease to outright fatal.
4913,"It has a very wide variety of causes, symptoms and triggers leading to flare ups."
4914,These are different in every patient.
4915,"If his personal doctor thinks that in his particular case (and any chronic medications he may be on) the risks of vaccine outweigh the potential benefits, that's that."
4916,All the CDC guidance fully agrees with that - no need for a blanket ban on covid vaccines for those with GBS but CONSULT YOUR DOCTOR.
4917,"He could ignore the doctor, get a 2nd opinion or do what he actually did, make an informed decision as a patient to not get vaccinated right now."
4918,All the guidance regarding J&amp;J and GBS etc is about **developing** GBS from a covid shot.
4919,"He already has a serious case of GBS, and another vaccination absolutely can result in adverse outcomes."
4920,"GBS|CIDP Foundation on his situation:

&gt; The risk of a former GBS patient developing GBS again from a vaccination is not known as the complication rate from vaccinations in recovered GBS patients has not been properly studied."
4921,"Members of the GBS|CIDP Foundation Global Medical Advisory Board have deliberated on the safety of immunizations for former GBS patients and offer the following guidelines: For the rare person who developed GBS within four to six weeks of receiving an immunization, **it seems prudent to avoid that vaccination in the future**."
4922,"&gt; **Ultimately, former GBS patients should discuss the pros and cons of receiving a vaccination with their primary physician to evaluate its benefits and risks**."
4923,The decision about a former GBS patient receiving or declining a flu shot **or other immunization** should be well thought out.
4924,Discussing this matter with the primary physician is likely the best means to assess a vaccine’s value.
4925,Which is exactly what he did.
4926,But all you see is corrupt doctors and vaccine misinformation.
4927,"Maybe report him to twitter, get him banned from social media?"
4928,Man's clearly a menace to society.
4929,Yes.

4950,"The nastier side effects like headaches, flu-like symptoms etc."
4951,are generally due to your immune response against the viral proteins.
4952,"If you would have had that kind of response to the proteins expressed via the vaccine, it makes no sense to think that it wouldn't be equally severe with the real virus, with the extra problem of the real virus also multiplying at the same time."
4953,"Simultaneously believing that the vaccine will kick your ass but covid itself will be nothing is pure magical thinking, probably just meant to rationalize not wanting to go out and get vaccinated."

4967,Good.
4968,Why is Virginia so red?
4969,They have a decent vaccination rate
4970,So much worse than this time last year.
4971,Schools start back next week in some counties and desantis signed an executive order saying there could be no mask mandates for students.
4972,in my area there are only 34 total available icu beds- and that’s a bit of a stretch because some of those hospitals are 45 minutes away.
4973,The one near me is at 150% occupancy.

4987,Yeah.
4988,"We conjecture that each VOC evolved within a single immunocompromised host,  gaining up to 2 dozen (for delta) mutations before somehow spreading to someone else."
4989,We see the VOCs because they're a lot more contagious than circulating lineages and grow in number.
4990,"So in theory a new host could start the process again,  but they are priorities for vaccination so the pool is much smaller now."
4991,But there's no real reason the evolution should have stopped.
4992,Maybe that host isn't even cured yet and evolution is ongoing; we haven't found the original host for any of the VOCs.
4993,"Or conversely,  delta could easily have been the apex of that evolutionary chain so additional descendants aren't any worse."

5114,You should talk to your pediatrician as they will have advice directly suited to your child’s health concerns.
5115,Smallpox killed children by the thousands if not millions.
5116,When a disease is killing children by those numbers it's a whole new ballgame.
5117,If covid was killing children by the hundreds or thousands everyday and someone walked into a grocery store without a mask they would be dragged out by a mob and be lucky if they were still alive afterwards.
5118,"Avoid reposting information, please."
5119,That depends on what 1/25 actually means.
5120,"If it is 1/25 people who are vaccinated and got the disease have severe symptoms, then cases going up doesn't affect that number."
5121,"However, if it is 1/25 vaccinated persons in general then the risk does increase."
5122,"But the change will factor in how high the rate of transmission is in the population and how that rate affect people who are vaccinated, which I don't have the exact numbers."

5177,...he hates that prick
5178,No he doesn't.
5179,The CDC stance on vaccines and GBS is that mRNA vaccines are safe and fine.

5182,It’ll just act as a booster.

5221,"I think his earlier discussion about concern over a medical condition sort or primes that bit to be read that way, so I did take it that way at first; it's the follow-up that reframed it for me."

5232,"Example on that would be Virginia, which listed .7% of cases as breakthrough cases."
5233,"For the last month or so (so, when we've had a surge), it's about 3%."
5234,"Still indicates this is a surge being driven by the vaccinated, but is a lot more accurate about what it's doing."
5235,"I do think this is mostly coming from journalists that aren't reading data sources or thinking about sampling biases, though."
5236,(I use Virginia because their department of health makes COVID numbers really easy to break down by vaccination status)
5237,Not to mention it's been literally administered a billion times.
5238,And adverse effects are tracked.
5239,So show me any trial that has involved a billion almost a billion participants.
5240,Anyone who still thinks they are going to grow a second head is crazy.
5241,There are not going to be any surprises.
5242,"We’re screwed,  no doubt."
5243,My mom told her doctor she believes she has natural immunity to Covid.
5244,she happened to be in Italy right as things were starting to shut down.
5245,No one in my extended family in Italy has gotten Covid because they're old and follow lockdown rules so obviously we're built different.
5246,Never mind her brother in Vegas that was intubated and nearly died from Covid last winter.
5247,She also exclusively watches fox news and voted for DeSantis.
5248,Mine starts 1st grade and they’re treating this year like a ‘normal’ year.
5249,And they’ve stated that they will notify students who come in close contact with Covid… but there’s no requirement to quarantine.
5250,How do you get a 6yo to wear a mask if it’s not required or enforced?
5251,I can only cross my fingers that he’ll be ok and I can get him vaccinated ASAP.

5260,Give us maskass!
5261,"yep, canadian here and I think my dose interval was 6 weeks."
5262,And I was mixed vax to boot... 1 pfizer and 1 moderna hehe.
5263,Good luck sorting out what is what in Canada... we have so many combinations and timeframes of how people got vaccinated that it will be a data nightmare to sort it all out.
5264,&gt; is largely done by the state governments with only broad guidelines set by the federal government.
5265,"This is the case with India as well, but we managed to have a single app and digital certificate mechanism."
5266,The states just use the same platform provided by the central government where a citizen's vaccine status gets updated when they receive a vaccine anywhere.
5267,"The problem with US I think is that there is disagreement on even simple fundamental aspects such as this between state and federal governments, and even individual views on whether such information should be collected / used."
5268,What should have been done is at least capture the vaccination status on a single platform and then let the states decide later on whether to actually use it for verification of individuals at a later point.
5269,"But now instead, the information doesn't exist at all."
5270,"I wonder how this is going to impact international travel, if US travelers do not have a standardized way of proving their vaccination status, though US will probably get a free pass regarding this from other countries anyways."
5271,It's funny how liberal reddit became
5272,I am up for that.
5273,Are you?
5274,This is on them.
5275,Getting the vaccine is a communal act.
5276,If you want to be a part of a community then it should not even be a discussion.
5277,But...I'm also of the more crass opinion of f..k them.
5278,Eventually they will burn themselves out and I won't have to worry about their poor choices any longer.
5279,Nope.
5280,The Jansen vaccine is the only one with elevated risk of GBS and even that is ridiculously tiny.
5281,The mRNA vaccines have no increased risk.
5282,So either his doctor is a quack or he’s full of shit.
5283,[removed]
5284,"Well I think if he ended up contracting the virus, he would have more concerns other than possibly triggering the GBS."
5285,But it clearly doesn't make sense.
5286,"It's not like they couldn't have him be a writer or producer and use another drummer for touring, especially when they've been together for so long."
5287,It's far more likely to be because he's anti-vaxx and the rest of them aren't going to put up with that shit.
5288,"For people who are interested in reports about Break Out Cases or Vaccinations reactions, Ontario has released two detailed reports."
5289,If you are worried about having a reaction to the vaccine read the data in the first report.
5290,If you are wondering if vaccines are effective- read the 2nd.
5291,If you are in the USA looking at data outside of your own country can be helpful because it sidesteps all the politics that seem to be causing problems.
5292,The data is also well documented and easily presented.
5293,"Ontario has 14 million people - which would be about the 5 or 6 largest state, and has the 4th largest city in North America (Toronto)."
5294,The reports have a long date range from December 2020 to July 2021.

2) confirmed cases of COVID-19 infection following COVID vaccination."
5296,This will address break out cases etc.
5297,"And it talks about the outcomes - how many vaccinated people died, how many were in ICU etc, in the appendix at the end."

5301,"Our far-right GOP state legislature has been overriding his vetoes on their crazier bills anyway, so I guess he didn’t think it was worth the political capital to fight them on this."
5302,So now it’s going to take legislative action to overturn it.

5312,Outside eating only works while it’s warm.
5313,They wanted to protect at least partially as many people as possible while we had little access to vaccines.
5314,That was prior to Delta when 1 dose was very very effective.

5377,Are they going to hold them down to test them?
5378,"I've been hearing all these fantasy oppression porn from some that if someone comes to knock on your door and asks you if you have been vaccinated , then the next step is they force you to get the vaccine by holding you down and injecting you, but I'm sure that crowd is cool with forcing covid tests on brown people."

5388,"For many immunocompromised people, the issue is not being unwilling to be vaxed but rather that the vaccine doesn’t work well for them."
5389,Many want to get even a 3rd dose but some just don’t mount much of a response.
5390,"Hi, im in the army and we have the option to get vaccinated tomorrow."
5391,I woke up today with a slightly runny nose and had a bit if a sore throat(we sleep in the  barracks and a lot of people get the flu/commond cold here.
5392,Everyone sick is tested for corona and so far no positive cases).
5393,"So if theoretically i feel worse tomorrow and its nothing too serious, can i still get my first vaccine or is it dangerous if i happen to have some cold or flu."
5394,I know someone who was paralyzed and ended up on a ventilator for four months by GBS following a swine flu vaccination.
5395,He recovered.
5396,Most GBS patients recover.
5397,For many the only issue is mild parasthesia/nueropathy in the hands and feet.

Not getting a vaccine isn't even fun."
5407,Like what's the upside?
5408,"Previous paragraph was to point out that college age kids are dumb and always have been, but why be dumb in a way where there's no upside to your decision?"
5409,The problem with that logic is that COVID can also cause GBS.
5410,I’m not disputing the seriousness of GBS but not following his logic either.
5411,And the fact that he shares misinformation in his post (i.e.
5412,half of those Vaxed have unexpected side effects) does not help his case.

5432,"But he's defending those ""selfish idiots"" who won't help by getting vaccinated and contributing to herd immunity, the very thing that might allow him to live a normal life."

5449,And if you read on his the statement - he basically nuances a bunch of anti vax rhetoric encouraging those people who don’t feel comfortable getting the vaccine to not get it - not just for medical reasons.
5450,Nobody is mad at people who legitimately can’t get the shot due to medical reasons.
5451,It’s the people who can &amp; won’t get the shot and put these medically compromised people at risk.
5452,His statement was irresponsible
5453,They’re being downvoted because they didn’t read the disclaimer.

5475,That's unfortunate and I'm sorry your state is doing that!
5476,It's all a coin flip.
5477,Maybe the kids will be fine and there will be treatments but people from my country won't get sufficient socialization.
5478,2 years of online learning is tough.
5479,I am fully vaxxed with my second shot(Pfizer) received in February and I had COVID(with fairly moderate symptoms) in early December of 2020.
5480,What are the chances of getting re-infected?
5481,There is going to be a law against being unvaccinated and being indoors at a restaurant.
5482,Whether that’s constitutional is another story.
5483,"HIPAA does not apply to everyone, the only people who are restricted by HIPAA are those working directly with your healthcare, like providers, health insurance, etc."

5493,Fine.
5494,"It will be at that point that no one over 12 has any excuse (and when I say over 12, I really mean the parents of 12-17 year olds) to not get it and we should be free to start excluding them from society en masse"
5495,Yup.
5496,I'd honestly love to see media outlets held accountable for misleading titles/headings.
5497,"They really need to chill with the fear-mongering, it's only going to increase vaccine hesitancy at a time when the country should be ramping up vaccination efforts..

Altho you could just as easily make the argument that people should read the whole article and not just the headline and you wouldn't be wrong lol."

5507,Oh joy.
5508,"Yeah but then in the article he goes on to spout this nonsense

&gt;	While my reason for not getting this jab is medical, I want to make sure I’m not carving out a space that is only big enough for me."
5509,"I need to state, unequivocally, that I support informed consent — which necessitates choice unburdened by coercion."
5510,"I do not find it ethical or wise to allow those with the most power (government, corporations, organizations, employers) to dictate medical procedures to those with the least power."
5511,There are countless folks (like me) for whom these shots carry a greater risk than the virus.
5512,Most of us don’t publicly share a private decision we made in careful consideration with our doctors.
5513,We know it’s not an easy conversation to unfold.
5514,"If it looks like half the population is having a shockingly different reaction to these jabs than was expected — it’s probably because their life experiences have actually been shockingly different, and their reasons range from a conscientious risk/benefit analysis, to the financial inability to take time off work/lack of health care in the event of potential side-effects, to an understandable distrust in a system that has never prioritized the health or well-being of their communities."
5515,"As if it’s completely legitimate for over half the population to not get vaccinated because they have a disease like his (20,000 cases a year in the US), or they might have to take a sick day"
5516,"If true (dubious at best) his doctor isn’t a very good one, probably a chiropractor or something"
5517,So I’m guessing this was more of a mutual thing instead of them ousting him?

5531,She has lupus and it’s pretty bad.
5532,"Her group is recommended to get the vaccine, but given how fucked up her immune system is and how it all falls down like dominoes when something goes wrong, she’s very apprehensive."
5533,"There are expected responses to the mRNA vaccine and she understands the pros and cons, but you can’t blame her for being hesitant about it."
5534,She would honestly rather quarantine for the rest next 5 years than risk a serious flare up from juggling her immune system.
5535,But this is why herd immunity exists!
5536,She doesn’t NEED the vaccine if normal fucking people get it.
5537,She’s the one who’s getting fucked over because of these other people.
5538,Gonna need a source of literally anything on a number anywhere near that.

5575,If it is I’m sure we’ll find another vaccine much sooner.
5576,Should we tighten mask mandates again?

5582,"The vaccination rate among 65 and up (large portion of the local population) is really high, but it’s much lower in younger people, and younger people are more likely to be out partying with tourists or stuck working around them."
5583,It would be unexpected for herd immunity to lead to a sudden drop such as the UK is seeing.
5584,Herd immunity isn’t either on or off so as the UK reached it (if it has) it should cause a gradual plateau and then gradual fall.
5585,Not a quick plateau and sudden drop as we’ve experienced.
5586,My parents were advised for me not to have more after a reaction as a baby (in the 80's).
5587,As an adult after some cuts while gardening i figured i probably should get a tetanus shot (they did tetanus and hepb from memory).

5594,"&gt;STORRS, Conn. (AP) — More than 800 University of Connecticut students have asked to be exempted from the school’s requirement that they be vaccinated against COVID-19 before returning for the fall semester, the school confirmed on Tuesday."
5595,&gt;UConn said it granted 55 requests for medical exemptions to the vaccine policy and 504 requests for non-medical exemptions.
5596,"Another 267 requests, all for non-medical reasons, remain under review, the school said."
5597,"&gt;The school had an enrollment last year of just over 32,600 students, including just under 19,000 undergraduates on its main campus in Storrs."

5621,Yeah I'm really confused by that comment.
5622,"If anything, it seems that maybe the Euros helped weirdly - the people who were congregating indoors in pubs and houses to watch the games together from my experience were in the younger lower-risk demographics who are less likely to be fully vaccinated."
5623,"The data shows that this wave was largely a big concurrent spike in cases in those age groups, and it may have led to Delta quickly running out of non-vaccinated, non-previously infected hosts and running out of steam much quicker than if the Euros hadn't happened."
5624,"Also, schools were open, and the current case decline began before they had closed for the summer holidays."
5625,"Finally, almost everyone I know had either uninstalled the app, turned off the bluetooth, or just flat out ignored the pings that were going out."
5626,It got to a point where anyone still with the app installed was getting pinged a bunch and people stopped caring and ignored it so as to not ruin their summer plans with 10 days of isolation.
5627,"Might sound selfish to people in places with stricter adherence to restriction measures, but it doesn't seem to have negatively affected things here."
5628,"I don't make this comment to claim I have solid reasons for the current drop, I'm no expert myself."
5629,But anyone like OP making authoritative claims on the reasons is kind of showing their own ignorance of the situation.
5630,"For what it's worth, my personal opinion is that since 92% of adults had antibodies a month before the drop, covid has basically run out of symptomatic hosts for the time being."

5675,In regards to hospitalizations it made the vaxed group significantely less likely to end up there.
5676,"I didn't see any evidence of significant reduction in mortality once you got in the hospital, but that makes sense, the vaccine probably did little to nothing if you still ended up hospitalized."

5886,"&gt; lets hope it stays that way during flu season in 2 months time, thats the question mark for me."
5887,Agree.
5888,This is why it was also important to open up when we did.
5889,Had we waited a few more months we would also have had flu season to contend with and people would be spending far more time indoors due to the inevitable inclement UK weather.
5890,That would have been a bad combination.
5891,Opening now and seeing a minor uptick which doesn't overwhelm hospitals is IMO far more preferable than waiting to see what would have happened if we'd reopened society during a period when transmissible respiratory diseases are known to be at their most contagious.

5962,"Seems like even where I live, some folks just hit a wall."
5963,"Isn't ""keeping as many tools in your tool box available"" like politics 101?"
5964,Like that's why politicians never give straight answers - it allows them to be flexible and not be bogged down by something they previously committed.
5965,How stupid of him to not think a few months out.
5966,Side effects?
5967,"They'll pass for sure, I had them with my 2nd shot."
5968,"I'm super pro-vaccine and got it the second I could, but I felt anxious both times, I totally understand."
5969,"After a year and a half of pandemic, I think a lot of us are on edge."
5970,What are you experiencing?
5971,Gotcha.
5972,So once triggered it stays triggered like an on/off switch or each trigger event (if it occurs) is like it’s own separate spectrum of potential symptomality?
5973,"
&gt;&gt;	While my reason for not getting this jab is medical, I want to make sure I’m not carving out a space that is only big enough for me."
5974,"I need to state, unequivocally, that I support informed consent — which necessitates choice unburdened by coercion."
5975,"I do not find it ethical or wise to allow those with the most power (government, corporations, organizations, employers) to dictate medical procedures to those with the least power."
5976,There are countless folks (like me) for whom these shots carry a greater risk than the virus.
5977,Most of us don’t publicly share a private decision we made in careful consideration with our doctors.
5978,We know it’s not an easy conversation to unfold.
5979,"If it looks like half the population is having a shockingly different reaction to these jabs than was expected — **it’s probably because their life experiences have actually been shockingly different, and their reasons range from a conscientious risk/benefit analysis, to the financial inability to take time off work/lack of health care in the event of potential side-effects,** 

This bit is where he descends into bs imo, how different does someones experience have to be to lack understanding of the nuance involved and not believe everything some shock jock tells you?"
5980,"It's the tired old argument of ""catching it is safer than potential vaccine adverse effects""."
5981,also misinformation though...
5982,"The app changes were made yesterday, so irrelevant when talking about the fall in cases we’ve seen."
5983,"Also they are not changing the sensitivity, just reducing the time between contact and a positive test to warrant a ping."
5984,Distance/time sensitivity is not changed.
5985,"and people clearly were using it (685k pings a week), and people were isolating regardless of if it was enforceable or not, hence why they had to change it to ping fewer people."

5991,Switzerland (which isn’t even part of the EU) made their own national QR code that is compatible with the EU system.
5992,They rolled it out like a month ago and it’s been working great so far.
5993,It’s called the “Covid Zertificate.” They give you a QR code piece of paper and/or an app for your phone.
5994,(Or you can store it in your phone wallet).
5995,It’s an official certificate to show you’ve been vaccinated or have antibodies from getting infected.
5996,"https://www.bag.admin.ch/bag/en/home/krankheiten/ausbrueche-epidemien-pandemien/aktuelle-ausbrueche-epidemien/novel-cov/covid-zertifikat.html

You use the QR code to attend any big events or parties or to travel outside the country."
5997,It’s pretty straightforward.
5998,"Your wife sounds like she’s scared and possibly uninformed, or maybe just crazy but I’m not here to judge, the fact she won’t talk to her doctor warrants a serious sit down conversation."
5999,The life long side effects from getting covid is different for everyone but the potential for clotting disorders/ heart problems/ lung problems far outweighs the side effects from the vaccines…..the vaccine doesn’t fully prevent you from getting it but at least you won’t end up on a ventilator as far as most studies have seen (I did a lot of clinical work in the ICU and the last thing anyone wants is to be on a vent).

6012,"I think they wanted to present us with a binary choice that’s been around in health care settings for a while… get vaccinated, or wear a mask."
6013,A lot of hospitals require staff who don’t get the flu shot to wear a mask.
6014,"My workplace has done this, which I like because it gives a different meaning to masks, since it’s exactly the opposite of how it was… now the only people wearing them are the idiots."
6015,"The fact is, a lot of people will choose not to get vaccinated for covid and.or the flu and it’s kind of an important thing to know this about people."
6016,This might be a choice that’s presented in other workplaces when flu season comes around.
6017,"But yeah, I agree that we should have waited until kids under 12 are able to get vaccinated… though I honestly didn’t believe it would take this long."
6018,"And it shouldn’t have gone from “literally everywhere ever” to “nah, you don’t need one, and we’re never going to ask if you’re vaccinated so yeah let’s party and fuck!”"

6082,Nobody is making you wear it so why bother if you’re not gonna do it correctly?
6083,The only reasonable explanation is that 18 months into this there are still people who legitimately don’t know that the mask has to also cover your nose to be effective.

6085,From your link.
6086,"Overall, across these 40 states, the percent of White people who have received at least one COVID-19 vaccine dose (48%) was roughly 1.3 times higher than the rate for Black people (36%) and 1.2 times higher than the rate for Hispanic people (41%) as of July 19, 2021."

6099,"In my experience, I’ve never heard anyone use the “kids are resilient” line when they’re about to do something actually beneficial for a child."

6118,I’ve heard there’s a problem when you keep using the adenovirus vector.
6119,If I get it again my immune system will attack the adenovirus (that’s carrying the DNA for the spike protein) faster and I won’t get much “covid” resistance.
6120,What I’ve heard is this vector is good for “one and done” and then don’t take that type of vaccine for a few years.
6121,"It's also largely cultural, which is difficult to talk about."

6202,Many people have gotten insomnia after their shots.

6213,We have way less control over spread than we’d like to think we do and the US will be done with this surge in another month or so while other parts of the world are just getting started again.
6214,I have to agree with him this time.
6215,EDIT: Vaccinations certainly do reduce illness prevalence and severity but COVID waves are still going to occur for reasons humans don't understand and can only guess at.
6216,"At this point, all we have to go on is how the virus has behaved historically without knowing the ""why""."
6217,Keep in mind only around 60% of the population is vaccinated.

6236,And turning all against the one is an art that's hard to teach
6237,The vaccine's side effect profile is mild cold symptoms.

6279,"I feel for those patients I really do, but what kind of care do you think they are receiving when their nurse is overworked in unsafe conditions?"
6280,"Nurses aren’t martyrs, we deserve fair pay and safe working conditions, and our healthcare system cannot sustain this."
6281,"Something has to
change."
6282,"For now the hospital will bring in travel nurses that cost 4x as much and the patient will end up paying for it, but at some point something will have to change."
6283,There is not enough data on it yet so I understand the hesitancy.

6286,Yesterday was the first day the US had &gt;100K new cases since February 12.
6287,"104,758 per Worldometers."
6288,"Over half of those total cases were accounted for by 5 states - FL, TX, CA, GA, LA."
6289,"If you sort by new deaths rather than new cases, MS and AZ are almost certainly massively undercounting cases and are probably on par with FL in terms of actual new cases."
6290,"I'm not going to speak to the politics of China, but my wife is in China and I was there last year in January-February."
6291,The reaction that I saw and experienced from the general populous as compared to that of USA is different.
6292,Her city of a few million people had 1 case pop up last week and the city has done a semi-serious lockdown and everyone in the city is being tested.
6293,"Not something that could happen in the USA, but the reaction and handling of this is very different between western countries and China."
6294,"It does sound like their are increased cases, but for the longest time they've been much closer to 'normal' then what USA has been living with in part due to their reaction."
6295,"Most of the increases have been due to increase in traveling, border town traffic, similarly to Korea some branches of Churches."
6296,Tbh I think a lot of things we’re seeing probably have a lot to do with stress and could peter out once things have settled down.
6297,Like last year during lockdown my period stopped for a couple months because I already have an anxiety disorder and I was freaking OUT.
6298,I haven’t gotten covid as far as I know and they’d come back by the time I was calmer.
6299,Did you read the whole thing?

6301,Paywall.
6302,"But I'll give you the first sentence under the title:

6304,"""**"
6305,Data that backs that up?
6306,Thanks
6307,"And if it helps, I know a lot of people who got pregnant after being vaccinated or are currently pregnant and doing fine."
6308,I have both of mine and haven’t noticed anything different.
6309,My periods did lighten but I think that has to do with going off my birth control at around the same time.
6310,They haven’t been any different than normal otherwise though.
6311,So are we at herd immunity yet?
6312,Lol

6317,Never say never.
6318,"If there is going to be another variant that escapes current vaccines, there will be another lockdown."
6319,The financial aspect is irrelevant.
6320,Government spending will drive the economy because countries around the world have decided to go into debts to weather the pandemic.
6321,"Since sovereign debts increase worldwide, the relative threshold at which a government goes into bankruptcy has increased."
6322,"I agree it shouldn't be on the taxpayers, but I don't have a solution."
6323,I'm just saying that the line of thought of 'there's a job shortage and they could just get jobs' doesn't pan out for many of the people in these forbearance situations.
6324,"Like cool, Jill got a job at the local grocery store."
6325,She now makes $12.
6326,"She still owes months of back rent, plus her current rent, and needs to pay for whatever else to survive."
6327,There's simply not enough money there to make headway.
6328,"So I keep seeing people say the vaccine doesn’t prevent spread at all, but that isn’t true, is it?"
6329,"I thought the point was that it lowered your chance of spreading it, but it’s still a possibility."
6330,I’m just trying to undo a lot of “vaccines don’t work” stuff.
6331,"Considering the singer of the band has a PhD in, no shit, the mRNA sequences of HIV and how they pertain to infectiousness, they are possibly *the* most informed washed up band of 60 year old guys singing their 3 hits **ever**."
6332,You have to admit that irony is delicious.
6333,I think that population stat is the other way around buddy ;)
6334,"Draconian approach saved lives, how hard is it to understand?"
6335,I'm not talking about the data from Israel.
6336,I'm talking about PHE data [from May](https://www.gov.uk/government/news/covid-19-vaccines-further-evidence-of-success) regarding the effectiveness of the vaccine on breakthrough cases of mostly Alpha cases.
6337,And then shortly after a study [showing a slight reduction](https://www.gov.uk/government/news/vaccines-highly-effective-against-b-1-617-2-variant-after-2-doses) of stopping infection from the Delta variant.

6339,"To date, no cases of GBS have been reported following vaccination in participants in the mRNA COVID-19 vaccine clinical trials."
6340,So you're saying that the US only had a 2 week lockdown because of who ordered it?
6341,So everything being closed wasn't a lockdown because the governor ordered it and not the president?
6342,Okkkkkkkkkk.
6343,I'm also not sure why you are ao hung up on churches either.
6344,"Schools, restaurants,  all of the arts, the majority of storesa lot of outside spaces, mental health services,  routine medical and dental care, were also closed down as well."
6345,Maybe all that is just a minor inconvenience for you but it majorly screwed up a lot of people's lives.
6346,"Not saying that dying of covid is a better alternative but pretending that people are upset because ""they're spineless jellyfish who want to go to church "" is a little dishonest."
6347,"&gt;We also don’t track everyone’s movements with spyware in their phone so we cant identify everyone

Nice try , buddy."
6348,Seems the decline is plateauing.
6349,It’ll probably level soon.
6350,Thank god y’all voted the orange shitgibbon out of office.
6351,Can you imagine the deaths by now…
6352,"The part where he said he already had it and it wasn't that bit annoyed me as well, that's another standard covid denier anti vaxx idiot line"
6353,It might be.
6354,"However, hopefully it will allow more companies/employers to require the vaccine."
6355,I used to work internationally and I was required to get a plethora of vaccinations.
6356,"Some places just aren't going to require it until it has full FDA approval, which I also can understand."

6368,"I'm pretty sure it's not lupus, it's never lupus."
6369,&gt;Has the US ever done any form of comprehensive testing?
6370,Or do we only ever test when people show up at the hospital?
6371,No.

6401,&gt; The reliance on nebulous feel-good concepts like “positivity” and “hope” have crushed us from actually dealing with this thing realistically from day one.

6403,"There's your hope, optimism, and collective effort."
6404,It is noticeably absent in our part of the world these days.
6405,Antibodies waning.
6406,It’s to be expected.
6407,The memory cells will hold down the fort.
6408,The proof is in the effectiveness against severe COVID.
6409,"Also, Israel’s health director said two days ago that vaccinated individuals who are infected have a 50% reduction in transmission, and 80% of them don’t even infected one person."
6410,This isn’t bad news at all.
6411,"This tells me the memory cells kick into gear, and beat The hell out of the virus swiftly and quickly reducing transmission within a community."
6412,Boosters for the most at risk and healthcare workers in clinical settings.
6413,The rest of the general population is fine.
6414,Those doses should go to the rest of the world.
6415,"Get vaccinated, people."
6416,Meanwhile Dexter has the right to tell him to shut up and take it since he studied viruses for his PHD

6419,"I'm in a very red part of Virginia, and our school district has made masking recommended but not required."

6428,Yeah in the UK it shifted around as vaccine demand this exit wave required.
6429,We got ours a bit early (surplus) and booked our second dose at the time when the guidance said 12 weeks.

6444,!
6445,"HEEEYYYYYY, are you talking back to me?"
6446,... outta the band.
6447,We already had data out literally months ago that the vaccine reduces your chance of severe disease (once you manage to contract it) only by about ~half.
6448,"And no one has talked about it, and people refuse to believe it."
6449,"Throw in the fact that the vaccine is only stopping about as many infections, and the notion that vaccinated people can go back to full pre-pandemic behavior and forget this whole experience is reckless."
6450,I'm hoping a booster will significantly assist here.
6451,But in the interim vaccinated people need to take a fucking chill pill and put a mask back on and avoid crowded spaces.
6452,[removed]
6453,We've recently gone from 12 weeks to 6 in Sydney as our cases continue to climb.
6454,Props to Dexter and Noodles for not engaging on the specifics of this one - there's a classic misinformation tactic being used that only gains traction if debated.
6455,1.
6456,Take a solid truth: some people can't be vaccinated for medical reasons.
6457,2.
6458,"Add an undisprovable personal circumstance: Pete has a medical condition
3."
6459,"Then use this reasonable premise to slip in the lie: that the vaccine can be more harmful than the virus

If he'd just said the third part outright then the lie would be blatant, but now it's caught up in a plausible truth so the focus can always be shifted back to that when called out."
6460,But obviously you can't pull that shit with your microbiologist friend.
6461,"If your body can't cope with the vaccine, it definitely can't cope with the virus."
6462,The condition he refers to is specifically triggered by catching viruses.
6463,This is so excruciatingly obvious to someone who has studied virology that there's no point engaging with it and allowing less informed people to see it as a debatable point.
6464,"It's a shame there are still some giving him the benefit of the doubt here, but like I said, it's deliberate misinformation and it's designed to be hard to spot."
6465,Tested positive for Covid yesterday.
6466,Have been fully vaccinated since April (Pfizer).
6467,Thought I just had a cold until I realized I couldn't smell anything.
6468,Feeling fine for the most part(although felt pretty crappy over the weekend) but never expected to be a breakthrough case.
6469,Thankful for the vaccine that my symptoms are mild.
6470,"Its not misinformation, however you can always manipulate data to suit whichever narrative you follow."
6471,"The fact is, as far as the UK is concerned, it's over."
6472,For now at least.
6473,Should we expect that to remain the case though?

6478,There were actually several pregnancies during the vaccine trials; that information is available with a simple search.
6479,It is well known that the virus - if you catch it - can change menstrual cycles: [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7522626/](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7522626/)

6484,I know several other females same thing happened.
6485,"Now, from what I understand by my doctor this is normal."
6486,"Also, women are under a lot of stress."
6487,Parenting during the pandmeic and just stress in general can throw off cycles.
6488,I still would live a good peer reviewed article to show my hesitant female friends.
6489,I do not regret my decision to get vaccinated.
6490,Getting pregnant and having kids during a virus surge would not be fun.
6491,It wasn't that different.
6492,"When o pointed out then that vaccinated people could still catch Covid, and that of they did catch Covid they were encouraging the spread of more vsccine-tolerabt strains I was met with denial and dowmvotes."
6493,"We knew that some strains back then were more transmissible and more vaccine tolerant already, so it shouldn'tve been controversial."
6494,"The person in question claims to have gotten their shot in a different state, hence I can’t look them up in our states database."
6495,It’s one of the reasons I’m suspicious
6496,I was going to write it off as just being my own personal experience because someone else responded similarly - but both you guys are outside the US.

6502,"Since these Delta outbreaks, they certainly are not done."

6504,I don’t blame you at all!
6505,It's pretty sickening.

6515,Cases came down naturally by themselves
6516,In other words...the people least concerned about COVID to continue to be unconcerned about COVID.
6517,We can't force people to get vaccinated.
6518,"We can encourage them to be vaccinated by requiring vaccine passports to be in buildings open to the public, have employers require employees to be vaccinated, have public schools require students to be vaccinated, and require anyone entering the country to be vaccinated but other than that there isn't much else we can do to coax people to get vaccinated."
6519,"I hope all of these things are implemented but at some point we'll just have to accept that COVID, just like the Spanish flu which was H1N1, is never going to go away and will circulate forever among mammals."
6520,Now hopefully we can keep decreasing the death rate and improve medical care but COVID is not going to go away.
6521,Even if everyone was vaccinated it would still be circulating but most carriers would simply be asymptomatic.

6602,Hi Dr. Nick!
6603,Will you let me know too.
6604,My dads in same boat.
6605,I'm considering my kids' elementary school based on the statistics presents.
6606,"Is delta is as bad as they say and it infects 100% of the kids, even if they had the original covid, about 52 kids would be sick for a month, about 21 or so would be sick for multiple months."
6607,"That's not good, but it does help set some expectations."
6608,I'm still concerned about the unknown possibilities of covid causing developmental or chronic health problems though.
6609,He needs funds to pay for it and that requires Congress to pass something.
6610,I see nothing in your post that sounds anything like a blanket statement about military members.
6611,Not sure what he or she is going on about...
6612,"Wow, this is a great way for homeless people etc to make money"
6613,Cause Operation Warp Speed?
6614,"Legit question, a government agency can issue an order they've been told by the Supreme Court they shouldn't be issuing as long as the Supreme Court isn't in session to stop them?"
6615,"Per the [CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccinesafety/ensuringsafety/monitoring/vaers/index.html), the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) is used to collect reports of adverse events after vaccination from the general public."
6616,This is primarily used to identify potential topics to further investigate with regards to vaccine reactions.
6617,"However, because the event data in VAERS is often not verified and is often self-reported, it should not be assumed that the adverse events in VAERS are actually associated with or cause by the vaccines, nor is it possible to estimate the frequency of these adverse events from these data."

6621,He’s an expert in the field of cancer research.
6622,"If it was a cancer study, I’d agree with you."
6623,"This is a study about how a virus spreads, meaning a virologist or immunologist is going to be better able to speak to the study’s quality than this guy is."
6624,"It's just a bureaucratic step, requiring review of all the case report forms from the clinical trials and not depending on the company's summaries of the data."
6625,There is no safety data to wait for-- that was all available for the EUA.
6626,Current and every former head of FDA and CDC says the vaccines are safe and effective.
6627,The danger you expose yourself to in waiting for this paperwork is infinitely greater than the benefit.
6628,"I would argue that people who choose to not get the shot, using informed consent as their reason for exemption, aren't actually informed."
6629,It's a bit of a catch 22.
6630,&gt; Where’d this ~~labor~~ **wage** shortage come from?!
6631,/s
6632,What component of the vaccine(s) do you believe will lead to those effects?
6633,[removed]
6634,Thank you!
6635,Sounds reasonable.
6636,"Are there places the unvaccinated are not allowed to go (restaurants, movies, gyms, etc."
6637,)?
6638,Did you read article?
6639,"The dude has, if true, a rare medical condition that causes his immune system to attack his nerves and can leave him paralyzed."
6640,So Holland would understand.
6641,And seems they do as they are all on good terms after this announcement.
6642,No vaxx shaming here or denouncing vaxx.
6643,Arrest him.
6644,This is genocide.
6645,"In this dataset, more than 9 out of 10 cases are among the unvaccinated, but a lot of data was collected when vaccination rates were low and before delta arrived."
6646,Is this what’s being done now?
6647,People being OUTED for not being vaccinated?
6648,"So Desantis says the current covid crisis in Florida is just ""Media hysteria""?"
6649,Higher infection and hospitalization numbers than any time in 2020?
6650,"Can you imagine the families of people who are crowding the ICU's, seeing the Governor spouting this glib, argumentative bs?"

6658,I cannot take much more of this.
6659,At what point do I just throw in the towel?
6660,It’s not getting any better.
6661,"If vaccines were free and unlimited, most of the world’s 6 billion people would still not receive one anytime soon."
6662,Truth.
6663,"Yes, everyone is entitled to their opinion, but not every opinion carries the same weight."
6664,I just value his opinion a bit more than others since he is an expert in the field.
6665,"If he says the study is of poor quality, I would tend to trust him over a virologist with no specialty in the quality of studies."
6666,"So, we have the opportunity to rid our military of a bunch of absolute idiots?"
6667,And they'll leave voluntarily?
6668,Remind me again what the downside of this is.
6669,"Can't tell you that, but I've sure been crop dusting my couch this evening."
6670,"Interesting, my daughter 11y/o had cold symptoms (running nose, cough, congestion, sleeping a lot), so I called her pediatrician, nurse basically tried to talk me out of getting her tested unless she was going to come into contact with someone who is high risk like grandparents."
6671,"So I took her to primary health, similarly not super excited to give the test, made me request it about 3 times (as part of larger discussion, etc."
6672,"), she was in contact with a known positive, although not clear on the details like timing of infection on the positive case relative to when she was around my daughter."
6673,"She came back negative about 24 hours later, but the experience was odd to me, I expected them to say yup, lets test her at the slightest symptom."
6674,This is what will like cause college and university classes to go remote again.
6675,Depends so much on where you live.
6676,Right now in Virginia for instance everything is open you can go nearly everywhere maskless etc.
6677,My life is pretty much the same right now as it was in 2019.
6678,This study was conducted pre-Delta.
6679,"In order to deploy I had to get a small pox vaccine, small pox has been eradicated from spread for decades, the only reason why you get it is because the DoD is paranoid that somewhere someone has weaponized small pox ready to unleash on us troops."
6680,"If the CDC can implement an eviction moratorium nationwide, why can't they implement a mask mandate for schools nationwide or at least the ability for schools to choose to require masks?"
6681,"Or it’s just another wave, which by definition rises and falls."
6682,Literally every single wave and people have said “this is herd immunity now”.
6683,I was born with a heart condition that makes me weary of getting the vaccine.
6684,If I knew that there were no long term side effects and the very very small chance of heart swelling wouldn’t effect me I’d get it.
6685,"But as of now my doctor says I should hold off until more data is available because I’ve already had Covid, had a mild case, and got an antibody test to make sure I have some protection."
6686,I don’t want to be barred entry to the gym because of something I’ve been advised not to get.
6687,"My wife has the vaccinr, I don’t, do we eat separate now?"
6688,A lot of variables are left out here
6689,Is this specific to any variant?
6690,I’m assuming not delta if it is referring to Jan.
6691,"I’m sorry, you’re suggesting using Instagram selfies as a method of validation??"
6692,"So if someone didn’t pose for a picture for their shot, they’re looked at with more suspicion?"
6693,?
6694,Sort of ([cdc underlying conditions site](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/recommendations/underlying-conditions.html)).

6714,You can tell his argument is coming from someone uneducated or unaware how to interpret the data.
6715,There are reasons for the variations.
6716,Vaccine vs vaccine or covid naive vs covid exposed immune systems.
6717,Not 50% of the population have vaccine reactions.
6718,The symptoms experienced after vaccination is a proper immune response to a vaccine in the vast majority of cases.
6719,We've vaccinated close to 60k in my city so far and have had 0 adverse events or vaccine reactions.
6720,Only people having anxiety attacks.
6721,"TL:DR 

Providers are worried about being left on the hook for the cost of unofficial booster shots/various hand waving about it not being approved."
6722,"I got a third Pfizer shot, had more moderate side effects than my second Pfizer shot, and my wife had a very similar reaction to the third shot."
6723,I'm not gonna wait until the CDC/FDA accrue the necessary body count before authorizing a third shot because they're terrified of handing anti-vaxxers a talking point.
6724,I'm not gonna be a part of that body count as a cancer survivor if I can help it.
6725,If you detect condescension towards the CDC/FDA it is intentional.
6726,The UK had a large amount of young people with only one dose when the Delta wave hit.
6727,Something like 75-80% of the people under 35 were only single vaxxed.
6728,That has shown to have little efficacy against infection and I think we all know by now that 18-35 are probably the biggest spreading group with the most social connections.
6729,It will be interesting to see if restaurants will turn away large parties because some aren't vaccinated.
6730,"Many seem to be struggling to stay open as it is, now there's a worker shortage."
6731,"""pretty treatable"" dude."

6752,"A lot of “more than people would think” and “surprisingly often”, but you never seem to give any concrete numbers or information."
6753,"I know the numbers exist, I’ve referenced them before, and I don’t think they help your case here."
6754,"Edit: If anyone’s curious, the (unconfirmed, but still used by the CDC) VAERS data reports ~1-1.2 cases of GBS **per million doses administered** of the mRNA vaccines, which is about equal to the background occurrence of GBS."
6755,"The JNJ data is a tiny bit higher, at -8 per million, so if you have a history... Just get the other vaccines."

6911,"In fact, you are more likely to spread it asymptomatically while young compared to older population groups."
6912,So from what I've gathered so far you have no idea how this disease operates and yet you are complaining about the actions of those who were actually informed.

6983,Viral infections and their outcomes rely on viral inoculation.
6984,The more virus introduced to the body the better foothold it can get because each particle is replicating.
6985,The 78-88% number for infection protection is dependent of a lot of factors.
6986,That number isn’t static - it’s a probability.
6987,Viral inoculation is one of those factors - that’s part of the reason why the cdc was saying vaccinated people shouldn’t hang with unvaccinated people unless there were masks involved.
6988,The more often or the more quality of the virus introduced to the immune system.
6989,The more the immune response is going to be tested.

7012,"I was very cautious and in full panic mode for my parents safety before being vaccinated, but now the chances of dying of COVID are incredibly low in a vaccinated person."
7013,"In January 4,000 people a day were dying."
7014,The 7 day rolling average right now is 300-400 and these are 99% unvaccinated people.
7015,All I’m getting at is the fact that the “think of the children” routine makes absolutely zero sense when you look at the numbers.
7016,"1,800 died in ‘09, which is a tragedy."
7017,"But, if you look at all the data, this is a very low fatality rate and wasn’t much cause for panic at the time, so why all the panic over 350 which is less than 1/3 of H1N1??"
7018,?
7019,The lockdowns were originally only to be two weeks long.
7020,That is where the phrase comes from.
7021,They proceeded to violate millions of Americans freedom to assemble at their places of work and worship for months on end.
7022,"That is what happened, is it not?"
7023,The homeless born in the USA are US citizens with voting rights.
7024,[Here](https://www.coalitionforthehomeless.org/get-help/know-your-rights/voting-rights/) is an organization helping them to do so.
7025,In general the people fighting voter ID requirements are doing so to protect voting rights of already disenfranchised groups.
7026,I gave an example of the homeless specifically because they are a great example of people we see every day who would not satisfy the criteria that you gave.
7027,"Sometimes when everyone we interact with is in roughly the same social class as us, it is hard to see who would be affected."

7039,"Denying healthcare is wrong, even if it’s something that could have been prevented."
7040,Oh good.
7041,I feel better now.
7042,Should we expect this virus to mutate to a weaker state as vaccinations go up?
7043,Sounds like a great idea.
7044,Just enjoy the pre-apocalyptic part for the next few years while climate change effects are just starting to get nasty.
7045,Staggering the jab dates is a structural requirement.
7046,There isn’t enough medical staff to do otherwise.
7047,That doesn’t alter the reality that time off is going to be a huge issue.
7048,Yeah that's what I thought.

7071,"Makes sense, part of the reason kids don't get sick as often or as badly is they have less receptors that COVID binds too."
7072,"Buuuuuuut if you increase the viral load by a thousand percent, that changes the game."
7073,Enter Delta variant.
7074,I can NOT wait until under 12 gets approval.
7075,One nervous dad.

7224,Unvaccinated kids will largely be fine.
7225,School staff were prioritized for vaccination for a reason.
7226,It’s not March of 2020 anymore and the hospital system will be fine with vaccines + natural immunity.

7274,Google and Apple already have support for Bluetooth contact tracing and storing digital vaccine passports in your digital wallet.
7275,Places just need to actually support and use it.
7276,"I don’t think anyone is saying it’s a save all fix, but it absolutely does reduce chances of getting it vs. not being vaccinated."
7277,Yeah.
7278,There's really no end goal to it which is a bit frustrating
7279,I'm not terribly sure was just answering you question really.
7280,I'd hope he consulted his doctor before making a decision that cost him his band gig.
7281,The article and the UK situation in general isn’t the rosy picture we may think.
7282,The article makes it clear that people’s contacts are down 50% from interactions pre-pandemic.
7283,"This is due to schools closing for summer, workplaces continuing to offer work from home, and, what NOBODY in the US talks about weirdly, the fact Britain has a contact tracing app that enforces quarantine on potentially exposed individuals (I have no idea why this is never mentioned as a factor for why UK cases may be coming down)."
7284,A doubling of the interactions would seem to me to bring cases right back up so it’s not as if the UK is back to normal.
7285,"What the UK has taught us is covid cases can decline IF:

* Schools are fully closed

*  Eligible population is highly vaccinated"
7286,H1N1 was far less dangerous than COVID.
7287,"An estimated 284,000 people died of H1N1 globally of an estimated 700 million to 1.4 billion suspected cases; COVID has killed 4.25 million people out of 200 million cases so far."
7288,COVID has killed more people in the US alone than all but the highest estimates of *global* deaths caused by H1N1.
7289,"&gt;nobody batted an eye 

That's just plain not true at all."
7290,"To this day, there are still complaints that the WHO overblew the severity of the H1N1 pandemic."
7291,"&gt; the governor made it forbidden and legally punishable for any government entity including school districts to have any sort of rules about masks

Why is this okay?"
7292,How is this reasonable?
7293,"Not being complete idiots, they were embarrassing Dear Leader."
7294,I am certain that this is a severe undercount.
7295,[removed]
7296,Well new data is showing that it doesn't reduce transmissibility of the delta so they aren't completely wrong.
7297,There's a lot we still don't know.
7298,The vaccine certainly helps reduce symptoms but I don't think it's a save all fix
7299,That is the BIG question.
7300,In my case my insurance paid for the vax.
7301,"In doing so they prevented me from going to the hospital which would have cost thousands, still paid mostly by my insurance which is paid by my employer."
7302,So business is on the hook for it.
7303,"Uninsured folks were covered by the state and/or the Feds, IOW you and I paid for it in our taxes."
7304,Vaxing is cheaper than not vaxing.
7305,Kinda like an oil change.
7306,And as a taxpayer and health insurance buyer that’s my bottom line.
7307,"A vaccine is a few hundred bucks, tops."
7308,Now think about the cost of treatment for the unvax’d who are spending weeks at the ICU.
7309,Tens of thousands of dollars each.
7310,Some well into the hundreds of thousands.
7311,Whole wards full of these people who didn’t have to be there.
7312,Who is paying for THAT?
7313,We are.
7314,The cost of it all gets folded into our already ridiculous health care costs.
7315,I’m thinking maybe we should send the bill to Fox News.
7316,&gt;	I swear reddit told me yesterday that 70% of eligible people in the US have received at least one dose so far.
7317,Over 70% of adults have received at least one vaccine shot
7318,"Yes, I did know that."
7319,"I am not sure what your point is though, these are two different subjects."
7320,"Unless your point is that there is injustice in the world, and if that is your point then I agree with you!"
7321,So let’s fight injustice together!
7322,"The UN actually is trying to combat injustice, with varying degrees of success."
7323,If it were properly funded it could probably do more.
7324,"The World Food Program, a UN agency won the Nobel peace prize this year for it’s work combating hunger."
7325,Many UN agencies directly or indirectly work to end world hunger.
7326,"https://research.un.org/en/foodsecurity/key-un-bodies
Also world hunger has also been almost halved over the last 20 years, from 15 to 8.9%, thanks in part to the research and work of the UN."
7327,Well duh
7328,I mean Brits seem to be doing fine despite going for Freedom Day.
7329,Though I‘d still wait for school openings before celebrating.
7330,"And seasonal aspects might be relevant (for example, UK has had a calm summer last year, while in places like Texas or Florida it was the time when things worsened - not sure if that was just coincidence or something seasonal)"
7331,/sigh
7332,Imagine being so beholden to Dear Leader than your family dies of covid and you hide it so he doesn't have to admit anything...
7333,"He believes in germs, for sure."
7334,Started spraying everything with rubbing alcohol when he brings it home from the store when the pandemic started.
7335,He won't hear of it being airborne though.
7336,Maybe because not being able to just kill it with Lysol makes him feel powerless and vulnerable?
7337,"I would guess (I don't talk to him that often because it's an exercise in futility and frustration) that he doesn't argue with science that he's known for years, school science."
7338,He just doesn't trust anything that FOX News told him to be distrustful of.
7339,Is it safe to go to restaurants (especially ones that are “popping”) and eat indoors if everyone in your party and yourself are vaccinated?
7340,Because hospitals filling up and more supply chain issues make for a lousy time for everyone.
7341,There were no universal mask mandates or lockdowns for H1N1.
7342,"In the same time period that Covid has killed almost 400 kids, the flu has killed 0."
7343,"Looking at the deaths in NY, this new vaccine pass requirement seems even more absurd."
7344,"It won’t be enforced until September, meaning this restriction will last even after delta subsides (not that there is even a major surge here at the moment anyway, but I digress)."
7345,"NYC will have to deal with tourists as well, meaning there can’t ever be a time when they say “ok!"
7346,enough New Yorkers are vaccinated and we’re in the clear!” There is no end game guys.
7347,"Unless people push back, this is reality for good."
7348,I didn’t want to believe that it would come to this.
7349,"The precedent being set is awful, regardless of how you feel about people who choose not to get vaccinated."
7350,I myself am left wondering why I got vaccinated in the first place if we’re still in hysterics over every person who gets sick.
7351,"I'm sad I had to scroll down to see this, I read it too."
7352,"The guy really did not come off as an anti vaxxer, he has Guillain-Barré syndrome..."
7353,I'd be listening to my doctor's advice too.

7406,Meanwhile here in the US it’s fucking everywhere all in the name of “freedom”.

7416,Theres no evidence to support hildren being a major vector of covid.
7417,&gt;	B) I dont even know what you’re talking about with the “why children arent required” statement... children arent eligible to get the vaccine because it hasnt been fully FDA approved yet.
7418,Thats the issue at hand.

7445,You’re not cool or a badass rebel because you fought against closures.
7446,mRNA is very fragile and is gone within a day or two of vaccination.

7448,You mount an immune response and what you are left with is immune memory.
7449,The long term effects of a immune response has been the subject of thousands of scientific studies over decades.
7450,There is nothing new here.
7451,There is no such thing as a side effect of vaccine that starts years later.

7456,Yes but the UK had 80% when a massive new wave hit.

7460,Early on when they were letting people in it was being handled rather well.
7461,"But the problem became they quickly looked at the sea of people needing to get in, the limited entrances and how much longer it would take and basically sped up the line."
7462,If anything it's an example that you need way more entrances and checkpoints if you are going to be verifying vaccinations and negative test results.
7463,"Vegas has been pretty intense about it ironically, given Nevada is pretty anti mask/vax."
7464,Almost all large events I've attended have a whole separate line for verifying vax status (atleast one dose) prior to entry and now some conventions are requiring proof of both doses.
7465,Fully support it but damn if there aren't tons of folks that will talk your ear off about how un-american it is.

7470,"&gt;	Also, there are many vaccinations that children are required to get before attending public school."
7471,This will be one once clinical trials are completed and it’s approved by the FDA.
7472,"So, why not just wait"
7473,That's a bit misleading.
7474,"While average age of admission has indeed gone down, about 61% of daily hospital admissions are still 50+ in Florida."
7475,Below is a table based on the [CDC admission rate data](https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#new-hospital-admissions) for Florida.

7527,Don't forget there are some people that have been recommended to not get the vaccine due to allergies or other conditions.

7557,I'd also say a lot of Public Health bodies in jurisdictions which have better isolated themselves from the pandemic tend to be both overconfident about the long term situation of the pandemic (or more willing to continue strict border restrictions) and more weary about going against the intervals which the vaccines were initially approved for.

A Coronavirus Epidemic Hit 20,000 Years Ago, New Study Finds

A few dozen human genes rapidly evolved in ancient East Asia to thwart coronavirus infections, scientists say."
7564,Those genes could be crucial to today’s pandemic.
7565,"By Carl Zimmer
Published June 24, 2021Updated June 28, 2021

Researchers have found evidence that a coronavirus epidemic swept East Asia some 20,000 years ago and was devastating enough to leave an evolutionary imprint on the DNA of people alive today."
7566,"Sign up for Science Times  Get stories that capture the wonders of nature, the cosmos and the human body."
7567,Get it sent to your inbox.
7568,"The new study suggests that an ancient coronavirus plagued the region for many years, researchers say."
7569,The finding could have dire implications for the Covid-19 pandemic if it’s not brought under control soon through vaccination.
7570,"“It should make us worry,” said David Enard, an evolutionary biologist at the University of Arizona who led the study, which was published on Thursday in the journal Current Biology."
7571,"“What is going on right now might be going on for generations and generations.”

Until now, researchers could not look back very far into the history of this family of pathogens."
7572,"Over the past 20 years, three coronaviruses have adapted to infect humans and cause severe respiratory disease: Covid-19, SARS and MERS."
7573,Studies on each of these coronaviruses indicate that they jumped into our species from bats or other mammals.
7574,"Four other coronaviruses can also infect people, but they usually cause only mild colds."
7575,"Scientists did not directly observe these coronaviruses becoming human pathogens, so they have relied on indirect clues to estimate when the jumps happened."
7576,"Coronaviruses gain new mutations at a roughly regular rate, and so comparing their genetic variation makes it possible to determine when they diverged from a common ancestor."
7577,"The most recent of these mild coronaviruses, called HCoV-HKU1, crossed the species barrier in the 1950s."
7578,"The oldest, called HCoV-NL63, may date back as far as 820 years."
7579,"But before that point, the coronavirus trail went cold — until Dr. Enard and his colleagues applied a new method to the search."
7580,"Instead of looking at the genes of the coronaviruses, the researchers looked at the effects on the DNA of their human hosts."
7581,"Over generations, viruses drive enormous amounts of change in the human genome."
7582,"A mutation that protects against a viral infection may well mean the difference between life and death, and it will be passed down to offspring."
7583,"A lifesaving mutation, for example, might allow people to chop apart a virus’s proteins."
7584,"But viruses can evolve, too."
7585,Their proteins can change shape to overcome a host’s defenses.
7586,"And those changes might spur the host to evolve even more counteroffensives, leading to more mutations."
7587,"When a random new mutation happens to provide resistance to a virus, it can swiftly become more common from one generation to the next."
7588,"And other versions of that gene, in turn, become rarer."
7589,"So if one version of a gene dominates all others in large groups of people, scientists know that is most likely a signature of rapid evolution in the past."
7590,"In recent years, Dr. Enard and his colleagues have searched the human genome for these patterns of genetic variation in order to reconstruct the history of an array of viruses."
7591,"When the pandemic struck, he wondered whether ancient coronaviruses had left a distinctive mark of their own."
7592,"He and his colleagues compared the DNA of thousands of people across 26 different populations around the world, looking at a combination of genes known to be crucial for coronaviruses but not other kinds of pathogens."
7593,"In East Asian populations, the scientists found that 42 of these genes had a dominant version."
7594,That was a strong signal that people in East Asia had adapted to an ancient coronavirus.
7595,But whatever happened in East Asia seemed to have been limited to that region.
7596,"“When we compared them to populations around the world, we couldn’t find the signal,” said Yassine Souilmi, a postdoctoral researcher at the University of Adelaide in Australia and a co-author of the new study."
7597,The scientists then tried to estimate how long ago East Asians had adapted to a coronavirus.
7598,"They took advantage of the fact that once a dominant version of a gene starts being passed down through the generations, it can gain harmless random mutations."
7599,"As more time passes, more of those mutations accumulate."
7600,Dr. Enard and his colleagues found that the 42 genes all had about the same number of mutations.
7601,That meant that they had all rapidly evolved at about the same time.
7602,"“This is a signal we should absolutely not expect by chance,” Dr. Enard said."
7603,"They estimated that all of those genes evolved their antiviral mutations sometime between 20,000 and 25,000 years ago, most likely over the course of a few centuries."
7604,"It’s a surprising finding, since East Asians at the time were not living in dense communities but instead formed small bands of hunter-gatherers."
7605,"Aida Andres, an evolutionary geneticist at University College London who was not involved in the new study, said she found the work compelling."
7606,"“I’m quite convinced there’s something there,” she said."
7607,"Still, she didn’t think it was possible yet to make a firm estimate of how long ago the ancient epidemic took place."
7608,"“The timing is a complicated thing,” she said."
7609,"“Whether that happened a few thousand years before or after — I personally think it’s something that we cannot be as confident of.”

Scientists looking for drugs to fight the new coronavirus might want to scrutinize the 42 genes that evolved in response to the ancient epidemic, Dr. Souilmi said."
7610,"“It’s actually pointing us to molecular knobs to adjust the immune response to the virus,” he said."
7611,"Dr. Anders agreed, saying that the genes identified in the new study should get special attention as targets for drugs."
7612,"“You know that they’re important,” she said."
7613,“That’s the nice thing about evolution.”
7614,"It's a problem, Thailand study shows the antibody lasts 3 months and update in Indonesia 600 doctors dead, but  also include more than 500 nurses, 300 midwives, and hundreds of dentists, pharmacists and other health workers, according to an independent data collection site Lapor COVID-19."
7615,Almost all were fully vaccinated with Sinovac.
7616,Sounds like you need different set of friends and distance yourself from certain family members.
7617,Idk why people are so shocked when they find out their families or friends are antivax or closeted racists like there were no warning signs before.

7633,"Blah blah blah anti-vax:
&gt; If it looks like half the population is having a shockingly different reaction to these jabs than was expected — it’s probably because their life experiences have actually been shockingly different, and their reasons range from a conscientious risk/benefit analysis, to the financial inability to take time off work/lack of health care in the event of potential side-effects, to an understandable distrust in a system that has never prioritized the health or well-being of their communities."

7652,"It works right now, but it might force them to live like that forever."
7653,Their vaccine is less effective than the other ones also.
7654,"The day they open a little bit more, they are screwed."
7655,I believe what UK did is the right approach right now.
7656,USA were good but they lifted too many restrictions early.
7657,Canada we wait until we get 75% fully vaxxed before lifting the remaining restrictions so I think we will have a similar approach like the UK after.
7658,Zero Covid is just impossible and require a tremendous amount of ressources just to delay the problem.
7659,"At this rate, cases will double again by next week and people will start to die after one or two weeks in the hospital."
7660,It's going to be really ugly.
7661,"The early indicators are showing vaccination are increasing in the 5 states that have been hit hardest by COVID where they have low vaccination rates (Louisiana, Missouri etc)."
7662,"I'm not judging these people, quite frankly it is a tragedy that very likely could not be avoided."
7663,I'd also point out that the media and politicians on both sides of the aisle own this.
7664,In late summer 2020 there was a steady number of articles with democrat leaders planting seeds of doubt over the vaccine by implying Trump would pressure medical professionals to accelerate the release of the vaccine even if it was not safe.
7665,Kamala Harris was leading that charge.
7666,The viewpoints on the safety of the vaccine was used by both political parties for political points based on presidential politics.
7667,They're reviewing the data already.
7668,Generally most drugs don't get EUA and can take years for full approval (read: have to wait their turn).
7669,But obviously this has priority.
7670,I wouldn't be surprised if its a couple months at most.
7671,[removed]
7672,"Yes I am clear about that, I particularly have two doses of Pfizer and I continue to take care of myself."
7673,But I thought vaccine  would help lower the contagion numbers.
7674,But I was shocked to see the graphic from Iceland so many people vaccinated and yet contagions like a year ago at the worst times.

Why Iceland  have so many People vaccinated (87% population have two doses)  and in the last month the cases have skyrocketed like a year ago?"
7750,Here's an odd one: has anybody else that has had covid noticed that when they get bug bites they have become a lot larger and last a lot longer than prior to having covid?
7751,But his doctor is concerned causing him to be concerned.
7752,You probably find a some people who haven't vaccinated NEED to do the song and dance because people immediately assume they're lying and attack them.

7777,&gt;The point of vaccines is so we can live life again.
7778,I think this is kind of obsolete thinking at this point.
7779,"This was indeed the message that we have been getting for the last several months from leaders and public health authorities, but they are now starting to walk this back in view of what's happening with the Delta variant, and other variants that seem to be on the horizon."
7780,Sorry to be the bearer of bad news.
7781,"I don't know that wearing a mask and taking other simple precautions equals ""not living life""; this seems a bit melodramatic to me though it's a very common formulation on this sub."
7782,It's a goal that was meant to have been met in June and could've been even earlier if people were more willing.
7783,It doesn't make that much of a difference since herd immunity is probably around 80-90% of the total population.
7784,What a monster
7785,"Ok, so you are saying there are three categories?"
7786,"Asymptomatic, suspected and confirmed and each daily briefing says the new number of each category and all transfers between the various categories (so that would be something like 3 numbers and 3 or 4 transfer numbers)."

7837,We will have a problem with our young kids that are covid babies because those that are responsibly kept home are not getting colds and other illnesses to strengthen their immune system.
7838,"As a parent of a 2.5 year old, who has only had one cold since birth, Im concerned."
7839,Oh they were required to show something?
7840,Plus it’s outside??
7841,Yeah this is a whole bunch of press for nothing
7842,"If they all were truly negative or vaccinated, this would be a good test for vaccines."

7844,My bet is on he either gets an Alzheimer's diagnosis or a charge for money laundering before 2024.

7849,"&gt;Some people have legitimate reasons they should not be vaccinated

Yeah, immune compromised people, like cancer patients or transplant receipients (the same people who rely on everone else to get vaccinated)."
7850,He isnt either either of those.
7851,"From his other statements, he seems to be at least halfway to an antivaxxer."
7852,&gt;There are countless folks (like me) for whom these shots carry a greater risk than the virus.
7853,Most of us don’t publicly share a private decision we made in careful consideration with our doctors.
7854,We know it’s not an easy conversation to unfold.
7855,"If it looks like half the population is having a shockingly different reaction to these jabs than was expected — it’s probably because their life experiences have actually been shockingly different, and their reasons range from a conscientious risk/benefit analysis, to the financial inability to take time off work/lack of health care in the event of potential side-effects, to an understandable distrust in a system that has never prioritized the health or well-being of their communities."
7856,That would be physically impossible.
7857,100 and 0 are the absolutes.
7858,"Even Measles, with an R0 as high as 17, has a herd immunity threshold under 100%."
7859,"100 is as high as you can go, just like 0 is the lowest you can go."
7860,"If HI threshold is 100, it means every single person will get infected or vaccinated."
7861,"Basically once you get to HI threshold of 99%, all increases in R0 will Basically move HI threshold you would just keep adding another order of magnitude."
7862,"You'd go from 99% to 99.1, 99.2, etc."
7863,"Then if you hit 99.9%, it would go to 99.91, 99.92."
7864,There is an infinite amount that you can keep doing that with before you reach 100.
7865,I would call tripling a surge
7866,Lmao literally no mention of any confirmation of asymptotic spread in kids at all.
7867,You gotta be kidding me!
7868,How can one tell who a migrant is while carrying covid in a car?
7869,"What does ""migrant covid carrier"" mean here?"
7870,Seems rather racist.
7871,Just like no one gives a shit how whiny you are about vaccine mandates.
7872,Stay home.
7873,It already isn’t a false scare in many locations.
7874,"Iceland, Israel, and the US have been forced to reimpose restrictions, and right now Louisiana just hit an all time high for hospital bed use."
7875,Shit like this is why I believe hospitals should turn away people who refused the vaccine.
7876,They shouldn’t take up hospital beds.
7877,[removed]
7878,This also implies that there is nothing we can feasibly do to end COVID.
7879,It’s endemic and will be around long after we are gone.
7880,"But yes, it is significantly less dangerous than H1N1 for children."
7881,It just spreads faster.
7882,God I hate this guy

7884,If that's the case might as well all go die off now
7885,[removed]
7886,A lot of people apparently think there's zero risk after being vaccinated unfortunately.
7887,Which obviously is not true.
7888,So they drop most mitigation practices and return to pre-pandemic life.
7889,I get it.
7890,"It's liberating as hell, but you're at some risk, albeit low."
7891,"If you go out and expose yourself to large crowds or confined spaces for a prolonged period of time, you're gonna get blasted with a ton of virus if someone in there is positive."
7892,"With Delta, it's the viral dose and apparently, a much stickier spike protein."
7893,"Hell, the more people that get vaxxed, the more so-called breakthroughs will be reported."

7905,"Children was a group did seem to have some protection from the original virus and maybe Alpha, but the youngest children were always at higher risk than school age children."
7906,"The early data from China said:

&gt; However, we found that the proportion of severe and critical cases was 10.6%, 7.3%, 4.2%, 4.1%, and 3.0% for the age groups &lt;1, 1 to 5, 6 to 10, 11 to 15, and &gt;15 years, respectively."

7910,"An perhaps after a year of largely staying home and other precautions, they’ve stopped being exposed regularly to various cold bugs and that has blunted their innate immunity."
7911,If you actually read the article you'd see that he actually does talk about different reasons other than medical ones.
7912,I hope every single one of them gets COVID and then has all the additional complications
7913,"&gt; A positive test would put someone either in the ""confirmed case"" or ""symptomatic infection"" category, so it would definitely be reported."
7914,Not according to the criteria you linked.
7915,"The document used ""confirmed"" and ""suspected""."
7916,Maybe you are saying there are even more additional categories that are used?
7917,"&gt; In the end, China's reported numbers are almost certainly much closer to the true numbers than those reported by most countries - simply because China tests more extensively."
7918,"It depends on what you mean by ""true numbers""."
7919,For any other country catching COVID and not having symptoms is considered a case of COVID.
7920,"For the PRC catching COVID and not having symptoms is not considered a case of COVID, so the numbers mean different things."
7921,"Also (if I understand it correctly) according to what you sent me to have ""symptoms"" (enough to be considered a PRC suspected case) you would need to have a positive X-ray or blood test (not just a positive PCR test) in addition to normal symptoms like a fever."
7922,"I didn't see anything discussion of ""symptomatic"" in the document you sent."
7923,"Though the criteria seem to make it much harder to be considered ""suspected"" or ""confirmed"" than it would be to be considered symptomatic in other countries."

8033,"They don’t even say anything about the vaccine in their discussion of the implications of the study on public health:

&gt; Jurisdictions might consider expanded prevention strategies, including universal masking in indoor public settings, particularly for large public gatherings that include travelers from many areas with differing levels of SARS-CoV-2 transmission."
8034,"They are primarily using the event to discuss the likely benefits of masking at large events taking place in indoor areas with significant amounts of travelers, especially if they come from COVID hot spots."

8152,"Second, yeah it’s a drop in the bucket."
8153,"Every time I save a half-gallon of water (I live in parched CA) or a gallon of gas or any other environmental good deed, I think “so what, the corporations undo this a thousand times a minute”."
8154,But it’s what *I* can do.
8155,"I can’t become a CEO and change corporate policy, all my little letters to congressmen are probably unread - but I can do my tiny part to not make the problem worse."
8156,"My dad died of Covid, and along with being sad, I shrugged my shoulders - because he didn’t believe in masks and went out to eat etc."
8157,"Live by the sword, die by the sword."
8158,"But my mom has spent over a year in her house, wears masks faithfully when needed, and does every little thing she can to reduce her risks."
8159,"So I’ll keep wearing my mask not just for me, but for her and all the people like her."

8162,Anyone’s guess.
8163,"Mine is that In the US, fall will likely see a sharp decline in cases after we get through this delta surge."
8164,"Depends on the local transmission level, her health, the health of people she's around, and your level of risk tolerance."
8165,This is actually kind of sad.
8166,"According to Pete, he actually does have a medical reason not to get the vaccine (Gillian-Barre Syndrome, a peripheral neuropathy/demyelination autoimmune reaction some people can have to some vaccinations)."
8167,Apparently the J&amp;J vaccine has about 100 cases out of 12.5 million doses administered ([source](https://www.fda.gov/news-events/press-announcements/coronavirus-covid-19-update-july-13-2021)).
8168,"It’s a ridiculously low incidence, but he’s a person at some increased baseline risk."
8169,This is the type of person herd immunity is meant to protect.
8170,It’s unfortunate he was put in this situation by the hordes of selfish idiots allowing this pandemic to rage on.
8171,"Honestly though with the numbers if I was in his place I’d probably still get it, but I guess his doctor knows him better than I do and has seen his GBS reaction first hand."

8189,Yikes
8190,"The internal CDC document stated that the risk of severe COVID for the vaccinated is 1/25th the risk of severe covid for the unvaccinated, all else being equal."
8191,That's an efficacy in  he high 90%'s.
8192,"With that, if cases go up by more than 25X what they were (as has happened over the last few months), then the vaccinated are actually at higher risk for severe COVID now than  he unvaccinated were a few months ago, all else being equal."

8213,But every little bit helps when it comes to kids especially
8214,I tried to get tickets to zootopia but they were all sold out man.
8215,Demographics.
8216,"Most of their cases over the past year have been from returning chinese citizens, generally younger healthier individuals."
8217,Not cases running rampant through retirement homes.
8218,Maybe.
8219,That's cool unless you have children or are a child.
8220,You know minorities have very low rates right?
8221,"3,582 people out of 10 million."
8222,Thays .0035% of the population of LA county.
8223,"So yeah, its pretty easy to not know a vaccinated person who tested positive."
8224,Wondering this too.
8225,"With how determined we are to go backwards, it’s starting to feel like never."
8226,Yes but wasn't the question how could they rigorously vet their religious sincerity?
8227,I have been asking if anyone has heard anything about medical exemptions and the posts are immediately removed.
8228,You two are talking about different things.
8229,"Them: the vaccinated are at higher risk with more spread around them than they were with less spread around them

You: the vaccinated are at lower risk than the unvaccinated."
8230,Both of those things are true.
8231,"Look at all the baseball games, festivals, other outdoor concerts, etc."
8232,I don’t get why this particular one upsets so many people when they’re required to get vaccinated anyway.
8233,You’re on an American website.

8235,There was no herd immunity for smallpox.
8236,It was the vaccine that wiped it out.
8237,Pretty sure same with polio.
8238,"""50% of Ameirca is vaccinated"" ......is that statement at least 1 shot or both (the whole series for those vaccines that require 2 doses i.e."
8239,Fully Vaccinated)?

8244,"We don’t have data yet, but we do know viral load is far higher and preliminary studies show greater infection rates."
8245,"If nothing else, they are a force to not be fucked with."
8246,I understand that data isn't as robust for J&amp;J but the lack of reporting on this is extremely frustrating.
8247,I saw an NPR article a few weeks ago saying J&amp;J was effective but then completely conflicting articles saying it's not really effective.
8248,"I don't get this logic 

If the FDA approves it this month, then it's suddenly needed."
8249,But the day/week/month before it wasn't...?
8250,"In a world where other, equally reputable, non-US agencies have approved and are recommending a 3rd dose, having a blindly US-centric perspective doesn't help anyone"
8251,It's a matter of the r number.
8252,If infected people are on average infecting half the people as before then it reduces the r by half.
8253,What makes you think that?
8254,I keep seeing poeple say it.
8255,"Delta is basically a wildfire and the unvaccinated are kindling at this point, it's going to burn through the schools quickly ."
8256,I have 2 kids under 12 and a wife who is a teacher.
8257,I told her 2 weeks ago to expect that all 4 of us will most likely be infected within the next 2 months.
8258,It seems inevitable at this point.
8259,Wife and I are fully vaxxed but its not going to matter as the amount of exposures my wife and kids will be exposed to in classrooms for 8 hours a day.
8260,My two hopes.
8261,1.
8262,"Our school districts go virtual the first 4 weeks of school(i doubt this will happen though)
2."
8263,Statistically all 4 of us should either by asymptomatic or mild infections still doesn't give me much assurance though.
8264,"
&gt; You say that 3.7k were symptomatic

No i didn't

I said : ""Out of 7k only 3.7k had symptoms **long enough to log**""


You literally didn't read the study because you're too dumb to understand it (even though they literally included a flow chart)"
8265,I completely agree.
8266,[deleted]
8267,"Well, we could try to protect ourselves AND other people"
8268,"which is a real stress test given that to my understanding, people previously infected who then got vaccinated had were expected to have even better protection than vaccination or earlier infection alone."
8269,"Lol, ass gasket."
8270,I understand now.
8271,Never understood the point of that.
8272,It's like tissue paper and not stopping anything I'm afraid of my ass touching.
8273,Seems like a wierd waste of paper...
8274,18 USC 1001 is a kinda catch-all statute for any false statements related to the federal government.
8275,Faking a CDC card would likely fall under it.
8276,"If they faked a CVS proof of vaccination document there might be some kind of state-level fraud statutes that it violates, but they wouldn't fall under the federal crime."
8277,Well i did IVIG 1st but about 3 weeks later my doctor determined that didn’t work so then I did plasmapherisis which was what finally stopped my white blood cells from attacking my nervous system then it was intense physical and occupational therapy.
8278,It was about a year before I could get back to most of the things I used to do and about 3 years to get to how I feel today  - hang in there and hoping you can find some relief soon
8279,Isn't there some sort of relevant licensing body here?
8280,"If people had been told that mask mandates would be lifted once vaccinations rates were 70%+, a lot of people would have been more willing to comply."
8281,It's the CDC fault for enacting and then reenacting mandates so quickly.
8282,Thank you!
8283,"I keep trying to remind myself of that, but it's stressful for sure."
8284,You are not selfish.
8285,I'm angry for my elementary children and I work at a high school and am angry for what they've had to deal with and what some of them are in for going to college.
8286,It's beyond unfair that this is the third school year to be affected.
8287,I'm so ready for this to be done.
8288,It seems like it will never end.
8289,Maybe Governor DeSantis will help.

8291,"Of course, it might only take a few months when a powerful new variant comes and we need a whole new vaccine."
8292,"If they were to approve it without going through their normal process, because to a layperson it seems like an inevitability anyway, that would seriously undermine their credibility and the public's trust in the agency."
8293,"Plus, if they *were* to find some strange safety issue that was serious enough to warrant a rejection, wouldn't we want to know so we can stop using the vaccine, not give people boosters, etc.?"
8294,"It would be a giant cluster fuck, but pretending the issue doesn't exist wouldn't be the right move."
8295,Those statistics are relevant to the discussion.
8296,It simply does not matter if the virus mutates to become less deadly or if it is due to vaccines - the current lethality is arbitrary because it is lower than common flu due to the vaccines.
8297,"If vaccinated people start dying with regularity, then it makes sense to discuss again."
8298,"It's like if I was getting into the ocean, and I was worried about dying in a rip current because 10 people last week died in a rip current."
8299,"Seems reasonable, so I ask the lifeguard about rip currents, and he says there's no rip currents today, so you're safe."
8300,"This answer isn't good enough for me, so my friend and I continue to discuss the potential chance of death in a rip current in the ocean today."
8301,"The appropriate thing to do is not worry about rip currents today, but I should continue to ask the lifeguard if there are rip currents if I go back to the beach tomorrow or the next day."
8302,"Sure, but he was requiring proof of vaccination and the party was outdoors so he is following the CDC health guidelines."
8303,He is doing what we all need to do for the public good.
8304,How is development paused?
8305,I have to throw them into a room with 29 other developmentally challenged kids?
8306,"So long as they’re having interactions with other humans, it’s probably going to be fine."
8307,Just because they don’t attend in-person school school unmasked doesn’t mean they won’t interact with other people.
8308,[removed]
8309,most of us kind of accept that we can go broke due to health care costs anyway
8310,"Might be a dumb question, but is it okay to take xanax after receiving the mRNA vaccine?"
8311,Will it reduce the effects?
8312,[removed]
8313,The way he can help the people who need it is by getting the damn vaccine to reduce the amount of virus in circulation.
8314,Fake virtuous people can annoy me even more than plain old selfish people sometimes.
8315,I’ll keep trying!
8316,Just hope I don’t get delta’d anyway because not enough other people are
8317,SF just announced J&amp;J people can get an mRNA dose.
8318,I know thats 1 city and most likely doesnt help you unless you are there but maybe that is coming down soon
8319,What do you do to combat maskne?
8320,I've heard that using mouthwash right before wearing helps because it kills a lot of the bacteria that would otherwise become trapped against your face.
8321,"I haven't had to wear a mask for a long enough period after learning that to see if it really helps, though."
8322,I try to keep my trips to places with people short as possible.
8323,GA parent here.
8324,This is what I thought too.
8325,Our local public schools have decided masks are optional.
8326,All other measures have been dropped entirely.
8327,"BUT, they're still tracking cases and quarantining close contacts."
8328,"I'm angry, but also genuinely baffled."
8329,What series of thoughts possibly led them to this set of policies?
8330,Let's maximize conditions for the fastest spread we can and also shut everything down whenever we find cases.
8331,Fun fact: the school down the street from my house sent its first contact risk email BEFORE the official first day of school.
8332,"Apparently a bunch of families attended the open house, found out they had COVID, and then informed the school."
8333,Thank you for clearing that up!

8338,"There’s a lot here that requires debunking, but I only have a few minutes."
8339,"First, Israel is better at finding breakthrough infections because they’re actually looking for them."
8340,It’s only within the last week that the US stopped discouraging doctors from administering COVID tests to people who are vaccinated.
8341,That means we were intentionally flying blind on breakthrough infections.
8342,"Other countries are realizing that something is wrong, so they’re starting to do more testing for delta breakthroughs, and they’re finding a lot of them."
8343,"And while death has become a lot less common, long COVID is still happening in 20% of the vaccinated."
8344,That’s worse than your odds when playing Russian roulette.
8345,Then there’s organ damage and blood clotting issues.
8346,We need more studies on them.
8347,You do *not* want to get COVID even if you’re vaccinated.
8348,It’s far too plausible that you’re going to end up with severe health problems in the next couple of decades.
8349,"We needed to irradiate COVID at the start of this whole mess, back when very few people had it."
8350,"But big business prioritized short term profits, so they pushed governments to get things reopened as quickly as possible."
8351,"There is corruption, and we are being manipulated, but not in the way that many people seem to think."
8352,"Begone, troll."
8353,No he’s politically smart and knows his base.
8354,In the name of “freedom” his base will eat anything up
8355,"I think he's mad because he had to think about other people :""( poor baby"
8356,Will I?
8357,"Nope, never have."
8358,Will the millions upon millions who dont use reddit and will never see this comment?
8359,Absolutely.

8368,If that's the case then why is it taking forever for U 12 to be approved to get the vaccine?
8369,I have never heard the UK be referred to as 'the kingdom' before but ngl it sounds pretty cool.
8370,They never did it in Florida.
8371,Some public restrooms have paper toilet seat covers you put over the seat when you sit down.
8372,They are flushable I believe.
8373,"My friend calls them ""ass gaskets"""
8374,If there's an actual mask mandate and nearly everyone is wearing them then the cloth and surgical masks are effective at reducing the amount of the virus getting expelled into the room.
8375,They just offer only minimal protection to the wearer when breathing in.
8376,So in an environment where many others aren't wearing masks then it's best to wear a respirator that provides filtration.
8377,However even to this day the CDC explicitly recommends against N95s (claiming that it's necessary that they be reserved for medical staff) and they refuse to endorse foreign masks like KN95s.
8378,[removed]
8379,[removed]
8380,Hence why I was confused.
8381,Vermont shouldn’t have red/orange/brown counties.
8382,(Except Essex.)
8383,"Which may or may not do you much good in the long run, depending on the specifics of whatever variant emerges next."
8384,It's unclear if it evades immunity or just replicates so fast that the immune response isn't sufficient.
8385,"I guess that's semantic, but spike can only replicate so much and still be able to bind to its epitope."
8386,"As other replies mention, we *did* live with those viruses."
8387,"Additionally, COVID-19 is not polio, smallpox, or other similar horrible diseases."
8388,"Look, it’s bad, but we are already seeing mortality being reduced substantially."
8389,"The US has about 20-60k influenza deaths each year, and that’s with vaccines and treatment."
8390,"Not trying to be one of those crazy people who try to call COVID like the flu, but my point is that we’ve been living with influence and tens of thousands of mortalities from it annually for as long as all of us have been alive."
8391,"We will not eliminate COVID, but I suspect between vaccinations, treatments and lingering immunity from those infected (notably lasting B and T cell responses), this virus is going to be less severe as time moves on."
8392,That's great and all but what about those of us who got the J&amp;J vaccine?
8393,I've been really worried about its efficacy with Delta but also haven't wanted to just get a Pfizer or Moderna jab without professional guidance.
8394,I remember how idealistic we all were about the utopian promise of the free flow of information.
8395,Those were the days.
8396,Tennessee here too.
8397,I can’t tell you how jealous I am of this Illinois school mask mandate.
8398,My daughter started school yesterday.
8399,She was the only one wearing a mask.
8400,&gt; you're pointing to specific actions of one country to try to explain why an entire region has performed better.
8401,I'm pointing to specific actions to illustrate the large cultural differences between East Asia and the West.
8402,"Countries in East Asia didn't all follow the same exact policies, but they share broad common cultural characteristics that make organizing an effective societal response and getting widespread compliance possible."
8403,Do people isolate when asked to do so?
8404,How careful are people in their everyday lives?
8405,"When the government says not to leave your apartment, do you comply?"
8406,"Are leaders willing to mobilize a large, organized effort (to test, to distribute food, etc."
8407,"), and will they population participate?"
8408,Do people mind being tracked for public health purposes?
8409,"&gt; I would love to hear a perspective on what Peru could possibly do to beat back the virus, which you say is entirely doable."
8410,I said that it's entirely doable in Europe and the US.
8411,"In much poorer societies, it's much more difficult to take the necessary measures, and to get effective compliance with those measures."
8412,"&gt; This is not known, and is currently unknowable."
8413,"Not only is it possible, it was done years before the pandemic: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6178078/."
8414,The widespread exposure you're hypothesizing simply had not occurred.
8415,Ya but both can be true.
8416,Vaccine could still make it less likely to get infected but when infected you are just as contagious as anyone.
8417,"It’s like if you said when a bullet penetrates a bullet proof vest, the person bleeds as much as someone without a bullet proof vest."
8418,Doesn’t mean bullet proof vests don’t work some of the time.

8421,"Close your eyes, it goes away."
8422,Plus from what I’ve seen there isn’t likely to be a vaccine evading variant.
8423,MRNA vaccines are pretty good at their job.
8424,Romania isn't giving up in vaccinating its people.
8425,The population just can't be bothered to get the vaccine.
8426,"Anyone that wants it can get it right away, but doses are being given to other countries so that they don't expire unused."
8427,“you believe actual statistics”?
8428,"Lmfaooo

You have nothing."
8429,Literally nothing.

8439,Exactly.
8440,The UK has gone through their Delta wave and from a partially vaccinated population you can calculate how severe the Delta variant is.
8441,There are other things at play but it seems rather clear to me.
8442,"&gt; The Lambda variant of the coronavirus, first identified in Peru and now spreading in South America, is highly infectious and more resistant to vaccines than the original version of the virus the emerged from Wuhan, China, Japanese researchers have found."
8443,"In laboratory experiments, they found that three mutations in Lambda's spike protein, known as RSYLTPGD246-253N, 260 L452Q and F490S, help it resist neutralization by vaccine-induced antibodies."
8444,"Two additional mutations, T76I and L452Q, help make Lambda highly infectious, they found."

8455,Obviously it’s a broad strokes convo we’re having.
8456,It’s not like the US would have to do it alone.
8457,It’s also not like we couldn’t reduce some of our other military spending and spend it on biodefense (ie vaccines).

8697,This has nothing to do with statistical significance.
8698,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26186114/
8699,There is never been a vaccine in the history of vaccines that has shown any long term side affects outside of a 2 month window.
8700,So considering that we’ve vaccinated 100’s of millions of people over a period longer then 2 months your rational for waiting for more time on side effects doesn’t sync up with any scientific or medical research that has happened up to this point in humanities history.
8701,Your risk calculation is just woefully off base.
8702,Further more all of these people still catching covid are giving the disease ample time and opportunity to continue to mutate and potentially mutate into a strain that can better evade the vaccinations and then we are in an even worse position then we were at the start of this whole thing.
8703,This appears to be all driven by the unvaccinated in this country and others where vaccines are readily available because said unvaccinated think they are smarter or more researched than people who do this for a living.

8789,[Survey](https://www.kff.org/coronavirus-covid-19/dashboard/kff-covid-19-vaccine-monitor-dashboard/) from kaiser which is partnered from politifact.
8790,14% of blues and 58% of reds never want a vaccine.
8791,It certainly skews that reds are more detrimental but they're not alone.
8792,And some reds are getting vaccinated.
8793,The strangest divide seems to be having health insurance or not.
8794,People with insurance seem to care much less about the vaccine.
8795,They'll move the goalposts to demand people live their entire lives with the vaccine first.

&gt;Among the 188 reported pediatric flu deaths:  
43% (81) occurred in children younger than 5 years old  
12 occurred in children younger than 6 months and thus too young to get a flu vaccine  
57% (107) deaths occurred in children 5-17 years old  
Of the 175 pediatric deaths among children with known information on medical conditions, 76 (43.4%) had a pre-existing medical condition."
8810,Nearly two-thirds of the deaths were attributed to influenza B infections.
8811,2019-2020 is the highest recorded deaths on record (It became a must report in 2004)

8831,Nah son gimme that loud ventilator.
8832,"Yeah, I recommend taking a break from doomsday messaging."
8833,Even the SAGE report out of the UK last week stated that it was *equally as likely* that Covid mutated to be less virulent (on par with the common colds).
8834,And the statement that we can’t live with friends Covid without mitigations is totally absurd and ignores all past pandemics and the long history of humans and viruses.
8835,That could be selection bias since most vaccinated people you know probably got Pfizer to begin with

8839,Muiuurrrrrrfyxkingcuh!
8840,I agree with you.
8841,Whatever saves the most lives should be the goal for every party involved.
8842,The other way around would work better; they are required to go to a hospital to get checked on.
8843,They can quarantine at home when a doctor determines it is safe for them to do so.
8844,This could also be done remotely for less-severe cases.
8845,"Zoom call to doctor, talk about symptoms and state, doctor determines it is ok to stay home."
8846,Artificially limiting who is eligible to go to hospitals prevents people from getting a check-up when they need it most.
8847,It varies for everyone but I was just sort of tired with 99+ temp (not even technically a fever) for half a day after each dose.
8848,It just gave me an excuse to relax and play Zelda.
8849,But it is a good paying job.

8857,"Not scientific, but LA County [reported](https://www.foxla.com/news/over-25-of-new-covid-19-cases-in-los-angeles-county-are-fully-vaccinated-people) that 0.27% of people with the J&amp;J vaccine tested positive, 0.15% with Pfizer, and 0.09% with Moderna."
8858,Some people even get chickenpox twice.
8859,"It's unusual, but not unknown."
8860,My daughter had chickenpox when she was two (pre-chickenpox vaccine) and only had 5 poxes on her whole body.
8861,The doctor confirmed chickenpox.
8862,At 15 she had it again!
8863,And a far worse case as it usually is in older kids or adults.
8864,"I couldn't believe that it was chicken pox despite the distinctive symptoms, but her doctor confirmed and said that while unusual (not rare), it was definitely not unknown, especially when the child had a mild case the first time."
8865,Her body simply didn't produce enough antibodies the first go-round to fight off the later exposure.
8866,The same thing can happen with other viruses like covid.
8867,"Not enough antibodies are produced the first time, or the antibodies reduce in number over time leading to the possibility of reinfection."
8868,The other thing that can happen as we're seeing now is that a new genetic variant of a disease (such as delta) may not be as susceptible to the antibodies produced either by an earlier infection or by vaccination.
8869,"A huge reason that having everyone vaccinated as quickly as possible is to prevent the long term prevalence of a disease in a population, with many more ""generations"" of that organism having more time and chances to mutate and evolve resistance to current vaccines."

8902,You should let them know that.
8903,"You aren't wrong, but your interpretation is incorrect."
8904,The current vaccine were effective against the original Sars-Covi-2 and Alpha.
8905,This was in the messaging about the vaccine and is true.
8906,The Delta variant is a much more infectious and has mutated to evade the current vaccines protections.
8907,"So, yes it was true that it would likely prevent infections for Alpha and earlier strains."
8908,"Now...it is true that the vaccine prevents hospitalizations against Delta which was always the point of vaccinations, to prevent hospitalization and death and in that it is doing a very good job, the best we've ever seen, ask anybody they'll tell you."
8909,You are SERIOUSLY underestimating the flu

8921,"I don’t think Adeno+mRNA has been shown to be superior to mRNA+mRNA, rather AZ+mRNA is better than AZ+AZ."
8922,I suspect much of the delta is because AZ doesn’t use the prefusion stabilized spike protein and the dosage schedule was too short resulting  in an immune response to the 2nd dose vector.

8950,Yeah.
8951,The flu.

8953,"&gt; Now that case numbers are so low

'Scuse me?"

Voting independent is what contributes to republican votes, you're right, there are indeed misinformation campaigns, well, that still means more republican voters with boots to the ballot, which is all the more reason why the above point remains valid..."
8955,Covid got politicized.
8956,"One side didn't care enough about the virus, and that caused a huge knee-jerk reaction from the other side, resulting in many of them taking the opposite extreme."
8957,The CDC gave in to political pressure.
8958,"Given how some people can get regarding their beliefs about Covid, I honestly wouldn't be surprised if it later came out that they were outright *threatened* into bringing back masks."

8960,Yes!!!
8961,Great decision parent!
8962,I’m not an expert but I don’t think viruses can just change their entire structure and still be the same virus
8963,"Not sure if directly related, but as someone with an autoimmune condition, bug bits are ridiculously large when I get them and feel like they take forever to leave."
8964,"It may be possible that post Covid, a person’s immune system isn’t as strong as prior to manage things like that just yet?"
8965,Good.
8966,That's weird.
8967,Drummers usually like needles.
8968,That's not what I'm saying.
8969,"I'm saying some states, or maybe it's just some facilities, don't require an ID and will still administer the vaccine if you refuse to fill out the personal identification form."

8978,This would work great on the homeless.
8979,With the average FDA approval taking 12 years I would say this is rushed.
8980,Probably nothing that we dont already know - but if the government isn't confident enough in the vaccine to approve it yet then maybe they shouldnt be confident enough to require everyone to get it
8981,"I find those comments to really brighten my day, in between taking in all the other news."
8982,It is so nice to see how encouraging people can be.
8983,The main vaccines being used in China right now have similar efficacy as J&amp;J and AstraZeneca.
8984,"They're not as effective as the mRNA vaccines (a very high standard to meet), but they're still highly effective at preventing serious disease and death."
8985,"&gt; Zero cases is impossible

It's possible for most of the country most of the time."
8986,"There are sporadic outbreaks, which are mostly localized and which have (so far) all been quelled within a few weeks."
8987,But most of the country has zero virus prevalence most of the time.
8988,They can already do this...
8989,True but public safety demands some transparency due to the high transmission rates of covid.
8990,They defined “exposure” in impossible to meet terms so they could avoid having to pay for teachers quarantining and notifying parents.
8991,It was shady as fuck and they hid behind hipaa.
8992,"Parents were voluntarily notifying the school that a kid had a positive test and no one would be told, not even the teacher unless the parent reached out directly to them."
8993,"If the teacher did hear directly from the parent, they couldn’t say anything to anyone else, not their team teachers or their other students parents."
8994,We had so many cases.
8995,An entire department of staff had covid one after the other and there was no official notification about exposure.
8996,9 adults who work in the same office all had covid within a three week period.
8997,Yet they didn’t consider any of them exposed to each other.
8998,"I had a coworker text me to tell me he had covid after we spent an afternoon working in the same space (masked) and had lunch six feet apart and when I reported it, was told that it wasn’t exposure, keep it to myself and keep serving my students as usual."
8999,(I’m a speech therapist.)
9000,"Basically they ignored the situation and we magically never had a single full class or admin office that were exposed and needed to quarantine, and let me tell you, many staff tried to keep safety measures in place as best as possible but kids and adults aren’t perfect so there was no way that all measures were followed perfectly in every single instance of possible exposure (obviously since an entire grade level would have a swathe of students and staff disappear for a few weeks then come back)."
9001,"Ok rant over, had to get that off my chest."
9002,TLDR: districts can and have ignored covid.
9003,It sucks for all involved.
9004,It is shady af
9005,"Yeah, you didn't need a survey to tell us that we already figured that out months ago."

9010,"Meanwhile, I ust read a story that said the reason vaccinated folks can spread the virus and get sick from the virus is that it prefers to multiply in the nose; that’s its main point of entry as well."
9011,And your antibodies don’t really detect it  there; they will react once it spreads to the lungs or into the throat.
9012,"So we should all say to the people with their noses hanging out, “Did you know the virus enters the body by the nose, and replicates there?"
9013,That’s why non mask wearers get so sick.”

9022,The general rule in life is typically simple - do what the white rich folks are doing and you will be better off.
9023,This is true for investing money as well as taking care of your health.
9024,And there are a few reasons to be skeptical in this data: the first is a very high 15% positivity rate implying that testing isn't finding all cases and that this R value is not accurate.
9025,"But also, it's still above 1."
9026,And it hasn't been dipping for a significant period of time yet.
9027,"That doesn't mean they can't be rounding a corner, it just means there's not enough data to say they are."
9028,We do expect a massive drop in infection when Delta has burned through most of the population and Missouri's getting closer to that point every day.
9029,Don't people get yearly flu shots?
9030,"The flu shot is much worse than dose 1 of Moderna for me (I felt bad the next day with a mild fever), and I get it every year."
9031,"It's basically a guaranteed 2 days of fever, exhaustion, and body aches, but it protects everyone around me (I work with babies and children.)"
9032,"I'm sure dose 2 is going to knock me down, but that's not even something I consider when getting preventative medical care."
9033,&gt; Our school system is mandating masks for all students and staff except for PE class and after asking the school board how they’re managing lunchtime considering how packed and maskless 130 6th grader will be - the lack of an answer means no one even thought about the cafeteria.
9034,"My school district basically did away with online schools (because the governor pulled funding for them) and banned mask mandates, so we're fully on our own."
9035,I would love to live somewhere that the school system at least can try to do something to protect kids.
9036,"As far as the vaccination statistics, I did some back of the napkin math and my zip code is around 58% fully vaccinated (not just counting eligible people, which is about 65% for the entire county not just my zip code) and if I include people who had their first doses to that number then we're about 79% at least partially vaccinated for the entire population."
9037,I have no idea what the age demographics are in terms of 0-11 vs 12-18 but I know that about 8% of people under 18 are fully vaccinated in my county.
9038,"That being said, I think we've done a pretty good job as a community inside of Texas with these numbers, but when school starts back up in a couple of weeks I expect a lot of kids are going to get sick and it's going to wreak havoc anyway since the kids are fully unprotected."
9039,"My kids will wear masks and they have my full permission to handle bullies however they feel necessary if people mess with them for wearing masks, but that's still not enough."
9040,A large portion of this sub is children.

9047,I'm speaking from experience.
9048,"Hey, if you can't or won't count, then everything is countless...."
9049,Zero CoVID is far better for the economy than any other strategy.
9050,"It requires short, intense periods of mobilization to quell outbreaks, but between outbreaks, there are long stretches of normalcy, in which people and businesses face basically no restrictions."
9051,"Additionally, most outbreaks are localized to one or a few cities, so most people in the country are unaffected by them."
9052,"Over the past year, CoVID-19 has placed a far smaller burden on Chinese society than it has on most countries, because it just hasn't been present."
9053,The main people impacted by the zero-CoVID strategy are people who want to travel internationally.
9054,You have to go through a 3-week quarantine and get repeatedly tested in order to get into China.
9055,"But if you stay in the country, it's almost as if CoVID-19 didn't exist."
9056,"Linking to a paywall for a local Dallas news source on a website that serves the world is the issue here, not journalists getting paid, or the paywall itself."
9057,No one from Chicago or London is signing up to Dallasnews.com just for this story.
9058,The fact that that this paywalled site then serves you a bunch of clickbait stories as you try to back out of the paywall is also just unethical.

9091,A [Family Matter](https://youtu.be/P0PFUGtKgDo) generally is more complex and nuanced than people really want acknowledge.
9092,"2022 rates are gonna go through the roof and then ""discounted"" back to 2021 rates with proof of vaccination."
9093,We can see how long the anti-vaxxers are willing to pay hundreds of more dollars per month just to keep being anti-vax.
9094,The almighty dollar will persuade these chuckle-fucks.
9095,I’d watch that concert…from the safety of my TV screen.
9096,"Do it right, like how Disney covered *Hamilton*, make it the best concert ever, and don’t repeat the super-spreader event that is Lollapalooza."
9097,[deleted]
9098,Congress needs to amend the Affordable Care Act to allow for higher premiums for the unvaccinated.
9099,I guess the Kids weren't alright....
9100,"https://abcnews.go.com/US/vast-majority-icu-patients-covid-19-unvaccinated-abc/story?id=79128401

Looks like everything I wrote was correct."
9101,Just because vaccinated people can still get it doesn’t mean they have any significant risk of death or serious illness.
9102,All Covid vaccines induce T cell responses.
9103,The Atlantic article could have been a Novovax press release.
9104,"And not one word about why it supposedly induces better T cell responses than existing vaccines, just a one word ”could” in a tweet from someone I never heard of."
9105,We’re the most advanced state in the nation.
9106,Surely the only one that has a database.
9107,These other states haven’t even heard of computers yet!
9108,"Good, now let's hope they enforce it better than concerts and other large events"
9109,[deleted]
9110,&gt;	But if you just saw me walking down the street at that point you’d probably say look at this jerk wearing his mask below his nose.
9111,Actually I do see people doing this and that part makes total sense to me.
9112,"I’m thinking more of people I see in crowded stores, etc."
9113,where you’d want the mask protection.
9114,The brain fog is what concerns me too.
9115,Fever and cough are more or less temporary...
9116,"If I can't taste or smell for a while, well that'd suck, but I think I could still survive."
9117,No thanks
9118,Huh?
9119,"There are still new vaccines being developed, including some intranasal ones."
9120,"Intranasal might be perfect for people in your situation, as they provide instant temporary immunity in the mucus membranes, preventing infection entirely."
9121,I hope something develops soon to better protect y'all.
9122,This post appears to be about vaccines.

9125,*
9126,No one knows how long the vaccine efficacy lasts for either?
9127,It’s the same boat for both types of immunity - why discriminate against one vs other
9128,"I haven’t heard any experts say approval would come in mid to late 2022, I believe the US estimate is application to FDA in the fall for EUA and approval expected at the end of 2021."
9129,"Sinopharm approved its vaccine for kids 3-17, recently, as well."
9130,Other countries plan to recommend to vaccinate children in contact with high risk populations or those who are high risk themselves.
9131,[removed]
9132,That's a great question.
9133,Emergency use approval is a fairly new concept.
9134,There isn't any legal precedent for this yet.
9135,It's all nestled snugly in a grey area.
9136,Shocker
9137,"Fuck the offspring, I'm sick of seeing headlines mentioning them."
9138,"It's just advertising people, this isn't news!"
9139,"They're literally trying to make people go ""huh the offspring must be cool I should give them another listen"" they did the same bullshit a few months back before they released a new album, all of a sudden reddit was flooded with ""TIL the offsprings singer went to college blahblahblah"""
9140,[removed]
9141,No shit.
9142,🤦🏻‍♂️
9143,Contagion is a bigger factor in mortality than lethality in most cases.
9144,"Double the contagion factor and you spread to twice as many people per cycle, and you overwhelm the local medical facilities that much harder and that much faster."
9145,"On the other hand, if you double the lethality, people die quicker and stop spreading it.\*

\* There are exceptions to that last bit."
9146,Ebola can transmit after death via sweat.
9147,"Prions, like Mad Cow Disease, really don't give a shit about anything."
9148,I expect there are others.
9149,"I work with kids which you can find in my post history I was talking about it just a couple days ago since you seem to like a snoop, also I have younger siblings who are still technically children so I’d like to think I have a fair bit knowledge."
9150,I made clear I’m not telling you how to parent.
9151,I’m just saying you should really research and consider if keeping your children out of normal society because of a virus that is literally like a cold to them or at worse the flu is really going to do more good than bad.
9152,Obviously you should try do what you can to keep your children safe but keeping them out of school and away from other kids can be very damaging.
9153,All I’m saying is it’s probable you’re doing more harm than good.
9154,An executive order is not a law
9155,Floridian here.
9156,I know many vaccinated adults who are not wearing masks.
9157,They are out in the public space and office with regularity.
9158,Many of them (not all) actually tested positive for Covid-19 in the past month.
9159,They were almost all asymptomatic (or symptoms comparable to MILD allergies).
9160,They actively had Covid-19 in the public space without knowing it.
9161,They spread Covid without knowing it.
9162,It is what it is.
9163,"My point is, at least in Florida, if you're un-vaccinated and maskless in the public, you will catch this Delta variant."
9164,May the odds be ever in your favor.
9165,So unvaccinated people are 3 times more likely to become infected.
9166,And practically 99% of the hospitalizations and deaths are unvaccinated.
9167,"Seems like an easy, simple decision to get vaccinated."
9168,I personally would be cool with everything except brain fog
9169,I work in a medical setting.
9170,We are still wearing them daily and there are lots of customers walking around same as fellow employees.
9171,"I find masks take away just enough of a persons fave that I, 1: Often think someone just MIGHT be someone I know(but I am wrong) 2: Am often unsure in the reverse when it is the actual person."
9172,It really does make you anonymous because you have to pay VERY close attention to figure out whos who.
9173,"As a parent with children too young to get vaccinated, how can I keep my kids safe at school that is not requiring masks?"
9174,"There is simply no room in the school system to keep the children six feet apart, so it's basically just going back to the pre-covid classroom setting."
9175,"His ""Community COVID Conversations"" are something to behold."
9176,I read if it doesn't happen in the first two weeks that you're chances of being clear are good

9178,Yeah... That is for Colorado... One state..

9193,Yep!
9194,I had to return to the US via a 3rd country when I was still on my visa here.
9195,"The presidential executive order that has prevented families from reuniting is the same one since March 2020, despite numerous changes in EU/ UK policy towards the US since then."
9196,That’s probably because a large portion of this sub had very limited social interaction as children
9197,"US did too, they (US and SU) funded the worldwede eradication so they could both weaponize it."
9198,"I got the same feeling, especially since he kept using the ""jab"" anti-vaxxer dogwhistle"
9199,"Peru does not have the same organizational capacity as China, and a ""lockdown"" in Peru is not the same as a ""lockdown"" in China."
9200,"On top of lockdowns, China now relies on its ability to do rapid, mass testing of entire cities to quell new outbreaks."
9201,I very much doubt that Peru is doing the same.
9202,"East Asian countries, like Vietnam, that did similarly well as China followed very similar strategies as China."

9212,Don't come out and play ..
9213,"Yes, it's 1/25th times whatever the chance is for unvaccinated people."
9214,"Remember though, that it doesn't tell you your actual chance, because that would depend on what an unvaccinated person's chance is and there are tons of different variables that go into that."
9215,Not all unvaccinated people are exposed to the virus and not everyone exposed to the virus contracts it.
9216,Stop reading the news then and just go enjoy your day.
9217,You’re vaccinated.
9218,"Or a patient will bring a gun, and if they’re denied service in the ER due to covid patients clogging up the system, I could see them holding doctors and nurses hostage to get treated for “elective” issues."
9219,They're not really sure what part of vaccines cause GBS.
9220,My mil had the standard vaccines required to go to Africa for holiday and one of them triggered it.
9221,She has it pretty bad; had to be intubated.
9222,"They think it's something in some flu vaccines, and recently I've read J&amp;J vaccine has a GBS warning, but overall it's a big ?."
9223,Mil took pfizer and had no ill side effects.
9224,"Handled it better than I did tbh, lol..."
9225,"So in long, it's something in a vaccine that triggers GBS, not covid itself"
9226,Did we get the sweet sweet oil though?
9227,Seems like the US only colonized Iraq for a short time and didn't extract that much.
9228,[removed]
9229,"The goal posts aren't moving, the ball is."
9230,The goal is to keep the virus at a manageable level.
9231,"Due to delta, it's spreading more quickly."
9232,The ball therefore gets further from the goal.
9233,"Yes, except covid is not going to go away anytime soon, so now we are discussing how we can go on living during the next few years."
9234,"Health officials aren’t telling sick people to wear masks, they’re asking for everyone to wear them, so the Asia argument is out of place here."
9235,I hope it’s clearer now.
9236,I think there is basically multiple new strain every year for the flu.
9237,Thats why we get flu shots each year and a few months before they determine the dominant flu strain that year.
9238,There are fingerprints in our DNA of past pandemics  that seemed to select for specific human polymorphisms (like ccr5Δ32).
9239,In some pandemics so many people died that we had to change our genome to overcome the pathogen.
9240,"I personally think it's the age of greed, since all decisions about avoiding short-term pain for the better of all in the long-term appear to stem from economic concerns."
9241,It's hard to take anything seriously from any politicians or experts when there's zero talk about preventing offices from forcing people back into the most unnecessary risk in this entire shit-show come September.
9242,"SOME argument can be made for kids in school, who and who is not an essential worker, etc., but after over a year of working from home, WFH should be a slam dunk, easy-to-avoid, it already works (better, in many cases) de facto stance."
9243,"The fact that Cuomo, for instance, said last week, something to the effect of, ""I think all offices in NYC should mandate a return after Labor Day because the city cannot withstand even a 15% decline in occupancy."""
9244,"Which I then thought, ""Well, game over, man..."" Cause even law firms in Manhattan are giving one or two flex days."
9245,That right there is 20% if everyone does it and it appears that everyone will do at least one day a week as a minimum.
9246,"So if you already know the pain is coming based on DECADES of short-sightedness on the part of employers, lack of investment in transit, and a gradual increase in bandwidth, and now a pandemic forced WFH all at once, just take the damned high road for once and urge some caution... so that you avoid further pain that may lead to *assured* economic destruction."
9247,"But the larger point is that when you have the Governor of the state with the first American COVID epicenter saying that everyone should take it on the chin, get back onto crowded trains and buses, go back into those petri dish stairwells at Penn to get to and from the trains, go to an office and sit ALL DAY in possibly poor ventilation, then go home and fret about whether or not their kids will get it at school, it's like... we've already lost the plot."
9248,We'd have ground to stand on with kids if the government took a stand with all the other unnecessary bs (getting vaxxed being a big one) and offices mandating return to work is a big one.
9249,"What, for instance, are parents to do if their kids are forced to stay home and quarantine?"
9250,What legal protections are there?
9251,"How can we say we're taking any of this seriously if someone can get fired for doing what's right for themselves, their family, and the community?"
9252,Indeed.
9253,"And in Guangzhou, Nanjing and a few other places."
9254,"But Anhui, Chongqing and many other places have not had any breaches."
9255,I'm glad you raised that point - that article was [linked a few days back](https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19/comments/osrftc/risk_of_myocarditis_from_covid19_infection_in/) (non-peer reviewed) and a couple of people raised some issues about the assumptions within the paper.
9256,"The 1/5000 number comes from Israel - I haven't reviewed to see if they've updated it, but I tend to trust them more than the CDC since their health system is more monitoring-focused."
9257,They have fairly good data.
9258,"Even if COVID is worse (and I believe it is), there is a variable of taking precautions that you simply cannot do with vaccines."
9259,"Masks, social distancing, staying safe - no one in my family got COVID or antibodies until we received the vaccine because we took this seriously from the start, *and* got lucky."
9260,"You're not guaranteed to get COVID, especially if you're a young 20-something year old working from home."
9261,"I shouldn't have generalized to everyone, but someone in my own family is dead set on not vaccinating their kid until a better alternative is approved."
9262,"They acknowledge it's risky, but can't bear to think of giving their kid heart inflammation when there's so little data on how the virus affects kids anyway."
9263,"Of course they're battling with the fact that once kids are in school, even if they manage to keep the masks on, they're interacting with others inevitably anyway."
9264,I'm fully vaccinated - got it the first week I can.
9265,I'd probably still have done it knowing what I know now (I am in the high risk group) but it's incredibly stupid that they're pushing Pfizer/Moderna when we know there's a link.
9266,"The flu vaccine linked to GB wasn't safe, and if it was produced today the FDA wouldn't have approved it."
9267,"Woah, anti vaccinate bumper stickers now?"
9268,That’s bold.
9269,"As hospitals fill here (Florida) and people’s kids get sick, I’d try not to stand out as a target since all of this is their fault."
9270,"On the other hand, if they had good risk assessment skills they probably would be vaccinated."
9271,😂
9272,Yeah I mean driving across country is what you make it or you just fly to them.
9273,I would just fly to them and wear a mask and all the other stuff we all did.
9274,Just don’t be the psychopath walking around in a hazmat suit playing candy crush.
9275,You need a nice egg 😔
9276,That's the first positive metric management has ever pulled up.
9277,Covid is a rapidly mutating virus and spreads extremely fast among non-vaccinated.
9278,"That's why it's a big deal, it's very difficult to contain."
9279,I truly feel sad for you and your family if that’s how vague and shallow your thought process is.
9280,"Can’t even be bothered to ask for my reasoning, I’m just automatically dumb...."
9281,I seriously doubt they would care.
9282,No need for hospital admission if you are dead before arrival.
9283,DeSantis for president!
9284,Yeah.
9285,Try getting selfish Americans to mask up.
9286,I’m sure they’ll listen lol
9287,They’re gonna kill their ppl cause politics

9296,Covid has exponential growth.
9297,"If there's record hospitalizations today, next week is going to be fucking crazy."
9298,Like he's trying to put perfume on a dog turd and say I dont smell anything.
9299,Which ironically is probably from Covid.
9300,True story.
9301,"Wife got phizer,  rest of us got Moderna."
9302,Wife currently in isolation because she has covid.
9303,The rest of us are negative.
9304,This isn't peer-reviewed.
9305,&gt; Long Covid is not new.
9306,No one said it was.
9307,&gt; It's a post viral syndrome.
9308,That doesn't mean it's equivalent to every other post viral syndrome.
9309,It's more common and it's more severe.
9310,And more people will get covid compared to other viruses.
9311,&gt; Read about ME/CFS and the experiences of those who have suffered it in recent decades.
9312,I have.
9313,&gt;  It's the same as long covid.
9314,No it;s not.
9315,"It's more common, more severe, and from a more contagious virus than things like the flu which you equated it to."
9316,Saying all post viral syndromes are the same is like saying a rhinovirus and HIV are the same because they're both viruses.
9317,"For the last time, please just stop."
9318,The Bronx is the Wild West of nyc.
9319,Lol.
9320,Oh please.
9321,Nobody is enacting universal mask mandates when there isn't a global pandemic.
9322,Circumstances are different when there is a *pandemic*.
9323,There is good reason to enact them in the current state of things.
9324,Nobody's going to mandate it if there's no active pandemic.
9325,Masking in other countries is a courteous thing to do.
9326,It's not even required.
9327,I'm not sure why Americans are so stupid that they would rather kill their friends and family than wear a flimsy piece of cloth.
9328,"Since the data from israel is likely what youre referring to...

""A New England Journal of Medicine study yesterday details breakthrough COVID-19 infections in 39 of 1,497 fully vaccinated Israeli healthcare workers, with most cases mild or moderate but 19% with symptoms lingering for more than 6 weeks""

source: https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/news-perspective/2021/07/israeli-study-finds-26-covid-breakthrough-infection-rate

ill take my chances and get vaccinated since this means that only ~7.5 people out of the ~1500 are experiencing long covid."
9329,if they were an unvaccinated sample population there would be way more infections and many more experiencing lasting symptoms.
9330,"disclaimer, this is regarding alpha."
9331,honestly if youre vaccinated i wouldnt be too worried about delta unless you have a really shit immune system.
9332,"it is looking like we are all going to have to get covid at some point, but being vaccinated can help you survive the first encounter so that your body can produce antibodies naturally as well."
9333,They thought that dangling the mask carrot would help.
9334,They grossly overestimated the massive bad faith of the antivaxers.
9335,"It’s not just inaccurate, it’s racist."
9336,“Model foreigners” and they misrepresent the culture.
9337,"The US didnt have an 100,000 case covid day until november of 2020."
9338,"Its already had 4 these past couple weeks including 285,000 in the last two days combined."
9339,"This coming fall and winter are going to be wild and if fauci’s fears come true, i can’t imagine what the numbers will end up looking like"
9340,A friend’s GF woke up with a fever today in Tampa.
9341,Next appointment they could find was Saturday.
9342,"No, it was the same under his predecessor."
9343,"It hasn’t been outright stated, but FEMA taskings of federal healthcare workers (HHS, DoD, IHS) have only ever been to areas where mask mandates are in place, and in the case of Texas, Louisiana, and North Dakota the mandates came just hours before the announcement of a pending deployment of federal healthcare workers."
9344,"I have a ton of friends who have deployed on those teams in the past 18 months, never with as much press as the first crews on the hospital ships (which quickly disembarked their doctors and nurses to local hospitals where they were much more useable)."
9345,"Thank you for everything you're doing to help people, and I'm sorry things are so bad."
9346,But lots of thieves and robbers lol
9347,A comment on a FB post of NYC with their mask mandate this week.
9348,"""People are still aborting babies."
9349,"Why isn't the government worried about that?"""
9350,"Like, you're not okay with abortion but you're okay with an easily spreadable virus that kids are getting plus unvaccinated people?"
9351,"So, mothers don't have the right to abort an unborn child because of their health."
9352,But you have the right to spread a virus to unvaccinated people?
9353,Including kids?
9354,"As an organization, and like the CDC, the WHO had one job - and they utterly failed at it."
9355,The WHO has been so ineffective and political during the pandemic that I no longer trust them on anything.
9356,Just saw a news clip of him blaming Biden because all of these new cases are coming through the southern border... Why am I more concerned about the lives of Floridians than their governor?
9357,You still haven't answered the question.
9358,The flu kills a lot of people annually and has killed more people over the course of history than covid.
9359,"Is it only the covid vaccine that matters, or should other criteria be included in the pass?"
9360,It’s not that they don’t think.
9361,They don’t know.
9362,So I thought delta was supposed to be satan reincarnated as covid.. what happened to that?..
9363,nobody scared of delta so the fear mongering must proceed.. let's get 1 solid antiviral together here.. early intervention should have been the primary goal not vaccines.. this whole dog and pony show ends with an antiviral
9364,Yes and that's why they mask when sick in Asia.
9365,You're literally advocating to not mask **WHEN ACTIVELY SICK** which was my entire point.
9366,That makes you no better than a plague rat.
9367,"People went to jail because of lead in water pipes in Flint, Michigan."
9368,The law knows how to deal with leaders who ignore right from wrong.
9369,These fanatics jailed someone for 3 or 5 years for accidentally voting wrong one time.
9370,Lock them up and throw away the key.
9371,"If someone told you that there was a magic button you could press, and once a year 3 kids wouldn't die from car crashes, would you not press it?"
9372,What if instead of a button it was $20 per year extra in taxes?
9373,Or spending 60 minutes pulling a lever?
9374,Don't compare the slight inconvenience of getting vaccinated with banning all cars.
9375,They're not even in the same plane of existence.
9376,"You definitely don't need a crazy system for that, I live in Europe and we don't have shootings around here."
9377,Absolutely.
9378,Getting off social media and just learning to be offline without being lonely is a good thing.
9379,When the kids are eligible to get vaccinated we are taking camping trips for the first time since I was a kid.
9380,Taking time away from the stress of others to try recover a sense of what it was like to just be OK... Is totally worth it &amp; would highly recommend.
9381,And we all know who turned it into a political thing.
9382,Only in the sense that their stupidity winds up hurting us in them creating new variants we have to worry about.
9383,So protecting them protects us as well.
9384,I'm just one guy in Florida but I renounced my republican party affiliation in November.

9386,I'll never vote for another republican again in my life.
9387,Well damn.
9388,I'm in Florida and have to make the decision to let our kids go back to school in a week after isolating for 18 months.
9389,This article just throws me over the edge.
9390,Delta variant is affecting younger kids and is more contagious.
9391,And our psychopathic governor playing politics with my kids life by not allowing school districts to mandate mask wearing.
9392,"This decision sent my wife into a panic attack, where she thought she was stroking out or having a heart attack."
9393,We spent 8 hours in the ER/COVID central.
9394,Luckily no stroke or heart issues for her.
9395,The worst part of that experience was that I saw numerous ER staff not wearing masks.
9396,I'm so damn sick of living like this.
9397,"Also to let you know what Florida is like, people still do Trump parades regularly."
9398,For real.
9399,Threatening people over mask mandates to keep children safe?
9400,They're really going to flip out when vaccines become mandated for kids to go to school.
9401,yeah its not like its going to block the piss on seat from getting you.
9402,lol
9403,Right.
9404,But I have seen people on the freeway driving miles with the mask on.
9405,"Judging by my downvotes, I guess it's entirely appropriate to wear a mask by yourself in the car."
9406,This sub is insane.
9407,Nice when politics matters more than Children’s lives.
9408,"Hate to break it to you, but germs are everywhere even if you swim in a tub of sanitizer."
9409,Not saying I want to go rub my boogers on people and lick poles but the point is you do you.
9410,We are not discussing people wearing a mask whilst sick.
9411,We are here to talk about covid and universal mask mandates.
9412,What you’re talking about is a separate issue.
9413,Yeah until very recently the people arguing that kids will be fine were right.
9414,Just compare the 2020 flu stats to covid for 18 and under.
9415,They are GOP.
9416,At least 20% of them have noone who loves them due to be stupid and abusive.

9426,before covid we didn't wash our hands unless we had literal shit on on them.
9427,Schools have already had to be shut down due to covid.
9428,Can't believe they're still going to go through with in person classes

9443,"While it would be better to avoid it altogether, I don't think there's enough evidence of it happening as a result of the vaccines to truly delay vaccinating under-12s when the virus is so clearly worse."
9444,"That being said, I don't know where you got the 1/5000 number from but I haven't seen any indication of it being that common."
9445,&gt; now we're in a situation where most parents don't want to vaccinate their kids.
9446,I haven't seen any polling to indicate this.
9447,I have children under 12 and I'll be on board with vaccinating them as soon as possible.
9448,Understood thanks!

9498,"In fact, long-term side effects are incredibly rare with any vaccine."
9499,the thing is nationally we are AT 70% for eligible people
9500,There's a lot of stupid comments on this thread.
9501,How many of y'all actually read the articles and posts by the people involved?
9502,Pete is spouting damn near antivax nonsense on Twitter and Insta.
9503,Music venues are going to need people to be vaccinated in order for them to perform.
9504,And I wouldn't be surprised if label heads and managers (the real bosses of the band) are in the same boat as well.
9505,"Also, when you have someone who literally has a PhD on the subject and y'all are still bashing the other members...do you hear yourselves?"
9506,Y'all suck.
9507,Pete is one of my favorite drummers of all time and The Offspring is my favorite band of all time...this sucks but it's the only move they can make as a BUSINESS.
9508,This affects the other members as well if he wouldn't be leaving the band.
9509,"Again, y'all suck."

9513,I want to travel again.

9518,Take the risk.
9519,I literally saw two anti-vax bumper stickers on the way to Publix this morning.
9520,"I’m seeing more people wear masks again, but there’s still a shit ton of people who dont"
9521,"Copied from my comment ro someone about covid in college above:

You dont ""fall behind"" if you take a break from school, you just don't progress."
9522,"In fact, you'll probably progress even better after a break, because a mental breakdown or catching covid WILL fuck up your time, energy, finances, and health, perhaps for a very long time."
9523,"People take a break or delay school for all kinds of reasons: disability/illness, having a kid, indecision, lack of funds, etc."
9524,Staying alive and mentally healthy are among the best reasons to take a break.
9525,Just ask Simone Biles.
9526,"Had she worked before she was ready, she could have broken her neck/got paralyzed/died."
9527,"Now, shes walking away with a medal, instead of not walking away at all."
9528,So how long until they start feeding corpses to the alligators to deal the overflow?
9529,Just saw this article about her from back in June: https://www.miamiherald.com/news/politics-government/state-politics/article251838913.html
9530,Only 90% of management being vaccinated is fucked up enough.
9531,You run a hospital.
9532,You don't believe doctors and you run a hospital.
9533,Get the fuck out.
9534,I didn't make this political.
9535,It was made political well over a year ago.
9536,At this point I'm just acknowledging reality.
9537,"Trend in under 18 hospitalizations in the southeast US:

https://mobile.twitter.com/cmyeaton/status/1422624128918556684

Essentially at the winter peak levels despite other age groups well below that and kids not in school."
9538,One of several reasons why everyone should still wear a mask indoors in public places.
9539,Sounds unconstitutional.
9540,They’ve already restored their mask mandate without a peep from the state.
9541,"Depends what your definition of ""Long haul"" is."
9542,"Loads of people every year get ""Long flu"" symptoms."
9543,"Coughing for a few months, not able to run as far without getting tired etc, however, these symptoms are ignored by people as non problematic."
9544,"However, currently, these symptoms can be placed under the umbrella of long covid."
9545,"The reason why long covid is more common than long flu is because, one, we have less immunity against covid so more case spread, and two, we are more fixated on long term symptoms after covid, symptoms that are ignored as irrelevant when people get them after the flu."
9546,"Chronic Fatigue Syndrome has been a thing for years, yet people, and the media, ignore it ."
9547,Eric Feigl Ding shrieking on twitter that those 2 countries are effecting mass murder by delaying doses turned out to be wrong?
9548,What!

9550,91% of harvard graduates are cum laude or higher.
9551,76% of harvard law graduates are cum laude or higher from the time when desantis attended.

9553,"Welcome to ""gentlemen's grading""."
9554,Gotta perpetuate the myth that they only accept the best of the best applicants by making sure GPAs stay high for anyone not likely to drop out.
9555,"For the elderly population, they actually are"
9556,"Lotsa of experts sayings it's not an ""if""... it's more of a ""when"" and ""where"" will a mutation come along that bypasses vaccination 100%."
9557,Will they be able to stop the spread of it?
9558,"Doubt it, considering what we've seen so far."
9559,Regulations are more lax and people are more pissed off than ever.
9560,Can't see how they'd be able to stop a new and more dangerous mutation running rampant.
9561,I can't believe hospital staff aren't striking.
9562,He doesn't give a fuck about them and what they are going through.
9563,That’s simply untrue and I’m gonna guess you know it.
9564,The end game is we go back to normal eventually.
9565,The only thing we should be instituting restrictions for is hospital capacity.
9566,Beyond that it's like any other disease going forward.
9567,And with being vaccinated the risk level is similar to a bunch of other diseases we already have.
9568,"Less than what I thought would, which is a good sign."
9569,"UCONN is a very large campus in a fairly liberal state, so they do appear to be in the minority there."
9570,"Making them go through the exemption process will help keep track of them too, for the extra testing requirements."
9571,"I just hope the students have to pay for their own testing out of their own pockets if it's not medically related, as it says only 55 requests were medical."
9572,You do understand that the virus keeps changing and not for the better?
9573,Delta is a whole new thing.
9574,It is not the last mutation in the pipeline.
9575,"Also, 20% of the new cases in in Arkansas are among children."
9576,More than 400 children have died in US so far.
9577,Far larger number and percentage than adults with serious side effects from vaccines.
9578,When all schools are open we will see a lot more children sick.
9579,"The main thing is, you don't know what virus you will finally get."
9580,"All the ""long term"" studies are on the original virus."
9581,It no longer exists.
9582,The next one may have twice the chance of causing death or erectile dysfunction as this one does.
9583,It will be better at keeping itself alive than the current virus.
9584,That's how it works.
9585,I don't doubt that you are a smart person with mad skills in some areas.
9586,You sound intelligent.
9587,"However, judging relative risks may not be your strong suit, at least based on your covid arguments."
9588,Good Luck to you.
9589,Lambda was first discovered in the United States in August 2020 and there are only like 200 cumulative cases so far today.
9590,I would look for a testing place that does drive thru testing to minimize potential exposure.
9591,"3-5 after potential exposure is recommended, and 4 days is the sweet spot, according to Dr. Daniel Griffin on the TWIV podcast last week."
9592,"As for the tests, he said that the antigen tests are probably the ideal test going forward for previously vaccinated people as they will only show positive if you have an infectious amount of virus present."
9593,"Also, don’t count on being able to find the at home antigen tests last minute."
9594,"As of two days ago, we couldn’t find them anywhere after visiting 4 different pharmacies in our area—they were sold out everywhere."
9595,The pharmacists said the weren’t expecting new shipments for several weeks.
9596,"As of today Amazon has some BinaxNow tests, but they didn’t have any available last night."

9599,Bad people can be smart too.
9600,I heard it on my radio every day for a year.
9601,South America in general believes in vaccines.
9602,Here in Uruguay we are at 72% of the total population with at less one dose and 62% with two.
9603,At what point does the spike protein turn on itself?
9604,Someone please correct me here but aren’t the vaccines specifically targeting spike?
9605,So if it mutates to evade the vaccines completely wouldn’t that basically mean the spike is no longer viable for infection?
9606,Or are we looking at a potentially brand new strain?
9607,Need this explained to me.

9609,At some point corporate America needs to be unified and demand the GOP expel the crazy.
9610,This stuff harms American business.
9611,Should we also take insurance away from fat people while we’re at it?
9612,It seems very obvious that the virus can't really propagate much when 9 out of 10 person have antibodies (from vaccine or previous infections) in the UK.
9613,"What I get from the headline is no one wants to admit or accept that this is over in the UK (and by the way we saw the same in the Netherlands) because everyone has an agenda: media wants you to keep clicking (CNN lost 40% of traffic when Trump left the office), Vaccine need to be sold, governments want to get more power (that whats they are built for) via coercion."
9614,"Some of us citizens of the world want to continue to signal their virtue by being a good mask wearer, and other wants to have a reason to blame and hate other people that are not vaccinated yet."
9615,And I'm saying all that by being vaccinated since April.
9616,"We have a clear evidence that the UK is out of the hole without lockdown or shelter in place, buti Think only a minority of people is willing to accept that"
9617,People like that are ticking time bombs anyway.
9618,Our current world full of media disinformation has primed millions to go berserk.
9619,We can’t keep placating them.

9642,"Nobody on this particular subreddit wants to hear this exact angle, but I think the Delta variant - combined with our vaccines that effectively defang Covid - ends the highly dangerous phase of this pandemic quickly."
9643,Delta is so transmissible that it’ll just rip through a huge swath of the unvaccinated population (as it’s doing now).
9644,"People on here seem to think it doing so somehow delays the end, but in many ways it speeds it up."
9645,"It’s a hugely dangerous and suboptimal way to end the pandemic since vaccination would be far more effective and the safest route, but soon the US, like the UK, will have more than 90% of the population with antibodies and some kind of immune system memory."
9646,"And when that happens, Covid will still exist and circulate but it’ll kill very very few relative to the rest of the pandemic."
9647,"And when Covid becomes like the 40th most lethal killer, we’ll have no choice but to move on."
9648,Hang tight!
9649,Edit: Concerns about further mutation are obviously fair.
9650,"Thinking globally (I mean, hell, Delta is from India and likely emerged from densely packed slums) and remembering the large animal reservoir make it seem impossible to ever dent viral evolution in a significant way."
9651,"However, I don’t know if it’s wise to assume it’s *likely,* though, that we see a variant that’s fully evasive and still super transmissible."
9652,"While I continue to hear that it’s *possible,* I also have heard several immunologists explain that the elegant beauty of these vaccines is that they make it unlikely that Covid would mutate in a way that fully evades them because of the nature of the spike protein (without rendering themselves harmless)."
9653,"As vaccine experts have reminded people of:
•Vaccines are polyclonal 
•CD8+ T-cells covering 52 epitopes across the spike protein 
•CD4+ T-cells covering 23 epitopes across the spike protein
(I recommend following @sailorrooscout on Twitter, who works with vaccines and can explain this better.)"
9654,"And, thankfully, a breakthrough doesn’t mean evasion or that the vaccines aren’t working:
https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2021/07/anatomy-of-a-vaccine-breakthrough/619562/"
9655,I think studies have showed mothers giving antibodies to their child when breastfeeding.
9656,Of course that poses an issue if breastfeeding isnt possible.
9657,"All of them are usually, just because it's harder to get tested and get results back on the weekend."
9658,"Actually, if you read his reply, he does also spread some antivax disinformation."
9659,"As a vaccinated person in a 50% vaxed state trying to balance living a “normal” life with making some effort to not get covid, it all feels pretty futile at this point."
9660,"I still wear a mask indoors, but I’ve come to resent it because the looks I get hardly feel worth the minimal protection that I can have or provide as one masked person out of 20 in a store…meanwhile most of the unvaccinated took off their masks a year ago."

9670,They are pulling out all the stops to make the vaccines seem ineffective to casual readers.
9671,I think your bar is pretty high.
9672,The cost of keeping everyone uninfected vs the cost of just limiting hospitalizations.
9673,It’s a huge difference.
9674,The goal in the covid fight might not have to be zero infections.
9675,Rather aim to limit hospitalization.
9676,We don’t have zero infections policy from influenza.
9677,Kids get influenza and we don’t care much about it because it is not severe for them.
9678,There has to be a middle ground in this somewhere.
9679,We will never be free from viruses.

9696,There's not a really a downside.
9697,"I don't, but having a child does not make you more or less qualified to talk about probabilities."
9698,Your child has a minscule probability of suffering long term severe illness due to COVID.
9699,"According to a study by King's College London, 

Fewer than one in 20 children with symptomatic COVID-19 experienced symptoms lasting longer than 4 weeks, and almost all children have fully recovered by 8 weeks, a new study has found."
9700,"https://www.kcl.ac.uk/news/long-covid-uncommon-in-children

Most ""long covid"" symptoms are mild and even more moderate symptoms improve."
9701,"There's no way of guaranteeing your child won't be ill, but there was no way of guaranteeing that when a child gets the flu they don't suffer a long term disability, such as Chronic Fatigue Symptom."
9702,"The reality that parents will have to accept is that anyone, child or adult, who lives a moderately social existence in the future, will get COVID."
9703,"There isn't really a way around this problem, but the probability of a child getting long term severe illness is miniscule."
9704,There are far more risks to a 3 month year old baby than long covid.
9705,Someone else just provided a couple of paper citations that said they’re “broadly similar”.
9706,Do you know why a vaccine would be more effective than the **actual** virus going through your body?
9707,"Personally, I’m worried you’re right, since it looks like even 100% vaccine coverage won’t get us to herd immunity."
9708,Maybe we're not talking about the same document.

9710,We are not masking forever.
9711,Wearing a mask at home is over the top.
9712,&gt;  in the same way there is a risk of long flu and other long term after effects from viral infections.
9713,Stop it.
9714,Covid isn't the flu.
9715,Long haul is much more common with covid than the flu.
9716,Just stop.
9717,"Considering that the current vaccines still offer a efficacy of ~70-80% against infection (and even higher against hospitalization and death) with Delta, we overshot that 50% mark significantly."
9718,The vaccines really are a medical marvel.
9719,I spent a year with severe depression over COVID and it took a huge toll on my mental health.
9720,"After getting vaccinated a few weeks ago, I feel much safer."
9721,"Guys, I know things are scary with SOMEWHAT vaccine resistant variants coming out left and right."
9722,Just know we are incredibly protected while vaccinated and I trust that science will absolutely kick the shit out of any majorly vaccine resistant variant with a targeted booster in the future.
9723,"Keep living your life and trying to find joy in every day, knowing that we live in a time when we can get a highly effective vaccine after only a year of this virus existing."
9724,Any resistant variant that comes out will get its ass kicked by science.
9725,STAY STRONG EVERYONE!
9726,People seem to be forgetting that vaccine updates aren't all that hard.
9727,"Especially now with the mRNA platforms, a new formula could be up and running in less than 2 months."
9728,"If we imagine a scenario where most of the world has a pretty good vaccine coverage and some crazy variant comes up, we'll probably have +80% of protection against death and vaccines would be updated and we'd get these new shots, just like the flu."
9729,Not saying that this is exactly what's going to happen but I'm not sure this fear-mongering helps anybody.
9730,You know sometimes i feel lile a failure.... Then i read shit like this and suddenly ithat feeling goes away.
9731,"I mean, that just means he had a 3.4-3.6."

9746,"Do you think that this provides a strong argument for providing immunocompromised people with a 3rd shot, to give them something as close to sterilizing immunity as possible and ensure the virus has as little opportunity to mutate in them as possible?"
9747,"(Btw, just clocked your username from your previous comments, and I wanted to mention I've been really appreciating your input in general on the covid subs in the last few weeks.)"
9748,&gt; But Delta looks less benign than vanilla Covid.
9749,The reports coming out of Louisana hospitals is that Delta is causing more severe cases in kids than vanilla did.
9750,"Yes, but you can't make this argument based on the percentage of number of cases that are kids."
9751,You need a different report for it.
9752,"Case to the point: here are Ontario numbers, where roughly 20% of the population are children:

Table 1b."
9753,"Summary of recent confirmed cases of COVID-19 by age group and gender: Ontario

 As you can see, children in Ontario overall represent 20% of all cases, and over 30% of recent cases."
9754,Does it tell us *anything* about severity of epidemic in Ontario?
9755,No.
9756,"If anything, right now kids are overrepresented in case numbers, because they have no vaccine available for them."
9757,Good luck with that.
9758,Not alone buddy.
9759,Stay safe.
9760,You matter!
9761,We can get through this.
9762,"It is really fucked up to wish or applaud anyones death, regardless if they cause it to themselves or not."
9763,The people who don't take vaccines are still human beings and we should treat them as such.
9764,"If they die because they didn't take the vaccine, well then it has been their demise, but in no circumstance should anybody laugh at other peoples unfortunate choices."
9765,Death is not a thing to be laughed at.
9766,"""Rendered useless"" is a severe misunderstanding at least where the mRNA vaccines are concerned."
9767,What these vaccines target is an aspect very fundamental to fitting the ACE2 receptor and thus being infectious.
9768,"Delta's reputation for breakthrough (at a rate that's still low, but worrisome) isn't so much that the vaccine is a mismatch, as that viral load is just so overwhelming."
9769,Really we need to be moving beyond supply constraints - this isn't the last time were going to need to rapidly produce and administer an mRNA vaccine globally.
9770,"It's important to not only get availability everywhere, but also to get sufficient saturation in early adopter countries to demonstrate that full population vaccination at boosted depth actually can be a solutuon - vs partial population vaccination, which it's being clearly demonstrated is only a mitigation measure to use in concert with masks and some distancing."
9771,We have those in California too
9772,What we do know is that Delta is causing higher viral loads.
9773,The headline should be taken seriously because higher viral loads are typically correlated with sicker people.
9774,"If Delta does not cause people to get sicker faster when it is causing higher viral loads than other strains of covid, it would be the exception, not the norm."
9775,That is enough to start warning people of the possibility before there's concrete evidence so they can take proper precautions while it is spreading.
9776,Worst case scenario is people keep ignoring precautions and get sicker quicker.
9777,The alternative is they take precautions and help protect themselves but nothing happens.
9778,The alternative is much better than the worst case scenario.
9779,It's kinda because his comments are coming from a purely theoretical ideal situation.
9780,It would be great if we could all just shut every human being on the planet followed these guidelines to point but alot of us are kinda done with it specifically those who are vaccinated.
9781,He likes the limelight and that's not a good trait for a person in his position.
9782,hope us covid-free vacinated folks don't have a similar situation in the future...
9783,"Ironically, I play in an amateur cover band (no Offspring songs though!)"
9784,and our drummer won't get vaccinated either.
9785,"We are in Florida and he's not really political, he's just scared."
9786,"He's scared to get the vaccine, he's scared to get covid."
9787,More than the rest of us he depends on income from music so he can't just sequester.
9788,"We are supportive and have tried to get him to get the jab, but end of the day if he doesn't it's his call."
9789,Half the people around us don't have the vaccine and my fatalistic current thinking is:  we all are going to get exposed to delta considering how contagious it is--I'm just glad I and my family are vaccinated so effects should be minimal.
9790,"His buddy had a bad dose of covid as well, the buddy told me he wouldn't wish it on his worst enemy."
9791,"So with all the evidence you need, and you still don't do it--just shaking my head and I am not going to be concerned for people being ignorant."
9792,Realistically it should probably be required the whole time until our vaccination rates increase but people are shitty so there's constant pressure to remove mask mandates.

9801,"He cited a condition that does exist in the real world (Guillain-Barré syndrome), but he did it in such a way that really made it sound like an ad hoc rescue."
9802,Especially since he went on to pretty much say that others shouldn't have to get vaccinated if they don't feel like it.
9803,My understanding is that it might only be an issue if an adenovirus vaccine (like J&amp;J) is used... but even then the odds are overwhelmingly against its being an issue.
9804,I got the feeling that he was trying to get out in front of the news and put his spin on it before he got blackballed for being an anti-vaxxer.
9805,Do you base this assessment off of faith?

9808,"I'm wondering, if Delta + is more transmissable what has kept it from becoming the dominant strain in India up until now?"
9809,If it is more transmissable it may have some weaknesses that allow Delta to propgate while Delta plus seems pretty rare.

9828,I'll take your antibodies whichever way you'll give it to us so that we can slowly move on from this virus.
9829,I agree.
9830,But also I think we’re living in a time where everything is instantaneously shared at such a rapid rate that it naturally propagates miscommunication and misunderstandings.
9831,"Back in the day, the scientific community would usually do all this research quietly and then share the results in a journal."
9832,"But with social media, any report is shared, dissected, and commented by many people who aren’t even experts."

9835,All the studies show they’re effective against delta.

9837,Optimism (not naivety) and a healthy state of mind are critical if we’re ever going to get out of this.
9838,Its political.

9840,Still not political ?

9876,Vaccinated people are seen to get infected 1/2 to 1/3 as often as Unvaccinated people (in recent reports on this subreddit) -- so being vaccinated **will** slow the spread.

9887,It's just an objective fact.
9888,The fact that long covid rates halves in children in the space of a few weeks makes it clear that many who have it have very benign symptoms.
9889,"Long covid isn't some scary new illness, it's a normal, although often ignored, reality for people who suffer viral infections."

9942,It found that three-quarters of cases occurred in fully vaccinated people.

9949,"Not as high as I’d hoped damn, we need rapid antigen tests like everywhere"
9950,"On the one hand, that makes sense."

9952,"Remember when the headlines said “viruses mutate but this PhD tells us why that can be a good thing.”

It’s completely understandable that we didn’t conclusive evidence but I also believe we should take this seriously."
9953,"Yes, viruses mutates but we can do more to either prevent or slow that from happening."
9954,Pretty sure the CEO of Pfizer said it would take 3 months to make a new vaccine.
9955,I don’t know if that includes testing considering it only takes a few days to create an mRNA vaccine once you have the genome sequence.
9956,"I still don’t see this virus mutating enough to not have the spike on the cell of the virus for at least the next few years, which is what the mRNA vaccines train alert your immune system to look out for."
9957,Then how can an outbreak that has spread to multiple cities only have 70-something infected people?
9958,"The thing is very simple; either the Chinese officials suck at contact tracing, which I don’t believe , or they underreport the numbers in comical fashion."

9963,"It did actually - plague, smallpox and cholera remained endemic for centuries, until radical changes in technology and society occurred, barely 100 years ago."
9964,"Science kept deadly contagions at bay for a century, but has run into an extremely adaptable virus on one hand and overwhelming human ignorance and arrogance on the other and has run out of miracles for the time being."

9966,"I've been irritated by some of the CDC's decisions for a lot of the pandemic, but this has really damaged my trust in them."
9967,"Defining breakthrough cases as only hospitalized cases, and not even opting to track them is pretty absurd, and damages trusts in the vaccines if you ask me."
9968,"masks work well if done right, this has been established from the start of the pandemic."
9969,"However impact of masks isn't binary, it's probabilistic based on the type of mask, type of environment, age, immunity level, sanitization, crowd sizes, number of people infected, and sadly dishonesty about truly masking."
9970,"As for lockdowns, unless done properly, it's useless, the issue isn't that lockdowns won't stop the spread, of course they will because there won't be human interaction; rather the issue is of human behavior and compliance."
9971,Well when have we ever dealt with a coronavirus pandemic?
9972,We have dealt with flus.
9973,This is different so we really don’t know
9974,"CDC's finding was that in breakthrough cases, the viral load of vaccinated people and unvaccinated people are similar."
9975,The key is in that it only applies to breakthrough cases.
9976,"For the vast majority of vaccinated people, the infection be asymptomatic, which will have extremely low to zero chance of spreading to other people."
9977,"The vaccine does not prevent 100% of the transmission, but 90% prevention is still a lot better than 0% and will definitely still slow the spread overall."
9978,"COVID-19 really opened my eyes to this phenomenon

I never knew viruses could have such long lasting impacts"
9979,Has any country with high vaccination status gone back into lockdown?
9980,This isn't even worth reporting on my god

9983,"So, yeah... some are getting sick."
9984,That’s awesome - where did you go to medical school?
9985,I literally don’t even know where to begin with this ignorant and uneducated comment.
9986,These are the same people who used to wear their masks under their noses and as chin straps.
9987,I’ll keep wearing mine in stores thank you.
9988,I’m still not eating inside restaurants (but have spent plenty on take out).
9989,You're using that wrong btw.
9990,it doesn't apply to all rentals.
9991,Children getting COVID is not a tragedy.
9992,They will continue to get COVID and suffer symptoms from COVID in the future irrespective whether they get vaccinated or not.
9993,That's just the reality of COVID.
9994,It's not going to go away.
9995,Countries who cannot even vaccinate their elderly due to no vaccine supply is a real tragedy.
9996,I get all my medical advice from Ron desantis /s
9997,"Yep, very sad to see them go to waste."
9998,"I think legislatures need to pass some laws that say something to the effect of ""When the doses are 14 days away from being expired, they can be shipped to somewhere where people will actually use them""."
9999,"Might even cause an uptick in the vaccination rate, because xenophobic assholes might take the vaccine to ensure it doesn't go to a foreigner."
10000,Will it?
10001,I hope so but it’s not really behaving like the flu
10002,The mayor said these restrictions don’t apply to children under 12
10003,I'd rather live in risk of dying for a virus than spend my entire life in fear of lockdown or social distancing.
10004,Let alone subjecting other generations to it.
10005,Sometimes quality of life is more important than quantity.
10006,&gt;Covid was never going to go away.
10007,"That's where you are wrong, it could have been stopped with a quick and decisive lockdown."
10008,If you have few enough cases you can trace every contact.
10009,Few cases also means very few mutations so it's highly unlikely to spawn variants.
10010,Only now that it's truly global and there are tons of virus reservoirs around the world it's unlikely to fully go away.
10011,Very high vaccination rates may still lead to quasi herd immunity as transmission rates between vaccinated people seems to be highly reduced even for delta.
10012,"The UK has never had masks in school for Primary age children, i.e."
10013,under-11s.
10014,Scientifically there really has never been much of a doubt here.
10015,"In Germany for example, but also other EU countries, it is standard to get mRNA shot 2nd after you had an AZ shot first."

10026,Covid sites cost money and money is political.
10027,&gt;They perceive a personal benefit from people behaving in a certain way and pursue convincing them to do so.

10029,"Employers perceive a benefit in making people work for them, and convince them to do so by paying them and providing benefits."
10030,"But to answer you directly: yes, I have a child who is more at risk, and is not eligible for the vaccine yet because of her age."
10031,"I want her safe, at least until the vaccine is approved for her age group."
10032,It frustrates me when people make that more difficult.
10033,"My wife is also more at risk for multiple factors, and had a severe reaction to the vaccine."
10034,I want to keep her safe as well.
10035,It benefits my family if people vaccinate to help reduce the spread of the disease.
10036,It benefits my family if additional variants are not created.
10037,But it doesn't benefit just my family.
10038,"I find it frustrating how much of the population is completely uncaring of the less fortunate in our society, especially when they do not bother to educate themselves ABOUT the less fortunate."
10039,"The public health guidance has changed with recommendations that vaccinated people start wearing masks again, if I understand correctly."
10040,"I'm willing to comply with that, because the public health guidance is focused on reducing the spread of COVID and reducing the number of variants given."

10067,"Israel, UK, and Germany are rolling out now exactly what I got

10068,Wow.

10070,There is always a grey area when it comes to constitutional rights.

10115,It's just that infant and child mortality drove down the average.
10116,If you made it to adulthood the scariest part was over until old age.
10117,Note that China has not yet mandated vaccination.
10118,"So far, the message from the top has been that vaccination is voluntary."
10119,"My guess is that if they don't reach their target, the message will change."
10120,"But so far, they've been relying on the willingness/desire of the population to get vaccinated."
10121,"The strongest disincentive has been that there has been virtually no CoVID-19 in China, but outbreaks like the current one remind people that the virus is still out there and still dangerous."
10122,The fact that there’s no endgame at this point is what’s really scary to me.
10123,"The vaccine is here and it looks like we’re gonna be doing this far into 2022, and possibly later."
10124,The variants are gonna be a never ending cycle.
10125,I feel like the experts deep down want to push for eradication but they know the public will isn’t there so they can’t say that directly.
10126,"So, your risk assessment is not based on actual risks for each branch."

10134,We have to get everyone vaccinated.
10135,There's no other option for a good endgame.

10177,"My wife was like ""I hope people don't think we're *those* *people*..."" because we kept wearing masks after we were vaccinated and the who messaging was that you could stop wearing the mask if you were vaccinated."
10178,But it turns out the anti-vaxxers don't wear the masks and all the smart people who got vaccinated are still wearing masks around us sooooo no worries there.
10179,The study they refer to in that article looked only at the Chinese vaccine CaronaVac which is more of a traditional study vaccine compared to the mRNA vaccines like Pfizer.
10180,CoronaVac has been inferior to Pfizer/Moderna since day one.
10181,I believe it only has like 65% efficacy compared to 95ish% for the mRNA vaccines.

10613,Before heading to the venue I and the guy I was staying with and his buddy were sitting in a coffee shop.
10614,Guy I was staying with had never rolled a spliff before and was determined to do it.
10615,"Meanwhile, other dude and I sat there smoking bowl after bowl of super skunk or something."
10616,I wasn't much of a smoker and didn't have a tolerance so I ended up getting higher than I've ever been before or since.
10617,I ended up getting greenout stoned and was in and out of awareness.
10618,I only have a handful of memories after leaving the coffee shop that night.
10619,We went to the venue still a little before the show was starting and I remember walking up to the stage where some guys were setting up.
10620,"I asked, ""Are you with the band?"""
10621,"and one guy replied, ""We are the band."""
10622,"I'm out of my head at this point but I realized I just embarrassed myself a bit, also I was getting nauseous so I went outside and sat on the curb and proceeded to puke."
10623,Next thing I know people are standing around me telling me I'd better get out of there before the cops come and make me clean it up.
10624,I go back in the venue and go to the balcony and proceed to pass out against the railing facing the stage.
10625,I ended up sleeping through the entire show only waking up to hear part of We're Only Going to Die from Our Own Arrogance.
10626,To this day I'm very disappointed in myself.
10627,But the earning potential for most NFL players is condensed to a few years.
10628,Regular folk work for decades.
10629,You can't just compare salaries.
10630,My uncle had that and was never the same after he survived it.
10631,It was a really bad battle!
10632,Of course it left him vulnerable to the virus and he didn’t survive it

10677,"So after being proven totally wrong about the statement that cases aren't going up there, and can't happen there, you not only show no attempt at learning, but only to give backdated data in response, as though it would be information to me."

10695,This is the line that made me close out of the article.

10796,&gt; Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS) is a rare neurological disorder in which the body's immune system mistakenly attacks part of its peripheral nervous system—the network of nerves located outside of the brain and spinal cord.
10797,A close friend of mine has (and has had) health issues related to his brain and nervous system that his doctors over the years haven't yet been able to diagnose or identify.
10798,He and I both got vaccinated in March / April.
10799,"While I (a relatively normal person) had the sore arm after the first shot and was laid up after the second shot, he was laid up for 2 weeks after the first shot, and has been dealing with after-effects of the second shot (and his bodies reaction to the vaccine) for the past 5 months."
10800,"His neuro, PC, and other doctors have been running bloodwork over and over and trying to find a reason why."
10801,"They have told him that he absolutely cannot get a booster, and they are now considering shutting down his immune system and putting him on steroids (after he sees a specialist the end of this month) to try and 'make him right' again."
10802,"He has liver issues, and all manner of complications."
10803,"I assure you: he, his wife and I are absolutely pro-vaccine, but he happens to have extreme complications from it."

10811,Obviously everybody is different but being that my mom has an autoimmune disorder I've been keeping an eye out for any info on negative interactions with the vaccine and I haven't seen anything yet.
10812,Just something to consider.

10814,"To who, non vaxxed?"
10815,Oh noooo... our families safely vaxxed now so im not so concerned.

10836,RIP Weird Al
10837,There are still loads of people at risk who are unvaccinated I would guess.
10838,The vaccines actually cause a much greater resistance than getting the disease does.
10839,If you get it once you can easily get it again.

10842,My friend in Northern Europe was finally able to make an appointment for his first Pfizer dose and was given the option of getting his second dose in two weeks or six weeks.
10843,So now he has to choose.
10844,"Extend the length of time in which is is vulnerable to the delta variant and likely get better longterm protection, or get the shot in two weeks to get the full immunity ASAP."
10845,He has a little boy at home who will be going back to school soon.
10846,I'm not sure what I would choose.
10847,There is something strange about Woldometer's death data for Missouri.
10848,"If you look at the official [Missouri covid dashboard](https://health.mo.gov/living/healthcondiseases/communicable/novel-coronavirus/data/public-health/statewide.php), you can see a clear upward trend starting around mid-June and peaked on July 17th at 13 deaths per day (compared to 4 deaths per day at the lowest point)."
10849,"Since it takes a few days for deaths to be processed and the Missouri dashboard puts the death at the date when the death actually occurred, I expect the curve to continue the upward trend until this wave has subsided (likely this week)."
10850,"I am not sure where Woldometer receives data for Missouri, but it's different from Missouri site."
10851,T cell and B cell immunity
10852,Awesome.
10853,That’s what happens when your lead singer has a doctorate.
10854,Many hospitals in the country are overwhelmed.
10855,That's just a plain false statement.
10856,I've read a significant amount of articles indicating higher hospitalizations for children and severe long term effects such as fatigue and brain fog.
10857,I am not sure you are familiar with brain fog but as a cancer patient i am.

10863,I when I got my vaccine back in March and April I waited in line like 30-45 minutes even though I had an appt.
10864,That was at a Kroger pharmacy though and I believe they packed in a bunch of appts early morning when I went.
10865,But that was when vaccines first were opened to all.
10866,Now I don’t think the wait is very long at most places as the demand has come down significantly.
10867,I would be surprised if it took more than 15 minutes.
10868,30 minutes max.
10869,You usually have to fill out a short consent form.
10870,Sides effects are normally harsher after 2nd dose.
10871,First dose my arm was briefly tender.
10872,But hardly an issue.
10873,"2nd dose I just felt a little fatigued, arm hurt quite a bit, and I had body aches for a day and a half."
10874,Because your anecdote does not equate to science.
10875,"Also, playing Russian roulette with the virus like that is just nonsensical."
10876,"Problem: It can mutate in vaccinated people  

Solution: None"
10877,"Alabama, which obviously is spiking, reported 32 statewide child hospitalizations for Covid last week."
10878,It’s way up but not crazy numbers.
10879,"At what point can we say, “I’m a 20 something with no underlying condition fully vaccinated, sorry I’m not sacrificing years of my life so I can make a few very old or very sick people have a slightly lower chance of getting a virus that has a 99% survival rate” and going back to enjoy life, maybe getting COVID and getting over it."
10880,"I mean, you kinda have some control over your wife's pregnancy no?"
10881,What a stupid argument.
10882,"Yes, germs spreading naturally is fine."
10883,What's not fine is willingly wiping your snot everywhere and claiming that's the same thing.

10917,Find me the Delta reinfecting someone severely
10918,Thousands of people in my lifetime will spread their germs to me.
10919,"Some of these people will be wearing masks, some will not be wearing masks."
10920,"Some will have good personal hygiene, some will not have good personal hygiene."
10921,"Some of the germs will make me sick, some won't."
10922,"None of those who spread their germs to me will be pigs, they will be humans."
10923,Please don't dehumanize people.
10924,"This is the part in the sci-fi movie where a well-meaning scientist tries to engineer a ""less dangerous variant"" and turn us all into zombies."
10925,And yet Florida has only 1/5 the active cases of California.
10926,https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/country/us/
10927,Well that goes without saying
10928,An 8mo old article about the alpha variant doesn’t seem as relevant with the delta now circulating.
10929,"DeSantis is bad enough, but it's the people who won't critically think about the crap the he spews, are far worse imo."
10930,They blindly accept whatever he says without question.
10931,I could never live in such willful ignorance.

10933,"But if you tell yourself all statistics that disagree with your beliefs are wrong, or made up, then you get to where my parents are."
10934,"&gt;Israel published a report a week ago saying that Pfizer is only 39% effective at preventing infection with delta

From the horse's mouth:

&gt;You’ve probably seen reports from Israel on low vaccine effectiveness in this wave."
10935,Is it because of Delta?
10936,Waning immunity?
10937,We think the reason is mostly that we got the denominator wrong.
10938,"[https://mobile.twitter.com/dvir\_a/status/1420059124700700677?s=20](https://mobile.twitter.com/dvir_a/status/1420059124700700677?s=20)

Israel needs to publish their data before I'll take anything they say seriously considering they published that data and used the wrong dataset as the denominator."
10939,No - it’ll get to a point for me where I have done everything I possibly can to help and look out for everyone else.
10940,But I matter too and so does my happiness.
10941,"If it’s absolutely hopeless, I will not live in fear anymore and just move on with my life."
10942,I’m hoping it’ll never get to that point and we will all end the pandemic in the next year together.
10943,And those individual cohorts should be taking the necessary precautions that their doctors recommend for them.
10944,"I never went around worrying I would die from the flu, but my grandma did because she had lung cancer."
10945,Did I want the flu?
10946,No.
10947,Did I wash my hands after going to the bathroom?
10948,Yes.
10949,Did I wear a mask in the grocery store?
10950,No.
10951,Did I go to grimy dive bars crammed with people?
10952,Yes.
10953,Did my grandma do that?
10954,No.

10958,"I'm not planning my life around that possibility, but if it happens I will reassess how I should live."
10959,It should be easy enough to get a vaccine and not take very long.
10960,Just go to your local pharmacy and ask.
10961,"As for your symptoms they could be a bad case of the chills and feeling awful, to absolutely nothing."
10962,I had pretty much no symptoms besides being tired.
10963,You could easily disguise your symptoms as just not feeling well.
10964,You can take pain killers afterwards to help with it.
10965,#there is nothing to show that the unvaccinated people brought COVID to this event.
10966,My wife a year after infection was in a closed window car with her (then infectious) father who was an antimasker for 2 days as they drove across the country.
10967,Neither of us got sick.
10968,So why do we HAVE TO take a rushed emergency vaccine
10969,"&gt; They are not all equivalent

Then stop equating them

&gt; Long covid, in of itself, is not a worse viral syndromes

You say they're not equivalent then you say they're the same thing."
10970,Congrats on being the least credible person on the internet today.
10971,Makes sense since most kids can't get vaccinated.
10972,do you have the links to the studies
10973,lol 20%...
10974,I'm in the South and it's *maybe* 5% since the mandate was dropped with schools refusing to require them at all.
10975,It's absolutely maddening.
10976,It's in large part because these big box stores don't want to have their employees have to police and enforce masking.
10977,Many police departments even in democratic cities have said they will not enforce mask mandates any longer.
10978,That means it's up to the 15 dollar an hour (or worst) employees putting their health on the line.
10979,Workers have literally been killed over trying to enforce masks in stores.
10980,I’m with you.
10981,Got long covid.
10982,Bed bound for 1.5 years.
10983,"I can only say, you will learn how to survive."
10984,it’s all we can do.
10985,Yea I told my sister to quit her nursing job before it ruins her or her family.
10986,There is no winning right now unfortunately
10987,"As someone who was vaccinated, how long am I immune for?"
10988,Will this be like the flu where I have to go every year?
10989,"This is why I'm still wearing a mask regardless, I'm not sure when my immunity runs out."
10990,"Thank you for your wisdom, Raccoon\_Full\_of\_Cum."
10991,I'm now exiting the things I've read about and am just going to take an educated guess: I don't think chickenpox mutates fast enough to ever exceed your body's ability to produce new antibodies when it sees it again.
10992,"That is until you start getting older, or experience some kind of immune deficiency later on."
10993,"Then you can get shingles, which is when latent viral chickenpox particles reactivate in your nerve cells and you get a painful rash."
10994,That happens with some frequency in the elderly.
10995,"The same can often be said for vaccination, which is why many vaccines need boosters."
10996,"Tetanus, for instance, requires a booster every 10 years or so."
10997,"I'm not sure if that's a product of the bacterium that causes it, or more a matter of our immune system."
10998,"And I don't think anyone knows what will happen with the Covid vaccines, except that they know people who had the original SARS still have immunity 18 years later, and experienced better outcomes from Covid infections."
10999,I really wish politicians would humanize doctors and nurses as just regular people who get tired from over-working.
11000,And then tell the public to take precautions so hospitals don't get overwhelmed.
11001,"Instead, politicians treat doctors and nurses as comic book super-heroes."
11002,And then demand that the public party and go to festivals without masks.
11003,&gt;not stopping variants from happening.
11004,"We can't bring the chance of variants down to zero, but we can drastically decrease the likelihood by vaccinating as many people as possible, especially in third world countries."
11005,Although I'm still pretty scared of what the animal kingdom is cooking up for us.
11006,"Climate change and human encroachment is bringing animals and humans closer together, thus creating more opportunities for these type of diseases."
11007,And we've done FUCK ALL to curb China's wetmarkets and other disgusting stuff they do there with animals.

11019,It’s a little frustrating.
11020,"If you try and have a level headed debate with an unvaccinated person, other people (often vaccinated) come in and try to end the conversation with “everyone is entitled to their own choice” and try to immediately change the topic."
11021,"I get we’re all sick of talking about it, but that won’t make it go away."
11022,And coddling unvaccinated people or placating them for their choices won’t help them much either.

11033,I’m sure a small percentage of people have gotten this without providing true information since no system is perfect but 99.99% of the people that have been vaccinated in this country are in a database with accurate tracking information regarding their vaccinations.

11101,After Lollapalooza this seems prudent.
11102,It looks kinda like Georgia killed off enough of their own to flip the state.

11109,Over 96% of doctors in the US are vaccinated.

11111,I did just read you're 50% less likely to get it vaxxed.
11112,SO I guess that is some encouragement.
11113,50% is still a pretty significant number..heads or tails on if I get it or not.
11114,Idk.

11134,You are asking if getting COVID is the same as getting the vaccine.
11135,"But if you’ve recovered from Covid, that isn’t really the question, is it?"

11225,I seen someone wearing it over their nose only .....  mouth agape.
11226,lol
11227,Can’t squeeze blood from a stone.
11228,With some states having as little as a 2 year statute of limitations on medical debt so long as you weren’t worried about your credit rating you could simply dodge the debt for two years and there really wouldn’t anything they could do to collect it.
11229,Im in a similar position.
11230,"Fortunately,  it sounds like the vaccines are really still very effective overall."
11231,Our position just means we need to wait until the little ones can get vaccinated before we can start our return to normal.
11232,"The next hurdle, since it sounds like this will be endemic, is to hope exposure after being vaccinated continues to be no big deal and minimizes long covid."
11233,"At any rate, know you're not alone as we continue to try and hold out for the little ones."
11234,This might be of little value to you.
11235,But ive been in close contact with lots of sick people over the last 18 months and with a little extra caution and an N95 managed to not get sick and have relatively few worries about bringing it home.
11236,I hope you are somewhere that will allow masks.
11237,"I mean are we surprised, there is a major event being hosted and lots of celebration with people from all over the world."
11238,"And establish a time line, what does it mean ""required""."
11239,Who is exempt?
11240,How is exemption established?
11241,If a person can be exempt what does that mean?
11242,That is what the military is bracing for.
11243,There is going to be some pushback and dealing with that is a challange.
11244,"
&gt;In Texas, masks aren't mandatory so barely anyone wears one."
11245,"Even in the airport, because federal mandates mean nothing to people who probably already don't follow any precautions"
11246,Well…yeah!
11247,No shit.
11248,Those are the people not worried about COVID to begin with.
11249,Does anyone think that people who don’t want the vaccine are being cautious and careful by wearing a mask?
11250,Many people are done now because restrictions are largely lifted but mask wearing has always been very good from what I’ve seen though admittedly not as good now as it was.
11251,"But during lockdowns people where very good at following the rules and I do see the vast majority wear masks, I have family in Italy, visited Belgium recently and am myself from Europe and all 3 places have been good from what I seen/heard."
11252,I think there is a factor not really appriciated here.
11253,"Before vax the ”no fear, just a flu”-crowd were sheltered by the compliant masses yielding less viral loads and less/shorter exposure."
11254,"Yes, the anti-vaxxers were in large protected by everyone else following mandates and recommendations."
11255,"Now, with vaccines and Delta, that ship has sailed."
11256,They are on their own.

This bizarre religiosity is also the symptom of a much larger problem, namely the abject failure of American-style capitalism to provide for the safety and well-being of much of the populace."
11280,"I think the adenovirus based vaccines pose a small risk, but not mRNA vaccines."
11281,"From the article: “The CDC estimated unvaccinated people are eight times as likely to get the virus and experience disease symptoms, 25 times as likely to be hospitalized, and 24 times as likely to die, compared to people who are vaccinated.” 

Hospitalizations are high in FL because of DeSantis’ lack of proper response to the pandemic."
11282,Only 48% of eligible Floridians are vaccinated.
11283,"That, along with a refusal to wear masks, is why your rate as well as that of TX et al are climbing so fast &amp; why you are seeing so many hospitalizations."
11284,"In MA, where there is 72% fully vaccinated, there was an big outbreak of the delta variant in Provincetown."
11285,Some were vaccinated; none of them were hospitalized; the serious cases were among the unvaccinated.
11286,We were never promised that the vaccine was 100% effective.
11287,"Just as with the flu vaccine, you can expect not to get seriously ill (unless you have other serious medical conditions) or die."
11288,The governor has done everything in his power to cover up the real numbers.
11289,It’s always been bad in Florida.
11290,Just Google “Florida delta variant” and you will see the truth.
11291,Many of the hospitals in the bigger cities are already full.
11292,It was the number of people he had there that was the issue
11293,"&gt;Tone of this article is very optimistic, which belies the actual findings."
11294,For a UK publication it makes sense.
11295,Cases are declining following a huge delta wave despite all legal restrictions being removed.
11296,"The general view in the UK is that Covid, including Delta, is now a manageable fact of life."
11297,Research says we need boosters?
11298,"Meh, get us some boosters... We already ordered them in April?"
11299,Even better!

11314,"Somehow the initial results against native variant set the bar really, really high in most people's minds."
11315,"One year ago we were just *hoping* for *any* vaccine that would have around 60% efficacy, that was the bar to clear for approval."
11316,"Which, coincidentally, this is roughly what we are getting today against delta."
11317,The main problem is that for a while it looked like getting vaccinated was the end of it (and probably would have been against alpha).
11318,"Now turns that you must vaccinate, and also take some care."
11319,"And that is what leads many to say ""really low""."
11320,"For fucks sake, service members are often inoculated against ***WAY*** scarier shit (e.g."

11367,Both for his main job and his holiday season weekend job.
11368,"Pre-vaccine, he was wearing N99 masks with disposable surgical masks over them to cover the air valves."
11369,"After we were vaccinated in March, he started wearing cloth masks to continue to comply with corporate policy at his main job, but we weren't really concerned about it because we were vaccinated."
11370,But now?
11371,He's wearing N95 masks on the brief occasions when he has to deal with other people at his main job and when the seasonal weekend job starts back up (significantly more face to face contact with the public) he's going back to the N99s.

11446,At this point he's trying to dig his way out of looking dumb.
11447,"He only cares about being able to say he was right, and everyone else was wrong."

11449,Ask Halliburton.
11450,"Thank you, but why is it different with covid?"
11451,I'm reading they are thinking 80% might be the herd immunity percentage now due to delta.
11452,I'd be interested in seeing some experts discuss that.
11453,Who cares?

11469,They have seen a big uptick in the amount of RSV cases recently.

11471,The pandemic is the CDC's 9/11 and have not done well.
11472,Except that Israel was only looking at Pfizer while the UK’s study includes AZ.
11473,It’s not a direct comparison and doesn’t necessarily confirm the Israeli numbers.
11474,If it's outdoors and there's a mandatory vaccine check why was the size an issue?
11475,Can we never have large events again?

11483,Shut up.
11484,I think encouragement is very important during these times.
11485,"No shit, did they think unvaccinated were going back to masks when these people refused to wear one the entire time?"
11486,"Now they’re affirmed even more in their beliefs, and I get taunting of “haha, you’re vaccinated and still have to wear a mask!” and “what’s even the point of the vaccine?”  Mask mandates aren’t the answer, the only one now is proof of vaccination to be employed/be in indoor public spaces."

11531,Desantis isn’t on them.
11532,"Totally get 4, but this will most likely be controlled by booster shots that are quickly developed like yearly flu shots."
11533,So I’m not concerned with that.
11534,"1 and 3, the odds are pretty darn low of getting a severe case as a vaccinated person."
11535,Low enough that’s it’s not even realistically worth worrying about.
11536,"For 2, agains most people don’t have immunocompromised children."
11537,I know it happens and those people are in a rough situation and will be probably forever until their kids are old enough to receive the vaccine or the age limit is lowered for the vaccine.
11538,But other than those people I’d say the pandemic is over for vaccinated people and not worth worrying about anymore.
11539,Photo of your vaccine card on your phone that matches your ID.
11540,Also there are at least some places that are launching digital verification.
11541,I live in LA and now have a digital pass in my Apple wallet that has my vaccine details.
11542,Putting “tested” in quotes is probably talking about the data that normally wouldn’t be collected from having rolled it out to so many people before approval.
11543,There is still a difference between emergency use and a full standard FDA approval.
11544,"Sure, people who were never going to get the vaccine are full of shit when they say they’re waiting for approval."
11545,But plenty of people are just hesitant and a full on approval eases some of that hesitation.
11546,Arguing word games isn’t going to win _those_ people over.

11553,"I think for all of us, to whatever extent we have been friends with people who Trump-voted (or voted for DeSantis in your case), we are liable for what that leadership brings to our polities."
11554,"A nation or state is defined by what its people deem acceptable more than anything else, and anyone who Trump-friends has decided that choosing deaths over poor optics is acceptable political behavior."
11555,"That is what I hope, above all, the events of the last few years can bring us."
11556,"Viruses happen, and they can be bad news, but they aren’t evil and they aren’t the enemy like other human beings are."
11557,Who's on First!
11558,"Wait, what is it U.S. is being scheduled with 2 weeks in between?"
11559,"Pfizer has generally been 3, Moderna 4."
11560,Pfizer was 4 fo r a while but then they made it 3.
11561,You can delay but I couldn't even make my place give it one day early for my schedule.
11562,"There are people who see it as ""this is the thing I'm told to wear,"" like a hat or a wristband, part of a uniform."
11563,They don't really grasp what the purpose is because they're just thinking of it as a thing they're supposed to wear during pandemic.
11564,How will I ever get through the day

11590,I didn't know that it stopped any infection entirely.

11592,"Yay for Canada xD, but what about this: in the real world those 1000 people aren’t homogeneously distributed in age."
11593,There’s a portion that’s way more likely to die from covid.
11594,"If we could vaccinate half the population, and specifically those that are much more at risk then we have many more deaths prevented than if we just used one dose at a reduced level of protection."
11595,"And then as vaccine production ramps up, we get to the rest."
11596,"I think both approaches have their validity, but is one really better than the other at preventing deaths?"
11597,Perhaps the question is whose deaths are we trying to prevent…

11608,"It's much less likely for them, but it's still possible, just as it's less likely for them to get severe reactions, but it's still possible."
11609,And with anti-vax people filling up hospitals again it's not a good time to be one of those outliers.
11610,Any country is free to make deals with the vaccine companies if they want vaccines faster and have enough that they are willing to trade.
11611,My country literally forced certain companies to prioritize production of materials related to vaccines in order to get vaccines faster.
11612,Other countries could consider doing similar things if they wish.
11613,My country has also donated/is in the process of donating over a hundred million doses to other countries - how horrible of us if we choose to produce a little more to protect our residents more.

11622,"If you’re in the US, then the relevant Supreme Court decision on mandatory vaccination is Jacobson v. Massachusetts."
11623,Of course the US Army could defeat any rebellious force if it really wanted to.

11625,"Without guns, the US military could easily dispose of any serious rebellions very quickly without significant infrastructure damage."
11626,"With guns, however, the Military needs more support and would have to destroy large portions of American infrastructure."
11627,They can't go on-foot and kill 50 million or so armed Americans.
11628,"They would need missiles, air support, etc."
11629,to do so.

11665,We/Reddit/everyone are reaching overload.
11666,I saw a post earlier today about detection of a “Delta-plus” variant.

11670,Reddit will Reddit.
11671,"&gt; “If we don’t crush the outbreak to the point of getting the overwhelming proportion of the population vaccinated, then what will happen is the virus will continue to smolder through the fall into the winter, giving it ample chance to get a variant which, quite frankly, we’re very lucky that the vaccines that we have now do very well against the variants — particularly against severe illness,” Fauci said."
11672,“We’re very fortunate that that’s the case.
11673,"There could be a variant that’s lingering out there that can push aside delta.”

I still think it's misleading to tell people that if they crush the outbreak in their country, that will somehow prevent a vaccine-escape variant from emerging."
11674,Mutations happen randomly (and not always in places with high transmission) and there's nothing one country can do about stopping them: Vietnam wasn't spared from Delta because they kept COVID out for all of 2020.
11675,"If the virus is crushed everywhere in the world -- no humans are getting it, no animal reservoirs -- then, yeah, an escape variant will never happen."
11676,"Other than that, ending an outbreak is about ending an outbreak, not stopping variants from happening."

11694,The efficacy of the mRNA vaccines didn’t go through trials for the delta variant.
11695,That wasn’t the target.
11696,The fact that they have provided such high levels of protection is a definite plus.
11697,"So whether the booster is simply a third shot of what was provided before, or a new shot of a vaccine that was also designed and tested against the delta variant becomes a question in my mind."
11698,"Additionally, you now have the WHO asking for a moritorium against boosters until more people have the chance to get at least a single dose."
11699,Is it the US’s responsibility to permanently send vaccinations to poorer countries though in the long term is a question I think will become contentious down the line.

11712,You sound very emotional.
11713,"I see, you work for the government which explains why you don’t understand what’s happening."
11714,What I’m really saying is that there is no trust for public health officials anymore amongst the unvaccinated.
11715,So it also makes sense they don’t mask or do anything that was recommended.
11716,"If they first say “If you have the vaccine you don’t need to mask” then there are breakthrough cases, and now vaccinated people need to mask, then what evidence will come out next showing they were wrong again?"
11717,"I’m not antivax, I have all of my vaccines and I think you’re dumb if you don’t get the vaccine, but you’re also dumb if you don’t see and understand the incompetency of how this entire pandemic was handled by the government and public health officials."
11718,&gt;even the cdc says you should wait up to 6 weeks for the same dose if your previous brand isn't available.
11719,"That's because the CDC doesn't want you mixing at all, and they want you to wait as long as you can for supply to become available of the same brand."
11720,Look at US for a sec.
11721,Vaccinations have just stopped for months baecause the infections have decreased most likely due to the weather.

People tend to be reactive rather than pro-active unfortunately."

11727,There used to be a major urban/rural divide on this.
11728,As there is with so many other issues and topics.
11729,Mask usage was very high the closer you were to Dallas or San Antonio or Austin.
11730,But go thirty minutes outside to places like Terrell or Boerne or Bastrop and it was spotty at best; head out in to the hills to places like Brady or Brownwood or Mexia or Ozona and it was practically non-existent.
11731,And this was when there were mandates and pre-vaccine and Texans were falling dead left and right.
11732,"Nowadays, pretty much most everyone has forgone the mask in Texas - urban or rural."
11733,"In cities, there are still some using them - but I would estimate it's something like 30% at best."
11734,"Anywhere outside the city, all the signs have been scratched off the doors, and there's rarely a mask in sight any more."
11735,Not crazy about that - I'm still wearing my mask regardless if I'm the only one in the QT or 7-11 wearing one.
11736,"But that's the reality of what people are doing now, and I don't think there's much of anything that will be able to move the needle one way or the other at this point."
11737,"People are hard-set in their opinions, just like the political divide there's almost no ""middle ground"", and ""swayable"" moderates."
11738,"And it's so much a shame that it turned out this way, because if everything was handled better at the very beginning in early 2020, we wouldn't have such a hard set group of people against everything."
11739,But it's not like we can go back and change how various federal officials and governors reacted poorly in the past.

11771,By work do you mean masks and lockdowns again?
11772,A study showing the vaccinated are getting delta and spreading it?
11773,(Massachusetts refer to the CDC website) that study is what prompted the CDC to recommend masks for the vaccinated again.
11774,I thought one of the main points of the vaccine was to limit transmission which would in turn limit the spread and possibility of mutation.
11775,Why is one of the most vaccinated countries in the world contemplating lockdowns?

11971,"Further, if the vaccination rate in the US is indeed 70% now, and then you combine that with another chunk of individuals who have natural immunity from getting the actual virus, we should not be seeing this massive spike in cases."
11972,Historical data for herd immunity has been 60-80%.
11973,"We are well within the upper limit of that target range, and while it is still transmissible with herd immunity, there is no way we should see the exponential increases in cases that we’re seeing if the vaccinations are truly as effective as they’re saying."

11980,But your problem is you already got a second shot in MA.
11981,Let's say state bureaucracy makes it hard for you to use the MA shot to count as your second shot.
11982,What do you do now?
11983,Do you go ahead and take another shot in NY (this would be your third)?

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Vaccinations are a better predictor of [political beliefs than] than education, racial composition, or almost any other demographic factor (Source is the Denver Post June 25, 2021 -- can't be linked due to automod)

The correlation between vaccination and your beliefs is 0.85 That doesn't come from people ""doing research"" or having a contraindication."
12027,&gt;i wont want to be injected with some weird new shit.
12028,"There is nothing new or weird about it at this point, hundreds of millions of people have been vaxed, some for over a year."
12029,Some studies on mRNA vaccination have been ongoing for 20 years.
12030,&gt; i would like if people would stop trying to force vaccinations.

12032,It really spoils my buzz.
12033,"However, me enjoying a nice driver after a dozen beers isn't in public interest because it puts other people's lives at risk."
12034,Globally I think only 2 billion vaccines have been administered.
12035,If that info is wrong I'm open to being corrected.
12036,"But of the 8 billion people on earth, how many are eligible for the vaccine (I assume about 6.5 billion maybe), and how many of them are actually vaccinated fully?"

12132,the UK had a 3 month period between shots for most people right?
12133,Very possible that's causing the dip... that a three month gap between shots gives you a stronger immunity response than say 21 days between shots.
12134,can i see your papers?
12135,And we have EUA process to act as a surrogate approval because the  BLA process moves slower than a pandemic.

12148,I’m holding out and seeing if he suggests different after it’s FDA.

12444,It's actually exceedingly rare for someone to fall into a category where the vaccine is not recommended based on the risks/benefits.
12445,The US got at or very close to 10 thousand cases a day.....contact tracing would have been doable at the point and then it could have been kept up if taken seriously from that point forward.

12455,"This dude thinks hes doing the right thing avoiding the miniscule chance his kid gets ""long covid"", but by doing this he is permanently stunting her social developing which is far worse than any long covid symptom because even those, minus the most extreme cases, have been shown to NOT be permanent."

12457,Haha no way.

12479,"If two doses are more effective than one, then wouldn’t having a larger proportion of double vaccinated people save more lives, at least in the short term?"
12480,Not sure how increasing the gap could save more lives (against a more transmissible variant)
12481,It doesn’t matter what I say.
12482,It matters what science says.

12484,I’m not sure if you’re aware but when it comes to new information it’s typically publically available.
12485,I’d ask the doctor why he’s still hesitant and to show the evidence that led him there.
12486,"I’ve done this with doctors before and surprise, not all doctors have infallible logic or keep up to date on scientific findings"
12487,I don’t know what you think GBS is but it’s definitely not mild cold symptoms.

12543,"Despite our yearnings to be done with it, we’re in a long-haul crisis with COVID-19 — with a lot of moving parts and lots of opportunities for various individuals and institutions to prove themselves winners or losers in this battle."
12544,Consider the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and its inability to communicate clearly.
12545,This agency simply must figure out how to deliver a coherent message — especially now that every unvaccinated person is a walking petri dish for the virus’ next variant.
12546,"The CDC’s latest fuzzy language around why even vaccinated individuals should resume mask-wearing has provided the anti-vax crowd with an easy “See, shot doesn’t work” soundbite."
12547,"My own profession also deserves criticism for recent coverage, particularly those headlines that (gasp!)"
12548,"proclaim that “more than 125,000 vaccinated individuals have caught COVID.”

Indeed, the “breakthrough” number is that high — if not higher — and while most of the cases are mild, they are no less scary."
12549,"But 125,000 infections is less than one-tenth of one percentage point of the 165 million fully vaccinated people."

The number that deserves our concern is the 93 million or so people in the U.S. who are eligible for the vaccine but have chosen not to get it, despite the more easily transmittable delta variant in our midst."
12553,"Then there’s our own Greg Abbott, who might as well be running for reelection on the slogan of “worst governor since Pa Ferguson.”

Long gone is the Greg Abbott who showed considerable political courage in the first months of COVID."
12554,"Fearful of being out-flanked from the right in next year’s gubernatorial primary, he is doing what he must know is wrong for Texans because he desperately wants to win another term."
12555,"Abbott’s latest misfire in the name of opportunistic politics came late last week when, doubling down on his personal responsibility mantra, he issued a sweeping executive order that bans mask requirements by governments and public school systems and outlaws vaccine requirements by anyone receiving public funds."
12556,The governor may be sleeping better now that he’s repelled the accusations of two primary foes who accuse him of government overreach.
12557,"The rest of us, not so much."
12558,Abbott has tied the hands of every local leader in Texas from making the best decisions for those they serve.
12559,Among those most affected in North Texas are the sick and vulnerable patients at Parkland Memorial Hospital and its satellite clinics.
12560,Parkland would very much like to follow the lead of the many hospital systems across the state that have made vaccines mandatory for all staff.
12561,"After all, people ill enough to be in a hospital bed are at greater risk of both acquiring COVID and suffering a bad outcome if they do."

12573,"Abbott’s gamble may provide that 2022 primary victory, but words such as “unwise” and “opportunistic” will be his pandemic legacy."
12574,"Since we can’t change the governor’s mind, here’s what we can control:

Each of us has access to infinitely greater protection than we did a year ago."
12575,"Every single person, no matter how poor, has the immediate means to dramatically minimize his or her risk — by getting a shot."
12576,"It’s also worth remembering that the modest winners in this ongoing saga will be the adapters: Those who can accept that, because the known facts change from day to day, the response has to be tailored to meet conditions."
12577,"We’re still not very good at this — too often opting to the extremes of “carry an umbrella everywhere for the rest of my life because it’s raining today” or “don’t even own an umbrella because it’s not raining today.”

Should we all be wearing masks again?"
12579,"How to cope as COVID delta variant spreads in North Texas
BY SHARON GRIGSBY
I’m intent on continuing to find that middle way, which for me means wearing a mask right now in public."
12580,I’m doing so just on the chance that — even vaccinated but unmasked — I might catch enough of the delta virus load to unknowingly pass it along to someone else.
12581,"It’s true that I find it more than a little galling that, in essence, my mask is largely to protect the unvaccinated."
12582,But I choose to think about the tiny subset of people whose medical conditions preclude vaccination.
12583,"I think about those who are immunocompromised, for whom the vaccine might not be as effective."
12584,I also think about all the children under 12 who aren’t eligible for a vaccination.
12585,"Their risk of severe illness is low, but why wouldn’t I do my part to reduce their parents’ anxiety?"
12586,"Most of all, I think about the oldest among us for whom contracting a breakthrough infection is far more dangerous than it is for the rest of us."
12587,"And I say another prayer for my longtime friend, 93-year-old Evelyn Willey."
12588,"Many people in Dallas remember Evelyn, the spunky mother of former Dallas Morning News editorial page editor Keven Ann Willey who was so often at her daughter’s side during Keven’s 15 years of leadership here."
12589,"In the blink of an eye late last week, COVID struck Evelyn at her still-new retirement community residence in Tucson."
12590,"She called Keven with slurred speech, a terrible cough and difficulty completing a thought."
12591,Evelyn got lucky.
12592,Her doctor was able to quickly arrange a monoclonal antibody infusion and mom and daughter are now in isolation in Keven’s Tucson home.
12593,"Not even Kev’s husband, Georges, is allowed in."
12594,Keven told me Monday that she swings between all-consuming worry about her mom to fury over those who could get the shot — but won’t.
12595,"Seeing Evelyn become so sick after all the precautions the family has taken for the past 18 months is excruciating, Keven said."
12596,So much about this pandemic is maddeningly complex and contradictory.
12597,"One thing is not: The more vaccinated Americans, the less the virus can spread."
12598,"“The fear, pain and loss that people who refuse the vaccine are imposing on others is callously irresponsible,” Keven said."
12599,Let’s hope it doesn’t take COVID mutating into a strain immune to current vaccines before people get that message.
12600,Are they doing zoom concerts?
12601,Also your edited stats are wrong and you’re arguing against yourself.

12737,imagine if a country can expose their population gradually to the virus (of course under medical supervision).

12752,He claims that his doctor says that it is safer for him to get the virus than getting the vaccine???
12753,"Like I'm not going to pretend to be an expert on GBS, but there is no fucking way I believe that the vaccine is capable of triggering it, but the virus itself wouldn't be capable."
12754,This just seems like he is anti-vaxx but wants to make an excuse especially because he literally defends not getting the vaccine even if you are totally healthy.
12755,Actually I misspoke.

12776,"If his doctor is recommending against it, then I question the reasoning, but I don't think that a doctor's recommendation should be thrown out unless there's actually no merit to their reasoning."

12778,"I suffer from a form of IBD, and while the immunosuppresants I'm on have been shown to dramatically decrease antibody count generated from the COVID vaccine (though it's unclear how that correlates to efficacy), I still got it regardless."
12779,"Unfortunately, I'll be on immunosuppressants for the rest of my life, so I don't really get any advantage by waiting on it."
12780,"GBS is obviously different in this case though, as the concern is about reactions with the vaccines, and not necessarily with efficacy."
12781,"TL;DR, I don't agree that he should be advised against getting an mRNA vaccine if there has been no link to abnormal reactions in people with GBS."

12848,That's not correct.
12849,Vaccine efficacy doesn't compare total chances; rather it compares relative chances.
12850,90% efficacy is 1/10th relative chance whether the actual actual chance is high or low.

12871,"I mean having one week of crowded dance party´s, wild gay sex with unknown strangers every night will most likely give you worse things than Covid."

12888,I'd wager the unvaccinated are less scared of big crowds unfortunately.
12889,However I'd guess 80-90% of the folks in attendance here were likely vaccinated given the demographics

12898,And TN shut down their pandemic unemployment.
12899,Except the fact that efficacy compares the total chances of the two groups which as you said is then dependent on other variables.

12921,The difference is only statistically significant with one of the three assays that they used.
12922,And there is a large drop in antibody levels after 4 weeks from the second dose.
12923,"It's not clear if that renders the possible advantage of the 5-week-between-doses strategy irrelevant at that point, since the data is not granular."
12924,"If he's in such ill health that he claims he can't get the vaccine, he shouldn't be out and about risking another possibly worse COVID infection."

13391,"**Article**  


Full vaccination halves the transmission of the Delta variant of coronavirus and is 60 per cent effective at preventing symptoms of Covid-19, according to Imperial College’s latest React-1 prevalence survey."
13392,"The findings, released on Wednesday and based on a study of 98,000 volunteers in England, provide the most extensive community evidence so far of the way vaccines protect against Delta, which originated in India and has completely displaced the earlier Alpha variant in the UK since the beginning of April."
13393,Recent studies have shown 90 per cent vaccine effectiveness in preventing hospitalisation with Delta.
13394,"In React-1, 40 per cent of participants testing positive were asymptomatic and many others had very mild symptoms."
13395,Effectiveness estimates always decrease as researchers include less serious disease.
13396,"“Vaccination remains highly effective against Delta,” said Imperial’s Paul Elliott, co-leader of the project."
13397,"React-1, which has been running since April 2020, provides monthly snapshots of Covid by testing random samples of people across England."
13398,"During the latest survey, from June 24 to July 12, prevalence of infection, at 0.63 per cent, was four times higher than during the previous round from May 20 to June 7."
13399,The spread was starting to slow at the end of the sampling period but the study stopped too soon to catch the recent rapid fall in Covid cases.
13400,"“The Delta variant made up 100 per cent of the latest sample,” said Steven Riley, the study’s other co-leader."
13401,"“We did not pick up any of the more worrying sub-lineages of Delta.”  
This is the first time React-1 has estimated vaccine effectiveness."
13402,The analysis included both AstraZeneca and Pfizer vaccines but did not break down the figures for each jab.
13403,"“The findings, when coupled with other studies demonstrating the impact of coronavirus vaccines on reducing hospitalisation and death from Covid-19, are encouraging,” said Tom Wingfield, senior clinical lecturer at Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine."
13404,"“However, \[they\] also serve as a reminder that, even with extremely high vaccine coverage, we are highly likely to have a further wave of infections in the autumn.”  
A separate UK study, released on Tuesday night, gave reassuring results about “long Covid” in children."
13405,"Researchers at King’s College London studied 1,734 children aged five to 17 who showed Covid symptoms and a positive test."
13406,They found that symptoms lasted for four or more weeks in 4.4 per cent of their group and for more than eight weeks in just 1.8 per cent.
13407,These figures are well below the 10 to 20 per cent levels frequently reported for adults with long Covid.
13408,"The symptoms reported most commonly in children were headaches, fatigue and sore throat."
13409,"“Many children who catch coronavirus don’t show any symptoms at all, and it will be reassuring for families to know that those children who do fall ill with Covid-19 are unlikely to suffer prolonged effects,” said Emma Duncan, senior author of the study which was published in The Lancet Child and Adolescent Health."
13410,"“Our research confirms that a small number do have a long illness duration with Covid-19, though these children too usually recover with time.”  
“The most important finding is the low proportion that had persistent symptoms, the great majority of whom recovered by two months after illness,” said Russell Viner, professor of child and adolescent health at University College London."
13411,“This is much lower than reported in some other studies and is reassuring about the population burden of post-Covid symptoms in children and young people.”

13418,The figures can only be used for drawing comparisons between vaccines.
13419,A background case *prevalence* would be useful to draw some conclusion about *efficacy* though..
13420,I don't know what this is and the prevalence is likely to differ for each vaccination group.
13421,Also if the lead singer as a molecular biologist still kicked him out .
13422,..
13423,So he could still get GBS if he manages to contract the virus or am I reading how you contract it wrong?
13424,And &gt;99% of COVID deaths right now are amongst unvaccinated individuals.

13492,Deaths have not increased in fact they have decreased for some reason meanwhile most other states with surges show deaths increasing.
13493,I think there is most likely a delay in reporting deaths.
13494,If you kook at Arkansas and Louisiana the same thing happened until they just released a big one day increase in deaths.
13495,I still do not expect to see deaths reach previous peaks because younger pts are being hospitalized due to very low vaccination rates in their age group.
13496,I don't know if you are serious or not.

- My sister’s boss, her parents, and her grandparents (all of whom are fully vaxxed) were all exposed because her brother (unvaxxed) tested positive for COVID after he was around them for a birthday dinner."

13825,He had commented on not feeling well that day but they thought nothing of it.

13834,Bam.
13835,Positive result the next day.
13836,Mum was exposed - tested negative.
13837,- A vaxxed teacher friend had one of the students in her class test positive.

14193,"**Article**

Although most children with Covid-19 recover within a week, a small percentage experience long-term symptoms, according to a new study of more than 1,700 British children."
14194,"The researchers found that 4.4 percent of children have symptoms that last four weeks or longer, while 1.8 percent have symptoms that last for eight weeks or longer."
14195,The findings suggest that what has sometimes been called “long Covid” may be less common in children than adults.
14196,"In a previous study, some of the same researchers found that 13.3 percent of adults with Covid-19 had symptoms that lasted at least four weeks and 4.5 percent had symptoms that lasted at least eight weeks."
14197,"“It is reassuring that the number of children experiencing long-lasting symptoms of Covid-19,” is low, Dr. Emma Duncan, an endocrinologist at King’s College London and lead author of the study, said in a statement."
14198,"“Nevertheless, a small number of children do experience long illness with Covid-19, and our study validates the experiences of these children and their families.”  
  
The study, published on Tuesday in the journal The Lancet Child &amp; Adolescent Health, is based on an analysis of data collected by the Covid Symptom Study smartphone app."
14199,"The paper focuses on 1,734 children between the ages of 5 and 17 who tested positive for the virus and developed symptoms between Sept. 1 and Jan. 24."
14200,Parents or caregivers reported the children’s symptoms in the app.
14201,"In most cases, the illness was mild and short."
14202,"Children were sick for six days, on average, and experienced an average of three symptoms."
14203,The most common symptoms were headache and fatigue.
14204,"But a small subset of children experienced lingering symptoms, including fatigue, headache and a loss of smell."
14205,Children between 12 and 17 were sicker for longer than younger children and more likely to experience symptoms that lasted at least four weeks.
14206,"“We hope our results will be useful and timely for doctors, parents and schools caring for these children — and of course the affected children themselves,” Dr. Duncan said."
14207,The researchers also compared children who tested positive for the coronavirus with those who reported symptoms in the app but tested negative for the virus.
14208,"Children who tested negative — and may have had other illnesses, such as colds or the flu — recovered more quickly and were less likely to have lingering symptoms than those with Covid."
14209,"They were ill for three days, on average, and just 0.9 percent of children had symptoms that lasted at least four weeks."
14210,"&gt; And it's not like I'm against science or the vaccine, but a mandate by the government?"
14211,There is no comparison to this in history.

14290,As you’ve been corrected the CDC emphatically says people who had it should still be vaccinated.
14291,Average.
14292,"So if 40% cares, 45% doesn't and 15% are indifferent, that still averages to don't care"
14293,"Okay, you can live in isolation forever and never set foot in a vehicle ."
14294,The damaging effects of isolation don’t seem to be of much concern to you.

14306,There was just a post/article the other day I think in the times of Israel that they were going to stop focusing on cases and use hospitalizations/hospital capacity as the metric by which they gauge policy.
14307,This and mask mandates and potential lockdowns I’m reading about in here doesn’t seem like that.

14309,Why do you think Bill Gates put the 5G nanobots into the vaccine?

14312,"Children might not be dying, but I haven't seen any studies on how sick they're getting, how much school, sports and socialising they're missing, whether there is long term damage to a young growing body."
14313,The death statistics are not the full picture to decide what to lockdown for.
14314,Nothing they said was inaccurate.
14315,"https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/faq.html

&gt;Yes, you should be vaccinated regardless of whether you already had COVID-19."
14316,That’s because experts do not yet know how long you are protected from getting sick again after recovering from COVID-19.
14317,"Even if you have already recovered from COVID-19, it is possible—although rare—that you could be infected with the virus that causes COVID-19 again."
14318,Studies have shown that vaccination provides a strong boost in protection in people who have recovered from COVID-19.

14328,"10 positives per 1000, not 100."

14334,That referred to masking and distancing in spring 2020 to avoid overwhelmimg hospitals— long before vaccines became available.
14335,The endpoint of the vaccine trials was symptomatic infection.
14336,"The trials weren’t even powered to evaluate effect on hospitalization or death, that would have taken much longer trials involving many more cases of Covid."

14364,"If you're referring to those studies showing ""viral loads"" are equivalent in vaccinated vs unvaccinated, take them with a handful of salt."
14365,These were measurements taken from nose/throat swabs.
14366,"Big problem throughout this pandemic is that a routine test to measure the ""load"" in the lungs does not exist."
14367,Lower respiratory tract load is likely to be far more relevant as a metric that determines infectiousness and very likely to be lower in vaccinated vs unvaccinated lungs.
14368,Georgia has the same executive order that prevents municipalities from creating mask mandates.
14369,Cities are just choosing to ignore that EO.

14376,"Apparently, acknowledging that acquired natural immunity from a previous infection exists is also a cardinal sin here."
14377,There's a stark detachment from reality and scientific reasoning there that I find hard to explain or grapple with.

14386,"Not my job or, anyone vaxxed for that matter, to protect people who have chosen not to become vaccinated anymore."
14387,"It’s time for everyone, vaxxed or unvaxxed, to assess their individual risk and wear a mask if they chose or don’t wear a mask if they chose."
14388,I am fortunate to still live in a county in California with no mask mandate and I certainly hope it stays that way.
14389,Yeah I think Florida wins the “makes for a good white paper on how not to pandemic” contest.
14390,Alabama gets a podium with Texas.
14391,"If not working in a COVID ward, then maybe he can spend some time in one some other way."
14392,In this case “disease” is defined as a positive covid case reported to the cdc.
14393,Whatever led to that happening.
14394,"What you seem to be are arguing is that asymptomatic infection rates *could* be unchanged in vaccinated people, but that’s just a guess."
14395,"What we know is if you pick a random vaccinated person in the u.s., their chance of having had a positive covid test is 8x less than an unvaccinated person."
14396,Put that shot down!!!
14397,I don't think Bennett will implement a lockdown.
14398,The goal of this government is to learn to live with covid.
14399,They are doing all they can including the 3rd boosters for 60+.
14400,The reason I dont think they will do a lockdown is that I think hospitalizations will be a fraction of what they were during the last wave.
14401,Also Isreal seems to be following the UK in cases by 33 days.
14402,Those cases seem to have peaked and Israel should see something similiar.
14403,"See Eran Segal, a scientific advisor for the government, on Twitter for optimistic news!!"

14405,Ok if you live in the US than we are done arguing since it blatantly is just bad faith.
14406,I have statistically proven you way wrong as well....
14407,They lucked out last year with contact tracing and lockdown.
14408,"While the world is moving to vaccines, the Communist government sits on their thumbs thinking that the same 2020 methods is going to work with the Delta variants and that they can wait for the vaccines craze to die down and get a good deal for vaccination later."

14419,Not even close and I will die on that hill any day.
14420,"Example, it would take me about 10 minutes to walk to about 4 different pharmacies in my area that have the vaccine."
14421,I think it would literally take me 3 hours to walk to my nearest DMV.
14422,What are you talking about?
14423,"“They’re making these decisions on the basis of extremely weak and unreliable data, and at the same time not doing the necessary work to reduce uncertainty among the population,” said Vinay Prasad, a physician and professor in the Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics at the University of California, San Francisco."
14424,"“When there isn’t a lot of study data, the CDC should be conducting these studies.”

A lot of people cave pointed out that the event in Provincetown is anomalous for various reasons."
14425,How do you know you didn't catch it?
14426,50% of people who catch it or asymptomatic with and without a vaccination.
14427,Did you get tested for antibodies regularly while out and about?
14428,Do you have medical documentation that shows you had no antibodies prior to getting your vaccine?
14429,If you can't answer these questions then you have no idea if you did or did not catch it or spread it.

Oh, yeah, that'll do, he's probably tried to explain it to no avail."
14441,It's much harder to identify reinfections than vaccine breakthrough cases.
14442,Studies have shown that vaccination leads to what is probably a better immune response (both antibodies and T cells) than infection.
14443,Therefore it makes sense that the risk of reinfection would be similar to or greater than the risk of a vaccine breakthrough case.
14444,"Exactly, we have to start leaning into the belief in the vaccines."

14462,Stop removing the incentives for getting the vaccine by telling the vaccinated that they’re potentially super spreaders.
14463,See you all at Firefly 2021.
14464,They shouldn’t be allowed to do that and life insurance companies should be able to deny claims if the person refused to get vaccinated

14515,So far their vaccines (including the much-maligned AstraZenica) have held up extremely well through this surge.

14894,The projection that Biden was senile was so obvious.
14895,So much this.
14896,As someone who works in the industry and is vaccinated...many of us would LOVE to get back to our jobs now that we are vaccinated.
14897,We were the first industry to close and are the last to reopen.
14898,Many folks lost their livelihoods over night.
14899,I am glad to see folks get some work again.
14900,I really hope to see more shows and music festivals require vaccines.

14902,Yeah that’s what did it for me.
14903,My GF and I bought tickets to Life Is Beautiful because we got vaccinated and was hoping that September was going to be enough time for everybody to get vaccinated.
14904,"Should've accounted for the damn anti-vaxxers -\_- 

I think I'm just going to get a booster shot and wear an N95 mask at the event."
14905,We did pay extra for VIP so that we could have some social distancing space.

14918,The risk to the rest of us is just breakthrough cases which are rare and not so serious.
14919,But why y’all gotta clog the hospitals and run up everyone’s insurance bill?
14920,Is it safe to say the worst of COVID is officially over?
14921,"Given that only unvaxxed are making up all the hospitalizations, this means the vaccine is highly effective

Further, UK’s and India quick decline with cases further supports the success of the vaccine."
14922,"So we all know COVID will be around for a while, but it’s safe to say the worst of it is over right?"
14923,"As the virus mutates it should become less and less deadly, especially with most of the world now probably being infected with covid atleast once."

14925,"Maybe mask mandates here and there, but there’s just no way covid can be so severe that we see another lockdown or recommendations for schools and work to go remote."
14926,"I think, despite the horrors seen in the unvaxxed, this is overall extremely good news knowing there is an effective vaccine out there that will put covid in the backseat for good"

14930,"From Holland’s Wikipedia 

&gt;	Holland was a doctoral student at the Laboratory of Viral Oncology and Proteomics Research, Keck School of Medicine, where he was supervised by Professor Suraiya Rasheed."
14931,"[13] In March 2013, Holland and co-authors published a paper in PLoS One regarding microRNA in HIV genomes,[14] titled ""Identification of Human MicroRNA-Like Sequences Embedded within the Protein-Encoding Genes of the Human Immunodeficiency Virus""."
14932,[15] The original academic paper describes the use of computational molecular biological (in silico) approaches to identify microRNA-like sequences in HIV.
14933,"These sequences are suggested to have evolved to self-regulate survival of the virus in the host by evading its immune responses and thus influence the persistence, replication, and pathogenicity of HIV."
14934,"Holland was awarded his Ph.D. degree in molecular biology during the USC Commencement on May 12, 2017."

14943,"You're arguing that with that many people, covid was not transferred because of testing."
14944,I'm gonna hard disagree with you.
14945,Going out to eat takes more time than that.
14946,"If they can afford to go out to eat, pay the babysitter for that time, and cover the cost of transport to go out to eat guess what?"
14947,They can afford to do all that to get the vaccine.

14978,&gt;	How does that first estimate work?
14979,Are they not accounting for the fact that the people who have gotten the vaccine are specifically the ones more likely to get a vaccine?
14980,"Bad wording on my part, it just means that by September, anyone down to get the vaccine will have the opportunity to do so."
14981,"&gt;	And even if everyone was down to get it

We’re close!"
14982,A recent survey showed that 94% of Brazilians age 16 and up wants to vaccinate or already got it.
14983,&gt;	it took 7 months to get 106 million done at a pretty steady rate.
14984,How are they going to do another 60+ million in one month?
14985,Our vaccination picked up a lot of speed since around April/May.
14986,"Just this month we have a forecast of 60 million doses of vaccine (30M from Pfizer, 20M from AstraZeneca and 10M from Sinovac)."
14987,Agreed.

14995,Very sad.
14996,"And it's not like I'm against science or the vaccine, but a mandate by the government?"
14997,There is no comparison to this in history.
14998,There are a couple of factors.
14999,"First, health care is much more expensive in the US than most other countries."
15000,"Second, it’s really a bit early to say that there are no long term effects."
15001,There probably aren’t but we don’t know if this is another shingles type of scenario.

15010,"Again, you can dislike something, but that doesn’t mean you get to say it’s illegal because you don’t like it."
15011,"It’s actually firmly grounded in science and months of data in vaccine efficacy trials, which show vaccination slashes chances of hospitalizations and deaths."

15029,The 30% of adults who haven’t gotten a vaccine?
15030,It’s pretty obvious.
15031,It doesn’t apply to 12 and under per the announcement and articles.
15032,The point of this policy and what was directly stated by the mayor was to incentivize vaccination for those who have not gotten the vaccine yet.
15033,"It’s not to have 100% enforcement, be perfect, or not be cheated.. it’s to spur another 10% of the adult population to get vaccinated."
15034,No it literally is not.
15035,"Banning right to assembly without reason would be, banning huge assembly *because of a virus that at the time was new and uncontrolled* is not."
15036,The same thing was done during the Spanish flu outbreak.
15037,"If the goal was to stop people from worshipping or sharing ideas, zoom church meetings, parking lot church meetings, Facebook groups and political activity online would be banned."
15038,That wasn’t the case.
15039,"Not being able to do something for a period of time sucks, but it isn’t a violation of your rights if there’s a valid reason for it."
15040,"On the duration of immunity: Yes, and...?"
15041,"Those are both finite amounts of time, the very definition of the word 'temporary'."
15042,"I will certainly agree that a 3rd dose booster shot is looking increasingly like a good idea, and almost certainly we'll need sooner or later just to maintain the protection from the first set of shots."
15043,"If we can boost protection levels even higher, I say we should."
15044,"As good as current vaccines are, I've seen outbreak reports from a naval group that had 100% vaccinated crew."
15045,"If the disease can survive in spread in that environment, we can still benefit from increased levels of protection in the general population."
15046,It doesn't say anything of the sort.
15047,It says some epidemiologists believe that the transition from pandemic-to-endemic will take anywhere from years to decades.
15048,"That's not bleak, it's just presenting a picture of how viruses, especially coronaviruses, evolve in relation to our immunological responses."
15049,"It says nothing about the stay-home, always-masked mode (which isn't the current situation anyway) continuing for years or decades."
15050,Anywhere.
15051,"*The good news, she said, is that nothing in the coronavirus’s recent evolution suggests it won’t eventually transition to being a mild endemic virus, joining the family of common cold-causing bugs."
15052,"That could change if new variants were to deal young kids much more severe cases of disease, or completely blindside the immune systems of people who’d been vaccinated or previously infected."
15053,"“Thankfully, at this point, both of those things are holding,” said Lavine.“So the light at the end of the tunnel for me is that the long-term picture still doesn’t look so bad, it’s just that it’s not this kind of ‘get to this magical threshold of vaccine coverage and it’s all over.’ It’s a slower progression with a less clear-cut end,” she said."
15054,“That doesn’t mean there’s not an end.
15055,"It’s just harder to see it definitely, and disappointing when it didn’t happen the way we were maybe led to believe.”*"
15056,Then he should stop being a damned moron
15057,"The vax has very rare instances of adverse reaction, shouldn’t be a controversial statement."
15058,"The cdc stopped the J&amp;J vax to investigate a few cases, remember?"
15059,"Very rare statistically, as are bad outcomes for child covid patients, but they still exist statistically."
15060,But that’s not even my point…which is that driving in a car is super dangerous relative to both those things
15061,Wow!!

You will find a handful of epidemiologists who've used (or been quoted as using) the word 'strain', but - again - the VAST majority of both still call it a variant."
15117,You need to take that up with them.
15118,"As for virologists, I've seen several who do believe that."
15119,But it's fair to say that they are generally more conservative in terms of the actual analysis of the virus itself rather than inferring based upon rate of spread and modelling.
15120,I think he's right here - there definitely is a tendency to be judgemental about people who've been unlucky enough to contract the virus  and it's not healthy.
15121,Death isn’t the only negative outcome idiot.

15128,"Basically situations where the vaccine has not been approved, unavailable, or with people for whom the vaccine is less likely to be effective or cannot be safely administered."

15165,"I can see cases taking off, but deaths will never be as crazy as they were in previous waves."
15166,CFR dropped by a factor of 15 in UK and even with less vaccine coverage among people 60+ (like in the US or GER) a reduction by a factor of 10 should be possible.
15167,I also assume deaths will remain at 90+ % unvaxxed people.
15168,The pandemic will mainly continue in unvaxxed social circles.
15169,These circles are probably still large enough to lead to pretty impressive outbreaks in terms of cases throughout fall.

15171,70% of adults isn't near enough to deal with the delta variant.
15172,It's also misleading.

Abstract  
Recent studies have shown a correlation between COVID-19, caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection, and the distinct, exaggerated immune response titled “cytokine storm”."
15877,"This immune response leads to excessive production and accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) that cause clinical signs characteristic of COVID-19 such as decreased oxygen saturation, alteration of hemoglobin properties, decreased nitric oxide (NO) bioavailability, vasoconstriction, elevated cytokines, cardiac and/or renal injury, enhanced D-dimer, leukocytosis, and an increased neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio."
15878,"Particularly, neutrophil myeloperoxidase (MPO) is thought to be especially abundant and, as a result, contributes substantially to oxidative stress and the pathophysiology of COVID-19."
15879,"Conversely, melatonin, a potent MPO inhibitor, has been noted for its anti-inflammatory, anti-oxidative, anti-apoptotic, and neuroprotective actions."
15880,"Melatonin has been proposed as a safe therapeutic agent for COVID-19 recently, having been given with a US Food and Drug Administration emergency authorized cocktail, REGEN-COV2, for management of COVID-19 progression."
15881,"This review distinctly highlights both how the destructive interactions of HOCl with tetrapyrrole rings may contribute to oxygen deficiency and hypoxia, vitamin B12 deficiency, NO deficiency, increased oxidative stress, and sleep disturbance, as well as how melatonin acts to prevent these events, thereby improving COVID-19 prognosis."
15882,"Early September is after most schools will have begun the school year, which will make mandating vaccines for students and staff very difficult."
15883,Nice timing guys.
15884,I would say yes.
15885,"I went to a smaller show (a few hundred people) Friday and two days later had a minor sore throat, today (Tuesday) a mild sinus infection and I went to get a covid test."
15886,"Won't know for 2 days, but I'm not rolling the dice again."
15887,"Yes, I am fully vaccinated since May."
15888,You know what they say about people who assume...
15889,What kind of a sick fuck proudly takes credit for 55 deaths a day?
15890,That's almost perfectly in line with the Pfizer effectiveness found in Canada and the UK.
15891,"Good news on the mixed dosing front, too, as South Korea found the lowest breakthrough rate with AZ+Pfizer than any other unmixed combination."
15892,"Oh, you mean where we went from an average of 35,000 a year to basically almost nothing?"
15893,"Turns out, everyone wearing masks almost entirely stopped the Flu!"

15897,Part of my reasoning has been that I trust my immune system to fight it off.
15898,"Back in January 2020, a lot of people were coming down with an unusually strong cold or flu."
15899,We actually had a worker in our building who went home TO WUHAN for Christmas vacation and then came back.
15900,I was one of the ones who came down with something.
15901,Deep congestion that lasted a long time.
15902,But I got over it.
15903,"And I haven't been sick since then, ostensibly being exposed to covid the whole time since, let's be honest, people don't follow the CDC guidelines as much as they say they do."
15904,"So basically I saw no need for me to introduce this new and potentially complicating substance into my body, and felt that if I came down with covid again I could just fight it off like I probably did before."
15905,The reason I'm leaning the other way now is simply because it doesn't seem like a big deal to take it so I might as well.
15906,I still don't think the CDC / WHO is being accurate or honest with its statistics.
15907,I don't trust them.
15908,"But it seems as though now the world is going to be divided into the vaxxed and the unvaxxed, and I have been so lonely these past 18 months that I know I couldn't take it being on the unvaxxed side."

Who Should NOT Get Vaccinated

If you have had a severe allergic reaction (anaphylaxis) or an immediate allergic reaction, even if it was not severe, to any ingredient in an mRNA COVID-19 vaccine (such as polyethylene glycol), you should not get either of the mRNA COVID-19 vaccines."
16081,"If you had a severe or immediate allergic reaction after getting the first dose of an mRNA COVID-19 vaccine, you should not get a second dose of either of the mRNA COVID-19 vaccines."

16224,People are having a misconception about vaccines- they don’t act as perfect protection.
16225,They notify your immune system to identify a bad invader.
16226,It’s like fore warning in an attack.

16357,Some deaths – particularly among the elderly – are associated with secondary complications of influenza (including bacterial pneumonias).
16358,Influenza virus infection may not be identified in many instances because influenza virus is only detectable for a short period of time and/or many people don’t seek medical care until after the first few days of acute illness.
16359,"For these and other reasons, statistical modeling strategies have been used to estimate seasonal flu-related deaths for many decades."

16371,I also wouldn't be surprised to see cases actually coming down in 3 weeks at this pace...
16372,We need a new Disney World somewhere normal...
16373,Not like the vaccine.
16374,That's why we closed gyms in 2020.
16375,"If you won't or can't get the vaccine, stay home."
16376,It's that simple.
16377,Where does the headline mention people being in the hospital?
16378,The headline is about the percentage of cases affected children.
16379,I think you're smart enough to figure out why it would be higher if vaccination rates were higher.
16380,Is this a reference to something?
16381,"Yeah, hard to tell."
16382,I share all of your concerns.
16383,"I just think this is sucky a quickly evolving situation, could have been changes based upon new information/etc."
16384,"from what I had read, sounded like they felt they had the dose figured out but wanted more safety data."
16385,"We tried to get all 3 of our kids in a trial, and missed getting a spot for the first two &amp; the youngest didn’t have any trial locations remotely close."
16386,I’m pro-vaccine and have the Pfizer.
16387,But at this point it doesn’t seem as effective at stopping Delta as they are saying.
16388,That's a relief.
16389,I hope all the people complaining about how the US isnt donating enough shots across the world really takes a second and thinks before demanding we start boosters for everyone.
16390,The US has wasted millions of shots.
16391,Boosters will mean 200 million shots.
16392,That has to come from somewhere.
16393,It means poor people in Africa and South America will suffer greatly.
16394,Better to only allow it for immunocompromised and the elderly.
16395,Not for all the 20/30 somethings that are sneaking into get a third shot.
16396,"I can deal with a sore arm, it’s the serious side effects that worry me."
16397,I don’t wanna go through covid again.
16398,"One of my relatives also had &amp; beat covid and when he got the vax, he said his side effects made him feel like he was on the verge of death."
16399,"And he got his vaccine only a month or two after recovery, so I don’t see why his side effects should have been so bad considering the (supposed) strength of his fresh antibodies."
16400,Americans try to understand that NYC is not the biggest metro area in the world challenge (failed)
16401,Florida has had one of the lowest rates of businesses going under since the pandemic started
16402,Are you making this distinction or your doctor?
16403,Delta variant enters the chat.
16404,The US was done too in many places but restrictions are coming back globally as the new variant spreads.
16405,Even China is admitting they have cases and are trying to control spread
16406,I don't know what the fuck to do anymore.
16407,My college is going back to full in-person classes and they aren't giving online stuff like last year so it's either go get fucking COVID or lose more progress when I'm already behind.
16408,My mental health has been regressing lately and I just feel like I'm about to collapse.
16409,"I have no support system and anyone I'm close with at this point, I'm incredibly lonely, and I just feel like this pandemic is regressing again and I'll be stuck like this forever."
16410,[removed]
16411,"Yea, especially with the few nut job parents trying to get schools to not mask."
16412,"Fuck those assholes, I don't want my kids getting sick before getting vaccinated."
16413,Especially when we're so close.
16414,It's like these morons want to go full remote again instead.
16415,Wouldn't herd immunity necessarily include the components of vaccinated and naturally immune?
16416,Those who are willing to get infected (unvaccinated) are contributing to the herd threshold.
16417,"The coverage in large cities is also higher than the 60% level, in Beijing it is probably close to 80%+, so even if the efficacy is 50-60%, the R0 is going to drop significantly due to that and when you add the restrictions, it is quite possible to make the virus die out."
16418,A morbid part of me would like them to finally feel the pain of their failure to contain it and their attempts to suppress the truth about it.
16419,But I know that wouldn’t be fair to the average Chinese person.
16420,"&gt;It could 

no not really."
16421,The idea that there could be long term side effects is just unfounded fear.
16422,There is no known mechanism that could cause long term side effects.
16423,The vaccine is destroyed in your body very quickly and after that happens the only thing left is your normal immune system with one additional immune response among the thousands it already has.
16424,Any adverse event from vaccination manifests within weeks.
16425,We've been vaccinating people for about two centuries and long-term side effects do not happen.
16426,"Logic, reason, known human biological function, centuries of evidence all support this position."
16427,If the claim is that mRNA is a new mechanism that isn't true either.
16428,There's been tens of thousands of different mRNA in your body every day of your life.
16429,It would be great to be able to authoritatively say that any long term side effect are absolutely impossible but there isn't any way of actually proving it.
16430,We also can't prove that if a human lives to 150years old they start aging backwards.
16431,We ca not prove it doesn't happen but nobody is running around saying *it could happen* like they do with long term side effects from vaccines.
16432,"It is way more likely that you wake up tomorrow as the richest person in the world, at least we know of some way that that could happen."
16433,"How long til gov heehaw is like ""the deaths are so low here!"""

16464,"Sometimes, they don't, but the times they do mutate advantageously, those variants are even more likely to spread!"
16465,"The more often these variants evolve, the more likely the vaccines that have been developed will be less effective against them because they're no longer the same virus!"
16466,Not caring about letting the virus spread is like being okay with a peeing section of the swimming pool.
16467,I'm an American living in the south.
16468,My state governor hasn't actually passed legislation banning mask mandates in schools (yet) like our neighboring states have.

16471,Her's is the ONLY one I know of in my city that is requiring masks when the kids are indoors.
16472,"So in large parts of the US, there isn't really a middle ground for parents to exist within."
16473,You either send them to overcrowded schools where less than half the occupants will be masked or you keep them home.

16491,"I just think if anyone, young or old, was dying from the flu in the thousands or tens of thousands every year it would be more memorable?"
16492,I could be wrong.
16493,Probably somewhere in between.

16637,I think it's just going to slowly fade out of the spotlight with each new wave.
16638,"Overall, people's behaviors during this year's Delta wave are not even close to the original response last year - masks are being **recommended** many places, but not mandated, and most people are sort of just doing their thing."
16639,"If there's another wave after this one, it will be given even less attention as the general public moves on to other things."
16640,Masks will just slowly be forgotten.
16641,"Part of the reason is pandemic fatigue, but also, the disease is just going to be less deadly."
16642,"More people will continue to be vaccinated or infected, leading to natural immunity, and deaths and hospitalizations will continue decoupling from the case count."

16683,"Once Pfizer is approved, that argument goes out the window."
16684,I hear that... its def been talked about but hopefully we're close.. like another month or two and this'll be behind us
16685,"Hell, I'll take both."
16686,And I have a huge needle phobia.
16687,People are being massive babies about this vaccine.
16688,Shocking.
16689,Turns out the current party in the WH isn't much different than the last.
16690,"&gt;Eventually they will have to test their vaccines, they don't work as well, according to most legitimate studies."
16691,"Yes, legitimate peer-reviewed studies say that [Sinovac's efficacy vs original strain in clinical trials in Turkey was 83.5%](https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736%2821%2901429-X/fulltext), [Sinovac's efficacy vs Gamma &amp; Lambda strains in the real-world study was 66%](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2107715), while [Sinopharm's two vaccines were found to have efficacies of 72.8% and 78.1% (vs original) in clinical trials in UAE &amp; Bahrain](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2780562)."
16692,"That's all vs symptomatic disease, for severe the numbers are even better."
16693,"They also have a single-shot adenovirus vector vaccine from Cansino with 65.9% efficacy, similar to J&amp;J."
16694,"So the vaccines are weaker than mRNA but on par\better with\than AstraZeneca, J&amp;J, and most other vaccines."
16695,"Maybe Sputnik is better but Russia is incapable of manufacturing enough of them with countries already canceling their orders, so it doesn't matter."
16696,Plus they already have a plan to offer boosters with Walvax-Abogen ARCoV (domestic) &amp; Fosun-BioNTech mRNA vaccines when they are available.
16697,"ARCoV is currently in phase 3 trials in Mexico, if it is successful, then it would ease the cold-chain requirements for distribution of mRNA vaccines as it is [thermostable](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7377714/)."
16698,Yup.
16699,Efficiently run.
16700,I’d like to think some people who watched us go in for a vaccine rather than a covid test aspired to be in our line next time!
16701,And he’s probably going to be the next republican presidential candidate
16702,I work in a Florida hospital.
16703,I'm here right now.
16704,It's bad.
16705,Malicious compliance?
16706,Usually natural infections provide better protection in almost all pathogens.
16707,Some studies have shown a better AB response with the vaccine however the vaccine only induces ABs to the spike protein as well as t cells.
16708,During a natural infection your body is exposed to the whole virus and all of its proteins and therefore you likely get a more broad immune response with a natural infection.
16709,Looking at real world data in the UK reinfections have been far less likely to occur than breakthrough infections.
16710,India showed a low rate of reinfections as well.
16711,Furthermore a Cleveland study during the winter wave found no reinfections while there were a small amount of breakthrough infections.
16712,Absolutely and to you as well!
16713,"Or, how *strong* their immune system is... \*sigh\*"
16714,"&gt;Covid was never going to go away

Eh.. it could have if everyone got on board."
16715,Possibly.
16716,It may not have.
16717,But it would have had a shot.

16724,Yep.
16725,"I have friends that were into the vaccine, but felt like crap from the second dose so they now refuse to get a third shot."
16726,"I can't speak for them because I had no reaction whatsoever, but I feel like one bad day shouldn't affect your decision about getting another shot."
16727,"Isn't that essentially what I said, and what this article says?"
16728,Wasn’t there some report that the lambda variant was already showing signs of vaccine resistance?
16729,"my vaccinated manager likely has delta (is getting tested), and was infected with the original strain last year."
16730,"We don't want that, do we?"
16731,"If anything we want more blue people to move to these states, especially the ""purple"" ones."
16732,Let's remember that electoral college!
16733,Israel's data has been more alarming than any other country from the start.
16734,Also I realize I'm bleeding into tinfoil hat territory but I do note that the country that cut a deal with Pfizer is also the country releasing data that seems to most highly suggest that a booster shot is necessary.
16735,"I'm not a denier and I'm double vaxxed, but I also understand it's in Pfizer's interest to increase their sales by 50%."
16736,Of course it could also be explained as a drop in efficacy over time as Israel vaccinated much sooner than almost everyone else.
16737,I'm just wary of big business in general.
16738,"All that said, if the vaccine still reduces severe outcomes in the amounts that it seems to then covid should no longer really retain its status as a virus that dominates our news cycle, at least not for the vaccinated."
16739,"If the extremely likely outcome of catching delta is somewhere on the scale between no symptoms whatsoever and a pretty bad cold then it's hardly worth talking about, no?"
16740,"Weird to see the reference to NY nursing home data issue, because that did NOT result in any undercount of overall covid deaths, they just did not track total deaths of NH residents separately."
16741,Jump on over to conserv@tive and it still doesn't make sense but you will see just how political it really is.
16742,I was in (a suburb of) Tampa in March because my dad who lived there died.
16743,Nobody wore masks at all.
16744,"Not at the bank, police department, funeral home, etc."
16745,"There was a time when I didn’t know if I was sick or if I was just stressed out, but the closest testing facility was 20 miles away so I couldn’t get tested."
16746,Think about this when you hear things like “there wasn’t a spike in cases after the super bowl”.
16747,It’s all on purpose and people are dying.
16748,I feel you😭😭 i'm going into my last year of uni and if its online idek how i'll cope
16749,Hugging an unvaccinated family member was never stated in the article.
16750,Where are you getting that info from?
16751,MO residents be like: tHeM cOvId DeAtH nUmBeRs ArE iNfLaTeD!
16752,!
16753,"I do enjoy armchair scientists thinking they know better than real scientists and doctors who worked, and this is true, 80-90 hour weeks, seven days a week, for the better part of all winter and early spring to get the vaccine ready for FDA approval."
16754,"Please, people who probably didn't even pass high school chemistry, educate the rest of us on how the vaccine was rushed."
16755,I've got a few pissed off scientist friends who busted their ass for this vaccine and are ready to cut some people.
16756,"&gt;But when push comes to shove I've been keeping my mask on because of the kids and people who can't get vaccinated for some actual medical reason

Yeah so you're not in this group."
16757,I'm talking about the ones who were actively mocking anyone wearing a mask.
16758,stop asking when this is gonna end.
16759,it's not anytime soon.
16760,get vaccinated and wear a mask for now.
16761,that's the only answer for now.
16762,Sorry but I want this fucking pandemic to end.
16763,Just get a fucking vaccine.
16764,"Availability for sure, I mean even AUS is not getting any substantial deliveries until after Sept I think?"
16765,Greed?
16766,You mean like the $14.6 billion that Pfizer made in the first quarter 2021?
16767,I don't think he regrets it.
16768,"He tells on himself in some of the later parts of the statement, like when he makes the wild claim that ""half"" of the people who receive the vaccine have detrimental effects, and when he rants about the government trying to control us."
16769,"He also gives inconsistent accounts of whether his GBS symptoms are acute or chronic - he claims that they've gotten worse over time but also claims that he can't risk ""another round"" of it post-vaccination."
16770,"mRNA vaccines don't even cause or flare-up GBS, and in fact viruses and infections are more likely to trigger GBS than any vaccines."
16771,To me that is more an infringement.
16772,You have to give people a choice.
16773,Americans just don't work like that...
16774,What kind of work do you do?
16775,"While I can see recommending wearing masks if you work at a retail store, where thousands of different people are coming in on a weekly basis, if you work at an office where it's always the same few dozen people, not too crowded and you're vaccinated, you can probably ditch the mask."
16776,"Excellent, Thank you!"
16777,Yeah.
16778,AZ is ideally 12 but can be as short as 4 however due to the rare TTS syndrome (the blood clots/low platelet occur primarily between days 4-28) most doctors are recommending 6 weeks.
16779,While Pfizer is three.
16780,I would have preferred Pfizer due to turnaround time (it has its own less publicised issues) but it's in short supply here largely thanks to govt.
16781,ineptitude and of what is available I'm not eligible for.
16782,And considering I live in an area surrounded by the primary hotspots for this outbreak.
16783,Knowing that it's only a matter of time before it leaks into my area and actually working in one of them.
16784,It made sense to go now.
16785,IMHO it's *dense* events rather than *large* events that is the problem (but large events are more likely to be dense).
16786,"Socialize outdoors with ""finnish personal space"" and you're probably good."
16787,"Pack 25-50 people onto a 10'x10' dance floor indoors or out, you're probably not."
16788,"Ya, none of the rich countries will sign on but that may not be a bad thing since they'll end up donating a lot of doses anyways so the poorer countries won't have to actually buy it?"
16789,"You can’t pause a kid’s development with language, social skills, and interactions for too long."
16790,Adults are already developed.
16791,"Kids not seeing friends for more than a year outside of a masked, sanitized environment is terrifying."
16792,Don't refer me back to the article.
16793,I want *you* to explain it to me.
16794,"How would hospitalization be higher if more people are vaccinated, which we *know* reduces hospitalization?"
16795,We have a mandate here so everyone is masking in the grocery store.
16796,High compliance area.

I'll leave researching the drug interactions for Moderna and Jannsen as an exercise for the reader."
16799,"We would really need a worldwide movement to try and eliminate it for good, if even possible."
16800,Most of the variants come from other parts of the world and make their way to us.
16801,"Hmmm, kind of a shame he's vaccinated; he's almost as evil as Mitch McConnell."
16802,They're trying to keep an overbearing federal government from dictating what people put on their faces and into their veins.
16803,I will never side with those who choose to remove basic freedoms from the population.
16804,So what’s the alternative?
16805,Not seeing loved ones with preexisting conditions?
16806,Masks aren’t infallible either and have less efficacy than vaccines.
16807,"Y’all can downvote me all you want, but you’re not going to convince the majority of people that they shouldn’t see any relatives with preexisting conditions in-person because of the chance of getting COVID even if vaccinated."
16808,There is no might.
16809,There will be variants with significant immune escape.

16816,&gt; Where's that quote?
16817,You claim to have read the study.
16818,&gt; Also if ~7k are positive according to you and they tested ~77k then that was a mother fucking 11% positivity rate.
16819,Holly molly!
16820,Are you stupid enough to not realize UK hit double digit positivity with their previous peak ?
16821,They are also not randomly sampled tests.
16822,"And not according to me you moron, according to the study which apparently you can't even read."
16823,Choosing not to have a vaccine isn't the same as a pre existing condition...

16828,"In some states, some counties don't report at all on the weekends, either."
16829,"It's not square one if you can quickly churn out, distribute and administer vaccines targeting the specific spike protein of the new variant."
16830,Not to mention that any new variant should still be recognised by at least some antibodies from previous vaccinations and infections.
16831,I think there are far better things we could do first.
16832,Simply mandate vaccines.
16833,"Well, on the plus side - I'm assuming you're vaccinated and around 22-24 years old?"
16834,"- at least when you get it, it shouldn't hit you as hard?"

16843,Maybe local counties can fight to secede from the states of Texas.
16844,"The virus doesn't mutate *in order to* evade the vaccine, it just mutates blindly."
16845,Given how dominant propagation among the unvaccinated is compared to the vaccinated I suppose that being a bit more vaccine resistant isn't even something that would significantly boost the chance of survival of (and thus select for) those strains.
16846,Another study found that irresponsible people ruin good things for the rest of us.

16860," &gt;I have a lab job

Same here!"
16861,I also came in half time to do bench work.
16862,&gt;some of our administrative staff were WFH full time from March 2020 until June 2021.
16863,"Same, except we went back to full time in mid July."
16864,&gt;Today the company brought back an indoor mask mandate after two months of masks optional for vaccinated employees and our admin staff are all back at home.
16865,Yesterday we got an email from HR  that basically said *The CDC and governor are recommending vaccinated and unvaccinated people wear masks indoors due to a substantial increase in cases in our area.
16866,Vaccinated people still don't have to wear masks at work.
16867,"*

I see people I know are unvaccinated walking around not wearing masks at work."
16868,"One walked into my lab today, and I was going to ask her to put on a mask, and before I could even finish my sentence, and she said she had a doctors note and doesn't have to wear one."
16869,"During all of 2020 the people not taking the virus seriously would have their noses out or ""forget"" all the fucking time and nothing was ever done."
16870,"The HR person is unvaccinated and thinks the vaccine has a computer chip in it (not even joking), the owner is old and is a big fan of 45."
16871,"Freaking, last week an administrative employee sent out an email saying ""I'm wfh today because I have a contractor coming to my house"" - okay cool."
16872,"Then the same day someone in IT comes in and they are visibly sick (stuffy nose, sound like shit) and I asked him ""Why didn't you wfh today?"
16873,"you literally are on a computer all day"" and he said that they wouldn't let him."
16874,No instead they made him come in and get a covid test (we have some at work).
16875,wtf.
16876,As far as my workplace is concerned it's back to BAU and the only way that's changing is if they are forced by the state to behave differently.
16877,"For example, if masks indoors for everyone is mandated instead of strongly suggested."
16878,"The most frustrating part is that last year was fine, everyone got their jobs done, nothing was negatively impacted by everyone wfh, but they refuse to let us."
16879,"One lady I work with has an administrative position, and begged them to let her wfh because her dog has separation anxiety."
16880,"She lives literally 5 mins up the road anyway, and just sits at her desk all day on a computer, and they said not a snowballs chance in hell."
16881,&gt; Don't compare the slight inconvenience of getting vaccinated with banning all cars.
16882,They're not even in the same plane of existence.
16883,I did not make that comparison.
16884,I'm vaccinated.
16885,"I was simply addressing your comment that ""I don't care how few die to this, if it's preventable we all need to prevent it."

16915,1.
16916,Actually it would just disappear if we all started rowing in the same direction.
16917,Because we've done this before to a handful of very serious illnesses.
16918,2.
16919,Not very scary for children now does not mean won't be scary in the future.
16920,The delta variant already appears to be more serious for children the the 2020 strain was.
16921,If total vaccinations stay too low (for all age groups) we could very easily end up in a world where there is a strain that is very bad for children with very long term effects.
16922,Just some food for thought.
16923,I’m going to move on from this post after ending on a positive note with your comment.

16931,Good.

16934,"We live in a society, and if theyre not willing to contribute by getting a free shot, then its time to show them the door."
16935,And the safe and preventative measures for Covid were 2 weeks of total shutdown (abstinence) or masks (condoms).
16936,"People wouldn't do either of those, so now the vaccine is the only option."
16937,Even the Delta variant causing all this trouble is still *majorly* hampered by vaccination
16938,"Not necessarily, especially for MRNA vaccines."
16939,"Let's say there is a new variant that combines mutations of delta, delta +, lambda, and other mutations (ex."
16940,"E484K/Q/R, N501Y, etc) and the efficacy against hospitalization and death drops to unacceptable levels but is still very contagious and starts to take hold and start a future wave in late 2021 or sometime in 2022 or later."
16941,"As far as the MRNA vaccines go, they can be tweaked and sent out in 3-6 months or so in theory from what I read."
16942,"Let’s rephrase:

16951,&gt; Asking for data isnt giving advice.
16952,Oops - I thought you were the person I was originally replying to.
16953,I was referencing something they said.
16954,"&gt; As for your study, it doesn't address the delta variant which is what I'm referring to."
16955,This Israel study stopped collecting data back in March.
16956,The delta variant is the issue.
16957,"Regardless, it's always been known that it's *possible* to transmit any variant of COVID while vaccinated - you and I both understand that the vaccine doesn't magically delete the virus once it enters your personal space."
16958,"The goal is reducing the *likelihood* (that you'll be symptomatic, that you'll be hospitalized, and that you'll spread it to others)."
16959,"On a society level, it's all about odds."
16960,We also agree that the the Delta variant is much more contagious than any other variant.
16961,"Which *increases* the likelihood than any given person, vaxxed or not, will spread it to others through the course of their infection."
16962,"So the fact that it's easier to transmit breakthrough Delta isn't some kind of ""gotcha"" against vaccines, especially given the alternative."
16963,"If anything, the Delta variant re-emphasizes the importance of vaccines."
16964,"It arose in India, a country with access to a pitiful number of vaccines relative to its huge, dense population."
16965,And breakthrough transmission only *really* matters because more and more unvaxxed people are getting sick and taking up hospital beds.

17007,"Yes, that's true and more or less describes the normal situation with influenza, but with influenza everyone except the very young has been exposed to and has partial immunity to multiple variants."
17008,"People still get the flu because the new variants are sufficiently different, but they tend to get relatively mild cases because they have partial immunity from having been exposed to variants that are similar enough that their immune system isn't starting from zero."
17009,Every several decades a variant that's different enough that many fewer people have much immunity to it and we get a flu pandemic.

17011,"Once most people have been infected a few times, hopefully that will be enough that usually their immune system will be able to fight off a future infection with nothing more than cold symptoms."
17012,Vaccinations make getting that immune system knowledge a lot less dangerous.
17013,The nightmare scenario is that each COVID infection is just as dangerous as the last and every indoor in-person interaction carries a real risk of hospitalization and post-viral symptoms forever.

17269,"If COVID became far more severe, the amount of mild/asymptomatic spreaders would decrease."
17270,"In the short term the death rate would spike, yet the virus would struggle to transmit, since more people who have it would be bed bound."

17296,"Until there is a vaccine for under 12s, mine are staying home."
17297,At least we can all take comfort in the fact celebrities can get wherever they need to go.

17300,"1) it’s cute you made up your own definition, but the actual one is “tending to intrude on a person's thoughts or privacy” which just doesn’t apply here."
17301,There are also other definitions of invasive (such as invasive species) but they apply here even less.
17302,2) that’s data for the original strain.
17303,Data for the delta variant is less certain as of right now.
17304,There are some indications it could be more infectious and harmful to children than previous strains.
17305,"Also because it is more infectious, it could be that children are at greater risk of spreading this to people who are older or have compromised immune systems (including some of their classmates)."
17306,It’s just a really low risk thing to wear a mask right for now and then likely be able to not have to wear it in a few months once vaccines are available for kids and can be required for attendance.
17307,Reject the practices that lead to zoonotic disease outbreaks.
17308,No more animal products.
17309,don't you make may noodle prices go up
17310,Yes and no lol.
17311,What you fail to realize is that we need balance.
17312,We’re currently going from extreme to extreme and nothing productive happens.
17313,"I’m more than willing to meet in the middle and discuss protocols, but this whole extremeism is completely asinine and destructive for our society."
17314,I’m sorry but children are our future and what’s happening to them now is going to be catastrophic to their development for decades to come.
17315,I’m not speaking to you directly but my hope is that someone reads this and opens their mind to try to understand what exactly is going on.

17326,My coworker and her spouse said they had no side effects from the vaccine (Pfizer and JJ).
17327,They had covid about 2 months prior to getting vaccinated.
17328,and giving it to their yolo parents
17329,[removed]
17330,"You don't need to do anything, I am perfectly fine with you not getting vaccine if you don't want to."
17331,"No one is forcing you, is it?"
17332,"It's your life, I am fascinated you think anyone else cares."
17333,The endgame is when we get to a point when a few different possibilities happen.
17334,1) We get 80% or more of the population vaccinated.
17335,"Yeah, it's not everyone, but it's enough to decrease spread and reduce deaths."
17336,2) A variant emerges that is less severe and becomes the dominant variant.
17337,Or a variant that is less infectious and fizzles out (unlikely) Many diseases that mutate become more infectious and less deadly as they mutate.
17338,A virus only wants to infect as many hosts as possible.
17339,It really doesn't care about lethality.
17340,(In simple terms obv.)
17341,3) We have yearly booster shots rolled into our flu shots that keep up with emerging variants.
17342,This seems like the most likely path.
17343,"Regardless, a lot more research is still needed on how this virus mutates and its long term effects on those infected."
17344,We're honestly lucky to already have a vaccine that is effective at reducing severity of the disease.
17345,"We're all tired of it, but we have a good chunk of the population actively ignoring science and choosing to be selfish pricks."
17346,That doesn't help us move beyond this.
17347,"Just from personal observation, it really depends on what part of Central Florida."
17348,I went to Publix yesterday and I only saw one person not wearing a mask.
17349,"My son and I, who are both in STEM, were just talking about how we had to take some liberal arts class in order to be “well-rounded,” but I don’t see anything about liberal arts students being required to take any science classes to be considered “well rounded.”

17355,Fill me in!
17356,It’s terrible.
17357,I like the comment below.
17358,They’re just people.
17359,Like those front line workers at fucking McDonalds or whatever.
17360,Burnt out.
17361,Aren’t a lot of hospitals at Code Black (zero new admissions allowed)?
17362,I think thats fair.
17363,"But I have a feeling most of the ""changes"" were not this case."
17364,This is what I’ve realized in the last two years of COVID.
17365,They’re not ignorant.
17366,They hate and use their religion to excuse it
17367,Probably just in time for the next zoonotic disease to pop up lol
17368,"I know you didn’t ask, but from one stranger to another I would recommend you look into EMDR."
17369,"I have experienced extraordinary, tangible benefits since starting a couple months ago (started experiencing physical relief from a crazy symptom after the first fucking session and it has only compounded!)."
17370,"And beyond that, the releases that I am experiencing during the sessions feel like orgasms for my soul."
17371,Truly.
17372,PS I agree that this is a Big Fucking Mess.
17373,I am immunocompromised AND a science/medicine nerd AND a giant empath so it’s a mindfuck on top of a mindfuck on top of a mindfuck on top of a mindfuck and on and on.
17374,"No, efficacy should scale."
17375,"In other words, if unvaccinated cases go up by 1,000, at 90% efficacy then vaccinated cases would go up by 100."
17376,That's what efficacy means.
17377,"According to the [AAP](https://downloads.aap.org/AAP/PDF/AAP%20and%20CHA%20-%20Children%20and%20COVID-19%20State%20Data%20Report%207.29%20FINAL.pdf), there were 181 child hospitalizations last week across the 24 states that track and publish that data plus NYC."
17378,There were 122 in the previous week.
17379,For comparison there were about 500 a week in the surge last winter.
17380,I had mono as a teenager and I don’t think I ever really recovered.
17381,"Even if you've already been infected, you need to be vaccinated."
17382,The antibodies aren't guaranteed to have a long-lasting effect in the body at fighting future infection.
17383,Even the vaccine will require boosters to remain effective.
17384,"A sample size that large isn't necessary to find statistical significance, but the latter two pieces are definitely important and speaks a lot to the quality of ""pandemic science"" that you even have to ask for it."

17392,It will eventually end.
17393,"It could be a highly contagious version that is less lethal, one that is just as contagious but more lethal, or one that is more contagious and more lethal."
17394,"It’ll run it’s way through the population, either kill itself off or kill a large chunk of the population where it eliminates its ability to spread easily."
17395,I’m in a parents FB group and they’re freaking out over the thought of kids and staff needing to wear masks this school year.
17396,Yeah...
17397,I haven't talked to them since my grandfather passed.

17404,Exactlyyyyyy this.
17405,"If we worried about every single persons potential risk in every aspect of life, we would never get anything done."
17406,Eventually it becomes those most at risk need to take their precautions upon themselves.
17407,"I realize how unempathetic this sounds but I mean, we didn’t stop producing peanut products because people could be allergic to them."
17408,The people allergic are expected to stay the fuck away from situations that involve peanuts.
17409,People forget that for most of human history disease was a primary factor in our survival....or lack there of.
17410,We've had a nice little lull in action for the last hundred years or so.
17411,But it's likely we're going back to the days when everyone had a legitimate chance of dying from contagious disease.
17412,🤣 hahahahaha
17413,"It really sucks, by honestly..if you want change, vote like it."
17414,Yes.
17415,And it’s a good option &amp; worth the risk.. FOR PEOPLE THAT HAVENT BEEN INFECTED.
17416,ALREADY
17417,Maybe take some steps to prevent other zoonotic diseases from breaking out?
17418,I haven’t really seen any discussion about that.
17419,People really seem to think that COVID-19 is going to be the last pandemic we encounter or something.
17420,"Compassion for the spiteful, and tolerance for the intolerant."
17421,"Naw, I'm gone, they're just being straight up assholes."
17422,You forgot the /s at the end of your sentence.
17423,When COVID becomes more manageable and deaths and hospitalizations stay low (which will happen sooner or later) there will be no reason to wear masks.
17424,If people want to wear masks then fine but the mandates will go away.
17425,Definitely *feels* right.
17426,Seems illegal
17427,Go somewhere that isn’t a campground.
17428,Find a random road and go to a lake or river and camp
17429,Nope.
17430,Not true at all.
17431,"We've already seen severe disease, transmission and infection dissipate significantly."
17432,Even the CDC director acknowledges its very possible a variant can soon evade severe disease and death.
17433,"Also, the stupid virologists who at the beginning proclaimed that the virus was not gonna be an issue are the same ones pushing the idea that the virus cant mutate - ironically, the same people also who have an anxious-personality and don't want things going the opposite way they intend."
17434,I’m a vaccinated nut that feels my risk is now small enough that I don’t care.
17435,🤷🏼‍♂️

17447,Lotr?
17448,No shit …

17451,The UK is still not doing better than other European countries.
17452,"You guys came from a terrible situation, but the UK is nowhere near a good situation."
17453,The main issue is that the places implementing restrictions are typically the areas which are the most vaccinated…while the unvaccinated get to go to concerts and be masks free in the areas they live.
17454,What a disaster and a mess.
17455,Stop trying to circumvent AutoMod.
17456,C'mon y'all.
17457,Does it usually take this amount of time to approve a vaccine or is it being rushed?
17458,"Not anti vax, just wondering"
17459,LMAO he called the knuckleheads
17460,You Governor is looking to kill children.
17461,Delta variant is continues to effect ever younger children.
17462,"If you are 70 years old and get Covid complications, meh, only about 10 years to live…imagine as a 10 years old."
17463,My daughter got Moderna and contracted the Delta variant.
17464,My other daughters got Pfizer and tested negative.
17465,All were exposed equally.
17466,[removed]
17467,"If I’m reading this correctly, less than 20% are under 18, and less than 20% of those are under 12."
17468,So the under 12’s make up 4% of COVID patients?
17469,Am I reading this right?
17470,I can relate because I was once in a similar position.
17471,"I hated my smoking addiction because it smelled and tasted terrible, but at the same time, I loved the feeling of smoking and being outside for just 5 minutes."
17472,"Cigarettes also have a satisfying ""hourglass"" feeling to them, whereas vapes are infinite given enough juice and battery life and really aren't as satisfying."
17473,I couldn't quit smoking until I started Wellbutrin.
17474,It's definitely not mutating faster than the flu.
17475,"But it is mutating quickly, and that's because a tremendous number of people are being infected every day, and every infection rolls the dice for a new variant."
17476,"At this point it's just do the opposite of what democrats want, doesn't matter at all what it is, they're gonna literally die on that hill."
17477,Even with an edited vaccine - its the testing phase I believe that’ll take time - 6 months I believe at minimum
17478,I simply don’t care anymore
17479,"Yeah a lot of people still don’t know about the issues with that study, like what you mentioned."
17480,It’s obvious the CDC was under immense pressure and made a quick decision.
17481,Now we have seemingly no exit strategy with the masks and it is frustrating.
17482,Before it was “wait until a vaccine”.
17483,Now I’m not sure what it is.
17484,I bought the hot sauce because I thought the guy on the bottle resembled him.
17485,Turns out it’s his hot sauce and it’s a drawing of him on it.
17486,They make you work really hard to fail somebody.
17487,"Have to write a letter to a dean, etc."
17488,I did fail one kid who never turned anything in after the first week.
17489,And I gave out a lot of D's.
17490,I was not at Harvard but at a different Ivy which prides itself on grade DEflation so my grade distribution was not policed much beyond not failing people.
17491,I taught CS classes so I didn't get a lot of the slackers in my classes in the first place.
17492,Pfizer and Merck are already in phase 3 trials.
17493,About 4 months too late
17494,That's awesome more employers should do this!
17495,I also think they should be free to buy in stores though or at minimum heavily subsidized.

17497,"Yep, I'm British and living in the UK."
17498,"I'm not exempt from the ban, I haven't seen my family since December 2019."
17499,"I'm fully vaccinated, homesick and depressed."
17500,It is if you understand that the vaccines are specifically priming our immune systems to recognize the spike proteins.
17501,"If the spike proteins mutate away, it’s unlikely Covid poses much of a risk."
17502,"Back when I thought my risk of complications was low, I wanted vaccinated to protect others mostly."
17503,I know better now.
17504,There are only super crowded campgrounds here.
17505,No dispersal camping within our  range.

17514,You'd think they were being asked to give half their income to charity or something
17515,We definitely all will at some point in our lives.

17525,My youngest starts Kindergarten this year and I bet she's distance learning by November
17526,Was the study conducted during lockdown?
17527,Was it conducted when mask mandate was in place?
17528,Was it conducted when people socially distanced?
17529,There are many factors and I think you are simplifying the situation too much.
17530,"Regardless, the point of the conversation is lost to me so I will just stop right here."
17531,The UK is a fine counterpoint to your assumption.
17532,"Extremely high vaccination rate (88% of adults have 1 jab or more), extremely high testing (some of the highest in the world, and half of the world's sequencing), very high covid numbers."
17533,All because of Delta making things just too damn infectious to keep the numbers low.

17540,You can crudely extrapolate figures for efficacy though.
17541,I've done this in another thread.
17542,I hope the next variant involves oozing pustules if that’s what it takes for these ignorant unimaginative assholes to get on board with the social contract
17543,People...
17544,"There is no dispersed camping here in my area, only campgrounds that fill up fast."
17545,They get crowded and are not as socially distant as one might think.
17546,The one attempt made so far made us all agree we are not going to enjoy ourselves trying tell crazy Antivaxxers and trolls to stay away because we still have unprotected people with us.
17547,That is 100% not what we are after...
17548,So for now we just ride bikes and play catch.
17549,Until my kid gets the the same  protection that we have already gotten the benefits from and can find better situations within our travel range.

17709,So the alternative is if we don't want our kids to get sick we have to shelter ourselves and them.

17738,"Many people have taken various other vaccines, but feel hesitant to take this one."
17739,2) Many people seem to confuse “trust science” with “trust big pharmaceutical companies”.

17815,I doubt they will grant EUA for the mRNA vaccines for under 12 - they likely wouldn't have done so for teens at all if they would have known the signal most countries now have seen in young males and myocarditis.
17816,1/5000 (or even 1/14000 according to VAERS/CDC) is quite common as side effects go and they'd probably have better success with AZ or J&amp;J for that age group.
17817,It took the CDC two months of pushback to finally admit to the link - despite Israel and France giving a heads up early on - and now we're in a situation where most parents don't want to vaccinate their kids.
17818,Part of this is cultural.
17819,Homeschool is pretty normalized in the U.S.
17820,"Since covid, richer families are pooling resources to hire a teacher to teach their child (i.e., a ""covid pod"")."

If more people were vaccinated, the overwhelming majority of those vaccinations would be among adults."

17896,"The FDA can (and would) show up unannounced and conduct a full audit of everything going on, and if they didn't like what they saw they had the authority to shut the lab down."

17914,With the info we now have on myocarditis in young men I would be incredibly surprised if they approved it despite the increased risk.
17915,Why is Georgia so bad?
17916,Not even Atlanta is showing decent vaxx numbers.
17917,This map seems very questionable tome.
17918,"This is literally exactly why I had the disclaimer at the end of that paragraph, to try to head off these kinds of misinterpretations."
17919,The data does NOT say that the vaccine wanes after 20 weeks.
17920,"They have 20 weeks of data, and from that, they saw no evidence of waning."
17921,"At the time that they reported their results, they did NOT say it would wane after that because that data did not exist."
17922,"Even if it does wane, it’s not going to be like it drops off a cliff at 21 weeks; there will very likely still be a high degree of protection for a long time given the lack of diminishment for at least 20 weeks."
17923,We just don’t know exactly when that will happen.

17970,Thanks for the info
17971,I think at this point it's natural selection.
17972,Unfortunately for our kids who can't be vaccinated yet.
17973,I hope for  them soon.
17974,I feel bad for breakthrough infections.
17975,I stopped masking for a short while but not social distancing.
17976,I am masking and social distancing now.
17977,&gt; Everyone can wear masks and distance.
17978,No Thanksgiving dinners with grandma anymore since you’re not going to be wearing masks or distancing.
17979,"&gt; We aren’t hanging around maskless, unvaccinated people who may be infected."

17982,SCENARIO:  A person with asthma is coughing a lot and faints.
17983,They end up in the ER and subsequently tests positive for Covid.
17984,Covid ends up becoming severe due to the asthma and they end up on a ventilator and pass away.
17985,"The family tell the guy, look we don’t like Covid on the death certificate cuz our loved one always suffered from asthma."

17987,WHAT A FUCKER.

17989,The thresholds are based on the R0.
17990,Based on the R0 you can pretty accurately determine what percentage of the population you need vaccinated to halt spread.
17991,I think the media does want the worst to happen.
17992,This pandemic has given them a new life.
17993,How often did many of us even look at our local or national media sites before COVID?
17994,I feel like the media has an interest in keeping this pandemic going for as long as possible and by putting out constant fear mongering headlines they are getting clicks to their websites that they never would with a good news story.

18010,In the Space Coast of FL.
18011,Many people started going 'back to normal' in May of last year when restrictions lifted and have  never rethought that after the summer and winter peaks.
18012,More unmasked than masked has been normal in stores.
18013,Very few masks anywhere after CDC said they weren't needed inside for vaccinated people.
18014,Maybe 40% of kids I see out are masked.
18015,I encounter a denier in some form every day.
18016,"I'm terrified about school reopening in a week, the county won't even consider a special school board meeting to address delta."
18017,It's a bit of both.
18018,"I don't think anyone can argue in good faith that China hasn't fudged their coronavirus figures, however, it is also probable that their extreme measures are very effective at reducing the spread of the virus."
18019,I mean c'mon man they have supposedly had less total cases than freaking Finland!
18020,It looks like he thinks high school and college students should be vaccinated.
18021,"""He said he's concerned about children under age 12 who aren't old enough to get vaccinated."""
18022,"Still dumb though, he should let all schools decide."
18023,I feel like people are undermining a central argument for vaccination when they make it seem like vaccination has zero impact on the spread of COVID.
18024,The recent news about transmission *after* infection of those vaccinated has obscured the fact that vaccines still reduce the number of infections.
18025,"If people believe that vaccination only has the effect of improving your individual outcome, then younger and healthier people who have been more resistant have less of a reason to get vaccinated."
18026,"It no longer is an imperative to get vaccination to help your family or your community, it's just a question of your own individual risk, which isn't in fact what's happening."
18027,The reduction in infection for mRNA vaccines is still well above the 50% threshold that was initially set for measuring effectiveness.
18028,And thats the last we hear of it
18029,Pull them out and home school until they can get a vaccine.
18030,"If they did remote last year, then you can make home school work."
18031,At least until the vaccine is available.

18046,Good luck
18047,"That means that 20% of people that tested positive did develop serious pneumonia, which is actually higher than I expected considering the amount of people who have mild cases of Covid to begin with."
18048,That is 1/5.
18049,"If you are trying to say Covid doesn't cause pneumonia, your stat is proving otherwise."
18050,"Is that children as in under 12, or are those including teens?"
18051,Where are people pulling these obviously made up pediatric influenza numbers?
18052,&gt;How many children died from the flu during the 2015-2016 season?
18053,"As of September 15, 2016, a total of 85 laboratory-confirmed influenza-associated pediatric deaths occurring during the 2015-2016 flu season were reported to CDC from Puerto Rico, the District of Columbia, and 33 states."
18054,Sometimes there is a lag time for reporting of pediatric deaths.
18055,For the most recent data and more information visit FluView: Influenza-Associated Pediatric Mortality.
18056,"Since influenza-associated pediatric mortality became a nationally-notifiable condition during the 2004-2005 season, the total number of influenza-associated pediatric deaths has ranged from 37 to 171."

18078,it took me 20 minutes from the time i called to set the appointment until i was done and driving home.
18079,but that was months ago.
18080,now i'd just get a shot at walmart when you were shopping if you're trying to hide it.
18081,no symptoms for me but there were symptoms for a lot of people that mimic a cold/flu for a couple days
18082,Thanks for that article.
18083,Our entire society will bear this burden.
18084,It is unthinkable.
18085,Yes but pre-existing conditions can be caused by preventable activities such as smoking or eating a double cheeseburger or having a beer All things that are personal choices like getting the Vaccine.
18086,At this point we’re not talking about an issue of public health were talking about insurance companies having any excuse to Charge people more
18087,"1) find a single definition from any dictionary that matches what you say

2) I don’t have any proof."
18088,Didn’t claim to.
18089,Said there’s anecdotes and we should be cautious until we have more evidence or until everyone can be vaccinated.
18090,3) we all have worked with kids and have kids.
18091,"You’re not special

4) there’s no reason for your kids to be scared if they mask up and avoid unnecessary risks."
18092,That’s literally the whole point of the guidelines.

5) hysteria?"
18094,Calm tf down dude.
18095,"The only emotional trauma here is some middle aged dude getting bent out of shape about putting a 25 cent cloth over his face for a few more months…

5) oh - we’re doing mom jokes now?"
18096,Ironic this is coming from the guy that accused me of being childish earlier on.
18097,I hate anybody who had a vaccine growing up!
18098,"Yeah, that's not what we are comparing."
18099,Breakthrough infections calculated in this manner is only to compare vaccines to each other.
18100,It has nothing to do with unvaccinated individuals.
18101,Right!?
18102,The people complaining about masks and lockdowns won't do the one thing to remove masks and lockdowns.
18103,"I don't smoke, but these days I constantly feel like I need a cigarette."
18104,they have to vax the cows because they are in nasty conditions in those corporate farms
18105,"It's been 1.5 years, not surprised."

18119,I would do that in a heartbeat but my pharmacist says it's not allowed.
18120,The people doing that are probably not saying they've been vaxxed already
18121,Most urgent care facilities offer them.
18122,"When I drew the short end of the stick and caught Covid in November (so no vaccination yet), I lost my sense of smell entirely, which in turn meant I couldn't taste anything."
18123,"Now, it wasn't like total lack of sense in my mouth."
18124,"I could still distinguish salty or sweet or spicy and what not, but it was like."
18125,"Generically sweet, or generically salty."
18126,If that makes sense?
18127,Can't speak to other experiences though.
18128,It's possible that I had a mild experience with the smell.
18129,"I had a mild case overall, thankfully."
18130,Amazing so many folks willing to die of Covid for Trump just see Biden fail….
18131,Please elaborate.
18132,I manage a Walgreens pharmacy and the tests should be drive thru only..

18143,"Just dye your hair blue, and no one will question it ever again"
18144,"Question for everyone here, did you get your pneumonia vaccine in any of the years before Covid hit?"
18145,You do know that pneumonia is way deadlier for children than Covid.
18146,"So if you didn't get your pneumonia vaccine, you were way more likely to contribute to a death of a child than if you haven't gotten the Covid vaccine."
18147,Just so we can be clear and stop ignoring facts.
18148,Covid is not the only thing that kills people.
18149,I'm not sure why people go there at all.
18150,"Canada is just as far, and a lot safer, and similar enough in most ways."
18151,Maybe if you really like canyons I could see it.
18152,"There are a couple of studies demonstrating that antibody levels don't rise as high when given the other way around (mRNA 1st, AZ 2nd)."

18154,There's just no data.
18155,They’re bringing antibodies.
18156,Their bringing t-cells.
18157,They’re vaccinated.

18159,Truth.
18160,"When you don't see someone in the news where they are all the time, they caught covid."
18161,Looking at some football players.
18162,Being overweight doesn’t cause other people to die.
18163,Big difference.
18164,The FDA/CDC guidance for those who have been fully vaccinated by a vaccine approved in another country but not the US which are coming to the US for long term is to get revaccinated with a US approved vaccine.
18165,I don’t see why mixing and matching a foreign and US vaccine would be that different than mixing and matching two US vaccines from a safety perspective.

18192,"“If the only people who were being tested were those that showed symptoms of Covid, you would be close to having a point.”

This is the large majority of who is being tested though and that’s what you’re missing."
18193,It’s not representative of a broader scope of the population.
18194,Front line hospital workers and symptomatic people are not a true random sample.
18195,That’s who is tested.
18196,They’re not testing people out at grocery stores.
18197,It’s only job mandated testing and those sick enough to get curious to go find out.
18198,They aren’t testing random people at a random office or random people off a random plane.
18199,They are testing specific segments that don’t represent the whole population.
18200,It’s not a good randomized sample like you want.
18201,"It doesn’t track asymptomatic cases, or even mildly symptomatic ones."
18202,It’s a meaningless stat.
18203,The only fact this may tell you is a percentage of people directly exposed or who are sick that are turning up positive.
18204,"The sample always varies too, one days it’s a few hundred symptomatic, the next day it’s a few hundred front line hospital workers, the next day nursing home residents."
18205,"To correctly get a positivity rate that actually meant something you’d have to randomly sample from the general public perform say 10,000 tests a day over a course of so many days and you’d get a better indication."
18206,"What they’re doing now though is akin to testing 10 sick people, having 8 come back positive and claiming 80% positivity (exaggerated but its the point I’m trying to make here), then the next day testing 10 at a country market and having 1 come back and saying it’s 10%."

18360,Did I say that nobody would be admitted to hospitals?
18361,No.
18362,Did I say that ignoring covid is what we should do?
18363,Also no.
18364,"All I pointed out was that public compliance is a necessity, but it only lasts so long and if enough of the population is tired enough, socially the pandemic will end at some point before it ends medically."

18385,"That's enough for me to assume it's safe and is (at least somewhat) effective

I'm happy to accept any risk at this point."
18386,Because I think the reward of not getting infected &amp; (more importantly) not spreading to others/ at-risk family is far greater
18387,"Taking a 3rd dose base on your own "" research"" is anti-vax level cringe."

18529,wonder what the medical issue is.
18530,seems like it probably has a classification if it's real and not perceived.
18531,"Denis Leary needs to update his ""A******"" song."
18532,They ask when someone gets tested.
18533,You don't need data from every single person to get an accurate statistic.
18534,You might ask why someone would get tested if they're vaccinated.
18535,"People have to get tested for many reasons: requirement to return to the office, take a flight, attend something in a group setting, if they plan to be around at-risk family, etc."
18536,They don’t wanna follow the rules but are too cowardly to actually not wear one at all.
18537,"That's what they said when the first surge occurred, and then the Delta came along."
18538,Pretty sure it was the strict lock downs in India that did the trick.
18539,"I'm not saying the spread wasn't pretty far and wide,  but I don't think it swept through everyone."
18540,Not the flu but before the pandemic I’d get bronchitis every spring anywhere from a few weeks to the longest being 4 months and tbh the wheeze never went away even 3 years later after the 4 month infection

18544, That's how I see it.
18545,"If you want to go back to work, you should be able to."
18546,"If you want to work from home, and your productivity isn't affected, you should be able to."
18547,What other conditions do you think should be met before a person is able to participate in society?
18548,For example can a singles bar require negative STD tests?
18549,"Lol , right"
18550,They can and already are working on it agaik
18551,"I was only wfh half the week, but it was better than nothing."
18552,"You can say that as sarcastically as you want but if the people decide that the vaccines make life safe enough for them and the pandemic is over, then it’s over."
18553,"You can only get the public to comply to restrictions for so long and once a significant enough amount of people decide that it’s over, it is over, socially."
18554,That makes sense.
18555,"&gt; The proportion of people suffering from long Covid 12 weeks after initial infection remains uncertain, with estimates varying between studies from 2.3 per cent to 37 per cent, the paper said."
18556,37 percent - even halved - is pretty fucking high.

18558,That was a smart choice.
18559,"I’m an ICU RN here in Los Angeles, and we have had more doctors and nurses get sick with COVID than before we had vaccines."
18560,Some of these doctors and nurses have been quite sick.
18561,"They were not hospitalized, but I know of one doctor and my close friend who is a nurse (healthy 30 year old female, Caucasian) who have had some very bad neurological symptoms."
18562,"I agree, it’s insane."

18572,Thank you for illustrating how antivaxx notions gain a veneer of credibility.
18573,"The current Case Fatality Rate is around 0.1%, while overall it is over 2%."
18574,"Of course we're always missing infections, so the Infection Fatality Rate is even lower."
18575,"For reference, the flu Infection Fatality Rate (despite readily available vaccines) has been estimated to between 0.09% - 0.17% over the last 10 years."
18576,We're at the point where worrying about how deadly it is once vaccinated is silly.
18577,It will remain to be seen if masks alone will be enough to reproduce the lack of getting sick in 2020.
18578,"Nowadays a lot fewer people are working from home, travel is back up, public businesses are open at full capacity, etc."
18579,and I don't expect that to change even if more places bring back mask mandates.
18580,"My sister is an ICU nurse as Oschner’s (sp),  she said canceled elective surgery and had to open another wing to accommodate

18583,"But having one year of restrictions was too much effort for the human race, so now we have a prolonged battle."
18584,all that shit is already happening.
18585,raise insurance for unvaccinated.
18586,prioritize covid care to the vaccinated over an unvaccinated(if the only reason they didn't get it is they just didn't want to.)
18587,have to be fair there are valid reasons not to have the vaccine.
18588,"There are other factors also at play, such as immune response/overactivation, and other risk factors, but the increased viral load is certainly one of the factors making Delta more transmissible, and negatively impacting younger patients than previous variants."

18605,I agree with everything you said except for the “people stay home” part.
18606,Sad reality is MANY people in the United States (myself included) simply don’t get paid if they don’t work.
18607,Especially the self-employed where it’s not as simple as “I didn’t get paid that day…it could actually be like “if xyz doesn’t get done I lose the account/client/patient/etc.
18608,"and this is potentially financially devastating.”

If I’m really sick, I don’t go to work."
18609,"But, let’s be real here."
18610,If you get a mild flu…are you taking a week off?
18611,Just the sickest day?
18612,Two days?
18613,For many people it’s a financial/family future decision.

18620,We will have a mega delta by winter
18621,I like fauci and I think it’s pretty clear that throughout this ordeal he has pretty much always tried to be honest and lead the country down the safest path with the least death and suffering.
18622,"With that being said, what he said here seems kind of irresponsible."
18623,Of course he’s scared of an escape variant.
18624,We all are.
18625,That’d be a nightmare scenario.
18626,"But there’s really not a lot we we a country can do about that, and that includes getting vaccinated."
18627,Getting our vaccination rate up is not going to save us from an escape variant.
18628,Just look at what’s happening right now.
18629,Did Delta arise from our 90 million morons who refuse to be part of the solution and perpetuated this pandemic in this country throughout the past several  months with our 10k cases a day?
18630,"No, it came from the 6 bajillion daily cases that were getting pumped out on the opposite side of the planet."
18631,"The escape variant, if it ever happens, will likely be the same story."
18632,"You're absolutely right, but I feel like that's still not casting a wide enough net."

18654,I’m ve worried that my school is going to bring masks back despite requiring vaccinations.
18655,"And I know some disagree, but masks absolutely do have a social cost."
18656,They make it much harder to participate enthusiastically in class or events.
18657,But also the school could absolutely stop me lol

18664,All these measures have been about making a dent in the numbers and avoiding catastrophe.
18665,That's the problem.
18666,it's another half assed measure thats gonna do very little to help with reducing the spread and is gonna do a lot for further divide everyone on what new normal will/should look like.
18667,"I'm personally on the side of ""lets just go back to normal and fuck the people who didnt get the shot"" but if you're in the camp of ""we need to eradicate covid"" then lets cut the crap and actually fucking do it."
18668,All we're doing with this shit is pissing people off
18669,Show me some quantifiable data showing where mask use has actually had more than a minimal effect in reducing Covid spread?
18670,&gt; I wonder what constitutes a valid non-medical exemption to the vaccination....
18671,"Someone who recovered from covid, has a positive antibody test, and believes they are adequately protected and who fervently believes it would be immoral for them to be vaccinated before everyone in the third world has been offered vaccination."
18672,lexapro saved me.
18673,You don't really have to hope.
18674,It's basically a guarantee.

18679,Only a tiny fraction of people in Southeast Asia have been exposed to novel bat coronaviruses.
18680,It's on the order of a few percent in rural villages in direct proximity to bat populations.
18681,"In cities, it's essentially zero."
18682,"These exposures are interesting from the point of view of understanding spillover, but they're not anywhere near what you'd need to cause widespread immunity."

18684,"There's a broad region in East Asia that has a shared literary, governmental, philosophical, religious tradition."
18685,"Compliance with public health measures is much higher in East Asia, as is the willingness to make personal sacrifices for the community."
18686,This plays out in many ways.
18687,"One example: Germany tried developing a contact-tracing app, and only something like a third of people downloaded it, much less used it."
18688,"In China, everyone has a contact-tracing app."
18689,"In South Korea, the government gets everyone's cell data - and people largely accept that."
18690,"In Germany, they couldn't even manage to automatically report positive tests in the app."
18691,That would be too much of an intrusion into the citizens' privacy.
18692,"So every user had to manually enter in their own positive tests, and half of them didn't even bother to do so."
18693,"From the Chinese perspective, the unwillingness of Europeans and Americans to just end the outbreaks in their countries once and for all - something which is entirely doable - is completely baffling."

With its population vaccinated against the coronavirus at a fast pace and only a handful of new cases being reported, Israel all but declared victory over the virus earlier this year."
18713,"But now, as the country’s authorities struggle to contain the spread of the highly contagious Delta variant, they are set to reintroduce restrictions, in what they say is a last attempt to forestall another lockdown."
18714,"The new measures, announced by the government late Tuesday, include expanding vaccine and mask-wearing requirements for some gatherings, a shift back to a work-from-home policy, and more sweeping travel restrictions."
18715,"Some of the new restrictions are expected to take effect Sunday, and others later in August."
18716,"The reversal, coming only a few months after Israel reopened its economy and glimpsed a vaccinated, post-pandemic future, is widely regarded as a test for Israel’s new prime minister, Naftali Bennett."
18717,"When he was a member of the opposition last year, Mr. Bennett wrote a booklet on how to beat the pandemic that criticized the government of his predecessor, Benjamin Netanyahu, for its handling of the crisis."
18718,He also blamed Mr. Netanyahu for what he said was a failing strategy that led to a holiday lockdown last year.
18719,"Now that he is in charge of the government, Mr. Bennett faces the prospect of having to impose another lockdown over the Jewish holidays in September."
18720,"“Our goal is to keep Israel open, but not to get to the stage where the hospitals will one day have to say: ‘There’s no room, you can’t come in,’” Mr. Bennett said on Wednesday at the inauguration of a vaccination center in Jerusalem."
18721,"“We know when to hit the brakes.”

A country of nine million people where most citizens over 16 are fully inoculated with the two-dose Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine, Israel was among the first countries to offer a third dose to people with compromised immune systems, which it began to do last month."
18722,Israel has since begun to administer third doses to people aged 60 and over.
18723,"Still, about a million Israelis who are eligible to be vaccinated have so far refused to do so, despite the wide availability of the vaccine."
18724,"“That was, and is, the problem, the main thing that is bringing us closer to harsh restrictions,” Eran Segal, an expert at the Weizmann Institute of Science, wrote on Twitter."
18725,"Studies have indicated that immunity from Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna vaccines is long-lasting, and researchers are still working to understand recent Israeli data that suggested the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine declined in efficacy a few months after inoculation."
18726,"The Israeli authorities have been alarmed by the swift surge in new cases reported daily in the country, which could be counted on one hand in mid-June but have surpassed 3,000 in recent days, according to Israeli Ministry of Health data."
18727,Many Israelis say the easing of airport restrictions was to blame for allowing the Delta variant to become dominant in the country.
18728,"The government said that people arriving from “most countries of the world” would soon be required to quarantine, including people who have been vaccinated or have recovered from a coronavirus infection."
18729,Post viral complications seem to be about as common as long Covid - which is just a post viral complication by another name.
18730,I’ve heard an immunologist suggest that the reason we see more long Covid at the moment is because the virus circulated so widely through the population all at once.

18756,"So it doesn't matter if your area is all 10 acre+ homesteads, so long as most people who live there are commuting into an urban area for work."
18757,"Put another way: the ""metropolitan"" designation is a functional/economic definition rather than a physical/landscape-based one."
18758,"&amp;#x200B;

Edit: the [definition on Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metropolitan_statistical_area) has a bit more nuance to it, mainly re: defining core counties, which do have to be urbanized."
18759,This makes the vaccination success rate stats very confusing.
18760,If vaccinated people tend to continue to wear masks and avoid crowds then of course they have lower infection rates.
18761,I want to see the infection rates for similar cohorts: people who don't wear masks and don't avoid crowds.

18765,Oh it absolutely would when they see their neighbor’s kid wheeled out in a body bag.
18766,The anti-vax parent has only been a thing because many of the serious illnesses that affect children are now so rare (thanks to vaccines) that you can not vax your kids and there’s a good chance they’ll be fine.
18767,If smallpox or polio was still going around this silly anti-vax parent movement would never have gotten legs.

18803,This is insane...
18804,I keep hearing a distinction between serious form of the disease and hospitalization.
18805,Does anyone know the definition of a serious infection that would not result in a hospitalization?
18806,I don't know how you can possibly blame humans when Covid has spread across the globe in the scale of hundreds of millions of infections.
18807,"No country has been able to go from widespread community spread to eradication, and countries that did keep initial infections low have *still* been struggling to keep it out (see: Australia) despite closed borders."
18808,"Additionally, most countries simply cannot just lock down indefinitely in hopes of eradication (see: most developing countries)."
18809,"And the vaccine does not prevent infection, so even if 100% of people got it, the virus would still be spreading."
18810,It's a highly infectious virus.
18811,We couldn't have done anything about it unless China had successfully contained it from the beginning and allowed help and collaboration from outside nations to support that venture.
18812,Are dorms not allowing  vaccinated people to socialize?
18813,What are the rules or restrictions in place that is stopping you from seeing others?
18814,There is no reason whatsoever for anyone vaccinated to be isolated.

18820,Antibody levels are way easier to measure.
18821,So.. medical fraud.
18822,These numbers are going to be a mess when scientists come to study the REAL impact of covid.

18834,"There’s always gonna be variants, it’s an endemic at this point."
18835,There’s no eradicating Covid.
18836,[removed]
18837,I see a lot of answers to your question pointing to behavior.
18838,"And while it’d be wonderful if we ended the deadly phase of this pandemic through vaccines alone, it seems highly probable that Delta *speeds up* the current phase of the pandemic (just in a dangerous way)."
18839,"Covid won’t be eradicated, but it will likely reach a point where it circulates much less and kills more rarely."
18840,"Vaccines are the best tool to get us there, but Delta has proven in every other nation where it became dominant that it is *highly efficient* at finding all of the “dry tinder” (people who have immune systems that aren’t primed for it)."
18841,"Once there’s little tinder left, it’ll drop to manageable numbers."
18842,Then the question will be how *we* respond to it being an endemic virus like all the  ~200 others in circulation.
18843,Do we really need to protect these people?
18844,It's not.
18845,HIPAA is not a magic shield that prevents non-healthcare employees from discussing contagious diseases.
18846,Yeah NVAX is making what you want.

18856,I do listen to them and I loved that episode and talked to the hiring manager about it.
18857,Its impossible to find people and some places are paying well over industry averages to get people.

18861,His friend's primary care physician told him it would be best not to due to his increased risk of adverse reactions.
18862,This is not a typical antivaxer.
18863,This is the reason why the rest of us that can NEED to vaccinate.
18864,This notion of boosters taking away from the rest of the world is dumb.
18865,"The reality is that shots, at least here in the US, are going to waste."

18915,It doesn't compare the total chances of each group.
18916,It only is about the ratio.
18917,"at 90% efficacy, if the chance for an unvaccinated person was 100% to get COVID, it would be 10% for a vaccinated person."
18918,"If the chance was 1/1,000th for an unvaccinated person, it would be 1/10,000th for a vaccinated person."
18919,"Again, it only tells you the ratio, NOT the actual chances."
18920,There are about a million expats living in China.
18921,"You can find them on Reddit, Twitter, Facebook, etc."
18922,"There are tens of millions of Chinese people living overseas, who talk regularly with friends and family in the country."
18923,And there are millions of Chinese people in China who use VPNs and are active on Western social media.
18924,It's not difficult at all to know what's going on in China.
18925,"If you're not convinced, the actions taken by the Chinese government are entirely consistent with what they (and everyone in the country who communicates with the outside world) are saying about the situation."

18944,This is what I’m trying to decide.
18945,Our school system is mandating masks for all students and staff except for PE class and after asking the school board how they’re managing lunchtime considering how packed and maskless 130 6th grader will be - the lack of an answer means no one even thought about the cafeteria.
18946,"Our county, like the rest of VA is 71% vaccinated 18 and up, and 54% estimated 12 and up."
18947,My wife and I are vaxxed as is the 7th grader.
18948,"And even though “studies show” a week recovery time for that kid, my wife and I neither want it or can afford to be sick ATM."
18949,September is going to be a shit show.
18950,"I read a great article from the BBC (maybe do a search on their site), highlighting research that suggests an 8-week hiatus as being the most effective."
18951,I think many of us are hoping so.
18952,"Currently the data shows a 3rd shit is safe, but nothing in regards to 2 a year going forward."
18953,[removed]
18954,[deleted]
18955,In fairness I do get wanting to keep your kids safe that’s obviously entirely understandable.
18956,But some people are taking it wayyyyyy too far and it only really seems to be Americans because the virus is so politicised there.
18957,Just strange seeing some of the most extreme views in the same country.
18958,On one hand people who won’t even do the bare minimum like wear a mask and on the other people not even letting there kids go to school and they’re living side by side with each other.
18959,"By contrast, in Europe near everyone wears a mask and everyone’s sending their kids to school."
18960,Not so much one extreme or the other.
18961,There’s plenty Americans like this too I’m sure just a bit food for thought.
18962,Then leave simple as that

18969,He’s better off for it.
18970,Offspring have been irrelevant for more than a decade.
18971,"They have found that Covid19 causes widespread vascular damage throughout the body, even in people with no symptoms."
18972,That's not good for a future prognoses.
18973,"It's very possible that someday, people who were infected and never even knew it will have organ damage, increased mortality, and decreased quality of life."
18974,"I'm not interested in any of that, long or short term."
18975,Im vaccinated and I’m in a study where they sent me home antibody tests.
18976,One month ago I was positive for antibodies and now I’m negative for antibodies.
18977,"Hey baby, let the bad time roll"
18978,&gt; At this point you will either get the shot or covid.
18979,Best to choose the shot.
18980,Well put.
18981,Why Don’t You Get A Jab
18982,"So long as the numbers get low enough,  and the transmission is low enough, it can die out, like polio."
18983,"Right now, numbers are so high, the transmission among vaccinated, while low as a percentage, is still high enough to be an issue."
18984,"Plus, currently the chance of additional mutations is high, which could be a real shit sandwich."
18985,"The thing is, if you are vaccine exempt from school and an outbreak occurs you cannot attend school until the outbreak resolves."
18986,"Usually it’s not an issue because there aren’t a lot of outbreaks, but when measles was spreading a few years ago the vaccine exempt kids who didn’t have the measles vaccine had to stay home from school in most places where the outbreak occurred."
18987,The non vaxxed people I know are “wait and see” types.
18988,Not political.
18989,I’m betting it’s 50/50 among the unvaxxed.
18990,[removed]
18991,Right…I bet they will try to shift funds there instead.
18992,It’s incredible how they’ve set them up to be responsible for the whole country’s outbreak.
18993,And I’ve heard nonstop comments echoing this!
18994,60% reduced risk of ANY infection including asymptomatic is very good.
18995,Symptomatic is likely much more.
18996,Incredible how this sub is filled with people who consistently see the negative no matter what’s in front of them.
18997,The addiction to fear is very real.
18998,Ahhhh so you don’t have kids!
18999,You will never understand the responsibility and the instinct that comes as soon as you become a parent to protect your kids at all cost.
19000,You just rather troll and think you’re smarter than those who actually raise their own kids instead of depending on others to raise their kids.
19001,And you as someone who faces discrimination for your LIFE CHOICES I would think you of all people would understand how annoying it is to have others who can’t relate weigh in on what you should be doing.
19002,I’d like to meet the person who proposed this study.
19003,[removed]
19004,It is not that simple when covid patients are taking up hospital beds
19005,He was born with that old man strength just like Chuck Norris.
19006,We were advised that vaccines were the end game.
19007,"Festivals, concerts and sports games all got approval from someone to go ahead at full capacity."
19008,Feeling the need to live life based on the perception of others—not your own risk profile or beliefs— is a direct result of how this pandemic has been handled.
19009,Go to the festival.
19010,"If not now, when?"
19011,I wouldn’t be surprised if another variant popped up next summer just in time to ruin it.
19012,Pretty fly for a vaccinated guy
19013,"yeah, one of the whole points of getting everyone vaccinated is to try and also cover people who can't have it for some reason or other, and it seems like he is one of those people."
19014,not liking the response here :/
19015,[removed]
19016,I was told that ID laws were racist and homophobic.
19017,My county BOE still hasn't said if they'll abide by CDC or AAP guidelines.
19018,I think they're waiting for our state to make a decision about mandates because they're basically a bunch of cowards.
19019,School starts in less than 2 weeks.
19020,That's awesome.
19021,That would be the ideal situation for most people.
19022,Unfortunately it's not the case in a lot of major cities in the US and other places like the UK
19023,"I really thought that once they see that kids are getting sick and being hospitalized, it would change their mind on mask mandates and vaccines, like Gov Hutchinson."
19024,Maybe there will be a few Republicans who are more interested in being good parents than following the party line.
19025,Survey also finds that water is wet and snow is cold.
19026,"Meanwhile, the Netherlands is decreasing the time between doses..."
19027,Just remember how many people did get vaccinated.
19028,"The number is still increasing (accelerating, even)."
19029,"Also, it’s impossible to get 100% of people to do anything."
19030,You seem to be missing the point.
19031,"Nobody wants a long war, but when the enemy doesn't give in, you are stuck in one whatever."
19032,I know one person out of dozens who have gotten vaccinated who also got covid.
19033,They’re my boss and since everyone has to be vaccinated here there is no longer a mask mandate so I’m the only person who still wore a mask all day.
19034,Once they got it everyone in the office went to get tested and no one else got it.
19035,"Further, my boss is fine and was back to work in a little over a week."
19036,"It just goes to show how effective the vaccines are at preventing what really matters, serious illness, hospitalization and death."
19037,"The vaccine also definitely helped prevent the spread because they either didn’t have enough viral load to transmit, everyone else was protected enough from the vaccine not to get it or most likely a combination of both."
19038,Without the vaccine everyone would have been much worse off.
19039,"There will be break through cases and they will likely increase as delta continues to spread but the vaccines still do what they were designed to do, save lives and limit spread."
19040,Hopefully the media will start reporting on the positives of the vaccines more to encourage people to get them because they do indeed work.
19041,[removed]
19042,Probably way less than most people think.
19043,"Ok, but the last 3 medical studies are saying far differently against delta…."
19044,"All of them pretty much confirm 
95% prevents severe illineas
88% symptomatic
63% asymptomatic per the Singapore, Canadian, and UK study…"

19046,Can someone write an extensive timeline of this guy's schooling?
19047,"Because from my Google search, it just says he went to one school for four years and got his PhD...how does that work?"
19048,"I'm assuming he never went to college straight out of high school because he was in the band The Offspring for so long, when did he have time to go to undergrad and wherever else needed to get a PhD before 2017?"
19049,"Cooking a burger correctly (medium rare) is pretty hard, too"
19050,"Here’s a good video of it

https://youtu.be/j-3Xa0ccM_Y"
19051,The number of TB cases in the US is under 10k annually.
19052,Why would you need to stipulate anything for such a disease?
19053,Compared to millions of cases and 600k deaths in a tear for COVID.
19054,Do you really not see the difference in numbers?
19055,I am not sure about the policies in different countries where TB is worse.
19056,I am talking about policy in the US.
19057,Stick to the topic.
19058,"In Oregon, you had to be VERY sick to be admitted."
19059,IE having a lot of trouble breathing.
19060,A village has 100 people.
19061,"99 are vaccinated, one is not."
19062,2 people come down with the virus.
19063,One is vaccinated.
19064,The accurate way to depict this situation is not “50% of infected people are vaccinated.” It is instead “&gt;98% of vaccinated people don’t get infected.”
19065,Let’s impose some stiff felonies for making fake vax cards and using them as well.
19066,Good summary of this subs since the beginning lol.
19067,I read the recommendation and it says they don't know so therefore they recommend getting it.
19068,But the science is saying natural immunity is very robust and long lasting and may be better than vaccine immunity.
19069,As many times as the CDC has messed this up I am going to trust my doctor first
19070,You'll need to be fully vaccinated.
19071,I read that Delta has pushed that up to closer to 90%
19072,"Criticism of China cannot be tolerated, please be a good citizen."
19073,Pretty sure no.
19074,"That notion seems to be largely from Reddit/Twitter from what I can tell, though it wouldn’t surprise me if the floodgates do indeed open more when it happens."
19075,"Guy on the right looks like he's about to tell someone to ""pop the trunk."
19076,"Do it."""
19077,"Even if it's true that only frontline workers are getting tested, heck *especially* if it's true, the rate of change in positivity is extremely important for detecting outbreaks early."
19078,"In this case, the positivity rate may not be representative of the population as a whole but its rate of change is a canary in a coal mine."
19079,Wastewater testing is another good example of this.
19080,It depends on which vaccine you are getting.
19081,I *think that current ‘optimal recommended gap’ for the AZ is 12 weeks while Pfizer is 3 and Moderna is 4.
19082,*Disclaimer.
19083,I could be wrong
19084,Someone should make a buddy movie about a big city doctor who returns to rural Georgia to do this with his old friend-turned-enemy who is also a doc but never moved out of town.
19085,It practically writes itself.
19086,Is the next variant going to be Delta Plus Ultra?
19087,"This, plus that analogy was pretty bad, equating having a covid symptom after 8 weeks to dying in a car crash."
19088,"There’s not even any guarantee that those symptoms are permanent either, just because they persisted for 8 weeks."
19089,"In fact I’m certain that some amount of them would not be, plus we know that vaccination can also help remove long term symptoms."
19090,This is not bad news.
19091,[removed]
19092,"So, someone had posted this - then deleted it when my comment started getting upvotes:

""following the popular choice Is this really the line you're going with?"
19093,It's recommended by health experts you drink several glasses of water a day.
19094,"Is it punk to stop drinking water because everyon... ""

I'm not going to call them out by name... but... e-mail notifications are forever."
19095,After reading the drummer's reasoning - I'm absolutely going with this line.
19096,"The fact that you didn't stand behind your post when it didn't turn out to be as popular as you anticipated, further proves my point about being influenced by PEER response."
19097,You had something to say to me - but when you saw I was getting support for what \*I\* was saying - it changed your mind about saying it out loud where other people could hear it.
19098,And this isn't a \*partisan\* perspective.
19099,"As another example, a conservative friend was complaining about an Olympian dropping out and complaining that she was pushed by her coaches and parents when she had a hurt leg in the last Olympics."
19100,His point was that she wouldn't have achieved a medal if it hadn't been for other people pushing her.
19101,"My rebuttal was, ""If the success didn't matter to her, she should have \*resisted\* being pushed by anyone but HERSELF."
19102,I used to have a coach that would berate and push me in several high school athletics.
19103,"""You could be the BEST if you just pushed yourself!"""
19104,"One day I flatly told him, ""What if I know my own limits best, don't push myself, and I'm happy with being ONE of the best."
19105,"What if being ""The Winner"" isn't important enough to ME in *this* contest?"""
19106,"Which is still a principle in my life - and why I post what I believe, and never delete a post that is getting downvoted."
19107,Because I'm not here to win social media contests and grow karma.
19108,I'm here to express my views - even ones that turn out to be unpopular on Reddit.
19109,That is something that seems largely missing for a whole generation who grew up on the instant feedback and dopamine-rush cycle of group affirmation through Likes and Thumbs Ups.
19110,"I'm not the first to note that a lot of people ""post for the Karma""."
19111,"Right now it is going on in r/BMW \- where for the longest time, everyone dog-piled on any posts about the M4 because it was guaranteed instant Karma to downvote that car."
19112,"Then people started getting sick of the dog-piling and started downvoting anyone who was band-waggoning on the M4 hate - and suddenly, most of the downvotes dried up."
19113,"This ""taking a side for the social benefits,"" thing goes beyond social media now - and affects ALL ideologies."
19114,"People pick their team or tribe, and they root for it to win - just for the WIN... just for the rush of victory - even if they know their team is deflating footballs, driving other cars off the track, or playing dirty politics."
19115,Being on the winning side is all that matters.
19116,"In the threads below, the people supporting the drummer took exception to his last line, ""That he supports people not taking the vaccine for \*whatever\* personal reason they decide not to."""
19117,Everyone supporting the drummer here all agreed that he had their support until he said this in the last paragraph.

19190,"I agree, mate."
19191,COVID is still novel; 25% of the population (ish) is unexposed and is vulnerable to both really high rates of spread and high hospital needs.
19192,Once that number gets lower then the risk of catastrophically fast spread will drop and it'll move into an endemic phase.
19193,Covid is not like any other illness - yet.

19238,&gt;  Or we can continue normalcy and the ones who are vaccinated will be fine if they get COVID.
19239,If you choose not to get it and you get really sick thats on them but it was their decision.
19240,I mean - that sounds good on paper except for the fact that our healthcare workers are over strained as is and have to deal with these yahoos.
19241,Oh and there's the 47 MILLION children who are under 12 years old in the US who are increasingly getting the disease as well.
19242,So their decision impacts everyone else.
19243,"I understand your point, however in a true worst case scenario..there are plenty of examples where great powers and professional militaries struggled or even failed against insurgent/rebel groups that were grossly outnumbered and outgunned

And to expand on that, any notion that would occur on US soil is terrifying and would probably not go how you think it would."

19263,I tend to agree with this.
19264,"I hate seeing those types of comments, presumably vaccinated people upset that other vaccinated people are trying to live their lives as best they can given the circumstances when that anger is misdirected."
19265,"You’re vaccinated, I’m not sure what else you can possibly do."
19266,"FYI, Vietnam received an additional 3 million more doses from the USA five days ago and stated they expect more from the USA in the near future."
19267,I just read about this and remembered your post.
19268,Figured I would give you an update.
19269,"I'm not defending him, but in Ireland (and Northern England where I lived for a few years) we use the term jab for the seasonal flu vaccine as well as COVID vaccines."
19270,Most of them are healthy and all work essential jobs.
19271,It's hard for some people to understand the big picture when over the past year and a half they had to obey extra safety precautions while customers violate their personal space and take masks off to talk to them.
19272,We are in a state with higher than average deaths but in our extended work family we have had no deaths and just a couple bad illnesses.

19283,"This autumn and winter will likely be painful, but after *that* there's good reason to believe that COVID will become an endemic virus comparable to flu that we will learn to live with."
19284,By this stage I recommend doing whatever makes you most comfortable and you should probably consider ignoring the news for a bit as well.
19285,It you take serious/critical cases and divide it by active infections you get your hospitalization rate.
19286,It’s less than 1% in the US and worldwide using world-o-meters numbers.
19287,Im assuming most of the cases and hospitalizations are unvaccinated.
19288,Not sure what to make of it.
19289,"Viral load is 1000x, not 1000% FYI."
19290,Otherwise - I agree.
19291,"Mild, in the context of COVID, simply means not hospitalized or dead."
19292,"It still captures the group of people who are having difficulty breathing,  gasping for air in the middle of the night, having 102+ fevers, experiencing brain fog and fatigue, and/or unable to taste or smell (potentially for months)."
19293,These are all miserable experiences but will be categorized as mild since these people are not hospitalized or dead.

19301,My primary told me he wouldn’t get the vaccine either with my history of GBS.
19302,It seems the CDC didn’t know this when they removed the mask advice for vaccinated people
19303,a high vaccination rate helps to fight the spread better than a higher vaccine effectiveness.
19304,Another one of those public health/individual health contradictions (which aren't really contradictions in the long run)
19305,The mRNA vaccines are also brand new technology that have never been used in humans.
19306,I was rejected for the Moderna trial because of my history of GBS so that didn’t exactly give me confidence.

19317,"If I'm going store to store or something like that I might exit one store, pull it down a little for when I'm just walking around outside, and then pull it back up when I'm headed back into the next store."
19318,"If I were just walking around I probably wouldn't wear it (yes fully vaxxed) but I'll respect the mask in the store, but don't want to wear it fully when walking around if not needed and it's hot out."
19319,But if you just saw me walking down the street at that point you'd probably say look at this jerk wearing his mask below his nose.
19320,"Yes, also true."
19321,Good point.
19322,Do you think the picture would’ve been different had we had a more transmissible variant like delta that could more easily “evade” a first dose in those early days?
19323,Israel actually stopped pretty early.
19324,Even now they're only at 59.5% fully vaccinated.
19325,On the 18th of April they were at 55% fully vaccinated.
19326,So their vaccine uptake has been dogshit for months.
19327,The US is at 50.3% fully vaccinated amongst the entire population.
19328,"This is correct, I homeschooled both of my sons through their last two years of HS when they encountered issues that precluded their attending brick and mortar (pre-pandemic)."
19329,"There are no forms to fill out, no agency telling you what to do/teach other than covering the same topics and standards as required for traditional graduation."
19330,Though nobody ever checked or asked.
19331,I still matched the courses they would have taken at brick and mortar though to ensure they were prepared well for their future endeavors.
19332,Both received diplomas from our homeschool and one has gone on to community college.
19333,The diploma and transcript were accepted no questions asked.
19334,Not sure if the protocol would differ for a more competitive college but test scores (SAT) would still be required in those instances.
19335,I have a history of severe anaphylaxis to a vaccine.
19336,I happened to be in a hospital emergency room when I was given a tetanus shot after an accident.
19337,"I immediately collapsed, experienced cardiac arrest and had to be resuscitated."
19338,To this day I'm traumatized from the experience and I have been advised not be vaccinated with the Covid19 vaccine.
19339,The misunderstanding and cruelty I'm experiencing because of this situation is horrible.
19340,I'm openly criticized by family and friends for not taking this risk.
19341,"'Oh they can save you if it happens again', they say......would you want to go through an experience like that......having your heart stop....feeling yourself die, literally?"
19342,It's horrific.
19343,"My husband has had both jabs and I drove him to the vaccine clinic and I sat in the car and jealousy watched people leave, vaccinated, with smiles on their faces."
19344,"I would love to confidently walk into a vaccine clinic, get the jab, and walk back out knowing I had some protection from this shitty virus."
19345,"But....no.....I have to put up with cruelty from people, sometimes people I barely know, because I'm afraid to go through another near-death experience....or worse, death."
19346,"And then you have the anti-vaxxer, anti-lockdown, anti-maskers, and people that generally think Covid is no big deal and 'why won't you go sit in a crowded restaurant maskless with us'."
19347,Fuck what a depressing 18 months this has been.
19348,Delta Plus is how you get Covid without the ads.
19349,Maybe those idiots should get vaccinated then?
19350,The overlap between people who have chronic mental illness and self-reported long Covid symptoms seems to be high.

19353,Would you support work from anywhere?
19354,"Go into the office five days a week if you want, or WFH five days a week if you want."
19355,I don’t think many people think it should be required to WFH - just given the option.
19356,&gt; If history is any indicator we’re a few months short of the halfway point on this thing.
19357,"but didn't you hear, people are tired, so it's over"
19358,That's great.

19370,"So why would COVID19 would be the exceptional case, as you're saying it?"
19371,Why would it go forever?
19372,It’s not technically allowed right now.
19373,I’d hold off a tad bit longer to allow regulatory agencies to catch up.
19374,The FDA is looking to give Pfizer full approval by the end of the monthl.
19375,"Once that happens, physicians will be all be to prescribe off label and give people 3rd doses."

I felt safe doing it with Israel, Germany, and UK rolling out third doses; and with pfizer set to request US authorization this month."

19571,"When people say the flu vaccine is 60% effective, they don’t really have to factor asymptomatic infections cause asymptomatic flu doesn’t exist (only presymptomatic)"

19573,I'm so confused as to why you are disagreeing with this.
19574,Efficacy is calculated by comparing data from the two groups.
19575,I'm not saying chances of getting COVID do not go up if there is more spread but I am saying the math is more complicated than a linear relationship.
19576,"Let say, hypothetically, for every 1 unit increase in transmission causes a 100% increase in infection among unvaccinated groups but only a 1% increase in vaccinated groups, then as rate of transmission increases, efficacy can actually rise."

19728,"Too be fair, my info is probably outdated, I used to work at a hospital as a Public Safety Officer and we where stressed a shit ton about HIPAA."
19729,So it’s prob because of the environment I was in to begin with.
19730,It’s a shame the same can’t be said about the vaccine.
19731,Tampa doesn’t…but we get dragged town but the rest of the state.
19732,"You gotta be kidding me, watch this version completely evade vaccines too.."
19733,"But the 100% is not the ""actual"" number."
19734,And are you saying that chances of getting COVID do not go up on average if there is more spread?
19735,Sure it can because we don’t know the herd immunity threshold since we don’t know how big previous outbreaks of asymptomatic cases ever were and if it can result in lasting immunity amongst unvaccinated.
19736,"There’s no real recognized number there, only assumed ones."
19737,They have been for over a year.
19738,"Hint: the vast majority of the ""Im vaxxed and I'm never wearing a mask and fuck everyone"" folks aren't vaxxed."
19739,How do I know..  the tone.
19740,"That hateful, angry, antisocial tone."
19741,People who wore masks didn't have that.
19742,Link broken?
19743,It's completely insane.
19744,"Covid is mostly harmless to children, and it is a disgrace that scared adults are forcing all these crazy measures on them because they themselves are scared of the virus."
19745,"While I appreciate his gesture, I am not extremely happy about submitting to this criticism."
19746,"We should not, as a society, get to the point where we are policing other private citizens' private events."
19747,"Legislators and those who make the rules, yes; they should be monitored to ensure they do not do the 'rules for thee but not for me' thing."
19748,"But a former POTUS is a private citizen - a celebrity, yes."
19749,But still a person who deserves privacy and to be trusted to make his own decisions.
19750,"They'l be shouting at him without a mask, i suppose."
19751,They track you through your insurance information moron.

19757,Long covid is mostly a myth.
19758,"As most infections, the severity of post-acute symptoms strongly correspond with the severity of the infection itself."
19759,Mild infection?
19760,No real long lasting symptoms.
19761,"Small studies based on self-reporting, self-selection and no control-groups that say otherwise are worthless."
19762,What matters are larger studies with better designs.

19766,I've seen people here in Georgia where there are no mask mandates wearing them around their chin.
19767,That's even more confusing!
19768,It would affect their ability to tour if he has to quarantine for 2 weeks everytime they cross a border.
19769,No fucking shit.
19770,This was obvious when they lifted the mask mandate by me in June.
19771,40% of adults were fully vaxxed but in the store only 15% were masked up.
19772,Same here with a difference.
19773,Where I work is a governamental office and those nuts are refused entry.
19774,Guess what...they learn immediatelly.
19775,"I think they put that down on all vaccines just in case, but mRNA is much safer for GBS (as in no cases linked to the vaccines so far)."
19776,"I mean, if he was REALLY that concerned, then of greater concern, he shouldn’t be exposed to random viruses at all."
19777,Lifelong quarantine.
19778,"Vaccines could trigger it, but it’s magnitudes lower than a person at the restaurant coughing near you with a random cold bug."
19779,Not just college students faking cards.
19780,Some employers are requiring vaccination to return to work.
19781,Anti-vax employees are making and circulating fake cards.
19782,I can only hope that they will be terminated when found out.
19783,"No, one year olds don’t need peers to develop socially—they just need family."
19784,Kindergartners are a different story.
19785,Ah damn… that sucks….
19786,Maybe CDC guidelines then?

19789,Color me shocked
19790,I'm fully vaccinated.
19791,Got a mild fever the day after the second shot.
19792,Was it a side effect of mr. Pfizer os was the all-natural organic free range SARS-CoV-2 virus in mild form?
19793,Who knows?
19794,And all my relatives are fully vaccinated.

19798,I dont disagree.
19799,People seem to be missing my point.
19800,"My point was not that the military should not mandate the shot, it was simply that mandating a shot for a large orgainization like this is a huge undertaking"
19801,[removed]
19802,"That's my biggest concern if my district goes to ""masks optional""."
19803,"If 75% aren't wearing them at all and staff aren't supporting the ones that do, is there really even much of a point?"
19804,"There's also going to be enormous pressure to not shutdown classrooms, quarantine, or contact trace this go around."
19805,It's going to be a mess.
19806,I wouldn't call it a contradiction.
19807,A higher vax rate leads to a higher overall effectiveness at least in the short time.
19808,Then in the long run there's not much difference between 95% and 99% assuming you reach that gets immunity.
19809,This.
19810,You're both vaccinated.
19811,"As long as the risk of contracting it is within your tolerance level, go and have fun."
19812,"Edit: If you want to be a good citizen, get tested when you come back and before you see anyone immunocompromised or under 12."

19819,So there are several studies that have looked at cases where people got GBS after Covid infections.
19820,What the study you’re linking to says is that the number of new GBS cases in the early months of Covid outbreak was less than usual.
19821,"That could be due to people not going to hospitals at the height of the pandemic unless they thought they would die (even then in cases), or it could be due to quarantine reducing exposure to other causes - like other viruses."
19822,[deleted]
19823,"As someone with MS, it sounds like the antithesis of MS."

19825,"They won’t because of all the tourism down to florida, and I’m sure many more complex reasons that I’m too dumb to articulate"
19826,Every parent I know has kids who know other kids who tested positive for covid.
19827,"None of them had concerning symptoms, even the unlucky toddlers who tested positive."
19828,These parents want their kids back in school and socializing with other children in a normal fashion.
19829,Kids can’t pause life like adults can.
19830,Not exactly say you only test 20 people 10 are positive you achieve the 50% positivity rate but what if it’s a small outbreak and no one else is tested that day or they were exposed under weird circumstances?
19831,You’re not testing wide enough portions of the population.
19832,From local data around here something like 80% of the tests on some days were from employer mandated testd many of which were hospitals.
19833,It’s not really a good control group.
19834,When has something been given to millions of people already and still not have final approval?
19835,They're taking too long.
19836,I have a friend who is stationed overseas.
19837,Apparently they got like a 90% vaccination rate on base by just telling them they could leave the base once they were fully vaxxed.
19838,"Yeah, I'll be cool with it as an endemic when vaccines are available for kids as young as 6 months."
19839,"But for now, we need to protect the vulnerable unable to get a vaccine."
19840,"Especially when it's a legit vaccine check

Not like music festival, show random piece of paper to a guard who has to watch 10k people a hour"
19841,I had that as my ringtone when I was like 12.

19865,Hm?
19866,Is this related to the article?
19867,Let me break it down for you.
19868,1.
19869,Vaccinated people can still catch COVID.
19870,It's just that the chances of you getting a severe case is much diminished.
19871,"The number of breakthrough cases, however, show that it DOES happen."
19872,2.
19873,Vaccinated people can still spread COVID.
19874,A large number of us have children too young to be vaccinated.
19875,"Oh sure, they're traditionally hit less hard."
19876,"Except some of us have children with respiratory conditions that are also associated with more severe cases, and we'd like our kids to not have to go to the ICU."
19877,3.
19878,New variants of COVID can reduce the vaccine's effectiveness.
19879,"The Delta variant, specifically, its both more severe and dramatically more infectious than the original, and is responsible for a number of vaccinated people catching COVID severe enough to be noticed and spread around."
19880,4.
19881,"The more COVID is spread, the more likely it is that more variants arise."
19882,So no.
19883,The pandemic is not over.
19884,Not yet.

19902,My band’s got a drummer man he hates that prick
19903,People should stop acting like testing positive for Covid is a death/chronic illness sentence.
19904,I'm not a vet or active military but I feel like with the impending approval and the history of many vaccinations being a part of the military that only a small chunk of guys will decide to nuke their career over this.
19905,"Perhaps it's a different perspective for those who serve or have served but I have seen a lot of ""it's the military you sign up to get stabbed"" from veterans so it seems sensical that the culture is there to just say it needs to get done and move on."

19910,And hopefully young kids get the approval before the December timeline too.
19911,Someone recently posted [this study](https://www.kff.org/policy-watch/covid-19-vaccine-breakthrough-cases-data-from-the-states/) that I saw and Figure 2 is about the simplest explanation possible if you're a visual person.
19912,It doesn't matter because there will always be people that will always have an excuse.
19913,"However, there *are* people waiting on full approval."
19914,The most important thing is that it removes legal barriers for mandatory vaccinations.
19915,"There is 100% certainty that in a hypothetical pandemic in which all people of all ages have the risk that kids have from covid 19, we'd have never done mask mandates, social distancing, remote schooling, or anything else."
19916,We'd have all shrugged and thanked the stars that we got so lucky that a novel virus was such little risk.
19917,That is **VERY** related

19924,Just checked my old elementary school is sept 2 this year.
19925,"Would have been insanely early when I was a kid, but pretty late by time I was in high school."
19926,"My old highschool is now sept 8, which is way late compared to what I had growing up."
19927,That’s what I commented on.
19928,To me the big thing is we were told minimal impact on droplets.
19929,COVID is aerosols.

19937,The US and EU are experiencing similar Delta wave situations at the moment.
19938,The EU has already opened to US travellers.
19939,The US is not open to EU travellers.
19940,"Same with the UK - UK is open to US travellers, but UK citizens cannot go to the US."
19941,I'm a little older than college age and what scares me are the long haul symptoms.
19942,"Yeah, most young people are back to normal in a few days but the chance of losing my smell and taste indefinitely or having long term respiratory symptoms is enough to motivate me to avoid getting sick as much as possible."
19943,Because that's a weasel word meant to give himself an out when people (rightfully) call him on his bullshit.
19944,20 weeks is not a long time.
19945,Do they specify if vaccine boosters will become available?
19946,Very well could be.
19947,"Trump is a self-centered asshole, who only cares about his own interests, but DeSantis continues to do shit that's only going to end with thousands more Republican voters dying."

20045,"But it's difficult to identify a difference in how Vietnam responded vs South American countries like Peru, or Argentina."
20046,"And the same goes for Cambodia, Laos, Brunei, Taiwan, Hong Kong, and many other countries."
20047,It's just much easier to deal with outbreaks in East Asia and Southeast Asia.
20048,Taiwan just had a major outbreak and brought it under control in 8 weeks with measures that simply did not work elsewhere in the world.

20060,The vaccine is fucking FREE wtf
20061,“But muh economy”
20062,Which is a HUGE dose.
20063,It's need to take 20 of the over-the-counter tablets I have to get to 100mg.
20064,That really seems like something that should be done under medical supervision.
20065,Following governmental guidelines is the new punk
20066,And greed.
20067,"The best way to reduce the numbers is to reduce the testing capacity, duh!"
20068,Remember when a world leader said something like that?
20069,This is from back in the SARS but obviously topical.
20070,"Back then we were advised masks barely matter for droplets, much less aerosols"
20071,"They use lockdowns, so they won't see anything like our numbers."
20072,But they will lie them down further anyway.
20073,"Think of it this way:

If you have a population of 1000 people, and you have 1000 doses - you can give everyone 1 dose, or half the people two doses."
20074,"Using Canadian (Ontario's specifically) data, they've shown one dose to be very effective at preventing serious disease, and even symptomatic covid."
20075,"This is even with Delta in the mix - Delta made it less effective, but it's not like it completely washed away that benefit."
20076,"In the end, if that entire population of 1000 people has partial protection, the herd immunity effect is going to play a larger part."
20077,"Using the U.K. as an example, when they had their most recent spike, it was very concentrated in the unvaccinated population (30s and younger)."
20078,"While it was less likely to kill, you could see their extremely high case counts."
20079,"Canada didn't really have the same thing play out - we've had Delta in my province for months, but it doesn't seem to really be doing the same thing here."
20080,"We now have a significant portion of our eligible population double vaccinated (12+, 81% with one dose, 71% with two) - but for a while it was quite uneven, something like 70% of the eligible with one dose before we really started on the second doses in earnest."
20081,"I imagine it's a combination of factors - we have (had) tougher restrictions, we still mask most of the time, but we also had the added benefit of a larger swath of the population with some level of protection via immunity, and then the wider gap between doses and the added benefits on top of that."
20082,"We've been hovering around 10 cases per 100k of the population for over a month now, even with Delta being something like 90% of all of our cases."
20083,"We still prioritized double dosing the vulnerable and health care workers quickly too, to ensure those who would get the highest viral loads and those who are likely to have the worst complications had the most protection."
20084,"I think any way you slice it, it's hard to see a mistake in our process, it's worked exceedingly well for us"
20085,It's almost as if it is mutating and effecting different parts of the population than it did when it first began.
20086,"Weird, who could have seen that coming?"
20087,Same.
20088,It's so frustrating!

20090,"The better question is, how is China going to **not** keep it under control?"
20091,The methods to control the spread of disease aren't mysterious.
20092,We understand them very well.
20093,"There's no need to ""find"" a way, the way is well-documented."
20094,The only practical question is how severe do measures need to be in any particular case at any particular moment.
20095,"Unfortunately, COVID-19 has shown us that the world is full of selfish idiots, both in politics and among the general population, who would prefer to die, and for a lot of other people to die too, rather than suck it up and do what has to be done to control the pandemic and protect the population."
20096,"Say what you will about the Chinese government, but they don't have time for this bullshit and the general population, even without an authoritarian government, is much more collective-minded than Western countries and are going to more readily cooperate with control measures, no matter how inconvenient they are."
20097,"The CCP will order lockdown the moment they think it's warranted, but also provide support for the affected population."
20098,"Wuhan was sealed, but the government was delivering food to the elderly and vulnerable so they didn't need to go out."
20099,"Mass testing and vaccination in China are not a question of if, but when and how fast."
20100,"While the efficacy of the Chinese-produced Sinovac and Sinopharm vaccines are somewhat less than the western variants, all the research has shown that it's much better to vaccinate more of a population with a somewhat less effective vaccine than less of a population with a more effective vaccine."
20101,"By rolling their own, China has total control over production and distribution and they've been pumping out their jabs and spreading them hard and fast."
20102,"Masks have been socially normalized in Asia for decades, so the government didn't even really need to order their use."
20103,The people masked up on their own.
20104,Anti-vaxx in China?
20105,You're out of luck.

20112,"A lot of countries would crawl over broken glass to get down the numbers of China's ""worst outbreak."""
20113,Unfortunately most of it is in the speculatory realm at this stage.
20114,Delta+ exhibits a mutation that was also present in Beta that experts believe provided Beta with some degree of immune evasion (not complete immune evasion either mind you).
20115,So there has been some concern that this would make Delta+ more infectious than the primary strain.
20116,"However, there's been some pumping of the breaks about just how infectious this variant may be, especially in relation to the primary strain."
20117,"Despite the presence of Delta+, it is still getting outcompeted quite heavily by the primary Delta strain suggesting the mutation does not really provide Delta+ much of an advantage, if any at all."
20118,"Additionally as far as we can tell to date, there is nothing that suggests Delta+ has any meaningful degree of vaccine evasion."

&gt;Effectiveness estimates always decrease as researchers include less serious disease."
20127,"""Vaccination remains highly effective against Delta,” said Imperial’s Paul Elliott, co-leader of the project."
20128,"No one is debating an increase in cases, and to repeat myself since it seems I also need ot copy and paste the article for you, I am more concerned about our under 12 population as they have yet to be vaccinated."
20129,"I was pleased to read there is still a relatively low chance of significant symptoms in children as described here:

&gt;They found that symptoms lasted for four or more weeks in 4.4 per cent of their group and for more than eight weeks in just 1.8 per cent."
20130,These figures are well below the 10 to 20 per cent levels frequently reported for adults with long Covid.
20131,"The symptoms reported most commonly in children were headaches, fatigue and sore throat."
20132,"""Many children who catch coronavirus don’t show any symptoms at all, and it will be reassuring for families to know that those children who do fall ill with Covid-19 are unlikely to suffer prolonged effects,” said Emma Duncan, senior author of the study which was published in The Lancet Child and Adolescent Health."
20133,"“Our research confirms that a small number do have a long illness duration with Covid-19, though these children too usually recover with time."
20134,"The most important finding is the low proportion that had persistent symptoms, the great majority of whom recovered by two months after illness,” said Russell Viner, professor of child and adolescent health at University College London."
20135,“This is much lower than reported in some other studies and is reassuring about the population burden of post-Covid symptoms in children and young people.”

* Protection against symptomatic infection (Delta): [AZ 67%, Pfizer 88%](https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/two-doses-pfizer-astrazeneca-shots-effective-against-delta-variant-study-finds-2021-07-21/)
* Protection against hospitalisation (Delta): [AZ 92%, Pfizer 96%](https://www.gov.uk/government/news/vaccines-highly-effective-against-hospitalisation-from-delta-variant)

So, by any reasonable definition, the reduction of “risk” for double-vaccinated people is by at least an order of magnitude and not by 50–60%."

20377,They had a gay love triangle in rural Georgia in the 1980s?
20378,I feel that might overshadow the rest of the movie.
20379,I was required to get the Hepatitis C shot before going to college.
20380,That was the only one on a list of like 5 other required vaccinations that I didn't yet have.
20381,"I didn't bat an eye then, I sure as hell won't now."
20382,"I took Pfizer back in April, even beating my parents to it by a couple of weeks, *way* before either the mask mandates came up or vaccine mandates were floated."
20383,"In theory, you'd expect a Covid vaccine mandate to become a non-issue once full FDA approval is given."
20384,"(I do understand why some people would in good faith be hesitant to agree to mandate an ""emergency use only"" vaccine.)"
20385,"But of course, we all know most people are just grasping for excuses."
20386,That was in January of 2020.
20387,"China locked down Wuhan at the end of January, so you've got your dates mixed up"
20388,This is the way.
20389,Thank you.
20390,Besides the loss of taste and smell I'm pretty much 95% fine now.
20391,Just feels like the lingering affects of a cold
20392,I feel like most people who are wearing masks and support mask mandates think of it as the very least you can do with no negative effects.
20393,"It's such a simple thing to do and if it helps even in the little bit, what's the big deal."
20394,The super majority of people that are against masks I have seen are doing it because of political reasons.
20395,So does this study contradict the recent news from the CDC regarding viral load in vaccinated individuals?
20396,I saw a chart that showed a faster decrease in viral load amongst vaccinated individuals vs non-vaccinated individuals.
20397,"It looked like both started with a similar viral load, but it dropped off much faster for vaccinated individuals."
20398,"I could very well be misunderstanding all of this, though…I have data fatigue at this point."
20399,I remember telling my family in mid March 2020 that this was different.
20400,I had just gone to Costco and bought my parents a bunch of stuff because I didn't want them going to the store.
20401,They thought I was nuts.
20402,Panic porn at its finest.
20403,7 day averages are down.
20404,"Sure, you like to see consistent declines, but a jump of 3-5K cases is not a reason to fear monger."
20405,We just now reached that threshold too.
20406,Vaccinations picked up after Delta started freaking a lot of holdouts out.
20407,"Great they got vaccinated, but too late to affect the current spike sadly."
20408,"Except water isn't wet, because it cannot be saturated with water since it is itself water :]"
20409,Right?
20410,This is one of those times where I'm not mad about missing out on easy money.
20411,Heard immunity means we would see localized breakthroughs that don't continue to propagate through the population.
20412,That's not what we are seeing in the U.K. for example.
20413,Even vaccinated individuals are spreading it to more then 1 person on average.
20414,"Correct me if I'm wrong, but I believe in the UK there was 1) a big push to get everyone the first shot (pumping up the need for the first shot and probably referring to that first one as ""the vaccine"")  2) There are no one-shot vaccines there (where as in the U.S. we have J&amp;J so more likely to say fully than ""double"" as it doesn't need to be double."

20458,"So *some* dead kids are okay, as long as it's not most of them?"
20459,Masks/mask mandates are not political.
20460,But those who encourage people to push back against common-sense public health measures are **making it political** for their benefit.
20461,"None of use think we're heroes, we're just sick of COVID-19."

20463,Ok but we're throwing thousands of doses away due to expiration.
20464,I don't see how allowing me or anyone else a booster is worse than that (talking about the USA only)
20465,"This is one of those situations where everyone has to define what the ""right"" thing to do is."
20466,"We all care about other people, just at varying degrees."
20467,Especially if it comes at our own expense.
20468,"This seems much more widespread than in the initial outbreak, so it is hardly a repeat."
20469,Their task is much harder this time.
20470,There are hundreds of cases across nearly all provinces.
20471,"However the fatality rate is also minuscule, probably because 1.6B doses of vaccine have been administered."
20472,It might be that the delta variant is simply too infectious for the Chinese strategy to eradicate it.

20496,This is usually the baseline tbh.
20497,Yay administrators.
20498,You guys are incredibly hypocritical.
20499,"Yes, that’s entirely possible."
20500,But the chances of a vaxxed person with Covid giving to another vaxxed person is slim.
20501,"And if you happen to be one of the unlucky ones and catch Covid and are symptomatic, your level of sickness should be low as compared to an unvaxxed person catching Covid."
20502,"I understand the quandary, but so few kids die and/or are hospitalized of covid in relation to other mild illnesses and other causes of death that it's effectively marginal in comparison."
20503,rant away.
20504,I'm at the end of my rope.
20505,Clients just walking in with no appointments.
20506,Friends who definitely know my stance on the subject trying to just stop by or get into my house to hang out.
20507,Which is essentially when these deaths are from due to the lag.
20508,This week will be quite high (but still a tenth of last waves) before dropping again.
20509,"I, for one, am shocked at these unexpected findings"
20510,"As to point 2, the government (the judicial branch) limits people's ability to travel all the time."
20511,"I believe the federal government could stop planes and busses and other travel, it's more a question about what circumstances would be necessary to constitutionally justify it."

20539,The device you made this snarky comment on is a result of many failed hypothesis.
20540,Be grateful.
20541,The reduction in the risk of *infection* is 50-60%.
20542,The reduction in *hospitalisation* and *death* is much higher than this.
20543,Hopsitalisation risk is reduced by 94% and death by 97% (not this study - from previous analysis of Delta variant cases).

20569,"I was thinking of getting tested the day I head out as I work in an office, quarantine in a separate house for X amount of days and then get tested again with one of those at home tests (to rule out me catching covid the day of getting tested and it incubating)."
20570,How many days should I space between my tests?
20571,Are those at home tests even accurate?

20576,The alternative was to ignore the science at the time that said that vaccinated people rarely spread the virus and get accused of “ignoring the science”.
20577,It was a no-win situation for the CDC.

20618,"People like DeSantis, McConnell know how the game is played"
20619,This is 100% natural selection in action.
20620,I been saying this since day one vaccines aren’t 100% effective if we mix vaccinated people and unvaccinated people together and when we account for a virus like covid that can make 1billion copies of its self per infection we are talking a big chance when we get into more population dense areas where a break though mutation could occur that is equally as fatal to a unvaccinated person as it is to a vaccinated person.
20621,Its only a matter of time till it happens be it 1 month to 36 months Covid is here to stay and till it has 100% no hosts to infect it will be around.
20622,This is a bigger problem.
20623,I honestly wouldn’t care if the government passed a Bill allowing employers to vet people based on vaccinated status depending on the job category or if vaccination record became public file like a criminal record.
20624,This May seem to impinge on god given rights of the decoration of independence and HIPPA  however we really need to think of the death toll and the bigger picture.

20641,Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) if you have any questions or concerns.
20642,*
20643,Please be careful about a statement like this.
20644,"There is no research that says long Covid is worse in anyone with Delta, much less kids."
20645,"Okay, and if we have Delta ravaging us at the same time because of waning immunity we’re still screwed, just sooner."
20646,One of these situations we know we can control and the other we’re hoping doesn’t happen.
20647,"as some who has attended an Ivy, let me tell you money and legacy are more important than brains."
20648,BECAUSE THEYRE IDIOTS!
20649,"I’ve been fully vaccinated since February, have returned mostly to normal since then, and have been at work full time since May 2020 but continue making assumptions."
20650,"It is, but I would be very surprised if the same patterns aren't true of Delta, though the numbers would surely be different."
20651,"From what I've read it seems Delta is more transmissible than Alpha but doesn't really result in increased severity of disease, just more cases in general (which results in more potential severe infections)."
20652,"Exactly, we have an 11 y/o at home and even though the wife and I are vaccinated, it doesn't change a damn thing until our kids can be protected from this virus!"
20653,"Wake up, people."
20654,"I'd love to see it, but the backlash would be incredible."
20655,Over a million tourists per week travel to Florida.
20656,That's a lot of pissed off voters.
20657,Doubt any politician has the stones.
20658,No it will not help much and i am seeing high non compliance with NYC covid vaccination proof.
20659,Especially in such area as Bronx
20660,Asymptomatic Covid doesn’t mean there’s nothing happening under the hood.
20661,There have been 20 year olds going to the ER with a stroke only to find out they have asymptomatic covid.
20662,There are other examples as well….
20663,I’m only saying this because a lot of people think that no symptoms means nothing bad is happening.
20664,That isn’t quite the case with Covid.
20665,"So get vaccinated, rock a mask in crowds, and maybe try not to get infected at all."
20666,No no no a guy on yahoo answers told me it was bad.
20667,What do scientists know
20668,&gt; This breakdown is probably useful in some way to the China CDC.
20669,I have no doubt it is useful to the PRC CDC.
20670,Right.
20671,I'm researching the best masks to get now.
20672,The cloth ones work great when EVERYONE wears them.
20673,"But, when not everyone does, you need to move to a medical-grade 95 mask."
20674,I'm having a hard time finding them in children's sizes from legit medical supply companies.
20675,I misplaced my vaccine card (DOH!).
20676,Will Walgreens write me a new one?
20677,I have the picture of the card with my lot numbers and everything on my phone still.
20678,"Let's send the delta-anti-vaxxer-unnecessary-outbreak stimulus payment now please, rather than 3 months after everyone needs it."
20679,Agree... And declaring bankruptcy isn't the end of the world either.
20680,Feeling like shit and being disabled (can't work) is far more scary to me.
20681,"Yeah, he knows exactly what he's doing."

20683,&gt; They wouldn't be doing that if the data weren't favorable.
20684,"But in the context of the thread:

&gt;&gt;&gt;They wouldn't be doing that if the data weren't favorable."
20685,People are asserting taking a 3rd dose of current formulation is safe and effective based upon the idea Pfizer proposed it after testing.
20686,"That's incorrect, because Pfizer is proposing a new formulation after testing."
20687,"That doesn't prove the a 3rd dose of the current formulation is not safe and effective, but means it is untested beyond whatever Israel is relying upon to justify using it in the over-65 sub-population."
20688,Not looking forward to the Omega variant.
20689,This.
20690,"If we're about to lose them, anyway, let's put them in arms."
20691,"If there isn't enough time to send the excess out of the country, then use them here, especially for the immunocompromised."
20692,Best way to fix climate change.
20693,Can’t have a carbon footprint if ya dead.
20694,Still willing to take the risk of getting the virus.
20695,Do I still have a choice in the matter?
20696,Do I have the freedom to catch covid and get natural immunity?
20697,"I don't live with anyone at risk, and if I had symptoms I'd quarantine/mask up."
20698,The recently published data show good persistence of protection so far.
20699,"I think boosters should only be offered to the most vulnerable, right now."
20700,Amurrica
20701,Exactly.
20702,"Free, fast, walk in testing is still available everywhere here."
20703,It’s for easy access and makes taking it on and off easier.
20704,Pull it down if no ones around.
20705,Pull it over if you’re near another.
20706,"The drums you won’t play, Paaraadaaadaa, Parada why don’t you get a jab?"
20707,"And yet, according to research done, which you can read about in the article above, the vaccinated are *still* more likely to wear masks than the unvaccinated."
20708,Of course.
20709,"Because to them it's all related: vaccines are a conspiracy to them (remember Trump told them it was from the beginning, downplaying it's seriousness), so wearing masks are useless plus they deprive them of their ""freedom"" to reject logic in favor of self-righteousness, pride, and a way to show support for Trump's ""stolen"" election loss."
20710,"Taking that raw emotional ""logic"" a step further, why would you avoid crowds when to them there is no pandemic, since it's just ""the flu,"" the election was stolen by poor Donald Trump who just can't seem to get a break and he said as much repeatedly, and masks deny them of their ""freedom"" to show ""independence"" and a way to get back at The System."
20711,"Florida Man, Florida Man."
20712,"Doing the things, Florida Can."
20713,Get in a Fight.
20714,Covid Wins.
20715,Florida Man.
20716,Florida Man.
20717,The CDC use case regarding viral load and transmissibility was specifically among vaccinated people who were infected.
20718,"The vaccine still provides a level of protection from infection, though obviously it’s not 100%."
20719,"Doesn't make sense... and yet, it does."
20720,[removed]
20721,"I think that if anyone could host a COVID-safe gathering, it would be Obama who has access to the best experts and medical advice."
20722,But it is also important to think of the message it sends.
20723,"A lot of people will see this and think, ""Oh, these are rules for *me*, but not for *thee*,"" without taking into account all the factors."
20724,"And it has been true that the rich and powerful have been able to get better equipment and care than regular people, though this is certainly not unique to COVID."
20725,And I think Obama is reacting to those concerns.
20726,"Because like it or not, he's still going to be an easy target for people on the right, and I think he doesn't want to do damage to the effort to get people to actually follow guidelines."
20727,It's really not all that confusing: it's stupidity.
20728,I’m with you.
20729,"Until then, my household will continue to play it safe until our toddler can be vaccinated, too."
20730,"They don’t have the GOP, it’s as simple as that, there are conservative governments over there but no malevolent manipulating conservative ones."
20731,"Edit: If this gets deleted by the mods is going to be fairly upsetting, let’s talk about a pandemic but not the people that are prolonging it?"
20732,Why?
20733,"I hate the new covid, the always rude covid"
20734,There absolutely is magic when the virus has to behave completely different in China than elsewhere.
20735,It somehow appears to be far less contagious.
20736,It is magic.
20737,"Also, it began with one person is lunacy."
20738,Unless of course that one person is patient zero ( hint: he is not).
20739,The virus is only detected after the patient is already being contagious and has infected others.
20740,"Again, the numbers only work with magic."
20741,I’d love the US to start doing tax penalties to those refusing to vaccinate.
20742,It totally relates.
20743,If they said keep wearing masks than in my state people would still be wearing masks.
20744,Ummm... no shit?
20745,Yeah.
20746,A lot of people i speak to talk of the 50 million who died during the Spanish flu.
20747,They don't realize that 100 years of medical advances have kept people alive who would have been dead back then.
20748,Yeah!
20749,Because most hospitals aren't already facing staffing issues!
20750,Okay cool I read it.
20751,Let me ask a question.
20752,So Pfizer was 94% effective against the original covid.
20753,Is the this article stating that Pfizer is 60% effective against the delta variant?
20754,It's insane they are not producing and distributing rapid tests for home use for free
20755,I think you've misread the document.
20756,&gt;  the PRC is the only country (AFAIK) that doesn't count asymptomatic cases.
20757,It counts and reports them.
20758,"It just does a more detailed breakdown than most countries do, reporting symptomatic and asymptomatic infections separately."
20759,[deleted]
20760,Had a maskless guy in Walmart freakin out while talking on his phone because he couldn't find any employees to help him that weren't wearing masks.
20761,He was screaming that he was about to go ballistic on everyone.
20762,It was so scary.
20763,Ok thanks I’m deleting that link
20764,"725,000 new shots, 493,000 first shots."
20765,"Slightly lower then last week (498,000) but still stable numbers."
20766,3.1 million first shots in the last week.
20767,"WH Covid Tracker says that the increase started 4 weeks ago, so we potentially could see a noticeable increase in fully vaccinated adults shortly."
20768,"I guess we lost the plot on COVID-19, cases don't matter its hospitalizations and deaths but keep up with these talking points, soon enough you will have literally no one following any of these guidelines."
20769,Its all a funny joke until you go to the hospital and its a 15 hour wait because they are so short staffed
20770,I imagine is grounds for termination if you lie about something like that
20771,Multiple citations needed.
20772,That’s all nonsense.
20773,You don’t understand any of this.
20774,Stop asserting bullshit.
20775,Agree.
20776,Would be hard to draw a conclusion without seeing some of the data specifically.
20777,They could just be different ways of looking at the same general data.
20778,"At this point, I doubt it is a conclusive contradiction."
20779,"It's their choice, however I suspect the vast majority of businesses that have been devastated over the last 2 years don't want to turn away potential customers."
20780,“We’ve done our part” may come back to bite us when a new fancy variant is on our doorstep again.
20781,Bizarre ass comment
20782,Ya don’t say?
20783,The US has already donated a bunch of vaccinations to other countries.
20784,Other countries need to step up and build up infrastructure.
20785,The US has done enough.
20786,But won't cuz Darwin Variant.

20955,They specifically told me not to put anything in the window to the pharmacist.
20956,Who?
20957,"Children, who have outcomes on par with a typical flu?"
20958,All unvaccinated and aged 50s-70s according to the article.
20959,"Yeah, that went out the window for me in the 90's with the advent of usenet."
20960,It was clear we were doomed.
20961,https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2021/07/when-will-covid-19-vaccines-be-fully-approved-and-does-it-matter-if-they-are
20962,"Hmm.. 

1."
20963,What is Polio?
20964,- Polio is a disease caused by a virus that lives in the human  throat and intestinal tract.
20965,It is spread by exposure to infected human stool: e.g.
20966,from poor sanitation practices.
20967,"The 1952 Polio epidemic was the worst outbreak in 
the nation's history."
20968,"Of nearly 58,000 cases reported that year, 3,145 people died and 21,269 were left with mild to disabling paralysis, with most of the victims being children."
20969,"The ""public reaction was to a plague"", said historian William O'Neill."
20970,"""Citizens of urban areas were to be terrified every summer when this frightful visitor returned.” A Polio vaccine first became available in 1955."
20971,2.
20972,What are the symptoms of Polio?
20973,"- Up to 95 % of people infected with Polio virus are not aware they are infected, but can still transmit it to others."
20974,"While some develop just a fever, sore throat, upset stomach, and/or flu-like symptoms and have no paralysis or other serious symptoms, others get a stiffness of the back or legs, and experience increased sensitivity."
20975,"However, a few develop life-threatening paralysis of muscles."
20976,"The risk of developing serious symptoms increases with the 
age of the ill person."
20977,"TO REPEAT: 

-Up to 95 % of people infected with Polio virus are not aware they are infected,

- ""only"" 3,145 people died in the WORST OUTBREAK."
20978,Yeah.
20979,You may be right.
20980,This may be a shitty comparison.
20981,Thanks for sharing this.
20982,So hopeful and I wish all states would track this.
20983,People need to see how effective the vaccines are!
20984,\&gt;I wish we could push for people to get vaccinated and forget about masks.
20985,Focusing so much on masking is how we got in this mess.
20986,Most people wouldn't have minded wearing a mask to Target while we waited for vaccination rates to get past 70% and the ones who did mind weren't wearing them anyway.
20987,The problem is that the CDC has very few goals or plans for dealing with COVID long-term and what little they do have is horribly conveyed to the public.
20988,"They haven't even said, ""Once this surge ends, people can demask again so keep masking while the surge continues."""
20989,"That may not be the best advice, but it's better than acting like we should be wearing masks everywhere indefinitely."
20990,I got J&amp;J too.
20991,I wouldn’t worry too much.
20992,It even says in the article that they approved it due to a high amount of requests but that the J&amp;J is still very effective at what it’s intended to do.
20993,My state doesn’t allow for additional shots yet if you have the J&amp;J so it’s not even a option for me.
20994,"If people with the J&amp;J were getting seriously ill &amp; dying more so than the other vaccines, there would be enough data to support that by now."
20995,Right now it seems like it may be the least effective at stopping Covid outright but that is about it.
20996,"If it’s any consideration, everyone I personally know with a breakthrough infection got the Pfizer vaccine."
20997,"Might as well be white supremacist if they vote conservative, they obviously hate their own race"
20998,50% efficacy against twice as infectious variant...it's as infectious as being unvaxxed last year assuming same community spread.
20999,But good news guys!
21000,"No matter how hard he tries, fully vaccinated people will go out and live their live, except for those in this sub"
21001,"Oh yep, thanks for the correction!"
21002,She is very stylish about it though.
21003,Got a bedazzled eyepatch when her vision was all wonky haha
21004,This is a good question that I'd like to hear a competent individual answer...
21005,"I seem to remember this being proposed before, but not addressed."
21006,How any employee could step into the ER waiting room and NOT immediately book their vaccination is wild.
21007,"Saw 5 people in a 7 hour span stumble in, gasping for air, and being rushed through ahead of people waiting 10+hours."
21008,People sitting around in the ER hooked up to oxygen.
21009,How do you see that and still just shrug it off.
21010,"Fun fact, they made me sign a waiver acknowledging that they were following CDC guidelines."
21011,There was covid positive people sitting 2 feet away from others.
21012,People were packed next to each other.
21013,"If it makes you feel better the current thinking and data is that the younger the child, the less at risk."
21014,The ACE2 receptor in which the virus primarily binds to is a maturity antigen.
21015,The young have less or none of these receptors which doesn’t give the virus as much to attach to.
21016,"That is from 2018, based on 2006 - 2017."
21017,The laws changed again in 2021.
21018,Chapter 7 no longer exists.
21019,This is stupid.
21020,The WHO shouldn’t try to micromanage a global vaccine rollout.
21021,Yes rich countries are getting double vaccinated while poorer countries are struggling to get supply.
21022,No the WHO pleading for some redistribution strategy isn’t going to help things.
21023,Supply is increasing every day and the world is getting vaccinated.
21024,The WHO should just focus on continuing to keep supply coming to poor countries.
21025,Not shaming countries for receiving vaccines.
21026,[removed]
21027,Oh no problem.
21028,I just didn’t want people to think there were two of the same outbreaks.
21029,That’s gets overwhelming.
21030,"If GOP expelled the crazy, there wouldn’t be much left afterwards at this point."
21031,"Look what happened to Romney for going up against the crazy, for example."
21032,I don't think it's mutating faster than the flu.
21033,"Keep in mind the difference between *strains* and *variants*; everything we've heard about covid mutations is all the same single strain, Covid-19."
21034,"When you hear about flu mutations, you're talking about completely different strains, not even factoring in different variants among those strains."
21035,"I'm not an epidemiologist or anything like that so it's possible that I'm way off base here, but I was under the impression that once Delta has passed, another variant will come along and take its place, and then another variant will come after that, and then another, ad infinitum."
21036,Is there any reason to believe that we won't all be dealing with this in some form or another for the rest of our lives?
21037,"Not trying to fearmonger here, I genuinely don't know."
21038,I thought the best we could hope for was vaccines and treatments which simply make it another routine illness like a cold.
21039,The previous exposure to influenza would have prepared the immune systems of the elderly to protect them.
21040,Like a vaccine does.
21041,Yes it hard to hear the sarcasm in your voice jeez
21042,Wishing isnt saving anyone.
21043,"A fear monger, thats why people (some people) love him"
21044,Exaggerating a comparison doesn't save lives
21045,I really think we’ll get through this.
21046,"Sometimes I remind myself that the saying “darkest before the dawn,” though maybe a little cheesy, contains quite a lot of wisdom when it comes to cycles in life."
21047,Be well.
21048,"Not disagreeing with you, but just because there are more articles stating it’s safe, doesn’t exactly mean that implicitly, it’s safe."
21049,We have no long term studies to back that up.
21050,"The biggest argument from the other side I can understand is that we simply do not know what will happen down the line, and the skepticism is healthy I feel."
21051,"We shouldn’t all just blindly follow what the masses say... 


Of course you can counter that, by stating that the possible effects are severely reduced when you’ve taken the vaccine, however that doesn’t say anything to the point that, again, we simply have no concrete way of knowing with absolute certainty what will happen (even down the road) when it’s taken."
21052,"So, because of that, I can understand people’s reluctance to get the vaccine."
21053,[removed]
21054,Your kids will definitely be getting delta variant at public schools.
21055,So I guess it comes down to personal choice on if that's something you're okay exposing your kids to.
21056,"&gt; Los Angeles will consider a proposal to require proof of COVID-19 inoculation as a condition of entry at a host of indoor public spaces in what, if passed, would be the widest-ranging vaccination-verification effort in the city yet."
21057,"&gt; The motion, introduced Wednesday by council President Nury Martinez and Councilmember Mitch O’Farrell, would require eligible individuals to demonstrate that they’ve received at least one vaccination dose to visit indoor places such as restaurants, bars, retail stores, gyms, spas, movie theaters, stadiums and concert venues."
21058,"&gt; “Enough is enough already,” Martinez said in a statement."
21059,"“Hospital workers are exhausted, moms who have put aside their careers are tired, and our kids cannot afford the loss of another school year."
21060,"We have three vaccines that work and are readily available, so what’s it going to take?"
21061,"Our kids are about to return to school, and the unvaccinated are putting their lives at risk every day."
21062,"Ask your questions, talk to your doctor and get the vaccine."
21063,Let’s put this behind us.”
21064,How is it not?
21065,[deleted]
21066,It is not a surprise what is occurring in the UK.
21067,"India's curve was the same, and they did not even have vaccines."
21068,Delta transmits through communities quickly.
21069,I look forward to when scientists have an explanation.
21070,Isn’t the way viruses work a complex and often misunderstood concept?
21071,"Mixed with the rapidly spreading delta variant, more people in the US will have natural and vaccine immunity than ever before."
21072,"That may mean a horrible wave is ahead, but after it subsides, the the immune system often have a memory to combat future variants, even if it’s not 100%, to make the virus turn into a much more manageable common cold like illness mixed with yearly boosters?"
21073,I feel like all we talk about are worse case scenarios that still have never happened.
21074,Just halfway scenarios.
21075,It seems like part of the problem is news articles with titles like these.
21076,Debate implies that there are multiple sides threatening violence.
21077,There are not.
21078,Imagine being a teacher in a room of unmasked kids who can’t be vaccinated.
21079,They don’t pay teachers enough
21080,I’m not so sure that this applies to fans.
21081,Other articles about this seems to indicate that this only applies for staff and that individual tracks set the rules for spectators.
21082,Could be wrong though.
21083,Oh it is.
21084,"Unfortunately, we had picked our date back in 2019 well before covid."
21085,Sigh.
21086,Yes.
21087,How dare we...  *checks notes* ..  try and save lives.
21088,What a monumental bunch of assholes we are.
21089,Their unvaccinated children?
21090,There are new flu strains every year.

21109,But I’m not going to ignore this either.
21110,I’ve got loved ones with underlying conditions.
21111,What?
21112,"Why do you think ""jab"" an antivax thing?"
21113,Fire him for falsifying government records.

21115,"Shit, good thinking"

21117,Congress can barely decide that we should pay for roads.
21118,What makes you think they would do anything in support of a vaccine passport?
21119,And you remember “death panels”?
21120,This would somehow be construed as something even worse.
21121,"Furthermore, even if Biden mandated vaccine passports, it would be tied up in courts forever if it wasn’t struck down by Trump’s judicial appointees immediately."
21122,Thanks!
21123,And we should listen to you over doctors seeing it with their own eyes?
21124,How would Anhui or Chongqing get any cases?
21125,"For most of the last year and a half, there simply have not been any infected people in China."
21126,An infected person needs to get into the country in order to set off an outbreak.
21127,"To get into the country, you have to get a negative test before your flight, then go through a 2- to 3-week quarantine confined in your room in a designated quarantine hotel, then test negative again before being let out of quarantine."
21128,They don't even let you travel to the hotel yourself.
21129,You're taken there directly on arrival.
21130,The only times that cases pop up in China are when there's a breach in this system.
21131,"There's always a massive response when that happens, though, and that has worked so far to keep nearly every outbreak localized in a small region."
21132,Ehh.
21133,Michigan's Upper Peninsula which voted for orange guy is looking pretty good.
21134,"Wayne County,  a bastion for the new guy, not at all."
21135,I don't think it is that easy.
21136,"I’m not trying to be one of those types, but a lot of those articles have a specific bias, if you know what I mean."
21137,People want to stay afraid man.
21138,"""Children of all ages can be infected with the coronavirus."
21139,"But the new CDC report shows that older children and adolescents are more at risk for developing deadly complications, including multisystem inflammatory syndrome and respiratory failure."
21140,The report analyzed data about the 121 children who died from COVID-19-related illness between February and July.
21141,"Of them, 70% were between the ages of 10 and 20."
21142,"“The youngest children seem to be most protected from this virus,” Dr. Sabella says."""

21160,Delta already seemed to dodge or resist immunity from earlier strain infections.
21161,The CDC slides indicated reinfection from delta to delta was possible but on a timeframe like six months that probably won’t happen since it’ll have just hit all the unvaccinated people and died out by that point.
21162,At that point it might just be plain old fashioned stupidity.
21163,DeSantis bragged today about standing in the Federal government's way of trying to slow down the spread in Florida.
21164,It's really a sick that people like DeSantis haven't been prosecuted yet.
21165,He's literally guilty of mass negligent homicide.
21166,YOU READ THE STUDY!!!
21167,WONDER WHO'S THE MUPPET.
21168,"&gt;1734 children (588 younger and 1146 older children) had a positive SARS-CoV-2 test result

#1734 tested positive
#77 had covid long
#77/1734 =  0.04466"
21169,OMG that's just so horrible.
21170,You must be worrying about having to postpone it yet again.
21171,There is zero need to PCR following antigen.
21172,Antigen positive means you are infectious.
21173,Fair enough I am speaking from the US perspective.
21174,&gt;I'd rather give it [the vaccine] to people who need it.
21175,I don't need it.
21176,"I'm a healthy, young individual that will continue to work on my health."
21177,that is some very strange logic.
21178,it makes no sense.
21179,everyone needs it
21180,It seems the CDC never had a good understanding of the anti-vaxx culture.
21181,"Yep, totally agree."
21182,"If someone has been anti mask, they probably aren’t going to get the scary government juice injected into them."

21195,Now it’s a mainstream opinion.
21196,Yeah as someone who has loved ones with pre-existing conditions.
21197,I’m not about to ignore that.
21198,There's widespread immunity among the population of most countries.
21199,Unless you're still clinging to the hope that we'd somehow eradicate this thing -- a ship that sailed over a year ago -- there's very little left to do except let those who choose infection over vaccination meet their fate.

21209,"We were supposed to head for our Disneyworld trip this year (we are from Canada) even if our borders were open at this point Flordia is off the table, and we are both vaxxed."

21218,Does she do this because she doesn't care or she doesn't know better or some kind of protest?
21219,"Yeah, it’s bleak but the notion delta may not be here for that long because the spike is so steep and it burns through its fuel so quickly may help us in a way."
21220,This will continue to cause a large amount of mortality in the US for the next couple of years.
21221,My guess is that by January of 2023 we will have 2 million official deaths and 5 million when considering excess deaths and deaths that resulted due to being scared infection from going to the doctor along with inadequate medical attention since all of the beds are consumed by COVID patients.
21222,"I can't tell you the number of times that I have sent emails to people, trying to keep it short, and putting the most relevant details at the top of the email, only to have them reply asking a question that is specifically spelled out in the email."

21235,I work for Toyota North America.
21236,Mask mandate is back on tomorrow regardless of vaccination status.
21237,I am glad you are feeling better.
21238,Covid did a number on my mental health last year also.
21239,I've said more than once the two hours after I got my second vaccination shot may have been the two most carefree and magical hours of my life.
21240,It won't so long as the rest of the world is also a petri dish.
21241,"And ""vaccinate the world"" isn't even a discussion in the USA right now."
21242,Yeah I personally don’t know what to think of this.
21243,Like I’m not a scientist at all.
21244,"It’s supposed to be 90% effective, depending on the vaccine, but after repeated exposures over days, did they just hit that threshold and get it?"
21245,I hope you’re right!
21246,"The media is already already fear (whether justified or not, idk yet) about the Lambda variant."
21247,Yup.
21248,One leads to the other and they have no lead time now.
21249,Weren’t they older/had pre existing conditions that exacerbate covid more?
21250,It’s pretty dangerous to act like an individual is going to always have a horrible experience with covid if they’re vaccinated
21251,"Don't know, good question."
21252,But not sure if an update would need to go through all the default processes as a brand new vaccine needs to go.
21253,"I'd imagine that it would follow a similar path as the flu one, which is updated every year."
21254,I so hope you’re right!
21255,"At this point, I’m just worried about my children, who are too young to be vaccinated."
21256,That's too bad- it's a reality they need to face.
21257,Their loved ones dying of heart disease only affects the dead.
21258,Dying of the cause of a global pandemic ought to be allowed to change their minds and encourage them to pursue a more safe way of living to protect the rest of the family.

21275,Wait till they get a load of Lambda…
21276,I remember a lot of articles stating that they didn’t follow most of the learnings from that outbreak.
21277,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/01/world/asia/china-coronavirus.html
21278,"&gt;COVID has killed fewer 0-17s in the US (340) than H1N1 did (1,800) or an above-average flu season."
21279,We never had the kind of restrictions we see now during those outbreaks.
21280,"The reason that Covid killed fewer 0-17s in the US than the 2009 H1N1 Swine Flu did is partly because we didn't have the kinds of restrictions we see now, and the fact that Novel Influenza strains that occasionally pop up and become pandemic diseases themselves largely target children and younger adults than the typical strains of seasonal flu."
21281,"Fun fact, that flu season (2009-2010) was on the low end of normal range for total deaths in the US with an estimated 12,500 deaths total."
21282,"The 2018-2019 Flu Season was on the high end of average with 64,000 deaths from the mostly H3N2 dominant strains of influenza."
21283,"I’ve seen other experts discuss this possibility, but the consensus I’ve seen is that this could take years to happen, so let’s not get too excited."
21284,Long Covid is not new.
21285,It's a post viral syndrome.
21286,Read about ME/CFS and the experiences of those who have suffered it in recent decades.
21287,It's the same as long covid.

21293,In what way.
21294,Half of the US is still not vaccinated (as an example) we have upwards of a hundred thousand positive cases popping each day.
21295,There aren't many other countries experiencing this volume of cases currently.
21296,If a variant pops up it will probably be here.

21300,When is Delta Pro release?
21301,Because when there was a uniform standard everyone had to wear a mask.
21302,"When they went to saying Vaccinated people didn’t wear masks anymore, then no one knows if the people without a mask are vaccinated or not."
21303,It gives cover for unvaccinated to be selfish and maskless.

21522,Cycle threshold values were similar among specimens from patients who were fully vaccinated and those who were not.

80% of hospitalized were vaccinated

21572,"Unfortunately even at our high level of uptake, we won't get to herd immunity which is probably more around 90%."
21573,Very low
21574,"Prolly based on population %, so mostly rural counties with metro centers that make up a larger portion of their population."
21575,That’s my guess anyway
21576,The main objective of lockdowns was to flatten the curve so that the healthcare system doesn't get overrun.
21577,However if the virus truly continues evolving around vaccines in perpetuity a better plan than permanent social and economic restriction would be to actually increase the capacity for treatment.
21578,Make permanent dedicated COVID treatment clinics and start graduating more doctors to staff them.
21579,"Change the codes to require better ventilation in buildings, etc."
21580,That won't be cheap but it would have to be less costly than trying to run society in an endless lockdown cycle.
21581,This!!!
21582,I think taking away the things that could cause a huge outbreak (large indoor gatherings) would be a bad variable for delta.
21583,Almost as if they shoulda Fauccied their Florida...
21584,"I mean, how much “world policing” goes on?"
21585,We pretty much have military bases everywhere and send donations to every country.

21590,"Yes, and the long-term effects of Covid are worse too."
21591,There's a really scary line in that article that shows China has learned nothing.
21592,The local officials were punished for the outbreak.
21593,This is likely why covid19 busted out into the country and then the world.
21594,Local officials scared shitless that they'd end up disappointing the wrong communist leader and swept the initial outbreak under the rug and downplayed it.
21595,Said everything was under control and didn't want to make waves.
21596,By the time it got out of hand it was way too late to contain it.
21597,Depends on your definition of 'end'.
21598,Eradication?
21599,Never.
21600,"We were *never* going to eradicate something so virulent, especially since Covid had a year of head start to become entrenched."
21601,"The only 'end' we can reasonably achieve is an ongoing, perhaps annual, booster to tackle new variants, the same way we manage the flu."
21602,"Personally, if we get to that point, I'd consider that a big win."
21603,"It really does, thank you!"
21604,"I’m not particularly worried, but it seems like telling folks I’ve had bleeding issues but nothing else and that folks I know had pregnancies just fine really does ease some concerns."
21605,Yes anon Redditer word is worth more than news articles or what WHO says
21606,Have you tried just walking into a Walgreens and asking for a Covid vaccine?
21607,[removed]
21608,"No it's not, it's steady at around 40k a day, and that's only because of one state which makes up over half the daily cases, since the state did really well in previous waves and thus have less natural immunity."
21609,I’m with you.
21610,I’m also black and have been vaccinated since May.
21611,"My co workers, also black, have been vaccinated since March."
21612,Tuskegee was dead last on our mind when getting vaccinated.

21614,We aren’t sending our middle to preschool.

21616,"Little kids can’t/won’t keep a mask on, wash hands or stop touching their face."
21617,I trust my middle schooler but I have a feeling they will be forced online once an outbreak occurs in the district.
21618,Yes but then the UK decided one dose was ineffective against delta.
21619,So the UK then changed all the schedules.
21620,But you’re right.
21621,Any good news is to be appreciated.
21622,:)
21623,...what?
21624,"You called me cushy, I’m refuting that."
21625,You can’t come in with personal jabs and expect someone not to respond to that.
21626,And it does refute the rest of your comment.
21627,It’s ridiculous to act like not being able to take off work is a valid reason not to be vaccinated when going to the hospital or having a severe case would make someone have to take *far more time off work.

21629,"Jesus, yeah, losing our vaccination records was almost comically frequently."
21630,They still had small outbreaks but they're probably the only one so far without having lost control.

21638,Younger age cohorts started the trial later.
21639,U say that but I actually work in the industry and that's not exactly the consesus
21640,Got the vaccine when I could even though I was pregnant.
21641,Getting covid was probably going to be a lot worse than the vaccine.
21642,I only had a sore arm for a couple of days and that was it.
21643,"I don't regret taking the vaccine, and our baby is happy and healthy."
21644,So may e the first one but those aren't adverse events.
21645,That is a particular word with a proper meaning.
21646,You're describing side effects.
21647,Vastly different.
21648,They are two different different sections of a medications information.
21649,This is what worries me so much about the Texas/Florida/Missouri spike.
21650,They *do* have a seasonal reason for why infections are rising more rapidly there in addition to the other obvious ones.

21664,Now come to find out I got covid right before my second shot.
21665,Is there a recommended or reviewed way to move forward here?
21666,Do I still get the second shot?
21667,And is there a certain amount of time I have to wait?

21671,I haven't paid it much attention this week since I've been super busy but the data experts were all hoping for a Missouri peak this week.
21672,If so it would be a pretty good indication we are following other countries experiencing with Delta.
21673,Glad to hear it appears to be the case at least in Missouri.
21674,Cause of death substituted with “stupidity”.
21675,Honestly.
21676,Fuck all these comments making jokes about it.
21677,Everyone acting like the drummer wasn't taking it out of spite against the band.

21679,I’ve probably seen about a dozen cases of GBS.
21680,Mild with very minor symptoms to paralysis that never reversed and a 20-something year old needing a ventilator for the rest of her life.
21681,That meant going to a nursing home and someone else having to care for her young daughter.
21682,No way I’d get the vaccine if I had a history of GBS.
21683,Maybe in 2-3 years when there’s reports of zero GBS diagnoses from this virus but not until then.
21684,We’ll need to dress in among us suits next
21685,"They don't get paid to think and understand, they get paid to follow orders"
21686,So vaccines trigger GBS but not viruses themselves?
21687,At that rate the guy might as well never leave quarantine.
21688,"Sure it sounds mean, but really, downvote all you want, viruses trigger GBS more often than vaccines."
21689,All loan the forgiveness programs were passed by Congress.
21690,Example being CCRAA passed in 2007.
21691,Congress controls the budget.
21692,Biden could try an executive order but it will challenged and more than likely be found unconstitutional since it will add hundreds of billions of debt.
21693,He needs to put it in the budget and that only needs a majority to pass Congress and not a super majority.
21694,In the same way that only losing 19 pounds instead of the 20 goal is a failure.
21695,Their policies account for cases showing up - and being handled.
21696,They are the good guys.
21697,People with long-term tenants who are part of their circle.
21698,"They have enough money to retire right now, esp if they sell the properties, that have at least doubled in value since they bought them."
21699,"They haven't because they enjoy being handymen, the relationship they have with their tenants, other stuff old people without jobs enjoy."
21700,Imagine dog breeding.
21701,"One person gets into a breed fancy, shows their dogs, has planned pregnancies after genetic testing."
21702,The price of their puppies literally almost covers their retirement hobby.
21703,"Or you could get your new best friend from a puppy farm, where your new pup's mom gives birth every six months and lives in a cage, as did your pup regardless of the fancy pictures."
21704,Morn small good landlords.
21705,One of the consequences of this pandemic.
21706,Also morn millions of Americans who will eventually be homeless.
21707,Sometimes there really isn't a bad guy.
21708,I could use some boosters.
21709,Need to up the amperage on my viral load.
21710,Oh yes lets do Chemtrails
21711,"I'm a bit concerned that a lot of people's vaccine effect will start wearing down around Oct-Nov, right when the holidays start and Delta (and possibly Lambda) variants lurking

21714,Lived on Houston for 30 years.
21715,"Moved to DC and took a job with a lot of driving figuring, heh, I've seen Houston traffic, how bad can it be?"
21716,A year in I decided that DC won for worst driving hands down.
21717,"FFS, if you miss your turn in DC, you basically have to drive to Maryland to turn around."
21718,"What are the chances that they are parting ways with him for other reasons, and he's using this to save face?"
21719,bands drop members all the time.
21720,there are usually hard feelings.
21721,What would it be instead?
21722,A pond?
21723,"I am very much not a cushy fuck, thanks."
21724,"I make so little I live in subsidized housing and my job, at least for now, is dead-end."
21725,I’m still not using that as an excuse to not get vaccinated because of side effects that (spoiler) didn’t happen to me.
21726,My job would have been in jeopardy *had* I gotten sick for weeks or ended up in the hospital.
21727,I know people who were fired because they had to quarantine or went to the hospital.
21728,Right to work states are a thing.
21729,What we’re not gonna do is pull the “actually it’s classist to tell people to get vaccinated” card.
21730,That’s bullshit.
21731,Kind of glad Canada did something like 3 months in between then.
21732,It was to get more people their 1st dose sooner but seems to have lucked out in other ways too.
21733,Missouri's cases seem to be plateauing and starting to drop and the death's are flat as a board.
21734,They only got 41% of their population fully vaccinated.
21735,https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/usa/missouri/
21736,"I agree, but a substantial portion of the population views accepting 'mainstream' medical advice as contrary to their beliefs."
21737,"At the moment, the only ones I'm aware of are pubs/bars/restaurants."
21738,"Most places have been outdoors-only for months, now (I think starting a week ago?)"
21739,they can allow indoors for the vaccinated.
21740,"It's quite contentious because the vaccine rollout has been batched by age-group, oldest first - so the numbers of people vaccinated also skew older."
21741,"However, the numbers of people working in pubs/bars/restaurants skew younger, leaving some people in a situation where they're allowed to serve customers, but they're not allowed to be customers (indoors at least)."
21742,Which is a bit crap.
21743,"Ultimately though, this time last month it was outdoors only."
21744,"So they're exactly where they were, but it's eased up the demand for the limited outdoor seating."
21745,And you'd assume more customers means safer employment.
21746,"So it is win-win, but it really, really doesn't feel like it."
21747,(for the funny side of this - I've had both jabs but my partner is still waiting for her second; so I'm allowed in the pub but she isn't.
21748,It's been 20 years since I could last say that!)

21750,There are a variety of vaccines.
21751,"Some are using the “new shit” of newly developed mRNA technology, but others (like the J&amp;J) are using the same “old shit” we’ve been using to make vaccines for decades."
21752,Is the J&amp;J not old enough or do you also refuse the standard set of vaccines that were required for you to go to things like public school (and probably most universities)?
21753,They are less likely to get it in the first place.
21754,Hi!
21755,I have a two year old so this is something I've looked into.
21756,The information I found is peer reviewed and study-based.
21757,"Basically, there's a pretty solid study that was posted a couple weeks back that indicated only 2-4% of kids experience long-covid, and due to some selective bias in terms of the way that the study was done it's probably significantly lower."
21758,"Even in cases where ""long covid"" may be present, the most common issue was fatigue."
21759,"Studies like this are difficult because they are asking parents about whether they're kids are experiencing these conditions, which at times could be anxiety-driven."
21760,It's likely that your child is going to be fine.
21761,"I mean they have a track record of killing innocents 🤷‍♂️
I'm not surprised"
21762,Hopefully not.
21763,Good.
21764,This is our ticket out of this.
21765,&gt; Not 50% of the population have vaccine reactions.
21766,I think it meant half the population having a shockingly different reaction to the vaccine being available (namely the whole.... 'not getting it' thing).
21767,Not to the vaccine injection itself.
21768,"I think the last winter wave was driven by the holidays (Thanksgiving, then Christmas and New Years), when people were gathering

I feel like there's a large group of people who agreed with the idea of masking up, socially distancing, but weren't gonna sacrifice their holidays for that."
21769,"But once the holidays were over, they went back to being safe (and because cases &amp; deaths by early Jan were insanely high)."
21770,"That caused the ""winter wave"" to burn out as fewer people gathered after the holidays"
21771,So why go into politics in the first place?
21772,you had me in the first half lol
21773,What scientists?
21774,Every reputable scientist and physician says this.
21775,Last week over 50 medical and other health professions organizations called for mandatory vaccination for healthcare workers.
21776,"You can probably count on one hand those who disagree, for publicity -seeking reasons or are monitoring their anti-vax stance or whatever, but &gt;99% of all virologists, immunologists, infections disease physicians would say to get vaccinated now."
21777,But that’s the problem.
21778,Your political affiliation should not define who you are this way.
21779,It’s not healthy for you as a person or for us as a society.
21780,I was sanitizing my cards with Lysol (long story) and forgot it was in there...
21781,"I know people in multiple jobs, hourly wage positions that can't miss a day if they get vaccinated but if they test positive can get it off, lose pay, but not their job."
21782,It is a hard choice for those in the situatin and as he stated it comes down to the individuals.
21783,Everyone is different.
21784,You are probably a cushy fuck.
21785,The subject matter is so incredibly uncanny.
21786,"He could have gotten his PhD in so many other things in the same field, but it had to be one involving viruses and mRNA."
21787,I have a friend that went through it and he said it was horrible--nearly everyone has some sort of negative reaction.
21788,"I don't agree with that extent of it, but if the military will push that stuff, it will certainly push the COVID shots."
21789,[removed]
21790,"Idk, maybe it really was a medical issue and the lead singer was a dick about it But given his scientific background I'd imagine he's aware that there are people out there who cannot get the vaccine and if it really was a legit serious medical problem he probably be understanding of it."
21791,The tone of the last paragraphs combined with that make me think there was probably a lot more drama going on behind the scenes than what this dude was letting onto in his post.
21792,r
21793,"In states where governors have banned mask mandates, it’s really going to come down to a handful of individuals saying “no, we need this” and betting on the federal government protecting them from retribution."
21794,"Much like with voting rights, so much of this would be fixed if the fed would stop acting so cowardly."
21795,"Sorry, I didn’t mean literally zero Delta."
21796,"But it was a tiny sample size and it wasn’t during a time where Delta was the dominant variant (unlike Israel and Singapore data, which showed lower efficacy)."
21797,The study’s authors literally admitted in interviews that the study cannot be used to judge Delta efficacy.
21798,We have FDA approval in place for a reason

21828,FDA is too busy debating nonsense.
21829,Any scientist worth their salt has been saying that for the whole year.
21830,All due to vax rates that aren't high enough.
21831,"If everyone who was eligible for vaccination got vaccinated, this wouldn't be an issue."
21832,Do you realistically see yourself getting a booster twice a year?
21833,"Not so much resistant as the higher viral load in the nose and upper airway overwhelms the amount of antibodies, which isn't high to begin with in those tissues."
21834,T-cell immunity works just fine against the delta and other variants so that is why the disease rarely progresses into the lungs.
21835,That's a slower process and T-cell immunity kicks in by then.
21836,If booster maintains much higher antibody level the number of infections would likely fall after booster.

To your bigger point."
21864,"I personally think the healthcare expected odds\*cost for a breakthrough infection (and anyone I subsequently pass covid onto) is significantly higher than the expected odds\*cost of getting a third, even unofficially"
21865,&gt;when will it end?
21866,That's anyone's guess.
21867,My guess is that it will become endemic.
21868,Those who are vaccinated will be mostly protected.
21869,Those who refuse or aren't able to obtain or tolerate a vaccine or on whom the vaccine is ineffective will have a more difficult time and worse outcomes on the whole.

21877,People travel.
21878,"If 70 people get infected, what's the chance that none of them leaves town?"
21879,"The reason why these outbreaks stop is that there is repeated blanket screening of entire cities, which leads to the vast majority of infected people being picked up, often before they even become infectious."
21880,"Every infected person is quarantined, as are all of their recent close contacts (since every person in China uses one contract-tracing app, this is much easier)."
21881,These methods are extremely effective.
21882,"After a few rounds of this, every person who has been near an infected person is in quarantine, and most of the new cases are already in quarantine before they're detected."
21883,They never even get a chance to spread the virus.
21884,It already has.
21885,"While case counts are similar to where they were last summer, deaths are dramatically lower (in the US anyways)."
21886,"We were getting around 1500 deaths per day at this time last year, and the last time we were at that number was March of this year."
21887,Viruses do become less deadly over time.
21888,Not to say that we shouldn’t take Delta seriously.
21889,But significantly fewer deaths is a win.
21890,"\*with absolutely NO PPE, either!"
21891,That’s J&amp;J. Pfizer is 2 shots currently in the U.S.
21892,Yes lets compare the UK with Florida because their vaccine uptake are definitely similar.
21893,I don’t quite understand why Delta not being dominant would change study results as long as the sample size is large enough.
21894,Please get vaccinated.
21895,"Yep, I live in Washington state, but in a red town."
21896,mask wearing was at about 5% when we hit the 70% vaccination mark.
21897,Obviously doesn’t add up.
21898,"Yes, like any viral infection there is a risk of longer symptoms."
21899,"But according to a study by King's COllege London,

https://www.kcl.ac.uk/news/long-covid-uncommon-in-children

""Fewer than one in 20 children with symptomatic COVID-19 experienced symptoms lasting longer than 4 weeks, and almost all children have fully recovered by 8 weeks, a new study has found."""
21900,"Most long covid symptoms are milder symptoms, slight fatigue, cough etc."
21901,Even moderate symptoms will mostly clear up.
21902,"There is always a risk, like with any viral infection, of a long term disability, in the same way there are lots of risks in life."

21943,I don't want to have to wear them as much as the next guy but I don't know if I can ever go into another grocery store again without a mask and sanitizing my groceries.
21944,Maybe it's overkill but I'd rather be safe than sorry and it's really a minor inconvenience.
21945,I think it'd be wise for us to adopt wearing masks in crowds from now on during flu seasons.
21946,I'd like to nuance this a bit: science never prescribes policy.
21947,"There's always a judgement call, and weighing the benefits with the negatives, and this isn't scientific in itself."
21948,Science can only provide supporting knowledge.
21949,The roundabout numbers I've seen is that Alpha was 50% more transmissable than the original wild trpe strain and that Delta is 50-60% more transmissiable than Alpha.
21950,"Herd immunity only means, and has only ever meant, one thing and it's very easy to measure."

21966,"It’s plateauing, though."

21981,The eerie silence from the White House is.
21982,"A month ago Biden said we were breaking up with the Virus like it blocked him on Facebook or something, then two weeks ago in a live town hall he spread misinformation about Delta and just doubled down on vaccines will save us."
21983,"And now a week of articles where people like Osterholm are being quoted because the best anyone can get from WH is ""an official who did not want to be named"" talking about how nobody knows what the plan is."

21990,"He's out there talking to his people about the third shot, he's setting metrics for when they have to shut down if they exceed them nationally, he got the nation to put a mask back on after their numbers went back up."
21991,We need this because Americans are NOT aware that the situation is really bad.
21992,So we need messaging from the top saying it's really bad.
21993,Where is it?
21994,It’s criminally negligent.
21995,Public inquiry and prosecution for every political leader responsible for excess covid deaths.
21996,Well it's a good thing tokyo doesn't have some huge multi country event going on with their hospitals not able to care for a covid patient
21997,"If California can recall good governors, why the f\*ck can't Florida recall inept ones?"

21999,"Not really, it's not an on-off switch."
22000,"It will get better at evading immunity, but not completely, so it's a setback, but not going all the way to square one."
22001,There's no guarantee that will happen though.
22002,The current vaccines are effective against the variants.
22003,"There is simply no point in fretting about the next variant now, any more than fretting about the next novel virus."
22004,"It might happen, it might not."
22005,So get tested for a highly contagious disease right in the area where the public go shopping or at a clinic where patients are seeing a dr for non contagious disease?

22012,"However, IMO, the US media has not done a good enough job sowing fear this entire pandemic given the prevalent vaccine hesitancy."
22013,People should be **terrified** of getting COVID19 or transmitting it to those at risk; terrified enough to take the extremely small risk of getting side effects from a very safe and lifesaving vaccine.

22229,This is primarily used to identify potential topics to further investigate with regards to vaccine reactions.
22230,"However, because the event data in VAERS is often not verified and is often self-reported, it should not be assumed that the adverse events in VAERS are actually associated with or cause by the vaccines, nor is it possible to estimate the frequency of these adverse events from these data."

22238,"From a [FDA News Release](https://www.fda.gov/news-events/press-announcements/coronavirus-covid-19-update-july-13-2021) July 13:

&gt; Today, the FDA is announcing revisions to the vaccine recipient and vaccination provider fact sheets for the Johnson &amp; Johnson (Janssen) COVID-19 Vaccine to include information pertaining to an observed increased risk of Guillain-Barré Syndrome (GBS) following vaccination."
22239,"GBS is a neurological disorder in which the body’s immune system damages nerve cells, causing muscle weakness, or in the most severe cases, paralysis."
22240,"Based on an analysis of Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting (VAERS) data, there have been 100 preliminary reports of GBS following vaccination with the Janssen vaccine after approximately 12.5 million doses administered."
22241,"Of these reports, 95 of them were serious and required hospitalization."
22242,There was one reported death.
22243,"Each year in the United States, an estimated 3,000 to 6,000 people develop GBS."
22244,Most people fully recover from the disorder.
22245,"GBS has also been observed at an increased rate associated with certain vaccines, including certain seasonal influenza vaccines and a vaccine to prevent shingles."
22246,"Although the available evidence suggests an association between the Janssen vaccine and increased risk of GBS, it is insufficient to establish a causal relationship."
22247,No similar signal has been identified with the Moderna and Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccines.
22248,"FDA continues to work with its partner in vaccine safety surveillance, the CDC, to monitor reports of GBS following vaccination with the Janssen COVID-19 Vaccine."
22249,"Importantly, the FDA has evaluated the available information for the Janssen COVID-19 Vaccine and continues to find the known and potential benefits clearly outweigh the known and potential risks."

22264,Most people are understanding of people who have health issues.
22265,That's why most of us continue to social distance and wear masks despite being vaccinated

“DeSantis credited his response to COVID, which has focused on vaccinating seniors and nursing home residents, for the fact that fewer Floridians are dying now than last August."
22307,"A year ago, Florida was averaging about 180 COVID deaths per day during an early August spike, but last week averaged about 55 per day.”"

22319,I honestly think that would be a hard choice.
22320,Parents of students with compromised immune systems being forced to choose between their job with insurance or staying home with their kid rather than sending them to school?

22334,Florida in particular has been pretty uh... special.
22335,There are *zero* restrictions.
22336,There are even laws preventing restrictions like mask wearing.
22337,Some hospitals are so over burdened that they can no longer accept patients now.

22343,How long should I wait?
22344,I don't think it matters.
22345,It's no longer about arguing with anti-vaxxers.

22365,&gt;Fully approving a vaccine and then authorizing a booster for it soon after might also offer conflicting messages about its effectiveness.
22366,I'm so pissed at this.
22367,Basically they are denying me my booster shot because they are trying to convince the anti-vax people.
22368,"Like dude, no."
22369,"Just let people who want boosters to get the boosters, and if anti-vaxx people don't want it stop trying to convince them."

22447,"After Sturgis last year, before vaccines, I had this nightmare thought of  your ""coworker"" coming in bright and early Monday morning after their week at Sturgis, a coworker who  works next to you and around you, who is bragging about  what a great time they had at Sturgis, in all the bars and indoor concerts, and how they didnt wear a mask......."

22469,Studies done in lab do not always resemble what occurs in the real world.
22470,Studies also indicate a much greater immune response from natural infection to a wider range of variants.
22471,The vaccines do a great job of eliciting Abs against the spike protein however natural infection produces more far ranging immunity to many different proteins in the virus.
22472,Real world data has shown that reinfections are more rare than breakthrough infections.
22473,One such example is the cleveland study which showed no reinfections over a certain period while a small number breakthrough infections did occur.
22474,I also remember reading real world data about India and how reinfections were rare and in Israel reinfections happened much less often than breakthrough infections.
22475,In the UK the number of reinfections have been very low however they do have a much greater amount of breakthrough infections.
22476,It is rare for a vaccine to generate better immunity than natural infection in almost all pathogens we encounter.
22477,Going to go out on a limb here and say our medical system will not collapse in the US.

22518,spiral out
22519,I’m a published scientist who has directly studied (and published on) covid infection and also the impacts of vaccine on autoimmune diseases.
22520,Vaccines are our best chance to beat covid.
22521,"If you are able to be vaccinated, you should get vaccinated."
22522,"But vaccines CAN, in certain circumstances, cause autoimmune disease."
22523,"If you have a history of autoimmune disease, like GBS, inflammation (which is required for effective vaccination) can exacerbate autoimmune disease."
22524,Not everyone can get vaccinated.
22525,Not everyone who gets vaccinated develops protective immunity.
22526,That’s the whole point of herd immunity.
22527,It’s really shitty to discriminate against people who cannot get vaccinated FOR MEDICAL REASONS.
22528,"Many people who are infected with covid do not develop proper immune responses, so in general if you have been infected it is important to still get vaccinated."
22529,But a simple antibody test would show if he has titters that are comparable to those of someone who is vaccinated.
22530,No reason they couldn’t do this.
22531,"But even if they did it and he didn’t have good titers, let me ask you this: if someone was vaccinated and for whatever reason their body was unable to generate an adaptive immune response, would you fire them?"
22532,Because many people who do get vaccine can’t develop a response.
22533,"Again, whole point of herd immunity."
22534,"TLDR: vaccines are best bet, get them if you can, don’t discriminate against people who cannot get them for medical reasons, fuck The Offspring they are not the band I thought they were"
22535,But this guy isn’t being treated with any of those meds.
22536,Also when you are sick it feels a little more like an emergency than when you are just minding your own business and trying to stay safe.
22537,"I am irritated by saying they are focusing on vaccinations, and can't be bothered with any mask guidance."
22538,As if you can't do both
22539,"Because we try the honor system and it obviously didn't work....

Time change."
22540,Pandemic at this large scale that shut down pretty much the whole world never happen in modern day history before.
22541,So yeah.
22542,I'm tired.
22543,Everyone is tired.
22544,"Wether it is ok or not...oh well.... but most of us know Vaccination is pretty much the only way out from this pandemic, or at least turn it into common cold."
22545,"https://www.washingtonpost.com/context/cdc-breakthrough-infections/11fc6a11-20d7-466e-a654-c6bc8426f688/

They have stats as low as 64%, though other countries mark it on the low end as 79%."
22546,For modeling purposes (slide 21) the CDC chose 75-80%.
22547,My personal opinion is just the 1.
22548,Right?
22549,I’m surprised this wasn’t mandatory from day 1.

22556,That's the same vibe I got from it.
22557,"It started off sound, then started wandering off-piste."
22558,"Ultimately if it'll affect their access to studios, venues, and travel, it's a sound business decision."
22559,Children.
22560,They aren’t eligible for the vaccine and have little choice.
22561,people with immune issues- like transplant recipients.
22562,"some get the vaccine, but don’t have an immune response."
22563,"I overall agree, because I’ve spent the past year dealing with customers who are idiots and assholes- but I try to think of those who have less choice."
22564,"I do get how frustrating it is- and sometimes I think ‘well, one less vote for Gov DeathSentence’- but, I know a lot of people who have been really isolated for a year and just want to see other people, or kids who want to play with their friends- and it’s hard to judge them too harshly."
22565,This is one of thos turning points in society- and I’m not perfec.
22566,"I was so damn happy to take my mask off, and so pissed about putting it back on- but… there are those that have little choice, and even if they wear a mask, a) they become ‘outsiders’ and b) it’s not complete protection- and then there are the kids."
22567,so- shrug- we all just need to accept that this isn’t over and work on our patience and kindness (me included).
22568,"I wear my mask in public to help those at risk who are also wearing a mask- for those who don’t protect themselve, they will continue to put themselves in at risk situations- but I won’t have to feel any guilt or responsibility."
22569,"I can go home and hug my dad (who is in heart failure, but vaccinated) and not feel like an asshole."
22570,They diidn't contact trace those who attended last year.
22571,.
22572,Those numbers were made up because most of everyone who attended left Sturgis and went back to their own communities all over America and brought covid with them.
22573,"It will be the same this year, except with the Delta variant a lot less safe."
22574,&gt; Covid was certainly there and anybody who went unvaccinated was in some serious risk.
22575,"Honestly, fuck ‘em."
22576,The vaccine is proving incredibly effective.
22577,I have near-zero sympathy for anyone who is vaccine eligible and hasn’t gotten it.

22590,"It seems like he's ""trying to have his cake and eat it too,"" if that makes sense."
22591,That’s not really how the math works
22592,I got my vaccine from CVS and they put the store number on it both times
22593,"&gt; I am trying to figure out why paying money is preferable to getting the shot for them, and all I can come up with is avoiding the side effects."
22594,"I'm pro-vax, but in the way of an explanation:

It's about identity."
22595,Not vaxing is a statement of your political beliefs.
22596,Having that taken away is a big deal.
22597,Subverting the system is a way of doubling down on your identity.
22598,Falsifying a vax record would be a pretty open-and-shut Honor Code violation and should result in expulsion.

22602,"The country which New York resides in, which is what we’re talking about per the article in this post, has already opened up to many below 18 (12 and up currently) and will be opening up to 6 months-11 likely in the coming months."
22603,"The other countries you speak of have often held out on 18 and below because of supply issues, the U.S. doesn’t have supply issues, and we also don’t rely on any of these “other” countries to determine our guidelines or regulations anyways."
22604,Gotta keep em vaccinated!
22605,What is the FDA waiting for tho?
22606,Yeah.
22607,People have a zero risk tolerance mindset.
22608,&gt; Apparently the J&amp;J vaccine has about 100 cases out of 12.5 million doses administered (source).
22609,"It’s a ridiculously low incidence, but he’s a person at some increased baseline risk."
22610,"Honestly, I don't blame him for deferring on the J&amp;J shot, even if his chances of seeing some GBS complications are incredibly rare."
22611,"But, as far as I can tell, we haven't seen any evidence of GBS resulting from the mRNA vaccines (Moderna/Pfizer)."

22626,"They can hire another drummer, he's not a founding member, he is missing out on a gig, just like any number of people are missing out on good work because of covid."
22627,Got hit by a paywall.
22628,Does the article mention what percentage of kids have long-term symptoms?
22629,I believe the odds of escape mutations occuring should actually decrease as active infections decline.
22630,"That said, I do believe the variants we choose to track/name in the future will be less potent due to necessarily high similarity w OG strain."

22645,They were created by Congress because normally FDA approval usually takes several to many years and a lot more paperwork ..
22646,The widespread successful uses under the EUA will no doubt be cited as evidence that the vaccines are safe enough &amp; effective enough to get FDA approval.

23027,Bonnaroo is worth it.
23028,This sub was (is) in HUGE denial about the Israeli data.
23029,Surprise… more and more studies are confirming the Israelis had it right.
23030,"Breakthrough infections are going to be the norm rather than the exception… people don’t want to hear this, but it’s true."
23031,&gt;	t’s a shame the same can’t be said about the vaccine.
23032,Then you’re claiming that the vaccines cause long term problems for more than 2% of children.
23033,That’s a lie.
23034,That’s a straight-up baldfaced lie.

23038,"Again though, you're focusing on the less important number...

&gt;It did, however, show that the vaccine remains 91% effective against developing serious cases of the disease and 88% effective against hospitalization."
23039,"If we need boosters, we need boosters, but there's no need for doom &amp; gloom about vaccines right now."
23040,They're doing an amazing job.
23041,Would love if a reporter asked him if his family got a covid test while in Mexico and if it's possible that American families like his may have brought back a variant with them.
23042,"I don't think war metaphors are particularly helpful here, but I'll indulge this one."
23043,Generally (no pun intended) the object of waging a war is to destroy the enemy's means of doing you harm.
23044,"It is not necessary to annihilate him to do this, merely to destroy his resources and break his morale."
23045,"After the Second World War, the allies broke Germany's ability to fight by partitioning the country and ensuring they would not have the ability to fight again."
23046,"Similarly with Covid, at least in heavily-vaccinated Western countries, we have succeeded in destroying Covid's ability to make us sick and kill us in massive numbers."
23047,This is enough and all we're going to get.
23048,Don't fall for the scam that we have to eradicate covid.
23049,We are throwing away thousands of doses in the US because people refuse to get vaccinated.
23050,Why would we put a stop on booters?
23051,hope this is true because if this isn't true we are fucked
23052,I just talked with my pediatrician about this.
23053,"Unless they have a condition that predisposes them to severe outcomes, the usual illnesses that hit kids in school and daycare are worse for them."
23054,There's very little chance anything will happen to them.
23055,"Obviously you need to tailor that advice to your situation, but that's the medical advice I got around taking my kid to the park, swim class, etc."
23056,Good luck!
23057,Yes.
23058,I hate them too.
23059,Work as in reduces hospitalizations and deaths.
23060,Problem is there is a fraction of breakout cases that lead to hospitalization and death yet unvaxxed are much much higher.
23061,"Yes, things are evolving, but most of the problems are stemming from the societal issues like vax hesitation, not the shot itself."

23068,No its people that the us government historically and to this day weaponized the medical industry against.
23069,We created the mistrust and we still haven't done the bare minimum to repair that relationship.
23070,"Also, the Spanish flu hit the healthy much harder than the vulnerable because (if I'm remembering correctly) it was aaaaall about the cytokine storms."

23073,"Such brave, rugged individuals valuing liberty over safety."
23074,We could all learn a lot if we ignored doctors and took more advice from junior high schoolers.
23075,I remember being hopeful that we could maintain 250k new doses a day for August but it seems like double that number is not out of the question.
23076,I actually wouldn’t be surprised if it was over 500k average fingers crossed 🤞🏼
23077,News that is shocking to absolutely no one
23078,Yeah it’s very strange.
23079,Idk if it’s a Reddit thing or what but there’s a major tendency to see everything as hopeless.
23080,How long will it take human societies to get their sh×t together and vaccinate everyone?
23081,5 years?
23082,"Just a preview of how we'll handle climate change, new pandemics, antibiotic-resistant bugs, Etc."
23083,"Well, he is technically correct, maybe."
23084,"New hospital admissions were (according to CDC data):

7/30: 1842  
7/31: 1768  
8/1: 1668

Of course this is all recent data so should be treated as provisional because of potential reporting delays."
23085,DeSantis can suck shit but the available data does indicate that *maybe* daily hospitalizations peaked on 7/30.
23086,I hope it is true.
23087,GOP there is terrified of the real C19 numbers.
23088,"Man, looking at the previous UK surge vs the latest one:

Last surge: ~60k cases a day

Deaths: 1,242 a day

Latest surge: 47k cases a day

deaths: 83 a day

that's 75% of the cases, but not even 10% of the death rate."
23089,That's a pretty good indication of how well the vaccines work.
23090,"Using expiring doses for boosters is fine, but I think the WHO wants to avoid wealthy countries ordering hundreds of millions of new doses to use as immediate boosters while the rest of the world still waits for dose one."

23103,Delusional people who think they are the center of the universe.
23104,[removed]
23105,The biggest problem among that is communication.
23106,We focus SO MUCH on every minor risk of COVID that people forget how much risk they accept in their daily lives.
23107,"I have no science to back this up, but my guess would be the flu, driving a car, getting on a bus, and a whole host of other things are more risky to a vaccinated person than COVID, but those are all a regular part of our lives so we don’t think about them."
23108,We really need to encourage vaccinated people to just start viewing COVID as another minor disease they catch here snd there like any other cold.
23109,"These cases of long COVID and hospitalizations along the vaccinated are so rare that the media hyping them up is only leading to this kind of insane though process of “well I’ve waited a year and a half foe this vaccine, but it’s still not good enough even when outside with everyone vaccinated.” That’s fucking ridiculous, and is only happening because the messaging around this is so piss poor"
23110,"If everyone else is vaccinated they are statistically \*remarkably\* safe, and Holland \*knows\* this - because understanding statistical data is a big part of his PhD in microbiology."
23111,"He gets very little extra safety for ANYONE in his established business, and only enforces his will on one of the employees of his business for *no real purpose other than asserting his will."
23112,"*

The only people who are at potentially significant increased risk are the drummer and other people that made the personal decision not to be vaccinated."
23113,It isn't Holland's job to force those people to take the precautions he believes are necessary.
23114,"His job is to sit up there, play guitar, and entertain an audience."
23115,"If you truly believe the sentiment in your comment, I feel even worse for you."
23116,With finite doses of the vaccine it does.
23117,At least within the timeframe of ending this pandemic as soon as possible.
23118,Those booster doses that might be increasing efficacy by 10-20% or so could instead be used as initial doses in places without them increasing global immunity far more per dose.
23119,Well well what a surprise.
23120,ppffftt.
23121,Unless you live in an area where hospitals are overwhelmed and turning away patients.
23122,Vaccines aren’t just about protecting yourself.
23123,Lmaoooo I mean the risk is probably small... but I just remembered an article about a long lost virus or pathogen recently being discovered in frozen ice.
23124,Sigh.

23128,Minimal risk.
23129,Same as any respiratory infection.

23131,Most of the anti-vaxxers are anti-universal healthcare too....
23132,Lambda is not even close to the transmissibility of delta.
23133,We probably had lambda cases in the country but delta took over it
23134,A mask is not part of their body.
23135,What a lame argument on their part.
23136,Either the vaccine works to protect us or it doesn't.
23137,We can't all hide in a hole for the next decade once we're fully vaccinated.
23138,Obama did everything he could've right.

23140,The people responding to you saying “we only ever cared about the hospitalization data on here” is such BS.
23141,"The data this sub was ecstatic about back in November of last year was protection against infection, not hospitalization."
23142,"If people had been told in November the vaccine was only 50% effective against infection (rather than 95%), we all would have been dismayed."
23143,"The drop in protection against infection has very serious implications for herd immunity, and also has a negative impact on our ability to drop public health measures."
23144,Claiming that we should ONLY care about its ability to starve off hospitalization is short-sighted.

23154,"Yes, and that's what masking in public is for."
23155,The reason I'm irritated is because you get people attacking the efficacy of the vaccines without data.
23156,I've seen a lot of baseless claims that the vaccine does not curb transmission.

But on the other, fuck that, give me the booster so I can be safe"
23164,Thanks Captain Obvious!
23165,"It's an absolute must that we actually prove that vaccines are safe and they actually work efficiently on children, and this is even more important now thanks to Delta."
23166,"I personally feel masks are needed in public spaces like airports, hospitals, schools, and large gatherings like festivals and concerts and so on."
23167,"The CDC's pivot based on the P-town study is pretty bogus, I agree."
23168,"Masking should always be for the benefit of the unvaccinated, nothing else."
23169,Lol I'm glad I don't work in a profit motivated sector.
23170,Putting profit over lives is big brain time.
23171,Miss me with that please.
23172,But hey you work for the private sector!
23173,All that matters is profits.
23174,"Who cares about quality of life, happiness, advancement of the human race?"
23175,I’m this person with a mask on alone in my car.
23176,And the reason is 99% laziness and forgetfulness.
23177,"I’m too lazy to be taking it on and off and if I do take it off, I’m likely to forget it, have to go back to my car and grab my mask, etc."
23178,That other 1% is so I can go hard on singing in my car to music without people seeing my weird ass expressions.
23179,Duh?
23180,"There is a large population of the US that cannot yet be vaccinated, children under 12."
23181,With Delta we need to get almost 85% of the total population vaccinated for herd immunity to be effective.
23182,Wrong way around - I don't claim to be smart but I am a medical professional who is thoroughly fed up with antivaxx nonsense.
23183,"To be fair to Pete, I don't think he came up with all this himself as some kind of ruse."
23184,I think he genuinely believed it for the same reason other people here are believing it is plausible.
23185,"But someone somewhere has thought about how to disguise a dangerous message in reasonable sounding framework, that he now seems to be perpetuating in good faith."
23186,That's how vaccine mistrust spreads.
23187,I honesty worry about the amount of blind trust that is placed in someone's assertion that their doctor told them not to vaccinate.

23206,Are vaccines in the US…what’s the right word…fungible?

23231,this is a huge question for a lot of people and it's sad to see it downvoted..
23232,"I got vaccinated a few weeks ago, but I'm still wary of potentially getting and spreading the virus asymptomatically, because everything I've read regarding sterile immunity has basically amounted to ""we aren't certain about anything yet""."
23233,Taking a chance on shit like this could be taking a chance on accidentally killing a relative for a lot of people..
23234,I will gladly keep masking up and social distancing until there's more data (though I have to admit I enjoy having my face covered in public and having an excuse to not interact with people 💩)
23235,Actually it will probably be even less people that will take a booster shot.
23236,"There will be those who had bad side effects that will avoid the booster, those who just took it initially to get into college, travel etc"
23237,The media doesn't help by throwing out blanket statements and big scary numbers.
23238,That's very reasonable.
23239,What are you doing here?
23240,"Well if they do check, didnt stop me or other people I know."
23241,Idiots with too much time on their hands whine about wearing a mask based on huge leaps of logic and hypocritical reasoning.
23242,No need to read the article.
23243,"In before ""but they purposefully rushed the approval and we can't trust it!"""
23244,Would second generation be a mutation of a variant?
23245,Like Delta’s child?
23246,"Well thanks for the vote of confidence, I was starting to think I was taking crazy pills or something."
23247,It would be absolutely foolish to throw out doses that could be used as boosters if they can't be used elsewhere.
23248,"Unfortunately, the US has handled many things foolishly."
23249,Approved for the under 12 kids?
23250,"I’m sure they would like nothing more than to have that done, but they have to finish gathering &amp; analyzing the data, just as they did for adult &amp; teen age groups."
23251,"They can’t cut any corners, even if we’d all like them too."
23252,I’m also desperate to see this approved &amp; am anxious bc I read headlines 1-2 weeks ago that FDA may be asking Pfizer to include even more children in the latest pediatric trial.
23253,"That would mean an even linger delay 😫😭

That’s just how this all goes though."
23254,"You can’t skip over important steps, you just can’t."
23255,And there’s already at least one more variant spreading around to follow behind delta

23276,"I respond by pointing out that the lack of FDA approval was thus never actually part of their objection in the first place and bringing it up was a disingenuous derail, not a good faith argument."
23277,if they have mass testing sites wont those spread the infection as everyone goes to get tested?
23278,considering how contagious this version is.
23279,im not sure how much time in a zone is to much even with mask+distancing.
23280,non delta seemed like you had to spend an hour + in a room with someone unprotected.
23281,but at 1000 times the load seems like even several minutes could be hazardous to nonvaccinated
23282,My MIL did the same.
23283,She works at a school and got fired after she caught covid and spread it in the building.

23299,"Look, I wear masks and have followed all of the advice on quarantines from the start."
23300,And I will keep following the rules because I’m lawful good.
23301,But even I wonder where this all will end.
23302,"COVID is already endemic and because it mutates quickly, it’s going to be with us for years to come."
23303,"Some years our vaccines and booster shots will be more effective, but other times they won’t be."
23304,"Statistically, this virus hasn’t been as deadly for children and is on par with flu."
23305,I understand that every death is tragic.
23306,And I also acknowledge that we don’t actually ever put into practice policies that would stop most preventable deaths.
23307,"(If we did, we’d lower speed limits to 35mph."
23308,That would certainly stop preventable death at the cost of a minor inconvenience while traveling.
23309,"Everyone knows someone who has died in a car accident, and most of those deaths occurred at speeds higher than 35mph.)"
23310,The standard can’t be “we will end the restrictions when we eradicate covid.” We’ve only intentionally eradicated one disease in human history: smallpox.
23311,This is more transmissible and mutates faster.
23312,And it can’t be “we will end the restrictions when there’s no more preventable death” because covid will always be with us.
23313,"So the standard has to be something like “we will end the restrictions when the death rate nears the flu’s death rate for adults and children.”  

That’s sucky because there will still be some death."
23314,But I think people are frustrated/skeptical because nobody in government has been clear about the end here.
23315,Its a tragic reality of life.
23316,"In reality, your child is twice as likely to die in a car accident this year of covid."
23317,or strep throat.
23318,or pneumonia.
23319,or influenza.
23320,or bacterial meningitis.
23321,the reality is simple.
23322,"the world is fucked up, and many young lives get cut short."
23323,Exactly.
23324,Eventually every country will have to ask themselves how many daily deaths are they willing to accept to go back to normal.
23325,The UK government already answered.
23326,How does the virus behave any differently in China?
23327,&gt; It somehow appears to be far less contagious.
23328,What are you basing this on?
23329,"In both the Guangzhou and Nanjing outbreaks, hundreds of people were infected within a few weeks of the initial cases."

23334,That's true.
23335,"It's why in each new outbreak in China, the first detected infection has only been the tip of the iceberg."

23353,"There are inherent problems with having a significant portion of your population sick with covid, even if they are likely to survive - your hospitalizations are going to go up, and the overall population level 'viral load' is going to be higher."

&gt;If it looks like half the population is having a shockingly different reaction to these jabs than was expected — it’s probably because their life experiences have actually been shockingly different, and their reasons range from a conscientious risk/benefit analysis, to the financial inability to take time off work/lack of health care in the event of potential side-effects, to an understandable distrust in a system that has never prioritized the health or well-being of their communities."

23650,A lot of these people are the most vulnerable to the seasonal flu.
23651,Tens of millions of people are going to refuse to get the seasonal vaccine out of principal.

23779,Are you a virologist?
23780,&gt; Studies have shown that vaccination leads to what is probably a better immune response (both antibodies and T cells) than infection.

23795,"&gt;For example, late last year Jeffrey Tucker showed that the World Health Organization (WHO) suddenly, and “for reasons unknown,” changed its definition of “herd immunity.” Using screenshots from a cached version on the Internet Archive, Tucker showed how the WHO altered its definition in such a way as to erase completely the role of natural immunity."
23796,"Before, the WHO rightly said it “happens when a population is immune either through vaccination or immunity developed through previous infection.” The WHO’s change stated that it happens “if a threshold of vaccination is reached.” Not long after Tucker’s piece appeared, the WHO restored natural immunity to its definition."

23915,Asking the real questions.
23916,Me too!
23917,The leaked CDC documents said as much.
23918,There are a ton of businesses waiting to drop the requirement hammer the second vaccines are FDA approved.
23919,I've spoken to multiple business owners who share this sentiment.
23920,This is a bigger deal than most people are making it out to be.

23923,"And for you moron downvoters, I literally follow this religiously with 2 kids."
23924,And they mask.
23925,And we completely limit all unnecessary indoor activities.
23926,That doesn't change the data.
23927,"The obvious answer is that when things get bad, enough people change behaviors (masks, distancing, etc) to get the transmissible rate under 1."
23928,There is quite a difference.
23929,Lolla required proof of vaccination or a recent negative test.
23930,Desantis wanted to require NOT asking for proof of vaccination.
23931,"Hetero mix vaccines from studies so far out of several countries seem to support mixing vaccines, especially mRNA and viral vector elicits highest antibody response ."

23933,Ok so this isn’t the route we should go down at all
23934,I was there all four days.
23935,I saw multiple people turned away at the gate every day I went in at the medical checkpoint.
23936,I also saw some shenanigans with people sharing vaccination cards.
23937,It really was all over the place.
23938,Funny how it never spreads during protest though 🤔
23939,"Oops, meant for a different Reddit thread"
23940,That's helpful 😊
23941,if you have an iPhone you can easily get a digital version.
23942,probably works on android too
23943,&gt;	Why isn't America acting like what's happening is happening?
23944,"Because in parts of the country that aren’t run and populated by *complete* fuckwads, we’re doing pretty ok right now."
23945,I live in an area where over 80% of adults (and almost 100% of the elderly) are vaccinated.
23946,A surge like what’s happening in the south is all but impossible here.
23947,Excuse me while I enjoy my life for the first time in a year and a half.
23948,"Well, one way of tackling vaccine hesitancy is banning unvaccinated people from restaurants."
23949,"Nice try moving the goalposts, though."

23951,I’m done 🏃🏻‍♂️
23952,"I read that part to mean he is opposed to things like vaccine checks for access to restaurants, travel, gyms, etc."
23953,not the vaccine per se.
23954,"I live in Florida, so I have no idea what these vaccine checks look like because it’s illegal here."
23955,I read New York will require proof of vaccination to eat at a restaurant.
23956,Is that true?
23957,"Do they allow a negative covid test also, or are people who can’t take the vaccine simply excluded?"
23958,"I completely agree, that's why the next rounds of wanna-bes are not getting the support."
23959,"Gaetz, Trump Jr, and Hawley."

23979,Goal posts are already on the move.
23980,Yeah that’s what I’d do too
23981,A large percentage of the military is already vaccinated -- this is not going to be a huge issue.
23982,What's a huge issue is an outbreak of COVID that limits military preparedness.
23983,"My parents live in FL (thankfully vaccinated, but they’re elderly)."
23984,They think he’s doing a great job.
23985,"&gt;	Over 50% of America is vaccinated

Not quite."
23986,"At least, not **fully** vaccinated."
23987,57% of the total population has had 1 shot.
23988,"I understand that helps, but it’s important to note **especially** with the Delta variant and discussions that a third shot may be needed to combat it."
23989,"Herd immunity was always going to be over 70%, tbh."
23990,Most professionals thought at least 80% and that was before Delta.
23991,Now it’s 80-90% as a consensus.
23992,"In other words, it’s just not going to happen."
23993,I literally linked to the actual hospitalizations across the whole United States.
23994,Did you bother to open it?
23995,And please link where there are 50k covid patients in hospitals right now.
23996,Jesus.
23997,The fucking link is right there.
23998,That's wild.
23999,"As far as things that would cause a lower chance at having kids go, the covid vaccine is pretty damn far down on the list."
24000,*Fully approving a vaccine and then authorizing a booster for it soon after might also offer conflicting messages about its effectiveness.
24001,"*

There's no conflict here: the vaccine works well, and more is even better."
24002,I wish they'd focus on promoting the best science rather than essentially trying to mislead people into doing the right thing.
24003,The deception approach backfired horribly with masks last year.
24004,"And call me heartless, but after a year and a half of staying in my house I got the vaccine and maybe the onus is now on the vulnerable to do their part."
24005,"I’d like to go visit my parents and see my siblings, which I haven’t done in like two years."
24006,If you listen carefully you can hear people running onto the field to pick up the goalposts.
24007,"The new percentages are: 58.49% for symptomatic infection against COVID-19, which ""remains significant,"" the advisor said."
24008,"Meanwhile, there is 86.02% effectiveness in preventing hospitalization; 89.68% in preventing admission to ICU; and 86.38% against death."
24009,"In other words, ""if the entire population had been vaccinated with Coronavac, 86 out of every 100 would not have died, so it continues to have a very good population performance,"" Araos said."
24010,"In summary: ""protection against infection against COVID-19 falls and protection for the most important outcomes is maintained,"" he added."
24011,I’m not confident.
24012,"Mostly because of stunads like you who talk out of both sides of their ass, pretending they know better than every public health professional on the planet."
24013,Cut the bullshit already.
24014,You are the problem.
24015,Oh and the word is “wane” btw.
24016,Most native English speakers would know that.
24017,Are you actually from this country?
24018,Just asking Bc a lot of misinformation from foreign sources with dubious motives gets sprayed on these subreddits like diarrhea.
24019,"[the data says otherwise](https://www.yahoo.com/entertainment/fully-vaccinated-people-quarter-covid-205000154.html)

the people saying that it's a small percentage have their head in the sand refusing to trust science"
24020,"His quote says ""clinical trials,"" which I think was about 10,000 unless I'm misremembering."
24021,I'm wondering if that's the case with the general population though.
24022,Has this happened with any other crowded major events?
24023,That sounds like brain damage.
24024,Surely she's been checked?
24025,And we still aren't requiring vaccine proof at festivals and venues.
24026,And I guess some business feel like requiring masks again is a better idea?
24027,It's less effective but social easier...really I don't get it.
24028,We're such dumdums
24029,That's seems like a lawsuit just waiting to happen.
24030,"Imagine a sick teacher comes in, and gives it to a child who winds up in an ICU."
24031,This is the first I’ve heard of funding loss… what kind of crazy is he
24032,Right.
24033,"It's 13x bigger than the UK though, which was my point."
24034,"""I'm young enough, I'd rather give it [the vaccine] to people who need it."
24035,I don't need it.
24036,"I'm a healthy, young individual that will continue to work on my health."
24037,"""I don't think taking the vaccine away from someone who needs it is a good thing."
24038,My dad is a perfect example.
24039,He got it [the vaccine] early on because he's a diabetic.
24040,People like that need to get it.
24041,My mom got it.
24042,I don't want to take away that ability.
24043,"""Now as time goes on, if it [the vaccine] is mainstream, really, really mainstream, then yeah."""
24044,This guy is a colossal idiot.
24045,"Back in January, with limited availability and much greater demand than supply, sure."
24046,Having a young athlete skip the line to take the vaccine dose away from an elderly or immunocompromised person would have been horrible.
24047,"Now, though, this is just him making excuses for being anti-vax."
24048,"There is enough supply out there for anyone who wants it, just walk in."
24049,No one who wants the vaccine isn't getting it because of a lack of availability.
24050,People who aren't getting vaccinated today are choosing to not get to.
24051,It's that simple.
24052,His comments further the fiction that young people are immune and that no one in his age group gets hospitalized or dies.
24053,Maybe he should shadow an ICU nurse in Florida to get a little more insight on his misguided beliefs.
24054,I graduated in 1993 and I sympathize.
24055,Sucks to be a student at any level today.
24056,"Well, up through the end of undergrad, if you're in the Master's or PhD program especially you need to learn to live with being miserable anyway."
24057,It's interesting to see where people's feelings on BLM track with their covid beliefs.
24058,Just an observation.
24059,They’re significantly less effective against delta though.
24060,"Israel published a report a week ago saying that Pfizer is only 39% effective at preventing infection with delta, and now the UK also says they’re seeing a huge drop in efficacy against delta."
24061,"Not quite as bad as what Israel reported, but in the same ballpark."
24062,Though we’re still in a period of uncertainty.
24063,"The CDC says that a vaccinated person can probably spread delta at the same rate as an unvaccinated person, but Israel says the vaccine cuts infectivity by half."
24064,There’s a lot we don’t know right now.
24065,"Everyone agrees that severe outcomes are a lot less likely with the vaccine, and long COVID is a bit less common in the vaccinated (though 20% is still terrifyingly high)."
24066,"But it looks like consensus is building that the vaccinated are not particularly well protected against contracting and spreading delta, though they are very unlikely to die."
24067,Policymakers are quite out of touch.
24068,The next Purge movie could adapt that concept.
24069,"If thats the case, I wonder how many people are being infected within just an hours time?"
24070,It's probably staggering nationwide....
24071,How would finically crippling a large portion of the population help lmfao
24072,Check out their subs.
24073,"They’re not happy with DeSantis, at all."
24074,[removed]
24075,"Not a health professional but honestly, the best solution seems to be for the US to donate more vaccine doses to countries that don’t have enough, especially African countries, most of which have under 10% partial vaccination rate."
24076,"We have more than enough for our own demand, but sending them to countries with low vax rates (and *higher* vax willingness than us) will help prevent more variants from appearing."
24077,"As far as I’m aware none of the major variants came from the US, so maybe the key is to prevent the spread elsewhere."
24078,amen
24079,"If you’re vaccinated and don’t have children, go."
24080,"Thank you, I appreciate the response."
24081,"Once again, you're pointing to specific actions of one country to try to explain why an entire region has performed better."
24082,It is true that China and Korea had dramatically better contact tracing than Germany.
24083,It is also true that Japan had substantially worse contact tracing than Germany.
24084,"There was good contact tracing in China, Korea, Vietnam, Hong Kong, Singapore."
24085,"There was bad contact tracing in Japan, Cambodia, Thailand, Myanmar, Laos."
24086,"Yet all of these countries have had dramatically better outcomes than every country in Europe, North America and Latin America."
24087,"In the group of East Asian countries doing great contact tracing, they have had *markedly better* results."
24088,"China and Korea both have lower mortality rates compared to Japan, but Japan is still 10x better than Germany."
24089,"&gt;Only a tiny fraction of people in Southeast Asia have been exposed to novel bat coronaviruses

This is not known, and is currently unknowable."
24090,"We don't even have a complete catalogue of all bat coronaviruses, but there are hundreds, and we have never tested the population for antibodies to the vast majority of them."
24091,"&gt;From the Chinese perspective, the unwillingness of Europeans andAmericans to just end the outbreaks in their countries once and for all -something which is entirely doable - is completely baffling."
24092,And I am saying one reason this perspective might be wrong is a failure to consider the naive reproductive rate of the virus in different populations.
24093,"I would love to hear a perspective on what Peru could possibly do to beat back the virus, which you say is *entirely doable*."
24094,The country has had ridiculously draconian restrictions for over a year.
24095,"Massive, massive disruptions to daily life to reduce mobility and social contact."
24096,Peru launched a mobile contact tracing app in April 2020.
24097,There is universal masking enforced by guys with guns.
24098,"What do you want the country to do to stop the pandemic, which has killed 0.5% of the entire population?"
24099,You can't just throw your hands up and point to some sociological phenomenon that everyone just assumes to be true.
24100,"You have to point to specific measures to reduce mobility, test and trace, and physically stop transmission from occurring, and contrast that not with the very best examples in Asia, but the cases like Japan, where the government has done nearly nothing, and the population still closely congregates in large numbers."

24115,"&gt;I didn't translate that section but the answer is in the article, basically they have two categories of deaths by Covid, confirmed and probable."
24116,"Ah, that explains it."
24117,Sinovac's numbers vs deaths also rose a bit - they had 80% in the study iirc.
24118,"&gt;And yes, Pfizer is skewed towards young people, AZ at the beginning also was skewed but now it is only given to men 45+ and women 60+."
24119,"What I mean is that since the 50+ age group is predominantly vaccinated with Sinovac, then either way Pfizer &amp; AZ data is going to be mostly sampled from the younger population."
24120,"Considering that, it seems that AZ &amp; Sinovac perform more or less similarly, while Pfizer is better."
24121,"However, it would be interesting to see CIs for Pfizer &amp; AZ since I have doubts that they really have 100% efficacy vs deaths (and vs hospitalizations &amp; ICU for AZ), probably simply not enough samples and a big CI."
24122,"I wonder how many people were vaccinated with AZ in total though because at some moment Chile halted its rollout completely, then added the age restrictions that you mentioned."
24123,I wish they would tell the split in the study cohort for each vaccine.
24124,I had covid about 18 months ago.
24125,I still have my antibodies.
24126,"That being said, when I get the vaccine, will it feel like I’m going through covid all over again, or is it safe to assume I’ll get both shots without any side effects?"
24127,"I have a question:

At cdc.gov, [New Hospital Admissions (COVID)](https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#new-hospital-admissions was)) has an interactive graph for Florida (under the drop-down for jurisdictions: you have to get past the administrative regions to see the states)."

24129,Obviously.
24130,Yes the government is subsiding it.
24131,But you’re not getting government coverage without providing a social security number.

24134,It’s so obvious you have no idea what you’re talking about.

24212,That's why they're telling people who've had Covid that they need to vaccinated.
24213,There's merit to it.
24214,This is an extraordinary circumstance and it calls for something different
24215,I am vaccinated and I have this opinion about folks who are eligible for vaccination but choose not to.

24229,Why not?
24230,"If anything, kids are more flexible than adults."
24231,The issue is that school districts in hotspots aren’t offering any options such as required masks or virtual learning.
24232,Many parents aren’t comfortable sending their unvaccinated kids  to school in that environment.
24233,"While the kids themselves may not be at risk, they are still spreaders"
24234,"This data says 137, 288, 124, and 37 pediatric deaths for the 2008-09, 2009-10, 2010-11, and 2011-12 US influenza seasons, respectively."

24360,But was it a complication of X due to covid?

24362,They're very different things.
24363,"If someone is shot in the chest, lives to make it to the hospital, and died 2 days later, and then his tests comes back and shows that he had covid, did he die from Covid, or a gushot wound to the chest?"

24365,"It’s a very dumb comparison but quite frankly this mentality that not being comfortable with the coming vaccine passports indicates you’re insane is kind of crazy to me, it’s literally never been done and it’s frankly a rather large infringement on your basic ability to go places."

24377,We’re fighting a virus while learning about it at the same time.
24378,[removed]
24379,Okay so the 75-85% effectiveness is the CDC’s rough estimate of the protection the vaccines provide against transmissible infection from reviewing the evidence and doing some stats — that means that a vaccinated person is 75-85% less likely to be infected than an unvaccinated person.
24380,The 3-fold thing is a bit harder to interpret — I think they’re trying to say that based on the Israeli data as a comfortable lower bound for safety?
24381,"Not certain there, but they’re saying it should be communicated that a vaccinated individual is 3x less likely to get infected as an unvaccinated person."
24382,"Yeah, I was fortunate to be gifted *The Great Influenza* early in the pandemic and I’ve returned to it a few times since then for a sense of context."
24383,I think it’s likeliest we see two more waves (the current one and one in the fall/winter) and then watch it recede into endemicity.
24384,That's simply not true.
24385,Covid count is 416 under 18.
24386,2014-2015 flu was 803.
24387,"I'm not saying 416 isn't bad of course, of course it's terrible and we don't know where it goes from here but those are the counts right now."
24388,"Yup, but I can’t afford a hospital bill and our hospitals in the US are collapsing so it’s still important."

We also plan on having them gargle with salt water and spraying their nose with saline then blowing it out after school to decrease any potential viral load."
24396,We also made sure they have the best kids masks - ASTM Level 3 certified masks only.
24397,I highly doubt they would be able to be in a KN95 mask all day at school.
24398,That's simply not true though.
24399,"The CDC admits myocarditis is a concern for young men as a side effect of vaccination (somewhere between 1/5,000 and 1/14,000)."
24400,Everyone above 30 should get Pfizer/Moderna - but they really need to approve AZ and J&amp;J for the high risk group among males.
24401,Village idiots got together and every village idiot gets a megaphone : social media 101
24402,"For me, I’m thinking it means I’m going to double mask it indoors again and try to stay 6ft away."
24403,I know that 2 masks are around 80% effective so that helps soothe my anxiety.
24404,In the study in was a surgical disposal mask and a cloth mask.
24405,Although I have a family vacay at the end of the month and I’m not sure.
24406,"It’s only 6 people but we’ve been going around without masks, hanging out with other people who are unvaccinated."

24410,"COVID literally causes pneumonia, but he was still willing to remove Covid from from those death certificates."
24411,He knew it wasn’t right but was interested in plausible deniability.
24412,"&gt;	The Macon County coroner omitted COVID-19 on at least a half-dozen death certificates in cases where another major factor — **pneumonia in an elderly patient** or “you know, grandma had one lung and smoked all her life,” for example — could be **justified** as the sole cause of death."
24413,https://www.kansascity.com/news/coronavirus/article253147128.html#storylink=cpy
24414,This behavior seems vaguely familiar...
24415,"In a high prevalence area I bet you will find a lot of ""asymptomatic"" positives who simply came into contact with the virus and then swiftly fended off the infection."
24416,This is why the CDC was at one time not recommending surveillance testing of fully vaxxed individuals.
24417,Now Delta changed their minds on that but the group I described almost certainly still exists.
24418,"The Hillsborough Board of County Commissioners are majority D after the last election, so while county government has been known to be, well, a shitshow at times, it's not the split or majority R makeup it used to be."
24419,"It *should* be more on par with Tampa proper now, but I haven't kept up much with the BOCC in 2021 tbh."
24420,Regarding incentives: where's my $100 for getting vaxxed early on?
24421,Right.
24422,"If Florida had great vaccination uptake, went through waves of *enforced* lockdowns, *enforced* mask wearing, with electronic contract tracing…

However, because none of that really happened in Florida, they’re not comparable."
24423,Florida has been “open” and doing free-dumb things for pretty much the whole pandemic.
24424,It’s just now catching up to them bc delta is that transmissible and everybody is inside in the AC.
24425,"So if we just said “no restrictions” in Florida as a result of them not putting in any of the work that the UK had done, the outcome will be different which is exactly what we’re seeing play out."
24426,I’m tired of WHO and other developing countries telling the developed countries to hold back on protecting their citizens in favor of sending vaccines to other countries.
24427,"I get it and I agree that helping other countries vaccinate is the moral thing to do but if supply is not up to par with demand, they should not be telling us to sacrifice our own citizens in favor of others."
24428,I have also heard people complaining that the US made vaccines available to people under 20 and hoping to make them available to kids under 12 in winter.
24429,Don’t come at us for wanting to protect our kids —the future of our nation—from death and other long term effects of infection that we don’t even fully understand.
24430,These vaccines are being paid for by taxpayer money and as a taxpayer I’d be livid if the US decided not to vaccinate our kids once the shots are approved by the FDA for kids in favor of shipping those doses to developing countries.
24431,This fits one of Reddit’s favorite sayings-you shouldn’t  set yourself on fire to keep other people warm.
24432,"Yeah, I don't think this map is right for Vermont."
24433,Vermont is the most vaccinated state in the country.
24434,No way they have that many red spots.
24435,The entire us government has no idea what they’re doing.
24436,The information was factual if not closely related to covid
24437,"Because the vast majority of the unvaccinated at this point are stupid, selfish, and dangerous."

24445,Womp and prayers
24446,There may be a chance your school requires vaccines?
24447,Lots of universities in the US are doing that.
24448,And make sure you wear N95s if you haven't.

24456,It’s so miserable.
24457,Long covid is simply the latest of a long line of expressed concerns by those who have anxious personalities and have been afraid since the start of the pandemic.
24458,Some real concerns (too much stress on the healthcare system).
24459,Some false (such as kids being at risk or that long covid is a real threat).
24460,Variants For All Time.
24461,Always.
24462,Im pretty sure it’s just the actual distribution of the oxygen not the supply.
24463,If shit really hits the fan they’ll send in the national guard or the federal COVID response team.
24464,This article explains the various issues better.
24465,"https://www.phillyvoice.com/delta-variant-covid-19-vaccine-natural-immunity/

The answer is again yes, the vaccine is stronger than natural immunity to Delta and infection from previous variants doesn’t seem to translate to Delta as well."
24466,Preliminary reports also suggest Delta Plus binds to the lungs better and transmits even faster with an even higher viral load.
24467,"Like the article says, both the antibody evading variants and the uneven level of immunity from natural infections in general are an issue."
24468,"Remember, not everybody develops the same amount of antibodies or level of immunity, especially with asymptomatic cases."
24469,"What I’m saying is, that’s a hefty chunk of the naturally infected population with either no developed immune response (~10%) and/or significantly weaker response to variants, which means more mutation chances."
24470,"I don’t think a vaccine evading strain is likely, but that’s a rough ride for the unvaccinated as this stuff continues to mutate and circulate itself into a hopefully less lethal form."
24471,It also includes an unknown mix of AZ.
24472,Which is known to have lower efficacy than Pfizer.
24473,It makes me wonder how much evolutionary pressure our behavior as a society puts on the virus.
24474,"A virus that is super transmissible yet never elicits any symptoms (or super mild ones) would be very fit because we wouldn’t try to stop its spread at all with masks, distancing, or even vaccines."
24475,"But perhaps those behavioral changes, especially considering that not all comply with them, are not strong enough to influence the virus’ evolution."
24476,Beef and dairy cows are clearly more important to the bottom line
24477,why is covid mutating at a faster rate than say flu?
24478,"Even with the prevalence of flu since the 1900's, there is only a few strains through a couple of generations."
24479,Yet we have a whole laundry list of strains for COVID in 18 months.
24480,How is that?
24481,I mean wouldn’t you want to sanitize Florida technically
24482,"Oh sure, let me elaborate."
24483,"I’m largely saying it’s out of our control and that’ll it’ll get worse before it gets better, which is pretty scary."
24484,I get the sense that people would much rather see us *do something* to stop this.
24485,But it seems like Delta is a relentless and unstoppable force that’ll burn through the unvaccinated pretty fast.
24486,It brings an end sooner than later… but not in a pretty way.
24487,In a way we absolutely should’ve avoided via vaccines.
24488,"But that, very sadly, didn’t happen."
24489,"Doctors here are in the high 90s, but our nurses are around 50% and aids are even worse."
24490,"We have a ""nurse to anti-vax pipeline"" problem in the US."
24491,"Seems to be a growing number of cases of people, often only having had mild cases of covid having long term loss of smell and taste."
24492,If and when it returns they report everything tasting and smelling of rotten meat or generally bad.
24493,May not be on the same level as some side effects but definately life changing in a lot of ways.
24494,^^Floats ^^away
24495,"So, just so I'm clear... your argument is that everyone who has someone they're worried about will be staying home - disregarding how most industries don't actually allow for that."
24496,"And that when they do go out, ***they*** will be wearing masks - disregarding how mask use is primarily to protect everyone **except** the wearer by preventing someone infected (whether they know it or not) from spreading."
24497,So because the people who actually need protecting are acting to protect ***everyone they interact with***... you don't need to do your part to protect them?
24498,"And without a mandate, no students will be wearing one."
24499,"Even if they wanted to, it would make them a target for bullying, and would anyway be a rather useless gesture with the majority opting not to."
24500,"I tried asking this in the daily discussion thread and it got removed, but I think it's very relevant here: what is the endgame?"
24501,Is it convincing antivaxxers to get vaccinated (good luck)?
24502,Is it getting under-12's vaccinated?
24503,What exactly is the goalpost that we're working towards?
24504,Damn.
24505,That sucks.
24506,I wish they had been around in 1984 when I was high all the time.
24507,[removed]
24508,"IMO, it was only crazy to say ""Covid is like the flu"" when it was brand new."
24509,"It really is becoming like the flu now that so many people have some-to-total immunity, and I think it's okay to say that."
24510,because we didn't finish testing them yet.
24511,I have a feeling the US is too large to assume it is all on the same track.
24512,This might be true for the south but the northern states have clearly shown some resistance to this wave - probably from seasonality.
24513,So I wonder if it comes as a one two punch like the summer/winter waves again.
24514,"That includes me and you, too, buddy."
24515,But go ahead and tell me all about how humans aren't generally stupid as hell despite being the smartest thing on the planet.

24609,It does not get to respond to the unchanging innards.
24610,"One promising angle for a long-term flu vaccine is to target an element of that sheath that doesn't change, which is the stem that holds out the proteins that change so readily."
24611,"The stem doesn't change so much, so if our bodies could learn to spot that first, we'd have an immune response to every single version of the sheath."
24612,"If we had a vaccine that did that, the flu would also become a virus you could gain permanent immunity to."

24627,He's so focused on his day to day life that he just was clueless.
24628,By the time his age group came up for vaccines the covid numbers in the US had cratered.

&gt;Many of the patients with Covid-19 now arriving at the hospital are not just **unvaccinated** — they are much younger than 50, a stark departure from the frail, older patients seen when the pandemic first surged last year."
24879,&gt;Physicians working in Covid hot spots across the nation say that the patients in their hospitals are not like the patients they saw last year.
24880,"**Almost always unvaccinated**, the new arrivals tend to be younger, many in their 20s or 30s."
24881,"And they seem sicker than younger patients were last year, deteriorating more rapidly."

Yes, but you have to consider the availability and capacity to administer the vaccines."

24913,"Now, because the protection afforded from the 1st dose gave great protection from severe disease &amp; death (as they did for Wuhan and alpha strain), lives were saved by delaying the booster thus freeing up another 1st dose to give to someone else."

24951,"Maaaybe if we had a better rollout and comms plan we might avoid a third jab, but I don’t think we could have avoided delta emerging."

25144,"Could just be a matter of timeline, ya know?"
25145,Lambda and delta could combine though
25146,"The spread of covid misinformation isn't a conspiracy theory, it's one of the biggest problems in public health right now."
25147,"Again, he is not more at risk from the vaccine than the virus."
25148,That is misinformation.
25149,I can't make this any clearer.

25151,No please...
25152,This is what the people wanted.
25153,Is this even a safe thing for a city to do before we have FDA guidance on booster strategy?
25154,"I live in Park county and mask wearing, at least in stores, is creeping back up to where it was in the spring over the last few weeks."
25155,"It’s surprising, in many ways, as the county has very low vaccination numbers."
25156,It’s either because people truly don’t want to get sick or they just do what the crowd does.
25157,Yup.
25158,"I've had strangers on reddit telling me I'm setting my children up for lifelong trauma and social problems by continuing with distance learning, as if I wouldn't notice my own children struggling with isolation."
25159,"Hahahahaha

You two were at least able to stay home for the majority of the pandemic so far."
25160,Some people never had that Luxury ever.
25161,Someone has to run the factories.
25162,Yep.
25163,I wish we could build a fucking wall and moat around the actual cities of Tampa and St. Pete and let the rest of Hillsborough and Pinellas fend for them fucking selves.
25164,I won't even get into Pasco and Polk counties because there be dragons.
25165,"Kids have also died from swimming, riding in a moving car, [getting into a stationary car](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/ohio-teenager-suffocates-van-after-twice-calling-911-leading-investigation-n865746), and [opening a freezer."

25168,Yeah I still have to wear a mask at work because I work in a healthcare setting.
25169,I still can’t freely travel because of the virus.
25170,"That’s not normal, but it is “mostly normal”."
25171,"I have concert tickets for next month, I’ve traveled domestically, I’ve attended sporting events."
25172,But I’ve not been back to the way it was pre-COVID because I’m literally not able to do so because we can’t get out of this pandemic.
25173,"But sure, I’m “scared shitless”."
25174,lol go away
25175,At this point can we just let them die?
25176,It seems to be what they desire.
25177,I don't understand why they are still being given (literally) breathing space.
25178,Freedom to punish oneself and to spread a deadly pathogen to others?
25179,You are a very odd person.
25180,"Shit, it probably did!"
25181,I personally know people who don't want to get the J&amp;J vaccine (and are skeptical of the other ones too) because of the blood clot thing.
25182,Whether or not it's a legitimate concern for their demographic.
25183,[removed]
25184,The harsh truth is that there isn't any guarantee that it ever will.
25185,"If we're lucky enough that the virus has a limited amount of possible immune escape mutations, we might get to a point where new variants don't evade the vaccine."
25186,"But that's an if, not a when."
25187,It's also possible that scientists could make a new vaccine that's able to repel all coronaviruses.
25188,"But again, that's an if, not a when."
25189,"The possibility that social distancing and lockdowns become a normality for many generations is, sadly, impossible to deny."
25190,"Then, I guess, it would end like other pandemics: so many people would have died of this that it's spread would slow down, as well as it's mutation rate."
25191,That doesn't make him smart.
25192,I've worked with Ivy leaguers and they aren't as smart as you'd come to expect.
25193,Time to proclaim him as incompetent because he failed at his job as a governor.
25194,Calling him smart because he's abusing his power while making terrible policy decisions doesn't do justice.
25195,"Time to call him what he really is, the people of FL need to see him for what he is, a failed leader."
25196,Tried with my anti-vax parents.
25197,They won't budge.
25198,They read in 6 places on the internet that the vaccine is dangerous.
25199,Nevermind the tens of thousands of sources that say it's safe.
25200,All of those sources are lying of course.
25201,"Also, Tucker Carlson is appointment TV for them, so it's not surprising."
25202,"Had to tell them that they can't be around their unvaccinated (because of age) grandchildren, until they, or my kids are vaccinated the other day, that was fun."
25203,Why not?
25204,Explain it to me.
25205,You know what really grinds my gears.
25206,"For weeks vaccinated people that got infected with the Delta Variant, exhibited symptoms of headache, sore throat, \*lots of sneezing and runny noses."
25207,"But here's the CDC this week saying 'Break-Through' infections, which only occur in 1% of vaccinated folks can infect others."
25208,Well their symptomology for those 'Break-through' infections list ALL the symptoms of COVID-19.
25209,The first group I mentioned above didn't have any respitory issues at all and almost none had a fever.
25210,Very similar to seasonal allergies.
25211,But surely the group I mentioned above can pass on the virus to others.
25212,"So CDC, it isn't 1% of vaccinated folks that can pass on the virus to others, it's a crapload more people."
25213,So we need the mask mandates again and they need to educate the public to pay attention to how they are feeling and get tested if they exhibit those mild symptoms.
25214,"We're not ""bracing"" we're shaking our collective heads and just getting ready for it."
25215,We've known since day 1 that the second the FDA fully approved it it would be mandated
25216,Except that one time
25217,So I got my (edit: unofficial) 3rd pfizer dose yesterday.
25218,"Similar effects as second dose, which for me were minimal (sore arm, a little tired)

Question for others — How are you managing your two CDC cards now?"
25219,Have you transferred your booster info over to your original?
25220,Could I just ask my pharmacist to write it over?
25221,"No, my feelings weren’t hurt."

25231,We know this virus is so dangerous because it mutates so rapidly and it is impossible to consciously control it when so many people have asymptomatic cases.
25232,It will be controlled when we have herd immunity across the world.
25233,"We are not close to herd immunity in Amercia, let alone globally."
25234,When will we achieve herd immunity?
25235,"When we respond to this as a pandemic, instead of as a political issue and a culture war."
25236,"If trump had come out and urged everyone to get a vaccine, we would likely already be at herd immunity now in America."
25237,"If he did this today, we could have herd immunity in about 2 months."
25238,Because it won't.
25239,But we can make it weak enough to just live with it.
25240,"&gt;In a video on her channel, Pope said she wants to promote health the way her generation’s grandparents experienced it."
25241,"&gt;“When they got sick, they didn’t need the crutch of pharmaceuticals or antibiotics to get better,” she said in the video."
25242,"“They just got sick and they got well.”

Just...what?"
25243,Is she intentionally dense?
25244,My own grandfather barely survived polio and I'm so grateful that we have a vaccine for it.
25245,Wizard's First Rule fits perfectly for too many this last year/these last couple of years (maybe forever?).

:("
25247,I saw someone with a face shield during our mask break!
25248,"They didn't ever do anything anyway, so why wear them when you don't even need to pretend to care anymore?"
25249,Ester on ester crime.
25250,Tried it still smokes.
25251,It is not even persistent long term symptoms.
25252,It drops from around 4% to less than 2% when you move to 8 weeks.
25253,It's just lingering symptoms which seems much less worrisome.
25254,Bad colds can take a while to resolve.
25255,"Sometimes you get sinus/chest/ear infections that extend the entire cold and then the ""break up"" seems to take forever."
25256,This.
25257,Why do we have so many anti-vaxxers and other conspiracy theorists in America?
25258,"Because our highly religious society teaches that it's ok, and even admirable, to believe in fairy tales when the truth makes you sad."
25259,"And so, naturally, many extend that method of thinking to outside the church too."
25260,"Sure, individual selfishness plays a factor."
25261,"But don’t discount the pressure of a capitalistic system to return to normal, even when that normal necessitates mass sickness and death."
25262,"Incentivize vaccinations, booster shots, upgrade ventilation systems in public places, avoid dense indoor gatherings, continue to normalize indoor mask wearing, etc, it's not all hopeless."
25263,"Pfizer is too, right?"
25264,It’d have to be a single dose vaccine.
25265,The logistics of blow darting a random person exactly 3 or 4 weeks apart seems too complicated.
25266,My point is that no state governments or local governments are using the logic you're using.
25267,"You're projecting it onto the situation as the dominant reason for mask mandates and for masking, but when decisions about such things are being made, the rationales don't match your own."
25268,"""such reasons"" refers simply to the reasons you offered in your original post."
25269,Where did I say anything about how many dead kids are ok?
25270,"My point may tangentially relate to this, though, in that I'd say that zero mask mandate decisions have been made based on the idea that we must have zero dead kids or adults."
25271,That would require total shutdown rather than mask mandates.
25272,So all these decisions-- all the decisions made by the governing bodies of your fellow Americans-- are assuming that some dead kids are ok.

25274,You seem like a smart person trying to use logic while possessing zero medical expertise.
25275,The drummer got GBS from a childhood vaccine.
25276,He STILL has it and it has progressed with worse symptoms.
25277,"His personal doctor (a neurologist) advises against getting the vaccine at this time, which is very standard advice for those with vaccine-related GBS."
25278,For him the vaccine can ABSOLUTELY be more harmful than the virus **which he already got** with mild symptoms (and obtaining natural immunity to boot).
25279,"By the way the link between covid and GBS is basically zero, if you read something about it last fall those speculations have been disproven by recent major studies."
25280,It's honestly impressive how your entire take away from his very reasoned explanation is that the entire thing is a ruse to slip in some misinformation and stoke anti-vaxx sentiment.
25281,Almost as amazing as thinking that his band member's biology degree is somehow more relevant to this situation than a medical doctor's professional opinion.
25282,This virus just keep on giving
25283,UNC is one of the most elite schools in the country.
25284,How was this not already in place?
25285,I truly do not understand why this is all so hard for people to understand.
25286,"I guess people really can't deal with the fact that we can say what *might* happen, but not for sure what *will* happen."
25287,People don't do well with uncertainty.
25288,But I personally don't think any of this is difficult to understand.
25289,Covid will very likely not die out like Polio.
25290,"It has too high of a mutation rate to be wiped out, and it can also infect tons of other animal species, meaning it can always retreat into animal populations and come back."
25291,"What we will achieve after the end of the pandemic is an endemic situation, where waves of the disease will still happen (similar to the flu), but because of the vaccination, the population as a whole is not immunologically naive and will therefore rarely get severe symptoms."
25292,"Because of the immunity, it also can't infect as many people at once."
25293,Both of these factors will lead to lower death rates and prevent hospitals from being overflown.
25294,"The virus will not disappear, we're just creating a situation in which we can live with it a lot better than we could a year ago"
25295,"No, the mandates will only have the effect of forcing local businesses in the area to turn away potential customers, the majority POC."
25296,We're talking 50-60% of Bronx residents won't be able to sit in for a slice of pizza.
25297,Great work everyone.
25298,"This is a clear indication that the Biden administration decision to roll back mask mandates for vaccinated people ""to incentivize getting a vaccine"" was simply stupid."
25299,Stunningly stupid.
25300,"I'll put the administrations refusal to support, develop, and roll out a Federal vaccine passport as similarly stupid."
25301,We're going to 60 different and incompatible systems over different time frames with lower security.
25302,The road to Hell is paved with good intentions and the administration is not only dropping the ball but kicking it away.
25303,You mean like how kamala Harris said vaccines were rushed while trump was in office?
25304,This article is horribly written.
25305,I assume your school has around 1300 students.
25306,The 4.4% is of people that have symptoms not that test positive.
25307,It is 0.1% of people that test positive.
25308,So it will be 1-2 students that are sick for a month for your school.
25309,You are foolish and risking your health.
25310,You would rather roll the dice with the virus that we know has long term effects than take a vaccine.
25311,It’s not a smart decision for anyone.
25312,Why would you want natural immunity which means you have to be infected first?
25313,"Also, we have know since January 2020 that asymptomatic people spread infection so waiting for symptoms isn’t saving anyone from your contagion."
25314,False.
25315,Look up Tiberius database.
25316,[removed]
25317,India was one of the first countries to lock down in 2020...
25318,It was criticized strongly for perhaps being premature.
25319,"So next time the government doesn't lock down...

Also the spread in 2021 happened from Mumbai where there was no elections or religious festivals."
25320,All that stuff is news trying to find a reason to pin govt when no one actually knows what caused spread and why it ended...
25321,cowpox ftw!
25322,Wah?
25323,Hospitals and Doctors should close to unvaccinated people at this point.
25324,See how fast they get the jab then.
25325,End of story.
25326,Virus over.
25327,Why is this not being done?
25328,They'd probably drop out.
25329,And didn't clinical trials test for symptomatic infection?
25330,People forget that the vaccine isn't a force field that magically repels the virus from entering your body.
25331,It can enter your body and there's a chance PCR can detect the genetic material in it.
25332,However your body is trained enough to eliminate it maybe before you develop symptoms or at worse you develop cold-like or flu-like symptoms.
25333,how does that help anyone?
25334,are you really that stupid?
25335,Ship sailed long ago my dude.
25336,Plot is totally lost.
25337,It is not all that easy to declare bankruptcy anymore - the laws have changed in the past decade on that.
25338,That makes a lot of sense honestly.
25339,"I just want to keep in mind how much more we know now vs. last year, and how much more hope there is now in things improving."
25340,I understand the urge to panic but I also want people to stop being mega downers.
25341,Don't let the headlines scare you.
25342,Get your hesitant family and friends vaccinated.
25343,A dear friend of mine is going in for his first dose of Pfizer this evening.
25344,Cool!
25345,You can join the people who don’t believe in COVID right over there.
25346,Christ.
25347,You don’t understand how this works at all.
25348,The vaccine you deny sits in storage and then gets thrown out.
25349,It doesn’t get shipped to Botswana because you said “no thanks”
25350,Same thing happened in Flint.
25351,They didn't even need a water expert.
25352,I firmly believe they could've called *any* scientist and would have gotten a much better option than what they ended up doing.
25353," I'm very thankful for them, since it meant that I could get my first dose much sooner than expected."
25354,Looks like dude did also spout a good amount of antivax BS in his reply.
25355,So it ain’t just GBS.

25357,"No doubt, that's what makes his words &amp; actions here particularly dangerous"
25358,They don’t even care that they may leave their kids without a parent.
25359,"That’s my point you stupid idiot, that even with the magical vaccine this person is still scared shitless."
25360,“Mostly normal”😂😂😂
25361,&gt; ...it doesn't require studies to use common sense.
25362,"Science exists because we can't trust ""common sense""."
25363,Right but I’m talking about people in places where you’re not forced to wear one.
25364,There are no mandates near me and basically no store requires it yet you still see the mask below the nose.
25365,I did indeed go to walgreens for both doses.
25366,I'll go there and ask.
25367,I have my emails too from both shot dates.
25368,No shit.
25369,"And here's the thing, we have known (and everyone has been told) that this requirement was likely FROM THE VERY BEGINNING due to the nature of coronaviruses and the medical realities."
25370,"However, they will make the slippery slope argument and further dispute documented facts."
25371,And Bulgaria is even worse.
25372,"&gt; just like the political divide there's almost no ""middle ground"", and ""swayable"" moderates."
25373,"Regarding masks, I disagree."
25374,What we are seeing is that most people are just swayed by trends.
25375,"They don't really want to wear a mask, but they don't have a strong opinion and just follow the crowd."
25376,"When the first 10-20% started taking them off, the majority quickly took them off too."
25377,Its also why some areas had persistently high mask usage even after mandates were removed.
25378,"Without that first 10-20% willing to ignore the trends and take masks off, the majority kept them on."
25379,We still have subreddits encouraging this behavior.
25380,The auto moderators here censor posts that talk about Tr#mp or Republ#cans for supposedly derailing the discussion (even though I'd argue you can't meaningfully talk about a pandemic without understanding the context of public policy)
25381,Uneducated*
25382,Not in today's political environment.
25383,"From the CDC site on Smallpox

""In the past, between 14 and 52 people out of every 1 million people vaccinated for the first time experienced potentially life-threatening reactions."
25384,"These reactions require immediate medical attention...""

""Based on past experience, it is estimated that 1 to 2 people out of every 1 million people vaccinated could die as a result of life-threatening reactions to the vaccine."""
25385,"this should be the way, too easy to photoshop the cards and buy fakes."
25386,Lucky.
25387,We were all required to go back to the office full time a couple weeks ago.
25388,"When a new pandemic comes, the questions will be precisely the same as before."
25389,"Origin, symptoms, incubation period, infectiousness, transmission vectors, and mortality."
25390,Why make this political?
25391,There was no need.
25392,"If you're standing on the ""don't know long term effects"" stance regarding the vaccine, then yes lol"

**Over two weeks, 7/15/21-7/29/21, there was a 3% increase in the cumulated number of child COVID-19 cases (110,380 cases added (4,087,916 to 4,198,296))**"

25496,I moisturize as normal and then rub in plain petroleum jelly over the area that will be covered by the mask.

25498,This keeps my skin from drying out and buffers it against irritation from the mask rubbing.

25554,"They are not all equivalent, but you are making grand claims about long covid that are not based in fact."
25555,"The idea that long covid, as a post viral syndrome, is worse than past viral syndromes is an unfounded claim."
25556,You're downplaying the impact of viral syndromes to make a hyperbolic point about COVID which is not based in reality.
25557,"More people get long covid because more people are getting covid and have less protection against it, because we have less collective immunity than we do than against other viruses."
25558,"Long covid, in of itself, is not a worse viral syndromes than others."
25559,"Once enough people get vaccinated/infected, it will becomes like any other post viral syndrome, which is what all studies in the UK are showing us."
25560,I honestly don't understand where this opinion comes from.
25561,It amounts to saying you want less information because clearly multiplying two numbers together loses information compared to keeping them separate.
25562,I.e.
25563,you can't go backwards from positivity rate to case rate but you can always derive positivity rate from case rate and test rate.
25564,So this opinion has always mystified me...
25565,Everybody is going to get it.
25566,We knew this from the beginning.
25567,[deleted]
25568,absolutely.
25569,But my point is that a lot of people act like this is what *everyone* wants.
25570,the hard truth is that the virus will never be going away for a very long time (a decade+).
25571,In order to eliminate the threat of mutations for a virus as contagious as this you need to vaccine the entirety of humanity on this planet.
25572,That's no small feat.
25573,"Vaccines will have to be used as prophylactics, just like flu shots."
25574,"And more $$$ has to be thrown into advanced therapies like Regeneron so that even if someone is unvaxxed (or has waning immunity from their shots) and catches corona, they can get a shot or prescription pill course that will prevent hospitalization."
25575,think about those who cant get vaccinated before letting then 'meet their fate'.
25576,That’s too bad.
25577,Does your state have a program that requires state funds to ‘travel’ to a private or charter school?
25578,"Also, idk if you’ve tried this, but there may be some online charter schools out there… Best of luck!"
25579,I'm wearing a mask until this is over.
25580,I don't care how long it takes.
25581,Wearing a mask is the biggest non issue of the decade.
25582,"And yet Denmark is listed by the US gov / CDC as a Level 3 ""high risk"" travel location."
25583,Could it be that the vaccines are not as effective as advertised?
25584,Surely at least some of the 15% unvaccinated have natural immunity.
25585,Shouldn't this have dropped infections by well over 90%?
25586,It's the same story in Malta and Gibraltar.
25587,The numbers are just not supporting the 96% effectiveness advertised by the pharmas.
25588,I'm just comparing to Trump

25606,"Just a few short weeks ago things were looking so much better, we went to Vegas to meet a friend for dinner and ate inside with masks off for the first time since the beginning, but only a week or two later I could see what was coming and we went back to double-masking and caution again."

25668,"“In all, Marienburg said, 21 family members either tested positive for COVID-19 or showed symptoms of the virus."

25757,"If you’re in that community and you can’t tell this situation and this vaccine is different, you’re a moron and you’re dragging this out while endangering the lives of others."

25764,"(Not his exact words, but that was his point.)"
25765,The possibilities for new variants are almost limitless.
25766,Most viral pandemics disproportionately kill infants and young children.
25767,"During the 1918 flu pandemic, the virus sickened victims so quickly they sometimes dropped dead on the street or at work."
25768,Diseases like Ebola make people haemorrhage from their orifices.
25769,"Much safer thing, get an avocado shark!"

25922,"At this point, even new variants should spread less rapidly, even if the protection isn't 100%."
25923,It might take years to get everyone vaccinated because there is so much resistance.
25924,"Those people are probably also resistant to masks, distancing, and everything else that may help slow the spread."
25925,"Eventually, we reach some equilibrium where we have as much protection as we are going to get, Covid still spreads around a lot, people die needlessly, but hopefully we aren't filling the hospitals all the time."
25926,"This isn't really an end game, because I think if we look at a long enough timeframe (say, ten or twenty years) the vaccine will be normalized enough people will be getting it with their MMR shots and everything else."

26030,If you test 3 sick people it’s 100% positivity.
26031,If you test 3 healthy people it’s 0%.
26032,The positivity rate is a flawed concept from a statistical standpoint since it essentially has no control group.

26034,"And as a biological parent with a connection that one without children of their own wouldn’t understand , and person of critical thinking and common sense I appreciate the research and understand where it all comes from."
26035,But I think if you asked questions to the parents who wish not to expose their children to this virus are also very involved and find ways to engage their children both socially and in their development without throwing them in a setting with others that have parents that don’t care or are to busy to bother.
26036,"I’m not saying they are bad parents but their are other ways without sacrificing development, social experience and health."

26044,I don’t think the vaccine is more dangerous to kids than Covid.
26045,It’s not approved because they’re figuring out the efficacy in kids and the right size dosage to give the best immune response.
26046,"Once that gets figured out, approval probably isn’t too far away."
26047,Children are still humans so it’s not like the vaccine will effect them a whole lot different than adults.
26048,The heart inflammation is a rare side effect.
26049,Maybe your problem is living around shitheads.

26064,"Do you mean for example if Pfizer got approval first and you had J&amp;J or Moderna, or are you talking about being vaccinated outside the US with a totally different vaccine like AZ or Sinovac?"
26065,I assume any vaccine that is conditionally approved in the US would work to meet the requirements but I'm not sure about the ones being used in other countries.
26066,The article addresses that and says that what you are saying can't be the reason.
26067,"I have no doubt China will control it since they are doing 1) mass testing if there is any case, 2) pretty high level of vaccine coverage already."
26068,It probably is quite costly for China since it is summer travel season.
26069,China has at least 61% vaccine coverage according to Bloomberg.
26070,"Although Chinese vaccines is not efficacy as those mRNA ones, its vaccine does look like it will reduce transmission quite bit, specially if the person is asymptomatic."
26071,"Look at the Nanjing, the initial outbreak, it is now down to 3 cases today."
26072,There are a couple of cities in Anhui that only have one asymptomatic person each.
26073,"After doing mass testing, they didn't find any other people who is infected."
26074,"it is pretty clear asymptomatic vaccinated person, even with Chinese vaccine, don't transmit much."
26075,Me too!
26076,I’m just wondering how they check this stuff.
26077,I live in a shitty conservative town and I’ve heard lots of talk of faking vaccine cards.
26078,I’m just curious how they’re verified.
26079,Some people’s immune system will not respond to the vaccine if they’re on long term immunosuppressants such as anti rejection medication and steroids my doctor keeps telling me.
26080,There’s a percentage of us that cannot get the vaccine and don’t have GBS.
26081,"From the article about the UK:

&gt;""One thing it doesn’t mean, says Edmunds, is that the United Kingdom has built up enough population immunity through vaccination and natural infection to stop the virus spreading."
26082,"“The drop in cases is unprecedented to some extent, in that it seemed to occur everywhere,” he says — something which has been previously seen only after lockdowns."
26083,"“But herd immunity would come in different places at different times.”

Overall changes in human behavior could do it, though, and India imposed a strict lockdown."

26372,Don’t just say this without backing it up.
26373,That’s really shitty.
26374,"&gt;We can encourage them to be vaccinated by requiring vaccine passports to be in buildings open to the public, have employers require employees to be vaccinated, have public schools require students to be vaccinated, and require anyone entering the country to be vaccinated but other than that there isn't much else we can do to coax people to get vaccinated."
26375,Meanwhile you have states like Florida who are currently leading the country in cases passing laws to ban all of those things.
26376,What’s really crazy to me is that colleges are mandating vaccines for staff…but not public elementary or middle schools.
26377,"Full disclosure, I’m a fully vaccinated teacher."
26378,"However, I know many colleagues who did not get the vaccine."
26379,And very soon they’ll be in classrooms with unvaccinated children.
26380,"It's what Republicans do, they govern with their feels."
26381,It's exactly the same thing where I am.
26382,I wouldn’t wait … if anything there would be a booster shot later if needed to re-up your immunity.
26383,"How about helping companies bring more capacity online since if the first world needs boosters, so will the third world?"
26384,"You spent the better part of a year kissing up to China, now go ask for a payoff."
26385,"""they're sick/poor because God is punishing them and that would NEVER happen to me because I'm the christian/cool kid/white"""
26386,Everybody seems to be thinking that the UK is doing better than others countries.

26389,"
&gt;Full vaccination halves the transmission of the Delta variant of coronavirus

Does this mean I can tell those assholes who keep saying it doesn't reduce transmission that they're full of crap?"
26390,debatable given the links to all the evidence that its safe from all the widely recognized authorities on the subject all over this thread.
26391,Sounds like anti vax guy chose yes man doctor
26392,It is true that it is cheaper than PCR testing but generally the advice of mandate is that someone who tests positive on antigen also has to get a PCR test.
26393,That makes the math quite a bit harder.
26394,I think you are looking in the right direction that the total cost (all parties combined) would be cheaper.
26395,"My point was though that those costs are mostly for the people that get sick in the US, while the free tests would get paid for by the government."
26396,In a country with social healthcare the burden is on the people so giving out free tests to lower hospitalizations (which are far more expensive) is a whole different story.
26397,That’s a funny way to say unvaccinated people aren’t taking the pandemic seriously.
26398,"COVID never existed in Florida, why would Delta surprise them?"
26399,"Fair enough, hope things continue in the right direction!"
26400,Let them pay the consequences lul
26401,That has not been my experience.
26402,"If you look at the top comment of any positive news item, it’s always a counter point with a negative slant."
26403,I don't know how health insurance works in the US.
26404,"If you fall ill with something and your insurance company figures out you've been doing off-label use of medicine, can they deny your claim based on that?"
26405, No but I’m in an inpatient healthcare facility amongst some of the most vulnerable people.
26406,I think booster for healthcare workers vaccinated over 6+ months ago should be a priority.
26407,That's literally not a fact
26408,"Actually, there was some flawed data*, and the issue wasn’t that people questioned the data- the issue is Israel never released the studies so experts couldn’t review the data."
26409,Data with zero context to it is pretty much useless.
26410,"On top of that- I always suspected Israel’s data has some merit to it (even if some of it was flawed), and assumed early on, even before they started correlating waning immunity to duration of someone being vaccinated- that antibodies were waning in those who were vaxxed first."
26411,This is because I read an AMA with a seasoned virologist back in May who said this would be the case.

26421,"I can only hope for my local county to do the right thing, or these kids are going to have an awful year full of illness and many schools closing due to teacher shortages."
26422,I had extremely heavy and prolonged bleeding after the vaccine.
26423,A couple of trans men I know have had recurring periods since and mine have been heavier.
26424,"It’s obviously way better than death, but when you’re talking about heavy blood loss and severe dysphoria, it’s worth not being dismissive over, you know?"
26425,Especially if clearing up confusion gets people vaxed.
26426,We have a society where the good of the society is important.
26427,That’s why there are so many early 1900 Supreme Court rulings on vaccine mandates.
26428,"If there was no society or formal framework, your comment holds water."
26429,"However in a public health emergency, which were still in, there’s a different set of circumstances for all citizens/members of the collective society."
26430,That was almost half a year ago
26431,Just being general - I know it's an extreme minority of people who can't get any but I don't know every condition.
26432,You were going to have to retake the vaccine eventually anyway.
26433,"It's all good, I'm lucky to have a good support system and still be able to work."

26435,lol this is what i meant man.
26436,they cant comprehend how the country with fully open economy and no restrictions is ahead (in the sense that they have well passed the peak of the latest wave).
26437,Also we are wide open with a very very transmissible variant.
26438,I mean....FL shut down it's beaches last year.
26439,"No, it's 4.4% of all the positive cases."
26440,"Mosat people I know, including me, had 2 months between shots."
26441,"Fwiw, our school is mandating all students be masked this fall."
26442,I would not send my child to school without a mask; I’m even hesitant enough as it is with the mask mandate.

26445,"(It ain't arbitrary, boss."

26453,"People are given recurrent vaccinations in adulthood, especially to those most at risk of death."
26454,4.
26455,Even those people who don't get recurrent vaccinations have some level of natural immunity from childhood infections.
26456,4.
26457,COVID evolves to become less lethal because less lethality results in less severe lockdowns and allows greater spread of those strains.
26458,"How dishonest you are

&gt;1734 children (588 younger and 1146 older children) had a positive SARS-CoV-2 test result

Valid test is not the same as positive test."
26459,You think we're injecting soldiers today with vaccines because of your predictions of how the world will be in 30 years?
26460,Yup.
26461,It's time to bring the masks back.
26462,I imagine some morons thought the same way about wearing shoes or shirts in public once upon a time.
26463,We need to accept that masks are just going to be a part of our everyday attire.
26464,"I personally wear one at home along with my wife and children as we are back to work, and kids in school."

26477,No.
26478,If they don't want to get vaccinated and don't have a medical exemptions that is their choice.
26479,They'll have to pay for their care though since they are electing to disregard medical advice
26480,India alone may have lost between three to five million so far.
26481,Experts indicate that India's official death toll may be off by ten times.
26482,We hopefully won't reach fifty million but by the time covid becomes more like the flu the worldwide death toll is likely to be in the tens of millions.
26483,Get vaccinated.
26484,Severe cases get pneumonia.
26485,"I assume pneumonia vaccine has no impact, since they work against bacterial and not viral infection."

About three-fourths of people infected in a Massachusetts Covid-19outbreak were fully vaccinated, according to new data published Fridayby the CDC."
26499,"The new data, published in the U.S. agency’s Morbidity andMortality Weekly Report, also found that fully vaccinated people who getinfected carry as much of the virus in their nose as unvaccinatedpeople."

26510,"Assuming everyone in a group is vaccinated and they're not out with the public, I think most people would be willing to take that risk"
26511,"I mean, an increase of 270% sounds horrific right?"
26512,"Yet do you know only 3,200 under 18 hospitalizations have happened in the last 18 months?"
26513,There's 75 million under 18.
26514,So did Arkansas go from 1 to 3?
26515,10 to 30?
26516,100 to 300?
26517,Out of what population?

26606,This is a dangerous lack of knowledge.
26607,This is why they are wanting to lock down vaccinated people too.
26608,"Because so many of them think that they are now immune and they could create a scenario where vaccinated are interacting with unvaccinated high viral load carriers so much that the vaccine fails

Just FYI even vaccinated people are prone to getting sick."
26609,If you are around enough people who are infected it will break through the vaccines protection.
26610,The vaccine significantly lowers your chance of getting sick when you catch it.
26611,It doesn't 100% prevent you from ever catching it and getting sick.
26612,"Yup, clearly an anti-vaxxer in damage control."

26693,"If you want anecdotes, a family member of mine is a pediatrician and I am very aware of how low of a threat this is to kids as a whole."
26694,"FYI - this is an endemic virus, it will continue to mutate no matter what we do, and most will get it eventually."
26695,"So this really doesn't change much

Anti-vaxxers will just say it is rigged"
26696,The studies show it doesn’t reduce RNA levels between vaccinated and unvaccinated people.
26697,Nobody knows if that means that vaccinated people are just as likely to transmit.
26698,"It’s certainly possible, but also possible the same level of RNA in a vaccinated person translates into less infectious virus."
26699,Remember that RNA and infectious virus (the actual meaning of viral load) are not necessarily correlated.
26700,"We have seen some studies looking at breakthrough infections note that the level of RNA in vaccinated people is about the same at peak but antigen tests (which detect the actual virus shell protein) are less likely to be positive, kinda suggesting it could just be remnants of virus for some people."
26701,Either way more work needs to be done.
26702,"CDC doesn’t have time to wait to find out what’s actually going on before they change mask mandates, but scientists absolutely will."
26703,So...you trust the government?
26704,I remember years ago getting claustrophobic when Radiohead headlined Bonnaroo.
26705,"I had many festivals, etc under my belt and still felt like one weird minute could end badly or if i left my friends to use the bathroom, even with spacebaby as a beacon, i would probably not connect with them again until going back to the campsite."
26706,To me now that fear is laughable compared to the threat facing us now.
26707,I dont think i can ever go back to shows and i understand the desire for those who return but we will all pay the price.
26708,[removed]
26709,"For me, it’s concern about exposing friends and family with pre-existin."
26710,"HIV, organ transplant, heart failure, children who can’t be vaccinated yet …

I was so relieved when we got vaccinated that it’s disappointing - but I have run out of sympathy for those who don’t vaccinate or wear masks."
26711,He loves the hate he's getting from the media.
26712,For a movement fueled on owning the l i b s this is perfect for his aspirations.
26713,[removed]
26714,India is also a lot smaller and more densely populated than the US.
26715,"What you said

&gt;74% of new cases in Mass were fully vaccinated

What the study said

&gt;In July 2021, following multiple large public events in a Barnstable County, Massachusetts, town, 469 COVID-19 cases were identified among Massachusetts residents who had traveled to the town during July 3–17; 346 (74%) occurred in fully vaccinated persons."
26716,"The sample did not cover all ""new cases in Massachusetts"" as you implied, but a small, local sample in a single town after several large public events."
26717,"What the authors further point out: 

&gt;data from this report are insufficient to draw 
conclusions about the effectiveness of COVID-19 vaccines 
against SARS-CoV-2, including the Delta variant, during this 
outbreak."
26718,"They're probably going to double down on their holocaust comparisons, now that so many places are requiring proof of vaccination."
26719,"Yeah, I was thinking of this as well."
26720,"Even if the drummer's medical reasons are totally valid and the band understands them, they could be making this decision just because he could not play in venues or countries where vaccination is mandatory to enter."
26721,We already had that.
26722,... no shit
26723,"No, antivirus software"
26724,3 years to come out of the Spanish Flu.
26725,2021 was just season 2.
26726,I'm guessing this is going to be 5 seasons and a movie.
26727,There were surveys around a year ago indicating there would be high vaccine hesitancy.
26728,This shouldn't be a surprise.
26729,Public health community knew this would be a hurdle and hasn't been able to combat this even though they had plenty of time to prepare for it
26730,"Yeah, you work for the government."
26731,That seems about right.
26732,Working for a system that doesn’t demand results like the private sector.
26733,Lol.
26734,If you’re making any decisions then we’re all fucked
26735,"Yep, assuming your doctor decides you need it."
26736,When the random person next to you on the street has found the courage and common sense to care about anything other than their own convenience.
26737,"As we've seen, it's a tenet we pay lip service to but very rarely actually take to heart."
26738,"Thanks for the gilding, someone!"
26739,There was a study posted a few weeks (days?)
26740,ago that a third shot of the regular vaccine provides the same protection as for the original variant .i.e 3 shots Pfizer for Delta = 2 shots for original.
26741,We are literally throwing doses in the garbage.
26742,Let the people intelligent enough to get a booster get one.
26743,"AKA ""Common clay of the new west"""
26744,"Well, it took almost 200 years to eradicate smallpox after the first vaccine was created."
26745,It just seems like this is going to be a never ending chain of events.
26746,Then there will be another variant after that.
26747,Then another.
26748,And another.
26749,That’s what viruses do.
26750,They evolve.
26751,Covid was never going to go away.
26752,Luckily we have tools to make this a much more manageable disease.
26753,I just wish I knew when and what the endgame is and when we shouldn’t be afraid anymore.
26754,What more can we really do about this except protect ourselves?
26755,The CDC study used PCR which only detects viral RNA and is not necessarily correlated with viral load.
26756,They may be looking at actual infections virus.
26757,"wait, what did he do?"
26758,DeSantis is VERY good at playing politician.
26759,He knows exactly how to rile up his base.
26760,"He’s still a POS, but he’s a smart, conniving POS."
26761,"My reaction when cases were plummeting and the CDC loosened up on mask recommendations, ""All the unvaccinated people will be the first to stop wearing masks"""
26762,lol stupid
26763,"this is the Japanese way, for sure, but their govern never gave a shit to actually minimizing spreading lol"
26764,I was responding to someone that is talking about a separate comment I made that was heavily down-voted.
26765,Nobody here is getting upset about down-votes - we are discussing the negative reaction to to that comment and the reasons for it.
26766,Your comment added nothing but noise here.
26767,"The ""dick-nosing"" people look so fucking stupid."
26768,It's good to have a visual indicator of intelligence
26769,"Well then, I guess I shouldn't have stopped getting boosters lol."
26770,Yeah I know his risk for serious issues are low.
26771,I'd still rather he not get sick.
26772,"Every day you stay there, you're making a choice to stay."
26773,This is something that took me a long time to learn.
26774,Put pen to paper and write down the steps you'd have to take to leave your situation.
26775,Write down the pros and cons.
26776,You have to write them down to really work the problem out.
26777,"Then look at the steps, and decide to take them, or not."
26778,[removed]
26779,"No I understand what you said, you wanted Fauci to lie and say get the vaccine and we will all be happy forever."
26780,"Unfortunately just getting the vaccine might not be enough, because the vaccine doesn’t grant us 100% protection."
26781,Iirc lambda is a variant of interest and not a variant of concern
26782,"&gt; COVID can also cause GBS

You don't follow the logic that he already had covid thus obtaining natural immunity and has a very good chance of never ever catching covid again, but if he gets a vaccine he sure as shit 100% getting a vaccine?"
26783,And he ALREADY got GBS from a vaccine as a child that's stayed with him his entire life.
26784,If his doctor recommended not getting vaccinated then that's the personal medical decision and informed consent that everyone's harping on as perfectly fine.
26785,"btw the link between covid and GBS is tenuous, in fact basically zero according to recent large studies."
26786,&gt;you're projecting your own fantasy of personal heroism onto the situation.
26787,Basic hygiene doesn't make me a *hero*.
26788,Jesus Christ.
26789,"I think you might be telling on yourself, here."
26790,"Ok, so the level just got harder and we're not even near this year's end"
26791,"This has nothing to do with what I said, which is that ""we"" (i.e."
26792,"Americans and their polities, whether state or local) aren't instituting mask mandates explicitly in order to protect the children who can't be vaccinated."
26793,I could be wrong!
26794,But your point about the delta variant seems like fearmongering rather than a refutation of what I said.
26795,You seem to think my post has something to do with my own personal habits.
26796,"I can't help but find your condescending ""pray for your kids"" remark to be insulting, frankly."
26797,One year olds don't need to be around a bunch of people to develop socially.
26798,Plenty of kids around that age who had/have a stay at home parent don't play with that many other children/people.
26799,"Honestly, it's easy to say ""it's only 1-2% of kids!"""
26800,when you don't have kids or have never seen your child in the hospital before.
26801,[deleted]
26802,where does that data come from?
26803,worldometer is showing both TN and Missouri still rising on 7 day average
26804,THANK GOD!
26805,As a UNC student i believe this can be one of the ways we make sure everyone stays safe.
26806,And to make sure that low-income students aren't placed in a bind thanks to the hapless university administration.
26807,"It sickens me to know that there ares some students faking vaccination, just so they don't have to be tested weekly when weekly testing literally takes only 10 minutes out of your day and they're in central locations close to classes."
26808,"I seriously hope this goes through because as a disabled student, I need that herd immunity to make sure that students like me are going to stay safe."
26809,UGH this sucks.
26810,Are there actual real world studies (not in a lab) of wearing cloth mask for a day?
26811,CDC advised against wearing masks as a preventative flu measure.
26812,I think from the waves of this pandemic we’ve learned the impact is marginal.
26813,"Unless we believe the peaks and valleys coincide with society embracing masks, then not believing them, then believing again, then not."
26814,I'm glad my neck of the woods has both almost 80% fully vaccinated and 90% of people still wear masks in stores.
26815,The auto mod doesn’t mess around when it comes to anti vaxxers I guess
