0,Technically true but idk this comment feels very cruel.
1,I’ll definitely look it up and I would never just follow something the news or anyone tells me.it just seems weird “ your theory “ because if that’s the case why have presidents been doing it for years.
2,It's already too big.
3,"If you read between the lines, that's what scientists are trying to say."
4,We are very fortunate the vaccines work.
5,They work very well.
6,So much unnecessary death is going to happen.
7,It makes me sad.
8,American here.
9,I totally agree with you.
10,When this pandemic first hit in China I kept trying to explain to those around me that we are hosed if the virus spreads here.
11,People are too stubborn and inconsiderate to do what's right and our government is too broken to organize an effective effort either.
12,I wish I was wrong.
13,I soooo wish I was.
14,"I couldn't fathom THIS bad of a response by Trump, and I didn't expect conservatives to become this illogical, anti-science, or soulless."
15,But I suppose I was being naive.
16,That'd just politicize the vaccine...which we desperately don't need politicized worse than it is  already.
17,"Airplanes have ""rediculously"" good filtration systems, which happen to be exactly what you need to combat the virus."
18,Once the plane's turned off or you're in the airport you may not have that luxury.
19,Universal flu vaccines are tough to make effective because the flu outer coat evolves rapidly and evades the antibodies that your body creates from vaccines (or also from flu sickness).
20,"There are also many different strains and clades of flu, and not every one can be in each annually developed shot."
21,"In contrast, coronaviruses evolve much slower, and Covid-19's spike protein has not been a site of mutation in the strains observed so far."
22,Targeting the spike protein is a great gamble that has paid off for the front runner vaccines.
23,"We'll need updated vaccines down the line, in a few years, but for now these are looking good."
24,[deleted]
25,Yes.
26,"Meanwhile, Australia had 7 cases today."
27,"The film industry is shooting features there that employ a hell of a lot of people, because Californians who complain about lockdowns and wearing masks have perpetuated the virus and made it difficult for the film industry to function without risking another outbreak."
28,"But yeah, let’s blame Newsom for this because he ate out at a fancy restaurant."
29,It’s his fault.
30,Do you think he wanted to do this?
31,Do you think he wanted to lose jobs to Australia?
32,He was faced with terrible options because the citizens of California fucked up.
33,"Meanwhile, Australia had 7 covid cases today."
34,"If you want a depressing example, look at the abandonment of Reconstruction."
35,Over 150 years later and we still haven't recaptured all the progress that was destroyed.
36,"He's going to anyway, most of us won't care and know it's bullshit, 30% will call it the ""Trump Vaccine""....literally what they're calling it."
37,"Look it up yourself or you're just gonna follow other blind people

As a blind person: EOs still have to work within the executive branches legal boundaries

A president isn't a king so they can't just say:""Do this because I'm the president"""
38,If a state gets like this why don’t they do a complete shut down?
39,Doesn’t that power reside with the state?
40,Don't be so sure.
41,I've seen bunch of young people wearing masks celebrating Biden's victory.
42,"Until, they started taking off their masks to share a bottle of champagne....

45,"An employer is not allowed to fire you based on your religious belief, but is allowed to take the employees that aren’t vaccinated and fire only a portion of them based on their religious beliefs (because some of them are exempt based on their religious belief)."
46,I fail to understand how that is not discrimination based on religious belief?

I work in a plant with over 5,000 workers."
51,We haven't had a single person die in the 10 months of this nonsense.
52,"We had a guy in my department who is diabetic, has heart failure, smokes, drinks and only has one operational lung go out for actually contracting COVID and the worst that happened to him was a fever."
53,He was back at work in a week.
54,"Those will people will be too weak or dead to protest, sorry to say."
55,And what would they even protest?
56,You protest to get an alternative political plan in place.
57,There is no alternative right now.
58,If you cant get treated you will just not get treated.
59,A protest wont change that.
60,I know people who have had it and were fine.
61,I also know several that have died (one in her mid 30s).
62,Yours and my personal experiences are anecdotal and shouldn’t be used to draw conclusions.
63,The reality is COVID is killing a lot of people.
64,"Yeah, most of them are old."
65,But young people aren’t 100% unaffected and are carriers to the vulnerable.
66,Bottom line - take the vaccine.
67,"If not for you then your parents, grandparents or elderly neighbor."
68,And that's a HUGE assumption.
69,I have no clue what you're basing your assumption off of.
70,Did you make it up?
71,Who knows?
72,That's kind of a dick thing to say.
73,81 million people voted his ass out because amongst many things his botched covid response.
74,"Many of us are trying to do the right thing and essentially you're saying because one asshole fucked up, the people should suffer."
75,I don't think you'd like if someone made that comment about your country if your leader fumbled the response so bad.
76,There's no lol to be had.
77,"285,000 people here in America are dead."
78,My last was a big Korean bbq meal in a loud and crowded place.

110,Originally had planned to be married this past May then was able to reschedule to August at which point we tried to push it out to 2021 or beyond and they refused to reschedule without us paying for the venue a second time.
111,What a joke.
112,"It's also the fault of the government for saying that weddings are safe and allowed and not forcing them to shut down and help them survive the pandemic, but whatever."
113,"So yeah, in short, we cancelled and lost all of our venue money (thankfully other vendors let us cancel)."
114,I'm sorry you are going through the same thing.
115,"Best of luck to you, I know it sucks."
116,"We had to try to write some legalese letters to the venue and some vendors in order to try to get some money back, maybe you could try something similar?"
117,Australia will be providing vaccines to Pacific nations.
118,Is that also 'vaccine diplomacy'?
119,I bet you won't see it mentioned as such.

124,Relax
125,God for the sake of the rest of the world I hope so.
126,"I also think we need an official system because people are already buying fake covid test results, I Have no doubt they will buy fake vaccine paperwork too."
127,Americans took it up among ourselves by voting out the leader who failed us.
128,"The good news is that we still secured more doses with Moderna so the sick, fragile, and elderly that are dying here can get vaccinated first soon."
129,Don't forget that we also have flu shots.
130,Makes sense.

142,Lmao you're getting exactly $0 from someone working in a nursing home.
143,I doubt they even bother suing her.
144,The home should have been rapid testing their employees everyday.
145,They should have paid hazard pay.
146,I don't feel that salty at all towards the employees.
147,Why the fuck should they isolate when they get paid nothing and still risk Covid everyday they go to work?
148,My friend works at a nursing home.
149,She got Covid.
150,No time off.
151,Just told to come in and work with residents that have Covid.
152,Fuck anyone who owns a nursing home and charges thousands a month only to pay primary caregivers pennies.

156,"Thank you, that makes me feel much better."
157,"I mean I would do that but I’d still be going to work for the week before Christmas, I mean I could catch it then and then not test positive yet"
158,Nurses and EMTs have among them some fraction that really ought to know better.
159,"They basically think they're experts, but don't know enough to realize that they're not."
160,"Personally I wouldn't report such a person for this level of personal indiscretion (being anti-mask, going to bars, etc) and doing shit that a lot of idiots are doing while not working."
161,I would only report someone for a direct transgression that really puts their patients at risk (e.g.
162,"working while Covid positive, or actively harming patients, etc)."
163,Plenty of evidence.
164,Well just have to wait and see :)
165,[deleted]
166,In terms of covid it absolutely is a lost cause.
167,This shit is basically baked in now with people who are now sick and were spreading it for the past few weeks and also those who have basically decided they are done with restrictions and will do whatever the fuck they want.
168,It seems the worse things get the less people care.
169,This will just burn out naturally like other pandemics but tragically it will happen just as the vaccine will be rolling out.
170,Many people are going to die simply because they couldn't just wait another few months.
171,All I can say is that I hope Thanksgiving and Christmas are worth what will be coming.
172,Academics will be studying the psychology and sociology of this for decades to come.
173,Bonafide masks
174,Yeah you can?
175,Youre kidding me saying that lol making it sound like you and you’re family are  the only one that’s has to make sacrifices.
176,Plenty of people are doing exactly what you say you can’t do to them because they have enough decency to look out for your health while you disregard ours
177,Anecdotes are meaningless.
178,What I do care about though are peer reviewed studies that suggest PCR tests don't work.
179,Care to present some?
180,"Ironically, the paper that won the very court battle that you've presented suggested that Ct values under 30 during the first week of infection (during when people are at their most infectious) are extremely likely to be true positives."
181,That's a testament to the strength of the PCR test.
182,"Quite far from it being ""notoriously unreliable"", don't you say?"
183,"Lastly, deaths are what the ""doom train"" runs on."
184,"The number of positive tests however do for whatever reason, trend quite strongly with the death curve though."
185,Strange for a test that supposedly doesn't work.
186,The takeaway is that the pandemic is largely composed of propaganda.
187,Get a test then go
188,[deleted]
189,Probably why I can sit on a crowded plane and eat and drink from the little baggie of good they gave me and not be at risk..
190,But when that plane lands we should disembark slowly as to make space for social distancing.. Rediculous
191,There are people posting opinions about various topics.
192,"If I want to post thoughts on a topic which might counter other opinions, then a journal article can be a resource to backup my opinion."
193,Your response though seems to indicate this is not the place to post any scientific articles (which by the way many have been posted by users in this thread).
194,I will not post any journal articles here.
195,"Here is a press release from Pfizer discussing the use and promising preliminary results of a two dose schedule from August 20, 2020."
196,"[link](https://www.pfizer.com/news/press-release/press-release-detail/pfizer-and-biontech-share-positive-early-data-lead-mrna)

It was definitely known and the moderna vaccine   (Which the US should have been more informed about) would have probably been looking at 2 doses in their trials at that time as well."
197,That alone should have been enough alert US health officials.
198,Sometimes these forums are exactly the best place.
199,"Try and focus on what you can do, what can distract you in a positive way too."
200,"when my dad was dying I read a lot of books, and tried to meditate and do some yoga."
201,"Maybe there’s things that you can do to make things easier for your family- order dinners, send supplies, stay in contact and try rest."
202,Take care.
203,My thoughts are with you and your family.
204,&gt; So why not put down a billion or two to get a hold of their vaccines?
205,"They did, that's why people are getting vaccinated at the end of the week, probably."
206,"Ah yes, throwing people into prison with no evidence."
207,Hopefully someone accuses you of infecting them as well so you can join them.
208,Double standards are out of control.
209,We need leadership that follows their own rules.

238,About time we ask what our country can do for us for a change.
239,The fuck do we even pay taxes for if we feel guilty about receiving assistance?
240,You’ve been gaslighted by a degenerate society.
241,Do not listen to that guilt for even a second.
242,It is not you.
243,It’s decades of neoliberal propaganda talking.
244,"I doubt any society that has done well, will allow in un-vaccinated arrivals."

247,How is their records with Muslims?
248,"Right, but don’t lump us all together."
249,"I haven’t been in a restaurant since March, or seen family in person since February."
250,Some of us are not selfish and it’s just as shitty to act like we’re part of the irresponsible majority.
251,"Please don’t put “suffering” in quotes, that’s disgusting."
252,That's talking about everyone getting the second shot.
253,"After the first shot, though, there's 50% immunity."
254,"So it's a slow rise to every healthcare worker having ""full"" immunity."
255,We all knew this.
256,Not even one person will be fully vaccinated until like five weeks after the very first shot.
257,"Not sure if this is answerable but i want to go over to my friends house (we would both be wearing masks indoors) to watch a movie, but they told me their upstairs neighbor is quarantined because they were exposed to covid (no symptoms)."
258,Would it be possible for covid to travel through the air ducts?
259,canada has closed its land border with the US for months now.
260,the land border doesn't explain why cases are going up across nearly every province in the last 4-5 weeks.

264,"Believe me, doctor."
265,There are a lot of of us who have been disappointed and completely caught off guard about a lot of things this year.
266,"&gt; but its such a Redditor response to definitively judge something they very clearly have no experience in lmao

Uh, I got married ten years ago."
267,&gt; Its not as simple as “having a smaller wedding” or “just fucking waiting”because youre out thousands and thousands of dollars.
268,"Yes, it is that simple."
269,"Any venue would be crazy not to have a refund policy under Covid, but even if they don't, being out a few thousand dollars is better than being out a few relatives."
270,The people planning weddings numbering in the hundreds can sure as hell afford to lose a little money if it comes to that.

288,"&gt;Because it takes two shots to get the full vaccine, 100 million doses will only protect 50 million humans."
289,There are over 330 million Americans.
290,"This is assuming perfect use, which isn't gonna happen."
291,"Some people will forget to get the 2nd shot and will have to start over, some nurses/doctors will miss the injection spot so they'll have to toss the needle and get a new one, some doses will have to get tossed because they were taken out of the freezer slightly too early or the freezer broke down and they went bad, etc."

319,"For example, Italy's first super spreader was believed to be from a German business man who picked it up in Wuhan and spread it in Italy."
320,One of France and UK's first super spreader was by a businessman who picked it up in Singapore and went to a ski resort in France then went home to the UK.
321,"I guess you could call them ""rich"" but a lot of other super spreaders were just middle class people."

351,If you want to counter that point I would love to have that discussion but I am not going to defend arguments you invented and then tried to credit me with making.
352,And the continuing acidification of the ocean and global overfishing is killing these economies regardless.

356,Cost?
357,"Rice and beans and fruit and vegetables are all cheaper per unit price than meat is, and almost the entire world uses those as the basis of their cuisine."

359,What other definition are you using?
360,"Okay, let's not pretend that Oxford wasn't Reddit's favorite earlier in the pandemic."

369,"In theory, if you have extra risks or fall into a group that the vaccine isn’t approved for, it should be relatively easy to get an exemption and you’re protected by herd immunity, if &gt;70% of your coworkers get vaccinated."
370,This has only begun to break down in recent years due to the anti-vax movement.
371,They’ll likely require you to wear a mask full time until you do get the vaccine but otherwise I wouldn’t worry.
372,Considering it's worse here.........

You have zero evidence for that statement."

382,The median time spent in a nursing home for men is THREE MONTHS.
383,The title really confused me.
384,"For a cybersecurity chief, shouldn't IP mean IP address?"

404,You’re also misrepresenting what I’ve suggested.
405,Of course 100% of all illnesses and deaths won’t be prevented.
406,To suggest that we therefore have no standards at all is categorically ridiculous.
407,You might as well suggest we decriminalize drunk driving because outlawing it hasn’t prevented 100% of all road deaths.
408,I’m not suggesting that these people be charged because people died.
409,"I’m suggesting they should be charged because people died *due to their flagrant, callous, and unconscionable negligence*."
410,"They acted with complete and utter disregard for the welfare of their vulnerable patients, for whom they had a clear and very, very simple duty of care."
411,"Had they behaved in a manner that was remotely mature or responsible, and people had nevertheless died, that would be different."
412,"But they decided, “screw the patients, I want to get dressed up and let it all hang out”."
413,Suggesting that manslaughter charges are in any way excessive is honestly ridiculous.

424,"We will hit 50% without a problem, the other 20% will take few years"
425,Can't herd immunity work at a regional level?
426,"For example, a region of the US has a high adoption rate, and reach herd immunity, but a some other region many miles away has a low adoption rate and the virus is still circulating throughout the communities."
427,"I vaguely remember reading something about regional immunity, but I can't find the article now."
428,They talked about areas of NYC where children weren't being  vaccinated vs. other communities where there were fewer anti-vax parents.
429,&gt; Meanwhile our governor is at the countries finest restaurant without a care for his people.
430,When he went back on his word a (before covid) to make vaccine exemptions harder to get because of political pressure from anti-vax groups I knew he was just a piece of shit politician.
431,I hope this helps sink any presidential run he's (definitely) thinking of going for.
432,This guy clearly is latching onto something with having actually thought it through.
433,"All tests have a margin of error and no GP diagnoses without clinical symptoms,  etc."
434,The test could be 50%accurate and it doesn't matter.
435,"What matters is rate of increase of cases, hospitalization and deaths."
436,All of which are very very obviously going up across the board.
437,And even if you somehow are too dense to see that take one second and look at excess death curves in the US.
438,This is the most basic s*** if you actually have a brain.
439,"I'm sick of these half hashed ""what if"" twats trying to act like they even know a fraction of what they're talking about."

516,Fine thing to work towards but also difficult.
517,Looks like you made a post about taxing larger landlords more.. does that even further your goal?
518,The vaccine is very optimistic but it’s going to take a few more months before we start to see the fruition in terms of lower cases/hospitalizations from the first doses.
519,requires two doses about a month apart so even if you get your first dose in mid December you aren’t guaranteed a strong immune response for 1-2 months after that which is around February.

552,It isn’t even *close* to blanket immunity.
553,"Second, that’s not why congress passed the legislation in the 90s."
554,It was because conspiracy theorists were alleging anything bad that happened even remotely close in time to receiving a vaccine was the fault of the vaccine manufacturer.
555,And it’s impossible to prove a negative - how can a vaccine manufacturer prove their vaccine *didn’t* cause X.
556,They can’t.
557,The law is just a safe harbor that basically says as long as they follow the rules set forth by the FDA they can’t be held liable.
558,It’s the equivalent of the government passing a law declaring cellphone companies can’t be held liable for any alleged damages caused by 5G so long as they only put up FCC approved cellphone towers.

574,They’ve already shipped to UK and Other countries that approved Pfizer’s vaccine.
575,And they said in late November they were projecting 100 million by end of year and that’s been cut to 50 million target due to problems with raw materials.

653,Now that this scandal is six months old or so... is there a good analysis of her data vs. the official Florida data?
654,Is she showing more deaths?
655,"Gimme that shit, I want it now"
656,DeSantis now has a Gestapo.
657,Let that sink in.
658,These guys think that suspending the intellectual property rights surrounding the vaccines will increase production and availability.
659,The profit motive works in the opposite direction to keep the product scarce and the price high.

666,"Let me get this straight: Because the US hasn't purchased enough vaccine doses for Americans, it needs to give Africa/Latin America first dibs on some of the doses it has purchased."
667,"Refusing to provide foreign aid would be bullying and uncivil, even if the cost is to prolong the pandemic in the US."
668,"Australia (or other countries unaffected by this action) will be so moved by it that they'll give a bunch of doses to the US, instead of vaccinating either their own people or the global poor."
669,I wouldn't hold my breath.
670,The food bank has nothing to do with the government.
671,The food bank takes donations from the citizens.
672,Never think that the government is here to help you.
673,We're here for each other.
674,It’s probably going to last until April.
675,Under what conditions does anyone think otherwise?
676,This is 100% on the shoulders of the GOP Senate.
677,Support of any kind for the national GOP is de facto support for death and economic devastation.

681,Lol.
682,Get to the back of the line
683,Ok.
684,Thank you.
685,"Ik this is one of them, but I was just wondering if it would delay widespread availability a couple of months down the road, since people expect that to be April, but I was worried this would delay that."
686,I'm really not scared of it either.
687,But this is a fear echo chamber in here.
688,"Umm, we will be getting 100 million from Pfizer 100 million from Moderna, 300 million from Oxford, and then several hundred million more from J&amp;J and other ones."
689,"Word, I get TERRIBLE munchies 100% of the time."
690,Haven't found that magical strain that doesn't make you want to eat 3 times more dinner than you would sober.
691,We bought 100 million doses from Pfizer already.
692,"When people come home from vacation in Florida, those new positive cases aren't counted towards Florida's numbers."
693,I understand we don't contract trace and that isn't how cases are tracked.
694,"However, I live in Key West and know of 10+ cases of people returning home from vacation and testing positive."
695,Not the same thing.
696,That was the government taking over factories and the full cost of production.
697,It's going to be a bit different with something as sensitive as a vaccine involved

712,"When you mentioned ""game theory"" I thought you were going to argue that the possibility of a $1500 incentive could lead to a moral hazard, which is possible."
713,"If there's discussion that there ""may"" be an incentive and it takes a long time to debate in government and get passed, people who might have thought of getting the vaccine right away may be incentivized to wait on it, which would not be a great side effect."
714,I suppose you could weigh the number of people you could incentive with $1500 vs. the ones you could put off with it and pick the one more likely to have better net effect.

747,Spring was when it was estimated anybody could get vaccinated

750,Yes.

768,Should be fine with J&amp;J and AstraZeneca once they redo their trials.
769,What do you mean when you say 'his base'?
770,Are you referring to all 70 million people who voted for Trump?
771,GHB is a good time though.
772,do we have any knowledge on if this severity of the fever is common?
773,"I was listening to a podcast where another member of a clinical trial had pretty much all of these symptoms, but he was administered a dose stronger than the one being rolled out."
774,I'm pretty sure that everybody given the lower-level dose (the vaccines being distributed to the public) did not have these extreme fevers.
775,Hopefully this lady had a dose stronger than the vaccine being rolled out.
776,"Also, Unfortunately, I can't remember which vaccine the podcast was referring to."
777,I think it was on five thirty eight though for anybody who is curious.
778,"I am totally on board for the vaccine regardless, but hearing news of a nearly 105 degree fever is definitely concerning coming from someone who can't recall having a fever above 102."
779,"The US ordered a specific amount of doses from Pfizer, who produces the Germany-based, BioNTech-made vaccine."
780,They were offered an option of increasing their ordered but declined.
781,The US isn't entitled to these doses over the other countries that ordered them.
782,"It's not a case of ""we shouldn't give away our doses"", but rather ""we never had these doses in the first place, because our administration is that incompetent""."
783,"Bet you whatever they got, was in the water."

789,Sure they screwed up.
790,But it generated interesting numbers and the scale was big enough to make some preliminary inferences.
791,"I think this technology existed a few years before the pandemic hit, it just never had the funding and testing to make it a reality until now."
792,Apparently you love dying of ignorance
793,Like my work.
794,Little do they know their recklessness has led to me looking for another job.
795,"I'm still there, until I'm hired at another place that CARES about human life."
796,"That's true, but it won't solve the issue of curving the spread."
797,We have a limited number of vaccines.
798,It would be better to vaccinate those who will spread it further right away.
799,"Healthcare workers, Frontline workers, Factory workers."
800,"If you vaccinate these groups it'll curve the virus, keep the economy afloat."
801,"If we vaccinate everyone who is 70+ now it won't curve the virus, the younger generations are those on the frontline spreading it to begin with."
802,"It's more likely those who are 70+ are retired staying at home, or in nursing homes."
803,"( If you vaccinate the healthcare workers in nursing homes it wouldn't get into these nursing homes to begin with, which means you wouldn't need to vaccinate the elderly inside these facilities)."
804,"&amp;#x200B;

Honestly just seems like a bad way to go about it."
805,It's highly unlikely this 90 year old is face to face with hundreds of people daily like some 18 year old frontline workers in grocery stores.
806,"&amp;#x200B;

Winter is just starting, the virus will explode, there won't be enough vaccines for everyone till mid 2021."
807,Curving it now is more important than protecting those who are staying indoors and 90+ years old.
808,"&amp;#x200B;

Just my opinion, feel free to give a viewpoint on it."

813,"A small light, finally, at the end of the longest tunnel in the known universe."
814,Yes!
815,So exciting.
816,The beginning of the end is truly here.
817,"If you think feeling like shit for 12 hours is bad, wait until you catch COVID-19 and feel like shit for 240 hours."
818,The US Pfizer plant currently has quality issues...so it’s all coming from Belgium
819,Wait until a few studies come up in a year or two with a sound basis to revise significantly upward in many countries.
820,Now we just need to not get the 'vid for a little while longer.
821,Almost there
822,I’m trying to get in the small arm now.

830,We can keep covid from killing hundreds of thousands of Americans.
831,Maybe the government could buy the vaccine?
832,I like how it’s a wee old random granny getting it rather than someone famous.
833,And that was before COVID19.
834,FDA is meeting about the Pfizer vaccine on Dec 10th (Thursday) and the Moderna vaccine on Dec 17th -- almost there!
835,In the US companies requiring that will be challenged legally.
836,We don’t currently require vaccines for measles or the flu so either we will have to (unlikely) or companies will have to be equally lax about covid.
837,It really is the fat Walmart shopper with all the toilet rolls of the world.
838,Eh fuck landlords
839,Same.
840,They’re enrolling the small arm in the USA.

870,"There were a few cases of people that got welded or chained into their homes, these people were constant quarantine breakers."
871,"Frankly in my opinion, fuck them assholes."
872,In many countries these people were put into prison so i guess being stuck at home wasn't so bad.
873,"But again this wasn't done by the government, just community leaders."
874,In fact when officials found out they were ordered to unlock said doors and those that organized it were reprimanded.
875,Objective one is to protect the health system.
876,You do this in two ways : immunise healthcare workers and those most likely to end up in hospital it infected.
877,5m is very promising.

900,idk.
901,I'd be lying if I said I knew what the administration is thinking.
902,"It ultimately doesn't matter, as Oxford's candidate will likely be approved eventually as well."
903,"Oh, sounds like a communist socialist hell hole."
904,Did Marx say competent ppl are good?
905,Presuming he's not in a priority group like healthcare workers (21 million) or a nursing home resident (3 million) he's not going to be able to get it until all of those people are vaccinated ahead of him anyway.
906,Then it's 87 million people classed as essential workers.
907,"Projections are that healthy adults under 65 who are not healthcare or essential workers aren't going to be able to get this until next May or June, even it they wanted to."
908,"So even if he was chomping at the bit to get this, and qualified as an essential worker, he'd be realistically looking at in the region of 24 million people getting this before him."
909,"And very possibly, if he's not an essential worker, over 100 million people getting it before him, and at least 6-7 months before he can get it."
910,Plenty of time to see what happens.
911,[removed]
912,"I think the 4m are Pfizer, yes."
913,Although there is hope the Oxford vaccine could also be approved by the end of the year.
914,"Yes Margaret, didn’t even feel it."
915,Legend.
916,The noting of epigenetic manipulation is interesting.
917,You made me think of a Star Trek TOS episode where Kirk comes across a civilization that forgot how their tech worked because it had been centuries since the designers were alive haha
918,"That has been speculated, but they are running a US trial with the original dosing, and a lot will depend on the readout from that."
919,"As long as that's solid, it will most likely be approved at that dosing in the US and I'd guess EU will follow."
920,"The new trial will be about the new, potentially more effective dosing regime."
921,"No, we didn't."
922,"I made a complaint to the hospital, but they didn't seem too concerned about it."
923,I’ve had the same thoughts too.
924,If we can vaccinate the carriers maybe that would be a better idea?
925,"But I came to the conclusion that the people in charge of this whole rollout have obviously thought of the same thing and chose to go this route, so I’m going to assume they know better than I do about who should get it first."
926,The purpose of US news is not to tell the news; it is to generate viewers and advertising revenue.
927,Telling the truth as it is is how you end up losing viewers.
928,Your typical American had not developed the full mental capacity for that.
929,They would immediately switch channels or turn on Netflix or YT.
930,Only in California.
931,You re right.
932,If number are not dropping anymore it is for a reason
933,There was no need to pick a specific horse though.
934,Like literally just pick all of them.
935,The cost is negligible compared to what the effects are.
936,Again there are other candidates.
937,And we have a new president in 40 days.
938,"We will start mass vaccinations around second/third quarter of 2021, and I would rather believe the numerous experts who say that over you."
939,"Astra Zeneca itself has a history of bribery, and it happened at exactly the same time as Kangtai (2016)."

So why did they not talk about Astra Zeneca also being problematic with its bribery?"
941,Right.
942,"Obviously it would be great if we had more or if Oxford was going to be approved tomorrow, but what can you do"
943,Pressing red button in nuclear missile launch facility?

979,Innocent Iranians will die if they don’t have access to this vaccine.
980,It should be a human right.
981,You don’t judge a whole country of people by their government and I can tell you the majority of the Iranian public hate what their country has become and want a change of power.
982,If you think a bunch of innocent people don’t deserve a vaccine because “their country have their own scientists so should have made them themselves!
983,"!” then fuck you, bet your opinion would be different if one of them was your grandfather"
984,Well I meant Ewa Stenbergs commentary that was published by [DN](https://www.dn.se/sverige/ewa-stenberg-nu-skalver-den-svenska-coronastrategin/) on November 13.
985,Closing secondary schools was done in the spring as well so it’s completely in line with FHM thinking.

988,"By the way, did you notice in the November 26 press conference that it included Johan Carlson (Director General) and Karin Tegmark Wisell from FHM?"

They've already done it in the UK."
991,"Trouble is the FDA, they don't like data from other countries."
992,Good news is that at this rate Oxford/AZ should be completing its American study soon.
993,And my hope is the FDA doesn't have their head stuck so far up their ass that they refuse to accept any data from Oxford because Moderna's and Pfizer's candidates work
994,Let's hope everything will be alright

1000,Are those 4m all expected to be Biontech/Pfizer vaccines?
1001,And are there numbers for Q1 2021 already regarding Biontech/Pfizer?
1002,I'm just confused since Merkel said she expects only 7m doses from Biontech/Pfizer + Moderna (combined) by Q1 2021.
1003,And Pfizer said they plan to distribute their vaccines fairly based on population numbers.
1004,These statements would only make sense if 4m doses (or a bit more) is all the UK can expect in 2020 plus Q1 2021.
1005,Or maybe Merkel got the numbers or dates wrong.
1006,I'm confused.
1007,I get that but it's more likely someone who is young will be more likely to spread around the virus to begin with (Frontline worker/College) vs a 90 year old lady.
1008,"Then you have lifelong complications of the virus, which would effect the 18 year old for decades to come vs the 90 year old likely has less than 5-10 years realistically."
1009,True.

1064,"quote:

&gt;The potential consequences for rural America can be seen in flu data."
1065,Historic data from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Wonder database show that the flu virus tends to kill at higher rates in more rural counties.
1066,"&gt;Experts say if COVID-19 vaccination follows the same pattern as the flu, the flow of people between these communities and the rest of the country will put both city dwellers and rural residents at risk."
1067,"&gt;Flu vaccination has largely skipped much of rural America because, in part, it’s harder for people in remote communities to get to pharmacies, clinics or hospitals offering vaccines."
1068,There’s also a longstanding distrust in the medical system in these areas.
1069,"Yet getting the COVID-19 vaccine to these areas will be key to tamping down a virus that’s ravaged rural communities, experts said."
1070,"&gt;“Ensuring vaccine coverage of rural communities is an essential part of the strategy to protect rural communities from COVID-19,” Dr. Thomas Tsai, a surgeon and health policy researcher at Harvard's T.H."
1071,"Chan School of Public Health, said in an email."
1072,"&gt;**Herd immunity**

&gt;Researchers don’t know how much of the U.S. population will need to be protected to stop the spread of COVID-19."
1073,"Estimates range from 50% to as high as 90% of the population to achieve a threshold epidemiologists describe as “herd immunity.”

&gt;Reaching that threshold will be a struggle, if the flu vaccine is any indication."
1074,"Only half the country gets vaccinated for the flu, on average, and surveys show a growing number of people intend to refuse a COVID-19 vaccine."
1075,"Achieving a much higher vaccination rate with the COVID-19 vaccine will be the difference between a coronavirus that’s endemic and actively circulating and a coronavirus that’s all but wiped out, a goal the nation has attained with the smallpox, mumps and diphtheria viruses."
1076,As the vaccine comes out here's the question no one wants to think about.
1077,What happens when this happens again in a few years?
1078,For me it's hard to get excited about a vaccine when such a dangerous precedent has been set.
1079,"I'm not an anti-vaxxer or Covid denier, but I don't think there should have ever been shutdowns."
1080,"Those who are 65 and older and those with certain health conditions should've stayed home, the rest of the country should've largely maintained normal life with masks and physical distancing."
1081,The precedent has now been set.
1082,"Anytime there's a new virus that kills people that we don't understand, shut everything down until there's a vaccine."
1083,So what happens in a couple years when we get Covid-22 or Covid-23?
1084,Don't think for a second that countries not friendly to the U.S. haven't seen that this virus has brought the country to its knees.
1085,"I guarantee you China, Russia, North Korea and Venezuela are all in a mad rush right now to develop the next deadly virus that they can release on the U.S."
1086,There will be another one of these viruses within the next 5 years.
1087,Do we shut down everything again?
1088,Will we have to accept life where every few years we shut down due to a new virus?
1089,What if the next virus they can't generate a vaccine so quickly?
1090,What if a vaccine for the next virus takes years to develop?
1091,Do we shut down for years?
1092,Remember after the measles outbreak kids in NY had to be vaccinated to go to school?

&gt;if we know that then that is a great starting point for putting more funding into finding solutions for that particular ethnic group."
1206,"Wait so, we shouldn't be including them in your class of  Vulnerable  people that should be Isolated for their own safety?"
1207,Does funding work when the Sturgis  Crowd rides through indigenous  Lands despite the risk that it poses to indigenous populations?
1208,&gt;Don’t you think?

1210,Do you wanna talk about how people who are vulnerable and in poverty are being forced into dangerous  Working environments While States provide corporate immunity to prevent retaliation of employees being put into dangerous work environments?
1211,&gt;Instead of locking down everyone can’t we have more targeted solutions based on your risk factors for requiring hospitalization?
1212,"I don't know where you're living, but not everybody is ""locked down"" where I am."

1282,It's also weird that we're at the point where we're assessing photos of a 47 year old to see if we can justify the fact that she died in a way that makes it seem less scary.
1283,😕
1284,Not that I have heard.
1285,It should be noted that they have several different ones being developed.
1286,"The one I have heard the most about is your basic ""low tech"" vaccine."
1287,"Get some virus, kill/weaken it, and inject it."
1288,"One thing I do remember is that they had the head of the vaccine development group be one of the first ""test subjects""."
1289,"They don't have Phase 3 data yet, we'll get there."
1290,Me and wife had flu jabs in October at our GP surgery.
1291,I was impressed with their organisation.
1292,It was almost agricultural.
1293,"I will explain:

1."
1294,Received letter specifying exact time and date.
1295,2.
1296,Told to arrive no later than 10 minutes beforehand and wait in car.
1297,3.
1298,Enter surgery as directed by surgery staff where there was a one way system in place.
1299,4.
1300,All surgery staff in full PPE.
1301,Patients with masks.
1302,5.
1303,No waiting and directed to doctors office.
1304,6 offices available with either doctor or nurse in full PPE.
1305,6.
1306,Handover letter and get jab.
1307,7.
1308,Exit surgery via emergency exit at back.
1309,8.
1310,Back to car and away.
1311,9.
1312,Approximately 3 minutes from start to finish.
1313,"So assuming say 4 minutes per patient my surgery can do 90 patients an hour, so 900 over a 10 hour day."
1314,A quick Google says a GP has on average 2000 patients.
1315,"So with 6 doctors in our surgery gives a total of 12,000 patients."
1316,They could all be vaccinated in less than 15 days.
1317,You perform surgeries at pharmacies?!?
1318,?
1319,"Oh well, we need to sit on Santa's lap and breath in his essence"
1320,It's not that the trial was necessarily messed up It's that there's a question on whether it can be more effective than what was initially found.
1321,I think they found It's 62% effective with 2 full doses which is more than the 50% requirement that the FDA had.
1322,But they also found with a half dose it can be 90% effective so they're just wanting to confirm whether this is the case or not which if is would be brilliant news for us.
1323,But even with the 62% effective sure it's not as good as pfizer/moderna but it still meets the 50% FDA requirement.
1324,And flu vaccines are only 40-60%
1325,I had a mild headache and woke up with a sweaty pillow from the Pfizer vaccine.
1326,A++ would donate my body to science to kill this pandemic again.
1327,I'll see ya in 60 days.
1328,Thank the gods it wasn't the queen.
1329,Imagine how tone deaf that would be.
1330,If there already podded up then go for it.
1331,"But ffs, I get the heebee jeebies just thinking about being in the same room with single other non current household person, let alone ten others."
1332,The Chinese vaccine was deployed before they even knew how well it worked.
1333,That would be a HUGE no in the US or the Western world in general.
1334,"As much as people don’t want to admit it, the UK sped up their approval because of Brexit."
1335,Do I think they rushed it?
1336,No.
1337,The US is taking its time because vaccine hesitancy is high and they need to try and build trust by showing a proper review.
1338,No I didn’t say they should suffer but it’s not the schools faults.
1339,Her name is Margaret Keenan.
1340,"Remember her name, it'll be the answer to questions in pub quizes over the next years."

1348,I skipped Thanksgiving it was the first non-stressful holiday I've ever had
1349,We will have a better understanding of it's effectiveness by the time it becomes available to the general public.
1350,I'm optimistic we can get a majority of citizens to take it but I'm not sure what happens when 30-40% refuse to take it.
1351,I know that doesn't give us herd immunity but I don't have a clue how that scenario plays out.
1352,Would that mean the vaccinated are safe and the disease gets passed back and forth amongst the unvaccinated and the immunocompromised?
1353,Or would the virus get passed around until it starts jumping back into the vaccinated population?
1354,"Can confirm

Queue jumping is considered worse than killing someone's first born child"
1355,Moderna is and has been focused exclusively on pharmaceutical applications of mRNA.
1356,It’s their core competency - it would be weird of them to do anything else.
1357,Canada has enough for 10x over but we wont be getting most of it for a while.
1358,And the extras will be send to 3rd world countries who can't afford obtaining vaccines.
1359,"Serious question: if both people are masked and hold their breath, can they safely hug for a minute?"
1360,Is there any truth 2 her allegations?
1361,Or it all hersay
1362,I am in America and we are getting ours before December ends.
1363,Old people and health workers first.
1364,What an age to live in.
1365,Is it?
1366,I’m not going back to normal until I’m vaccinated or community spread is gone.
1367,Just because you don’t die doesn’t mean you didn’t pick up a new lifelong ailment or a year without smell/taste.
1368,I think this Friday they should get the approval and then 24 hours after that the first doses should arrive and be given
1369,Giving it to those who work in the hospitals first is a smart move.
1370,I didn't even think of how obvious that is
1371,Is that why it tastes like Faygo?

1393,[removed]
1394,The FDA is likely to approve the Pfizer vaccine within a week or so.
1395,Vaccinations should start soon after that (within a few days).
1396,So in theory the first vaccinations in the US could happen this weekend or early next week.
1397,What do you mean?
1398,He threatened a few weeks ago to sue for equitable distribution of the vaccine.
1399,That has nothing to do with this article.
1400,They specified it's the seroconversion rate.
1401,Efficacy results from the Brazilian trials should come out soon.
1402,I have a suspicion it takes a few generations of spread before you see that bump.
1403,"Let's say you have 1000 people, and 5 of them have a dinner party and get infected."
1404,That's not going to bump the needle much.
1405,"But let's set r at 2, meaning those 5 become 10 after five days."
1406,"Then 20 five days after that, then 40, 80, 160, 320."
1407,"It's now a month later and you have a real surge stemming from that initial, hard to notice spike."
1408,But it didn't become a problem until you let it run for a while.
1409,"A few extra infections spread out across the population and allowed to spread without a lot of checks for a month could see the situation looking worse, especially when several generations of that spread meet back up for another round at christmas."
1410,"There have also been a lot of things that we were CERTAIN would cause huge spikes and haven't, so there's no way to tell yet."
1411,"But it'll take a bit more time to know, I think."

Official estimated projections for the US 😣"
1414,People who want to be safe can get vaccinated themselves.
1415,&gt; We will remember covid same as we remember everything else.
1416,"As years go by, it will seem so long ago."
1417,It won't even take years.
1418,Covid will largely be forgotten in few weeks.
1419,"After that, it will only pop up in people's minds when they separately think about all sorts of various old events."
1420,But it won't pop up in people's minds that much automatically.
1421,"At that point, it will also not come up often in people's daily conversations."
1422,See how quickly USA adapted to 200k infections per day?
1423,"Well, it works other way as well."
1424,"USA adapted quickly to covid, and it will also quickly adapt to non-covid."

1427,Hypotheticals are the last bastion of a bad argument.
1428,"So in this hypothetical, no, I wouldn't visit my elderly relatives in a nursing home."
1429,"If they got COVID and were moved to a hospital and in critical condition, I would of course go to see them if possible."
1430,"If I worked at a nursing home I would, under any circumstances, go to a large gathering of people."
1431,It's grossly negligent.
1432,"Moving away from what might happen in a fantasy scenario I can tell you I haven't seen my grandparents since February, and that's been hard."
1433,But it's the right thing to do.
1434,"So I wear my mask, social distance, and argue with morons online who are too stupid to realize that the choices that they make impact others."
1435,"I think that our culture is unfortunately too strongly tied to the rebel bad boy image, selfishness (zero sum game winner), and conspiracy theory for us to ever embrace what is needed to get through a pandemic like this."
1436,Perhaps over several generations we can see meaningful change.
1437,I doubt if in any of our lifetimes we will see this happen though.

1442,Probably not.
1443,"However, some restrictions will continue for quite some time, such as masks, distancing, outdoor dining, limited indoor capacity, entertainment curtailed, etc."
1444,My view is Summer 2022 is when most things go back to some semblance of normal.
1445,"While it could this upcoming Summer, I highly doubt it, since many people still will not have been fully vaccinated yet."
1446,"The two dose regiment adds a 3-4 week delay, which further stretches out the timeline."
1447,"Also, the vaccines, despite providing individual immunity, won't necessarily prevent transmission to others."
1448,Many restrictions likely to remain in place until it's better documented that herd immunity throughout much of the U.S. has been reached.

1462,the peer pressure is real
1463,5000 cases per population of 67 million is manageable but only if tracking and isolation works which means the cases should be clustered i.e.
1464,"there is still strong restrictions that limit the spread (remote working, bars mostly closed, etc.)."
1465,"Finland has been hovering around that level for a couple of weeks now but cases have indeed been highly clustered to work places, schools and families."
1466,Maybe we're a little special but there are other variables than the plain case count in play.
1467,I hope they wear a mask when they come back to pick up their pets.
1468,Protect yourself
1469,No because the general public is far off from getting vaccines
1470,And people should have the ability to go into work without worrying about you spreading it to them?
1471,I don’t see why you think you’re more important than the health of everyone else you work with and their families.
1472,Because you’re taking that choice away from them.

1497,"The 1918 Flu took place at the close of WWI, I think that kind of overshadowed it in people’s memories."

1580,We will get through this
1581,Do not forget the politicians telling people to not travel for Thanksgiving while doing so themselves.
1582,What?
1583,Its responsible science to disclose all results.
1584,What do you think placebo means
1585,"Just like ""narrative"" and ""peer reviewed."""
1586,"and white kids that started using the word ""fam"""
1587,Is everyone in this subreddit a microbiologist?
1588,You make a good point about wars.
1589,I will give Trump that.
1590,He did not start wars.
1591,He has failed America in all other regards though.
1592,Dude.
1593,We are literally starting to vaccinate people as early as next week.
1594,What are you talking about?
1595,Here is a link to a story with a bit more information.
1596,https://apnews.com/article/technology-kansas-coronavirus-pandemic-c924f4f1ecc5f561e9b4fd6e6bdd0e33
1597,"And just like all of the PPP loans that went to businesses that didn't actually need them, nothing will be done about this."
1598,You also don't know what a story is.
1599,How am I not surprised?
1600,Bye.
1601,Why shouldn't people be worried about long Covid?
1602,"If people are finally considering that in addition to the death rate, then thank goodness."
1603,The confusion we are experiencing in the USA is that we had this program Operation Warp Speed that was to stockpile a lot of vaccines before they were tested.
1604,It's about the only useful thing our government was supposedly doing.
1605,It is now looking like pretty much a bust: there's hardly any to go around in this month and then next year we have to wonder if there's a cliff in late Q2.
1606,"I realize there were manufacturing difficulties, and it is amazing we have at least two vaccines that work really well."
1607,"Still, we keep getting told these beat case pie in the sky numbers that are starting to fall apart like everything else this government promised."
1608,We all know Skinner's behaviorism is the only way to make people do what we want /s
1609,Never in the field of viral conflict has so much been owed by so many to so few
1610,Fear mongering
1611,You are smart for not eating indoors.
1612,But movies theaters are probably safe.
1613,Big open spaces and you can wear your mask the whole time.
1614,Lie is immediate crossover.
1615,"Current proposal is placebos crossover upon full FDA approval, or 6 months from second placebo dose, or when they could otherwise get it based on state guidelines."
1616,Nothing immediate about any of this.
1617,6 months is April in my case assuming I'm placebo.
1618,Food was fab!
1619,Good last meal in nyc b4 the world went to hell.
1620,Cool story bro.
1621,"Yes, this is huge."
1622,Death was a much more accepted part of life in 1918.
1623,"I mean, World War I had just killed millions (especially in Europe)."
1624,Penicillin didn't even exist.
1625,You were one nasty cut away from losing a limb and potentially your life.
1626,"You mentioned all of those disease, but I'll add that while Smallpox was well-controlled in the US at the time due to use of inoculations and early vaccines, it was still something that 'people got' (it was only Jacobson v. Massachusetts in 1905 that endorsed compulsory vaccination)."
1627,"Throw on the miserable labor and living conditions of the time and the Spanish Flu was definitely a huge thing at the time (including that generation's anti-maskers), but it was one of many causes of human suffering."
1628,COVID will end up killing far fewer people in the US than the Spanish Flu by an order of magnitude (especially considering life-adjusted years).
1629,"I do think, however, that in terms of how it changed people's behaviors - it **may** be remembered as a watershed event that sparked a widescale change in the way people work."
1630,"I'm not entirely confident that virtual work will be the ""new normal"", but if it does, it has incredible impacts that I don't think we've fully absorbed."
1631,"It could very well change the shape of our cities, the population distribution in the US, the way children are raised and cared for, the types of preferred housing, and indeed the very way we meet and interact with people (think of how many people date and marry co-workers or people they meet through work events)."
1632,"If it does that, then I think COVID-19 will be remembered - not for the deaths - but rather for the catalyst it created for change."
1633,This is what we refer to as as a *Yikes!
1634,*
1635,To vaccinate or not vaccinate that is the question /s
1636,Since when was that a requirement for US cops?
1637,Hopefully we look back on today as the beginning of the end.
1638,Get vaccinated Jan. 1st
1639,"Believe what you will, I couldn't care less."
1640,I'm not dyslexic but I had skimmed the original comment and thought he had slipped ejaculation in there
1641,Honestly neither shopping or walking past someone are likely.
1642,It's more likely that she got it from sustained contact with a friend or family member.
1643,I mean right now we believe that the Vaccine will be available to the average person by april.
1644,Healthcare worker here.
1645,I'm stoked about getting my vaccine but as much as I miss going to the gym I'm not going back until there's solid data that I cannot infect others.
1646,It's not worth the risk.
1647,"Better to recommend ways to do it safely rather than ways to abstain, since it’s clear messaging about abstinence is ineffective."
1648,Smoking isn't a protected class.
1649,Unfortunately the virus doesn't care where you draw the line.
1650,Everyone has been drawing their own lines for 9 months and it works like shit.
1651,"Public health officials just tell us facts, not that it is going to be easy to act on them."
1652,Haha true good point!
1653,This is incorrect.
1654,The vaccine will induce an immune response orders of magnitude larger than natural infection.
1655,Who decides where to draw the line between disregard and blatant disregard?
1656,"What individual, other than yourself, do you trust with deciding who we should punish?"
1657,"This post appears to be about vaccines, please see [our FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/wiki/faq#wiki_where_can_i_find_information_about_the_mechanism_and_progress_of_vaccines.3F) for answers to frequently asked questions regarding the COVID-19 vaccines."

1688,"All these are unknown by several orders of magnitude:

- Minimum infectious dose
- Amount of viable virus expelled in aerosols and larger droplets in earlier stages and mild cases of the illness
- Survival time on surfaces and efficacy of disinfectants for dried saliva

1689,"For example, we have large-scale outbreaks left and right in hospitals and care homes in my area right now."
1690,"Do they all ignore hygiene measures, or is something else going on?"
1691,"I called a care worker last week, and she does really not know how it happened in her workplace to get a quarter of people infected in three days."

1694,I was looking at your response to another user....
1695,So how is it a lie?
1696,You state that issuance based on fda means immediate crossover.
1697,But you said that the authorization hasn’t come out yet(might be as early as Friday).
1698,So... where’s the lie?
1699,Why?
1700,Sounds weird to them to call it a shot.
1701,I really wish headlines would stop saying this.
1702,"Yes, TECHNICALLY it's safe and effective after one dose but it is also not actually doing the vaccine's job with one dose"
1703,"US trial started later and was delayed by the FDA for a couple months, I wouldn't expect a result from that anytime soon, probably January/February earliest."
1704,Likely the Oxford vaccine is approved everywhere except the US.
1705,I think that you are right in theory but who (except in quarantine) would stay at their hotel room?
1706,"They'll visit places and/or meet people, that's the point in traveling."
1707,Awesome
1708,Now bring it to america and stick that shit in my arms I'm so fucking ready
1709,kinda agree...can't other manufacturing countries just copy the formula from phizer and manufacturer it..would make this shit so much faster..I am just saying
1710,"I expect normalcy to mostly return by May, because I listen to the people who know about these things and pay attention to reality."
1711,"Yeah, it is baffling at first but in fact war production was quite slow to ramp up."
1712,It takes about 2 to 4 years to ramp up production to full capacity for any nation.
1713,You also need to take into account the quality: up to 30% of ammunition failed to explode.
1714,For a vaccine we cannot afford to inject people with a substandard product.
1715,"Fortunately we already produce other vaccines every year, like the flu vaccine."
1716,We also have automated production lines which did not exist in WW2.
1717,All in all the progress this year is amazingly fast.
1718,Never before has a vaccine been developed and produced within a year.
1719,The slow production of masks and other PPE is what actually amazes me.
1720,The quality does not need to be 100% even a scarf helps slow down spread.
1721,I think this is the fault of governments mostly.
1722,"Also the competition from China is hard to beat, they went all in and increased production 50 times."
1723,Quality was obviously lacking but their prices dropped quickly to a point where no one could compete.
1724,Was about to say this.
1725,😷 Op
1726,My point is clearly to point out that even if herd immunity is not going to happen quickly that there is still a personal benefit to receiving the vaccine.
1727,If you haven’t been following the storyline here in the US we can’t even get masks to 100% compliance.
1728,"No they don't, because its fake"
1729,"As someone who is not planning to be vaccinated, I completely I agree."
1730,I am accepting the risk and absolutely believe we should all get our freedoms back.
1731,But I want you to remember your words because we won’t be getting our freedoms back unless we stand up to our governments and demand them.
1732,"I know of a nurse which works in a nursing home, she only recently took the virus seriously."
1733,Was throwing parties during the summer.
1734,For some reason I always expected nurses to not be involved in illegal parties...
1735,"No, here in Europe numbers went down for a little but but they are going up again."
1736,"This is great news, but holy shit guys..."
1737,"Unless you're in healthcare, a politician, or 80+ years old, you're not gonna get this for another year at least."
1738,Moderna says they can produce 500 million by the end of 2021.
1739,That's 250 million.
1740,"Even if the others can produce twice as much as Moderna by the end of 2021, that's still only 1.25 billion vaccines by end of 2021."
1741,This isn't counting Sputnik II for obvious reasons
1742,"ok, now I'm out."
1743,Jab sounds more harsh that injection.
1744,I hear jab and I think getting stabbed by a knife.
1745,But hey I'm just a Canadian lol
1746,"My hope is that starting January 20th, 2021, Biden will help to seriously aid in these issues that Trump has royally fucked up."
1747,"Biden has a reputation for international diplomacy and isn't going to want to ruin that within the first few weeks of his presidency, but he certainly doesn't want Americans suffering any longer than they have to."
1748,"My best guess is that he's going to be aggressively working with the other candidates (J&amp;J, Astra, Moderna) to make sure that every American who wants to get vaccinated by the mid/late spring will still be able to do so."
1749,"Yes, other countries are suffering and I don't take that lightly at all, but news like this is still more disturbing to the people who reside in America because what's happening here is nothing short of a human rights disaster."
1750,Six more weeks until a new administration.
1751,It can't come soon enough.
1752,This is so silly.
1753,No one will be wearing masks after the vaccine and it's foolish to even suggest that we should.
1754,Similar to people saying we should keep wearing them during regular cold and flu seasons.
1755,It's hard enough to make people wear one during the worst of the pandemic.
1756,People HATE wearing masks.
1757,"Not just the American people, our politicians who pass meaningless mask mandates with huge exceptions for bars and restaurants."
1758,"This is by design, many places decided money &gt; public health and refused to enact policies that might impact the profit of bar and restaurant owners."
1759,If you see my dad tell him to hurry up.
1760,We've been waiting 7 years for him to bring the milk home.
1761,"Oh, you mean the thing that is the reason we have stringent regulation standards today?"
1762,"Everyone has a right to own a gun though, you have to assume danger and prove otherwise for your own safety."
1763,Basic strategy.
1764,can't like manufacturing labs just copy the formula for vaccine and distribute it...would be faster just saying.
1765,Bingo.
1766,pious salafi muslim could do this all their life.
1767,"People might be raising their eyebrows at this comment but even during the early stages of the pandemic, when their local politicians were tripping over each other and wasting time with their face-saving and whatnot, their scientists and medical professionals had continued to provide prompt and quality data about the then-emerging disease."
1768,"They had the virus sequenced by late december or early january IIRC, along with a lot of good work that sadly got tripped up by all the bureaucratic bullshit."
1769,Nope CT
1770,I recognize the serious impact on small businesses.
1771,The pandemic has impacted almost everything.
1772,However Yelp isn’t accurate about the location and hours of many businesses.
1773,I doubt they know when any of these businesses closed.
1774,Yelp directed me to an abandoned building more than once.
1775,App deleted
1776,Why is it a problem a 90 year old got her shot?
1777,That's..
1778,The biggest need for this vaccine and I don't get why this bothers you.
1779,"I definitely look for updates daily to see when they're going to wrap, but no additional guidance beyond early 2021."
1780,Social media is great for this.
1781,I can get all the alternative facts I want from easy to digest infographics.
1782,"All the rage bait and reasons to hate the groups I already hate, none of the guilt or difficulty understanding complicated things like *reality*."
1783,"The head of Warp Speed is with Moderna who's using the exact same method to create their vaccine, so this is a pretty lazy take."
1784,The Swiss army virus /s
1785,Why are you booing this man?
1786,He’s right.
1787,"She just raised $100k on her kickstarter in 11 hours, she probably was waiting to get arrested for the attention and this setup."
1788,The camera angle was perfect.
1789,BLM is not racism.
1790,Strawman much?
1791,I was about to comment something similar.
1792,lol
1793,I guess Trump wasn’t lying when he said we’d have a vaccine before the end of the year
1794,"OMG, this is how the misinformation parade happens."
1795,Who cares if it's somewhat effective after one dose?
1796,Get that 90-95% or get out.
1797,Amplifying this one shot info is how you get people to act cavalier after the first dose.
1798,"Or worse yet, how you get them to skip the second one."
1799,This headline needs to go away.
1800,It will create stupid.
1801,"I know the first 300,000-500,000 people on NJ to get vaccinated are us healthcare workers and people at risk"
1802,"If you think of it, if everyone wore a mask, then the virus has to get through TWO layers of masks (one from source person, the other in destination person), so it's double the level of effectiveness... Plus even if it penetrates, it's a significantly reduce ""Viral load"" or ""infective dose"" which potentially lead to less severe form of disease to avoid intubation or ventilator."

1826,This is the low bar by which they judge their actions.
1827,"Yes, we ordered 100 million pfzier doses (2 doses per person for full vaccination)."
1828,We've also ordered many from suppliers in late stage clinical trials.

1832,I think it is a damn shame that the president is not telling people to wear masks and avoid gathering.
1833,So fauci is fighting an uphill battle against his supporters and other selfish people.
1834,Mate i read the article and i was so confused about what exactly are you replying to?
1835,The cover up thing in china or that china knew the existence of the the virus before late december?
1836,The article literally said that she found out evidence of possible human to human contact transmission and nothing about china knowing the existence of the virus before late december.
1837,"In addition, if you know how administation work in the science field, even if you found evidence, you need peer review and then more paperwork and other thing."
1838,Less than 1 week is not enough for her finding to get to WHO.
1839,So it is possible for WHO to not know the existence of the paper when reporting that they have no evidence of human to human transmission.
1840,There have been some adverse effects.
1841,The Pfizer trials showed 4 cases of facial paralysis in the vaccinated group and 0 in the control group.
1842,All awesome ideas that require a level of spending and/or effort that states aren't putting out right now.

1852,Why in the world would you even take a chance?
1853,The single dose doesn’t fully or even mostly protect you and it may not last as long in terms of immunity.
1854,We certainly won’t be able to get this situation under control if people keep getting sick.
1855,I can tell already that it’s going to be an uphill battle getting people to finish the actual vaccination.
1856,I guess I shouldn’t be surprised since about half of us still don’t even think covid is real.

1930,Children who got the vaccine ended up having a worse reaction when they encountered the disease in the wild.
1931,There's a swine flu vaccine that caused narcolepsy https://www.cbsnews.com/news/how-a-swine-flu-shot-led-to-narcolepsy/.

If you look at the current distribution of flu vaccine, it is widely available, buy if a large portion of population were to try and get it in a week or 2, it would be a difficult task."

1979,"Yea, if everyone wore a mask, then the virus has to go through TWO masks (from source person, to destination person), that's double the level of effectiveness, regardless of airborne or droplets."
1980,"It also significantly reduces the ""viral load"" or ""infective dose"" which potentially can lead to a less severe disease due to small viral load."

1997,"Until 80% of the U.S. population has either been infected, or vaccinated we'll be social distancing and wearing masks, which looks to be about the summer of 2022."
1998,"However now that vaccines are starting to rollout the deniers will be in full ""there isn't anything to worry about"" mode, and the less educated, and those who are tired of what's happening will be happy to jump on board with the no masks, no distancing bandwagon."

2001,"Hospitals are close to the breaking point now, as hospitals get overwhelmed we could see the Case Fatality Rate (CFR) jump to 10% or 15% in local areas due to hospitals in an area that are over capacity."

2003,"If someone needs round the clock care, intravenous drugs and fluids, along with oxygen and they are sent home they have zero chance of surviving."
2004,This is how the CFR skyrockets.
2005,"If the the hospitals get overwhelmed at a national level we could see a CFR upwards of 5%, that means 1 out of every 20 people who get infected will die."
2006,"If we get to that point at a national level it will take a good 120 days of strict mask wearing and social isolation to stop the hospital overcrowding, and even with mass deaths I just don't see that happening, because we have too many people in this country who are either selfish and childish, or completely delusional."

2015,The lack in trust in our leaders on the subject: they went back and fourth on whether masks were safe or dangerous for the first half the year.
2016,"The fact that msm, facebook and twitter have politicized it and in turn pretty much censors any one with an opposing viewpoint which adds suspicion."
2017,"The main problem with this was at the begining some sources were saying things that didnt go along with the msm narrative, masks being safe for everyone not just health workers, being one of them, but there were other topics too, and the sites and journalists that put out this information were cancelled and censored."
2018,"Then months later suddenly msm starts pushing the exact same thing they censored and cancelled people for talkiing about, this added to peoples distrust of the mainstream narrative."

2038,The top is doing a really good job of keeping the country divided.

The overall phrasing of this comment and especially the use of the adjective “valid” is indicative of trolling or at best ignorance, but for the rest of us, here’s an excerpt that proves the source is disingenuous at best:

&gt; And here’s an important point: COVID-19 vaccines are NOT designed to prevent infection."
2049,"As detailed in “How COVID-19 Vaccine Trials Are Rigged,” a “successful” vaccine merely needs to reduce the severity of the symptoms."
2050,"They’re not even looking at reducing infection, hospitalization or death rates."
2051,This is clearly ridiculous.
2052,The reason for the sweeping lockdowns is that society cannot function when our health care systems collapse.
2053,"Reducing the severity of the symptoms is crucial EXACTLY BECAUSE this reduces hospitalization and death rates, and prevents overwhelming the health care system."
2054,This is not a unique falsehood.

2141,Spent three months paired with an experienced ICU nurse every day as my of learning critical care nursing.

2143,Having sick people who can crash on you at any moment is the job.
2144,"Though stressful, most ICU nurses are the “run towards the fire” type and function very well under pressure."
2145,Absolutely NOBODY functions well with that level of responsibility when you don’t actually know what you’re doing.
2146,"Nurses that don’t ask questions are the most worrisome to us, and even after three months of learning I still had TONS of questions."
2147,We need a solution to a problem and this isn’t it.

2162,One thing the US has generally done well with is food/drug safety research.
2163,FDA and USDA in particular.
2164,"Everything from figuring out what temps to safe to cook poultry to reviewing drug safety, the US actually does a pretty solid job."
2165,The US throws a ton of money into this effort.
2166,And much of the world piggybacks on the research/findings since it's all public info.
2167,"Of course a few drugs that have been released are later discovered to have negative impacts, but that's possible of everything."
2168,They can only go as far as science allows in terms of understanding at the time.
2169,The US is also pretty good at pulling stuff off the shelves and updating warnings.
2170,But overall I'd say this is one area the US does particularly well.

2190,"Said this in February, March, April, May and so on."
2191,This has been no surprise to me at all.
2192,It's all assuming you have proper PPE.
2193,If it's about spreading FUD then that needs to have a lid on it.
2194,If there are verifiable issues then that can be discussed in a sane manner.
2195,"Since you’re apparently an expert on mRNA vaccines, please explain."
2196,"&gt; I offered multiple citations, still disbelief

We live in a post fact world now."
2197,The Republican machine has declared feelings are as valid as facts.
2198,"It's Republican leaders and Republican media that allows this to happen because they push feelings as facts, almost none of them push back against it, they are aiding and abetting this post fact world for personal gain (money and power)."
2199,This is not seen on the left aside from personal blog posts and twitter posts.
2200,"The left does not have senators, governors, house members, every single media channel reporting the same lies."
2201,"They keep eachother in check, if a Democrat senator lies then the media and their colleagues will call them out, if a Republican senator lies he is backed up by the entire right wing machine from the president to senators to fox news to radio shows, they are in complete lockstep pushing lies as reality."
2202,There's one time vaccines you get as a child.
2203,That's what I was referring to.
2204,"When so many people want to make it a moral failing and try to find a reason to say someone deserves to get covid (were they wearing masks, were they going out to bars, where they having dinner parties?)"
2205,"I definitely don't think it comes down to ""people are dumb selfish assholes"" I think it comes down to ""people are afraid someone is going to blame/judge them for their activities so they don't wan't to cooperate""."
2206,I hear they can track you down to the square meter if you take all six.
2207,"/s, if that wasn't already obvious."
2208,"Great news, now that we have some vaccines that work the key thing is getting them out as quickly as possible."
2209,"This nightmare is almost over (hopefully), onto the next nightmare."
2210,Just our president and his sycophants.
2211,someone didn't think this through.
2212,People &amp; animals have had to have one for decades.
2213,Why would we stop now?
2214,That efficacy is still significantly higher than what the target number was.
2215,"There aren’t resources being wasted or drained here, each company is making their own vaccine, they aren’t handing out the formula to other companies."
2216,AstraZeneca has a shit ton of resources at their disposal specifically for their vaccine.
2217,"Plus, it’s more easily stored than the mRNA vaccines, which makes it an extremely appealing option for smaller, poorer or more remote areas."
2218,"It has its role to play in ending the pandemic, and its an important one."
2219,Lol true
2220,Necessity is the mother of invention.
2221,Are there any cases of side effects manifesting more than a few months after being vaccinated?
2222,it's like when you mix every soda together at taco bell
2223,Search for wood near dawn.
2224,/s
2225,Is this enough peer review for you?
2226,"On Thursday, the FDA will convene what's essentially a science court that will debate — in public and livestreamed — just how safe and effective it is."
2227,A panel of independent scientists will pick apart the FDA’s first-pass review before recommending whether the vaccine appears safe and effective enough for millions of Americans.
2228,"I agree with you, but unfortunately I’m not sure the California or much of the west cost government does."
2229,"Realistically by March 1ish(maybe earlier), if 100mil in the US are truly vaccinated, coupled with natural immunity, and the weather warms and the seasonal respiratory illnesses decline, there SHOULD be gradual, but quick, loosening of ALL restrictions."
2230,I’m ok with recommendations but that’s IT.
2231,"It sure is, my good friend!"
2232,I own nothing and I've never been happier!
2233,[removed]
2234,You may have brief flu-like symptoms and/or pain at the injection site but that's the immune system reacting like it's supposed to.
2235,Yeah even still
2236,"Nah, these chuds would have done this stupid shit even if our government had an actual leader who accepted the advice of epidemiologists."
2237,Everyone at fault should be on the hook for some sort of felony.
2238,"I *would* be first in line as soon as I could, but we don't yet know if these vaccines completely prevent infection with the virus itself (the current efficacy figures are for lack of *symptoms* I think), and I'd love to not infect my 17-year-old brother with something that could leave him with aftereffects because he couldn't finish getting vaccinated first."
2239,"If the current situation hasn't shown you why the fuck many Americans can't stay home, you have your head up your ass."
2240,"WWI, The Red Scare, the rise of Fascism, The Great Depression, The Dust Bowl, WWII, The end of the Colonial Powers, the start of the Cold War, all of this happened within 25 years."
2241,"The first half of the 20^th Century was just packed with insane, world-changing events with unmeasurable human suffering."
2242,"The 1918 pandemic was just one of many, and arguably the only natural one instead of being caused by geopolitical events, so it get overlooked."
2243,"COVID is happening in comparatively quiet times, and will have a much more lasting cultural impact as a result."
2244,That was a good post.
2245,I didn’t see it that way till now.
2246,&gt; No I suggest we wear masks for as long as the medical experts say so.
2247,Nah.
2248,"I've worn a mask, avoided going out, and skipped out on family and friends since early March."
2249,Once I get the vaccine I'm done.
2250,For countries that currently have covid under control (e.g.
2251,"most east Asian countries, Australia, NZ), there is little practical difference between 70% or 90% effectiveness for an individual."
2252,Either will stop the virus spreading and becoming an epidemic if enough people get the vaccine.
2253,"My wife has the unique ability to drastically alter my mental health, sometimes for the best, sometimes for the worst."
2254,As I do her.
2255,"It's only a partial blueprint in the case of the mRNA virus, specifically of the novel spike protein."
2256,Erdogan’s puppet at work
2257,Longer life expectancy because of FDA?
2258,I don't see the correlation.
2259,"""This other nation did it, therefore we should too"" is not a quote that I want to be used to authorize the use of something I'm going to inject into my body."
2260,The US is planning a review and likely EUA approval within a week of UK.
2261,Relax.
2262,The fact that it is approved in UK **AND** gets approved by FDA is all the more reason to feel comfortable that the vaccine is solid.
2263,I don’t know about speaking about and holding remembrances for it directly but I know some of my behaviors are forever changed.
2264,"In the future I guarantee my kids are going to be wondering “why does mom always buy a can of lysol every time she goes grocery shopping?” And if they ask, I’ll explain."
2265,That’s about it.

2272,"Would have had Pfizer vaccines sooner but Trump &amp; his people passed on it, so Pfizer has other countries that have not passed on it to get orders ready for."
2273,"After those countries vaccines are created, then more will be made for the US."
2274,Apparently other world leaders didn’t pass up vaccines like our ‘leader’ did.
2275,"I was afraid it was a sarcastic, and  morbid, comment, but I needed to know."
2276,"The correct answer is 730,000."
2277,Yeah the FDA knew it poisoned people.
2278,They saw it caused vomiting and other problems in patients during trials.
2279,You know what’s worse than that though?
2280,Dying a painful death from whatever disease you contracted as a result of AIDS.
2281,Back then AIDS had a 100% death rate in a matter of years.
2282,"AZT extended life span by at least a little bit, so patients on it were actually helped."
2283,The side effects were tolerated because there was no other drug available that could demonstrate the same lifespan extension as AZT at the point.
2284,Scientists were just doing anything they could.
2285,You know what we haven’t seen in any of these vaccine trials?
2286,Extreme side effects.
2287,And aren't swollen lymph nodes usually just a sign of the immune system activating?
2288,I'm not sure I'd put much faith in internet surveys of Facebook users in gauging the effectiveness of actual mask wearing.
2289,"I'm sure lots of people report that they *always* wear a mask when they don't, as well as those who wear them incorrectly/under their noses, wear coverings that are questionably effective at stopping them from spreading disease etc."
2290,"These governors are getting out of control, jesus christ."
2291,"Fuck man, I feel that deep in my bones."

2303,"Well, someone's got to sell that one, too, I guess."
2304,The wrath of the dead.
2305,They have to stop to write a press release after every vaccination.
2306,Takes time.
2307,Immunocompromised individuals tend to not be able to mount a proper immune response to certain vaccines.
2308,"As a result, they could actually get really suck from the vaccine."
2309,"Specifically, live-attenuated vaccines tend to be avoided by those who are immunocompromised."
2310,"There are several other types of vaccines that aren't ""live"" vaccines that we usually take."
2311,"Got it, thanks for clarifying."
2312,"So you're right that mRNA in general is not one thing; however, in this case, the vaccine is only including one sequence of mRNA to encode for a specific protein -- the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein."
2313,This isn't a genetically modified cold virus -- it's a specifically synthesized piece of RNA.
2314,"I actually just wrote up another comment which I think might help: https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/k96ng0/how_is_it_possible_to_create_a_safe_and_effective/gf3npgy/

2315,"Yes, our numbers are higher than what we think, but it isn't because Jay Inslee is hiding the numbers."
2316,I was tested over 2 weeks ago and still haven't gotten my results.
2317,"Tbe system is flooded with people who have gotten tested, which has bottlenecked the reporting of cases."
2318,People are choosing to not get tested after coming down with an illness.
2319,"And people never become symptomatic, never knowing they are sick."
2320,The numbers we have are bad enough.
2321,I assure you Inslee is not the reason they aren't bad enough.
2322,Same.

2329,Thanks so much for this!
2330,"I never had a flu shot in my life, that's more than 30+ years now.. and counting."
2331,Is there some kind of cult in the USA who has flu shots every year?
2332,I'm glad this subreddit hasn't fallen victim to this instance of goalpost shifting for once.
2333,Are healthcare workers not also part of the general population.
2334,Are they not allowed in elevators or to see their friends?
2335,Truly a /r/cripplingalcoholism sort of a nightmare.

2337,"if weed is ok, then we're good."

2342,We'll all collectively do our best to forget this ever happened.
2343,Just like the 1918 pandemic.
2344,I know you’re not trying to convince me.
2345,You would use a source if you were.
2346,Agree.
2347,"I wear masks any time I leave my home, but after I get the vaccine (with a two week wait after the second dose), I don't expect to wear masks or socially distant anymore."
2348,"I'm young and (knock on wood) healthy, so by the time I can get the vaccine, it will be available to all adults."
2349,"Even among the elderly, COVID-19 mostly only kills fat people."
2350,Beat me to it
2351,One thing that's concerning and the article does not address... have they determined whether this vaccine only prevents the symptoms of COVID-19 infection or if it prevents the infection itself?
2352,A few weeks ago Pfizer and Moderna both detailed that they didn't know this information.
2353,Do we have this data yet?
2354,"This is VERY important because if it only prevents symptoms, an infected individual can still transmit the virus to others."
2355,I won't be getting any vaccine until we have this data.
2356,And another thing to remember is that this vaccine won't be a magic bullet.
2357,Many virologists around the globe are saying we will need to remain vigilant and keep our masks on and distance even after the vaccine is released.
2358,I encourage you to do your own research and come to your own conclusions though!
2359,"I just see so many of these stories about the vaccine and overwhelming comments that hint people are treating it as a magic ""go back to normal"" shot, when it shouldn't be treated this way."

2385,It is like holding Trump responsible for an inept state level public health inspector in Arkansas.
2386,I assume that the people most at fault are a small handful of city and prefecture level bureaucrats responsible for public health.
2387,The first would be the administrators responsible for public health in Wuhan.
2388,They would have initially ignored it (or not seen it because they treated it like a no-show job they got due to a brother-in-law being a communist party official).
2389,"If they had done the job properly, it would not be as big an issue."
2390,The 2nd is whoever is most directly responsible for trying to silence  Dr. Li Wenliang when he was trying to warn people instead of properly investigating those warnings.
2391,"I am not sure if it is the same guy who failed to do the public health job in Wuhan who later tried to cover their ass, or just some other mid level guy who's job it was to silence anything that makes the government look bad."
2392,"China may have fucked up here, but it is more an issue of the kind of corruption where people get jobs based on connections instead of competence."

2665,"As this rate, higher."
2666,We're undercounting by about 5x
2667,Immunity and herd immunity are two different things.
2668,The vaccines do not make you immune they make you more resistant.
2669,Herd immunity is when we have a large enough set of the population of the earth with a high resistance that the disease has difficulty spreading.
2670,For example measles was considered eradicated for all intents and purposes due to herd immunity up until antivaxxors stopped getting the vaccine and we now see regional and localized outbreaks.
2671,The most important part of the vaccine perhaps is that no one who contracted covid19 during the trials suffered from a “severe case”.
2672,So even without herd immunity those who have been vaccinated should be much less likely to pass away from the illness.
2673,That alone is of great personal benefit to having been vaccinated even if we are quite some while away from herd immunity.
2674,That comment was directed towards the AstraZeneca vaccine since they don't have any idea how to run a robust scientific trail.
2675,Hopefully the trial announced today will be much more robust.
2676,There is a steady trickle of bad news coming out about how many doses of vaccine will be ready as the winter goes on.
2677,I think we got ahead of ourselves with the hope here.
2678,We (US) mismanaged the Covid response pretty badly...
2679,I don't know why we should expect the vaccine rollout to go well either.
2680,In terms of the US dollar which has been losing its value
2681,Much lower.
2682,We have about 25% of the population with antibodies.
2683,We have deaths VERY concentrated in 60+ age range.

2834,"I’m in Canada so this is an article I remember reading, https://www.ctvnews.ca/health/coronavirus/perverse-logic-don-t-compare-the-flu-to-covid-19-1.5000965

It presents a lot of information on the stats but also why it’s not always a good argument to compare the two."
2835,"Pfizer can only deliver 6M dose this year because of supply issues

[https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2020/11/24/vaccine-plan-first-doses/](https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2020/11/24/vaccine-plan-first-doses/)"
2836,Yes..a lot of false negatives early testing fyi
2837,"&gt;  but the US isn’t the whole world any more, especially given how badly it has handled this virus."
2838,This should probably be said more.
2839,I'm actually really hoping the rest of the world mandates you need a vaccine and proof before travel because otherwise a lot of Americans won't even bother getting it and this shit will just continue.
2840,Our place is knocked down in the world now and we need to be forced to face what a disaster we are.
2841,I’m not here to argue masks and science.
2842,You asked me a question about what I’ve seen and I shared that with you.
2843,"Like I said, it’s great that everyone seems to comply at where you are, that’s not the case here."
2844,"Today we are at an 18%+ positivity rate, record numbers today, and our positivity rate keeps climbing from month to month."
2845,"Like I said, I see what I see."
2846,"I know what I am still hearing people say on a daily basis, at least in my area."
2847,"And when you have a loved one in the hospital, it’s absolutely maddening."
2848,"THAT was the point of my post- anonymously sharing my current experience and stress and grief in a place where people are talking about the same topic, people who can relate in a sense- not to debate what is happening and what other people are doing in other parts of the country, not to debate whether or not there’s really a concern in my area compared to others."
2849,"I’m not here to debate masks when I have much bigger, heavier things on my heart right now."
2850,I’m not sure it’s started yet.
2851,We haven’t had the thanksgiving cases yet.
2852,All candidates in local elections in el paso county are independent
2853,These kids are paying the price of keeping your churches and indoor dining rooms open.
2854,This country is absolutely disgusting.
2855,The only silver lining is that it’s very obvious China has overtaken America as the world’s superpower.
2856,That was only the Moderna one that had 100% reduction in severe cases.
2857,I thought the Pfizer one couldn't show that with their test data.
2858,Will someone break this news to multiple workplaces across the country?
2859,Sorry for your loss.
2860,Thank you for still caring for others.
2861,Been living under a rock?
2862,We already vaccinated over a million.
2863,Careening?
2864,"I thought we were already there, we just haven't recognized it yet"
2865,Damnit.
2866,I miss it every year.
2867,"I agree, people are silly."
2868,"Remember, the human race isn't actually this fucked up."
2869,American culture is fucked up.
2870,Much of the rest of the world is managing.
2871,"It's not the end of the world, or of humanity's future, or the end of hope."
2872,But it is likely the end of America as an admired nation.
2873,The long-term foreign policy fallout from the loss of US soft power from this fuckup will likely be larger than many are in expecting.
2874,The whole world is watching...
2875,In horror.
2876,Nobody wants to be like America anymore.
2877,That will be a problem for the USA going forward.
2878,Lots of unconstitutional things are needed for results like Taiwan.
2879,Would be nice if we had them now tbh.
2880,"If people forget them, no problem."
2881,"Once everyone else has been vaccinated a year from now, they can come back and have their do-over."
2882,Hell yeah!
2883,"Where I work, we’ve had two parents have to quit to be SAHs because their kids were failing all of their all-online classes."
2884,"It’s scary, because this is the rural Midwest."
2885,"All of the parents who were initially on board with keeping their kids home and safe are now begging for schools to reopen regardless of consequences because they’re worried about their kids’ grades, they’re just sick of spending so much time with their kids, or both."
2886,The virus was not discovered way earlier.
2887,"It's just that after scientists had sequenced the genome and devised tests and so on, when they went back to stored samples from last year, they managed to detect the [earliest positive sample from mid-Nov](https://www.livescience.com/first-case-coronavirus-found.html)."
2888,But that doesn't mean they knew what it was in mid-Nov; that was just another case of unexplained non-bacterial pneumonia back then.
2889,People like u/match_d can't tell the difference between hindsight and a cover-up.
2890,Unfortunately the deaths skew to the poor and old who don’t pay much taxes anyways or in some cases are net receivers .
2891,So cynically you could argue some might want them to die as horrible as it sounds
2892,What else would they do?
2893,They always mess things up.
2894,"I'm in J&amp;J trial, I think I got the vaccine."
2895,Their phase1/2 data looked good.
2896,"If you enter the study, and if pfizer is available to you, you can exit the study."
2897,Research staff can explain all this to you.
2898,But estimates are general population will be vaccinated available after April.
2899,It's true.
2900,Isn't the average stay for a Covid patient like double or triple what a typical ICU stay is?
2901,I wouldn't do it if I were you...jobs are our livelihood and disrupting someone's life like that can bring some serious guilt and karma....i know how tempted you are but let the place of employment find out from someone else...just my 2 cents.
2902,Yes I’m sure the Iranian civilians will think hard about their actions here.
2903,You’re a fucking monster.

2936,They aren't.

2941,"that's true, but their criticisms from both democrats as well as republicans would come in in exactly the same form."
2942,"with the democratic base calling for *more* intervention, and the republican base calling for less."

2944,"and don't get me wrong, they *exist*, but they don't control the narrative of the right wing."
2945,"edit:

and to the extent that those extreme minority calls for trump to have done more about the pandemic do exist on the right, they're from the sort of 90's republicans that the democratic party has also pandered to -- like the john kasichs, the mitt romneys, etc."

2978,Western society let you down for the most part.
2979,Sorry about that.
2980,:(
2981,I think the fear among a lot of people is once seniors are vaccinated everything will go back to normal and COVID will spread like crazy but it won't matter anymore because there aren't a huge number of deaths and hospitalizations.
2982,Is this really true?
2983,Didn't they run their trials with the two doses already?
2984,"I don't remember when I first learned that the mRNA vaccines would require two doses, but it feels like we've known that for a very long time."
2985,Literally all it does is shit on international relations so he can pretend he’s a big boy who did something
2986,You don't have to be wealthy to be involved
2987,70% vaccinated is what experts are hoping for.
2988,Masks are still going to recommended as you could still get covid.
2989,A vaccine card is being worked and proposed right now.
2990,"&gt; If he isn't careful Trump

Has he ever been?"
2991,Thanks for posting this article.
2992,So much denial going on while hospitals are collapsing.

3000,"You know, as a Jew and not one of the ultra ultra Orthodox ones, the synagogue has been closed here *since March*."
3001,We didn't have Passover or any of the high holidays in the fall.
3002,No one bitched and complained.
3003,This week is Hanukkah and no one is crying that we don't get Hanukkah.
3004,Pride was also cancelled which honestly is a religious event for so many people who have been cast aside by their families or caregivers (like myself growing up in foster care) for being LGBTQ.
3005,"I don't have people here to celebrate anything with, but still."
3006,"It's really frustrating because they act like other important things in people's lives aren't happening, weren't cancelled, or didn't need adjustments to be made."
3007,Argh.
3008,Was the wedding outside?
3009,I heard that large gatherings outside don’t spread the virus.
3010,Prison.
3011,"&gt; As the number of COVID-19 cases in Alberta continues to escalate, Antonio wants people to fully understand the risks of the virus — especially that the disease can have dire consequences, even among healthy individuals."
3012,&gt; Antonio used to exercise every day; now she struggles to get up a set of stairs without panting.
3013,"&gt; **""The media and the medical community seem to give the impression that you are either recovered within 10 days and life is normal again, or you die,""** Antonio said."
3014,"&gt; ""And there is a huge group of people that are struggling somewhere in the middle of that and our lives are impacted every day in terrible ways."""
3015,"About 65 million people that got the virus are still alive, id be very curious to know if someone had data on the percentage expected to be long haulers with serious complications (things that impact day to day living)."
3016,We seem to be hearing about this a lot more recently.
3017,I feel like this virus is like a giant wildfire.
3018,"When it hits a big community some die, some suffer major burns, minor burns, some have temporary breathing issues and some suffer for life."
3019,"Like fire, you cannot always predict the damage while it rages."
3020,"normally, 90-95% is considered herd immunity achieved."
3021,I thought you were implying I was somehow politicizing the pandemic with my comment.
3022,Point taken.
3023,He’s such a whiny prat.
3024,Was it really that hard?
3025,"It was a reasonable assumption in the summer that BioNTech/Pfizer would have one of the first vaccines available, and they seemed to be one of the more promising candidates."
3026,So why not put down a billion or two to get a hold of their vaccines?
3027,"The economic impact of the pandemic is measured in trillions, not billions."
3028,People are shook because Pfizer won the social media war of being “The Vaccine” as a stock owner that makes me happy.
3029,"But as a person with common sense, we are going to have a couple of options for vaccine sources and with targeted deployment we will be in a lot better shape quickly."
3030,"&gt; Boobies23, everyone hates masks

Unpopular opinion -- I really like masks during winter."
3031,"They're providing such a warm snug center for my focus, while the wind lashes at any bare skin."
3032,I could see myself using more ski and disposable masks during future cold &amp; flu &amp; coronavirus seasons.
3033,"We had the same issues in Melbourne (Aus, not FL)."
3034,You have people working in multiple homes cross spreading it as well - they are very difficult environments - a few had a few hundred cases (!)
3035,"I could only visit through outside window and phone (Before the 5klm lockdown was enforced) - without that sort of draconian measures, you get people dying."
3036,&gt; so I guess this is a way to try and keep those doses in the US.
3037,By executive order lol.
3038,Nothing will happen
3039,"Research that is what, less than a year old?"
3040,That's not long-term.
3041,That simply isn't related to lack of school

3044,"4 and 2, everyone at home."
3045,"Bedtime has meant wine or beer more often when it was just once or twice a month before, just in social situations or after work on Friday."
3046,I’m not sure if you’re trolling or seriously criticizing people who’ve been impacted by lockdowns.
3047,There are thousands of people who’ve lost their businesses because of the lockdowns and restrictions.
3048,It is extremely insensitive to criticize people who are trying to figure out a way to take care of their families.
3049,"There are millions of people who have been seriously impacted financially, emotionally and other health issues because of the lockdowns."
3050,My goodness the insensitivity is incredible.
3051,"It's the head of warp speeds estimate, apparently it's supposed to be sooner: https://medicalxpress.com/news/2020-12-million-people-vaccinated-february.html"
3052,Click bait shit gets by in this fucking dumb sub that is supposed to be informative... smh
3053,The data could use a dictionary.
3054,I kind of love you.
3055,So no actual response there chief just Xbox live level shots?
3056,Next time just say 'no u reeeeee'
3057,Not one of those has been approved.
3058,"The one closest to it, or genius president rejected, probably because they were not part of his warpspeed project"
3059,You had a misconception if you thought the goal of vaccinations was to prevent spread of disease.
3060,"I understand that the goalposts have been shifted completely outside of the stadium at this point but at one point the marketing was ""we need to prevent hospitals from getting overwhelmed"", which is achieved by vaccinating the demographics that supply the vast majority of hospitalizations."
3061,Public health doesn't care about someone getting sick as long as they have unimpeded access to treatment.

3063,The best people.
3064,According to only the best people.
3065,I’m confused why it’s an issue.
3066,"100M doses from Pfizer alone in Q1, plus another 50M in June is enough to vaccinate 75M Americans."
3067,I don’t know how much Moderna had planned to have available to the US by April but if we assume it’s the same ..... the ability to vaccinate half the country.
3068,Add in J&amp;J and AstraZeneca......
3069,I think they’re covered
3070,From a DW article today.
3071,"""All patients tested negative for COVID-19."
3072,"Air pollution, water or food contamination is also ruled out after tests were carried out."
3073,"It is some mystery illness and more lab tests are being carried out to find out what it is,"" Rao said."
3074,"Herd immunity due to the number of people vaccinated, not by letting the virus run rampant."

3085,We created this disasters ourselves.
3086,"Wow, what a nonsense, know-nothing take from someone who doesn't understand that the US isn't just one big city."
3087,Antibodies appear to remain in recovered patients for 3-6 months before fading.
3088,"This is typical, as, when the pathogen reappears, our T cells manufacture new antibodies."
3089,"However we dont have good data on SARS-CoV-2 immune response, and not all pathogens have that sort of arc."
3090,"For example, some pathogens are *more* harmful in subsequent exposures, while others (like AIDS) 'erase' themselves from your immune systems memory, and your body fails to give an immune response at all."
3091,"I dont believe either of those scenarios will play out here, though i'm hesitant to draw the easy comparison to  Influenza and make any assumptions about how this will all play out over the next year."
3092,"I believe if we get to Christmas 2021 and we see a fairly flat, and vastly smaller infection curve, we'll have reason for confidence in sterilizing immunity."

3096,"from pfizer's press release following their first authorization : Through its existing mRNA production sites in Mainz and Idar-Oberstein, Germany, BioNTech is able to produce mRNA for commercial supply after having already produced the vaccine candidate doses for the clinical trials."
3097,"BioNTech will also increase its manufacturing capacity in 2021, once a third site in Germany will start manufacturing to provide further capacities for a global supply of the potential vaccine."
3098,"Critical to distribution in the U.K. will be Pfizer’s manufacturing site in Puurs, Belgium, one of Pfizer’s largest sterile injectable sites."
3099,"The Puurs site is being used primarily for European supply but will also serve as back up supply to Kalamazoo, Michigan, for the U.S. market."
3100,"the last line is key, the US market cannot be supported by just kalamazoo."
3101,How is that 100 million?
3102,Anyway I posted before as did others that the numbers seemed to good to be true.

3105,Yes.
3106,"There a few real American Companies, like 'Hobby Lobby', Boeing and 'defense contractors'."
3107,"Even Ford makes cars and parts around the world, and anything assembled in the USA is made with parts from around the world (including Boeing aircraft)."

3109,"Now that COVID is averaging over 2,100 deaths per day, it is the number one cause of death within this brutal winter wave."
3110,"Even surpassing heart disease, which is usually the number one killer."
3111,And sadly this gap will likely widen considerably in the coming weeks.
3112,And 75% live in GOP Staten Island.

3118,at least he got to be right all along
3119,As if one thing communicated by the WHO means everything else ever said is false.
3120,You’re so lazy to make that your argument.
3121,"Based on your logic, everything Dr. Fauci has said is wrong because he once said, “But this is not a major threat to the people of the United States and this is not something that the citizens of the United States right now should be worried about."""
3122,"So based on your idiotic logic, Fauci is wrong about everything because he once said the virus isn’t anything to worry about."
3123,"Fauci is wrong on everything, right?"
3124,"Call me a cynic, but even that feels a little too optimistic."
3125,I hope the author is correct.
3126,The reason this person can’t understand it because they aren’t a selfish asshole.

3129,Death isn't the only concern.
3130,There are more people alive than dead that have debilitating and chronic conditions that were caused by Covid.
3131,We used to see a lot of mixed couples coming up to Denmark from Germany for a weekend stay+wedding.
3132,It was easier than in Germany :)
3133,I actually know of a couple that can barely take care of themselves due to mental issues.
3134,They decided to whip each others asses when covid started.
3135,In front of the kids.
3136,No easy answer.
3137,I wish more people would try to get the number of cases down so everyone could do what is needed.
3138,Still plenty of reckless people in my area.
3139,"Well 20ish million this year, in theory."
3140,And an additional 40 million people by the end of next year.
3141,Plus there's the Moderna vaccine which I can't remember how much was purchased.
3142,It might be the same amount.
3143,And J&amp;J might have their info ready to submit by January or February.
3144,His new name is Covid Giuliani.
3145,Indeed.

3147,That's an incredible and sobering statistic.

3157,"If we made literally no changes, it would have swept through the population in a month, requiring mass graves for 1% of those infected and for anybody else with what would have been treatable trauma while all the healthcare workers were sick for a month or so."

4053,"Yet, as part of our test and trace system people are asked to declare where they had been in the week leading up to infection, and this information is made publicly available on the website of the Office for National Statistics."

4057,"With a population of just over 56 million here in England, that's around 1 in 6 of our population being school children."
4058,"Not every child has been going to school due to having to self-isolate or parent concern, so say 1 in 7 of our population had been in a school that week while 1 in 4 infected had been in a school that week."

4114,"* \- The Pfizer thermal shippers, in which doses will arrive, that can be used as temporary storage units by refilling with dry ice every five days for **up to 30 days of storage**."
4115,* \- Refrigeration units that are commonly available in hospitals.
4116,The vaccine can be stored for **five days** at refrigerated **2-8°C conditions**.

4130,That's a substantial drop in new cases by any standard.
4131,"I get that and mostly agree with that idea, however I know already we're going to get people talking about how we should ALL Lockdown because those of us who are more risk tolerant can spread it to people who don't want to get it."

4145,The offer was basically please buy more for the US otherwise we have to sell it to other countries first as they place their orders and we won't be able to make enough for the US for some time.
4146,"It's not so much an offer as saying ""Hey we live here, in the worst global hotspot and really want the US to get it's shit together."""
4147,Think of cruise ships

4149,Sometime in spring they said it was the leading vaccine and might be ready by October but now it's in third place if that
4150,A 90 year old grandmother getting vaccinated live on TV is a very powerful message to the overly cautious.
4151,Well done to her and to the NHS for getting this done.
4152,Perfectly rational to reserve in this manner at the beginning stages prior to more thorough studies on efficacy and especially unwanted effects being done.
4153,So hear me out.
4154,Would it be better to vaccinate those who are 18-35 first?
4155,"Covid can cause lifelong issues, if we vaccinate those who are 90+ years old they don't have long anyway....so imagine an 18 year old gets covid and has another 70 years of health complications vs a 90 year old who likely has less than 5-10 years."
4156,Just seems like an awful way to go about it.
4157,"&amp;#x200B;

4202,Hitting 100 Million vaccinations would be awesome!
4203,Especially considering we aren’t trying to eradicate COVID as deaths are very concentrated in high ages.
4204,We’d be very close to the end then!
4205,"I do think we will have that goal accomplished substantially by end of March, somewhere in the 80 million (Warp speed head’s low estimate if you account for his minimum of 20 million vaccinations each month) to 100 million (high estimate of 25 million)."

* 100 M Sanofi/GSK

Most require 2 doses, so halve those numbers."

4273,Pfizer can deliver at most 100 million doses (so enough for 50 million people) until the summer of 2021.

4275,Maybe 100 million people will be vaccinated at the end of the summer.

4322,"My sister does hospice and every day she's getting calls from recruiters all over the country, offering like $5k-$10k a week, with boarding stipend and sign on bonuses."
4323,It would be 3-8 times what she's making now but she's not taking them up because 1) she doesn't want to fucking die 2) she's worked in hospital settings and the 12 hour shifts are brutal and 3) she's not emotionally equipped for it.
4324,"Her whole job is death, bringing peace and dignity to the dying."
4325,Her company contracted with some local hospitals to take people off vents.

4345,Like... that's so fucked up that I'm amazed people think its remotely okay.
4346,Its disturbing.
4347,Sounds like they tried to cover their bases by reserving extra of different vaccines before initial study results started rolling out.
4348,It’s the only practical way to proceed given the situation.

4350,At least they acknowledge this is a final surge.

4369,Nope.

4394,"In the worst case, all the vaccines pan out, we have ten times the doses we need, and we can send them to the rest of the world."
4395,The problem is once the box is opened it can't really be shut.
4396,"No US president will say ""were not getting any more vaccine for a while but other countries are to make up for my predecessors illegal stuff""

It can be a policy that, if Trump actually makes this happen, can be quietly ended once other vaccines are in the market, but if Trump starts this most Americans won't accept a shortage."
4397,What if I get hit by a car tomorrow?
4398,Then this year was not a drop in the bucket for me.

4418,Attempts to call for abolishment of IP for the vaccines from developing countries in the UN and WHO has been consistently ignored (aside from Russia's Sputnik).
4419,"At the rate the west is hogging the vaccines and their IP, frankly put, even if the Vietnam vaccine won't be available till May next year, it would probably be faster and cheaper to cooperate with our neighbors and develop your own vaccines rather than waiting for the west to vaccinate their entire population."
4420,Considering Biden isn’t technically “President” yet - it’s evident they reading comprehension isn’t your strong suit.
4421,Exactly.
4422,Expect the unexpected.
4423,There were already manufacturing delays which dropped the number expected from 100 million down to 40 million.
4424,Half assed vaccination isn't helping anyone so 20 million is the correct answer.

4598,as I recall oxford was testing regularly for any infection while moderna and pfizer only tested if people showed symptoms.
4599,Oxford has said they hope their vaccine prevents all illness not just severe illness.
4600,Oxford has said they were in talks with the FDA and other countries to do a proper big study with the 1/2 dose and 1 full dose sequence &amp; were considering testing others.
4601,One theory why 1/2 dose followed by the full worked better was it mimics how infections usually occur from a small exposure which gives the immune system time to build up a proper response.
4602,"Hopefully the oxford 2 dose really does work because it was supposed to be easier to make, not just distribute and so they can increase production faster than the rna ones."
4603,At the moment I believe it's supply.
4604,Apparently when we open all our vaccination centres we'll be able to do over a million per week.
4605,Not necessarily.

you say that the 2B from the US government means this is a lie according to your interpretation."

4745,"That means the genetic payload of the virus, once through the cell membrane, can immediately trick the cellular mechanism to make amino acids &gt; proteins."
4746,It's extremely efficient and therefore nefarious.
4747,They also chose this method because it's fairly easy to synthesize.

4755,"""Harmful drinking among adults increases the longer they spend at home in lockdown, according to a study published in the peer-reviewed American Journal of Drug and Alcohol Abuse."
4756,"The research, based on a survey of nearly 2,000 over-18s in the US, is the first to highlight the relationship nationally between hazardous drinking and life stresses triggered by the COVID-19 pandemic and the associated 'lockdowns'."""
4757,"Except, thanks to the current US regime, you are not allowed in Canada."
4758,Oops.
4759,Private business might have to do something if the executive order impacts the interpretation of a specific law or regulation created by a regulatory body empowered by congress.
4760,My bet's on 10 years.

4764,"The only places giving out free groceries around me are churches, and they only give out groceries when I work."
4765,Living without a family as a support group and in a new areas is an absolute death sentence during this.
4766,"If you produced vaccines for a deadly virus, would you not vaccinate yourself and your staff?"
4767,"Well, yes."
4768,But that’s only if you consider that mitochondria is the powerhouse of the cell.
4769,No.
4770,"Moderna will deliver, sure."

4772,Someone forgot Norman Borlaug again.
4773,"While not unemployed, I've been out of work for a week and can't return to work for another 4-5 days, making a total of two weeks of work missed."
4774,"I won't get unemployment for AT LEAST 21 days, well after rent is do, setting me drastically behind, not to mention how the fuck am I supposed to buy groceries on top of all of this?"
4775,"Also, the hospital bills since my insurance isn't covering dick all because it doesn't start until the first of the year (and only after I make a 100$ payment)."
4776,"Being poor in this pandemic has been one of the most expensive things I've ever had to deal with and now I risk eviction because I got covid AT WORK because they aren't doing anything to keep us safe and covered but, oh boy, gotta keep that economy moving."
4777,This has single handedly made me lose all faith in this country (USA) and really has wrecked me financially (work in the service industry so work has been spotty at best with reduced hours and clientele).
4778,"And now I have the joy of not being able to afford Christmas and holiday cards, let alone presents this year... Oh boy, awesome."
4779,Is the vaccination rate limited by the supply to the UK or logistics within?
4780,2 million vaccinated people in 4-6 weeks is huge.
4781,We wish it was a vaccination against Trump
4782,This is very underrated.
4783,Trump is a loose cannon and could screw up their stocks a couple of times if they associate with him in anyway.
4784,Any pretty much anyone in this sub was decrying how ridiculous that was even in March.
4785,"I don't know if they were trying to stop a rush on masks or whether it's some weird Western superiority complex, but it was the biggest blunder they've made this entire pandemic."
4786,"See I don’t think that’s obvious, which is why I have a problem with it."
4787,Also that is definatley not how it was portrayed by the media at the time.
4788,They took it as an opportunity to slam dunk on trump when pence tried to claim credit (also wrong).
4789,There was no portrayal of the fact they were going to get $2B from the govt.
4790,Also where is the suggestion that I don’t think other governments did this coming from?
4791,I never said that and of course that happened and it’s good that it did.
4792,My only point is that pharma companies can’t then go on to pretend they did this without the benefits of Govt.
4793,assistance.
4794,These pre-orders are an example of govt.
4795,assistance which allows the companies to spend more than would normally be feasible.
4796,lol wut the fuck
4797,It works primarily on the level of social groups.
4798,"Schools will have large outbreaks a long time from now, for example."
4799,The problem is we have tied ourselves into a system of ethics that forces us to regard every life as having equal value.

4810,"No I’m not an anti masker, anti vaxxer, or gun wielding freedom fighter."
4811,"I think we need to respond to covid with better, less disruptive, and targeted solutions based off known risk factors for requiring hospitalizations."
4812,"We need better infection control policies in health care settings so we don’t spread this to patients in care homes/ long term care, because for them it’s deadly."
4813,For 20 year olds it’s not deadly at all.
4814,Maybe that also means quarantining those 70 and above until a vaccine is readily available.
4815,Isn’t that a much better solution than quarantining EVERYONE.
4816,Healthy people 50 and below are NOT increasing the strain on the health care system when they get covid.
4817,Give the vulnerable people the covid relief and send the kids to work.
4818,It’s not emotional for me to say covid lockdowns and policies have secondary effects on health that are real and dangerous.
4819,Your point number 1.
4820,Is not a separate issue and is my main area of contention.

4828,"There were two flu pandemics that had death totals that dwarf covid, the aids crisis, measles, polio, obesity, heart disease, that have all had a much more significant impact on human health."
4829,"Second, in no way is California’s approach measured."
4830,And in no way has it been.
4831,California implemented and enforced some of the strictest covid restrictions in the country and then when they let businesses try to get back on their feet they kicked their legs out from underneath them.
4832,And I’m sure you’ll respond “but the cases.” What about them?
4833,California as a state has less deaths per population than the majority of the rest of the world.
4834,"I guess I’ll ask the question back to you, what world do you live in where anything California has done has been a measured approach?"

4874,This is pretty much guaranteed
4875,1.
4876,I'm pretty sure I pointed out that there is a serious discussion to be had about the fact that state and federal governments have not been taking the measures to help people in need.
4877,That is a separate issue entirely from the pandemic.

4879,"People you know may rather die with family than alone in a hospital, that likely goes for most people, but they'd also probably prefer NOT DYING IN THE FIRST PLACE."

4883,4.
4884,"Hospital care has improved, but cases in states are getting out of hand regardless."
4885,ICU capacity in parts of my state was below 9% last that I checked.
4886,"As I mentioned earlier, care drops for everyone who ends up in the hospital when they're over burdened, which can still absolutely happen and is more than at any point in this pandemic likely to happen, possibly within a week  like in my state."
4887,"Hospitalizations peaked at about 60,000 before winter, the number hospitalized is over 100 000 and climbing."
4888,5.
4889,10000 college students means there's an unknown increase in odds that the 1000 people in carehomes catch it.
4890,"Or are you implying we quarantine the at risk population in direct contradiction of the whole ""people don't want to die alone"" thing?"
4891,"This to me is more proof you care little about the at risk population in the first place, and youre using the fact that they make up a relatively small part of the population to wave it aside."
4892,6.
4893,"There seems to be this insinuation that people are focused only on people getting infected, which as I point out in 1. is ridiculous if not an outright strawman."
4894,"I can't speak for others, but I personally see COVID having killed as many as it has as just one of the many teething problems this country has, including the very problems you mentioned."
4895,"Difference is, I believe there can be multiple solutions to multiple problems, problems more fundamental than shutting down for a month to save lives."
4896,"This ""a family losing everything or one old person dying"" has always been a bullshit false dichotomy by people who care more about their wealth or people falling for the propaganda."
4897,"We can save both, we just have to actually want that."
4898,But I'm gonna go out on a limb and guess the *actual* reason you're opposed to responding to COVID is political in nature.
4899,"Unfortunately good news tends to bring out the anti-vax crowd and also those who say stuff like ""I trust science but not this (scientifically tested and approved) vaccine""."
4900,There is also the contingent that want lockdown to last forever which may have negative feelings towards progress.
4901,Been doing this since March 👍
4902,No offense but when I see someone say you wish people would stay home it just makes my skin crawl.
4903,There are lots of people that would love to stay home.
4904,People seem to forget that not everyone has a nice job where they can work from home
4905,When I see names like this I wonder if it's a coincidence (William is a common name after all) or if it was a deliberate decision on his parents' part.
4906,"I mean, I’m going to get it, but... how will my employer know?"
4907,"What’s to stop someone from saying, “Yeah, I got it” when they actually didn’t...?"
4908,I’m not a conspiracy theorist type of guy but it seems shady to me if people have to carry around a Covid vaccine card.
4909,"Maybe shady isn’t the right word, I don’t know."
4910,Does anyone share a similar sentiment or am I just a weirdo
4911,This is completely wrong.

4916,"I'm not talking about protest, more like riots and people demanding medical treatment at gunpoint (2nd amendment 🐻 💪)"
4917,"Ah, yes."
4918,Just become a nurse.
4919,It's as simple as that.
4920,Tell me about it.
4921,First I heard the pandemic will be magically be over by April.
4922,Now it’s the general public will barely start getting them by April.
4923,Now it’s they’re not they can manufacture and ship and inoculate enough people by April in tier 1 by April.
4924,Plus the fact this vaccine is still not guaranteed to not have side effects or flaws.
4925,I hope your children and grandchildren then take it extremely seriously and work with you to come up with a plan.
4926,Your position is a very understandable one.
4927,But your kids and grandkids also don't want to watch you die through FaceTime on a phone or tablet.
4928,It's not just the dying part people face.
4929,"It's the horrific way it happens, not just passing in sleep."
4930,It makes me wonder what I would do if I had a parent or grandparent in an assisted living facility right now.
4931,The emotional part of me says I'd do whatever it took to get them out of their and into my home so I could safely interact with them.
4932,The logical part of me knows sometimes there's so much else going on and some people really do need the care.
4933,It's a horrible position all around.
4934,I don't judge you for the way you feel.
4935,But there's got to be a way to move through life with some precautions for all of this.
4936,Or maybe there was if spread was at reasonable levels and we as a society blew it by not doing everything we could to keep it there.
4937,I agree to a certain extent.
4938,Lockdowns are at a scale and we need to find a level where the measures dont cause more suffering in the long run.
4939,Its difficult though since the full negative effect wont be seen for decades.
4940,The positive effects of a lockdown are seen now.
4941,"For example closing schools are projected to cost children, especially poor children, in Norway about 1,4 million kroner per day."
4942,Closing down organised sports for children might mean that we will never get them back into sports.
4943,"Lockdowns causes drug abuse - which leads to more crime, overdoses and unemployment etc"
4944,That would be the least NHS thing possible.

4989,The elderly are shuffled away for a price then taken care of by undertrained and underpaid people who are usually only in that profession because no one else will do it while the company/home soaks up all the profits

4992,If Finns are criticizing a Swedish strategy then there must have been a lot to criticize about.
4993,It's my understanding that states and local governments don't actually have the legal capability to run at a deficit like the federal government does.
4994,But also a lot of it is pure politics.
4995,They may not be able to do a full lockdown but I'm not sure any state is actually doing everything they could feasibly doing due to the political battle of it all.

5020,1st week of February I rode BART into the city to go to a museum.
5021,Ate ice cream indoors got in an Uber it was a total rush.
5022,And meanwhile most of the peeps I was talking with about Covid thought I was being an alarmist.
5023,Even my kiwi elder thought I was nuts for making him use hand sanitizer after the Bart and before eating and again after getting in the Uber and Bart again.
5024,I was too self conscious to put on the mask I had stashed in my bag.
5025,"I thought you were making some reference I was OOTL on, but that really is his name!"
5026,How do you know they’re already vaccinated?
5027,For me personally this is the one thing I’ve avoided since my last bar night in Feb.
5028,I came to the conclusion I would let my body take nice long break during Covid from alcohol.
5029,But even prior I wasn’t a big drinker but still once a week was enough for me .
5030,Hospital medical labs are chronically understaffed.
5031,I broke down crying every month at least due to the stress and workload.
5032,This was even before COVID.
5033,"There are good labs around, but they are never hiring."
5034,This republican (even if by registration only) has since February of this year.
5035,It's the kind of madness that makes you almost want to suffer through running for office just to get somebody competent in place.
5036,Never should something as simple as wearing masks and social distancing have become a political battleground.
5037,I can understand the arguments for freedom and economics associated with lockdowns but to wear masks and distance from one another costs nothing.

5053,How is there any way the Oxford vaccine can be approved given that phase 3 trials were messed up?

5063,"He spent months sending federal agents to intercept shipments of tests and ppe that had been purchased by various states, seize the shipments without compensating the state governments, and redirect them to centralized warehouses at undisclosed locations to be resold back to the states by his buddies in the private sector."
5064,It got so bad that states started using police escorts or smuggling ppe to keep it from being seized.
5065,Robert Kraft used the Patriots team plane to fly masks into Boston because it was the only way to get the ppe into hospitals and keep it out of the feds’ hands.
5066,"A government that would steal needed medical supplies from its own people is not going to hesitate to use some shady, extra-legal bullshit to screw over other countries."
5067,Agreed.
5068,Let’s wait this out guys.
5069,So what if it is lazy parents?
5070,The kids should just suffer then?
5071,"Also single parents, essential jobs, jobs that don’t allow WFH."
5072,It’s great it works for you but for many it won’t
5073,True.
5074,I believe it was Rhode Island that built an outdoor space to handle hospitalized patients but didn’t have any staff left to station it.
5075,Something completely unmanageable like 1 doctor for every 50 patients and 25 for every nurse.
5076,"4 million doses of Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine for UK until the end of year, 7 million doses for Germany until the end of March Pfizer + Moderna combined."
5077,EU has placed its bets on the Oxford vaccine.
5078,He did lose the popular vote.
5079,"Was looking at CDC data ""weekly deaths by state and cause of death"", and am finding that when I sum up the past 6 years of deaths (2015-&gt;2020), I get a crazy high number like 50 million."
5080,"Which, doesn't seem right ... right?"
5081,Am I not consuming this data correctly?
5082,Source on ‘every possible category’?
5083,The UK has started vaccinating the elderly and hcw.
5084,The US will probably be doing the same this Friday.
5085,Lets hope this will finally be the beginning of the end of this pandemic.
5086,UK doesn’t require people to wear gloves when giving shots?
5087,Yes of course.
5088,The point is it’s a nuanced issue.
5089,I’ll be crying when you guys get side effects or die from the vaccine
5090,Possibly the stupidest thing I've ever read on Reddit.
5091,It’s weird because all the kids I know are just in daycare now or going to school to be babysat by non teacher staff while teachers work remotely.
5092,"So all my friends kids and my nephew are in person, in large group settings with other kids and teacher (they’re just daycare teachers)"
5093,Because mind is a social phenomenon rather than an individual one.
5094,I wish you all the best 😢 Hopefulky it will be better under Biden but that fact so many parts of the government failed to allow it to get so bad is pretty shocking
5095,Margaret Keenan
5096,Gonna check back in 6 months to see the side effects
5097,&gt; .so imagine an 18 year old gets covid and has another 70 years of health complications vs a 90 year old who likely has less than 5-10 years.
5098,This may have been a very valid point if it wasn't for the fact that people who are 90+ are *much* more likely to straight up die because of covid than 18-35 year olds are to get lifelong health complications.
5099,"Vaccinating the oldest (which is a smaller group and therefore requires fewer vaccine doses) first also means that there will be less pressure on hospitals, which benefits younger people who get sick."
5100,Germany has a huge club scene.
5101,What about divorced parents whose new partners' parents themselves divorced and got new partners?

5106,"tribalism when certain people made masks and other precautions a wedge issues instead of ""does this have a scientific basis"" issue."
5107,But that should be my choice.
5108,"If I want to take the precautions to have a child based on my situation and believe the risk of her getting Covid is less than unknown effects of a vaccine, I should be able to do that."
5109,What will certainly happen is in Geography when you do country analysis and look at the demographic pyramid of countries having mishandled Covid.
5110,The onion will look far thinner at the top and bottom and the overall population shrunk because there were less births.
5111,The AZ United States arm doesn't contain the 1.5 dose that got the possibly good result.
5112,That has to be set up from scratch as the .5 was the first shot.
5113,"The existing AZ trial with the results, besides the error, doesn't meet FDA criteria for authorization."
5114,The articles about her crimes that I saw got pulled by the moderators back in May when she first made news.
5115,Basically it was just stuff with an ex-boyfriend.
5116,I think it was a stalking charge and a restraining order.
5117,Personal life stuff that was not relevant to her job performance.
5118,"That said, I was impressed with her understanding of the Florida data and how nuanced difference in the calculation can lead to vastly different results ( i.e."

5126,"The person is in isolation."""

5148,Nah.

5170,Just build a Trump statue and add the obligatory text.
5171,Just like [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q52EnHo4r7U) gag when Carter was considered the worst Post War president.
5172,"Huh, guess so"
5173,This could be the motto of the Trump Era: We had plenty of stupid.
5174,"As many non-US western nations all came together and agreed to do, such as Canada, the EU, etc."
5175,So what will happen to this sub after almost everyone gets the vaccine ?

5188,"Frankly to me, eating out is more so about the experience of sitting and chatting with friends/family rather than prepping a meal, and then not having to worry about clean up at all."
5189,I highly value the experience and trade off of dollars vs. Time.
5190,"Certainly not every day, or every week, but man going to a restaurant for a nice meal with friends is probably the #1 thing I miss."
5191,"50 vaccination centres, 7 days a week for 6 weeks would need to vaccinate 950 people a day to hit 2 million."

5193,Seems tight but certainly not impossible.
5194,Certainly easier as more centres come online.
5195,This is the perfect start for the 2021 Zombie Apocalypse.

5209,"Yes this, put well"
5210,I’m a nurse in the US.
5211,What’s surprising to me is how many of my coworkers are adamant about not getting the vaccine when I didn’t even let my supervisor finish asking me before I said yes.
5212,They’re all worried about “long term effects” and how it “shouldn’t be possible to have a vaccine this quickly”.
5213,Needless to say I don’t share their sentiments and am profoundly disappointed in their decision.

5229,Thank you.
5230,"Oh nevermind, I think China has another one that is a lot cheaper."
5231,And then the Oxford vaccine that is going to be manufactured in India is gonna be cheap too
5232,I beg to differ.
5233,"If that is the case, how come news reports are saying he will sign an executive order preventing shipment of vaccine to international countries before U.S. have enough?"
5234,At current situation it looks like they have been caught with their pants down and trying to rectify the situation.
5235,I would have no problem getting it but the problem in the USA is that it may take until next summer before there is adequate quantity of vaccine available to inoculate everyone.
5236,Hey CANADA can I get a travel exemption for a vaccine shot?
5237,Well China and Russia started a couple months ago...
5238,"In two days, US meets, reviews, and more than likely issues EUA to get the ball rolling."

5246,Could you link some previous articles about her actions/history that indicate she committed a crime or could have possibly done something wrong to warrant the recent actions of the police/government ?
5247,The 10 priority groups identified should prevent most of the deaths occuring and these groups should hopefully be vaccinated by end of Jan/Feb.
5248,After that it's a case of mass rollouts to the 18-60 age groups with no underlying conditions which could take another few months but be significantly quicker if the vaccines which don't require deep cold storage get approved.
5249,Watching it from the inside is likewise insane...

5295,They can’t be at risk if their not alive yet.
5296,In my age range the chance of death is .01% if I even get Covid.
5297,Same with my wife.
5298,But what is the chance the vaccine could effect our pregnancy in some way.
5299,Even if it’s a 1% chance I’m not risking it.
5300,Anyone at higher risk in my family will be getting a vaccine

The reason I would consider it ‘support’ is because of the guaranteed nature of it."
5345,If the deal was that if you’re vaccines aren’t used you don’t get the money then I wouldn’t consider it support.
5346,What makes me think of it as support is the fact that as long as they produce an approved vaccine they get the money.
5347,I would argue that makes it distinct from buying the vaccines because they might end up paying billions to companies even though their vaccines weren’t needed or used.

5384,Wearing masks indoors should have been done just out of common courtesy for your fellow man.

5447,100s of 1000s of people lining the streets.
5448,In your opinion as someone Covid recovered with anti bodies should I get the vaccine?
5449,Is there a benefit?
5450,There are still some things we don’t know.
5451,"I hesitate to call them risks, as I am not a scientist and only have a passable understanding of the research literature I’ve read."
5452,I’ve included a detailed description of what I’ve recently read about mRNA vaccines to do my best to explain why I think some folks might be hesitant.
5453,mRNA vaccines have been researched for three decades now.
5454,"They’re being explored as possible ways to vaccinate against rapidly-evolving viruses such as HIV, which historically poses a vaccination problem because of the speed at which it mutates."
5455,mRNA vaccines are well-suited to solve this kind of problem because they can be developed and manufactured rather quickly.
5456,"In fact, one of the mRNA vaccines we will have soon (Moderna, IIRC) was developed the week after China had sequenced the COVID-19 genome (so back in January or February)."
5457,"Moderna is one of the firms that has been actively researching and testing mRNA vaccines for other applications, so it’s not surprising that they were able to strike early."
5458,"Other applications of mRNA vaccines being explored include vaccinating against Ebola or even certain cancers, both of which I think are really cool."
5459,"All that said, most of these research is in very early stages - animal trials or stage 1 human clinical trials."
5460,It is my understanding that these are trials that mostly test initial efficacy (does it work to vaccinate against the intended pathogen?)
5461,rather than long term results and safety.
5462,And herein lies the rub.
5463,"We are in such a crisis at the moment that we did the clinical trials for these drugs in a different, more rapid way."
5464,"We are also approving these vaccines for release without the typical 2-year post-trial period, which I understand to be important for evaluating long-term immunity and safety."
5465,That makes some people uncomfortable.
5466,"They are used to hearing that drugs take years to be approved (and some still have terrible side effects), but now we have multiple vaccines in less than a year, two of which use a totally new approach not used beyond early-stage clinical trials."
5467,"I was taking with a friend yesterday and she shared her skepticism for an mRNA vaccine because she thought it was changing her DNA (which it isn’t, and I explained that to her)."
5468,"People are generally wary of anything new, particularly if they don’t understand it."
5469,It’s not so much that there are defined risks other than the unknown.
5470,"THAT said, there are a few things we definitively don’t know about mRNA vaccines:

* How long will the immunity they convey last?"
5471,* Are there any long-term side effects?
5472,"Here’s what we DO know about the risks of mRNA vaccines:

* They can cause some post-injection side effects, including fever and other cold-like symptoms."
5473,"Most were mild, some were more severe."
5474,"(This is a risk with any vaccine, but I mention it because the trials themselves mention it.)"
5475,"All that said, I *personally* don’t find the “what if?” risks of an mRNA vaccine to outweigh the very real risks of COVID."
5476,"From what I have read, it seems like the theoretical future risks (immunity, side effects) would be the same with any other vaccine being developed, and I would still rather take my chances with that than with COVID."
5477,I hope this answers your question.
5478,Happy to clarify if it doesn’t.
5479,Unfortunately so many current articles about Coronavirus infection rates are like that.
5480,"And meanwhile, there's still seems to be a significant amount of people still ignoring mask and distancing suggestions."
5481,Not looking forward to the horror in the January articles.
5482,Thank you.
5483,Many people have already given up 9 months with seemingly little pushback.
5484,Look at what's happening in parts of California right now with the extreme lockdowns.
5485,"Sure, some complaints, but most are accepting it."
5486,"If the government outright said another year, there might be mass public uprisings."
5487,"However, they're stringing people along with assurances of a few more weeks of various restrictions, which then continues to get extended."
5488,"Recall early on, it was touted as just 2 weeks / 15 days to slow the spread."
5489,"Fast-forward to nearly 9 months later and lockdowns, restrictions, etc still continuing."
5490,Goalposts moving further and further out.
5491,If you're referring to individuals waiting out vaccination leading to delays in opening.
5492,I doubt few will factor that into their decision making.
5493,"When push comes to shove, most people will consider their own safety first."
5494,"Also, I doubt it's going to matter, regardless..."
5495,"Even assuming most are vaccinated by Fall 2021, that's leading into annual cold and flu season."
5496,So it's likely health officials will play it safe and advocate for continued restrictions into the warmer months of 2022.
5497,It was in Ireland!
5498,I’m proud
5499,"&gt;I keep hearing about privilege, but it just doesn't seem like privilege exists where you claim it does."
5500,"In fact, it seems like the exact opposite."
5501,By this statement you actually seem to be suggesting it's easier to be black in America than white?
5502,How insanely out of touch could you possibly be?
5503,Yeah it seems that way.
5504,I think the question is if they didn't have those orders and the vaccine did work.
5505,Would they have any issues selling a vaccine during a pandemic?
5506,"It's kinda like sellling food to a starving man, not a hard sell."
5507,There are multiple studies that show significant undercounts based on antibody studies.
5508,Usually around 5x depending on when in the pandemic
5509,except insurance is a competitive market and multiple other insurance entities could then bid for the companies account without such strict requests
5510,Eh I’ll think about it
5511,"And if the rest of the country had done the same, there probably would have been a nice several month stretch over the summer where we could have safely gone back to doing things"
5512,I'm not a vaccine specialist (vaccinologist?)
5513,but when will we know the efficiency of the vaccine under normal circumstances?
5514,AFAIK the efficiency was tested with ppl still practicing social distancing/masks/etc.. Plus I imagine the ppl that actually volunteered for the trial are more concerned with science and more likely to hear to the specialist's recommendations than your average Joe.
5515,"I'm not trying to be a smartass or anything, just wondering how things go from now on."
5516,Any updates for melatonin uses as prevention and treatment?
5517,FDA is meeting on Thursday so they'll either approve it same day or early next week.
5518,I'd say by the end of next week we should ywve started rolling out hopefully.
5519,Us won't be too far behind the UK in terms of vaccine roll out
5520,Yep!
5521,Very excited about that
5522,Yes
5523,Didn’t Jesus say that closing the door and praying in private was better than praying in public like the hypocrites do?
5524,insurance providers straight up don’t have leverage for that.
5525,OP is at best naive and at worst dangerously ignorant because they see a narrative that fits their worldview.
5526,Any insurance company that tried to pull this would immediately be undercut by a competitor that didn’t have such strict requirements.
5527,But at 90+ hope she gets it soon.
5528,We'll likely give our first doses as soon as Friday
5529,This kinda explains the Oxford vaccine results.
5530,"The 62% efficacy seems consistent with a single dose, and probably the second dose doesn’t do much because of vector immunity."
5531,It is said that Dec 27 was decided to also to celebrate Louis Pasteur's birthday along with his discoveries and contributions to diseases prevention.
5532,I just hope this isn’t all too good to be true and this thing only turns for the worse.

5569,And hospitalisations is at record high now.

5571,Shit is bad.

5576,Uk authorized pfizer for emergency use few days ago.
5577,China and UAE allowed emergency use of Sinovac few months ago.

5579,I hope your headache went away
5580,Lol nothing!!

5584,Ok mate
5585,Wow!
5586,"We have 3 waffle houses just in my area, so I’m definitely not a stranger to them 😂"
5587,"The half-dose/full-dose trial will not impact the current timeline, even if they successfully find a large pool of volunteers, the other vaccines will slow down spread to the point where efficacy data can no longer be generated within a few moths."
5588,"But they already have a full/full dose in the USA underway, best guess for proving efficacy is early next year, and they should apply to the FDA after that (unless the FDA break precedent and agree to look at data from other nations, in which case they can apply right now with the full/full part of their original trial.)"
5589,Yeah I think that’s where the difference arises.
5590,Seems like everyone else doesn’t consider those purchase orders to be a form of support whereas I would consider it to be.

In contrast, in April 2001, the company’s internal intention-to-treat analyses of pooled data from these 2 trials identified a significant increase in total mortality (hazard ratio [HR], 4.43; 95% CI, 1.26-15.53 for protocol 091, and HR, 2.55; 95% CI, 1.17-5.56 for protocol 078), with overall mortality of 34 deaths among 1069 rofecoxib patients and 12 deaths among 1078 placebo patients (HR, 2.99; 95% CI, 1.55-5.77)."

5662,There has been some speculation that governments are looking at a way for third parties to securely identify whether a person has been vaccinated.

5707,This ALL needed to happen across the country.
5708,"The reason is simple, this stops the community viral transmission and stops new cases from entering the country."
5709,You effectively create a barrier between the rest of the COVID world and the US general population.
5710,"This was obviously not trivial, and we as a country failed to stay home enough which means in certain areas we still had community spread, and those people can freely travel anywhere in the US."

5715,So the only option left was mitigation.

5720,"This is why so many people were panicking back in January and February, like my wife and I, because we saw what was happening first in China then in Italy, then we saw cases start to spread in Washington state and NYC, we knew shit was fucked."
5721,That's why we prepped like hell because our lives depended on it.
5722,"I would imagine many people also saw the writing on the wall as well, and have basically isolated ourselves as much as possible since March until everyone is vaccinated."
5723,We learned that the WHO and CDC weren't necessarily being 100% honest when they said masks were not necessary at the beginning despite common sense and studies from decades of experience in Asia.
5724,"We learned that we can't necessarily count on the political leadership of this country to protect our family, and we confirmed our belief that many Americans are so selfish and divided we won't do even the basics of caring for each other if it meant any inconvenience to themselves."
5725,"&gt; BioNTech/Pfizer - 95% efficacy, 3.8% fatigue, 2% headache, other grade 3 side effects are below 2%
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Moderna - 94.1% efficacy, 9.7% fatigue, 4.5% headache, 8.9% muscle pain, 5.2% joint pain
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Oxford - 62%(70%) efficacy, systemic symptoms in ~76% of participants of phase 2 trial
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Oxford vaccine is 2-3 leagues below competitors."
5726,"&gt;HIV is within striking distance, especially with mRNA vaccines

HIV never became a great threat to mankind like we feared in the 80s and 90s."
5727,"It ended up affecting mostly: drug addicts, non-heterosexuals, sub-saharan Africa, haemophiliacs."
5728,Even Hep B shot is not routinely given to infants everywhere in the world.
5729,"Cancer vaccines, for the affluent world at least, will be incredible."
5730,Same with any vaccine for mosquito carrying disease like malaria or a better dengue vaccine than what we have today that could be taken by anyone.

5736,*
5737,Thanks.
5738,Hugs to you too.
5739,This year is  tough for everyone honestly.
5740,Congrats to the West Wing family.
5741,Only a few more weeks before you can breath fresh air.
5742,The excitement will stay.
5743,"Everyday, you're exposed to enough who have the virus now, and when released, for you lucky few, you'll transition into settings just like WW."
5744,"Because you're publicly known, we can all see how long the immunity lasts across the age spectrum."
5745,Thank you for your service.
5746,Merry XMas.
5747,That’s a pretty dumb statement.
5748,I’m just highlighting that when it comes to covid there are more people at risk of a bad outcome than people often think.
5749,"If someone is obese it doesn’t mean they will die of covid, just like if they are over 70 it isn’t necessarily a death sentence, but the risk factor goes up and those people are more likely to need hospitalization, etc."
5750,"I’m just pointing out that your solution of quarantining all those at risk, which would be great if it could be done, isn’t practical as too many people, plus their households, would need to be quarantined for a long period of time and it’s likely that if there is a lot of virus in the community many of these people could still be infected."
5751,Your argument that lockdowns do a lot of harm to society is 100% correct.
5752,They do.
5753,Both financially and from a mental health perspective.
5754,It’s just that trying to quarantine those at risk while letting the virus rip through the community isn’t a viable solution.
5755,"In my view, what should be done is there should be sufficient financial aid to assist those that need to quarantine and are impacted financially by the pandemic."
5756,The US is not a poor country and could provide this type of assistance but has failed to do so.
5757,Where I am (Australia) the government introduced a lot financial assistance for most businesses and individuals when the pandemic hit.
5758,"If a business’ turnover was impacted (down 30% or more) they could receive $1,500 per fortnight for every employee to pass on to them."
5759,Other taxes were held off as well.
5760,Individuals who lost their job could get a similar amount from the government.
5761,A lot of this assistance is still ongoing here but to a lesser degree (because a lot of the country is back to normal due to low or non-existent covid).
5762,"In Victoria (the state that had an outbreak and went into lockdown) there was additional financial aid including $450 to stay at home while you waited for a test and also $1,500 for needing to stay at home if you had covid or needed to look after a family member and didn’t have income because of it."
5763,Obviously it still isn’t a great scenario but helping people financially reduces a lot of stress and mental anxiety.
5764,What would be a worse outcome?
5765,Having covid out of control and not knowing if you’ll infect your loved ones or if people you love will still be here this time next year.
5766,"In addition to some of the other comments here (which hit the nail on the head, in my opinion), I'd also like to quote a comment by /u/HoosierGirl29 posted on /r/COVID19:

""As u/PiratoPickles mentioned, Francois Balloux (@BallouxFrancois) of UCL did a tweet thread about this earlier this week."
5767,"The short version is that there are claims that the spike protein sequence contains homologous bits of syncytin-1, which is used in human placenta development."
5768,Their argument is that there's a possibility the vaccine could induce antibodies against syncytin-1.
5769,A simple BLAST analysis of the S protein sequence and syncytin-1 shows that they're a *whopping 11% similar.
5770,* The longest stretch of overlapping amino acids that I see off-hand is 3.
5771,"If our bodies formed antibodies against sequences that were 11% homologous, we'd probably be extinct as a human race by now."""
5772,"(emphasis mine)

Just to give you context, when we consider sequence similarity for proteins to assess whether they're conserved or structurally similar, we typically say that there's a possible evolutionary relationship between two domains if they have at least a 20% similarity over a large stretch of the domain or protein."
5773,"11% is comically low (although I haven't personally independently run the BLAST myself) -- if it is that low, I would go so far as to say it is actively dishonest to call them ""analogous proteins"" such that we have to worry about a problem there."
5774,"Finally, it's important to remember -- if this is an effect of the vaccine (which, again, is absolutely unlikely), then it would also likely be an effect of the virus itself (and there is zero evidence of that)."

5779,"&gt;I'm all in favor of keeping masks permanently required in healthcare centers, public transit, government offices, pharmacies, and grocery/general stores specifically so we don't suffer tons of flu deaths/disabilities every fucking year in the US anymore."
5780,"You're basically telling the hearing impaired to get bent, but continue to go off."
5781,I guess.
5782,Cyber brigading etc has worked well for them.
5783,"It’s not a criticism, *per se,* more of an expression of concern."
5784,"Ahhh, that makes more sense!"
5785,&gt; The previous vaccines like polio were designed to elicit an immuno response by injecting small amounts of virus into the host which is different from the current vaccine vehicle technology.
5786,"Well, they were to be fair attenuated by passaging through cell cultures or other animals to introduce mutations/deletions that reduce their pathogenicity (or, in case of inactivated vaccines, use the real virus particles, but inactivate them using chemicals or gamma rays)."
5787,Oh no!
5788,It’s really not.
5789,Acute renal failure can easily be corrected with fluids.
5790,There is a good chance you have had acute renal failure in your lifetime.
5791,Renal failure doesn’t mean you lose a kidney and you have to start dialysis.
5792,"Ok, go on google and do some research, I don’t work for  you."
5793,The Covenant of Good Faith Exemption that you are referring to means employers can’t fire someone in order to avoid paying retirement benefits or fire a salesperson to avoid paying earned commissions or a bad faith reason like that.
5794,"It doesn’t mean employers have to provide a reason, they don’t."
5795,It’s also not “most states” it’s 11 states that recognize the Covenant of Good Faith Exemption.
5796,"On any case, none of that will matter at all."
5797,"If employers decide to make Covid vaccination a term of employment, they will be required to make ADA accommodations, perhaps religions exceptions, but by and large, as the law stands now, they will legally be allowed to do so."
5798,"And to reiterate, I’m not trying to convince you, feel free to believe whatever you want."
5799,So the above statement is wrong right?
5800,But then why would 2 experts say such a thing?
5801,"I mean everyone makes mistakes but still, it doesnt look like you can make such a mistake on accident."
5802,I would like all the trailers that are being used as make shift morgues to have ‘COVID-19 Mobile Morgue’ printed on the side as it goes to and from hospitals to get people’s attention.
5803,"That is the official number, but the pharmacies only started their testing in late summer, which freedom up the counties to test everybody and not just those who were already displaying symptoms."
5804,I had 3 different direct exposures at work between March and August.
5805,I was not able to meet the qualifications for testing.
5806,"So think of all the people who couldn't get testing while the tests were being hoarded, and then think about all the people who chose to not get tested after displaying symptoms."
5807,And then all the people who never became symptomatic.
5808,We will never the true number of infected and it is scary to even consider the implications of how many cases we missed.
5809,"😥 - nah, I'll shed not a tear for thee."
5810,😀
5811,I can read and I've done plenty of research and had plenty of conversations on the issue.
5812,You really think a vaccine is unsafe because you'll get really tired?

6025,Any test on the ground is a pound
6026,Telling the Russians not to drink alcohol is like telling our leader not to send out a Tweet.
6027,Typing to fast and autocorrect lol
6028,"Considering how new the vaccine is, this appears to be based on a person's opinion that the immunosuppressant tendencies of alcohol will register the vaccine ineffective."
6029,Seems like mandating 8 hours of sleep would be a similar suggestion.
6030,I'm just wondering if they're looking for a way to blame Russian people if their rushed vaccine isn't as effective as hoped.
6031,No government is going to lockdown again once a significant portion of deaths have been avoided.
6032,For all intents and purposes it's pandemic over and back to normal life for the vast majority of people.
6033,Yes there could still be a few who will have lasting consequences but it's pretty much acceptable losses.
6034,100% agree with your thought process.
6035,More older women.
6036,More women working frontline.
6037,Skews stats at first glance making you think women are more susceptible but the reality is a higher population of that age bracket to infect.
6038,"As you suggest, I believe when further analysis is shown we will see that on a per population ratio, men will show more severe infections even though it seems like less were infected."

6043,*
6044,I am a health care worker and I have never been tested for Covid even when I showed up to work with a very minor sore throat and a cough.
6045,They said you don't have a fever so you're good to work and to also to makes sure I wore my mask.
6046,Since half my department was furloughed I had no choice but to go to work.
6047,"From the very beginning, they could have recommending cloth fabric masks to save PPE for medical professionals, instead of saying ""ALL masks are ineffective"" like we are sheep that can be lied into submission."
6048,It's a huge blunder that really hurt CDC's credibility.
6049,The timeline will be the same because we still will have tons of doses from other candidates too.
6050,Vaccine trial participant here.
6051,Moderna vaccine.
6052,"First 2 days suck, but the symptoms subside quickly."
6053,"Then they should send next day letters, they should send texts, emails."
6054,Heck create an online portal to allow people to fill it out based on an access code texted or mailed to people.
6055,Doing the same thing over and over again is not going to change the outcomes.
6056,"They also have the same population as California, so just a few hundred million less than the US."
6057,I meant to say does it affect fertility?
6058,Sorry if I was not clear.
6059,PS: Not trolling.
6060,Genuine question.
6061,Title = jizz quiz
6062,"Sadly, this probably won’t happen partially because of the administration not doubling up on ordering more vaccines in the summer."
6063,Pfizer is claiming that there won’t be substantial supply for the US until June or July
6064,"Well recently their projections have gone on three tracks, making them meaningless."
6065,And prior to that change IHME was criticized for being optimistic.
6066,But the doses just aren’t there to expect this thing to be gone before next summer.
6067,If for no other reason than there are not more than 100 million doses to come to the states before the summer.
6068,That means 50 million vaccinated.
6069,That number is nowhere near herd immunity.
6070,And that’s assuming the most at risk groups accept two doses of a vaccine that gets them a little sick after the first one.
6071,There is NOTHING to suggest widespread American compliance with the vaccination regimen.
6072,"That’s not to say those who die next summer didn’t get exactly what they asked for, but the people I trust say next summer to next fall things will approach normal."
6073,I’m not being pessimistic.
6074,The doses and the compliance just aren’t where they need to be to wipe this thing out before August/September.
6075,And even then it will still be infecting people around the world and in the US.
6076,"Remember when we were panicked with 40,000 new cases a day?"
6077,"Well, we’re ~6x that now."
6078,"Will we be okay when things are back to 40,000 cases a day?"
6079,Probably not because we won’t have reached herd immunity.
6080,That means the growth could return to exponential as soon as we pretend it’s dealt with.
6081,Somebody should start being honest with the public.
6082,Our press has done a dismal job.
6083,Reddit is becoming a site for wishful misinformation and people are dying as a result.
6084,"Yeah, I see where you're at."
6085,"I see it as if you get covid you have 1% (?, depends) of dying, a bigger chance of being sick for a long time and a good chance of passing it onto someone else who will also die."
6086,"They tested it on 30,000 people."
6087,"If 300 of those died, that would be a wash. None of them (AFAIK died), so it's a bigger risk to not get the vaccine."
6088,"It's like wearing a seatbelt in a car - if your car crashes, you're knocked unconscious and it catches fire, you'd have been better off being thrown through the windshield."
6089,"But 99.9% of the time, you're better off wearing a seatbelt."
6090,(Or flying vs driving for me.
6091,"Driving a long way is objectively much more likely to kill me than flying in a plane, but the plane still makes me a smidge nervous, and the car doesn't)."
6092,And almost all of them will be fine.

6105,How do you end up spelling 'dose' wrong 2 different ways in one comment?
6106,"What's worst is they said ""SURGICAL masks are ineffective, unproven scientifically"" to recommending CLOTH fabric masks which are obviously inferior to surgical masks."
6107,There is even less evidence for cloth masks too.
6108,"Also, border closures were considered ""Racist"" at the time."
6109,Identity politics basically flubbed the initial response in the west.
6110,This is comforting but it’s still conjecture.
6111,I wish they could really focus on this issue because I’m not the only woman who is concerned.
6112,"If I have no more pregnancies, I’d like it to be my choice and not because I can’t make a healthy placenta anymore."
6113,I’ve had zero fertility issues to now.
6114,"""1 in 8 Americans currently work in the medical profession."
6115,"That’s ~40 million?"""
6116,I just want to point out that there are ballpark 20mil in the medical profession according to the cdc/bls.
6117,Im not saying your 1 in 8 is wrong but guess is its one of eight currently employeed or one of eight people in the working age population which would get you alot close to 20 million.
6118,So that being said you can vaccinate 20 million of the highest risk demographic right away.
6119,So let's just assume all healthcare workers will get it first and work from there.
6120,I literally don't care.
6121,"I don't need you telling me what to do when you live in a country smaller than Colorado, whether you have to deal with this stupid virus or not."
6122,"Congrats on having a competent government, don't try to use it to tell me what to do though."
6123,That comes Thursday.
6124,This is basically an advisory group to the FDA recommending that FDA approve the vaccine.
6125,The FDA actually votes on Thursday after considering this recommendation and whatever other data they're receiving.
6126,What?
6127,I can't tell if this story is just being sensational or is actually reporting on something that is worth outrage.
6128,"Similarly, I can't tell if comments in defense of this missed opportunity are made to make Trump look better or are actually objective and true."
6129,"Even further, I can't tell if the outrage comments are warranted or are exaggerated because of Trump."
6130,"The politics of this situation makes finding the truth incredibly difficult and even when I am staring truth in the face, I'm not sure I can recognize it."
6131,Say you spray a jacket with waterproof material.
6132,And then you spray water all over that jacket.
6133,"The jacket itself does not get wet; however, if you shake the jacket out all of that water will then spray around and get everything around it wet."
6134,"In the same way, after vaccination your body may not affect you with the virus but if you have it and you're shedding the virus you can still infect others."
6135,My concern lately is what if taking this vaccine ends up being an unnecessary risk due to the virus mutating.
6136,"It is already known that most animals can be infected and it certainly didn't take long for it to go from human to animal back to human with the minks, so how long until this happens with other animals but actually mutates to the degree the vaccine isn't effective."
6137,I'm not saying I wont take it or fear mongering I just genuinely have been thinking how I would hate to risk long term effects for nothing.
6138,I think people just don't answer the phone for unfamiliar numbers
6139,"If by “mess up” you mean the spinal SAV, that wasn’t found to be related to the vaccine"
6140,"and then ""The Great Hack"" or search for Steve Bannon and Roger Stone"
6141,"politics doesnt work that way... it def can be hold against some party that plays ""lottery"" with taxmoney."
6142,"in hindsight it looks like a snapdecision, but odds were def against a viable vaccine in record-time."
6143,Some people really do seem to thrive on doom.
6144,This is a deadly virus to the very old and very sick.
6145,"Once most of the very old and very sick are vaccinated, the threat overwhelmed hospitals - the ENTIRE justification for these lockdowns/restrictions - ends."
6146,And so must the lockdowns/restrictions.
6147,"This post appears to be about vaccines, please see [our FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/wiki/faq#wiki_where_can_i_find_information_about_the_mechanism_and_progress_of_vaccines.3F) for answers to frequently asked questions regarding the COVID-19 vaccines."

6152,Cyber stalking charges check out.
6153,Tbh I don’t really know.
6154,"We were all hoping that my mom would be able to get the vaccine ASAP because she is immunocompromised with an autoimmune disease and an essential worker and older, but her doctor recently informed her that she wouldn’t be able to take any of the covid vaccines which was super disappointing for us."
6155,Now we have to wait for herd immunity and covid numbers to kick in.
6156,"Sorry I don’t have a better answer :(

Edit: briefly looked into it and it looks like the immunocompromised are not included in the initial vaccine trials with pregnant women and children."
6157,So their safety is unknown and for the time being she won’t be able to take it.
6158,Hopefully it’s safe!
6159,"Unless the placebo group drop out, as is their right."
6160,What purpose does a placebo group serve now that efficacy has been strongly proven?
6161,Dose the placebos and follow them for duration of immunity and side effect data.
6162,"I've never seen this level of autism in my life,

6163,"What Giuliani had everybody has, he spreads boogers and sweat like social media spreads their fake news."
6164,It's all over his face and all over the place.
6165,I will frame it in a funny way.
6166,"In 2020, when we had a reality tv star in the oval office the side events were murder hornets, race protests, forest fires, and other chaos."
6167,Then we elected a nice boring politician and the weird stuff became monoliths popping up around the world and a LifeTime movie about Harland Sanders funded by KFC.
6168,Keep politics boring is the lesson.
6169,So can we go out 10 days after the first dose?
6170,basically every time I turn my air purifier off in my apartment.
6171,I'm more interested in the daily figure of vaccinations
6172,"Both men and women are able to have kids, but only women can get pregnant."
6173,Now you know.
6174,"Ah, that was just last l read."
6175,"Thanks, I’ll check out the Da Nang hospital outbreak"
6176,Surely there must be some pithy verse to accompany the occasion.
6177,My boyfriend's cousin just died of covid in Mexico.
6178,I never met him.
6179,He was an educated man with a phd in entomology.
6180,The family is devastated.
6181,It sounds like vaccines will be administered by the end of the week in the US.
6182,"The plan Cuomo made based on positivity rates it's still in place currently, but they're shifting to zones based on hospital capacity in the near future."
6183,Might as well save time and reuse the article for the coming weeks.
6184,"Change the date, rinse and repeat."
6185,[removed]
6186,Maybe I somehow missed it in the part about side effects but question: how do we know about long term side effects and how long does that usually take for results?
6187,And yes I’m still getting the vaccine if people were wondering... this is just so I have an answer for those who wish to retort
6188,[removed]
6189,We are more skeptical overall of medical treatment for many justifiable reasons.
6190,Is it warranted when you look back on our history?
6191,Yes.
6192,Is it a reason to not reason the vaccine?
6193,No.
6194,"People are getting mad at the FDA ""delaying"" vaccines, based upon one of Fauci's proclamations, that the vaccine would be available this year to many."
6195,It's almost like the soup of nonsense swirling around is the whole problem.
6196,TLDR: Don't get mad at the FDA for some inane and false promise Fauci made.
6197,He's made a LOT of those.
6198,I'm guessing were now closer to making vaccines for killer viruses since these types of vaccines are using mRNA which means straight to transcription at the cellular level.
6199,"Well, we actually also have a current seatbelt, that's 99.98% effective regarding mortality (if you're in the right age group and are not obese, etc)."
6200,"High risk groups and elderly of course don't have this seatbelt, so should opt for the inferior one which is instantly available."

6202,Absolutely!

6207,"Oh ok, thanks for explaining that."
6208,You can throw the mask away and French kiss your neighbor
6209,"If you're late for your 2nd dose (for example, 6-8 weeks instead of 4), does that ruin the effectiveness of the vaccine after your 2nd dose?"
6210,"I read through the results of this trial (Pfizer) and 9 people got sick, 1 seriously so."
6211,It’s not a large number but we also don’t have information that you don’t spread disease even if you don’t get sick.
6212,"And also, we don’t know how many were asymptomatic and whether they spread disease."
6213,"All I’m saying is, people should do what they can with masks and distancing until community spread comes down."
6214,"And yes, people should be that way about cold and flu as well."
6215,Lung issues take a while to rebound from.
6216,I had clots in my lungs over a decade ago.
6217,It took about a year to feel back to normal.
6218,"I also had no problems, process was totally smooth and took 10 minutes"
6219,My guess is that you'll take whatever one is available in your area or with your provider.
6220,"With distribution being so important, I doubt the same locations will get large amount of each vaccine that you can choose from."
6221,It doesn't sound like that's what CVS is doing.
6222,It sounds like they're modeling the vaccine distribution based on their existing flu shot plan
6223,Can someone clarify the graphic they show about halfway down?
6224,"""Adverse reactions after second dose of vaccine"", and it shows:

**72%** experienced pain at injection site

**55%** fatigue

**45%** headache

**33%** muscle pain 

**29%** chills

**20%** joint pain

**13%** fever

**1%** vomiting

Are these percentages **of those who had an adverse reaction**?"
6225,Or percentages **of everyone** in the study?
6226,"I assumed the former, but they don't say in the article."
6227,"And it could lead to a lot of people thinking you have a 13% chance of a fever from the vaccine, instead of:  If you have an adverse reaction at all (maybe only a small % of this, it doesn't say) 13% of those experiencing any adverse reaction experienced a fever."
6228,Have you EVER been alive when something new has been discovered and learned about?
6229,It's almost like...with new knowledge we adjust our plans.

6247,“Just a flu” is a fallacy.
6248,"The flu is dangerous on its own, this is just *more* dangerous."

6266,The idea that masks wearing was especially common in those regions *before* the pandemic is exaggerated.
6267,That’s my point.
6268,"And yes, I do believe it is dehumanizing."
6269,"It compromises a fundamental aspect of human interaction (facial expressions), which is detrimental to our very nature as social beings."
6270,It seems the Pfizer vaccine is very quickly overtaking Moderna's.
6271,Is it because Moderna's has a short immunity period?
6272,Does Pfizer's provide long term immunity?
6273,"I could see the superspreaders argument, but a key point is that we don't know if the vaccine prevents transmission yet (all we've confirmed is that is prevents symptoms)."
6274,"Until we know that the vaccine prevents transmission, I think it's obvious that vulnerable individuals should be the priority."
6275,We should absolutely incentivize getting the vaccine with a fat stimulus check plus paid work leave and the guarantee of your job waiting for you when you come back from any side effects for each dose.
6276,Available where?
6277,"Sputnik will certainly be available, and I'd be shocked if China doesn't have a working vaccine from all of their candidates"

6292,0.4 = 40%.
6293,0.4% would be 4 tenths of 1 percent or 0.004 = 0.4%.
6294,".04 would equal 4%, so again, no."
6295,I didn’t say they weren’t important.
6296,I said you need context to assess risk.
6297,"300k deaths, sounds like a lot, but how many yearly deaths are normal?"

6299,How sick were these people that died prior to contracting covid?
6300,If 300k healthy 20 year olds died this virus would paint a different picture.
6301,I’m not saying it’s not horrible nor lethal.
6302,It’s more lethal than the flu for some people and it’s less lethal than the flu for kids.

6691,No evidence
6692,I’m glad the CDC at least isn’t buying the BS.
6693,But mayors are desperate
6694,Probably because there are *ridiculous* people who refuse to wear masks anywhere.

6704,where are you getting this 100 million people by March number?
6705,Pfister can give us 50 million doses of the vaccine by April.
6706,that's 25 million people.
6707,Moderana can do about the same number.
6708,that's 50 million people not 100 million.
6709,Hawaii is one of the 3 states that's handling this...better than the others.

6725,"WWII had 408K American deaths, COVID is prob going to pass that :("
6726,"&gt; It seems likely that there are at least 25m people, maybe more, who could have been vaccinated sooner if the administration had taken Pfizer up on their offer."
6727,What offer?
6728,I really don't know
6729,"Just not Jan or Feb, when we have 100-200k cases every day and 2-3k people dying."
6730,Did you not see the dateline special and the news the next day?
6731,Asking people to social distance and wear a mask through summer and even if you get the vaccine before that to continue to mask up and distance as they don't know yet how well it is transmitted after getting a vaccine.
6732,"Hey, I’m not judging you."
6733,"But folks should pay for damages they cause, including hospital bills for those they injure."
6734,"Can’t really say it’s geography when most people travel by plane, maybe we/Australia had less international visitors but it’s a lack of political will/morality to do the right thing for public health."

6739,I don’t think we ever assumed everyone would/ could be vaccinated by March/April...
6740,But we don’t need everyone vaccinated either
6741,They’re first and it’s pretty damn effective.
6742,I mean we already bought 100 million doses.
6743,And when we bought those first 100 mil our understanding was that it going to be enough for 100 mil people.
6744,"When Pfizer gave the US the heads up that 2 doses were going to be needed, the US should have altered the plan accordingly."
6745,I understand not buying another 100 mil from Pfizer.
6746,But it should have been imperative to secure vaccines for those 50 million people from some where.
6747,That’s why I think it’s very fair to criticize the way it was handled.
6748,"Also, if you don’t know enough about the vaccine because you aren’t funding it, the prudent thing to do would be to research it so that you could make an informed decision before decline to buy more."
6749,"Also, I thought only the Biontech/Pfizer vaccine needed -80."
6750,"Moderna is saying they are good at standard freezing temps, and Oxford at fridge temps."

6765,I am considering wearing a mask at home too.
6766,Me and my GF live with her brother and for the most part we stay in our rooms and separate but I've been considering just putting on a mask when I leave my room.. just in case... since my gf is a nurse and he is a delivery driver with a partner.

6777,"You know pfizer is an american corporation too, right?"
6778,"Yep, they should've suspended normal ER admission laws and allow hospitals to say ""sorry, we're full"" once they reach their normal operating capacity."

6851,"&gt;  
&gt;All close contacts (F1), defined as people who have been within approximately 6 feet (2 meters) of or have prolonged contact of 30 or more minutes with a confirmed COVID-19 case, are identified by this process and tested for the virus."
6852,"&gt;  
&gt;If F1s test positive for the virus, they are placed in isolation at a hospital—all COVID-19 patients are hospitalized at no cost in Vietnam, regardless of symptoms."

7020,IMO yes in the USA.
7021,We’d have around a 100 million people vaccinated by the end of March and that should eclipse healthcare workers and at risk individuals.

7033," 

By the end of the year, the United States government hopes to have close to 40 million doses of COVID-19 vaccine."
7034,It plans to distribute half of those in December and hold back the other half to give the same people their second dose of the two-shot regimen.
7035,"But Dr. Scott Gottlieb, a Pfizer board member and former U.S. Food and Drug Administration commissioner, says that's a bad idea."
7036,"Instead, Gottlieb says he would give out 35 million doses now, and presume the second doses will be available when people need them."
7037,"That way, he says, a lot more people can be protected as the U.S. endures the worst of the COVID-19 pandemic."
7038,"“We should get as many shots in our arms as possible right away,” he told the USA TODAY Editorial Board on Monday."
7039,"“The idea that we need to cut (the doses) in half and give half of it now and hold onto it, so we have supply in January to get the second dose … I just fundamentally disagree with that.”

As the U.S. continues to suffer from a surge with nearly 200,000 new cases each day, according to a USA TODAY analysis of Johns Hopkins data, Gottlieb says the government should focus on vaccinating as many people as possible with first doses."
7040,He anticipates another 40 million doses should be ready in time for the second shot of the two-dose regimen.
7041,"The inability to do so would indicate a manufacturing process problem exceeding that of people not getting their second dose on schedule, he argues."
7042,"“I don’t think we should be holding onto supply now, anticipating something goes wrong that’s going to cause a lot of other challenges,” said Gottlieb."
7043,"“We should be taking some risk.”

Arthur Caplan, professor and founding head of the division of medical ethics at the NYU School of Medicine in New York City, agrees."
7044,"“Vaccinat(ing) as many as possible in the midst of a horrific deadly plague to maximize lives saved has to be our moral priority,” he said."
7045,"“I will accept a bit of risk in terms of supply to get to that goal as long as manufacturers will promise that the second doses are highly, highly likely to be available for those who got the first dose.” 

 Some experts however, are not convinced they would take that risk, especially after Pfizer and its partner BioNTech slashed the number of doses for the end of the year from an original estimate of 100 million."
7046,"According to [TIME magazine ](https://time.com/5917847/pfizer-cut-covid-19-vaccine-targets/)and [the Wall Street Journal](https://www.wsj.com/articles/pfizer-slashed-its-covid-19-vaccine-rollout-target-after-facing-supply-chain-obstacles-11607027787?reflink=desktopwebshare_twitter), a spokeswoman cited supply-chain issues, saying that scaling up the raw material supply chain ""took longer than expected."""
7047,"“The hardest part of making vaccines is making vaccines,” said Dr. Paul Offit, director of the Vaccine Education Center and an attending physician in the Division of Infectious Diseases at Children's Hospital of Philadelphia."
7048,"“Mass production is always the hardest part.”

The Pifzer/BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine, as well as another frontrunner from Moderna, is based on messenger RNA technology."
7049,Offit says the lipid particles used to carry the mRNA into the body are the most difficult part of the vaccine to scale up.
7050,The lipid particles protect the mRNA from degenerating too quickly in the body before it gets delivered into the cell.
7051,"The benefit of vaccinating 40 million people may outweigh the risk of delaying a second dose if the first dose was at least 50% effective, he said, because people would be partially protected."
7052,But not everyone agrees.
7053,"Operation Warp Speed chief science adviser Dr. Moncef Slaoui said in an interview Sunday with Margaret Brennan on CBS’ Face the Nation “it would be inappropriate to partially immunize large numbers of people and not complete their immunization.”

Not only would it be taking a risk, he said, it also could decrease confidence in the vaccine."
7054,"“We don’t know how the behavior of the vaccine would be if we omit to give the second dose at three weeks or at four weeks after the first dose,” Slaoui said."
7055,“We want to do things by exactly how they were studied and how they have been approved.”

7210,Its no surprise Taiwanese people were able to repel covid and follow directions without some dumb inconsistency involving morals and politics.
7211,My point was that the two that are going to start rolling out soon will only cover 100 million people.
7212,"The other 500 million doses are from a company that likely won't get emergency authorization in the US for awhile, and even when they do, until they can answer the question regarding exposure/infectiousness, people will still need to distance and mask (and you know 50% or more will not do that) to ensure asymptomatic spread is contained."
7213,"You can argue there was no way to know which vaccine would be most effective and safe this summer, but putting 62.5% of the doses in one single company was kind of putting the eggs in one basket."

7215,"When the AZ trial was paused this summer due to the (likely) transverse myelitis case, more contracts should have been secured with Pfizer and Moderna, who were already completing their studies and showing high efficiency with low risk of side effects (although both did not bother to do weekly PCR tests, so we don't know if there were asymptomatic cases within their test subjects)."
7216,"And on your last point, you seemed to miss the entire point of my first reply."
7217,"It wasn't that we secured more doses then we needed, it was that we *didn't* secure enough doses of the two vaccines showing the greatest chance of being delivered to the public quickly."
7218,The 500 million doses of AZ 'secured' will mean literally nothing if it doesn't get approval.
7219,Or if they cannot figure out why they had higher effectiveness with a lower dose than a higher one.
7220,"If the FDA and CDC do not approve it, that 'secured contract' means as much as the paper it was written on."
7221,"Right now, all we have secured that we know can be administered are 100 million doses each of Moderna and Pfizer."
7222,"Both of those companies have contracts with many countries and can only make so many doses in the year (I forget what was stated in another article today, but it wasn't a ton)- because we hesitated on securing more, if AZ falls through/fails to be approved, we will have to wait until 2022 before we can get access to more doses, meaning 215 million people will still be at risk of developing severe Covid symptoms/dying for another year."
7223,15 million cases this year have overwhelmed hospitals on multiple occasions - that is a drop in the bucket compared to the potential cases that can occur over the next year.
7224,"Poor planning and response means that we will have another entire year of potential masks, shut downs, protests, failing economy, job loss, etc."
7225,"We cannot reach herd immunity with only 37.5% inoculated, so things aren't going to remotely go back to normal anytime soon if AZ fails and it seems like each week brings more concerning news about their chances of being approved anytime soon."

7293,Anyone who is expecting made the decision to have a baby during a pandemic and should've known the risks and potential consequences.

7298,Might not.

7308,This shouldn't be complicated.
7309,Well lets pray it's safe then because this sounds like the plot to a horror movie.
7310,Herd mentality works much better than herd immunity.
7311,"1) I’m basing this on the assumption made in my OP, in which I clearly stated the assumption if Moderna, JJ and Oxford could all deliver similar quantities as Pfizer, there would be enough dosses for .5 of the US."

7314,I don’t know what needs a citation in this paragraph.
7315,"Like, I don’t know what you’re trying to get at by asking for citations."
7316,"I know that is the go to argument on this site but I really wasn’t trying to state facts, I was implying that **if** the US gets enough vaccine to 50% of the population and, and people like yourself put up a fit, implying that you think the US should hog as many vaccines as they can it comes of as hypocritical, especially since the main messaging was to “protect vulnerable at all costs”."

7318,We make policy decisions based on averages.

7323,"The risk to the millennial group, on aggregate, is low."
7324,4.
7325,I understand that.
7326,But Americans having a temper tantrum about *only* getting a few hundred million vaccines in early 2021 while other countries only have enough to vaccinate 10% of their population is extremely selfish and petty.

7334,It was turned off.
7335,I assumed it died in the washing machine.
7336,But 3 days after he died someone turned his phone back on and tried to make multiple transactions through it.
7337,Who steals a cell phone from an elderly man in the ICU?
7338,His room phone wasn't working either &amp; due to Covid restrictions he was only allowed one visitor for three hours a day.
7339,His phone was how he talked to his family.

7498,What's really frustrating is that I got chided by a ton of people for being like the county caseworker told me like best case scenario is fall 2021 that I as a homeless person in their 30s could hope to be vaccinated.
7499,"It's probably going to be true and it's just really fucking frustrating that we don't have a clear idea about any of this, how it's being released, how we can be verified that we have the vaccine for travel/work/school/whatever purposes and so on."
7500,"&gt; The point is that if we are going to use the same metric to compare covid deaths, then we also need a multiplier for covid deaths."
7501,My point was that this is not a good comparison because the flu has become so ubiquitous that it is often not diagnosed at all.
7502,I have serious doubts where in a typical unit with many very old patients with various serious health conditions anyone bothered to test for flu.
7503,"Unlike Covid-19, very few people are ever tested for flu, even in hospitals."
7504,That's why most fatality estimates we see about the flu seasons are based on the high level estimates.

7629,When one of today's headlines was about who went to the White House party with Covid; I'm not surprised.
7630,They are following the example set.
7631,Just goes to show that Fauci is also susceptible to opening his mouth and talking bollocks
7632,Lol.
7633,If they feared spread they would wear masks especially since it is the location of several superspreader events.
7634,I dont have the energy to give anyone there sympathy.
7635,They stopped listening to guidelines when a vaccine was announced.
7636,Americans are incapable of pulling Together for the common good for longer than a few days max.
7637,Have you ever been in a Turkish prison?
7638,I literally countered your false claim by referencing source you claimed to reference.
7639,"Also, your paywall article is 5 years old and falls behind WHO, that YOU, YOURSELF used as source in upper comment 

You basically self-served your own ass"
7640,The vaccine will be administered for free in many counties
7641,I didnt say it was rushed out I said I would rather our end review it then rush it out
7642,Everyone us throwing around wrong numbers.
7643,"Check CDC, NYTimes and Johns Hopkins."
7644,In 2 states 0.4% who got virus died.
7645,In 25 states 1 % who got the virus died.
7646,In 21 states and territories 2% who got virus died.
7647,In 3 states 3% who got virus died.
7648,In 2 states 4% who got virus died.

7650,"United States lost:
.08% of our population

7652,Same.
7653,I miss the gym.
7654,I miss my friends.
7655,"I miss my family (who I haven't seen in a year and a half, was going to fly back in April...)

I'll put on the mask if I have to, but, and I'm sorry to be crass here, fuck you if you think I'm living like this after I am vaccinated."
7656,I think those people are mostly being hyperbolic.
7657,"""I'm gonna hit the club as soon as I get the vaccine"" - well good luck finding an open club."
7658,"Or a party, for that matter."
7659,"Sure, I'll hit the clubs as soon as they open, which by then it will be over anyway."
7660,"As for the impression that it's saying more than just ""not immediately"" - well, their reasoning."
7661,"The justification is not knowing whether the vaccine prevents spreading or just symptoms, and the implication that if it's the latter it would make a difference and mean we'll have to keep masking/distancing until there's a vaccine entirely separate from this one that prevents spreading, which who knows how long we'll have to wait for."
7662,That's asinine.
7663,But yeah that's how it reads to me at least and probably why many are having a knee-jerk reaction to this.
7664,In reality though luckily that won't be the case at all with this one as long as the numbers indicate a non-emergency.
7665,Right?
7666,I should have brought those up.
7667,Just going off the source.
7668,Do you have one or is your armchair more qualified than the rest somehow?
7669,&gt;Plus the very few times I've tried it alcohol tastes horrible and I don't like the feeling of it.
7670,"Yeah, I'm pretty sure people like alcohol only because of peer pressure."
7671,Texas have limited tech too.
7672,In fact all the outpatient ER hired LMRT and expect them to work the front desk/take call
7673,"Nobody want to be intubated by a psychiatrist 😳, it happened in Italy in March , it shouldn't be happening in the US 9 months later.😞"
7674,No.
7675,Experts have all said they are safe
7676,That's what I did and said (regarding many documentaries having agendas much like conspiracy videos).
7677,I showed her vaccine data how it has been tested by thousands of volunteers.
7678,"But nope, she went on how corporations manipulated science data and sent me an article about the times medical science has been wrong."
7679,"That seems insanely high, 1 in 8 people will get a fever?"
7680,Over 1/2 will have fatigue?
7681,"I was tracking this from the initial report  [https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2020/11/fever-aches-pfizer-moderna-jabs-aren-t-dangerous-may-be-intense-some](https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2020/11/fever-aches-pfizer-moderna-jabs-aren-t-dangerous-may-be-intense-some)

7687,As someone who works in one you're completely off base.
7688,A few bad apples doesn't mean that all the people who care for the elderly are criminals.
7689,"Most people who work in long term care facilities are deeply empathic people who put up with shitty wages, bullies in administration, physical and sexual assault from residents and assholes like you because they care for others."
7690,You know what it only takes a few weeks to get your CNA license.
7691,Why don't you get yours and work for a few months?
7692,Maybe then you'd have empathy for some of the most import yet absolutely denigrated workers in our society.
7693,"Uh no, we can’t"
7694,Well... it’s not.
7695,In any way.
7696,"I think the consensus for a lot of other vaccines is it isn’t always a great idea to get them if you’re more than mildly sick, because it can be a bit rough on the immune system."
7697,If I were you I would talk to a doctor prior to getting vaccinated if you’re still sick.
7698,No reason to believe it's not.
7699,"&gt; While the impending arrival of the vaccine is reason for hope, he said, “at the moment, we have to face reality, and the reality is that we are suffering a very dire situation with the pandemic.”

Exactly."
7700,"While there is a vaccine, it’ll be some time before normal Americans can get it."

7702,Is it really worth it?
7703,"Commendably AstraZeneca has just published their Phase III results as a peer-reviewed publication here: https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(20)32661-1/fulltext

In short, there was no difference between the vaccine and control arm there, and lymphadenopathy was not documented as an adverse effect there."
7704,"Of course it's gonna stop the spread, you can't spread a virus as fast if a large chunk of your population is immune."
7705,Yeah a few more months after .
7706,And I can’t opt out of going because I work at a grocery store myself.
7707,I take Covid very seriously I’m just not into the “new normal attitude” because I’m afraid the new thing will be protecting people from the flu.
7708,I’m sick of wearing them all day and I just want to know it will end at some point.
7709,In July AstraZeneca looked like by far the most promising one in development.

7732,Even that feels too late.
7733,So easy to slip into July.
7734,"If there's widespread availability of a vaccine in late March, we should be pushing for late April."
7735,"We need some urgency on this, people's lives have been on hold for a year."
7736,Yes - pregnant woman checking in
7737,It's estimated that vaccinating just 2% of the most vulnerable people in the UK will prevent 40% of the deaths and that the first wave of 10 million vaccinations could prevent up to 99% of deaths.
7738,"You're definitely understating the significance of these vaccines, they're the gamechanger we've been waiting for."
7739,I'm not fear mongering.
7740,I was asking for reassurance.
7741,"I am personally weirded out by untested tech and would prefer old school vaccines since they are becoming available and the Russian one seems to be doing well over there, but with Covid being so crazy, and me having high risk relatives as well as being high risk myself, I want to get vaccinated as soon as possible."
7742,I just wanted something to soothe my concerns about mRNA vaccines.
7743,Not everybody that is leery of the mRNA vaccines is an anti-vaxxer or covid denier.

7760,Many are not following the science
7761,"here's a thought, why not do both."
7762,Good
7763,It is a trend in live/attenuated vaccines.
7764,MMRV is weak versions of all 4 viruses listed.
7765,TB vaccine depends on weak mycobacterium bovis.
7766,Oral polio is also a candidate.
7767,Herd immunity (when enough people take the vaccine that it makes it difficult for the virus to spread in a community) is super important because there are always a subset of people who can’t safely take vaccines due to rare medical conditions or allergies.
7768,So getting vaccinated protects other people too.
7769,Jesus christ dude.

7778,And the old normal to return a month or so after there's widespread availability of the vaccine.
7779,Yes?
7780,"Science doesn't get less complicated with more money, it just means you have more resources."

7823,"We'll never get past this if people continue to act as if they're ""being careful"" and won't get the virus, so they ignore the guidelines."
7824,Literally fuck anyone who has met up with people outside of your immediate family or work group since after Thanksgiving.
7825,You're part of the problem.
7826,How convenient...Desantis says he is not involved.
7827,Right that's why we should have universal healthcare
7828,She illegally got into the system Florida uses after being fired from her job for constantly starting fights with the governor (while I dislike desantis and in no way voted or supported him) and making up allegations without proof that he was hiding the true number of cases and deaths

7842,"Hmm, 100 million people vaccinated (so 200 million doses total) was actually the goal I believe, according to the head of warp speed (wants to vaccinate 20-30 million this month, then 20-25 million each month on)."
7843,"It'll definitely depend on where you are, in the USA the goal is to have 100 million people vaccinated by the end of March, but I know other countries like Canada are behind a bit."

7857,I asked my doctor recently if she is seeing her pregnant patients get much sicker than non pregnant patients with Covid.
7858,"Her whole demeanor changed immediately and she said, “Yes, and unfortunately we have lost a few pregnant patients”... at a small, two doctor OBGYN."
7859,Just the way her face changed freaked me right out.
7860,"You honestly believe 2020 was a metric for who cares about the middle-aged, healthy, strong, and soldiers?"
7861,"The past four years aren’t an anomaly that’s going to go away now, it’s a warning of what we have been building towards in all of the prior years."
7862,"Yes, Melbourne actually, we had a long lockdown of 3 months but things are almost back to normal and the hospitals are fine and not too many people died (mainly elderly in nursing homes) from the “second wave”."

7874,We've been reporting higher than 90% for weeks.
7875,The additional caveat is that not all beds are available for covid-19 patients.
7876,You tend to group covid-19 patients together and reserve other rooms at the hospital for the expected non-covid traffic.
7877,It gets tricky knowing where someone needs to go when places are out of the bed you need.
7878,It's not news.
7879,"Early on, the US bought 100 mil doses from pfizer, 100 mil from moderna, 300 mil from Oxford, and has deals with J&amp;J and Novavax for unspecified amounts."

8079,A good chunk of the containers across the world also has to go through the Kaohsiung port before it gets redistributed across Asia.
8080,a quick search shows that it's the 14th busiest port in the world in terms of container turn over.

8082,Both of these means they have to deal with much higher than normal outside sources of infection.

8092,The comparison would be like saying how can an umbrella protect from rain if people still sometimes get cold while wearing a hat in winter.
8093,It makes no sense to compare that.
8094,&gt;How does the COVID-19 vaccine differ from the flu shot?
8095,&gt;The COVID-19 vaccine works completely differently than the yearly flu vaccine.
8096,"“The flu shot gives you an inactivated virus,” Dr. Adalja explains."
8097,"From there, the vaccine causes antibodies to develop in your body about two weeks after you get the shot, per the CDC."
8098,Those antibodies then help protect you against infection with the strains of the flu that are used to make the vaccine for that season.
8099,"&gt;The coronavirus vaccine, on the other hand, “gives you a snippet of a gene,” not an inactive virus, Dr. Adalja says."
8100,"&gt;You also need to get two shots of the current coronavirus vaccines—typically three to four weeks apart—while the flu vaccine is just one shot a year, Dr. Schaffner says."
8101,"It’s unclear at this point if people will need the COVID-19 vaccine each year, he says."
8102,"There are single-dose vaccines in the works as well, including one from Johnson &amp; Johnson, which recently reached phase 3 of it clinical trial."
8103,[source](https://www.prevention.com/health/a34833921/coronavirus-covid-19-vaccine-side-effects/)
8104,Not sure I understand your sentence.
8105,I assume you meant “catching it doesn’t mean you’re immune”?
8106,"In that case, there have been less that 1 case in a million of documented reinfection."
8107,Which is way less prone to infection than any of the vaccines (0.0001% reinfected vs 5% or so still vulnerable after vaccination).
8108,"So neither make you immune, but natural seems much more effective at preventing future infections than the vaccines."
8109,"I have a friend who is a veteran and told me that they were salaried but worked insanely long hours, and if you took that into account then her and her husband only made like 5 bucks an hour...one person's experience, take it for what its worth, but yeah she says the benefits are greatly overstated."

8116,&gt;I like how your response assumes that a competent response could only come from a Democrat.
8117,"I really like your reply there, and I think it really encapsulates a very important part of modern american politics."
8118,The modern republican party really represents an *anti*-government stance entirely.
8119,"the only conceivable ""effective"" sort of ""planning"" that seems acceptable to the right wing in america would have to come from a corporation, but even that sort of option would just as likely be scrutinized by right wing media as to whether the planning was acceptable or not."
8120,"republicans *used* to operate underneath a facade-esque notion that they believed in ""small *but effective* governance"", but that seems to have changed pretty radically in the last 20 years in the direction of ""no noticeable governance at all""."
8121,You're fun at parties surely
8122,Not really.
8123,It takes time to deliver hundreds of millions of vaccines and more vaccines are in the pipeline.
8124,"The reason the flu vaccine is less effective than others is because there are multiple flu strains, and the vaccine is scientists’ best guesses as to the 3-4 dominant strains that will be circulating during our flu season."
8125,"Some years they make better guesses than others, which means some years the flu vaccine is more effective and other times less; they’re trying to cover a virus that mutates and has multiple strains."
8126,"This does not seem to be the case with covid (ie, they’re not trying to cover multiple strains)."
8127,The vaccines effectively target the virus as it is.
8128,"Not a scientist, just my best guess"
8129,You do realize that there's a line right?
8130,I can't believe how many people are defending this decision

8140,"Similar crowding occured during Biden's victory celebrations, and again, no condemnation."
8141,"Yet when conservatives held a boat parade, where people are literally isolated on their boats, dozens of feet from one another at the closest, the media cried that we didn't care about the virus."

8152,Where I live the county executive banned indoor dining.
8153,It has created huge controversy here.
8154,Several restaurants filed suit against the county executive.
8155,I then said I was going to boycott those restaurants because a handful stayed open for indoor dining.
8156,"There were several people I talked to who specifically supported the restaurants filing suit, just to prove a point."
8157,At least 3 people have said variations of “where is the evidence that indoor dining leads to spread?” It’s challenging because I don’t have any research or stats to back up which this logically isn’t a good idea.
8158,I just argue that you can’t wear a mask while you’re eating and indoors are always going to be more risky than outdoors.

8164,"Now, America is kind of faces with a choice with how they want to be perceived ."
8165,"1) accept that they’ll still get enough vaccine to immunize probably HALF of their population (probably everyone 50+ who wants it) , essentially eliminating the increased risk of death to the population, while allowing other countries to do the same."
8166,"Essentially, deaths across many countries flatline to something comparable to the flu on aggregate."
8167,The younger population gets vaccinated in the fall and all is good.
8168,"2) America puts up a stink about not getting ALL the vaccine, *despite already having enough to vaccinate the at risk population*."
8169,"The stink, being put up by mostly the younger population  because they’re scared of potential “long covid”, means that other countries wouldn’t have enough to vaccinate *their* over 50 crowd and would see more deaths while we wait for American **low risk** millennials to get their shots, who ironically, are the same people who have religiously spewed the buzzword messaging of  “**we’re all in this together**” and “**its not about youuuu, selfish young person**” all over this site for 9 months."

8237,"Too many stupid people cannot wait for couple more weeks before the vaccine is available and will decide to ""enjoy"" the Xmas shopping and gathering, even when they could potentially ended sick and dead."
8238,"We will see Thanksgiving surge to appear later this week and Xmas holiday surge, in mid January."

8241,Yess but their fur is so cute!
8242,We need to skin millions of them so Chinese housewives can wear mink fur coats!
8243,We have no idea what precautions the nursing home was taking with its employees.
8244,In fact it's certain that the employees *were* given direction to isolate and to report any symptoms they might develop and to stay away from work if they have symptoms since those instructions are being given to basically everyone who works in health care right now.
8245,"In short, it's pretty unlikely the nursing home itself is to blame for this; as cathartic as it might be to point the finger at them and say they should have done more."
8246,No precautions they could have taken would eliminate the risk of an employee secretly breaking the rules and going to a superspreader event on their own time.
8247,"If the employee went ahead and did that and then lied to their employer about it -- including a lie of omission which would *absolutely apply in this case* since in Washington state, nursing home employees are required to complete a checklist certifying they haven't potentially exposed themselves to the virus at the start of each shift -- then the culpability falls squarely on the employee, not the employer."
8248,Of course the nursing home is going to end up getting sued anyway; because anyone involved even in the slightest that actually has deep pockets will get sued whether they were at fault or not.
8249,But a court likely won't find the nursing home responsible for the infection getting in the door.
8250,"It would be the same result, but the government would make it illegal to opt out for public health reasons."
8251,Can’t have it both ways.
8252,Trying to opt out of a vaccine is just a reckless and selfish choice.

8254,Let's look at the CDC recommending newborns be with the mother.
8255,"&gt; If you are diagnosed with or test positive for the virus that causes COVID-19, you should discuss with your healthcare provider the risks and benefits of having your newborn stay in the same room with you."
8256,"Oh, so their position isn't actually that they shouldn't be separated."
8257,It's that the mother should weigh the risks and decide.
8258,"That's not quite as strong a claim as ""all the best doctors believe it would be unbelievably sick and cruel to do it."""
8259,There’s got to be more to this.

8266,"So far, not impressed..."
8267,Read the news.
8268,They went into the second wave early and did almost nothing.
8269,Then further restrictions didn't do shit until they locked people up (1h/1km around your residence allowed) again for a month.

8275,"If we vaccinate the 25% of the population that’s most at risk, we’d be able to go back to normal."
8276,The remaining 75% of the population is at almost zero risk from getting infected anyways.
8277,Florida is doing much better than California.
8278,This comment makes no sense.
8279,The containment measures were too extreme for any Democracy to enforce.
8280,"I'm all for arresting or fining people who don't wear masks and/or hold large gatherings, but the Chinese government literally welded people into their homes."
8281,There was a case of a small child being trapped in a home with their dead grandparent.
8282,"They arrested reporters for reporting on the virus, and did the same to whistleblower doctors."
8283,"Taiwan is a much better example all around, as is NZ."
8284,"As I read it, it is 100 million doses altogether."
8285,So 50 million people will be vaccinated in total... with the Pfizer vaccine.
8286,The government hasn't yet made additional purchases from Moderna.
8287,"&gt;Pfizer officials had urged Operation Warp Speed to initially purchase 200 million doses, or enough of the two-shot regimen for 100 million people last summer, according to people knowledgeable about the issue who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they weren’t authorized to discuss the situation."
8288,"But the Warp Speed officials declined, opting instead for 100 million doses, they said."

8333,He probably thinks that would make him look good and prevent his replacement from showing the world how much better he can handle this crisis.
8334,But realistically speaking this crisis won't end until 70% of the world is vaccinated.
8335,"He met with the bootlicking, covid deniers who still carry their tiki torches for trump."
8336,"The irony is a thick as the snot ruby smeared on his sweaty, die dripping head."
8337,He's already used thinly-veiled language indicating he does not intend to prioritize NY.
8338,Whether it's discrimination would depend on the level of risk an unvaccinated person poses and whether reasonable accommodation is possible.
8339,There are already jobs that pregnant women cannot be hired for because it's a safety liability.

8343,"He's been careful to not overstate things in the past, and based on other SARS coronaviruses, that is about what we see."

8345,"Regardless of peoples expert informed views, we just dont have any data specific to SARS-CoV-2 to suggest *what* the period of immunity looks like."
8346,"Realistically, after you vaccinate your at risk groups no amount of restrictive measures make sense."
8347,A small segment of the population represents an overwhelming majority of the hospitalizations and deaths.
8348,"If you take them out of the equation, the overall risk of covid is basically non existent."
8349,I actually reached out to a county organization that provides help to people or at least has accepted literally thousands of dollars from the group to do so and it's all going to toys for kids.
8350,There are also about a dozen other groups specifically doing stuff for families PLUS churches PLUS businesses giving out to families only- NO single individuals.
8351,They actually are soliciting to try to find more families to donate to because so many are already receiving aid.
8352,"I contacted her and asked her if she knew anywhere in town I could ask about holiday help because hot meals are great, I had one on Thanksgiving thanks to a generous redditor, and since the motels I stay in don't have a microwave and sometimes don't even have fridges it would just be nice."
8353,She was like well holidays are important to *families* not as important for individuals.
8354,"It was a pretty big knife to the heart, I'll be honest."
8355,"I aged out of foster care so yeah, I don't have a ""family"" and I'm not married or have a kid."
8356,"I hate having to ask for charitable help, but I know I'm not in the position to decline or to sit with being embarrassed and ashamed all day about it."
8357,"Point is, I hope people help others and all types of families and people, not just the nuclear ones."
8358,"There are so many people hurting and people who need help, that truthfully, we really really need the government to step in because charity ain't going to cut it at the end of the day."
8359,Great!
8360,Are these other manufacturers delivering starting next week?
8361,Because Pfizer is.
8362,"So unless they are as well, it is meaningless."

8544,Nobody would even give you a vaccine while pregnant.
8545,Chill.
8546,This spring was brutal in the Navajo nations.
8547,I hope their winter is not as harsh.
8548,Isn't that the joke.
8549,It's true.
8550,All who look into this know this to be true.
8551,"There is a large segment of the American population who are unwilling, incapable, frightened, damaged psyche's who won't consider this at all."
8552,The only good thing “she” has done in four years.
8553,Americans First!
8554,It’s funny only now people are paying attention to nursing homes.
8555,Their workers get paid shit and are always understaffed.
8556,The States are supposed to check up on these facilities.
8557,Looks like they didn’t.
8558,Sadly this is going to happen multiple times in the next few months.
8559,"It’s not about sorrow, it’s about understanding that old people die."
8560,A school bus going off a cliff and killing a bunch of children is tragic.
8561,"A few sick ninety-year-olds in a nursing home dying is a normal, natural, expected part of life."
8562,They are on the edge of death.
8563,It’s okay.
8564,"We don’t need to fight that reality, or shut down society, to save these elderly people."
8565,[removed]
8566,The burden of evidence is on you.
8567,Is it because an increasing number of Americans still alive are not COVID deniers?
8568,"(no, I know it's not only that)."
8569,Thankfully mine won't.
8570,He's describing how covid spread in your body.
8571,"It has tentacles that grabs your cell, hitch a ride to another part of your body and infect there."
8572,The infected cell then grew their own tentacles to infect
8573,So we should have pre-ordered every single vaccine in development and enough of each to cover every American?
8574,This is the first mRNA vaccine ever approved.
8575,We ordered more than anyone per person and did with 2 different mRNA vaccines at that.
8576,This is the hardest one to store and ship of all the vaccines.
8577,This one and I mean one area the US did just fine on.
8578,Slaoui said we'd only get about 12-13 million doses each month for the next few months from them which is....still no where close.
8579,Even factoring in Johnson and Johnson and others that has to be spread out over months the math doesn't add up
8580,Right.
8581,"Pfizer asked us months ago if we wanted more, and the government said, ""No, we're good, thanks."""
8582,Now Trump thinks he can force them to be sold in America which is ridiculous.
8583,That’s before the election facts.
8584,He’s yesterday’s news to people who are listening to doctors.
8585,Fauci is still talking and making statements all over so it’s not as if he’s gone.
8586,Anyway not to be rude but this is a tangent from the main topic.
8587,I’ve explained my views as much as I can.
8588,The downvotes are very telling.
8589,It's not like it shows that was the national policy from the outset or anything.
8590,That’s fine by me honestly.
8591,And I’m lucky enough to be able to work remotely.
8592,"There are tons of ppl like me who work remotely, earn high incomes, and can afford to stick this out for the long run because we’re not risking it."
8593,I’m just providing a different perspective.
8594,That is the answer though.
8595,"Pretending that wanting to lockdown for another year is a rational thought, is not helpful either."
8596,"  
Good for 44 days."
8597,Nursing home residents will almost certainly be in phase 1 in state protocol as the CDC had recommended.
8598,"Yeah, we don't have the vaccines for a mass vaccination campaign this month."
8599,"I do think though once we start vaccinating at-risk people (which should happen this winter) deaths will drop

FWIW we expect in the USA to have 100 million people vaccinated by end of March, I think that covers healthcare workers/at risk people pretty well for the most part."
8600,So we'd see in mid-April near non existent deaths etc.
8601,Christmas is hard for kids without gifts.
8602,We as a society have made presents a very big deal for a long time now so naturally kids eagerly anticipate it.
8603,"Plus little Timmy has to go to school and feel like an outcast because the other kids got gifts and he didnt, compounding the misery."
8604,I get what you are presumably saying about prioritizing expenses but making the kids pay the price yet again for the adults fucking up seems awfully cruel.
8605,Maybe this year will be the impetus needed to teach us all not to be so materislistic and to teach some other lessons at Christmas.
8606,"I mean, this whole year has been bewildering and strange for kids."
8607,Lots if places had pools and parks and summer activities canceled.
8608,"They weren't allowed to see their friends for the most part, school and  that is handled abruptly changed, and undoubtedly they feel the extra tension from mom and/or dad when money is tight."
8609,"More of them have faced hunger and domestic violence and child abuse cases have increased in number, often with no relief/help that the kid would ordinarily get at school."
8610,Having no Christmas just seems like adding insult to injury.
8611,Here's hoping that by this time in 2021 things are better for all of us.
8612,"Four of Pfizer’s facilities are part of the manufacturing and supply chain; St. Louis, MO; Andover, MA; and Kalamazoo, MI in the U.S.; and Puurs in Belgium."
8613,BioNTech’s German sites will also be leveraged for global supply.
8614,Belgium is just a fraction of the pie
8615,You just answered your own question.
8616,Moderna and Pfizer are about to be approved and already have 100 million plus doses ready between the two of them and if J&amp;J gets approved in January that’s millions of more single shot vaccine doses ready to go
8617,"So what if I'm young, fit and healthy, do I still have to take it?"
8618,because that just seems illogical
8619,I’m hoping this is the case for me lol I’ll keep you updated

8621,You're incredibly naive and support clogging up an already clogged court system with an unprovable case.
8622,"You can't prove who spread the virus to who or how, when, and where the spreader contracted the disease."

8634,It's not a home remedy.
8635,It's a vital vitamin that most people are deficient in.
8636,There is significant data linking vitamin D and other respiratory infections and we're now learning this is also the case with COVID.
8637,The pre-print study OP linked only concludes a single dose of vitamin D won't help you when you're already critically ill.
8638,It takes weeks to metabolize one dose of vitamin D and months to correct a deficiency.

8669,"I mean, even with this in mind, I still don't agree with you."
8670,Spreading a potentially fatal disease during a pandemic is regrettable and avoidable by *not* attending a large gathering (that you know you're not supposed to attend) and then going to work with some of the most vulnerable people.
8671,"If I understand your response correctly, you're saying that our sorrow is diminished by the knowledge that an older person's life was coming to an end anyway."
8672,I don't know that's true; I've been in this situation a few times and that hasn't been the case.
8673,Baltimore city schools are an excellent counter-example to the original post.
8674,"According to many other articles and CDC during the 2018-2019 flu season the US had about 35K deaths, in spite of the vaccines."
8675,"Also, most likely the number is actually much higher because when a typical elderly patient dies in a hospital rarely would anyone check if she or he had the flu."
8676,"Let's not pretend the flu is harmless, because they have been years when hundreds of kids died of the flu."
8677,And the flu vaccine is about 50% effective in a typical year.
8678,"https://www.cdc.gov/flu/about/burden/2018-2019.html#:~:text=CDC%20estimates%20that%20influenza%20was,the%202018%E2%80%932019%20influenza%20season."

8684,The covid patients at McLaren Flint are seen once a day by staff.
8685,They have IV's and other lines hooked up outside of the room so no-one has to go in.
8686,The hallways are a nest of tubes and they keep opening up new floors for covid.
8687,The worst part is they did 4 services a day across 4 different campuses over the weekend and tonight.
8688,"No, people would."
8689,People don't think Covid exists.
8690,People don't understand why flu cases are down.
8691,People don't beleive in masks.
8692,"They won't impact anything because the first round are going to healthcare workers, who are an immaterial number of the cases."
8693,There will not be mass vaccination this winter.
8694,"It's not planned, it's not possible."
8695,"Have friends who were stationary nurses but once the pandemic hit, they decided as a couple to do travel nursing, I added up their hourly rate and they’re making roughly $500k/year each right now, it’s actually wild, think they are paying off their student debt and trying to save for a down payment on a house too."

8708,Why are the health experts so sure we can vaccinate 100 million people by February?
8709,The only 2 vaccine candidates likely to be approved this month is Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna.
8710,Oxford was a possibility until they screwed up and will be redoing their trials and Novavax and Johnson &amp; Johnson seem to be a January/Feb approval.
8711,"Just based on production capacity I dont see 100 mill happening or even close to 50 mil until at least one of the big 2 with novavax and J&amp;J come online 

CureVac and Medicago seem a distance away and everyone else is either the Russian/Chinese vaccines or ones just starting Phase II trials"
8712,How probable is it for there to not be any more doses produced within a month?
8713,I think they should take that into account.

8720,It's an act of defiance in a sense.
8721,Whether it matters I'm not really sure.
8722,Not to mention how difficult it is to even vote in this country especially if you are poor.
8723,Far easier for teachers perhaps but much less effective for students.
8724,I think the us should get more first proportionally because the us is more fucked by a few orders of magnitude with the number of cases.
8725,Can't tell if you're trolling or a high schooler😂😂
8726,Pfizer (bioNTech) and Moderna have been grinding away on mRNA for years.
8727,Well before COVID-19 popped into humans.

8739,Kudos
8740,That answer is about as helpful as suggesting we lock down the country indefinitely.
8741,Don't be a jerk.
8742, We really shouldn't interfere with their propaganda.
8743,"The Taiwanese are paying everywhere to attack the CCP, but the CCP itself doesn't care and is indirectly funding this propaganda."
8744,Why should we defend the CCP?
8745,There are so many disgusting Taiwanese companies still making money in China and donating money to the Taiwan government that the CCP has no restrictions on them and gives them a lot of preferential treatment.The CCP is trying to solve the problem in the capitalist way and buy off the top people in Taiwan instead of MAO's method.
8746,It will be proved wrong and we don't need to intervene.
8747,Detecting the virus (or its fragments) is not what concerns us.
8748,It's the state of illness that concerns us.
8749,We harbor the microbes of a hundred diseases without becoming ill. That's normal.

8895,"We've become more and more polarized over the last few decades, with credit mostly going to our two-party system of government and sensationalized ""news"" media."
8896,Now everyone thinks anything and everything is fake if the other party or other news network claims it as truth.
8897,"This escalated to the point where because one side is pro-science, wants to fight climate change, believes healthcare should be affordable and accessible, wants higher education to be attainable without crippling life-long debt; that those on the other side now consider those concepts ""anti american""."
8898,So you can see how fighting a pandemic when 1/2 the country doesn't believe in science or value human health could pose such a challenge.
8899,"Oh and of course the right is the ""freedom"" party too, and wearing masks or being told what to do and where to go is equivalent to being imprisoned to them."

8914,"In terms of the USA you may be thinking of [this recent PEW Research](https://www.pewresearch.org/science/2020/12/03/intent-to-get-a-covid-19-vaccine-rises-to-60-as-confidence-in-research-and-development-process-increases/) survey where 39% of those surveyed said they ""would not get the vaccine""."
8915,Were this to hold steady the US effort would be a failure.
8916,"The situation, however, isn't as grim as it seems."
8917,If you look at the survey in the link above 46% of those in the 'no' category would 'possibly get the vaccine' once more people had done so and there was more information available.
8918,If you add said percentage to the 60% who already say they would definitely or probably get the vaccine then the total in the 'yes' category rises to (60 + 18) = 78%.
8919,Of course not all of the 18% who say they 'might' will go ahead.
8920,Also a 78% uptake is dicey in terms of the goal of eliminating community transmission.
8921,Dicey but not impossible.
8922,Opinions vary on what level of uptake is necessary to make a vaccination program a success.
8923,Here's [an article from the Lancet](https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(20)32318-7/fulltext) where the author opines that an uptake of greater than 60 to 70% is necessary !!
8924,!with a 100% effective vaccine!!!.
8925,Given the reported efficacies of various vaccines this rises to 80%.
8926,"As I said, dicey."

I think your actual question, though, is the same as mine - If Pfizer reported 90%+ efficacy on November 9, and applied for Emergency Use Authorization on November 20, why did the FDA need to wait until December 10 to make a decision, right when the virus is hitting the worst it ever has?"

**Pfizer has told the Trump administration it cannot provide substantial additional doses of its coronavirus vaccine until late June or July because other countries have rushed to buy up most of its supply, according to multiple individuals familiar with the situation."
9461,"**

That means the U.S. government may not be able to ramp up as rapidly as it had expected from the 100 million doses of the Pfizer vaccine that it purchased earlier this year, raising questions about whether it can keep to its aggressive schedule to vaccinate most Americans by late spring or early summer."
9462,"Trump administration officials denied there would be availability issues in the second quarter, citing other vaccines in the pipeline, but others said problems are possible."
9463,"“I’m not concerned about our ability to buy vaccines to offer to all of the American public,” Gen. Paul Ostrowski, who oversees logistics for Operation Warp Speed, the government’s initiative to expedite vaccine development, said in an interview Monday."
9464,“It’s clear that Pfizer made plans with other countries.
9465,Many have been announced.
9466,"We understand those pieces.”

But several officials knowledgeable about the contracts said that supplies from other companies may be insufficient to fill the gap, depending on what other vaccines have been authorized by then."
9467,"**Pfizer officials had urged Operation Warp Speed to initially purchase 200 million doses, or enough for the two-shot regimen for 100 million people last summer, according to people knowledgeable about the issue who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they weren’t authorized to discuss the situation."
9468,"But the Warp Speed officials declined, opting instead for 100 million doses, they said."
9469,"**

“Anyone who wanted to sell us … without an [FDA] approval, hundreds of millions of doses back in July and August, was just not going to get the government’s money,” said a senior administration official."
9470,"But last weekend, with an FDA clearance expected any day, federal officials reached out to the company asking to buy another 100 million doses."
9471,"By then, Pfizer said it had committed the supply elsewhere and suggested elevating the conversation to “a high level discussion,” said a person familiar with the talks who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to share the conversation."
9472,"Pfizer said the company would be able to provide only 50 million doses at the end of that quarter, and another 50 million doses in the third quarter, the individuals said."
9473,"The government had a different type of contract with Pfizer than with other companies involved with Operation Warp Speed, the administration’s effort to speed development of vaccines."
9474,"Pfizer was the only company that did not take government money for research and development, which meant U.S. officials have had less insight into its decisions than it does with the other companies, said a senior administration official familiar with the matter who spoke on the condition of anonymity."
9475,The government had purchased 100 million doses of Pfizer’s vaccine with an option to purchase another 500 million.
9476,"Government officials believed at least some of those additional doses would be available when they went to purchase them, the official added."
9477,"Pfizer spokeswoman Amy Rose declined to confirm or deny the information and said that beyond the first 100 million doses the U.S. has secured, a separate agreement would have to be reached."
9478,"“The company is not able to comment on any confidential discussions that may be taking place with the U.S. government,” Rose said."
9479,"President Trump is expected to sign an executive order Tuesday that would prioritize vaccinating Americans before providing doses to other countries, according to a senior administration official who requested anonymity because he was not authorized to speak about the plans."
9480,Fox News first reported the executive order.
9481,"It is not clear whether the order is related to the Pfizer supply issue, or whether the president can prevent an American company from fulfilling lawful contracts with other countries."
9482,The order will be announced as part of a White House “vaccine summit” designed to highlight the administration’s accomplishments on vaccines.
9483,"“The executive order reaffirms to the American people that we are going to put America first,” said a senior administration official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to discuss the issue publicly."
9484,"The vaccine by Pfizer and German biotech firm BioNTech is expected to receive emergency authorization from the Food and Drug Administration in the next several days, and Moderna is lined up for clearance shortly after that."
9485,"Shipments of the vaccines will begin within 24 hours of the approvals, federal officials have said."
9486,"Warp Speed officials hope that other companies with promising vaccine candidates — including Johnson &amp; Johnson — will provide what’s needed but some of those companies are still conducting late-stage clinical trials, while others haven’t started them."
9487,That means there are several weeks to months before the companies are ready to submit an application to the FDA for emergency authorization.
9488,"One of the companies, AztraZeneca recently reported vaccine data that was encouraging, but experts raised questions about the data and what it meant about the efficacy of the vaccine."
9489,"Moncef Slaoui, chief science adviser to Warp Speed, said in an interview Monday that the U.S. government strategy was to spread its risk widely over many different types of vaccines from different manufacturers."
9490,"He declined to comment on negotiations with any company, including Pfizer."
9491,"**But he said he did not believe there would be any kind of vaccine “cliff,” where the available doses would fall off sharply."
9492,"Slaoui said that Johnson &amp; Johnson was likely to report trial results in early January and be ready to ship doses in February, if its vaccine is authorized."
9493,He predicted that AstraZeneca’s trial would report results in late January or early February and potentially begin providing doses later that month.
9494,"**

“Specifically this means we can have more Moderna vaccine doses, more Pfizer vaccine doses, more Johnson &amp; Johnson vaccine doses and AstraZeneca doses for the foreseeable future,” Slaoui said."
9495,“We could have all of them.
9496,"And for this reason, we feel confident we could cover the needs without a specific cliff … We have planned things in such a way as we would indeed avoid a cliff.”

The contract that Pfizer signed with the government in July was to deliver 100 million doses of a vaccine, and contained an option to request up to an additional 500 million doses."
9497,"Those doses will begin being shipped to communities across the country within 24 hours of FDA approval, which could come as early as this week."
9498,"“Pfizer shall inform the Government of appropriate lead times based on purchase of raw materials, capacity reservation and other factors, and Pfizer and the Government shall mutually agree on an appropriate estimated delivery schedule,” the contract states."
9499,"“Recognizing the urgency of the need, our manufacturing teams have been working around-the-clock so we can bring the vaccine to the world as quickly, efficiently and equitably as possible,” Rose said."
9500,"Additional doses would be “subject to a separate and mutually acceptable agreement” and the company could not comment on confidential negotiations that might be taking place with the U.S. government, she said."
9501,"**No agreements with Moderna beyond its initial contract have been announced, but the U.S. has the option to purchase 400 million additional doses, at a cost of $16.50 per dose."

currently living in japan, japan does NOT have it under control,
its been ramping up since october and at its worst right now

although whats different might be the fact that japan originally had a culture around mask usage, slowing the spread, but the government here is not doing anything to prevent, infact theyve been doign these stupid campaigns to promote people to travel/eat-out in some sort of act to help the economy

edit: also signs promoting washing hands to prevent flu spread have always been a thing here"

9620,Most Americans are wearing masks.
9621,The delivery of flu vaccines is very good (according to the CDC).
9622,Most people have adopted better personal hygiene.
9623,More people are  staying put.
9624,Here is the question.
9625,Why were the cases of influenza still higher and why is FLU still spreading now as high as it is.
9626,I would expect flu numbers to be significantly lower.
9627,"I know the CDC FLU case numbers are delayed and do not become accurate until 6-8 weeks have passed, but even the preliminary numbers of FLU cases are very high."
9628,"Their early detection system is still picking up hot spots, and before you make it political - some hot spots are places that voted for BOTH major presidential candidates."

9632,I'm with that as long as everyone's still masked up at the grocery store.

10160,Guys I wouldnt take this as 100% truth.
10161,"The White House is currently denying the claims, I would wait a while and see what comes from it, and if it's true, because the only ones that reported on It were the NYT."
10162,But an administration official said nobody turned down additional Pfizer doses.
10163,"The official said the U.S. has contracts with five other companies for a combined guarantee of 3 billion doses, as well as the option for more."

10169,Governor Whitmer 100% KNEW 22 days ago that she would be extending the restrictions.
10170,"Yet, she didn't have the guts to be fully transparent about that."
10171,That is poor leadership.
10172,"Unfortunately, many people are falling for this, thinking it IS ""good leadership."""
10173,Those folk are wrong.
10174,Transparency is a part of good leadership.
10175,"You mean ""the manhattan project 2.0"""

Look I can do it too!"
10196,Neat!
10197,But it is a little fucked that there are now a growing number of thousands whose last words were “it’s all a hoax I don’t believe I have covid” and then die.
10198,"You guys just keep telling yourselves it’s no big deal, even right before you kick the bucket."
10199,"That’s what produces these articles, your continued minimization, denial, and sharing of absolutely misleading stats."
10200,"And every day another 5 fully booked 737s of people die, and I wonder how many of them whisper to themselves at night aaaaaaall the cute little things deniers are saying: “oh it won’t get me I’m not old or fat!"
10201,It’s only a .0000000000000001% death rate I heard!
10202,No young people!

10219,"In the context of firefighters infecting people, I don’t think the poster meant herd immunity."
10220,The vaccine itself hasn’t been tested to see if it gives sterilizing immunity.
10221,Pfizer hasn’t and I doubt Moderna has yet.
10222,They’ve barely been able to get the data they have to get to request emergency approvals.
10223,Just in time to suppress information when the positive infection rate and death rate are growing to be at their worst this winter.
10224,Soviet Russia has come to Florida.
10225,States really should not be allowing weddings.
10226,"If they are illegal, vendors can't legally perform on contracts and so refusing to refund or reschedule would be indefensible."

10228,"I'm getting married next summer, and all of my vendors have said they allow rescheduling with no fee (but I would forfeit my deposit if I cancelled)."

10244,"Just wait until she has to deal with her pension and reciprocal taxation, and starts getting a flood of unintelligible letters from the Finanzamt ;)"
10245,At least the death toll was kept relatively low.
10246,"(Checks figures) scratch that, tomorrow the US surpasses their World War 2 combat deaths of 291,557."
10247,"For perspective their World War 2 deaths occurred over a period of 45 months (6,479 per month) as opposed to COVID over 10 months (29,032 per month)."
10248,"Hey, this reminds me of China!"
10249,Nothing to see here.
10250,Just some data we don’t want y’all to see.
10251,"You have to prove damages to sue; you can't sue just because they did something wrong, they must do something wrong **and** which cost you money."
10252,"And, it must cost you money in a way that isn't allowed (like they can detain you for days for no reason and make you lose your job, but that's allowed; and they are allowed to break stuff on the way in, or harm you in order to get in - even if that's completely unnecessary)."
10253,Move the first 2 Home Alone movies into the do it yourself section.
10254,I just wanna cry.
10255,"Even though my family employed as essential workers we still aren’t in the bracket of essential, like grocery store workers."

10257,"Guns drawn at her own house, with her own little kids and husband minding their business in the comfort of their own home and get some squad of shit bag cops with their guns drawn."
10258,All of this for Jones exposing the truth of the scientific data?
10259,Even in the UK you aren’t supposed to get a test unless you are symptomatic
10260,"Literally zero, Saudis, UAE, Lebanon, Egypt"
10261,That can actually get you in a ton of trouble even in shitty ole Florida.
10262,Desantis is a FACIST
10263,Well said.
10264,Neither do I.

10271,We.
10272,Are.
10273,A.
10274,Joke.
10275,You're just blindly spewing talking points without stopping to think.
10276,"First off, proven safe by the manufacturer is ***hugely important."
10277,*** The government is really just double-checking their work.
10278,"Secondly, it's scientifically false that ""it's happening as safely and quickly as possible."""
10279,"We know that, because the UK has already approved the vaccine."
10280,"Either the UK isn't being safe, or we're not acting as quickly a possible."
10281,Which one is it?
10282,Yeah I really doubt this is gonna sit well.
10283,Biden will have to do a lot of damage control with Canada and Europe in January.
10284,And that might mean losing an even larger number of vaccines for the USA.

10439,Unfortunately most cops will find it impossible to be unbiased (as support by racial profiling statistics).
10440,Serious question: what is the motivation behind this?
10441,Why would anyone be bothered by transparency when we fight against something together?
10442,"Yeah its funny how if you look into the arguments against challenge trials, they all boil down to ""it won't be allowed"" or ""it won't be ethical""."
10443,Haven't seen a single counter-argument that actually presumed the trial would be approved and then went on to discuss the practicality of it.
10444,Does measures even matter at this point when discussing this?
10445,The CDC claims 100 million Americans have already contracted Covid.
10446,Can’t we just compare that to the annual numbers of those that catch the flu?
10447,"I mean, all the data is there."

10501,"Don’t take this verbatim, but this is my understanding from an article I recently read."
10502,Moderna started their company a few years ago essentially on the basis of this new technology for developing vaccines.
10503,Since then they have been perfecting the method.
10504,"They had reached the point where they were going to start idk, like a pandemic mock-up trial—going through all the motions of the work that would need to be done in the case of a virus emerging."
10505,"In a weird moment of serendipity, that’s around the time that news of a novel virus in China was starting to get out."
10506,"So, instead of doing a mock-up, they turned their efforts toward the real thing."
10507,"How the tech works is they sequenced the genome of the virus then put that info into a computer, which is able to go through every line of genetic code and identify proteins that can be used as a vaccine."
10508,I believe the design of the vaccine only took 2 days.
10509,Developing a vaccine that was safe to administer to humans took only 42 days.
10510,"Without the computer doing the work for us, those initial steps can take multiple years."
10511,Being able to do the initial steps insanely quickly has allowed this last year to be dedicated to all the ensuing trial and safety steps.

10586,One of the nurses who took care of me said one third of the nurses and physicians working on the Covid floors had Covid.
10587,Think about that - they are maxed out in protective gear with their own oxygen supply and they STILL got Covid.

10682,"And the municipalities of Fredericia, Kolding and Vejle are another 330,000 people."

10747,"Technically, it's not an ""approval vote"" on Thursday, rather advice to the FDA who have the final say."
10748,"However, assuming no unexpected data, I assume a strong yes vote for the EUA followed by swift authorization, perhaps even the same day."
10749,Almost 65% of eligible voters voted in 2020.
10750,Pretty clear most do care.
10751,I would think so too.

10773,Agreed.
10774,With all the fearmongering you’d think people would be wise enough to do something to combat that too.
10775,The article says none of the vaccines are fully trustworthy.
10776,Would you have preferred the US not buy any?
10777,I’m confused here.
10778,"Obviously, we do not know the long-term effects of any vaccine produced yet."
10779,What would you have preferred the US do differently?
10780,I don’t think it would have been smart to throw all the eggs in one basket.
10781,"Also, let’s say we had 600 million doses today."
10782,How long would it take to get those out to the public?
10783,Are you also one to argue the “rich” countries shouldn’t be buying up all the vaccines too?
10784,Its damned if you do and dammed if you don’t.
10785,This is unprecedented and the fact that the US has secured more doses than required is a good thing.

10893,Rebekah Jones is the data scientist that was fired by DeSantis for reporting numbers he did not like and went on to create the Florida COVID dashboard.
10894,You sound like you don’t believe that the government should tax people.
10895,I’ve blocked you btw.
10896,Oxfords US data hasn’t even come out.
10897,If it has a decent effectiveness it will likely be approved too.
10898,How many years would pass under these circumstances until you would consider playing again?
10899,100% right.

10910,We quit going out to eat years ago.

10912,"You can buy the same cuts of meat and make it at home..

.. and as I’m typing this I realize not everyone is lucky enough to be able to own a home where they can have multiple grilling and smoking setups or confectioners ovens etc."
10913,If I couldn’t make the food for my family that I’m able to right now I’d probably be missing dining out as well.
10914,That sure was a walk down foot in mouth lane.
10915,We should be able to personally sue individual anti-maskers for killing people if we can’t just send them to prison.
10916,Is that not always the way in the US?
10917,I was in Asia when the tsunami hit Indonesia and Thailand and the news showed the horrific scene.
10918,Back in the US it was a crying woman holding her alive baby and interviews with white tourists.

10934,Literally one of the worst catastrophes in human history.
10935,Ever hear of nuance?
10936,"Also kind of funny for you to say in one comment you're not familiar with America, then turn around and make a sweeping generalization about what America values and how that somehow justifies the current state of affairs."
10937,You're getting downvoted because people have explained over and over again why COVID is bad even in the context of total deaths and have pointed out that at least one thing you've mentioned is entirely made up.
10938,"That ""some would have died this year"" is a goalpost moving of the absurd ""most would have died this year anyway"" nonsense that ignores the reality that the average loss in life expectancy is over 10 years, not 1."
10939,"You mentioned focusing only on deaths isn't a good metric, and yet conveniently leave out that for many of the survivors, there are lasting health impacts."
10940,You are leaving out that the rate at which people are in hospital has impacts even on people who don't have COVID.
10941,Quality of care drops for everyone who ends up there in one way or the other.
10942,You are absolutely minimizing the deaths of people who have died or will die of COVID.
10943,That is ultimately why you are being downvoted.
10944,"No it does us no good being panicked into irrational behavior, but its thanks to individuals like you constantly downplaying the pandemic that we are stuck where we are in the first place."
10945,"YOU might not worry because you either dont know (or dont care about) anyone whos possibly in danger, but YOU can still directly impact someone elses life because youre too self centered to see that."
10946,"Theres absolutely a discussion to be had about governments forcing shutdowns without financial aid, but that discussion can and should be had without waving aside needless deaths."
10947,"CA is the most populated state with 40 million people, they're getting only 327k vaccines in the first wave."
10948,Kushner.
10949,"Not only did you not read the very short article, you didn’t even read the first sentence."
10950,"“
A 90-year-old woman from Northern Ireland has become the first person in the world to receive the Pfizer/BioNTech Covid vaccine outside trial conditions”

But I’m guessing you won’t even the oh so long sentence I copied and pasted."
10951,I've had relatives 70 years old who recovered without any side effects tho
10952,Dont let em break you down Kramer
10953,"I used to hate masks, but I've become used to them."
10954,I haven't caught a cold at all this year probably because everyone is masked up and disinfecting hands.
10955,"(I live in Japan)

I don't have to wear lipstick, which I hate more than masks."
10956,Masks have their good points.
10957,"I’m saying when the people most vulnerable to covid get vaccinated, end this and let us get back to the world."
10958,The costs of doing this and destroying our society is going to be felt for a long time.
10959,The most high risk people are not an secret.
10960,"Sadly we cannot guarantee a good outcome to anyone, even someone low risk."
10961,"Low risk people die of other viruses sometimes too, like the flu."
10962,It’s very sad.
10963,But crusading against a virus with the aim of banishing it is stupid.
10964,It’ll be spring (covid seems at least a little seasonal) and the high risk will be vaccinated.
10965,Open.
10966,Up.
10967,Then.
10968,"Someone’s not going to be dining in public, seeing movies, boarding planes or... anything else in public, really."
10969,Well fuck...
10970,Not really.
10971,"I'm really skeptical about this vaccine, so I'm not saying I'll never take it, but I'll take it after everyone else has taken it and show no effects for a year or so."
10972,I'm up to date on my vaccines but pushing a vaccine developed in a matter of few months makes me uncomfortable

10983,[deleted]
10984,"&gt;Believe me, governments will try."
10985,"And if they do, we need to resist them every step of the way."
10986,"Let's be realistic 2 minutes, most government already postponed the second lockdown because economy cannot afford it even in the countries rich enough to afford a first lockdown."
10987,Why would they push for a second set of social distancing ?
10988,Reparations for black people first though.
10989,"iirc for schools, we shut down primary schools and kindergartens then secondary schools but exceptions are made for students studying for public exams."
10990,University students had some face-to-face classes (20-40 student classes) but not anymore.
10991,All primary and secondary classes were halfday
10992,Been a great couple of years so far
10993,"The wife was born in Germany but they both grew up in Germany, he moved to Germany with his parents when he was 4."
10994,"Are colds like to cause lifelong lung, kidney, liver, brain and heart damage?"
10995,I’d be happy to.
10996,"Surely you’re not suggesting that if the overall social costs of removing restrictions exceeds the social costs of maintaining them, we should lift them nonetheless?"
10997,It would in those circumstances do more harm than good.
10998,Cst scratch fever?
10999,Because people love getting dicked down by their governments in the name of safety.
11000,I could be wrong but I recall reading from the data released that some vaccinated still got covid 19 but I believe Moderna touted that they had had zero trial participants who developed servere symptoms.
11001,"1 down, 7 billion to go"
11002,Also don't forget that 24% of the US population is under 18 and essentially doesn't need to be vaccinated
11003,Only amazing if you don’t know Americans
11004,"It’s ok, most grocery stores will require it too."
11005,And planes.
11006,"Most public transit, really."
11007,Tons of places are going to make it mandatory.
11008,Have fun!
11009,The governor issued a mask mandate in July and renewed it when it expired.
11010,Unfortunately each county has the opportunity to opt out.
11011,The ones that have are mostly the rural areas.
11012,Once the weather starts to get warmer again I suspect we’ll see a huge change in people’s attitudes.
11013,"And while the vaccine news today wasn’t great, we should still have many of the vulnerable people vaccinated by then."
11014,"Just gotta make it 3-4 more months, then normalcy will start to make a big comeback."
11015,&gt; their experiences are similar.
11016,Well beyond keeping the schools open the experiences are wildly different I'd say.
11017,Even in the article OP linked to you see a classroom in Spain where both teacher as kids are wearing masks.
11018,"In and outside of school the situation is hard to compare: most EU countries have a lot of restrictions in place, mandatory mask wearing (and not just mandatory in name but enforced), social distancing and so on."
11019,What behaviour people are showing outside school of course can have a huge impact on what happens in school.
11020,"Bot EU as US screwed up big time by letting the rise in case in recent months go on for far too long without better measures, but as a teacher I guess I'd be more inclined to return to a job with safety measures in place than to a job without."
11021,I see your point and agree with a few things.
11022,"But, America is not a normal country by any means."
11023,"I personally think all production should stay here first, then export."
11024,The government needs to evoke the defense production act and get our population immunized as soon as possible.
11025,There is no reason the worlds superpower shouldn't and couldn't put their population first while at the same time immediately helping others afterwards.
11026,Correct.
11027,Both Pfizer and Moderna require two doses.
11028,Pfizer 21 days apart.
11029,Moderna 28 days apart.
11030,"So, enough doses for 20 million people."
11031,Phase 1A is Health care workers and long term care facilities.
11032,"My dad is a sick and elderly doctor, extremely high risk."
11033,Hes convinced we have another year of this crap.
11034,That infuriates him.
11035,He wants his grandchildren to have a normal childhood.
11036,"But every time I express optimism it’ll end soon, he shuts me down."
11037,And he has treated respiratory viruses and lung diseases for decades.
11038,He’s a real peach right now.
11039,That sounds like biological terrorism.
11040,I hope that anyone carrying forged cards spends a few decades in federal prison.
11041,At some point if this trajectory is continued there will be no more help to seek.
11042,We already saw some people told to go home to die due to lack of ICU capacity locally.
11043,I-O!
11044,"It's from a UK news site, so it's both the first person in the UK to receive Pfizer (other vaccines have been tested here) and the first in the world to receive an approved one."
11045,Agree that could be seen as misleading but didn't want to edit the headline given.
11046,Why would they show up?
11047,So Trump could try and hog all the credit?
11048,"In other news, Trump declined to buy enough Pfizer vaccine dosages to cover more than 15% of the population."

11052,Cool.
11053,Cheers!
11054,!remindme 1 year
11055,"Nazis gonna nazi, yeah."
11056,Why?
11057,What has a white house vaccine summit got to do with confidence in the vaccine?
11058,The lame duck president wants a photo op where he can take credit for their work.
11059,That's all the vaccine summit will be.
11060,It's better that they skipped it.
11061,"You're thinking too hard about this, you should just have another drink"
11062,It’s Pfizer.
11063,I would imagine they exactly as the please.
11064,No matter who’s in office.
11065,Even people that I thought were super conscientious and taking this seriously I find are travelling all the way across the country for pleasure trips.
11066,I'm really pulling my hair out at this point trying to wrap my head around human behavior.
11067,"People have been asked to change their behavior and alter their plans for a year, ONE YEAR."
11068,"Not a decade, not their entire life, ONE YEAR."
11069,I just don't get why this is so difficult for some.
11070,Americans want what they want when they want it.
11071,This truly is the century of self.
11072,"Some do, others end up stented or with an open bypass."
11073,Unless there are no resources at the hospital or EMS to transport them.
11074,Then you take a survivable thing and make it deadly
11075,Vaccine program begins today in the UK.
11076,"- Initially 70 hospital hubs but will expand to larger vaccination centres when more vaccine is available

- Currently being offered to over 80s, health and care staff

- Vaccination not compulsory 

- 800,000 doses to start with, aim for 4m arriving in UK by end of year."
11077,"UK has ordered 40m doses of Pfizer (vaccinates 20m) but has ordered for other vaccines not yet approved, most notably Oxford."
11078,- Care home residents not vaccinated yet as logistical challenges of transporting vaccine at required temperature still being worked out.
11079,So have we changed our minds about plastic now?
11080,You couldn't do this with paper
11081,You won’t be shopping vaccines.
11082,"Whatever your “moral issues” are (which it seems like that’s what you want to talk about, so just get on with it), if you want a vaccine, you’ll take what’s offered."
11083,Just tell them it's a million times harder to get that toilet paper...

11091,Just a shame we have another mess of a situation coming soon.
11092,What a wicked person.
11093,I hope they aren't in a position to hurt/rob anyone else.
11094,":(

I'm suddenly wondering if my grandfather's missing turquoise bear necklace is actually missing..."
11095,Good luck with that!
11096,"Ok, then you’re free to be fired."
11097,It’s that simple.
11098,"Capitalism made the rules, and you have to comply or get fired."
11099,[deleted]
11100,I ignored any news in Reddit
11101,It stinks and I think it's hard sometimes.
11102,I'm missing out on a year in college too.
11103,My ambitions in a sport got held up and I have to wait a longer to get my EMT license.
11104,"It's a hard situation and I am pretty upset that we're in this spot, but COVID is what it is."
11105,"I'm going to keep complying by the rules because COVID is obviously getting ridiculously bad, but my only real request is that by late March/April when the death rate should be theoretically near the floor we are permitted to go back to normal."
11106,I really hope you’re right.
11107,"If this bullshit lasts longer than this summer, my mental state is going to entirely
collapse."
11108,Barely holding on as is and the light at the end of the tunnel is really all I have.

11119,Being trans certainly isn’t a choice.
11120,Is that not kind of fake news?
11121,1st person received this vaccine months ago
11122,Define significantly worse please.
11123,The title isn't clickbait-y.
11124,"Maybe it's poorly worded and misleading, but it's not truly clickbait."
11125,The title describes what the article is actually about: how many people should be given the 40 million doses (e.g.
11126,are they split between 20 million people or one dose given to 40 million)?
11127,"He is ""immune"" already."

11133,*
11134,That sounds incredibly fulfilling
11135,Scary stuff
11136,"&gt;Data show return to classroom has had little impact on spread of Covid-19   
  
I wonder how much of that is because outside of school (and even in school in many places) mask wearing and social distancing is adhered to in general (there's only a few percent not adhering to the rules here, it's the relatively few nutters making the news)."
11137,"For example, mask wearing in stores is mandatory and close to 100% in countries like the Netherlands and Germany."
11138,"And there are more lock-down measures like restaurants are close for in person dining, bars are closed, no crowds allowed and so on."
11139,"What I mean to say, if people (students and parents) generally engage in risky behaviour outside of school, and there are few protective measures in place, I'd be reluctant to go back to in person teaching too."
11140,Masks work.
11141,Just look at the activities being banned.
11142,Most don't wear masks during gym or dining.
11143,... and you should still distance with the mask on.
11144,Section 8 cites and links to three different peer-reviewed studies.
11145,"My family understands ‘wear a mask’ at work, the grocery store, and at school."
11146,"But for some reason they don’t think its necessary to wear one when visiting the grandparents, birthday parties, Thanksgiving, or Christmas."
11147,"They’re usually very smart people, so it’s frustrating watching them split hairs about when they think the virus could be spread (in public) vs not (in small, private gatherings)."
11148,You mean like covid with its 99% survival rate?
11149,Tell that to all the shuttered businesses.
11150,HIPAA
11151,They don’t have to give a reason at all.
11152,It’s legally better for them if they don’t give one.
11153,I was in New Orleans until Katrina.
11154,I don't think people realize just HOW badly Bush fucked that one up.
11155,It was Trump level.
11156,"Five days after it hit and people were dying in the streets, the administration was still golfing and shoe shopping."
11157,Michael Brown was put in charge of FEMA because he used to throw lobbyist parties so Bush gave him a director position.
11158,"Before he was put in charge of national disaster management, the dude ran a horse show association."
11159,And was fired.
11160,If you have HBO watch the Spike Lee documentary.
11161,"Americans were horrified for about a week, but then moved on with their lives while it took New Orleans about a decade to rebuild."
11162,"Now we're stuck in a disaster that you can't drive away from, and we've been steeping in it for 9 months."
11163,Finally people get it.
11164,I saw a facebook aquaintance of mine has been in 4 weddings this year.
11165,Four!
11166,"She's attended at least 2 others, plus traveled extensively."
11167,Not a mask to be seen.
11168,She's also in the medical field.
11169,I just can't believe anyone would be that reckless.
11170,It makes my heart hurt and my brain rage.
11171,Yet somehow florida is fine
11172,"&gt; I haven't read the article

Kudos for having the bravery to admit this!"
11173,Reading the article is usually great idea before posting a comment in a reddit comments section.
11174,"This sounds extremely unethical to other countries, wow."
11175,"It all started when a certain leader politicized masks, sigh."
11176,"The ""Lockdown enthusiast"" crowd has been vocal in recent weeks, they desperately need this lifestyle to continue."
11177,"Their shut in style of living was bizarre pre-covid, now it's necessary."
11178,Once there's a vaccine their behavior becomes bizarre again and they desperately want to protect that social affirmation they're getting right now.
11179,"I'm not saying every pro-lockdown person is that way, a lot just want to make sure our healthcare system doesn't collapse, but there are a good number of people who are and they're usually pretty obvious."
11180,"I had some dude argue we should do this Lockdown every year for the flu last week, oh and he also thought that we should have a ""climate Lockdown"" it was just pathetic and sad."

11191,"If we get a billion signatures, maybe it will compel them to create a word that fits better."
11192,The film industry has been moving sets out of California for years before Covid.
11193,There is no clear evidence looking across countries and regions which clearly prove lockdowns are more effective than other mitigation measures.
11194,Try to find the evidence - not just a random country.
11195,I’ll wait.
11196,"Yes, that was a poor example because people were directed not to gather in groups and broke his own directive."
11197,He also continues to have his winery open and his kids in private school full time while others only have the virtual option.
11198,"In addition, restaurants had to close outdoor dining while they are allowing a film company to operate outdoor dining literally 50 feet away from a restaurant that falls under the outdoor shut down order."
11199,LA banned people from outdoor walks - there is literally no science or evidence of spread from people walking outdoors.
11200,There is little to no science behind several of their directives.
11201,I hope so.
11202,I work for a health insurance company and that would mean that they would mandate it for all of us too.
11203,I don’t want to go back into the office at all if the people around me aren’t vaccinated.

11245,I completely agree.
11246,No real point meeting with a lame duck president who can't even admit defeat.
11247,Might as well just wait until the loser is out of office.
11248,"Well, the US isn't the only country in the world, so it makes sense."
11249,Everyone has got to benefit from the vaccine.
11250,I would like to see the overall rise of the mortality on the statistics coming in March-May 2021.
11251,Quite a few European countries reports the biggest mortality rate since WWII or WWI like Sweden and Czech Republic.
11252,Literally more people died by the end of October than entire year 2019.
11253,Many statistics are not yet compiled until several months later.

11261,"Unfortunately in life, double standards more often than not fail to function both ways, and this example is one of them."
11262,"For the record, those comments about Jews were unbelievably anti-Semitic and I find them disgusting, but that example does nothing to somehow say that both races are treated with similar and comparable biases."
11263,This is a really stupid way of looking at things but I know that Reddit hates the rich to the point that if they got hemorrhoids they would find a way to blame rich people
11264,This argument is logical and is based on science and data.
11265,"We’ve learnt a lot about which populations are more likely to be affected by covid, require medical care, or die from it, yet we refuse to use that knowledge to create public health policies that are more specific and less detrimental to other aspects of our health."
11266,"Unfortunately we’ve spent the better part of a year being conditioned by the media, so called health experts and our peers, to the point where we’ve developed an unreasonable level of fear towards covid-19."

11309,The big issue is the uncertainty and nobody knows exactly when the Covid disruption would be over.
11310,"The society needs both nation-wide and regional contingency plan to deal with it, and this is really difficult time for many."
11311,Yeah but that's a much tougher sell when you're telling people they have to put their lives on hold and Lockdown.
11312,"""were making you shut down because you MIGHT have long term side effects, even though hospitals are mostly empty now"" that isn't going to fly."
11313,Paranoid of government overreach but Snowden is still wanted and nothing has really been done to address the violations of our rights.

11315,My last in person dining experience was at the IKEA restaurant back in March.
11316,"I've got a question that I can't seem to get an accurate answer about -

I took a PCR test on Wednesday that came back on Thursday as negative."
11317,My dorm roommate (separate rooms but shared bathroom/living room/kitchen) took a PCR test on Friday that came back on Sunday as positive.
11318,"She never had any symptoms, and couldn't identify a time where it would be likely that she would have contracted it."
11319,"As soon as she got tested, I went to go get a rapid test."
11320,"The doctor I administering the test said that results from a rapid test are unreliable unless you show symptoms since it just acts like a confirmation of like ""yeah, the symptoms of COVID you have, that's COVID""."
11321,I got a PCR test instead that has yet to come back.
11322,"Roommate gets a rapid test today, it comes back negative."
11323,The nurse at the place she got tested said that both PCR and rapid have the same rate of reliability.
11324,"I'm still going to get a PCR test tomorrow due to the exposure time and length that it takes symptoms to show up, but what is the reliability of either test?"
11325,"This has got me confused, are they actually both the same accuracy or is one better than the other?"
11326,"Just to make the situation a little more crazy, by the time she received the positive test result I was actually home since I had a doctors appointment today (that has now been rescheduled)."
11327,"I hadn't come face to face with her Thursday night since I was grinding out a paper, but I had seen her earlier and we share a bathroom, etc.."
11328,I go to school in NYC - my test result from tomorrow will probably come back Thursday.
11329,"If both are negative, and my roommate in fact was a false negative, is it worth it to head back to my dorm for the remainder of the semester (10 days?)."
11330,"I really want to see my friends before we all officially go home (it's also my roommates birthday), but I also don't want to risk getting sick and then being away from my family for the holidays."
11331,This is just kind of a question of WWYD?
11332,1/5 is the georgia election.
11333,I predict a shitshow between 1/5 and 1/20 regardless of the outcome.
11334,the only reason the republicans are behaving now is due to the election on 1/5.
11335,I feel like most people are refusing to accept that and they're still stuck in March when we thought it only spread through droplets and fomites like Ebola.
11336,Maybe Trump will invade Canada to get us more vaccines?
11337,/s
11338,"Sorry, but I stopped reading after I reached the paragraph where the author mentions that they’re not an epidemiologist, scientist, etc."

11341,Many researchers are just now launching follow-up studies: https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-02598-6
11342,There are lots of things you can do with extra money besides spending it one useless stuff
11343,So good that I and the  people sitting less than foot on both sides of me can eat and drink all at the same time and not be at risk?
11344,Or is this another example of how rules are different for big money corporations?
11345,If the filtration system is that good I think you've just solved our global pandemic!
11346,&gt; It will be politically and practically impossible to maintain social distancing and business restrictions in society once the real threat of a system overload is removed.
11347,"Believe me, governments will try."
11348,"And if they do, we need to resist them every step of the way."
11349,or that the virus even exists.
11350,"""It's just the flu."""
11351,"""I'm not dying from Covid."
11352,"It has to be something else."""
11353,"Like, WTF?"
11354,We have a representative republic; you are choosing representatives who...represent you.
11355,If you don’t know which candidates best represent your views then spend any amount of time looking it up.
11356,Local newspapers will generally have a decent guide though there are plenty of other more in-depth sources as well.
11357,O-H!
11358,I know at least one of them has already had it.
11359,Executive orders can do things.
11360,They can direct government agency to do things.
11361,But they can't just make things happen.
11362,Trump especially signs bogus executive orders that day they do something that sounds politically good but doesn't actually do any of the things to implement it.
11363,Appreciate it!
11364,Maybe I'll do it!
11365,That or try to be a steward in Antarctica for six months.
11366,"It was a new thing for me to witness, honestly."
11367,2020 brings out the worst in us.
11368,"Lemme guess:

Wear a fucking mask and stay the fuck home."
11369,Wear a fucking mask and stay the fuck home.
11370,Wear a fucking mask and stay the fuck home.
11371,Wear a fucking mask and stay the fuck home.
11372,Wear a fucking mask and stay the fuck home.
11373,Wear a fucking mask and stay the fuck home.
11374,Wear a fucking mask and stay the fuck home.
11375,Am I close?
11376,"Now that we have a different president next year, I wonder whether the new president will publicly declare that he will veto any such attempt no matter what."
11377,"That is the only way to determine whether this is simply a republican matter, or both parties are the same."
11378,and don't forget schools.
11379,The virus magically drops dead in the classroom /s.
11380,Yes.
11381,Cuomo and Murphy sent COVID patients into nursing homes and killed tens of thousands.
11382,NY/NJ currently has the world record for COVID deaths by a long shot.
11383,No place else even comes close.
11384,Only after 10pm.
11385,Also in CA.
11386,This time around no one is going to listen to the restrictions.
11387,Police departments are releasing statements about not enforcing restrictions.
11388,I wonder at what point people will listen.
11389,Maybe not even when ALL the hospitals are full.
11390,Who cares what he wants to do hes gone in 6 weeks

11393,"Not great, but better than some other countries."
11394,"You can GET fired for any reason, some of those may not be legal"
11395,It says we won’t ship out vaccines to other countries until everyone in the US is vaccinated
11396,The fascinating thing is that adenovirus vector vaccines themselves were only conceived 16 years ago.
11397,They're also practically brand new in the field of biochemistry.
11398,We are really reaping the benefits of cutting edge medical research here.
11399,You're showing your ass dude
11400,"OK, but just a second, we're all too angry to listen to this just yet"
11401,Bruh the vaccine was developed in Germany...
11402,How can air be real if our eyes aren't real?
11403,I’ve eaten indoors several times this year and am alive and well.
11404,Food for thought
11405,Jokes on them: Trump didn’t buy enough!
11406,"I guess it all depends on how we define ""middle""."
11407,"If we define it by time, well...no."
11408,It's still just the beginning.
11409,Definitely not by numerical infections...those are just ramping up to a brutal crescendo...
11410,I guess if the USA is lucky they're at the middle in terms of total deaths.
11411,But it seems an inappropriate use of the word lucky.
11412,"Do you really think we will have a lot of choice, like consumers browsing the vaccine aisle at Walgreens?"
11413,If I had my pick today I’d probably choose Pfizer but if that one is not on offer in my town when my risk tier is called up I’m not going to wait until 2022 so I can have a larger selection.
11414,Biden actually got 80 million votes.
11415,Get your facts right
11416,We shall see.
11417,We have a competent administration now at least who will do something about it
11418,It's not clear it isn't.
11419,At the very least they should be sued for negligence.
11420,Our moms are bad asses!
11421,I don't  think everyone knows the level of care (1:1 or 1:2) that ICU patients require.
11422,I also hope that your mom stays safe and healthy!
11423,"Exactly, the shitshow is just getting started."
11424,The real Trumpian Legacy.
11425,Ye it's going to be a serious clusterfuck.
11426,Hopefully Biden administration who actually takes this shit seriously will do something about it
11427,Did you catch them?
11428,Polio?
11429,I guarantee I'll die before I go to any of those places.
11430,No it's not.
11431,This would have cost 2 billion dollars.
11432,I would buy every vaccine there is that might even have a chance of working.
11433,"It's cost Trillions of dollars for the pandemic, literally any amount of money sold be worth it."
11434,An extra 2 billion should have been an easy yes
11435,"iirc there were restrictions already in place for schools, bars and restaurants at the same time."
11436,"But yes, we shut schools down first."
11437,edit: there were more students getting infected before patrons in bars and restaurants.
11438,Restaurants will only offer dine-in services til 6pm
11439,Even if everybody in the country could instantly become a millionaire if we kept the restrictions in place for another six weeks?
11440,I say that just to illustrate that this is a costs vs. benefits question.
11441,"Your demands seem quite arbitrary, maybe they’re just based on personal boredom or something."
11442,Really what you would have to demonstrate is that the net benefits of opening up would exceed the net benefits of maintaining the restrictions.
11443,No other approach makes sense.
11444,Rednecks/preppers/survivalist/Militias be like : MY TIME HAS COME!
11445,First in NI not world!
11446,Nothing in the news today changed any timeline

11506,"Well 'final' surge... maybe, but this tsunami of cases will keep going for months still."
11507,There's no reason for too much optimism I'm afraid.
11508,Two days ago: '100 million will be fully vaccinated by February' (so 200 million doses).
11509,"Today '40 million doses will be delivered to the US by end of the year', so that's 20 million people vaccinated as it takes two doses."
11510,But people still expect the roll-out of vaccinations to be soon and have effect on new cases on short term.

11532,I had two meds on that list that to this day still have the side effects and made my condition worse.
11533,Luckily there is another manufacturer working on a vaccine.
11534,Both are still rushed though 😭
11535,"It’s a vaccine, not a cure."
11536,Of course a vaccine won’t stop people who are already sick from dying.

11565,"&gt; Believe it or not, 99.9% under the age of 60 who get it will live

well, according to my math, that means 3 million US citizens under the age of 60 would die from it, if everyone got the virus."

11567,you do realize there are other vaccine candidates right?

11621,"Imagine unironically telling people to grow up yet you dont even have the common sense to notice COVID is being called a pandemic for a reason, its \*global\* and the only reason its even political is because your dear leader is a narcissist who decides whats right or wrong on a whim, and he decided he was right and the scientists are wrong."

11669,It has nothing to do with a lack of infections.
11670,Hospitals are overflowing and no one is allowed to report on it due to the State Secrets Act.
11671,"They want their precious Olympics, and they want it badly."
11672,"Death tolls aren't officially calculated for 10 years in the event of ""natural disasters"" (and pandemics fall under that umbrella), so they know they can get away with lying about it and covering it up."
11673,"They've been actively discouraging tests for months, and it's still very difficult to get tested unless you are in Tokyo or Osaka (or some other major city), or unless you're rich or have some important job that requires it."
11674,"Yes, people are masked up, like 90% of the time, but there are no lockdowns, no closures, and no social distancing."
11675,"Some businesses have opted to allow people to wfh, but many still do not."
11676,"There is no online schooling here except at the richest of international private schools, and even most of those aren't doing it."
11677,obviously that doesn't include orders.
11678,or do you really think there's not a single country on the planet who put down orders on a vaccine during a pandemic?
11679,Vaccine doesn’t have enough clinical trials what’s your point here?
11680,I don't think it's a problem.
11681,Just put blur on anything that could help identify the patient or doctor.
11682,"From what I've seen of American binge-drinking, it seems to involve taking 2% beers and smashing them over their head, then swigging the remaining dregs"
11683,Why did Moderna decide to make a vaccine of the same type if they knew Pfizer was on it?
11684,"I work in a restaurant, 95% of my friends are in the same industry."
11685,I truly believe we are a hot spot.
11686,"I would NOT eat in a restaurant right now, not even outside....A lot of my coworkers feel the same."
11687,"If you’re talking about the ball drop in Time’s Square, it’s not open to the public."
11688,There won’t be thousands of people standing shoulder to shoulder like we see every other year.
11689,"Having said that, I’m sure there will plenty of parties throughout the city (and country) on NYE."
11690,But they’ve already said they’re not doing the big Time’s Square celebration.
11691,"I agree but the statement from the head of vaccine development (sorry, mixed up the people) said:

&gt;”we have never taken any money from the US government, or from anyone”

I think that’s a bit disingenuous when they have a guaranteed payment of $2B from the US government lined up."
11692,"Perhaps you view it differently though, I guess it depends on how you interpret their statements on this topic"
11693,[removed]
11694,I worry about the long term effects on society because of this.
11695,"More drug abuse leads to more health issues, violence, unemployment, crime etc."
11696,The full effect wont be seen for decades.
11697,Not the first: thousands participated in clinical trials.
11698,This is surprisingly accurate
11699,Question would you take the day off work based on how bad your symptoms were or not?
11700,No end?
11701,A different ending?
11702,Do tell...
11703,"The policy of vaccinating the very oldest people (80+) first, in descending order, has the consequence of vaccinating far more women first since they live longer."
11704,The problem is men of a specific age have the same level of risk as a woman much older than themselves.
11705,This is why the virus kills many more men than women.
11706,About 2/3 of deaths are men.
11707,I can't help thinking a more efficient distribution scheme would have been to call age cohorts from each gender with the same level of risk as each other at the same time.
11708,e.g.
11709,vaccinate men in their 70s at the same time as women in their 80s (or whatever the matching age range would be).
11710,it possibly would have saved more lives.
11711,someone preordering your product vs someone funding your product is very different when it comes to politics.
11712,🤢🤢🤢🤢🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮
11713,Moderna (former employer FWIW) is also 1/6th the size of Pfizer and doesn't have their cash reserves.
11714,It was a huge risk for them to do what they did.
11715,"If the highly publicized vaccine failed during phase 2 or 3, it would have been very bad for them."
11716,"Incidentally, many/most drugs fail to get FDA approval for a variety of reasons."
11717,Both of these mRNA vaccines didn't... and we should be grateful for that.
11718,"The target was 50% effectiveness, which was surpassed even if you ignore the accidental half dose group."
11719,The vaccine also seems to present serious illness and death at the larger dose.
11720,The half dose warrants further investigation though.
11721,But that doesn't mean that until then it can't be used.
11722,Enough doses from each company to cover 70% of the population to get herd immunity.
11723,Suicides are increasing also.
11724,Depends on what state.
11725,Well nobody better let them forget how they’ve acted.
11726,They one great thing about their FAKE NEWS MEDIA is that it’s been documenting everything.
11727,Let’m talk shit.
11728,Astra still hasn't released any US data on the vaccine program.
11729,Hoping it was run much better in the states...
11730,And add the 10k disabilities that are accruing in the US everyday because of this.
11731,From my understanding the issue with the half dose was a limited portion of the phase 3 trial and doesn't invalidate the trial itself.
11732,"It does bring in to question how effective the vaccine is, but with the standard regimen it was around 70%."
11733,The 90% from half then full does being under 55s may skew those numbers.
11734,As to if further trials are necessary I guess we need to wait on those reviewing the vaccine to let us know what they think.
11735,The other vaccines that require extreme low temperatures are logistical nightmares for many countries so a much cheaper vaccine without those requirements is likely the hope of much of the developing world.
11736,Fantastic news!
11737,"Side note, it’s sad to see antivax rhetoric here already with just five comments at time of writing in this thread."
11738,"I haven't read the full statement but I guess they are going for ""even if an activity is allowed indoors, it is potentially unsafe""?"
11739,"Even if dining in is possible, it is a surefire way of getting it, if someone in the space is contagious."
11740,This is excellent news for all the developing countries in Asia and Africa that have signed up to this vaccine.
11741,This way those countries will not have to wait for Western vaccines as they can be vaccinated ata similar pace as the West.
11742,What are you even talking about?
11743,Smoking and drinking are keeping me entertained alongside my PlayStation.
11744,It’s like being back at college/uni but worse

11759,I hope you know the only way out of this now is HERD immunity.
11760,Either you get vaccinated or you will probably get covid at some point before we reach it.
11761,"Just as we don’t know what long term effects covid 19 might have, we also don’t know the long term effects of an mRNA Covid 19 vaccine either."
11762,So using your logic how do you decide what is more risky for you to get?
11763,How can doctors tell where an injection spot is?

11768,Pfizer has no choice but to honor agreements.
11769,He might have said that but it’s not really true.
11770,The US government has a $2B purchase order for their vaccine once it receives regulatory approval.
11771,"First of all, my entire family had Covid and I experienced the impact from pneumonia and hospitalization."

11827,Covid in the US?
11828,The reporting has suddenly become sterilized.

11832,"Technically, [yes](https://www.cdc.gov/media/releases/2020/p0714-americans-to-wear-masks.html)."
11833,"But a lot of people interpreted the original statements as “if I’m at a friend or family member’s house it’s fine to not wear a mask.” 

They’re making their original statements more clear."
11834,Wear a mask everywhere that isn’t your home...implying that indoor dining is unsafe.
11835,"I mean, yeah the math was super simplistic."
11836,"There's nothing wrong with simplistic napkin math, as long you're using it properly."
11837,"The people who were using it to doom scroll, and likewise the US government who used it as a ""baseline"" against which to compare themselves, were not using it properly."
11838,People who used it as a simplified upper-limit to give weight to the potential severity of a yet-unknown virus (most of the 2.2 million estimates I saw were back in february) were not entirely out of line.

11971,(Her death was unrelated to covid).
11972,"It was a great place, the food was amazing, it just wasn't the best time."
11973,This is absolutely heartbreaking and was 100% preventable.
11974,What a horrible tragedy.
11975,They were doing well before they opened up.
11976,"Rates are like 1/2 of California's, which is far from Taiwan or New Zealand."
11977,What do you mean you can exit the study if Pfizer is available to you?
11978,Like if you take part in the J&amp;J vaccine trial you can also take part in the pfizer vaccine trial?
11979,"It's shitty, but I'd expect every other country to do the same."
11980,You have to cover yourself first.
11981,"&gt;Congress needs to get their act together and pass another COVID-19 relief package

They hear you, so they gonna pass another bill that provide more loans to their lobbyist buddy."
11982,"Somehow, Kanye West's company would get PPP loan....again."
11983,"Even if there isn’t a lockdown, there are going to be a lot of ppl still who do not go back to their pre-Covid lives until they perceive it’s safe enough to do so."
11984,"Because it’s been so terribly managed in the US, there’s definitely some mistrust that exists."
11985,"I can still remember when ppl initially didn’t think Covid would spread via aerosols, and it took the CDC 6 months to conclude that it can be transmitted via aerosols."
11986,We don’t want to wait for herd immunity
11987,Wish the president work as hard for his citizen like he work for Covid.
11988,"Yeah, I did read it after."
11989,I commented to highlight how clickbaity the title was.
11990,What's the point in getting a reader all riled up before they read the article?
11991,It's 100% about profits and 0% about promoting discussion and growth in a reader group.
11992,It's like with essential workers.
11993,"Once it became known that there are benefits to being essential, you were hard pressed to find any professions that were not essential."
11994,I would not be surprised if we have 1 or 2 million health care workers in Washington state by next week.
11995,Anything that is shipped will only cover half the people - because it takes two doses.
11996,"For example if 20 million are delivered to a State in the USA, then that amount will only vaccinate 10 million people."
11997,Also it will take weeks to build immunity after each vaccination.
11998,People won't be able to go out immediately and stop wearing a mask and stop social distancing because they just got a vaccination.
11999,It will take several weeks after the first dose to build some immunity.
12000,Then a second vaccination is given and there will be needed time to stimulate the rest of the immune response.
12001,The production of lymphocytes takes time.
12002,It's possible that a person could catch Covid before the immune system gets a chance to develop a defense.
12003,"The second dose of Pfizer’s vaccine is given three weeks after the initial dose, and Moderna’s second vaccination is given four weeks after the first."
12004,"They can't be mixed, for example getting Pfizers first dose and substitute Moderna's for the second."
12005,"I have a bad feeling that people are going to say ""I got vaccinated and got it anyway!!!"""
12006,"That might happen to a few people, despite the +90% efficiency."
12007,People may not wait until their immunity gets a chance to build and respond.
12008,I think the point is that the fact we can't force them to work with other companies to produce more is bullshit.
12009,It may look decent from an outside perspective but restrictions here are bullshit.
12010,Personal freedom gets restricted like hell but schools remain open without masks.
12011,"No mandated home office, no restrictions in public transport other than masks."
12012,"Churches are open as usual 

They try to get the best results for minimum invest but that’s not how this works."
12013,"https://youtu.be/Tw9Ci2PZKZg

Mostly."
12014,You've never wondered why noone is talking about the complete absence of the flu this year?
12015,Its because its all being lumped in with covid.
12016,That is not slavery.
12017,There are people all over the world who are actually struggling with slavery.
12018,[removed]
12019,You not getting vaccinated will put co-workers’ family members at risk that might not be able to survive it.
12020,Them having to work with you is putting their family at risk to keep their job.
12021,Does that mean that their lives don’t matter because they aren’t your family?
12022,A fine worth one third of the minimum wage yearly pay isn't freedom.

12041,But I don’t like it.

12151,She said longtime patients have said they will never come back because clinic requires masks in the building and that their flu vaccine rate is at an all time low this year because a number of patients think the flu vaccine is filled with COVID/ some other conspiracy theory.
12152,This combined with the storage requirements for some of these vaccines meant She was not sanguine about getting enough people vaccinated for herd immunity.

12259,The population of the countries you mentioned are a fraction of the US.
12260,Canada for instance is nearly 1/10 the population of the US.
12261,"So optimistically, maybe 100k."
12262,"Part from literally shutting everything down 100%, which is logistically impossible, you'll still have people likely to catch it, even with proper precautions."
12263,[removed]
12264,Headline is false.
12265,"Thousands of patients have already received the Pfizer (among other) Covid vaccines, as part of trials."
12266,A recent article about the Moderna vaccine [We Had the Vaccine the Whole Time](https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2020/12/moderna-covid-19-vaccine-design.html) changes the vaccine success story.
12267,The /r/Coronavirus mods deleted it saying it was [low quality](https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/k8ktz5/we_had_the_vaccine_the_whole_time/).
12268,jesus christ imagine saying 300k dead americans is not important.
12269,thats more than half the population of wyoming.
12270,Before the end we'll probably have more dead than the population of some states.
12271,I'd rather lose everything and be depressed and suicidal than be dead.
12272,At leZt you have a chance to recover.
12273,i bet those 300k would have wanted that chance.
12274,"All your comments are basically saying is ""well I'M young and dont think covid will kill me and we should be focused on helping ME and not those other weaklings."""
12275,[removed]
12276,I've taken to smoking excessive amounts of weed...
12277,"But, hey, to each their own"
12278,Especially with cases naturally decreasing in summer times when people are outside more and there's less transmission.
12279,If we can reach our case numbers of last July/August and also have tens of millions vaccinated by then I find it very unlikely we'll see restrictions beyond that point.
12280,"Of course there may be localised restrictions for clusters found, as our testing numbers increase as well."
12281,I think by June 2021 we'll be back to normal in that the government aren't dictating how we live our lives.
12282,Plenty will still want to socially distance and wear masks and that's their right.
12283,"Still a long way to go, but if we can make it somewhat safely through Winter."
12284,"I just hope we reconsider the silly break of restrictions we're having over Christmas, it's simply not worth it now that we have a vaccine."
12285,What's shocking to me is that we have a such an effective vaccine well before we have any time of treatment.
12286,"Unless you're hospitalised, you're just fighting this off with basic over the counter pain killers, which is crazy to me."
12287,I feel like we don't have enough studies for treatments in the early cases.
12288,"Yup my mother in law got sick, she was really healthy ran marathons and all that jazz."
12289,Got placed on a vent back in march early april.

12296,*
12297,It’s based on the fact that 50% of covid deaths in the U.K. are in people aged over 80.
12298,I would argue preexisting health conditions.
12299,I am referring more to the 50-70 year old age bracket.
12300,"I've read two books about previous pandemics, both before this pandemic."
12301,They told of people dying at home and they couldn't do more than just shove them out the front door for a cart to come by and pick them up and take them to a mass grave.
12302,We are very close to this scenario.
12303,Hospitals are full.
12304,Morgues are full.
12305,Funeral homes are full.
12306,People will start dying at home and if no one checks on them because their own family are sick or dead or concerned for their own health they won't be found until much later.
12307,We haven't seen the worst of it yet.
12308,"I’ll be watching for 28 days, hopefully we don’t get rage zombies..."
12309,"Now just keep saying that every week, every day."
12310,So that that 5% of the population might finally get it.
12311,"How the *uck does UK start vaccinating their people, but the US hasn't?"
12312,Hope you’re right.
12313,Sadly the past year has laid bare the hubris combined with criminal incompetence of U.K. authorities.
12314,Worse in the world it seems...
12315,But hopefully they’re not all that bad.
12316,"I really like how your claim that covid might cause everything in the future, from Parkinson to infertility, doesn't come with a simple number or estimation of how ma y people are possibly affected."
12317,Talking about long term effects of a virus but the lockdowns long term effects can't be factored in.
12318,You know what also affects ethnic minorities?
12319,Poverty.
12320,Drug abuse.
12321,Violence.
12322,Discrimination.
12323,A lot of things lockdowns made worse.
12324,"BioNtech, Not Pfizer vaccine"
12325,"&gt; ""I have 50 first cousins"" 

Uuuh... assuming 3 kids per uncle/aunt, that's 16.67 aunts and uncles."
12326,An average of 8.34 siblings per parent.
12327,"That's somewhat unbelievable in this day and age, unless they're from India or something."
12328,"I mean, my mother grew up in rural communist Poland, and she has a grand total of 2 siblings."
12329,Even her parents did not have that many siblings.
12330,I'd rather have the mRNA vaccines but i know beggars can't be choosers.
12331,"Very safe, and you are somewhere in the middle of the line."
12332,Plenty of folks will nope out of their turn so hang in there.
12333,"There were no influenza pandemics that ""dwarf COVID."""
12334,The closest was the 1957-58 H2N2 Asian Flu; global COVID death totals have already eclipsed it by nearly half a million.
12335,"The AIDS crisis was indeed horrific, but has an entirely different of transmission, a duration of decades, and has caused 700,000 deaths in the US over a period of 40 years; COVID has already killed 283,000+ in just nine months."
12336,"This argument is spurious at best; these are all endemic, obesity and heart disease are not contagious and ""significant impact on human health"" is just bullshit."
12337,"&gt;measles, polio, obesity, heart disease, that have all had a much more significant impact on human health."
12338,"California implemented a tiered system specifically to provide a tailored, county-by-county approach to lifting restrictions."
12339,"It was based on clearly stated criteria, the data was readily available to the public, the governor provided daily press conference updates."
12340,Restrictions began to be lifted the first week in May with various accommodations to allow businesses to resume while mitigating transmission.
12341,"You don't give any examples, but ""kicked their legs out from underneath them"" has to be in reference to adjusting restrictions based on county case numbers."
12342,"If so, that's ridiculous framing."
12343,"Finally, there's this little gem of a straw man, which ironically makes the exact opposite point you think it does: The president of the United States utterly and completely abdicated his responsibility, literally doing worse than nothing - including, it turns out, rejecting Pfizer's offer of up to 500 million doses of vaccine in July of this year - making things worse at every turn and leaving the states to fend for themselves with the federal government getting in the way instead of giving support."
12344,"Given its location, population, and volume of international air traffic, California could easily have seen the kind of devastation NY and NJ did in the spring."
12345,"So, yeah, ""but the cases."""
12346,&gt;And I’m sure you’ll respond “but the cases.” What about them?
12347,California as a state has less deaths per population than the majority of the rest of the world.
12348,Still can be 'the first man' at least
12349,"So much for the ""back to normal in spring"" shit everyone was spamming last week."
12350,Patient not volunteer ya pedantic ass
12351,"Another 3,000 Europeans will die today, and the EMA is looking for approval in about 3 weeks..."
12352,Nobody is going to have to carry around a vaccine card.
12353,This is just Reddit stroking the kind of authoritarianism they like and agree with.
12354,"I don't think so, there is vocal minority but most people will vaccinate."
12355,Especially if right wing media will advocate this to the elderly.
12356,"Polaczki-cebulaczki are gullible, but not more so than other nations."
12357,This deserves more upvotes.
12358,Quantitative easing isn't what you think it is.
12359,"Feel like he was intentionally the 2nd, as it would take away from the serious achievement if all the responses to the breakthrough were puns!"
12360,Yeah that's fine I agree with you then.
12361,I've seen people go on about Britain be an incredible country because of this
12362,The basement dweller holdouts have begun!
12363,"It was in Brussels, not Budapest."
12364,"Nah, pretty much the opposite, the government was often one of the, if not the first country to preorder from a manufacturer - moderna CEO himself cleared that up"
12365,Unfortunately I am unable to read it
12366,"At the current rate, that's about 60k extra deaths."
12367,The MHRA is independent and has a great reputation.
12368,"If they've approved the vaccine, the odds are it's safe."
12369,I hope the European authorities will be held accountable for their refusal to act in a timely manner causing thousands of pointless additional deaths.
12370,Same.
12371,"January and February were so extremely tense, I could barely stand it."
12372,So nice to see some light at the end of the tunnel.
12373,... but Congress woulda paid twice that much /S
12374,"By that logic, all phases should prioritize women first, then children."
12375,It's a nice thought but the overall effect is incredibly sexist and ageist.
12376,We dont want to live in a world where this calculation is constantly ran in ER rooms and the like.
12377,"You see how that is a problem, yeah?"
12378,We don't need to vaccinate everyone though.
12379,After the majority of the vulnerable are vaccinated it'll hopefully be comparable to the flu or even less in terms of deaths and hospital admissions.
12380,"Even if we want elimination/herd immunity through vaccine rather than just protecting the vulnerable we'll only need 70-80% vaccinated i think 

Children also aren't being offered the vaccine"
12381,Preventative medicine is usually cheaper than treating those who become infected.
12382,It is certainly better for those who would otherwise be infected and spend a lengthy spell in hospital.
12383,"The flu vaccine is free for those over 60 (over 50 this year), school children, NHS staff and pregnant women and it is delivered in the community by nurses and pharmacists."
12384,Our local doctors surgery opens on weekends from October to December to get everyone seen.
12385,Well said Arsewipes

12400,Your guess is as good as mine there.
12401,"I think state/local govs will continue following whatever guidelines they have been using, but hard to say what 6 months from now will look like."
12402,"As for what companies themselves will choose to do, I don’t think they will require ppl to physically go into work, unless it’s absolutely necessary for the job."
12403,"As someone who works in an office in a densely populated city, I don’t think this will happen until majority of ppl are vaccinated."
12404,I easily come into close proximity with hundreds of ppl each day just taking public transportation and walking down the street.
12405,"If I had to travel for work again—I’m easily in close proximity with random ppl just in flights, taxi rides, and hotel stays alone."
12406,It was no surprise to me that NYC was the hotspot at first and then it spread out to other cities/states.
12407,it just depends on the leader.
12408,we have some effective leaders in states that just have less power than the incompetent federal
12409,we are already in the nightmare and realization will come late as always.
12410,This exacerbated by the fact that we Americans are not accustomed to be such failures at addressing issues and this is by far the worse we have ever responded to an emergency in our history.
12411,We all know why this happened and why its going to get much  worse in coming weeks
12412,That is the exact same article I linked.
12413,Only difference is that I linked the reddit post of that article in case people wanted to see those comments as well.
12414,I think we are in agreement as to why this is occurring.
12415,Joseph of Nazareth hates that Beyoncé song because his wife has never taken him to Red Lobster
12416,Our only hope is the vaccine.
12417,The people who take this seriously and try to mitigate the spread are doing those things now and have since the beginning.
12418,Why you gotta do me like that BBC
12419,"Ladies and Gentlemen, we got'em"
12420,How does that help?
12421,No one person should have so much power.
12422,"Even assuming ample supplies, mid-2021 is still overly optimistic."
12423,I'm figuring 2022 at best.
12424,Many people are going to avoid the various Covid-19 vaccines until there's more clarity of their safety.
12425,"Alternatively, some will take time to seek out a particular one they feel is safer."
12426,"On the flipside, some will seek out multiple Covid-19 vaccines figuring that will multiply their protection."
12427,"Health authorities, by and large, are assume one round of 2 shots per person."
12428,"I doubt the fraction of a percent who get multiple Covid-19 vaccines will matter, but it could if it becomes a trend."
12429,"Personally, I'm waiting it out awhile."
12430,"I'm not in one of the first eligible groups anyways, so the earliest I could get it would likely be Spring 2021, but will gladly wait until late 2021 or even 2022."
12431,"By then, the safety profile of each vaccine should be better known."
12432,"I've likely already had Covid-19, which further figures into my risk calculation."
12433,"Another issue is even very safe, time proven vaccines can have adverse effects in extremely rare instances."
12434,"Unfortunately, the U.S. National Vaccination Injury Compensation Program does NOT cover any Covid-19 vaccines."
12435,"While some believe it will upon FDA approvals, it appears the Public Readiness and Emergency Preparedness Act (PREP Act) act precludes that for an extended period of time."
12436,"Most people aren't going to consider injury liability protection, but some will."
12437,"https://www.phe.gov/Preparedness/legal/prepact/Pages/4-PREP-Act.aspx

Not an easy read."
12438,"It makes mention of the Countermeasures Injury Compensation Program, but that provides very limited compensation, such as lack of coverage for long-term medical care, in comparison to NVICP."
12439,But I digress.
12440,"In short, not only is it a matter of supplies, but also hesitancy of many to get vaccinated; waiting it out long as possible."
12441,"Eventually most, even if they don't really want to, will get vaccinated, but will stretch it out long as they can."
12442,2022 seems more realistic than 2021 for 50 to 75 percent of the U.S. population getting vaccinated.
12443,"If you are insured through your job, they will know"
12444,Depends on how J&amp;J and other ones.
12445,"Yeah you're right, my bad."

12460,There were several diplomats and a right wing Hungarian MP.
12461,No Budapest except as the place where said right wing politician resides.
12462,It’s pretty big.
12463,It’s the biggest Pharma company in the world (Johnson and johnson do other stuff too).
12464,My dad is very high up in Sanofi their competitor and he has faith in Pfizers ability to scale it up
12465,I am not denying scalability.
12466,I am saying it won't be easy.
12467,That's why governments worldwide are pinning hopes on multiple vaccines rather than a single one.
12468,"&gt;Hell, given how expensive the US medical system is they should be considering this China vaccine   

Given the fact that this vaccine is offered 30 dollars per dose, which is more expensive than the Biontech/Pfizer, why would they?"
12469,"I think it is because we subconsciously think of the virus as something ‘those people’ get, not something our families have."
12470,I have seen so many people in my own circle of friends act offended at the idea that they could possibly have it- as if you’re insinuating that they’re unclean.
12471,We do this bc the situation feels overwhelmingly scary and out of control... denying that it could be in our homes makes us feel safer.
12472,Is seriously frustrating tho
12473,The FDA still hasn't met yet.

12479,Agreed.
12480,Late Jan is what they're looking at for an efficacy readout in the US trial.
12481,If it proved to be effective there then we're in the money.
12482,Should be around the same time as J&amp;J as well.
12483,More vaccine for the rest of us!
12484,It comes down to patents and supply.
12485,"The Russian one, even if it is identical, will not have the same approval."
12486,"It might work, it might not."
12487,"The fact is they created a vaccine purely to ‘win’ the race, and they don’t have the ability to make enough of it."
12488,That’s 3 weeks later.
12489,"And any EU country could have done what the U.K. did, if they wanted, the U.K. is still subject to the same EU rules until 31 December."
12490,Frankly my gut feeling is the U.K. did not check properly to score political points with people like you.

12492,Jones was an early whistleblower who was promptly fired
12493,Sounds promising so far.
12494,Looks like there will be another viable vaccine soon.
12495,It is very different as vaccinations for yellow fever intend to protect the traveller from a risk present in the country and not the other way around.
12496,"Therefore, it is not needed or expected that every single human in the world will demand this vaccine and they are readily available."
12497,"Until now, for everyone bar a few grannies in the UK or doctors in Russia, a covid vaccine is not a choice."
12498,"We are months, if not years away from the point where vaccines will be available to most people."
12499,It is scary and potentially very dangerous that there are already talks about excluding most of the humanity from travelling through borders for something that isn't under their control.
12500,"As you rightly point regarding the yellow cards, there will be corruption, there will be black markets, there will be abuse of power and a lesson history teaches us is that the elite always finds a way through those things."
12501,People applauding those initiatives need to think again.
12502,"It is not about ""opening borders"", but closing them permanently"
12503,Well in the English world.
12504,Writing on the internet is littered with incorrect grammar and if you listened to how English speakers talk (especially North Americans) you will notice they pronounce words wrong but we still understand each other.
12505,"I’ve never said Iranians don’t deserve a vaccine what is implied that you guys should have known how cruel The Trump administration is and should’ve worked on sourcing your own vaccine like China and Russia 
I’m pretty sure China would’ve gotten the same treatment"
12506,Unfortunate but understandable.
12507,It's OK.
12508,It won't change the fact that the current White House encouraged the vaccine development in order to really fight against the virus.
12509,Hahahah it's the same fucking thing here at my company in MN.
12510,"Apparently at your desk, magically, it's safe to expel your germs for everyone to inhale."

12545,Yeah from memory it was the serious sub and this was the shitpost sub and then they swapped.
12546,Upvoted you because I don't think you should be downvoted for asking a question.
12547,I don't have the reason why but I presume risk of transmission of anything significant with a large viral load is pretty limited when it is simple brief hand to upper arm contact.
12548,The gloves would be to protect the wearer and them touching your upper arm is unlikely to result in anything too severe since it is not your face etc.
12549,"Just guesses here though, the other commenter provided better sources I don't have time to read."
12550,"I followed the links in that article and noticed they really made up a lot of things, I couldn't understand why."
12551,"So I decided to check out the website and there is a wiki on it, here is some of it:

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TRT_World

&gt; The network has received criticism for failing to meet accepted journalism ethics and standards for independence and objectivity, with some commentators especially in the West calling it a mouthpiece or propaganda arm of the Erdoğan administration."
12552,"[10][11][12] TRT World has stated that it is financially and editorially independent from the Turkish government, and that its news gathering and reporting activities are just like those of other publicly-funded broadcasters around the world, with a mission to show a non-Turkish audience events from Turkey's viewpoint."
12553,"[13][14][12] However, according to Reporters Without Borders, Turkey in 2020 ranked 154th out of 179 countries in press freedom."
12554,"[15]

&gt; In March 2020, the United States Justice Department required TRT World's Washington operation to register as an agent of the Government of Turkey, engaged in political activities, under the anti-propaganda Foreign Agents Registration Act."
12555,"TRT World's arguments that it is independent were rejected by the US officials, who found that the Turkish government ""exercises direction and control of TRT by regulation and oversight, and by controlling its leadership, budget, and content."
12556,"""[14] Apart from some Russian and Chinese networks, other state-funded media including the Qatari-backed Al Jazeera had not been determined to be foreign-government agents."
12557,"[16]

&gt; In a 2019 op-ed in The Washington Post, Middle East media expert Steven Stalinsky called TRT World ""a propaganda arm of Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan's regime"", similar to the Russian RT News network."
12558,"He notes that the channel offered only enthusiastically promotional coverage of the Turkish military's Operation Peace Spring in Syria, while according to the Committee to Protect Journalists, the government banned critical news coverage domestically."
12559,"Stalinsky urges human rights activists, journalists, and others not to appear on and legitimize the network's shows, just as they would not appear on RT."
12560,"[11]

&gt; Following the 2016 Turkish coup attempt, some journalists who had recently joined the company resigned."
12561,"[17][18] One of those who resigned said: ""I no longer hold out any hope that this channel will become what I wanted it to become (...) After the coup, it became very apparent that the channel had no intention of actually covering it properly, in a professional, international broadcast standard."""
12562,"The managing editor at the time said that he ""never received a phone call from Ankara trying to frame the broadcast or give them talking points."
12563,"""[19]

&gt; More recently as of March 2020 with the Evros border crisis, TRT World and other Turkish media have in a way, accelerated on producing fake news according to the Greek government, as was also mentioned by Prime Minister of Greece Kyriakos Mitsotakis in a CNN interview twice,[20] stating that the reports all come from Turkish media and other unknown sources aiming to discredit the Hellenic Coast Guard and Hellenic Armed Forces efforts with propaganda videos."
12564,"TRT World claimed that Greece sent back refugee vessels to Turkish waters, which was denied by Greece."
12565,[21]
12566,... but there are only 1000 sheets of paper /S
12567,If approved.
12568,They’re actually looking at it.
12569,"They would've had the antigens to diagnose COVID, so yes they probably did have it"
12570,"Take care of yourself, consume less media (including and especially this subreddit), and keep doing what you've been doing to keep yourself safe."
12571,That's it at this point.
12572,"Assume everyone else, even people you trust and care about, are vectors and already infected."
12573,"Anker, which IMO produces the best phone chargers and powerbanks in the world, is Chinese."
12574,I went through 6 charging cables including the original one (I use my phone while charging) in about a year.
12575,I purchased an Anker cable a year ago and it still works great.
12576,Same for the 12v socket fm bluetooth player from Xiaomi.
12577,"Went through 4 or 5 cheap ones in a couple of years, have had the Xiaomi one for over 3 years."
12578,"I'm not saying their vaccine is safe, we're gonna have to wait for some independent reviews, but China can create some quality stuff for a premium price, we're just used to buying cheap chinese crap and now associate china with lack of quality."
12579,I know a handful of people who got in car accidents and were totally fine.
12580,That's why I don't wear a seat belt and drive the wrong way down two-way streets.
12581,&gt; And no one will really care.
12582,We've all become so numb.
12583,Do we have any idea when AstraZeneca/Oxford will apply for an EUA with the U.S. FDA for their vaccine?
12584,"I heard they will be conducting another trial to get more efficacy data on the half-dose/full-dose regimen, but I’m not sure if that’s supposed to affect their timeline for approval and rollout?"
12585,"3 times a day for 70 days,  my dong 's like a pepperami"
12586,we did the same in Germany.
12587,"It stopped the exponential growth, but we are no stuck at high daily cases and it sucks."
12588,I suspect it has to do with schools being open.
12589,"Looking from the outside, from a country that has resolutely beaten COVID, I see in posts like yours further evidence that America has degenerated into a giant, open-air lunatic asylum."
12590,Our 'COVID-normal' is zero infections with high public vigilance.
12591,Your 'COVID-normal' is corpses piled sky-high and an utter disregard for human life.
12592,Missed that.
12593,You can catch it and your body does not develop antibodies.
12594,It's not a sure thing your body will do what we want it to
12595,Doctors surgery.
12596,Also known as the GP.
12597,The comment says they developed no detectable antibodies...
12598,Hey that's not fair to McDonald's.
12599,They also served RTs
12600,Your teachers and TAs are also struggling in this environment.
12601,"Source: Am TA, also struggling to teach as best I can."
12602,"I have school aged kids and my philosophy at this point is, if everyone is behind, then no one is behind."
12603,School next fall should be mostly normal and this year is just gonna have to be a mulligan.
12604,Just had mine 2 hours ago!
12605,Hoping this is the beginning of the end and we can start to return to some normality later next year 🤞
12606,Pfizer vaccine is all purchased until late next year.
12607,I don't have the article handle but it was in WaPo and NYT last night.
12608,We only get the vaccine we already purchased.
12609,"The ""options"" aren't worth anything because it's already sold."
12610,Forever ?
12611,You're getting approval on Thursday and vaccination is starting on Friday.
12612,Only 3 days later than the UK.
12613,Meanwhile we're getting approval in 3 weeks and vaccination is starting in January.
12614,Read the comment you replied to.
12615,"&gt; Florida police have raided the home of data scientist Rebekah Jones, who built the state's official Covid-19 database."
12616,Ms Jones has accused the US Department of Health of manipulating virus data in order to relax pandemic restrictions.
12617,"She posted a series of videos of the raid on Twitter, in which armed officers seized her phone and laptop."
12618,"The force said it was responding to a hack of the state's emergency health alert system, which Ms Jones denies."
12619,"Ms Jones was fired from her job at the Department of Health in May after making her accusations, and has since maintained her own database, independently tracking the spread of the virus."
12620,Shut up racist
12621,I feel like that number should be higher lol
12622,"&gt; those who say stuff like ""I trust science but not this (scientifically tested and approved) vaccine""

I've seen a bunch of those already around Reddit..."
12623,Including some guy who's claiming the vaccine targets the same spike protein used for creating placentas?
12624,"Like, what even..."

12634,"2 years from now, people will wonder, “why didn’t we just wait 3 more months to fully open schools?” The vaccine is coming and we are entering the most dangerous phase of the pandemic."
12635,I know so was i. I hope theres no such thing as a person that is jacked up on vaccines.
12636,But you’ve already had it.
12637,You would already have antibodies.
12638,I feel the whole system is backwards.
12639,We had 17 workers in one week test positive.
12640,"It used to be an automatic notification if you worked with someone who had symptoms and was testing, instead I find out after the fact I’ve had direct contact with three positives since 23rd but all were awaiting results."
12641,I thought we weren’t supposed to be out while waiting results.
12642,"Happy early birthday, mate!"
12643,"The analogy changes a bit if you point a loaded gun at me, force me to drive 25 miles a day, and tell me the 95% effective seat belt isn’t available to me for a couple months."

12645,I hope they are eventually sued into oblivion for this.
12646,Is there any info regarding what happens if patients take only one jab?
12647,I have a feeling that not everyone will go back for the second.
12648,No red flags is really important; it sounds like it's all but approved on Thursday.
12649,"While what you write is true, this 5000 per day goal is only so people can celebrate Christmas and new year."
12650,"And so the companies suffering from lockdown and bordering on rebellion (cinemas, events, shops etc) can also reopen to not loose the busiest month of the year."
12651,What do you think will happen if the government fix the goal as low as 100 per day as South Korea ?
12652,People will feel discouraged and feel like they have no way to achieve it.
12653,So most will just not care and will not work toward reaching it.
12654,The point is to fix achievable goals where most people accept the temporary restrictions.
12655,And reach more and more achievable goals before the vaccines (which start end of december).
12656,And also not face massive rebellion because there is no way French are spending Christmas without their family.
12657,"(Like most countries who celebrate it btw)

Final point is to not destroy the economy."
12658,"There is a fine line between keeping stuff open and locking everyone down, we are adjusting and numbers show that it works, albeit more slowly."
12659,But we aren't destroying our economy.
12660,On your point about speeches by Macron.
12661,There is no way they will ever admit they saw another wave coming or anything truly damning.
12662,It's admitting responsability and it's dangerous for the respect of futur government decisions.
12663,"I personnaly only listen for the new rules, any other explanation is damage control and official communication."
12664,"For the stupid pikachu faces, unless you are really living under a rock or deeply dellusional, there is no way you don't know what's gonna happen."
12665,People love to throw rocks at the government when it's mostly the overall population who doesn't abide by the rules.
12666,"Sorry, long message but we can't decently compare two countries who don't have the same rules, progression or even culture."
12667,Cancel the Christmas dinner and have a Biden victory party with gift giving instead.
12668,Celebrating our glorious leader is allowed in lockdown states.
12669,They'll give out doses to 40m people right away.
12670,"There is a 3-4 week wait between doses, it's not like they'll keep your second dose in the fridge that long just waiting for you to come back."
12671,"In the US, we have our own vetting."
12672,Which video?
12673,Where can I watch it?
12674,That's good to hear!
12675,Hope we can have it here in Europe soon.
12676,"So I understand that we will need to wait for a second jab, but does the first offer any prevention by itself in the meantime?"
12677,"Here in the US when all is said and done we’ll have lost more Americans to Covid than from any war, so we could just call ours Pandemic Memorial Day 😣

12722,What's the point of giving a vaccine to a patient?
12723,BioNTech/Pfizer vaccine has 1% point higher efficacy and 60% lower incidence of side-effects compared to Moderna.
12724,"So it's not worse, it just has much higher distribution requirements."
12725,Both are excellent vaccines with different advantages and both have set very high bar for other vaccines.
12726,Germany might actually do that.
12727,Many companies are closed from 24.12 till 06.01 anyway and schools are closed as well.

12809,"The accidentally ""wrong"" AZ dosage had ~90% efficacy."

12831,Are you her psychologist....
12832,Eternal gratitude to the brilliant scientists and brave trial volunteers who are making this historic moment possible!
12833,"They are soon delivering us from this horrible pandemic that has suspended civilisation, taken millions of lives, and upended even more livelihoods."
12834,God I love biomedical science.
12835,"Without it we'd still be living in the dark ages, plagued by other pathogenic horrors such as smallpox."
12836,"That really, really shows confidence in their vaccines."
12837,"If vaccines rely on herd immunity, then you will never have herd immunity because 50-60% of your population won't get vaccinated."
12838,"Besides that, people have been going in and out of the whitehouse, the bus, hospitals, grocery stores, stadiums and hundreds of other places without a vaccine for months."
12839,You are effectively telling me that I am at lower risk riding the bus without a vaccination then standing at a podium with 3 other people and social distancing rules after being vaccinated.
12840,"""get stupid""

It's an old issue that can only be solved with education in critical thinking; for some reason, it's not a topic of interest for those who plan school curriculum."
12841,"Nah, we just wont get any at all on any significant scale until next July."
12842,Gov DeSantis: drinking your tears.
12843,It’s not the risk of you doing .. it’s the risk of you spreading the virus to somebody that may die — you selfish fuck
12844,Does it matter at all what my tone is?
12845,You're the ones dying because your leaders can't/wont do the right thing.
12846,Save your outrage for them
12847,"ill take a crack, there are a few factors."
12848,"primarily, they fucked the economy and the environment."
12849,between refusing to take a loss on real estate and thereby inflating the cost of housing based on an entitlement to a return on investment - when theyve done nothing but pay interest for 15+ years.
12850,"it's impossible to live the life they preach at us to aspire to, and it's their fault."
12851,"Their attitude is terrible towards change and maybe its just the nature of technology, but they are often incapable of doing the most basic tasks if they involve a phone, computer, or the internet."
12852,"for whatever reason, they refuse to learn."
12853,you can teach them how to do something 100 times and they'll still ask for help.
12854,"Because of this, the tech sector has spent the last ten years on accessibility instead of enhancement, which causes inconvenience for those of us who know what they're doing."
12855,"I had a smartphone in 2010 with a 3d screen, a stereoscopic camera, mini hdmi out.. and just as much if not more functionality than my new phone ten years later."
12856,they only thing thats changed really is a bit more speed and a lot more dummy proof.
12857,we are going through a pandemic.
12858,ask your retail worker friends.
12859,who is coming in to browse and shop?
12860,is it young people?
12861,or is it old people who refuse to adapt and are afraid of amazon?
12862,My best friend manages a cellphone store.
12863,"He says since this all started, 95% of his customers are problem customers compared to 5% before - ans theyre all old people who haven't figured out the person at the cellphone store is literally just doing things using the interface you have access to if you log in yourself."
12864,"everything can be done either over the phone or online, but of course generation ME can't be arsed to figure out online shopping or curbside pickup."
12865,"my old man still doesnt know how to order something for curbside, although he has finally started ordering things online."
12866,my mom absolutely refused to do her Christmas shopping online.
12867,she had every excuse.
12868,"(itll take too long, itll be broken, theyll scam me, theyll steal my credit card info, its tradition, it's fine no one will be out) but we can't say shit."
12869,we can't call it out.
12870,we can't demand change.
12871,"if we want any hope of being a homeowner we rely on the inheritance, even college educated with a good job."
12872,they have more money.
12873,more voting power.
12874,but way less sense.
12875,it wouldn't be nearly as bad if they acknowledged how fucked things are and that they're the ones who perpetuated it.
12876,"like I had to move back home, i work in live events, i have to move back home because they fucked the real estate and housing market."
12877,so im stuck under their rules and their entitlement means no compromise.
12878,"im forced to be around it, theyre unsafe and disregard the pandemic."
12879,i cant do shit about it.
12880,I see their incompetence and i realize that in times of crisis theyre so selfish.
12881,the pandemic kind of highlighted a lot of people's true nature and reality is boomers are entitled as fuck despite having done nothing to warrant it.
12882,"i think that this is a real issue and the fire was there, but i also believe external forces see this and take advantage with propaganda."
12883,Covid is like 80% effective as a vaccine against covid in young people anyway.
12884,(Completely asymptotic)
12885,Loll I'm terrified of needles.
12886,And this is literally the first time ever I am super excited about getting stabbed.
12887,From Warwickshire as well...parents must have had a sense of humour!
12888,"It's holy ground, the virus wouldn't dare infect someone on holy ground."
12889,"I do have people in my life who are vulnerable to covid, but I also know people who have lost everything, who are depressed/suicidal, and who are suffering in many other ways."
12890,I also have old people in my life who would rather die with family than die alone hiding from covid or in a care home alone because family cannot visit.
12891,But this doesn’t make sense to you guys.
12892,Because you refuse to acknowledge that life itself is complex and nuanced and it’s value is not defined by the presence of a heartbeat.
12893,This kind of talk is too insensitive for you.
12894,Deaths should not be placed above other quantifiable and non quantifiable indicators of health.
12895,If people cannot take emotions out of policy making they should not be charged with such a task.
12896,I know the death toll pulls at your emotions but you need better solutions than lockdowns.
12897,Did you know every 10 seconds an American dies?
12898,This is not an important fact though.
12899,"It is not helpful for anything but fear mongering, it doesn’t tell us who died or why they died or how they died."
12900,Nobody wants to acknowledge that your chance of dying from covid if you are a healthy person below 60 is virtually 0%.
12901,Why should those people have the same restrictions as people over 75 when their risk of death is 1000x lower?
12902,We know a lot more about treating Covid now and we’re better at preventing things like pulmonary embolisms that might leave lasting health effects.
12903,We also have better treatment plans e.g.
12904,"Dexamethasone, Anticoagulants, and better strategies for administering oxygen that have reduced morbidity and mortality."
12905,We also had 9 months to bolster our health care capacity to deal with an influx of covid patients in the second wave so we wouldn’t need to shut down other health services.
12906,The number of infections and deaths on its own is meaningless.
12907,We need to know who is getting infected and who is dying.
12908,It’s a lot different if 10000 college kids get COVID and 10000 people in care homes get it.
12909,"We need to talk about who is dying, why they are dying and how can we protect them."
12910,The burden to our health care system will be vastly different.
12911,"Death is also not a good metric because health and well being is characterized by many non quantifiable and subjective factors, such as misery, suffering, depression etc."
12912,"How many lives are ruined by things like bankruptcy, unemployment, depression/anxiety, substance abuse/overdose, etc... What is worse?"
12913,One family losing everything after their small business goes bankrupt from the shutdown or a 93 year old who has end stage lung cancer and dies of covid in a care home?
12914,So like I said saying things like “OMG 300k people died from CoVID” is not helpful or important.
12915,"What did he do to be second, pay with a pound of flesh?"
12916,Vaccines don't work 100% and they don't have to.
12917,"They rely on herd immunity, all you need is to vaccinate most of the population and slow down the infection to the point it halts

So no, you don't get vaccinated and dive into the virus pool called whitehouse."
12918,It is unnecessary risk for a person to take.
12919,Guinea Pigs
12920,I think that would just be Nuclear war!
12921,"Denier of Covid's seriousness, or an anti-masker, or an anti-vaxxer."

12937,/s
12938,They should keep a tally of the number of people getting vaccinated everyday
12939,Why is it safer to not go if they're already vaccinated?
12940,"&gt;How is a business supposed to divine the comings and going’s of their employees personal lives 

Let's not set that precedent, either."
12941,Yikes.
12942,They started their trials in the UK when the epidemic slowed down and [got their US trial running only in September](https://www.ox.ac.uk/news/2020-09-02-development-oxford-covid-19-vaccine-expands-us-phase-iii-clinical-trial).
12943,"Then they had a few pauses along the way from an ill participant in the UK and a death in the Brazil trial - both were ruled to be unrelated, at least the Brazil case turned out to be in the placebo arm."
12944,They don’t call is Misery for nothing.
12945,You sound like Leonard from the Big Bang theory but less empathetic.
12946,"Only in the US and UK, really."
12947,The rest of Europe will likely see another cycle throughout the coming year.
12948,AstraZeneca's issues mean a really slow start of the vaccine program.
12949,"

&gt;Instead the demand was that you wear face masks and you don’t have a job, and you can’t do anything."
12950,I have no idea what this is supposed to mean because it's incoherent gibberish.
12951,The rest is only slightly less incoherent.
12952,This is a global fucking pandemic and the worst public health crisis in a hundred years.
12953,"It's spread by respiratory aerosols, so face masks are not an either/or proposition."
12954,"I'm sorry you don't like it; I don't like it either

&gt;By not taking a risk mitigation approach like the article suggests should have been done, you have driven people away from complying at all."
12955,"I don't know what world you're living in, but risk mitigation is precisely the approach California has taken."
12956,"The lack of compliance has nothing to do with it, and I haven't driven anyone away from complying."
12957,Our kids have had no difficulty complying whatsoever.
12958,"They understand how COVID is transmitted, that masks and social distancing protect them as well as others."
12959,"We occasionally have to remind them to bring a mask or put one on, but we haven't had a single tantrum or argument from either of them."
12960,"Nearly 300,000 Americans are dead and millions more grieving, sick, hospitalized, and unemployed, all because of a president who has literally done worse than nothing, leaving state and local governments holding the bag."
12961,"Mybhey're 10 and 8, but people who are ""driven away"" from doing the absolute minimum are"
12962,"Hey um, maybe we should start off by vaccinating the living."
12963,For some reason I find India's numbers to be suspect.
12964,Someone's head has got to roll for this royal screw up.
12965,"There is no excuse for this, and the US ordered 300 million doses of the Oxford vaccine."
12966,This seems wonderful.
12967,I hope we can get something like this going in the US.

12984,No state is OK.
12985,Question thst I've been wondering about with vaccine news.
12986,I read somewhere that vaccination all Frontline Healthcare workers and all those above 65 eliminates 99% of covid mortality risks.
12987,"As we get closer and closer to reaching this goal (I'd imagine even something like late February is reasonable but that's not as important to the question), do we start seeing the end of restrictions or should we still expect masking and social distancing to be required/reccomended?"
12988,Honest to God I know I'll do it if I must but I can't see our societies containing to function another year like this.
12989,Or not
12990,"Is there another sub where posts about number of new cases, deaths etc are still allowed?"
12991,Does anyone know why the public moderator logs disappeared?

13052,It would be very easy for injuries or deaths from vaccine issues to be misattributed to other medical problems.

13072,"I think there is another level of problems, which are hidden in what Panther is saying and it is the actions of goverment."
13073,"Goverment deny any compensation to businesses which were closed by goverment actions, which they should by law and there was a [judgement](https://ct24.ceskatelevize.cz/domaci/3082433-ctyri-opatreni-proti-koronaviru-jsou-nezakonna-soud-je-zrusil) about it and multiple other things in spring."
13074,"So goverment is now bypassing the law by forcing state of emergency and all measures are given by ministry of health, which doesn't have that power and there are new trials about it ongoing again - but under current situation, goverment don't have to pay the business that are closed, because they are ""not"" closed by goverment actions."
13075,"The main problem is, that goverment doesn't fulfill it's ""promises""."
13076,"They were under pressure from everyone since spring, when they were changing some measures every week and situation was very unclear for business ... 

Now, two health ministers later, we have a [risk score table](https://onemocneni-aktualne.mzcr.cz/pes) (called PES - a dog), with multiple degrees of measures, which should tell people, how everything will be there next week and goverment is not changing anything, people can orientate in the measures and can plan the future - example restaurants can buy a beer because they know they will be opened next week ..."
13077,"But ... every week, there are changes, every level has own ""puppet"" tables specified for different sectors, and all those ""puppets"" are changing from week to week, as somebody wants."
13078,It is not stable.
13079,"The article is not mentioning that we are currently at level 3, but current numbers are worsening for few days so if goverment follows the rules set by PES, country should be on level 4 next week, closing businesses opened last week."
13080,But goverment doesn't want to close it a week before Christmas (because money are more important for them).
13081,"So they ignore the rule, that if 3 consecutive days we have worse numbers, PES level increases - instead, they picked some measures from level 4 and said, they are now valid until we say they are not and country level of dog stays on level 3 ... because Christmas/money ..."
13082,"So, we are basically back at spring, every week goverment issues new measurements and nobody can plan anything ..."
13083,Nothing changed.
13084,"Now hotels and restaurants association [is saying](https://twitter.com/CT24zive/status/1336016984446787584), if goverment will continue in changing of the measures, they will not open again."
13085,"I totally agree with you, that opening them is a risk, but the problem lies elsewhere - goverment didn't chose that way, money are more important for them."
13086,"They could chose full lockdown for few weeks (Israel way), but they said (and promised) it is too bad to close it (as they will have to pay) so we will slowly open economics as situation gets better ... Now we have partially opened but still closed some businesses - and I don't want to discuss if restaurants are bigger risk than small businesses, and I don't want to discuss if restaurants and small businesses are bigger risk than opened malls (opened whole time), there are other [trials](https://www.ceskenoviny.cz/zpravy/senatori-napadli-u-ustavniho-soudu-omezeni-pro-maloobchod/1961670) ongoing on that ... 

TL;DR: The situation in Czech Republic is still very unclear in which measures are currently working and they change very often."

13109,"lol this sub is all about eating ""fuck em, if they don't take it, that's on them"" when it comes to redneck conservatives, but for this they're like ""uhhhhh"" and it makes me laugh

Reddit really is a weird bubble"
13110,"Oh okay, it was probably just that then."
13111,Now that I think about it logically there's no way they would've given an unsafe vaccine to teenagers.
13112,Accepting an organ from a willing donor or one who had died naturally is perfectly acceptable.
13113,"In this case, a closer comparison would be a transplant from someone who had been killed for organ harvesting, which would be a violation of their human dignity."
13114,Correct.
13115,That's a seperate category (hence the comma).
13116,But we know that is both a privilege (being home to help out) and a skill.
13117,One fun thing about Canada is that we don’t have a big issue with people worrying about going bankrupt alongside being really sick.
13118,We also discourage the idea that a person deserves better care just because of the money they make.
13119,Healthcare is a human right.
13120,The us has bought doses of the vaccine and won’t ship them to other countries until Americans are vaccinated
13121,Downvoted for posting true facts.
13122,Unreal.
13123,"Fact: 52,000+ dead in NY/NJ as of December 8, 2020."
13124,"That is 184 deaths per 100,000 population."
13125,"New Jersey: 195 per 100,000 people  
Population: 8.9 million residents

New York: 178  
Population: 19.4 million 

Runners up are:

Belgium: 173 per 100,000 population   
Peru: 111 per 100,000 population   
Italy: 100 per 100,000 population"
13126,I hear you.
13127,I think it's because they have many of those contracts with many nations.
13128,The contracts don't represent r&amp;d development funding.
13129,They represent orders.
13130,It's two very different things.
13131,Moderna accepted operation warp speed money.
13132,Biontech accepted development money from Germany and the EU.
13133,That was all to help develop and ramp up production.
13134,Sometimes that pizza used to really hit the spot!
13135,"A big pro to the J and J vaccine vs the current rna vaccines, is that it doesn't have to be kept at super cold temperatures."
13136,Makes distribution much more practical in many countries.
13137,One dose is a pretty big advantage too.
13138,"Yes, obviously."
13139,Countries locked down and then locked down again because in both cases the spread of the virus got out of control.
13140,Tegnell and Sweden in general thought they had made it through to 'herd immunity' and there was a lot of bragging here for months on end about how Sweden wasn't going to get another spike.
13141,"Not only were those people wrong, Sweden has now had to put in restrictions because of uncontrolled spread of the virus."
13142,"So all the herd immunity bullshit we heard over the past 9 months about Sweden all turned to be exactly that, bullshit."
13143,It's a bittersweet thing to know you were right all along on something like this because obviously people are now suffering as a result but this was very predictable.
13144,Can you take 2 different vaccine brands.
13145,i.e get Pfizer vaccine as 1st dose but by the time 2nd dose is taking only moderna vaccine available
13146,I’m not entirely sure of claims any actual dangers from back then.
13147,But I do know my PCP explained that much of the controversy was due to adults being preoccupied that they were giving this vaccine to preteens with the pretext that the vaccine helps again HPV which is sexually transmitted.
13148,The “not my kid” perspective of sexuality and adolescence.
13149,My parents never specifically bought into that - but it was a “it’s so new I’m not sure”.

13165,If that's the case teachers would never have to review things and regression wouldnt be a thing.
13166,That’s your opinion.
13167,"Mine is that safety of something that has already been rushed through the vetting process, that’s about to be distributed to the public on a massive scale, the safety of that should be prioritized."

13169,"You do understand they like to check out this brand née vaccine, maybe spot check the research and such."
13170,Little bit of caution is not a bad thing.

13176,Well let me talk from my experience of canceling and rescheduling a very large wedding and changing it to a small event.
13177,&gt; Its not as simple as “having a smaller wedding” or “just fucking waiting”because youre out thousands and thousands of dollars.
13178,You're wrong.
13179,My wife and I started planning our wedding in July of 2019 for a June 2020 wedding.
13180,"We had to cancel the June, 250 person wedding this year."
13181,I think in all we were out 3 thousand and have a credit with the local cupcake shop.
13182,"We rescheduled the wedding to be 25 people, outdoors, with a short ceremony."
13183,&gt;how much absolutely non-refundable money is being tossed down the drain if they don’t.
13184,"Only 2 people were Non-refundable, every other contract was refunded."
13185,"Correct that there is no tissue in the actual vaccine, but the point is to go with the non-HEK derived vaccines to discourage their continued usage."
13186,"🤦‍♀️my language was ambiguous

13190,"💯💯💯

I'm glad my school district leaders trust scientific reasoning and have kept school virtual."
13191,Case numbers have only continued to drastically increase in my area.
13192,"Some schools are doing sanitation theater to go hybrid or in person, but more and more schools are now being forced to virtual because they have hundreds of sick or exposed staff and students."
13193,(staff impacts are more likely to result in closure...

As a teacher I know there are many students actually learning."
13195,"I'm not on pace with where I'm ""supposed"" to be with content (I think that's stupid anyway 🤷🏻‍♀️) but most kids are getting there."
13196,Is it ideal?
13197,No.
13198,But until the spread is actually controlled I'm thankful to be at home.
13199,"Unsurprisingly to me, my kids who are struggling this year are the same kids who struggled in person last year...

Lots of these keyboard warriors want me to be fully in person teaching and will just blame me if I get sick from covid because I'm fat and I have asthma (I also run and work out but who cares right?)."
13200,"Sorry not sorry, I deserve to live."

13209,"It is entirely plausible to imagine that one of the many vaccines being created may pass a trial due to political pressure, corruption, whatever."
13210,Especially if they're the more high risk groups who were more likely to get hospitalized or die!
13211,I don't disagree with you.

13254,I’m 28 and was otherwise considered “healthy” before covid.

13257,"It's also true though, let's not pretend otherwise."
13258,It’s like sticking a plaster on an amputated limb.
13259,Immunity doesn’t last and the vaccine doesn’t stop you spreading it if you get other strains.
13260,Herd immunity for this 99% survival rate ‘pandemic’ is the only way in the end.
13261,"Conversation got way off track here, all I really wanted to comment on was the fact that they did receive government support in some form which makes that comment by Pfizer seem disingenuous to me."

13269,"The UK took a lot of heat for getting it out first, and it doesn't even have a large antivax movement."
13270,If the US had hyper-prioritized it the same way it would have frenzied the antivax movement and hurt the vaccination effort's credibility.
13271,"They can only track who has been where, not how they got infected."
13272,My guess is that the kind of people who travel right now are significantly more likely to have gotten infected because they take other risks as well.
13273,The best news all year.
13274,👌🏻
13275,Bruh take a break and go get some fresh air.
13276,"They are under no obligation to do anything and it's a nice gesture, even if done primarily for PR reasons."

13284,"Many vaccines require multiple doses or ""booster shots""."

13298,That's too much.

13303,Exactly!
13304,Double down for downtown!
13305,What can I get for about tree fitty
13306,Only thing we don't know is any long term side effects.
13307,Hence why vaccines usually take 4-6 years.
13308,It's true that it's more effective when everyone wears a mask since sick ones won't be spraying particles everywhere.
13309,"However, masks still help us a decent percentage even if they're not N95s."
13310,There is still some filtration for the wearer.
13311,It's kind of like going out into the winter cold.
13312,"Sure, if you don't have a nice winter jacket you're going to risk being cold."
13313,But that doesn't mean go outside naked.
13314,Throw on your hoodie and you'll still be better off than without.
13315,20% of the country has already had it.
13316,Lots of those people are the type that aren't going to take precautions or vaccines anyway.
13317,Moderna and Pfizer did not use them.
13318,"Yeah especially if it's Liam, the little shit"
13319,Why are you mixing up fiscal and monetary policy?
13320,Getting a vaccine ready so fast has to be up there with some of the most impressive scientific accomplishments in history.
13321,Maybe if climate change starts affecting the bottom line of first world countries they’ll be fucked to do something equally impressive about it.
13322,&gt;I was binge drinking long before lockdown.
13323,"Same, and now I justify it as, ""supporting local""."
13324,Or double sales?
13325,I do believe the contracts to purchase the vaccine from pfizer contained the stipulation that they needed to be approved.
13326,"So if they don't work, no money."
13327,That doesn't help the company with any of it's risks.
13328,They had to fork up the money to pay for the trials and the expansion of their manufacturing first.
13329,If the vaccine didn't work they would have been left with those expenses and money wasted.
13330,That is what the ceo is referring to.
13331,Good luck to you too.
13332,It's frustrating and disappointing.
13333,"Then when I found out about PUA I thought, well at least that will ease the bleeding for a little while."
13334,But at this point I don't ever expect to see that money.
13335,"To be honest, I expect to be denied for some obscure reason with no avenue to contest it."
13336,"I don't mean to be cynical and down, but it's hard to be positive any more."
13337,Doomscrolling?
13338,News flash: most of the people going
13339,"Because the US is pathetic, and so are you"
13340,Just because people seem happy doesn’t work!
13341,Why ?
13342,Don't they want to be able to organize the Olympics ?
13343,[removed]
13344,That’s terrible.
13345,They refuse to let us WFH because we are union.
13346,Everyone that is not union gets to WFH.
13347,We are getting infected everyday and they won’t let us go home until we get a positive.
13348,"Then when we do get a positive, we’re allowed back as soon as your fever isn’t 100 degrees."
13349,It’s so stupid
13350,Wasn't there some huge scandal about that one too?
13351,I got it when I was like in eighth grade but I seem to remember reading that it was actually dangerous sometimes.
13352,Or was that just anti-vax bullshit?
13353,"I will say, it's the worst vaccine I've ever gotten."
13354,My arm felt like it was radiating waves of pain from the injection point.
13355,Not fun.
13356,It's because the Oxford vaccine is way cheaper and easier to transport.
13357,To the end consumer (patient?)
13358,It doesn't matter because the government is paying for it but it does matter to the government.
13359,"Also the Oxford vaccine can be stored in a normal fridge,so  doesn't need an ultra low temp freezer, this will make transport and distribution considerably easier."
13360,For long term protection.

Can you direct me somewhere where I can learn more about this?"
13369,I keep hearing about this but still don't understand how this works.
13370,Thanks!
13371,To call it a non issue is going too far in the other direction.
13372,"From what I've read this was likely more of a measured gamble than anything else - in June it was about getting as many different possible vaccine candidates moving as was feasible, and it's not like Pfizer received zero support from the current administration."
13373,"There's plenty to complain about with the fed's handling of this crisis, this one is a *tad* overblown(though I do wanna reiterate, not a non issue)."

13380,why do you want covid to be bad forever
13381,...Meaning that we actually *do* need to all draw our own lines.
13382,I agree with you on that
13383,Ah Okay.
13384,I thought we'd be looking at 8 months to a year for the first dose.
13385,Then yeah we don't have much choice.
13386,I think it's a great idea.

13426,"These vaccines will have side effects, but after tens of thousands of volunteers, none of the side effects were deal killers."
13427,But what about people filling up Covid wards -- and cemeteries?
13428,The vaccine will prevent that.
13429,"1M people getting vaccinated can prevent something like 5,000 eventual Covid deaths or 25,000 eventual Covid hospitalizations, or 50-100,000 people with long term health issues like lung lesions, blood clots, extreme fatigue, loss of smell and taste."
13430,The tradeoff is that a good number of the 1M vaccinated people will feel bad with aches for 24-48 hrs after getting the shots.

13454,Awesome username Mang.
13455,I'm still happier with him in place and people dying than I would be with more bureaucracy.
13456,Achy and fatigued enough that it's recommended to take the vaccine before a day off work or to take a sick day.
13457,"The immune response itself even absent the virus is unpleasant, but unlike the virus is short (hours to a day or two)."
13458,bro at that point you just have to stop giving a shit.
13459,like vaccines will be actively entering people's arms and your worrying about what people's attitudes will be like lol

13471,Good idea with the truck stop.
13472,Unfortunately I am one that gets sleepy when driving so past the 8 hour mark is when I need the break.
13473,"Im not necessarily concerning with ""dying"", rather Im a bit concerned with the long term side effects

All other vaccines require and have required long term studies to see what the side effects are because side effects do and have happened 

This vaccine will not be tested for long term side effects."
13474,Does this sound a little unsettling to you?
13475,"Im not saying the vaccine will kill, im saying, I dont want to take the risk of being the first people to get it."
13476,"They will literally be the test subjects for long term effects if any

You know the late night Lawyer TV commercials that say ""have you ever taken (PUT FDA APPROVED MEDS HERE) and suffered major side effects."
13477,"A class action lawsuit has been filed and you can qualify, call now""

See the problem is that all these drugs that later turn out to be bad, were once called SAFE and tested, but in the end they were not, and that bothers me"
13478,It means that it will take longer for restrictions to be rolled back because there are still too many people out there who will be capable of spreading the virus.

13483,I never said not to vaccinate them first.
13484,"I'm saying with them being vaccinated first, that won't really decrease the infection rates and case numbers because most healthcare workers aren't getting sick to begin with."
13485,"It will protect them, but it won't skew the hospitalization or death statistics too much."
13486,So people need to still be very careful for a few more months.
13487,blame your law makers and elected officials.
13488,this is why the antimask and reopen early campaigns were so strongly aligned with Republican ideals.
13489,"it affected race, income level, and communities disproportionately."
13490,Nobody is saying that from what I'm reading.
13491,He only said that the numbers probably won't be as drastically affected as we hope until we get past the healthcare workers and move further into vaccinating the high risk populations.

13496,Also the pandemic is causing issues that are much more complicated than what kids are learning in school.
13497,My other daughter's district has been virtual since school started this year and it's been predictable.
13498,"That is comforting to her, and she appreciates knowing she, her family, her teachers, and support staff are not making one another sick."
13499,"She also appreciates knowing if her diabetic father gets covid, it's not because of her."

The first is that the drug companies are not starting 100% “from scratch”."
13521,They are already in the vaccines business and springboard off of that knowledge continuously.
13522,The second is somewhat related: these companies have to make a brand new batch of flu virus vaccine every year due to the nature of its mutations etc.
13523,so this is more like an evolution in the process and not a revolution.
13524,"If the inmate was diagnosed with Covid, would his execution be delayed while he was treated for it?"

13623,The UK plans to vaccinate groups that represent 90 to 99% of preventable death.
13624,"Let's say the Pfizer / Moderna vaccines prevent death in 95% of the cases (it might be higher since it avoids any kind of symptoms in 95% of the cases), that would mean a reduction of between 85,5% and 94,5%."
13625,"COVID's IFR right now is estimated to be at 2,3%, but seroprevalence studies show it could  around or less than 1%."
13626,"If the COVID vaccine prevents 90% of deaths we could be talking about an infection fatality rate as low as 0,04% and as high as 0,23% which would put it pretty close to the flu's IFR."
13627,"Since we know asymptomatic infection rate is significantly than that of presymptomatic and asymptomatic cases, a good amount of infections will be reduced too, especially when the vaccine is given to people between 50 and 60."
13628,"Also, treatment for COVID will improve since the volume of hospitalized people and especially ICU patients will be reduced dramatically."
13629,"Countries will be able to avoid a big percentage of that 0,04-0,23% of  infected people who dill die from COVID with a mix of new, different treatments that will be available as we won't need as many dose: I'm talking mostly about Regeneron and Remdesivir."
13630,"Also a lot more people will be able to donate plasma as way more people will be infected, and that would work as a treatment for the really small amount of the population in danger of dying from COVID."
13631,"TL;DR We can go back to pretty normal even if half of the supposed thresold for herd immunity (60-70%) get vaccinated strategically, because the reason we're in a lockdown is not because there's a virus infecting us, but rather how many people die and get hospitalized because of the virus."

13698,"That is unlikely to happen as a direct result of the mRNA after any significant period of time; as she points out, and as we know from decades of mRNA research, mRNA is rapidly degraded and cleared and poses little risk of having some sort of side effect ""pop up"" later on."
13699,That's actually one of the things that makes mRNA research slightly difficult -- it's so unstable that it just doesn't last long at physiological conditions.
13700,"In short, the mRNA itself is *overwhelmingly* unlikely to cause issues that don't show up immediately."
13701,"So then the second question is on delayed issues that occur because of the body's reaction to the mRNA; essentially, we're thinking about autoimmune reactions here."
13702,"As we wrote above, the vast majority of those cases will present within weeks of immunization, if they occur at all; the likelihood that we see an unforeseen autoimmune reaction in any significant numbers long after the vaccine is given out is very small."
13703,"It's also worth remembering that these mRNA molecules encode for a protein *already encoded by SARS-CoV-2*, and to date, we haven't seen a massive rise in autoimmune reactions from that virus beyond that which we would expect for a widespread viral infection."
13704,"But if this vaccine causes a widespread problem in the future (which, again, is very unlikely), it would be reasonable to suspect this hypothetical adverse event would occur from natural infection as well."
13705,"Basically, the delivery system may be (relatively) new (although it's been used before in investigational drugs and has decades of research, as noted in the post body), but the underlying biology of adverse effects is pretty similar to that of other vaccines."
13706,Hope that helps!

13708,I'll prefer Sputnik V vaccine.
13709,Appears to be slightly more effective and uses human adenoviruses instead of a chimpanzee adenovirus.
13710,"Yeah, this is clearly misinformation."
13711,Also probably more likely to be robbed in a Walmart lot.
13712,I think you forget Obama's Presidency.
13713,"One of the reasons he wasn't able to get more done is that the GOP obstructed him... at the end he could only do things via executive orders, which could easily be undone by Trump."

13732,How guaranteed is it that the second dose will make the human body immune to COVID-19?
13733,We've yet to even  see the death toll from Thanksgiving.
13734,"The recent spike in cases and deaths could be attributed to both the weather change and Halloween, which is a small holiday in comparison to Thanksgiving, where I personally know of at least 2 different families having large gatherings."
13735,It's the calm before the holiday storm.
13736,&gt; Nobody should expect the vaccine to significantly change their lives before next Summer.
13737,"I live in a city that has handled COVID well and even then, we have a 10 PM curfew, outdoor dining and barbers are now closed, and I'm not allowed to see people outside my household, even if it's outdoors, socially distant, with masks."
13738,"By March, we should have enough vaccines that those measures are not necessary."
13739,"Masks still required, no indoor dining of course, but that's a huge difference in my life."
13740,&gt; Yeah if SICK.
13741,But I’m not wearing it all the time for the entire winter which is November-April/May where I live.
13742,"Yes, because COVID is *unique* in that you can spread virus for days and days before you feel symptomatic, if you feel symptomatic at all."
13743,"That appears to not be the case with virtually any other respiratory virus, which is why this whole ""universal masking"" thing is so important for COVID *specifically*."
13744,You didn’t.
13745,I’m just affirming that you mean they should be a recommendation right?
13746,Not a mandate?
13747,Is that CVS's problem?
13748,Shouldn't the government be sending the vaccines to where it's needed first?
13749,Send to hospitals and nursing homes.
13750,Send to doctors' offices who can get it to at-risk people next.
13751,By the time it gets to a corner store like CVS it should have already reached those who need it most.
13752,"If you are currently needing assistance of any kind, an economic reset is what you specifically need."
13753,Vitamin DMT?
13754,One of your actual heroes.
13755,Isn't that mostly because the vaccine hasn't been tested on those groups yet?
13756,"Children weren't included in the trial, and I would be shocked if the initial trial allowed pregnant or immunocompromised individuals."
13757,"So yes, there's no data on safety yet."
13758,"But that's because there hasn't been a chance to have data on safety yet, not because the vaccine is unsafe (there's been nothing to indicate that it would be particularly unsafe in other groups -- but they always are extra-careful with kids and pregnancies and already-sick people)."
13759,I googled what you said to google and it showed that flu cases are clearly down this year compared to last year.
13760,Yeah but I'm 30.
13761,Realistically speaking I have a .001 chance of dying because I'm in good health with no medical conditions.
13762,I'm more at risk of wrecking my car and dying every single day.
13763,I just can't afford to sit in my house anymore.
13764,Literally.

13766,"Then I would be way more careful but at this point, I can't afford to not take food when I'm offered it."

13769,Entire country goes into delirium tremens at once.
13770,We play jackbox games
13771,If no one dies from the virus even if they're infectious the spread becomes relatively irrelevant.
13772,&gt; My mother is one of them.
13773,A simple cold can have her bed ridden for 6-8 weeks.
13774,These fucks don't give to shits about your mother.
13775,That's the problem.
13776,More extensive testing would reveal it.
13777,"I suppose that's fallen by the wayside though in the rush to market, even though there are other ways to vaccinate such as traditional inactivated virus and adenovirus vector."
13778,The article above says 1-2 Americans dying every minute.
13779,And Cuban is crying about his 100mill
13780,"The problem is, there will be vaccination requirements for activities and travel (to see family, for example)."
13781,So healthy 28 year olds could be stuck inside for another year and we can expect problems in work or school environment where unvaccinated people will get shunned.

13801,I know 2 others that got tested because they became ill and came back positive.
13802,"The point is, if 33% of people who get sick get long covid, then its more like 15% that get lingering symptoms, when you factor in the ones that never develop illness."

13831,No fucking thank you.
13832,&gt;This WHOLE THING was justified on the basis of overwhelmed hospitals.
13833,"And that means that the initial justification is the only one that can be used, ever, even when we have new data?"

13939,I haven't read that anyone giving the mRNA vaccines is doing any kind of risk assessment.

13952,"Just an FYI, the US probably wont be giving this EUA until atleast the end of January, Oxford is running a full half dose trial in the US so that way they can apply for EUA around the same times J&amp;J applies."

14301,If you have data then please post it.
14302,All this has done is reinforce my belief that there are pretty much no good guys in our government.
14303,"There are those who say the wrong thing + do the wrong thing, and those who say the right thing + go do the wrong thing anyway."
14304,There are maybe four or five elected officials in the whole stinking country who are walking the talk.
14305,Is Russia still giving out the Sputnik vaccine?
14306,Is there any evidence yet that it even works?
14307,Russians are rightfully wary of the “russia-approved” vaccine.
14308,Add this to it and it’s unlikely many will get it at all.

14312,"&gt;I really like how your claim that covid might cause everything in the future, from Parkinson to infertility, doesn't come with a simple number or estimation of how ma y people are possibly affected."
14313,You are very welcome.
14314,I try to keep my discussions topical to the disease rather than to politics surrounding the disease.
14315,&gt;Talking about long term effects of a virus but the lockdowns long term effects can't be factored in.
14316,"Personally, I think that the long term effects of the lock down have Ben talked about ad nauseum  And, considering that lock Downs are targeted and not a blanket across the United States or even around communities, I think that we should see them as a limited and targeted  Approach."

14328,And the completely useless Trump administration didn't seal the deal to get more vaccines from Pfizer so they made that deal with other countries.
14329,Now our economy and national health will be stalled from recovery for 4-6 more months because of Trumps foolishness.
14330,Great job Trump!
14331,Way to keep America great!

I thought republicans wanted to ""get the economy moving again""."
14333,Then why didn't they make this deal?
14334,Let me guess.
14335,They wanted a talking point for the next democratic president to look like they failed the US even though it was Trump and republicans again fucking us over then blaming the other guy.
14336,Christ this shit is tiring to watch play out over and over and rural dip shits still can't see past it after 40+ years of this crap.

14340,Could you please provide a source?
14341,I'm curious where you're seeing that flu cases are higher than usual since every source I can find says the opposite.
14342,We have a verification process for specialists.
14343,You’ll see them with flairs like mine.
14344,Which ones are getting EUA this week?
14345,Which ones will be available for mass distribution by Q2?
14346,Seems stupid to turn down early and sustained access to a vaccine to save a few billion bucks in the middle of a crippling pandemic.
14347,"As someone who has a degree in computer network systems engineering and cybersecurity, I have come to realize from actions over the last four years is that if you want to save humanity from itself, then turn of the internet."
14348,The average moron has no use for it.
14349,Right but children very rarely even display symptoms much less get sick or severely sick from this virus.
14350,They aren’t believed to contribute to much spread either.
14351,And I know Pfizer and Oxford I believe included children as young as 12 in their trials.
14352,Do you have a source for this?
14353,I’ve been trying to unravel the whole Oxford thing!

14357,&gt;the vaccine wouldn’t be an immediate fix to return to pre Covid normalcy.
14358,They mean we need to wait until a substantial proportion of the population is vaccinated.
14359,"Once young people are offered the shot, it's over."
14360,Back to normal.
14361,thank you for explaining that...did the people that got the virus get as sick as someone who didn't have the vaccine?
14362,Or is that not how it works?
14363,The executive order on is another stain on the Presidency.

14388,I hate Trump and think he should rot in prison for how he's screwed over this country with regard to this pandemic.

14390,"According to Dr. Scott Gottlieb, board member of Pfizer and the source of this article's claim, he believes:

&gt;the U.S. government likely turned down Pfizer’s offer because it wanted to make sure it diversified the number of companies it agreed to purchase option agreements with."

14398,What don’t you understand that approval from other countries means next to nothing here?
14399,Fuck em.
14400,Let every one of those stupid bastards get covid and kill each other if they want.

14403,"Honestly, I don't mind wearing a mask."
14404,Just doesn't bother me.
14405,My family and I would probably catch fewer colds if we wore masks more frequently than the pre-Covid-never.
14406,"If I could literally never get a common cold again, that'd be great lol."

14420,*
14421,Any idea like this sounds good on paper.
14422,But considering how far back a lot of our infrastructure is when dealing with data on a federal level...
14423,I doubt things like this could happen.
14424,And the alternative is having the virus wreak havoc on your country.
14425,Unfortunate you have to deal with a pandemic and the restrictions but it’s what needs to be done.
14426,[removed]
14427,Come on down to the midwest!
14428,We closed our restaurants for maybe two months and then opened them right back up again.
14429,Yep that’s kind of what I was thinking.
14430,I was really surprised to learn this myself about the vaccine and immunocompromised and I’ve been keeping up with COVID since the early days.
14431,"I have definitely been concerned by seeing people saying that they were going to take masks off, even if public health officials instruct folks to continue using them."
14432,Seems like it could hurt the vulnerable.
14433,*chews vaccines*
14434,that's what she said.
14435,I only say probably based off the title OP used.
14436,"The best goalpost move of all time ""Mask are worthless and don't do anything"" two weeks later ""We lied, we wanted to make sure all the healthcare workers got mask first lmao"""
14437,Vaccine effectiveness is measured by ratio.
14438,"In the Moderna vaccinated group, 11 people out of 15,000 got the virus (by Moderna's definition of what ""got the virus means"") for an overall infection rate of 0.07%."
14439,"(There's disagreement about whether the drug company's ""got the virus"" measurements are well chosen; see the Forbes article ""Covid-19 Vaccine Protocols Reveal That Trials Are Designed To Succeed."")"
14440,"In the Moderna placebo group, 185 people of 15,000 got the virus, for an overall infection rate of 1.23%."
14441,"If you divide 0.07% by 1.23%, you get a 5.7% infection rate — or inversely, a 94% protection rate, which is what's claimed."
14442,"The USA is approaching 300,000 deaths."
14443,"The quote ""a million deaths is a statistic"" and then he said we only have 700,000 more to reach a million deaths in the USA."
14444,Vaccines are generally not very profitable for biotech as a whole so yeah
14445,these vaccines are so efficacious that I'll be getting inoculated with them ASAP.
14446,Can't wait.
14447,Start vaccinating and get our lives back for spring/summer 2021
14448,Still not taking it.
14449,True.
14450,There are so many factors to consider when forging ones outlook on what’s happening.
14451,I keep losing pieces of info like this.
14452,So you’d rather trust random people on Reddit than simply Google a scientific source?
14453,Did you ever learn how to research facts in school?
14454,"There's a lot of scrutiny on them for this, so I doubt they'd screw it up."
14455,They might not be as thorough for anti itch cream #576 though...
14456,The longest receipt comment was pretty funny.
14457,"Once my friends and family are vaccinated, we’re going to party!"
14458,"I’ve been soooo careful for so long, but once the risk of severe illness drops, it’s time to kick it with the fam."
14459,I can’t wait!
14460,I might still do masks in public just because I don’t mind them and why not get some protection from other respiratory illnesses.
14461,It’s been nice not having a cold for most of the year.
14462,Which of the three vaccines would get right now if you could get one?
14463,"What's so striking is how many people are willing to play along knowing the truth, stoking the rage of the uninformed."
14464,2020 is really fucking frightening.
14465,It's not really shocking when you find out plenty of them don't believe in covid.
14466,They think it's a white conspiracy to control them.
14467,"Yeah, this week we had 17 workers test positive."
14468,It’s crazy they still haven’t changed our policies since September even tho clearly the roll out back to the office isn’t working.

14470,There is a rumor osu will play IU again this weekend if Purdue has to pull out of their game
14471,"From the interim data, there were 17 asymptomatic cases in the control group vs 7 in the vaccine one for the LD/SD dosage, so it seems that there could be a strong reduction in the contagiousness too."
14472,No similar effect in the SD/SD group though.
14473,De stigmatized?
14474,Fine.
14475,Mandate?
14476,No.
14477,"i guess he chose to be, seeing as he got the vaccine"
14478,That’s good information to know!
14479,And thank you!
14480,Keeping my fingers crossed that one of the vaccines end up being safe for the immunocompromised!
14481,Sorry once I've gotten a 90+ percent effective vaccine  and I've waited the appropriate amount of time for its full protection I'm getting my life back.
14482,Yeah this only inoculates three people sooo
14483,It’s not binary.
14484,There is a whole spectrum between “no symptoms at all” and “death”
14485,The tens of thousands additional people who will die probably would have preferred the UK's method.
14486,"If the FDA was going to go over the data, why did they wait until the report was finished rather than starting the day the data was provided to the company?"
14487,None of this survives the slightest scrutiny.
14488,Is there a good reason to mass produce this vaccine in addition to the other two given the significant drop in efficacy?
14489,Will mass producing this one allow us to mass produce much more overall or just drain resources that could have gone into mass producing the other ones?
14490,Let people be responsible for  themselves.

14492,Naw.
14493,He probably to poor and just sleeps behind the hospital.
14494,Restaurants would stay closed until at least mid-January.
14495,The only things that would re-open on Dec. 15 are basically museums and theaters with masks and social distancing measures still in place.
14496,All stores are currently open as of now in France.
14497,61% like of people who have or have had covid?
14498,Damn... I’ve been watching daily case number but haven’t really paid attention to total coverage.
14499,"I think it’s currently unclear (always happy to take in new info) as to if you actually have an immunity to covid post infection, how long that lasts, and if covid will mutate."
14500,"I’ve heard things in passing about some mutations already being found, I think..."
14501,"The only way to move past this, I think, would be to completely have a significant (80-90%?)"
14502,vaccinated at once.
14503,Which will never happen.
14504,"Hopefully, as we go into the year, we can take advantage of these vaccines to get back to our daily lives, IMO somewhere in the May-June range."
14505,"Many governments, including the US, suppressed news about the virus because they felt it could sabotage the war effort."
14506,"People were far less connected over long distances then, though more connected within their communities."
14507,I think that's one thing you probably can't change.
14508,"Unblinding data on who received a placebo versus the real thing, e.g."
14509,"on a case-by-case basis as they become infected, runs the risk of early data leaking, and may also give a false impression."
14510,"For example, even with 90% effectiveness, there's still pretty good odds that the very first person infected would be in the vaccine group, and if that information got out, the trial would be ruined as everybody in the trial would lose confidence and go into hiding believing that they weren't protected."
14511,So you still have to wait until some predetermined number of cases occur before you unblind anything.
14512,"What you probably can do is evaluate the demographics of the trial as a whole, e.g."
14513,"make sure they include enough black, white, and asian people, and you could make sure that they aren't selecting a bunch of homebodies that are never going to go out and get exposed to the virus."
14514,Safety data is another easy one to evaluate while the trial is ongoing.
14515,"Obviously, anyone who has a severe medical reaction is going to be unblinded immediately because that could be relevant to how you treat them."
14516,"And even if for some reason you didn't unblind everyone with a severe medical event, you can tell pretty early on if the study group as a whole suddenly develops a 10% increase in stroke occurrences compared to the general population."
14517,I have a few neighbors who don’t wear masks.
14518,Most do but they don’t.
14519,It’s like...you’re willing to risk all the long term dammage to be a tough guy?
14520,That’s gonna be a sweet oxygen tank your hauling around at 42 my dude.
14521,I was just eating raw cookie dough.

14526,"We believe facemask mandate would make people believe it is fine as long as you use a mask, which would make people less cautious."
14527,"It sounds like covid, if you had it, exacerbated your underlying issues."
14528,The scary thing comes from what May already be lurking just as much as the virus itself.
14529,Imagine a million people with a million different health issues like pancreatitis or untreated diabetes or any number of things.
14530,"Again, I still think it’s a little unclear if you had it and if having it is what caused your pancreatitis/pneumonia or the other way around or some other way."

14535,It's two weeks of drinking.
14536,"Yet sounds extremely hot, curious"
14537,What do you think about incentivizing getting the vaccine by giving those that choose to some sort of stimulus check?
14538,"Obviously, people who can't get the vaccine due to health reasons should receive it automatically, and there are other edge cases (dependents, etc), but how does that sound broadly speaking?"
14539,"Data says 62% in all ages in 20,000 participants."
14540,"90% in participants aged 18-55 only with the ""error"" dosage in 2000 participants."
14541,Combined is 70%.
14542,That is the data.
14543,And numbers do not remain solid.

14555,"""The vaccine"" is not a 24 hour event."
14556,It is a 365 day long process.
14557,And people will be selfish.
14558,And those who don't get the vaccine first should probably behave rationally - as if nothing has changed in the pandemic.
14559,But will they?

14580,figure it out and get vaccinated.
14581,COVID19 has a novel way of infecting (via a receptor called ACE2).
14582,It's likely this is unique to this virus due to this method of infection.
14583,ACE2 is found in many organs in the human body (including blood vessels).

14596,Not eating to keep yourself from catching covid is like not going to the hospital for a heart attack because of covid.
14597,You are making the correct choice to keep yourself alive.

14602,"So while we know death count of Covid, for many it is still just a number"
14603,"So China's successful mitigation through lockdowns stymied its tests on its own population, and our calamities helped the pharmaceutical companies?"
14604,Moderna made a better vaccine.
14605,It’s cheaper more effective and easier to transport.
14606,I don't think sharply reducing deaths (which should of course be the highest priority) == return to normal though.

14610,So all these posts blaring the government for not giving Pfizer money is because Pfizer would t take the money.

14630,Flu jab is performed at pharmacies.
14631,But it still doesn't answer the question.
14632,Lets say a new virus comes out in say 5 years.
14633,Let's say for some reason it's different and the current mRNA vaccines don't work.
14634,"Say they come out and say ""it's going to be 2 years before we have an effective vaccine""."
14635,Do we shut down for 2 years?
14636,"The media tries to pass this off as a once every 100 year type event, the idea being that we'll never see this again in our lifetimes."
14637,The reality is living in a globally connected society we're far more  likely to see these type of viruses again regularly.
14638,Do we shut down every time there's a new virus that is deadly?
14639,"5 actually, going by your list."
14640,I think the race is now to production and sales.
14641,"Nope, clearly didnt learn from 1918."
14642,"Although Pfeizer did say today that Trump did a hard pass on ordering more of the vaccine over the summer, and now the next batch available for the US to buy is June or July i think."

14649,It is at least somewhat related to school.
14650,My 9 year old has been battling depression since this summer.
14651,He is an only child in our home and has had limited in person interaction with other children.
14652,"School for him is not about the learning, he picks that up quick with almost no struggles."
14653,School for him is beneficial because of the enrichment and socialization it provide.
14654,He isn't getting that at home.
14655,"Yes he games with friends, but it's not the same."
14656,We don't live in a neighborhood with a bunch of kids out riding bikes and stuff.
14657,Almost all his friends are in immune compromised houses.
14658,Many children are suffering greatly mentally.
14659,My son has parents who love him and are trying our hardest to make sure he is ok. Not every kid has that.
14660,"Even if it was only in droplets and not airborne, how does that even make a difference?"
14661,It doesn't change the fact that you should wear a mask.
14662,Im sick of these dumbass cavemen finding every technicality as a reason to not wear a mask.
14663,So then the race is over right?
14664,Covid what ?
14665,"It would be awesome if this will actually happen, because it would mean that 100 years from now the world will be much, much more rational."

14667,"""Soon after, another account — NetworkinVegas.com, which says it is a ""source for finding out what's going on in Vegas"" — tweeted the photo of Keeperman as purported proof that the garage hospital was ""a scam."""

14688,yea!
14689,any student with medical conditions just die right off!
14690,quite effective!
14691,If the vaccine was late they still get the $2B.
14692,As long as they produce an approved vaccine they get it.
14693,That's the spirit mate 👏 .
14694,[removed]
14695,Increased case counts were inevitable going into the winter months when people spent more time indoors.
14696,"I don't know exactly who the ""people"" you're referring to are, but masks absolutely can and do help prevent transmission - ""help"" being the operative word here."
14697,"Masks reduce transmission on the order of 80% for health care workers, but more like 50% for non health care workers; the difference is in proper use and compliance rates."
14698,"San Francisco mask compliance is among the highest in the country: MUNI reports rider mask compliance of roughly 90%, which is very high but still leaves 10% without masks, in addition to those who wear them improperly (how many people have you seen with their masks under their noses?)."
14699,"San Francisco County also has the fourth lowest daily new case count, a 2.1% positivity rate (state average is 9.7%, LA/OC is 10%, Sutter County is 21.2%), 29% ICU capacity, and the lowest death rate of any major city in the country."
14700,"Masks alone aren't enough, though, and there is still significant resistance to both mask-wearing and other mitigation measures; protests against mask mandates and other mitigation measures are commonplace."
14701,Churches routinely defy restrictions on large gatherings and have gone to court - even all the way to the Supreme Court - absolutely determined to hold large indoor services with no mask requirements.
14702,"More immediately, the current surge in case numbers is directly attributable to Thanksgiving gatherings despite clear and unequivocal messaging that fall weather cases were already on the rise and that gathering with people from other households would drive transmission rates even higher, overwhelm hospitals and ICUs, exhaust already-depleted medical personnel and resources, increase deaths, and move counties into more restrictive tiers."
14703,"Exactly as predicted, case numbers began to increase exponentially the week after Thanksgiving, and the stay-at-home order was issued December 6."
14704,"Anti-mask and anti-curfew protests began before the order was even issued, and some restaurants in Southern California have remained open in protest."
14705,"Masks are critically important, but it will take more than masks."
14706,This is the worst pandemic in a hundred years; masks are one of the tools in the box.
14707,I don't see what's so hard to understand about that.
14708,Don't we have 3 or 4 with Oxford Pfizer Moderna Sino vac and Sputnik?
14709,Hey!
14710,Happy cake day!
14711,It's great that you're making so much progress!
14712,Congratulations.
14713,I hope you have a good support system to help you.
14714,"I'm not afraid of death, but the idea of having an experience like that.... That's my worst nightmare."
14715,They put up all initial cost.
14716,"If they'd failed, they would have got nothing."
14717,If their vaccine was late they would've got nothing.
14718,"If it were possible to quarantine people over 70 and those who are vulnerable and let the virus rip through the rest of society, obviously, that would be great (putting aside those healthy people who do die or who have long term health implications) BUT in a working society it’s just not possible."
14719,"Let’s assume this is done (shield the vulnerable and let the virus rip through the rest of society), I see the following issues: 

- staff are needed at care homes to look after those elderly people who live there."
14720,"If the virus is ripping through society but we are shielding our elderly in care homes then these staff members are highly likely to get infected at some point and given the virus can spread prior to positive tests or symptoms protecting the residents is not possible, unless all those care givers also quarantine along with their families."
14721,"- then you have people over 70 living at home, some of whom live by themselves or with their partner (ok so we could deliver to them etc) and others who live with other family members, so those other family members would have to quarantine as well."
14722,"- then there are those who are younger but still vulnerable (anyone who is obese, has diabetes, high blood pressure, autoimmune issues, and any other issues I’ve missed)."
14723,Add to that all their family members so the virus isn’t brought into the home.
14724,Including kids staying home from school.
14725,"- then you have people who may not know they have an underlying issue yet...

And this wouldn’t just be for a few weeks or months."
14726,It’s likely to be for a extended period of time while the virus runs its course or all of the above at risk people get vaccinated.
14727,"When you add up all the people over 70, anyone else who’s vulnerable, all the care givers of these people, and all the people living in the homes of anyone in these categories it’s very likely a much larger percentage of the population would need to quarantine (and not be able to do their job and contribute to a functioning society) than you think."
14728,"EU is mainly betting on Oxford's vaccine, Germany also kind of fumbled the ball with ordering a small amount of Pfizer/Moderna though."
14729,We had some positive cases at work and people started wearing masks all the time.
14730,Then our head guy sent out an email that masks aren't mandatory and everyone but me and one of my immediate coworkers (I have two immediate) are the only one wearing them.
14731,One other person I know only puts his mask on when more than three people are in the room.
14732,Luckily I spend most of my time in the office and I'm by the window which I can open with a little heater under my desk.
14733,At least I can tell I'm getting fresh air now that the high doesn't get above 40
14734,At its peak (so far) we are experiencing more deaths per day than the total deaths of 9/11.
14735,That’s per day.
14736,Yes this will be remembered.
14737,"It’s silly to compare this to 9/11 

9/11 changed how security was treated, especially at airports."
14738,"Yes, us middle aged (and especially older) cats do remember"
14739,La Crosse is pretty small.
14740,I didn’t even know they had a hospital.
14741,Been through that town many times.
14742,Small enough town that if a handful of hospital staff gets sick it would cause this problem.

14779,"The side effects are usually bigger if you already had the illness, because a vaccine is there to train your immune system to respond to an pathogen."
14780,"(Please do note this is about typical side effects like a small felling of sickness after a shot, exotic things like lasting side effects work a little bit different, then general immune response, and are just like that really really exotic)

If it already knows how to respond to it the chances of really feeling the shot are higher because your body goes instantly into high alert and starts the immune reaction."
14781,"This reaction is a big part what you feel of an illness, like fever e.g."
14782,"This immediate reaction is what protects you when you get the real illness, because then your immune system is in fighting shape, before the pathogen can get a foothold in your body."
14783,"If your immune system doesn't know the pathogen then it's going to take time to ""test"" strategies to fight the pathogen (eli5 explanation), which especially in vaccines usually means a less intense reaction."
14784,In case of a real illness this delayed response can also kill you.
14785,"The thing is that if you had the illness you can not say how well your immune system is currently responding, there have been cases of reinfection with covid19."
14786,So it's probably best to listen to official guidelines.

14804,"They provide a scatterplot of counties vaccination rates by it's rural/urban ""score""."

14806,"Yes, that is true and correct; but anyone looking at the graph can tell that straight line is not telling the real story."
14807,"The ""real"" relationship is definitely curved, not a straight line."

14900,I'm tired of hearing you parrot this article where the data used for the conclusion is a FB survey.
14901,Your NY/SC observations are not conclusive evidence.
14902,"Please stop saying, “survive.” People survived polio too but ended up in an iron lung for the rest of their lives."
14903,Covid survivors are having long term heart &amp; lung damage.
14904,There’s been lung transplants.
14905,Heart attacks &amp; strokes after surviving.
14906,Saying Covid is survivable is a bit disingenuous.

14916,I believe OP is correct.
14917,This is the governance equivalent of Dan Orlovsky running out the back of his own endzone....
14918,This whole thing was justified with the risk of overwhelmed hospitals.
14919,"Once the most vulnerable are vaccinated, that risk ends."
14920,We don't stay locked down and masked up because of some healthy hypochondriac 20-somethings.

14927,"Walking around in the cold can irritate your nose and make it runny, you can cough and wheeze after running if your asthmatic, you can get a headache from any multitude of things."
14928,I’m not wearing a mask for any of that shit.
14929,There’s an argument to be made to mask up if you’re definitely sick but that “remotely symptomatic” stuff is complete bullshit.
14930,Are ya winning son?
14931,U.S. - Yep
14932,The FDA is literally one of the most difficult organizations to get a product through in the world.
14933,You have to make sure your product is damn good.
14934,"I recently just found out that I know one person who was hospitalized and died, but she was 94, had several other comorbidities and had been completely bedridden for the last 3 years."
14935,Over the past year alone her children were advised to come and say their final goodbyes twice for other reasons before she actually passed.
14936,"Any death is certainly sad, but this particular case doesn't exactly scare me."
14937,The other people I know who were diagnosed had very mild symptoms or were completely asymptomatic.
14938,"That's *highly* dependent on the amount of vaccines that we get access to, and AFAIK we have no idea how long the immunity actually lasts."
14939,Let's not get too optimistic about this just yet.
14940,This does pretty much absolutely nothing to change the spread.
14941,"Most of the ""red"" communities were already back at Phase 3 Step 1 with no change in spread."
14942,I don't really expect anything or feel one way or another other about an individual situation.
14943,My point is overall despite public health advice we have all been drawing our own lines and it doesn't work.
14944,Some peoples line was wearing a mask in the first place.
14945,Some peoples line was giving up going to bars.
14946,Some peoples line is not seeing family.
14947,"Public health officials telling us not to do something or to follow guidelines doesn't invalidate the hardahip of individual situations, likewise hardships don't invalidate health guidance."
14948,"Everyone has a justification for not following guidance in their individual situation, some justifications are better than others."
14949,I'm not really commenting on any justifications or individual situations beyond saying the virus doesn't care about our own personal lines.

14951,"At the national level, notifications of laboratory-confirmed influenza have substantially decreased since mid-March and remain low."
14952,"No, they didn't."
14953,The FDA specifically blocked the approval of Thalidomide and made sure it was contraindicated with pregnancy when it was eventually confirmed for safety and efficacy.
14954,Because it IS safe and effective if you're not pregnant.
14955,"The US avoided the brunt of the Thalidomide scandal thanks to the FDA, which seems like the opposite of the point you're trying to make"
14956,Not in NJ but when I got the virus in September the contact tracers contacted me 6 days after I took my test and 8 days after I experienced symptoms.
14957,They then forced my roommate to take a test (he got symptoms a day later and had been quarantining with me) and quarantine for a 14 day period after their week late phone call.

14968,"&gt;Up next, Jesus."
14969,Did you call me?
14970,Jesus is s very common name in Spain.
14971,I've always wondered why there's not a similar version on other countries.
14972,A CNN article today on how the US will do it is: elderly in care homes / assisted living (1% of the population but 40% of the deaths).
14973,"Next will be front-line / essential workers (from police and fire to teachers to food processors &amp; distribution / food store workers); 

Third phase, the over-65s and people with high-risk health conditions."
14974,I had zero problems getting mine last month.
14975,Literally was in and out of the building in 10 minutes.
14976,Is that not common?
14977,"If they reserved more doses than “anywhere,” then they reserved more doses for Canada than they reserved for Canada."
14978,"But those at any real risk from Covid will have likely been vaccinated by late Feb.

Those who haven't been vaccinated by April are likely to be young, healthy adults with no morbidities."
14979,It's outright evil to stay shut down once the entire justification for lockdowns - overwhelmed hospitals - is no longer a possibility.
14980,We don't know.
14981,"Probably you are safe for a few months, but you might not be."
14982,"Please wear a mask: even if you are safe, nobody else knows you are not a liar claiming to have recovered just to avoid the mask without caring about others."
14983,You absolutely misinterpreted and don’t ever lump me in with the hoax crowd.
14984,I take this very seriously and follow all the guidelines.
14985,I’ve never once thought any of this was fake or a hoax or about jamming microchips up my ass.
14986,I just don’t see how the numbers could get THAT high.
14987,Like the US fucking cares.
14988,They should be able to know that right?
14989,They already have the information of how many covid cased were in placebo vs non placebo groups after the first shot but before the second one.
14990,"Ngl, on first pass I read it as 6 doses, and I was like ""I don't think that'll be enough..."""
14991,"That’s one of the other replies, don’t worry."
14992,"True, true."
14993,"And if we're being *really* precise: if there's no one to staff the bed, I'm probably not getting admitted in the first place."
14994,Bork bork!
14995,We have an order of 100 million doses and we will be getting the moderna vaccine too so that should be a good start at least
14996,Perfect age to start.

15002,"This is the same debate various countries had in the nineteenth century over what is more important, disease surveillance or doctor-patient confidentiality."
15003,I'm not going to spoil which side of the debate was wrong there.
15004,"Regardless of ulterior motives, data is necessary for managing a pandemic like this."
15005,"I would think that the most important part is address, so that health officials know which neighborhoods are sufficiently vaccinated and which ones need to be targeted for more vaccination."
15006,"Likewise, age is also needed to answer the question of whether or not the vaccines are going to the most prioritized vulnerable people."
15007,The other things like names and ethnicity are probably not necessary.
15008,Real question: is there any news about what the US will require from them for approval for this vaccine/how long could that take?
15009,have given a lengthy reply above.... review it if you like.
15010,it is raw data.
15011,I would rather talk about theories Or other Raw data to explain it - but I did provide instructions to find the raw data I used.

15032,Hi all.
15033,"Don’t know if anyone will see this, but here goes:

Does anyone have any reading material I could read to help assuage my concerns about getting the Covid vaccine?"
15034,"I’m not an anti-vaxxer by any means, and my kids always have their shots up to date."
15035,"The disinformation must be getting to me, because this one makes me nervous, I don’t even know why."
15036,Maybe because it feels rushed?
15037,I’d love some science to help me with my fears.
15038,"UK has a longer life expectancy than the US, so your logic falls apart."
15039,We should be trusting the UK authorities more than the FDA.
15040,"When I was losing weight, my dad told me to stop because i was looking too skinny yet I still had man titties lol."
15041,Or *Oxford-AstraZeneca: Better than nothing!
15042,*
15043,"So if the statement about not transmitting is inconclusive, it sounds like we will still be wearing masks for quite a while."
15044,What is the point in spreading this bullshit statement?
15045,Does it make you feel good or something?
15046,It would be great if people would be more conscientious about hygiene and wear masks when they have cold/flu symptoms in the  post-vaccine future.
15047,"For those who still get sick after receiving both vaccine doses, I could be mistaken, but I believe the participants in the Moderna vaccine trials who got sick didn’t have serious illness."
15048,That’s compared to the placebo group that did have cases of serious illness.
15049,"So the vaccine should (hopefully) prevent people from becoming seriously ill. Kinda like how you can still catch the flu after being vaccinated, but you’ll probably just have a mild illness instead of a serious one."
15050,"Perhaps (I am as ignorant as they come, so it is just a guess), it is better to have 95% efficiency for people in danger and 0% on people with little risk of dying because of covid."
15051,"So, until there is no longer shortage, it will be two doses for groups at risk, and when there is no longer that much shortage and regular people can start to be vaccinated we can just get the 60% efficacy (but death rate should be very low by then)."
15052,"I don’t think the flu shot does much against getting infected, either"
15053,This is more dangerous than NNN
15054,It also wasn’t common sense to wipe down groceries before putting them in the fridge.
15055,You bet people are still going to be doing that post pandemic.
15056,Don’t wear a mask while you have a cold and are symptomatic if ya want to.
15057,Don’t really care at the present.
15058,Stay healthy though!
15059,First to get the Pfizer vaccine.
15060,"Russia has given their vaccine to many people, but it hasn't yet completed a proper clinical trial."
15061,I'm not sure about the Chinese vaccine.
15062,"But those who haven't been vaccinated by, say, April, are the people at effectively zero risk of Covid being more than a passing temperature for them."
15063,This WHOLE THING was justified on the basis of overwhelmed hospitals.
15064,That risk ends - done - as soon as 50-100m most vulnerable have been vaccinated.

15115,The fda may not be getting the raw data.
15116,You don’t know that they are.
15117,They may be reviewing a section of the thousands of pages of source documents in what’s called risk based auditing.
15118,But source documents are not the compiled raw data.
15119,It amazing how much misinformation is highly upvoted here.
15120,Academics can sometimes be suing a company for years to get the raw data.
15121,The company owns the data.
15122,You don’t know what the fda is receiving from them.
15123,That’s not disclosed.

15142,"Some nations you can drive without a seatbelt, so why can't we?"
15143,"Some nations allow people to work in construction sites without helmets or ropes, so why don't we?"
15144,We're all human.
15145,"The 7 day rolling average is a much more meaningful number than these 1 day totals, which can vary wildly based on testing backlogs from weekends, holidays, etc."
15146,I agree it’s unfortunate.
15147,But it’s very likely Moderna will show the same results.
15148,So we are looking at at least 100m people getting a “good vaccine”.
15149,That’s close to 1/3 of the population so your chance depending on age/ health isn’t actually that bad.
15150,"Also we don’t know about the J&amp;J or Novavax vaccine but assuming you think 90% is good, then it’s possible that one can still be good."
15151,Oxford vaccine potentially is 90% as well but even at 70% it’s still not a *bad* option.
15152,Lol just when I was getting excited about off planet exploration you had to ruin it.
15153,"So for people like you that don’t care about life, there is also the cost of all the hospitalizations in the outbreak, which is almost certainly many millions if we have six deaths."

15155,"There is a new research saying that even lungs repair just fine after covid, not like they thought in the first place."
15156,"That’s just dumb, follow the protocol."
15157,"No one expected a worldwide pandemic, except for George W. Bush, so prepare for the shipment to be delayed."
15158,20 million fully vaccinated is better then double half assed vaccinated.
15159,Since the 2nd vaccine is a timed dose then getting it delayed would basically cut down the effectiveness.

15185,It's about how the U.S. Is currently burning to the ground amidst the pandemic and that thing they've been telling us would save the day is not being supplied in amounts that are actually going to save the day.

15192,"I work in a bank that is inside a grocery store so I spend 40 hrs or so in the store- it’s gotten better over time, but still, about 1/3 of my customers each day do not wear a mask."
15193,"We have several that refuse to and are very open about the fact that they have never worn one, still travel and have big get togethers."
15194,"Weekly I hear people say that the flu kills more people each year, or they go on about the fact that “no one” is dying of heart attacks or car accidents (even though I see death certificates on a nearly weekly basis at my job and have never seen Covid listed as a cause of death on a dc)."
15195,"Compliance may be great in many parts of the country, or in places where government officials take this seriously, and it’s GREAT that it is in yours, but that is not the case all over the place, and not just small towns."
15196,"I live just outside of Nashville, and let me tell you, Nashville is still a huge tourist trap right now."
15197,Nashville itself still has some regulations- but most of the rest of the state is 100% open other than schools being mostly hybrid.
15198,And just because people are wearing them in stores where they are required for entrance doesn’t mean people are wearing them properly or being responsible with them outside of those areas.
15199,"Joe Smith could wear them perfectly when he grocery shops, attend a massive house party later that night, and head to work Monday morning."
15200,"This order is most likely largely symbolic and just puts in writing what was already the plan, no country is going to prioritize other nations over their own."
15201,For what it's worth this order does direct some federal agencies to work with facilitating worldwide distribution.
15202,"This order lets Trump score some easy points with his base by letting them think he's doing something special to put ""America First."""

15204,Does anywhere in the world have a higher transmission rate (R(t)) than California right now?
15205,"Part of it may be hangover from the holidays when less tests were processed, but while other states experienced a dip, CA just leveled out for a few days."
15206,What's the point of putting testing in place if changes in cases/day does not guide policy?
15207,R(t) is by far the most important number and one CA officials rarely talk about.
15208,Early on testing was not good enough to determine R(t) with any confidence.
15209,Now it is and we are fucked.
15210,The time to shut down was three weeks ago at least.
15211,Let them live in mansions.
15212,Its not that complicated.
15213,"I find it a bit sad how people are up and arms about lockdowns due to covid, then complaining that stores are open barely, then complaining about not fully opening."
15214,I hope the vaccine does something.
15215,This is literally just a big fire that might become too big to be doused.
15216,How does that relate to what I wrote?
15217,"We have no idea what the long-term effects of having Covid would be, and we know that viruses can linger in the body and cause problems decades later."
15218,I'm just saying people should be consistent in their logic.
15219,Must have been nice to own two full houses when some people can't even afford to own one.
15220,But you can file for workers compensation under L&amp;I if you get covid at work.
15221,I don't need luck.
15222,We've had one of the best COVID response programs in the country.
15223,"Most of our small businesses are open and thriving, yet we are SEVENTEENTH in the country in deaths-per-capita, behind New York and Cuomo, who just wrote a book about how losing 30,000 people in the first months is somehow a good thing."
15224,**Jensen thinks it could be up to two months before the state’s health care workers are vaccinated.

15228,Mods - which scientific/medical journals are considered acceptable to post in this thread?
15229,Will you post a list of acceptable journals?
15230,Except of course in restaurants and bars because magic.
15231,"Well you can showing it to certain degree with contact tracing and genetic analysis, but maybe not enough for a court."
15232,"The proof might be hard with that strategy, but otherwise I think it is morally like putting kids on a bus with faulty brakes."
15233,You can show that someone held a person hosted a 300 person even on their property when the max is in WA state is about 5.
15234,"That’s way easier to prove, and if the penalties are set right then rational venues will do the right thing to preserve their business"
15235,I came to say this.
15236,So now what is our next goal?
15237,"I’m seriously asking, what is next leading cause of deaths in the US?"
15238,Honestly my use of 'onset' was generous.
15239,"It is likelier that they conceived in the late spring or later, and by then we definitely knew of the severity of the pandemic."
15240,"I asked a pretty simple question, and one most responsible to-be parents should ask and know the answer(s) to."
15241,Hospital decides vs mother decides.
15242,This is hard for you to understand?
15243,Are you building bridges?
15244,Doing a real lockdown.
15245,Our classrooms are overcrowded and we already have a huge substitute shortage in normal non-Covid years.
15246,We also can't keep doors or windows open due to intruders and school shooting protocols.
15247,Our schools have bad ventilation.
15248,We just have different challenges.
15249,Atleast France did something unlike here in the US.
15250,We're shattering new records every single day.
15251,The vaccine doesn't care about borders.
15252,"Theoretically, America could just vaccinate everyone and let the rest of the world die, but does that sound like a good thing to you?"
15253,"Helping other people helps our relationships around the world, and that's important."
15254,"Trump tries to isolate us, but we're still part of the world."
15255,"As an example, all healthcare workers around the world need it before your average American celebrity (if they don't have risk factors)."
15256,The fact that you’re ignoring is that was zero risk to the government.
15257,They were offered the right of first refusal for more doses and they in fact refused.
15258,"If, like you say the vaccine had failed."
15259,The government wouldn’t have been on the hook for a dime.
15260,There would be no loss of any kind.
15261,"It was a success and now we can’t get more doses because after we refused, other countries said yes please."
15262,"They didn’t take warp speed money because they didn’t want political influence to cast doubt on what they believed, rightfully so, would be a successful vaccine."
15263,"There was no downside to reserving more doses, only to refusing to and this exact situation arising."
15264,That my friend is an unconscionable amount of incompetence.
15265,Some immunity in that population is better than what we have now at least.
15266,that’s why republicans in the senate want to quash all covid liability.
15267,"They don’t want those who have engaged in large scale negligence, like venues hosting gatherings in violation of health standards, getting sued."
15268,"Based on the information in the article, they’ve found a legal way to allow people to get food for takeout and seat themselves at public seating areas."
15269,There isn’t any data showing spread from people dining outdoors.
15270,The state is shutting people down but doing nothing to compensate them.
15271,"In fact, restaurants were told what equipment and supplies they needed to create outdoor dining spaces - one restaurant in Sherman Oaks spent $80,000 to setup outdoor dining, only to be shut down."
15272,While they’re letting a movie production company setup outdoor catering tents 50 feet from her restaurant which is shut down.
15273,Those people are out unemployment.
15274,One of her former employees is now homeless.
15275,We are destroying people in situations where there is no meaningful risk of spread.
15276,How much more can people take?
15277,It's not a fact.
15278,You have no evidence that it is not happening.
15279,You've only provided evidence that the CDC is slightly recommending a certain action.
15280,How do you not understand this?
15281,"With this level of inability to understand simple logical, I bet I can guess who you voted for (If you're american)"
15282,Wow.

15284,I really hope your wife will be okay.
15285,Question for the mods: We all know how unreliable weekend data is but people continue to post them.
15286,Why don't you ban it and only allow people to post rolling weekly averages?
15287,"What was it again, something like play stupid games win stupid prizes?"
15288,They aimed a $2500 rifle at the facts and are calling for backup.
15289,"And to the people and businesses and workers that actually need it, not these massive corporations who will turn around and give a bonus to the ceo."
15290,Or ya know....trump and kushners own companies.
15291,Or in Mitch’s case wanting a no-liability clause put in for companies whose employees get sick from Covid.
15292,Pfizer has already guaranteed to Canada to receive their first quarter million doses before the end of the month.
15293,"If the cared about the unborn, they'd give mothers access to affordable or fully government funded prenatal care"
15294,"I've always wondered as a foreigner, which is bigger thanksgiving or christmas?"
15295,"(assuming a family actually celebrates christmas)

Because it's essentially the same thing one month apart."
15296,Can we do something about heart disease?
15297,"Covid making us change our lives, why not do the same for heart disease and aggressively tone down food that’s harmful to your arteries, high stress etc"
15298,"Or you get laid off, your boss took a bunch of PPP money, business is still fine in fact doing *better* because of what the company does, and I'm like trying to barter with motels for cheaper rates on week stays because I'm homeless."
15299,Also the world's population will peak around 10 billion and then start going down.
15300,"When kids reliably live to adulthood, birth rates plummet."
15301,Are you saying that most people who’ve saved 10k do so through luck?
15302,If so I completely disagree.
15303,That was probably as a hedge for Trump forcing the FDA to approve a vaccine right before the elections.

15309,Must be the first piece of good news in a while for the new normal crew
15310,Rapid onset of a similar magnitude of symptoms in a population isn't really how infectious disease works.
15311,Sad that we have to treat tens of millions of full grown adults in the same way you have to treat kids.
15312,"Pretend that they're right, and that they did it all themselves just to get them to do the right thing, when all they did was stand around and watched."
15313,"Seeing that the US is averaging 2k a day and just 8k away from 300, I think you’re right."
15314,Depends on whether folks are being honest with themselves.
15315,Plenty of people won’t admit that they’d rather stay home than be ostracized by family members for bowing out.
15316,I’ve heard too many people in real life say how they wish they had an excuse to stay home or lament family gatherings they could have avoided.
15317,It’s not that plenty of people don’t like family either.
15318,"It’s just that people don’t want to have the expectations of the season, piled upon seeing some family members they’d rather avoid."
15319,"During a post election year period, that can be magnified."

15462,"When the season started in September, tickets were limited to two per player and the spectators that were at games did a good job of spacing out and the vast majority properly wore masks."
15463,"Then around the start of October, the state allowed more people to come to games and naturally people got complacent."
15464,"Mask wearing overall in the crowds was decent, but after the games people would all just mingle with players like normal and a lot of masks would come off."

15466,Some of the bigger stadiums still had near 1000 people in them and distancing was ignored.

15468,"Parents also flipped their shit when players were required to wear masks at all times, but it was left up to the school administrators to actually enforce it."
15469,Naturally for football it's scantly enforced.

15487,Mega church pastors are grifters who prey people’s beliefs for their personal gains.
15488,"They don’t care about criticism, they have bills to pay."
15489,Am wary of China exporting their vaccines before having vaccinated a significant percentage of their own population.
15490,It certainly makes it look like other countries are the test subjects.
15491,You misunderstand what the order does.
15492,It has nothing to do with Moderna or Pfizer contracts.
15493,All it does is stop our own foreign aid programs from buying the vaccine and sending it to impoverished countries.
15494,That is fucked up.
15495,This is a legitimate story.
15496,I can probably name who removed it.
15497,So hundred millions more than 500 million vaccines for a country that has a population less than 400 million????
15498,Can you cite where you read this to validate your claims?

15503,"No evidence, except for, you know, all those studies that you already stated you ignore."
15504,Nobody ever said that masks were the greatest medical innovation since penicillin.
15505,They are one of many things that the common person can do to aid in reducing the exponential spread of a virus.
15506,Careful.
15507,Big brother is watching.
15508,"&gt; Idk until Obama takes and it's find I'll take but s many I know wouldn't

So you guys are gonna believe what you see on TV that supposedly Obama or other politicians take a vaccine?"
15509,Since when do we trust politicians and media so much?
15510,You know it's the easiest thing to fake it on TV and get water into your arm instead of a vaccine?
15511,you know that you can get vaccinated and still transmit the virus?
15512,"Masks help but they don't provide immunity, plus Hong Kong residents have a bad track record of following orders and listening to authorities."
15513,I hope they are banned from traveling to the rest of China until they get their shit together.
15514,If you run over someone in your car by negligence you can get four years in prison.
15515,How is this different?
15516,"Right, if you say so."
15517,Not trying to attack you personally but this is the characteristic of clickbait headlines and articles: relying on heuristics and presumptions to deceive people into click the article.
15518,"While not technically wrong, the crafting of language is undoubtedly intentionally deceitful."
15519,The Independent and Daily Mail are notorious for clickbait articles amongst the British journals.
15520,"If you aren't aware, r/worldnews has automated sticky warning readers of the clickbait tendencies of The Independent, whenever one of their articles are posted; and users regularly report the site as such because it is that bad."

15529,I mean the virus passes indoors in spaces without much ventilation.
15530,It seems obvious it would spread in a restaurant when you HAVE to spend time with a mask off to do the very thing you do in a restaurant.
15531,I have no idea why people would think otherwise?
15532,Yes temps hired by the facility and also I’ve been in some places in my state where families directly hire staff from their preferred agency to work with the resident.

15626,If this is the actual number from the tests and that it is estimated (due to asymptomatic or mild symptom carriers) to be six times higher I suppose it is higher than 1 in 22.
15627,You should be good to go maskless by like August or so at the very latest.
15628,The experts that have spent their lives dealing with virus like this are telling you what they are.

15705,"Other interesting notes: 

* Asians are by far the most willing to get a vaccine 
1. upper income is much more likely to get a vaccine (which is interesting because they're often also least exposed to the virus) 
* men are more likely to get vaccinated than women
* Older demographics are the MOST likely to want a vaccination"

15784,You basically chose not to get vaccinated so you getting covid is on you.
15785,No

15809,Id just think the people who are spreading it are the main problem.
15810,obviously healthcare workers need it first but after that all the people wont stay home or cant.

15814,I doubt it those getting the vaccine first tend to take it more seriously id imagine.
15815,Well i figured as much.
15816,I am sad.
15817,This.
15818,Two crashes and many near misses of a new version of a well-flown model caused by a poorly designed/written software system that Boeing declared wasn't critical as to avoid a more strenuous review process.
15819,Pilots weren't informed about it or how to deal with it in any way that mattered.
15820,"It was supposed to provide gentle corrections to avoid stall situations that would cause the plane to drop out of the sky, but instead kept overcorrecting it straight into the ground instead."
15821,"It also only used one sensor by default, which could give erroneous data."
15822,"Complaints about the planes began immediately but it wasn't until two planes became craters that the FAA grounded it, and was one of the last to do so."
15823,All of this to avoid the more lengthy process to have a competitor to Airbus's new plane sooner.
15824,(Which they had to go through anyways as the result of unheard of crashes of brand new planes in modern day history.)
15825,That's what you get by taking companies at their word.
15826,All it takes is one instance like that turning into a fustercluck to destroy lives and the public's trust.
15827,"And, no, you can't redesign an entire review process during something this critical."
15828,"Not only would it lengthen the time for approval, but it would make it more likely for something to get missed."
15829,The fact we're still getting this vaccine so soon after this pandemic started is a flipping miracle won by the hard work of thousands around the world.
15830,We're witnessing a revolution in medicine of a new breed of vaccines.
15831,"With so many already mistrusting the vaccines coming out, the FDA can't afford to mess up the approval process."
15832,"That could cause lasting damage that could impact public acceptance of vaccines, both routine and emergency, for decades to come."

15834,He had a practice run during the HIV pandemic.
15835,Beer (&lt;10%) wasn’t considered an alcoholic beverage in Russian until 2011.
15836,It was classified as a food stuff.
15837,"First of all, the medical advice is that people wear masks outside of their own homes, so you you are asking people to go above and beyond medical advice."
15838,The sort of recommendations Fauci for example has given have been very understanding of realistic human behavior.
15839,"Second of all, of course medical advice should be something that is actually realistic to follow."
15840,During the HIV epidemic just telling people not to have sex didn’t work and made things worse.
15841,What has been more effective is encouraging reasonable precautions such as using condoms.
15842,People aren’t going to live their lives without sex and they aren’t going to go a year not touching their spouse.
15843,Advice is pointless if following it isn’t realistic.
15844,"Third of all, the way you are claiming to have no opinion when clearly you do seems disingenuous and leaves a bad taste in my mouth."
15845,You didn’t make that comment because you don’t care about their choice.
15846,"You do care, and I would appreciate your argument more if you said what you so obviously mean."
15847,You think that they are making emotional justifications for medically irresponsible behavior.
15848,"That’s a judgement, and not a positive one."
15849,What diseases do you have in mind that need vaccines?
15850,It’s not just money.. vaccines are only a functional option for a subtype of illnesses and only useful in a subtype of that subtype.
15851,A highly contagious virus like covid is like the poster child for things we can solve with vaccine.
15852,"If the vaccine has tracking microchips in them, why would they need the personal data?"
15853,/s
15854,"If I could have a dime for every case, I would be $1.5 million richer."

15872,We will disagree.
15873,I'll argue losing a very large segment of young to middle aged people in 1918 dwarfs death people would experience in a traditional year.
15874,The terror and fear of death during 1918 would also dwarf a normal year.
15875,It would be akin to your house being a WWI trench as neighbors die all around you.
15876,The only war that comes close to 1918 is the civil war...which was worse than 1918 in terms of % of population.
15877,The white race making resistance to mask wearing a salient marker of identity is paying off richly for asian countries.
15878,"So if they say VE is X% (95% CI A, B), they mean the estimated vaccine efficacy is X%, but that’s an estimate based on limited data, so then they’re saying they’re 95% sure it’s actual efficacy is between A% and B%."
15879,"I also think the “-152.6” is meant to say “52.6” which matches the quote in the article saying 52% efficacy since they’re likely erring on the side of caution with saying how effective it is after one dose so as to not accidentally encourage people to skip the second dose, and 52% is kind of the worst case scenario estinate"
15880,It's annoying that they're talking about all this distribution but not actually making a way for people to sign up for it.
15881,Anecdotal but I got COVID in early June.
15882,Im in my late 20s and considered healthy and did not need to be hospitalized.
15883,It felt mostly like a flu (sans the shortness of breath).
15884,I was over it in about 4 days and feeling 100% myself within a week.
15885,Even though most of us will be unaffected or only slightly affected its still a figurative roll of the dice when you get it.
15886,Fomite transmission is rare.
15887,It’s not sweat and used equipment as the primary transmission in gyms.
15888,"Gyms spread because there are people breathing heavily, coughing, yelling, working out physically causing particles to be released in to the air that will enter others airways/eyes."
15889,I’m concerned if they didn’t test anyone with long fingernails.

15914,"My understanding is that most vaccine reactions occur within a few weeks of getting the vaccine, even if they persist longer."
15915,And most vaccine reactions don’t persist long-term.
15916,"However, another way of looking at it is that any medication or vaccine that isn’t tested for years prior to being approved could have long term effects we don’t know of."
15917,"Despite this, many people take medications that have been on the market for less than, say, 10 years, including some psych meds and antibiotics."
15918,The HPV vaccine has been around for less than 15 years.
15919,"Personally, when one weighs the potential unknown and undocumented and unproven risk of some long term effect against the very present and real risk of getting COVID and dying, infecting someone else who later dies, or ending up with long COVID symptoms, I personally will take the vaccine unless it is counter indicated due to my medical issues."

16173,Yes because you can still spread it to people.

16175,"What is it, 75% effective?"
16176,And regulators were ok with 60%?
16177,If you vaccinate enough people with that kind of success rate it’ll be enough.

16186,"100% Trump wanted to put ""TRUMP"" on tbe vaccine vials and boxes.. ."
16187,There's a difference between natural and vaccine herd immunities.
16188,"Natural herd immunity doesn't seem likely, as no known coronavirus, including this one, results in long term (years) of immunity, and not have sterilizing immunity once resolved."
16189,"That means natural herd immunity by itself likely isn't possible because it would act like colds and the flu do, where antibodies dwindle and become low enough to not bind well enough, or rather in high enough numbers, to prevent wide spread replication, and therefore disease and infectiousness."
16190,People will still spread it and get sick and there would be seasonal outbreaks.
16191,And that time my coworkers kid gave me the flu?
16192,"Hopefully our other vaccines pick up the slack, but I do get the feeling this has been known for some time by experts."
16193,"The story said that they shouldn't be able to give out more vaccines than they already are before June/July, which I doubt impacts the initial timelines substantially."
16194,So how long ‘til Trump gets back on the anti-vaxx train?
16195,I'm told that this can't be given to children who are 24% of the population.

16206,"I can't believe  your partner would put their own entertainment over public safety and invite friends to gather in their backyard with them

Sickening"
16207,Because 90% effectiveness isn't 100% effectiveness.
16208,"You're right, if you get it and it works, you don't need to be too worried about herd immunity, but there's a chance it won't work for you, or there are people who won't be able to get the vaccine for genuine medical reasons."
16209,"For those people, herd immunity matters a lot."
16210,They don’t need to prove anything.
16211,The smart play is to get the vaccines approved and distributed.

16216,She is under investigation for unauthorized access and use of Florida’s communication system.
16217,I think Knows-something assumed that the article was talking about restricting international travelers unless they are vaccinated.
16218,The title sort of suggests this but that would be far too intelligent a decision from Trump.
16219,From the little text I could read (requires subscription) it sounds like the article is suggesting that no help would be given to other countries before the vaccine is distributed internally.
16220,"However, I could have gotten that wrong."
16221,If someone can get past the paywall they can elaborate.
16222,"In Australia, the airline Qantas said they would require proof of vaccination for international flights."
16223,"TBH, I think all airlines should require this, irrespective of government requirements."
16224,"We have all seen firsthand what happens when an incompetent government is in charge during a pandemic (US, Brazil etc)."

16288,I wonder how many of them actually went through the court files and actually tried to understand exactly what was going on.
16289,The case involved a few individuals who argued they didn't need to be quarantined as the Ct values of their test results were very high.
16290,"The argument is that at values in the high 30s, they've recovered and are no longer infectious and do not need to quarantine."
16291,A paper corresponding Ct values and live virus isolation was used to support their claim.
16292,"In other words, this has nothing to do with whether or not PCR works."
16293,It definitely does work and anyone arguing otherwise likely does not have an understanding of how the test actually functions.
16294,"**Rather, the argument is regarding the interpretation of PCR test results."
16295,"**

At the end of the day, the world is experiencing excess deaths significantly above the mean for 2020."
16296,"Regardless of whether or not the test works, the reality is that there is a virus that is causing much more death than usual."

16355,And learned to type complex password well (cause kids need password completely policies of course).
16356,I am actually not kidding - I do think that it's a valuable lesson that electronics don't always work as expected and one may need to restart things at times or try different approaches to achieve desired results.
16357,But I am not sure this is part of school curriculum.
16358,"The rest of education, however, is fairly useless."
16359,Meetings are a complete mess because somebody always has their mic on and you can barely understand what teacher is saying.

16681,This was the main thing that the US federal government was doing.
16682,They forced some ventilators to be made and they said they were buying and stockpiling a ton of vaccines even before we knew if they were any good.
16683,"Oh yeah, and we have millions of doses of hydroxychloroquine, I forgot that."
16684,"I'm glad we have multiple good vaccines, but every month of extra suffering is going to cost thousands of lives and tens of billions of dollars."
16685,I remember arguing with some people on this very sub about that.
16686,It amazes me that they are literate at all.
16687,&gt;Do we know yet if vaccinations stop you from infecting others if you have been vaccinated?
16688,"Nope, or at least Pfizer doesn't."
16689,"I'm guessing they're looking a lot at individual protection of the vaccine as well

So, my personal logic is just that the USA expects to have 100 million people vaccinated by end of March, which eclipses healthcare workers and at risk groups."
16690,"I think by that point, we should be looking at easing most restrictions since on paper hospitalizations/deaths should be pretty low

The warp speed head thinks we could be normal by May due to having herd immunity through vaccination... Fauci thinks between april-july we could see ""relative normal""."
16691,"If I had to guess, they're confident the vaccine protects the groups it's prioritizing pretty effectively"

16694,"Reason I ask is bc my father in law fits pretty much the exact description of age / risk factor, and yet he thinks it’s all over blown and still goes to the gym."
16695,"So while yes it’s our duty to mask up, the vulnerable also have a responsibility to understand their risk factors and act accordingly."
16696,"Again, I know nothing of your dad and hope he’s going to be okay, but it’s an unfortunate trend I’ve noticed with my parents and my husbands parents, meaning, we seem to be more concerned for their health than they are."

16701,"If you work in healthcare or education, not taking it could also mean getting fired from your job, but I'm going to assume that you perhaps work in a low risk field."
16702,"Most of these companies have also tested between 30-60k volunteers in their trial phases, so anyone taking it after FDA approval is hardly a 'test bunny' ...but certainly, you can feel how you feel and get the shot when you are ready; while continuing to social distance and wear PPE."

16791,Could it also not have a net zero influence on hospitalisation though due to some people being more relaxed as they hear of vaccinations being distributed and lower there guard thinking their on the back end of the infections?
16792,Do we know yet if vaccinations stop you from infecting others if you have been vaccinated?
16793,I read that they weren't sure which vaccine also stopped you being a transmitter and this could also drive hospitalisations if vaccinated people are being carefree thinking they have no influence on the virus spreading.

17098,It’s black.
17099,I read the whole article and it was interesting but it was very soft on clearly linking the Spanish Flu specifically to what you reference.
17100,"Many of the architectural designs referenced (such as large windows, air flow, etc) were common in high-end architecture of years past."
17101,It was known for a long time that getting enough sunlight and fresh air was good for you.
17102,It's just that the 1920's and beyond were the first times that lower- and middle-class people were able to afford that luxury in much of the rapidly developing world.
17103,"Most of what is ultimately referenced is also because of changing production methods.. such as:

&gt; ""Minimalist designs replaced carved wood and upholstery, where bacilli-containing dust could linger and become vectors of disease."
17104,"Instead, designers used lightweight, washable materials in streamlined forms."
17105,"Michael Thonet used bentwood and cane, Aalto used bent plywood, and Marcel Breuer and Mies van der Rohe used tubular steel."
17106,"Easily moved for cleaning, this furniture deprived dust and insects of hiding places in the dark"" 

In other words, as they have throughout history, designers used emerging technology in their palette: mass-produced steel, manufactured wood, and more modern mass-produced weaves of fabric."
17107,"I don't want to say there is *zero* correlation, but many of those trends and preferences were inevitable."
17108,"The ornate, handcrafted designs of the past became the mass-produced, mass-market materials of the future."

17110,"My husband's hours were cut at his job, but he was one of the lucky ones that didn't get laid off."
17111,This shit will never get to my body.
17112,Thats for sure.
17113,Yeah no.
17114,This new normal is shit.
17115,People can go hide in their houses if they want and wear a mask 24/7 but when the vaccine is widely distributed don’t tell me what to do.
17116,Haha I'm going to continue wearing a large mask.... and sunglasses... my face and where it has been is nobodies business!
17117,"Once the vaccine is out in the wild we're also going to have news stories where outbreaks occurred in a nursing home or school, half of the people got sick and several died, overwhelming majority of them had not taken vaccinations."
17118,Antivaxxers will continue to be an issue and they'll never shut up about their ridiculous conspiracy theories but the vast majority of people will probably choose the 'not die or have permanent damage' route once they start seeing a stark difference in prognosis.
17119,Noone is making you do it.
17120,There will never be enough.
17121,Exactly.
17122,"While healrhcare workers will be getting vaccinated first, they're already technically getting infected less than the general population."
17123,The death counts and infections from them are kinda a drop in the bucket vs regular folk.
17124,"So even with the elderly in nursing homes, 60 year olds, and others who are still at risk won't be vaccinated so soon."
17125,Maybe Febuary.
17126,So we have a bit more to go before we start seeing real positive results from the vaccine.
17127,But I also think that some positive results will be seen since a lot of deaths do occur from nursing home patients.
17128,But we all still have to keep our guard up.
17129,Not get Covid fatigue.
17130,"Not say, eh, I'll hang out just this one time."
17131,Cause that's all it takes.
17132,"So in these studies, they aren't testing participants regularly?"
17133,Only those that develop symptoms?
17134,Then how can you possibly determine efficacy of the vaccine.
17135,"Also people are un-blinding themselves based on symptoms after vaccine was given so then someone ""knows"" they got the vaccine, gets the sniffles, but ""it can't be Covid because I got the vaccine."""
17136,They fucked up their study and drawing this conclusion from the study data is dangerous.
17137,There are epidemiologists out there calling them out on it.
17138,Oxford/Astra really fucked up.

17182,"&gt;  
&gt;Some of the most common complications associated with COVID-19 included pneumonia, respiratory failure, kidney failure and sepsis or systemic inflammation, according to the [peer-reviewed research](http://www.cmaj.ca/lookup/doi/10.1503/cmaj.201686), published in the Canadian Medical Association Journal (CMAJ) on Tuesday."

17185,"&gt;

17186,"&gt;  
&gt;“The main contribution that I think the study provides is that for all these different complications, we’re giving those actual risk estimates so that clinicians and patients, if they’re concerned about a particular potential complication, they can actually get a sense of how likely it is for those to occur,” William Murk, a PhD student at the Jacobs School of Medicine &amp; Biomedical Sciences, University of Buffalo, N.Y. and co-author of the study, told Global News."

 The vaccines will be much less effective at preventing death and illness  in 2021 if they are introduced into a population where the coronavirus  is raging — as is now the case in the U.S. That’s the central argument  of [a new paper in the journal Health Affairs](https://nl.nytimes.com/f/a/RBzmLs_iSwWVprUeIVaMJA~~/AAAAAQA~/RgRhsef5P0TVaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuaGVhbHRoYWZmYWlycy5vcmcvZG9pL2Z1bGwvMTAuMTM3Ny9obHRoYWZmLjIwMjAuMDIwNTQ_Y2FtcGFpZ25faWQ9OSZlbWM9ZWRpdF9ubl8yMDIwMTIwOCZpbnN0YW5jZV9pZD0yNDgxNyZubD10aGUtbW9ybmluZyZyZWdpX2lkPTg1NDQ5NTY4JnNlZ21lbnRfaWQ9NDYzMjUmdGU9MSZ1c2VyX2lkPTBhMDlhNGUyNWNkYzMxMTM0ZjVkNTk1OTAzMGUzMjkyVwNueXRCCgAh-WLPX8KIKTRSEG1kYXRnb0BnbWFpbC5jb21YBAAAAAA~)."
17250,"(One of the authors is Dr. Rochelle Walensky of Massachusetts General Hospital, whom President-elect Joe Biden [has chosen](https://nl.nytimes.com/f/a/-MjtIaqRL3G5fxyPzSWfHg~~/AAAAAQA~/RgRhsef5P4QYAWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnN0YXRuZXdzLmNvbS8yMDIwLzEyLzA3L2JpZGVucy1jZGMtcGljay1hLXNhdnZ5LWNvbW11bmljYXRvci13aWxsLXRha2Utb3Zlci1hdC1hLXRpbWUtd2hlbi1hZ2VuY3lzLXZvaWNlLWhhcy1iZWVuLW11dGVkLz9jYW1wYWlnbl9pZD05JmVtYz1lZGl0X25uXzIwMjAxMjA4Jmluc3RhbmNlX2lkPTI0ODE3Jm5sPXRoZS1tb3JuaW5nJnJlZ2lfaWQ9ODU0NDk1Njgmc2VnbWVudF9pZD00NjMyNSZ0ZT0xJnVzZXJfaWQ9MGEwOWE0ZTI1Y2RjMzExMzRmNWQ1OTU5MDMwZTMyOTJXA255dEIKACH5Ys9fwogpNFIQbWRhdGdvQGdtYWlsLmNvbVgEAAAAAA~~) to run the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.)"
17251,An  analogy may be helpful here.
17252,A vaccine is like a fire hose.
17253,"A vaccine  that’s 95 percent effective, as Moderna’s and Pfizer’s versions [appear to be](https://nl.nytimes.com/f/newsletter/3M07wNUUoQpdMmlj0Q2sIA~~/AAAAAQA~/RgRhsef5P0TXaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cubnl0aW1lcy5jb20vMjAyMC8xMS8xOC9oZWFsdGgvcGZpemVyLWNvdmlkLXZhY2NpbmUuaHRtbD9jYW1wYWlnbl9pZD05JmVtYz1lZGl0X25uXzIwMjAxMjA4Jmluc3RhbmNlX2lkPTI0ODE3Jm5sPXRoZS1tb3JuaW5nJnJlZ2lfaWQ9ODU0NDk1Njgmc2VnbWVudF9pZD00NjMyNSZ0ZT0xJnVzZXJfaWQ9MGEwOWE0ZTI1Y2RjMzExMzRmNWQ1OTU5MDMwZTMyOTJXA255dEIKACH5Ys9fwogpNFIQbWRhdGdvQGdtYWlsLmNvbVgEAAAAAA~~), is a powerful fire hose."
17254,But the size of a fire is still a bigger determinant of how much destruction occurs.
17255,"I  asked the authors of the Health Affairs study to put their findings  into terms that we nonscientists could understand, and they were kind  enough to do so."
17256,"**The estimates are fairly stunning:**

* At  the current level of infection in the U.S. (about 200,000 confirmed new  infections per day), a vaccine that is 95 percent effective —  distributed at the expected pace — would still leave a terrible toll in  the six months after it was introduced."
17257,"Almost 10 million or so  Americans would contract the virus, and more than 160,000 would die."
17258,"*  This  is far worse than the toll in an alternate universe in which the  vaccine was only 50 percent effective but the U.S. had reduced the  infection rate to its level in early September (about 35,000 new daily  cases)."
17259,"In that scenario, the death toll in the next six months would be  kept to about 60,000."
17260,The Trump Administration and their unbelievably inept handling of this crisis will continue to do damage long after they leave.
17261,Don’t say that lmao 😂
17262,People underestimate how many votes for trump simply because they thought it would be better for their wallet.
17263,They’re not all anti vax people.
17264,The fact that people don’t get this is why they’re so confused about how close the election was.
17265,"https://www.ihrsa.org/about/media-center/press-releases/global-data-show-covid-19-transmission-in-gyms-is-rare/#:~:text=Data%20from%20three%20countries%20show,and%20not%20spreading%20COVID%2D19."
17266,"You're source doesn't really even specifically talk about gyms, it just passively mentions them lumped in with restaurants, churches and schools."
17267,Because they know people are idiots and won’t take the proper precautions with out being forced.
17268,"I thought most people would have realised that when Russian president Boris Yeltsin was found drunk in the streets of Washington in his underpants trying to find pizza, during his US state visit."
17269,"I ordered anti-fog wipes, but more importantly- I order  a different mask."
17270,No fogging anymore.
17271,Thanks your comment made me try something new!
17272,[deleted]
17273,You also want to be sure that you don’t blow it given that this is possibly going into 100 million people in the US in the next 4 months.
17274,"There’s a huge leap for the FDA because fundamentally for a vaccine you are vaccinating *healthy* people, so the standards are much higher."
17275,Obviously this is counterbalanced with the disease itself.
17276,Not only that they aren’t just reviewing the efficacy but literally thousands of pages on quality control.
17277,How does Pfizer control lots for efficacy?
17278,What analysis do they do at the end of every single production run to validate that it meets the product specifications?
17279,How do they tell activity?
17280,Has that activity assay been validated?
17281,Etc.
17282,I could go on for hours.
17283,"Beyond the actual mRNA itself there are other ingredients like the lipids which are equally fundamental to how it works, and then how the mRNA is encapsulated (the process), the formulation, how it’s frozen, accelerated aging studies."
17284,And this happens for literally every single lot of the drug.
17285,... give it to people?
17286,(That’s my vote anyway)
17287,Plans are worth the paper they are printed on.
17288,The major problem in the beginning of the pandemic was a shortage of PPE.
17289,"Specifically, ventilators were in great demand."
17290,Ventilators cannot be purchased and just stashed away without a thought; they have a shelf life and need to be replaced every few years.
17291,This requires funding and spending tax dollars every year.
17292,"Further, another issue was the standard of care was an issue (early venting was commonplace early in the pandemic) which likely resulted in more loss of life."
17293,Some kind of Federal pandemic plan would not change this.
17294,What's the end date on that study?
17295,Take the vaccine.
17296,"If you don't need it, upvote."
17297,"If you are a brain dead member of the herd, dogpile."
17298,Nope.
17299,This is a deadly virus period.
17300,Where’s the one that’s 95% effective with just 1 shot?
17301,I want that one.
17302,That’s because of racist medical staff which includes nurses and doctors.
17303,We knew that.
17304,Aren’t they supposed to be reviewing whether it is safe or not?
17305,Who is getting mad?
17306,You can find nuts who say the delay was massive and unnecessary.
17307,"Or nuts who say it's going way too fast because vaccine development is supposed to take X number of years (because that's tradition, I guess?)."
17308,But it seems pretty reasonable to me.
17309,They had to do the trials and wait enough time to get sufficient statistics based on enough cases in the control group that they had already calculated beforehand.
17310,"Then the companies had to analyze the data and submit their applications for review, and the FDA had to review it."
17311,It seems like it's going about right.
17312,"Sorry kiddo, but school will be back in session this spring."
17313,I wonder how many fear repercussion for saying they were out past a curfew or at a large gathering.
17314,The same thing will happen this time.
17315,"We, as a society, will do everything we can to forget about it as quickly as possible."
17316,"The reason is, so many people reacted badly, and then they got sick and paid for it."
17317,Do you want to remember that?
17318,"Every family, every friend circle, has bad actors in it."
17319,"By the end, it will be clear the anti-maskers are responsible for catastrophe and death, and they suffered it themselves and paid for it."
17320,Do we want to remember that?
17321,"Do we want to put up memorials and have family members visit and point fingers at each other and say ""I told you so!""?"
17322,There are no heroes in this story.
17323,Unless you want to put up statues to overworked nurses and fast-food servers and corporate interests who developed vaccines.
17324,"Well, maybe nurses deserve a statue."
17325,"But mostly, there was a lot more selfishness and tragedy than needed to happen, and how do you make a memorial to that?"
17326,The reason there will be no memorials is because such a huge portion of the population ought to be ashamed of themselves.

17412,The chances of backfire are slim to none.
17413,Vaccines get out of your system very quickly.
17414,"The worst side effects tend to occur very quickly and are either catching the actual virus (can't happen with these vaccines as they're not attenuated [weakened] vaccines), or else a severe reaction from your immune system, normally when the dosage is too high."
17415,Both of these tend to show within the first week or two.
17416,Vaccines just don't cause side effects months later like other drugs can.
17417,As for how it happened so quickly it's mostly funding.
17418,"Normally it would take months to get funding, with covid it was weeks."
17419,"Getting volunteers for studies takes a long time, again this was different, they got basically unlimited volunteers."
17420,"Another thing is that normally you need to wait years for a study because you have to wait for enough participants to be infected, with covid because it was so infectious and widespread the timeline could be moved up considerably."
17421,Enough of the participants got infected for a conclusion to be drawn.
17422,Also there's a luck component.
17423,Covid was a relatively easy virus to make a vaccine for.
17424,Some viruses like HIV are much more difficult but viruses like smallpox and polio are much easier.
17425,Nowadays we're stuck with the viruses that are difficult to make vaccines for because we've vaccinated against the rest of them.

17437,"I’m not super clear on the formulations, but it might only partially be to help protect the RNA."
17438,"The possibility is if the delivery vehicle is some sort of lipid nano particle, changes in temperature can affect particle size and thus decrease transduction efficiency."
17439,"Warmer temps can allow nano particles to conglomerate into bigger micelles, and this will be dependent on the formulation."
17440,Some walk it off type shit
17441,There are no adjuvants in any of the candidates besides NovaVax.
17442,In this case mRNA is immunostimulatory enough on its own.
17443,The flu vaccine is also far from first gen.
17444,The accidental half dose was also a different study in a different country.
17445,There are a lot of variables that come into play.
17446,60% of the adult Russians are alcoholics.
17447,"More than 30% of all deaths in Russia in 2012 were attributable to alcohol, according to WHO data crunched by the OECD."

17618,Identifying individuals at highest risk of COVID-19 death may help allocation prioritization efforts.
17619,Personalized risk prediction that uses a broad range of comorbidities requires a cohort size larger than that reported in prior studies.

17624,"**Results** We identified 534,023 COVID-19 patients of whom 38,066 had an inpatient death."
17625,"Demographic characteristics associated with COVID-19 death included advanced age (85 years or older: aOR: 2.07; 95% CI, 1.99-2.16), male sex (aOR, 1.88; 95% CI, 1.82-1.94), and non-white race (Hispanic: aOR, 1.74; 95% CI, 1.66-1.83)."

17825,2020 was dominated by the pandemic more than any other news topic.
17826,It causes a global recession (So even libertarians are going to have to remember it).
17827,It affected everyone's daily life.
17828,Everyone knows somebody who knows somebody who got infected or died or still fights long covid.
17829,I think you’ve misunderstood.
17830,The vaccine doesn’t make you contagious— there is no live virus.
17831,The article is saying if you’re vaccinated but pick up the virus from someone or somewhere— are you still able to transmit the virus to others?
17832,Or is the virus neutralized so much so by your new immunized status that you’re unable to infect others?
17833,The vaccine cannot cause long COVID because it does not *give* you a variation of a live virus.
17834,"For the record, most side effects with vaccines occur within the first 1-2 months so we would have likely seen serious side effects in the trial participants by now if there were any."

We are really going to have to hope that Moderna, J&amp;J, and Oxford can produce a lot more vaccines and fill the gap."
17847,2.5 million people die every year in the US and there's not much anyone can do about it as we're all mortal.
17848,COVID will increase that number by 15% this year.
17849,If that’s the case why waste all those second doses on the same people then?
17850,Or at least give the healthy and the young the option of getting only one shot while the elderly and the vulnerable be recommended to take two.
17851,With this info it just seems to me like an unnecessary strain on the supply of the vaccine
17852,Question for the science guys.
17853,"If you have the vaccine and you get infected, does the virus have a chance to mutate within you or it never gets to that point because its killed?"
17854,"If it does have the ability to mutate, is it not possible it mutates to something else that can also cause serious consequences thus another reason to wear a masks until this thing is a lot less common?"
17855,I know that mutations are rare and once in a while something happens that makes a virus or any life for that matter turn into something different.
17856,Why am I so paranoid?
17857,Because it's been a year that a lot went wrong with this virus that early on wasn't expected.
17858,So is there anything else in store for us that will surprise us?

17982,"Parties, other gatherings with many people, or meeting in new groups is inappropriate."
17983,"On the other hand, it is possible to play in small groups even outside school or preschool, provided that everyone is healthy."
17984,It is important that children can continue with their sports and leisure activities as far as possible.
17985,Sports clubs as well as other clubs can still organize activities and individual competitions or matches.
17986,"However, do not organize cups, camp activities or the like."
17987,"### Young people of high school age

Young people of upper secondary school age (born in 2004 and earlier) are expected to follow the general advice just like adults."
17988,"This means limiting new close contacts, socializing in a small circle, staying at home in case of symptoms of covid-19 and keeping your distance from others and avoiding environments with congestion."
17989,"They should also wash their hands frequently and thoroughly, or use hand disinfection, and travel in a way that minimizes the risk of infection."

17993,"Be outdoors as much as possible, keep your distance, do not share equipment with each other, avoid common changing rooms, travel to and from activities individually and minimize the number of people who meet."
17994,## What is a smaller circle?

18003,"It is important to be observant of disease symptoms and be prepared to set up meetings with other people, to avoid the risk of spreading the infection."

18013,Visits to special accommodation for the elderly may be made as long as no ban has been introduced.
18014,This must be done in a safe manner and in accordance with the accommodation's visiting routines.

18026,"A transport does not in itself contribute to the spread of infection, but there is a risk at meetings during the journey and at the destination."
18027,"Before the upcoming holidays and during Christmas, it is important to think through whether planned trips are really necessary to carry out."
18028,"The Swedish Public Health Agency recommends that you think about whether a trip to, for example, the big cities, to the mountain resort or to a holiday resort where many people meet in the same place is necessary."

18034,"If you are celebrating Christmas or another holiday with relatives or friends in a place other than the one you live in, it should be in a smaller circle."
18035,"You should not meet people outside that circle during the weekends, neither at home nor at the destination."
18036,"## Avoid congestion in Christmas and midday shopping

In connection with Christmas and mid-day shopping, it may require extra care to avoid congestion."

18041,"## About loneliness

Right now we need to avoid meeting many different people and to avoid social contexts where many people are staying at the same time."
18042,This can make you feel more alone than usual.
18043,"At the same time, close relationships and meetings in everyday life are important for feeling good."
18044,We are all different.

18120,Understatement of the new millennium right here folks.
18121,&gt; Or to find polite ways to tell their kids they’re calling too much and to get a life of their own because they’re stressing their parents out.

18130,Additionally there's always a stock dip before new year's.

18132,"Yes, and we dont victim shame them, we pity them"
18133,(avant Corona) - AC?
18134,"&gt; I got chided by a ton of people for being like the county caseworker told me like best case scenario is fall 2021

Because this is absolutely not the best case scenario."
18135,It is more like a somewhat below average case scenario.
18136,"Best case scenario is that Moderna, Pfizer, AstraZeneca, and J&amp;J are all approved by ~February and are all able to hit their production goals."
18137,"In that case, the U.S. will have all the doses it needs to vaccinate everyone by late spring."
18138,"That said, this Pfizer screw-up (and anyone who says it wasn't a screw-up is not worth listening to) makes me less confident in the best-case possibility."
18139,"Because when the government ordered vaccines, it was still very early on in the process, there was no clear idea of what vaccines would be ready first - especially considering the mRNA candidates were very new and unproven technology."
18140,"So what the government did was preorder vaccines from many many different candidates, paying upfront for a certain amount - which incurs risk of the vaccine doesn't pass it's trials or wouldn't be ready until very late into next year."
18141,"So they pre-bought a bunch from companies, including moderna - however there is a second part to these contracts, where they also are given an option to purchase x amount more vaccines with a level of priority, at a later date."
18142,You may have seen language like 'country x secures 10mil doses with option to buy 20mil more from y company'.
18143,"Canada exercised it's option to purchase more moderna supply because as more information has become available, the more it makes sense to purchase more of this particular vaccine - as other options are falling through or getting delayed, or are more challenging to administer."
18144,"When I was dating, my principle was that we meet as friends before deciding whether to date or not."
18145,Always split the first bill to avoid mooches looking for free meals.
18146,I generally think so.
18147,I'm just not ready to cross that line where the government gets to tell me that something is safe in an emergency and I have no say if I trust them or not.
18148,I'm sure it's fine but I'll let others try it first.
18149,Get ready to see a “Taming of the Flu” joke a dozen times today
18150,"I mean, I’m 27 and healthy, I will be one of the last to receive it which I’m perfectly okay with."
18151,If I can’t see my friends once we’ve all been vaccinated then what even is the point of the vaccine?
18152,"I will wear a mask on airplanes, subways etc this summer if that is still required, but I am 100% seeing friends indoors once we’re all fully vaccinated."
18153,"Not to mention, this fear of vaccinated people being super-spreaders to unvaccinated people is more than likely overblown."
18154,"Even Fauci has said that even if they can still spread it, it should be much less than people who aren’t vaccinated."
18155,The messaging is important now because we don’t know for sure.
18156,"But if they turn out to be much less likely to spread it, and once we get &gt;50% of the population vaccinated, officials are dumb if they think people will still be okay with social distancing/constant mask wearing."
18157,*Do you have any analysis for whether those advices have any effect at all?
18158,"*

\- There are a number of different factors that affect the direction in which the spread of infection goes."
18159,What we do know is that a reduced number of contacts leads to a reduced spread of infection.
18160,That is why it is important to have clear advice there.
18161,But it is not the only factor but also the compliance and the ability to follow the advice.
18162,"Immunity, temperature and humidity come into play."
18163,"We can not give an unambiguous analysis at the moment, but as you have noted, there is no clear connection between the introduction of a general advice and the fact that the curve is declining."
18164,"However, we see a declining curve in several regions, we can not say exactly what it is due to."
18165,"But reducing the number of contacts is most important, says Karin Tegmark Wisell, head of the Public Health Agency."
18166,*Will there be a more accurate analysis?
18167,"*

\- Yes."
18168,"*Trade and public transport, not so widespread?"
18169,"*

\- We see that the spread of infection takes place in the home, in cramped environments."
18170,And those environments should be avoided.
18171,We do not have many cases from public transport and other airy environments.
18172,But conditions can be created when it gets tighter and you can not protect yourself.
18173,"It is nevertheless an environment that we assess as a risk environment, however, you are right that it is not the same level of risks as in cramped spaces, Karin Tegmark Wisell, head of the Public Health Agency."
18174,*What is the legal scope for the new advice?
18175,What happens if someone does not follow the national guidelines?
18176,"*

\- For the public, there is not much we can do if you do not follow the advice, at the individual level if someone repeatedly goes against the advice and does something that increases the risk of infection, there are consequences."
18177,"But in general we can not do much, says Karin Tegmark Wisell, head of the Public Health Agency."
18178,*The picture is that Sweden has relied on reason and that people follow these advices.
18179,But you can be punished and you now have more focus on personal responsibility?
18180,Can you be brought to court?
18181,"*

\- It is unusual, but the Infection Control Act has been used for that purpose."
18182,"As I said, it is unusual, and it is on an individual level, when someone deliberately does not follow instructions that you must notify your surroundings if you are infected, and you are obliged not to pass on the infection."
18183,"I'm talking about those who intentionally, says Karin Tegmark Wisell, head of the Public Health Agency."
18184,*What are your expectations of the regions in terms of testing?
18185,"*

\- It is up to the regions to decide how to provide tests."
18186,"There is an agreement between the state and the regions through SKR, where a large-scale testing is undertaken."
18187,Then it is up to the regions how to offer tests.
18188,"From our side, we have the general recommendations and we assist where needed, says Karin Tegmark Wisell, head of the Public Health Agency."
18189,"*According to information from the region in Östergötland, they have received no help from FHM, which has made it difficult for the population to follow advice on household quarantine."
18190,What do you say about that?
18191,"*

\- If there is a suspicion of infection, you should always be at home, regardless of whether there is access to testing."
18192,The important thing is a change in behavior.
18193,"If you are ill, you should be at home."
18194,"If testing is not available, you should be home two days after you have recovered."
18195,Information about it is available on our website.
18196,"Large-scale testing is important, but it is up to the regions, says Karin Tegmark Wisell, head of the Public Health Agency."
18197,*What about the new advice for trips to Gotland?
18198,Can you travel safely to Gotland?
18199,You only get here by boat or plane.
18200,"*

\- It is important that those who arrange trips to and from Gotland ensure that you create the conditions for infection-free travel and that you can stick to your circle, says Karin Tegmark Wisell, head of the Public Health Agency."
18201,*What do you know about re-infection and protection from vaccines?
18202,"*

\- Not enough to make an exception for those who have had an infection."
18203,"In the long run, we will certainly get values ​​about the level of antibodies, but at the moment we do not have sufficient knowledge about it."
18204,Our assessment is that previous infection is not taken into account when it comes to vaccinations.
18205,"We hope that we gain more knowledge about those correlates, says Karin Tegmark Wisell, head of the Public Health Agency."
18206,*Are you worried about re-infection that it will be the same with the vaccine?
18207,"*

\- It is a different situation with vaccination, another form of trigger of the immune system."
18208,There we have to fall back on the research that is done and look at how powerfully the immune system is activated and follow how long it is activated.
18209,But it is premature to draw any conclusions more than that the tests that have been done show good effects with the vaccines that have come this far.
18210,*How to think about international travel this Christmas?
18211,"*

\- There you have to relate to the regulations that apply in the country where you are going to travel."
18212,"We can only set rules for Sweden and as we previously touched on, you must travel as little as possible and if you must travel, it must be infection-proof."
18213,"And you should stay in your small circle and not create new contacts, says Karin Tegmark Wisell, head of the Public Health Agency."
18214,*Is it possible to travel infection-proof internationally?
18215,"*

\- As with other trips, it is up to those who arrange the trip to ensure that it can take place safely."
18216,Is this a one time vaccine or once a year vaccine like the flu shot?
18217,"*The Prime Minister said that you should avoid buses and trains, you say infectious way."
18218,What does that mean?
18219,"*

\- I can not read out all our regulations, we do not have time for that."
18220,But we also say that you should preferably use other means of transport.
18221,"Not everyone has the opportunity to take their own car, bike or walk."
18222,"SJ, for example, must have more departures so it does not get crowded, for those who can not take their own car, says Bitte Bråstad, General Counsel at the Public Health Agency."
18223,*Have you been in contact with SJ?
18224,"(SJ is Swedish national railways company)*

\- I can not say if we have been in contact with SJ this time, but we have constant contact with public transport, principals, all industry organizations."
18225,We have also had a consultation procedure where everyone has had to come in with answers.
18226,"*Your latest report states that primary schools have become the most common place for the spread of infection, is it time to close the schools?"
18227,"*

\- We make an assessment that it is not relevant."
18228,What you should keep in mind when reading these statistics is that there are significantly more primary schools than upper secondary schools.
18229,So high schools are still the school environment where you have the most outbreaks.
18230,Then it is also the case that it is the ability to absorb the ability to absorb the teaching at a distance that gets better the older you get.
18231,"In addition, there are far-reaching opportunities to adapt the activities in upper secondary schools if there are signs of outbreaks."
18232,And the asset is made.
18233,"It is important to keep track of your own situation and take action when needed, says Karin Tegmark Wisell, head of the Public Health Agency."
18234,"*In Gothenburg, schools are closed earlier for Christmas."
18235,Is it a good model?
18236,"*

\- This must be assessed on the basis of each principal's area of ​​responsibility."
18237,"If there is an opportunity, there are conditions for the schools."
18238,"*This personal responsibility you are talking about today, it may not be so easy to follow if you go to school or teach?"
18239,"*

\- Everyone must try to take responsibility and think through how to spend time with friends and at school."
18240,"You should keep your distance as in all other environments, says Bitte Bråstad, General Counsel at the Public Health Agency."
18241,*Skåne stands out compared to the rest of the country in terms of infection rates.
18242,How is it that?
18243,Is it worrying?
18244,"*

\- It is absolutely worrying with the increased number of cases in Skåne."
18245,You also have to look at the burden on healthcare and then Skåne is not unique in every way.
18246,"It is moving in Skåne, but there are also variations within Skåne, we do not fully understand that until we have fully analyzed it."
18247,What we do know is that it is in close contact with people that the infection spreads.
18248,"Then there may be factors such as population structure, immunity, temperature and ability to keep your distance."
18249,Exactly why it is in Skåne we do not know today.
18250,"If we start spending more time together, there is a risk for the whole country that the infection will increase, says Karin Tegmark Wisell, head of the Public Health Agency."
18251,"*Involuntary loneliness is dangerous, has FHM made any calculations of increased mortality among those not infected with covid-19?"
18252,"*

\- We have no calculations but we follow the issue closely."
18253,We have groups at the authority that look at other aspects than just the infection control side.
18254,So it is very important to consider those aspects.
18255,"Therefore, our general advice, it is not possible to set the same yardstick for everyone."
18256,"We have different conditions, says Karin Tegmark Wisell, head of the Public Health Agency."
18257,*What are the statistics for those who have been infected twice?
18258,"*

\- WE do not have complete statistics."
18259,It's hard to follow.
18260,"We have surveys to follow it, but we also follow the knowledge internationally."
18261,We have judged that you will get a second infection but the question is when.
18262,There can be various factors: How powerful was the first infection?
18263,We assess it as a low probability that you get a second infection with high infectivity within six months.
18264,"There are individual variations and will do, says Karin Tegmark Wisell, head of the Public Health Agency."
18265,*It is not possible to answer the question how many in Sweden have been infected twice?
18266,"*

\- No, because if you get a second mild infections, it is not certain that you even notice it."
18267,"And we think it is most likely if you get an infection close by, says Karin Tegmark Wisell, head of the Public Health Agency."
18268,"*The tightened national advice, how will that change the situation?"
18269,"*

\- Hopefully this will mean that the curve flattens out and that we can see a reduced spread of infection."
18270,"It is important that everyone follows them and takes their own responsibility, says Bitte Bråstad, General Counsel at the Public Health Agency."
18271,"*Spread of infection in primary school, what is your picture?"
18272,"*

\- We see that we have had a large number of cases reported in primary school in the last two weeks and as I said earlier, we have a very large number of primary schools, so if you look at the percentage, there are few primary schools that have had outbreaks."
18273,"That is a relatively small number, says Karin Tegmark Wisell, head of the Public Health Agency."
18274,*Does eight people also apply to children and how many households can be involved?
18275,"*

\- We do not go into any numbers in our general advice."
18276,The benchmark is eight and that you should stick to your nearest circle.
18277,"If you are a single household, you may be hanging out with a few friends."
18278,You should reduce the number of circuits as much as possible and spend time in your small circle.
18279,"If you meet someone else at Christmas, it should be made infection-proof, preferably outdoors and keeping your distance, says Bitte Bråstad, General Counsel at the Public Health Agency."
18280,\- It's a little different.
18281,In my circle we are eight children and two adults and then it becomes difficult.
18282,It can look a little different.
18283,*Now I do not understand.
18284,Can you be eight adults and a few children?
18285,"*

\- It depends on your little circle."
18286,"Do you eight adults live together, so you have to think."
18287,"Those you meet daily, normally, the household, or a few friends, says Bitte Bråstad, General Counsel at the Public Health Agency."
18288,*Are you a little late with this message?
18289,"Second Advent has passed, will it bite (*kommer det bita*?maybe wrong translation?)?"
18290,"*

\- We have previously pointed out that we have a serious situation in the country."
18291,It did not go unnoticed that there are local general advice in all regions and basically national advice.
18292,We still have a very serious situation.
18293,"Our recommendations will be this tough line, says Karin Tegmark Wisell, head of the Public Health Agency."
18294,"*Foreign travelers who come and ski in Sweden, what should they think about?"
18295,"*

\- The same goes for them."
18296,They also need to socialize in their small circle and do not have multiple bubbles that interact with.
18297,"It is important to limit your contact and ensure that it is contagious, says Karin Tegmark Wisell, head of the Public Health Agency."
18298,"*From an infection control point of view, would sharper measures be needed?"
18299,"*

\- We make an overall assessment and see if it is proportional and then we use the tools we have."
18300,Then we get to follow if we need to lighten or sharpen.
18301,"But where we are now, we have come to the conclusion with experts at the authority and beyond that this is the level that suits best, says Bitte Bråstad, General Counsel at the Public Health Agency."
18302,*Is there a need to make them legally binding?
18303,"*

\- We have submitted some legally binding regulations on personal responsibility."
18304,It is probably a tightening when you have to follow them.
18305,The advice is based on what is in the law and you must follow the law.
18306,It's just that we clarify what applies in terms of legislation.
18307,*Have you considered any other way?
18308,"*

\- You always look at different solutions and discuss how this will work."
18309,Then you should always choose the rule that is least restrictive but has the most effect.
18310,Legislation should never go harder than is necessary.
18311,(more below)
18312,They gave the vaccine to tens of thousands of people and noted the side effects that occurred - they already have tested for side effects.
18313,"“Data demonstrate vaccine was well tolerated across all populations with over 43,000 participants enrolled; no serious safety concerns observed; the only Grade 3 adverse event greater than 2% in frequency was fatigue at 3.8% and headache at 2.0%.” - [from the Pfizer press release](https://www.pfizer.com/news/press-release/press-release-detail/pfizer-and-biontech-conclude-phase-3-study-covid-19-vaccine)."
18314,I hate that I have to upvote this.
18315,I love it that you have a problem with a vaccine - created in around a year after the world discovered a terrible virus and endured a painful pandemic that killed thousands and infected millions - being in short supply immediately upon its approval.
18316,"I mean, they've been manufacturing at risk, and they will certainly ramp up, but your comment is about as

18328,"The questions/answers with journalists (copy from SVT website):

*How do you see that many may leave the big cities during Christmas while we are expected to see the culmination of the spread of infection?"
18329,"*

\- We see that travel is possible if it is contagious."
18330,WE also push to socialize in a smaller circle.
18331,"When you get to your destination, you should socialize in the smaller circle, says Karin Tegmark Wisell, head of the Public Health Agency."
18332,*Have hospitals in other regions prepared?
18333,"*

\- We have had meetings with places that receive many tourists so that it can happen in as safe a way as possible."
18334,"But they also want to open up for travelers, but that you stay in your house and travel home if you become ill and do not burden the care on site, says Bitte Bråstad, General Counsel at the Public Health Agency."
18335,*What does the National Board of Health and Welfare say?
18336,"*

\- It is important that you go home if you get sick, as Bitte says."
18337,"Tourist-dense regions are used to planning for increased travel, there is a plan for houses to handle accidents and other things that can occur when travel increases, says Johanna Sandwall, head of emergency preparedness at the National Board of Health and Welfare."
18338,"\- There is an opportunity for local general advice if any region does not think this works, says Bitte Bråstad, General Counsel at the Public Health Agency."
18339,*When is the culmination (peak) expected?
18340,"*

\- In our scenario based on a forecast, the culmination seems to happen sometime in the middle or end of December."
18341,We do not know exactly how it will turn out.
18342,The culmination may very well occur during the Christmas weekend.
18343,"It looks different in different regions but a serious situation in the country, says Johanna Sandwall, crisis preparedness manager, National Board of Health and Welfare."
18344,*Is this the last peak before a vaccine or can there be more?
18345,"*

\- It is very possible that we can get an additional peaks, it is too early to comment on."
18346,"We have confidence in the vaccinations, but there will be an increasing immunity after which the vaccinations will proceed."
18347,"It is not the case that as soon as vaccinations are started by the most vulnerable, we can deviate from the ways we need to protect the entire population."
18348,"We must follow and see when we can have an effect on the population level, says Karin Tegmark Wisell, head of the Public Health Agency."
18349,*What will be the biggest challenge for national advice to follow?
18350,"*

\- You have to think about it now: personal responsibility has always existed, but now we are putting extra pressure on everyone to think about it and how to protect risk groups."
18351,"To travel safely, not to work in the workplace if you do not have to, remember not to shop the whole family."
18352,"We place a great responsibility on the individual to pull his straw to the pile, says Bitte Bråstad, General Counsel at the Public Health Agency."

18369,Ok here's my question!!
18370,Where are the gloves and the PPE necessary for this vaccination?
18371,I cannot remember the last time a person drew blood from me or gave me a shot without them wearing plastic gloves!!!
18372,I' m in my 60's so that means gloves have been used for a long time.
18373,"Also, if the hospitals are so busy, then why are there so many people there to cheer her getting the first vaccine?"
18374,"If they are hospital personnel then, I'm assuming they have more important things to do than watch and cheer a vaccination."
18375,"Now,  if you want to tell me those are ones with the press doing the clapping, then I also have a concern about that."
18376,How long have these elderly people had to go without seeing family?

18378,I sure hope these elderly people are not being exposed to the outside world!
18379,I wish that this would have been thought through if it was going to be viewed nationally.
18380,There are so many questionable protocols missing and remember this is the especially important for this is the first vaccination given for the first volunteer for Covid-19 Virus which has been responsible for so very much.

18669,I think the first thing americans should do is learn not to trust your news fully.
18670,And to read up on other sources readily available on the internet and learn to form a fair and balanced worldview rather than just regurgitate what Fox news feeds you and follow Trump's tweets.

Not as dumb as the people who keep claiming that the indigenous people of the Americas had a system of slavery similar to the one implemented by the Transatlantic slave trade"
18679,Don't associate us with these shitholes
18680,Seems like all these awards and updoots and comments say otherwise.
18681,"There are absolutely teachers who don’t want to go in, BUT in nearly all situations they have absolutely no say in whether their district is in person."

18683,You are a walking billboard for misinformation.
18684,Holy shit.
18685,"Seriously, step back, think about where you get your information from."
18686,Research and study skepticism.
18687,You blurt out numbers that have no basis in reality.
18688,The reality is the best estimate IFR won’t be known until post pandemic.
18689,You make false claims such as the dying with not from COVID which has been throughly debunked at this point and shows a serious misunderstanding of how morbidity and mortality is estimated.
18690,"Furthermore, you need to ask yourself what type of person you are?"
18691,Are you a person who crumbles under pressure during a crisis?
18692,A crisis in which an individual can affect the outcome positively or narratively but instead latches on to false information to try to push a psychopathic viewpoint.
18693,Just stop.
18694,Think about what you’re doing.
18695,It’s a tough and complicated situation but you are no better than those who want to shut everything done and lock everyone in their homes.

18697,Students should go to College and I'm not against the government subsidseing it but this would be doing it in the compete wrong way.
18698,The government shouldn't give money to private school who have spent irresponsibly to make thiers campuses nicer.
18699,The money should go to public schools

18712,Noone cares.
18713,"This is why covid 19 is such a clusterfuck in the US, people on both sides using it for their own visibility rather than quietly serve the public good."

18715,Definitely higher than that unfortunately.
18716,We will clear 300 this year...
18717,Yeah thats not what im talking about after the collapse when search and recovery began they were told the air was safe
18718,"Lol, legally the USA government can do whatever the fuck they want during a national emergency."
18719,We straight up nationalized defense production during WW2.

18732,"Sounds like she hacked her old department's servers, which is very illegal."
18733,I'd advise not making a martyr out of this woman quite yet.
18734,She's got a history of being extremely dishonest and a con woman.
18735,"Which doesn't mean that DeSantis isn't, too."
18736,A person in government being unethical is probable.
18737,A whole department like FDLE being so is extremely improbable.
18738,Sorry for your lost.
18739,We lost one of ours this year too.
18740,Hard to deal with on top of everything else in 2020.
18741,Blame congress.
18742,DOD and VA are separate agencies with separate budgets that are made by congress.
18743,So pentagon isn't really responsible for taking care of vets.
18744,"&gt;[M]embers of labor unions, and unorganized unskilled workers, will sooner or later realize that their government is not even trying to prevent wages from sinking or to prevent jobs from being exported."
18745,"Around the same time, they will realize that suburban white-collar workers—themselves desperately afraid of being downsized—are not going to let themselves be taxed to provide social benefits for anyone else."
18746,"&gt;At that point, something will crack."
18747,"The nonsuburban electorate will decide that the system has failed and start looking for a strongman to vote for — someone willing to assure them that, once he is elected, the smug bureaucrats, tricky lawyers, overpaid bond salesmen, and postmodernist professors will no longer be calling the shots."
18748,A scenario like that of Sinclair Lewis' novel *It Can't Happen Here* may then be played out.
18749,"For once such a strongman takes office, nobody can predict what will happen."
18750,"In 1932, most of the predictions made about what would happen if Hindenburg named Hitler chancellor were wildly overoptimistic."
18751,"&gt;One thing that is very likely to happen is that the gains made in the past 40 years by black and brown Americans, and by homosexuals, will be wiped out."
18752,Jocular contempt for women will come back into fashion.

18797,Its blowing up.
18798,What's China's data got to do with a thread about Taiwan.
18799,"Yeah, that site is down but it's still up in several websites (I had to Google it cuz OPs post isn't working)"

18808,Especially not in a nursing home.
18809,Or 0.08% of the us population ?
18810,Significant
18811,I'm hearing April before the US has enough vaccine produced to give one to anyone who wants it.
18812,"Even if Pfizer et al allocated 100% of their US production capacity to US orders until that point (which I don't think will be the case, but that's a guess), it's not going to take long after that for there to be enough vaccines to cover anyone in Canada who wants one."
18813,"I'm not sure whether that accounts for more than Pfizer and Moderna, but it's worth noting that just Pfizer and Moderna alone will have enough vaccines to vaccinate 20 million Americans by the end of December and there are many more vaccines in late stage trials."
18814,Same.
18815,"When my hours were cut back (WFH) I drank much more, then they were increased and cut back."
18816,"Now they're back down, my drinking went up for a week but brought it back down quickly this time."

18818,"Many on there are stopping permanently, but just to have a dry spell I still find lurking there very helpful."
18819,Because of Thanksgiving?
18820,The insidious thing about Covid-19 is that it has an incubation period before any symptoms show.
18821,Plus there are all those folks who are asymptomatic.
18822,It's publically available data that they are volunteering their own time to organize and present a truthful look into how covid is affecting Florida without trying to spin the numbers to look more positive like the attests was trying to make her do.
18823,It just normally takes a state to pay people to do this since there is no real financial incentive to do it privately.
18824,A lot of places were forced to change how they reported data months ago so now it's much harder to aggregate everything efficiency without a lot of manual work.
18825,restaurants were barbaric even before a pandemic.

18829,That is correct.

18832,And no one is saying we should adopt their model of lying about it.
18833,"But even as they lied about it, they still did real measures to contain the spread."

18835,They're not all or nothing.
18836,"Everyone should make backups, one backup onsite, one backup off site (id ""the cloud"" or some other physical location.)"
18837,"If you're pissing off corrupt Republicans, particularly ones in state and/or local government who can illegally push corrupt local police to ""raid"" you, it's that much more important that you have backups."
18838,The percentage to reach herd immunity is debated by epidemiologists.
18839,Is your younger cousin named err?
18840,Cowards pointed guns at her kids too.
18841,I've come to the conclusion that a solid portion of this country cares more about money/property than they do life.
18842,"It's why 9/11 got a strong response from them, they destroyed a landmark."
18843,It's also why they stay quiet on police murdering people and then get outraged when they break property in response to murder.

18852,So it looks like the Trump administration actually passed on ordering more of the Pfizer vaccine in summer.

18886,You will see scientists slowly drift away and go work on whatever pays the bills instead of working on MRNA vaccines.
18887,The only way around this is to fund vaccine research with tax money via a government.
18888,"But even then, the government will still need to pay market rate to grab talent from private industry, especially for cutting edge research like MRNA vaccines."
18889,"Even when you involve a state government, that doesn't guarantee they'll share the whatever vaccine/medicine globally."
18890,The US doesn't share its taxpayer-funded military research either.
18891,Depends on article you read.

18948,"He got healthier and better able to move around after he went to the home because he was swimming and doing some exercise everyday, and enjoyed the socialization he didn't get as much of since his wife died (my father was his closest relative)."
18949,"But a difference is that I don't think veteran homes are trying to profit off of care of the elderly, and they probably pay better than the private nursing homes."

18955,"And what do you know, most people aren't self-quarantining, who would've thunk?"
18956,"We've already seen time and time again that appealing to people's goodwill doesn't work, because even if half the population is willing to play ball, the other leaking half is still a huge number of people going out and mingling and essentially completely negating the containment policy."
18957,"If you, a random person unrelated to this situation, is already thinking about making excuses for not following the clearly spelled out guidelines and consequences applicable to every inbound traveler to Taiwan, I guarantee you that this has passed through the minds of many people who have entered Taiwan over the past few months."
18958,"If every one of those people took it upon themselves to justify breaking quarantine (""oh, it's just a few seconds"", ""oh, I just needed to take a walk for a few minutes""), you will rapidly add to the number of transmission vectors that will quickly spiral out of the health authority's ability to contain."

19266,"&gt;LONDON (AP) — A retired British shop clerk received the first shot in the country’s COVID-19 vaccination program Tuesday, the start of an unprecedented global immunization effort intended to offer a route out of a pandemic that has killed 1.5 million."
19267,"&gt;Margaret Keenan, who turns 91 next week, got the shot at 6:31 a.m. on what public health officials have dubbed “V-Day.” She was first in line at University Hospital Coventry, one of several hospitals around the country that are handling the initial phase of the United Kingdom’s program."
19268,"As luck would have it, the second injection went to a man named William Shakespeare, an 81-year-old who hails from Warwickshire, the county where the bard was born."
19269,&gt;The U.K. is the first Western country to start a mass vaccination program after British regulators last week authorized the use of a COVID-19 shot developed by U.S. drugmaker Pfizer and Germany’s BioNTech.
19270,"U.S. and European Union regulators may approve the vaccine in the coming days or weeks, fueling a global immunization effort."
19271,"&gt;Britain has received 800,000 doses of the Pfizer vaccine, enough to vaccinate 400,000 people."
19272,"The first shots will go to people over 80 who are either hospitalized or already have outpatient appointments scheduled, along with nursing home workers and vaccination staff."
19273,Others will have to wait their turn.
19274,"&gt;The vaccine, however, remains experimental."
19275,"While it seems to prevent people from getting sick, it is still unclear how long that protection lasts."
19276,"&gt;The 800,000 doses Britain has received so far are only a fraction of what is needed."
19277,"The government is targeting more than 25 million people, or about 40% of the population, in the first phase of its vaccination program, which gives first priority to those who are highest risk from the disease."

19293,When you have lots of money you can do everything unconditionally and in parallel.
19294,That makes all the difference.
19295,Where are the people here who say China's vaccine is safe?

19301,Hell yeah.
19302,Will that make someone's life better?
19303,Probably.
19304,My therapist had me make a list of what triggers anxiety and what my biggest fears are.

19316,We are going to have plenty of vaccine.
19317,"The Pfizer doses we passed on go to some of our closest allies, and we need to get the vaccine distributed worldwide to get a handle on the pandemic."
19318,Moderna and J&amp;J doses will come as well.
19319,No need for America to hog up all the Pfizer doses.

19323,I’m doing this as well.
19324,No.
19325,Oxford has some - but only some participants doing weekly infection tests.
19326,Most only got tested after showing covid symptoms.
19327,"I would be interesting to see the data of the weekly tests, but I would expect that it isn't enough data to be statistically significant (but it would be enough to say if more study was worth doing!)"

19335,Lol what???
19336,"No one is mandating that I shut down my business, not see my family, or deprive myself of the ability to breath fresh air because of the flu."
19337,Is there past evidence of long term damage caused by vaccines?
19338,"I think that is something many people are concerned about as there’s no way to know what effects could arise in a number of years, considering the trials started less than a yet ago."
19339,"Unlike the flu vaccine, where it’s been tried and proven for nearly a hundred years."
19340,Thanks!
19341,A good portion of the US are anti-COVID-vax people.
19342,Think of all the anti-maskers......many of them will not be seeking vaccination day 1.

19348,Where I'm at it's super subjective.
19349,A few healthcare systems are systematically testing workers--mine just offered it's second round of free antibody tests and if you are symptomatic they test you through their own employee health system w/ results within 24h.
19350,"BUT other systems are making employees seek testing through their personal providers (and at their own expense), with turn around times getting close to a week now."
19351,It's nuts.
19352,Well.. STI’s if one of ya cheating

19358,Nicely done dude.
19359,I actually had a really bad hangover a couple of years ago: 3 days of borderline suicidal anxiety after 1 night of drinking white wine.
19360,I quit for a year completely (that hangover was nowhere near worth it for the up).
19361,"I've since established it is indeed specifically white wine that even a couple of glasses just gives me days of anxiety and dread, but I've spent most of the time since 2017 not really drinking ever, and it has made the dreaded B word about to happen here in the UK and a certain bloviating loudmouth across the pond far easier to navigate mentally."
19362,And this whole year has been easier for me to cope with sober.
19363,So well done dude.
19364,How long has it been?
19365,"Prices go up, salaries go down."
19366,Debts are inflated away.
19367,The powerful are being so well taken care of.
19368,Vaccinate everyone.
19369,Destroy the virus.
19370,Days?
19371,It felt like I had multiple broken ribs for 3 weeks.
19372,Then I’d cough and it felt like I’d been kicked in the chest on my broken ribs.
19373,I’d roll over in my sleep and wake up in pain.
19374,It hurt to breathe for 2.5 months after the worst of it.
19375,I went from rock climbing 2-3x/week for 1.5-2 hours each time to struggling to walk 1/2 a block in 30 minutes.
19376,Oh that should take about 5 minutes...
19377,In Sweden there is not even a recommendation for use on public transport.
19378,My country is so fucking stupid
19379,"The thing is that masks, believe it or not, wearing masks is not the only thing that can be done to protect yourself and others."
19380,There are actually much more effective means like social distancing or self-isolation when having symptoms.
19381,"If your family maintains social distance, a mask won't make any difference"

19402,It isn’t as simple as “of course they should close!” Is the government providing financial relief for the restaurants?
19403,Because I understand their frustration if they are being asked to lose a massive chunk of their revenue without any aid by the people that are forcing them to close.
19404,Business owners need money too in order to support themselves and their family.
19405,What about the employees?
19406,They are also out of money if the government doesn’t step in and help.

19424,"We’re getting Moderna next week and then J&amp;J, AstraZeneca, and Novavax in Q1 of 2021."
19425,Guess this is where the percent positive starts to go way up again
19426,"To be fair, the US made a number of mistakes, but declining to buy more Pfizer wasn't necessarily one of them."
19427,It was not known at that point that Pfizer was going to be the first to pass Phase 3 and be so effective.

19455,The data offer the world’s first detailed look at the evidence behind the shots.
19456,"The vaccine worked well regardless of a volunteer’s race, weight or age, the data showed."

19458,You're likely right.

19460,Health authorities are going to err on the side of caution.
19461,"Another factor to consider is some, maybe none, of various vaccines have been fully tested on children yet."

Trump administration officials passed when Pfizer offered in late summer to sell the U.S. government additional doses of its Covid-19 vaccine, according to people familiar with the matter."
19669,"**Now Pfizer may not be able provide more of its vaccine to the United States until next June because of its commitments to other countries, they said**."
19670,"As the administration scrambles to try to purchase more doses of the vaccine, President Trump plans on Tuesday to sign an executive order “to ensure that United States government prioritizes getting the vaccine to American citizens before sending it to other nations,” according to a draft statement and a White House official, though it was not immediately clear what force the president’s executive order would carry."
19671,That included whether it would expand the U.S. supply of doses beyond what is spelled out in existing federal contracts.
19672,"The vaccine being produced by Pfizer and its German partner, BioNTech, is a two-dose treatment, meaning that 100 million doses is enough to vaccinate only 50 million Americans."
19673,"The vaccine is expected to receive authorization for emergency use in the U.S. as soon as this weekend, with another vaccine, developed by Moderna, also likely to be approved for emergency use soon."
19674,"Britain plans to begin a vaccination drive on Tuesday using the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine, making it the first Western nation to start mass vaccinations."
19675,"On Nov. 11 — two days after Pfizer first announced early results indicating that its vaccine was more than 90 percent effective — the European Union announced that it had finalized a supply deal with Pfizer and BioNTech for 200 million doses, a deal they began negotiating in months earlier."
19676,"Shipments could begin by the end of the year, and the contract includes an option for 100 million more doses."
19677,"Asked if the Trump administration had missed a crucial chance over the summer to snap up more doses for Americans, a spokeswoman for the Department of Health and Human Services said, “We are confident that we will have 100 million doses of Pfizer’s vaccine as agreed to in our contract, and beyond that, we have five other vaccine candidates.”."
19678,"In a statement, Pfizer said that “any additional doses beyond the 100 million are subject to a separate and mutually acceptable agreement,” and that “the company is not able to comment on any confidential discussions that may be taking place with the U.S. government.”."

20520,I am just sharing my example of how police failing to show up to write their report can effect someone.
20521,Now imagine if it was a high value item and insurance is asking for a report.
20522,I have experienced vastly different levels of wealth in my relatively short life.
20523,If I had lived in a better neighborhood when my ID was stolen I am pretty sure I would have received any report promptly.
20524,"Yeah, almost like they can ignore their lame duck boss because competent new management is coming in soon."
20525,SUE.
20526,So what exactly were the officials on video using a welder doing?
20527,"I duno about you, but all my friends haven't lost their jobs and we haven't done shit all year."
20528,We have money to spend.
20529,Might as well go big on Christmas.
20530,there is literally nothing else to do besides buy shit and sit at home.
20531,God damn 2020 sucks.
20532,We had interstate rivalry in a good way which was every state and territory trying to get cases to zero and keep them there.
20533,Whatever is going on in the US ... is not that.
20534,&gt; People lose their jobs and livelihoods for being mean to a customer.
20535,And that is also fucked up.
20536,This whole country is fucked up.
20537,"If we have some support from our leaders and some financial relief, 200,000 less people might have died."
20538,"Blame the leaders, not people trying to live their lives in a bullshit, cutthroat world."
20539,"Vaccines are extraordinarily complex things to produce, and this is the first time anyone’s actually made mRNA vaccines for real clinical use, at all."
20540,"They’re scaling up breathtakingly fast; it hasn’t even been approved yet, and Pfizer is planning on producing over a billion doses next year."
20541,It’s actually pretty impressive.
20542,"And we’ve got not just another company or two doing the same thing, but more like six or seven."
20543,There’s a decent chance we’ll be able to vaccinate most of the world in 2021.
20544,"Rules for thee, but not for me obv"
20545,[removed]
20546,Nah.
20547,The pandemic is socially ending by the summer regardless of how available the vaccines are.
20548,Wearing masks everywhere and having gatherings over Zoom is not a sustainable lifestyle.
20549,"That's a fake lockdown however (schools are open, streets are full)."
20550,Which is all very well if it works.
20551,The main effect is that restaurants are closed.
20552,Well paid people are less likely to do this.
20553,"Not justifying their actions, but theft is pretty easily predicted here."
20554,The system is creating this situation where theft is likely and we're not correcting it.
20555,Any low Income worker theft is predicted that be higher.
20556,CNAs work their assess off and don't make a living wage.
20557,"They're wiping butts, vaginas, changing diapers, cleaning soiled beds, showering patients, getting bit, getting spat on, and get paid like $12-14 an hour."
20558,They're on their feet almost all day.
20559,There were days the only time I sat down was to use the restroom.
20560,And now with covid and having crazy PPE mandates with little supplies...it's not ideal.
20561,Again THEFT IS WRONG.
20562,these people are under paid.
20563,"If they were paid more the quality of care would likely rise as more people would do the job, you could kick out the baddies easier by having a better pool of candidates, and people making more money would be less likely to steal."
20564,80% of Americans were already living paycheck to paycheck before the pandemic.
20565,Imagine what that’s gonna be now.
20566,60% living in abject poverty at least.
20567,But society won’t break down?
20568,"Not for 40% of the country’s 65% white population, sure."
20569,"Pfizer has vaccine production plants in Maine, Michigan, Missouri and one in Belgium."
20570,"I’m not sure what the anticipated executive order will say, but it’s completely within his power to use the Defense Production Act to force Pfizer to continue making the vaccine at the 3 US plants, and not ship any doses abroad till every US citizen who wants one, gets one."
20571,"This would likely set of a international incident considering Canada, Britain and the EU have already signed and paid for Pfizer vaccine that will be produced in the US."
20572,There’s a valid argument on both sides for the ethics of using the Defense Production Act including the idea that a Pfizer worker in Missouri that is making the vaccine is told he can’t receive said vaccine.
20573,"On the other side, the US had the option to pre-order more doses, but chose not to (a genuinely difficult decision) so others stepped in to buy."
20574,"TLDR: It doesn’t matter how many doses the Trump administration purchased, because they have the power to essentially confiscate all doses made in the US including any supplies purchased by other countries via the Defense Production Act."
20575,4?
20576,try 20.
20577,"Even some of the people who voted for him aren't like that, roughly 50-60% of them are but certainly not everyone (I have a relative who voted for him and he's not like that)."
20578,Some of them voted for him because his policies helped them get a decent job after years of being unemployed (mainly those who live in rural areas) or because they're very conservative/against abortion/dislike other liberal policies.
20579,I once delivered to a nursing home.
20580,It was like 1:30 am.
20581,"The building was completely silent.... until I got off the elevator on the second floor, at which point I could clearly hear this trashy staffer screaming at her boyfriend on the phone at top volume from the other side of the building."
20582,Real nice 👌
20583,&gt; People do wear masks.
20584,"If you look at that video, specifically the people who don’t wear masks all had a drink in their hand."
20585,"Yes, because mask off with drink in hand has exactly the same effect."
20586,No kidding !
20587,And it’s one freaking time.
20588,One year.
20589,Handle it people!
20590,"I mean I guess if you are celebrating other first world countries like Canada, Australia/NZ etc then yeah."
20591,"But I don’t think anyone in the US and Europe will be too envious of lower official numbers in second and third world territories like Central America, Asia and Africa considering the overall quality of life there."
20592,"Even with the virus and all the issues it’s bringing, they’re still 10x above standards of living in those regions."
20593,I struggled with the remote classes I took as a university student.
20594,Remote learning sucks.
20595,"I have not lost job, and my wife only briefly for two months."
20596,"We are not spending anything that we used like transportation, dry cleaners, etc."
20597,"We did before Covid quite a lot of travel, but we just stayed at home or camped in the mountains to avoid crowds."
20598,We did a major reconstruction that we were planning anyway.
20599,But I do consider my situation lucky.
20600,I know quite a few people who struggle due a job loss or were long quite a for a while sick with the virus.
20601,"People who cut their expenses due the Covid, the saving rate did get a nice boost."
20602,Still I will consider this year as really bad one.
20603,"Staying out of the way, for lack of a better way to put it, DOES help."
20604,"You can't help what other people do if they choose to ignore the risks and go to Christmas parties, but the very act of keeping yourself and your family out of that helps - you're keeping yourselves out of needing medical care and you're preventing the possibility of catching it and passing it onto other people."
20605,"That counts, a lot."
20606,Things would be even worse if no one was isolating or taking precautions.
20607,But that confusion is exactly what Trump is aiming for.
20608,"The reality is, as you said, the order is simply about not donating vaccines we receive, not about expecting to receive more than we ordered."
20609,BUT the optics behind the order are very different.
20610,"This is Trump's narrative:

1."
20611,"Trump has handled the pandemic better than any other US president would have, and better than any other country did."
20612,2.
20613,"We only have these vaccines now because of Trump's Operation Warp Speed, and if anyone else were president, it would have taken 5 years for the world to have vaccines (he said this verbatim at a rally over the weekend)."
20614,"Meanwhile, it's been reported that Trump is furious that the UK approved the vaccines before the FDA."
20615,"Which makes sense: if Trump is leading the way and is responsible for the success of the vaccines, how could another country get them first?"
20616,"It is in this context that Trump wants to be perceived as America First'ing the vaccines, because they're HIS vaccines, as he sees it."
20617,"He will tout this order as being about exercising full control over HIS vaccines by keeping it for Americans first, even though as you said that's not actually what this order does."
20618,"Trump doesn't care, it's all about the optics to him."
20619,I think there is no reason to overthink it.
20620,"If it seems interesting, post it (unless it's highly technical in which case /r/covid19 is there)."
20621,"If you are a denier, you might find some resistance."
20622,It all depends on your motive.
20623,Fish overcooked?
20624,"Believe it or not, jail...."
20625,Receipts for the audience?
20626,"Olivemor’s evidence is being responsible and not having children cause death, the kids can swing back later to learn things and not kill people, what don’t you understand about that?"
20627,Let's make sure we deal in facts and hard numbers.
20628,Plenty of people = [2% of people](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1jP9NkpSrTJh0QKylXmTsK_864omtmhYh-zNnirnCfWM/edit?fbclid=IwAR1WAIT2yDNs3lMMHoaK5CUNo6XL8QpitfWLW_XAhvGeuhL8rS1KKZkcQR8#heading=h.ox61rycloyhr).
20629,You can’t force folks to work under those conditions.
20630,It’s so infuriating that the caretakers wouldn’t have some common sense and stay the fuck away from a wedding like this.
20631,I hope the deaths of their patients weighs heavy on their heads.
20632,So many anecdotes.
20633,How do your friends know they were the ones who infected their other relatives who died?
20634,My mom is also an ICU nurse in her 60s who has also been working crazy over time to help out.
20635,I hate that she is still working but I admire her so much and think she is a total badass.
20636,I hope your badass mom stays safe and healthy
20637,Just wait until the years after this.
20638,60% of the US population will take a generation to climb out of abject lower second world poverty with the financial and economic toll of this thing.
20639,Being brave enough to run into burning buildings too.
20640,No one can diminish  York firefighters and their heroism on 9/11.
20641,The firefighter funerals went on every day for months.
20642,"It wasn’t just FDNY, people poured in from everywhere to help."
20643,I’m in favor of letting them make up their own minds.
20644,"I freaked out on my mom earlier today for just this reason....""Just live your life,"" she said, ""you can't let covid control you."""
20645,After she and my dad fucking gave me covid literally 3 weeks ago.
20646,"Yeah I know, but 2021 is right around the corner."
20647,"No Christmas in the family this year, but who knows maybe in 2021?"
20648,It's not about conformity.
20649,It's not making non-conformity a cult doctrine.
20650,You really should just conform when you really don't have any reason not to.
20651,Maybe because it’s only speculation.... read the first sentence.
20652,Remind me 28 years!
20653,It was confirmed yesterday that she will be receiving the vaccine very soon
20654,"To vaccinate everyone by summer, it'll need to be more like 1-2 million individuals per week, so 2+ million doses, depending on the vaccine used."
20655,Thanks Vietnam!
20656,This is a realyl good suggestion and we really need a day like this.
20657,I bet they assumed that 100 yrs ago
20658,That fucker came back from death just to get the shot!
20659,!
20660,It got you a vaccine over a month early.
20661,Brexit quite literally saved thousands of lives
20662,"Like comic con, but instead of Batman and Iron Man, we have vaccines and Trump and instead of getting inside the event hall by purchasing tickets, you get inside by being a member of the Republican Party."
20663,are super computers getting worse every year?
20664,what makes you think tech advancement will slow down next time?
20665,this is a really weird slippery slope argument to make
20666,&gt;vaccinating people equally at risk but younger.
20667,They don't really exist.
20668,Age is by far the single biggest predictive factor of risk.
20669,So is the EU.
20670,Both representatives of both the EU and US called the UK's approval 'irresponsible' (read in to that whatever you will).
20671,The EU have confirmed for certain in the last couple of days that there will be no vaccinations in 2020
20672,Who wants to remember?
20673,I dont need a reminder.
20674,I got it.
20675,Believe me so am I brother but I’m going to hold on until everyone who wants a shot gets a shot.
20676,The rest of the world is watching.
20677,Probably just the ones with millions of deaths and a readily available vaccine
20678,Whatchu got against the waho.
20679,I will also say that the city i work for is providing A LOT of assistance.
20680,"Rental assistance programs for all, various income programs for targeted sectors of employees and businesses."
20681,I see it because I work in contracts.
20682,The 1918 Spanish Flu overwhelmingly killed healthy young people the most.
20683,"So if the next pandemic is like that one, will you be as willing to be in lockdown while the rest of us carry on as normal?"
20684,"At 456 years old, he's very much in the high-risk group."
20685,The EU have confirmed that no vaccines will be given in 2020
20686,Don’t have cuts on your hands/wear gloves do not touch eyes etc and sanitize your groceries while masked up especially if you have to go face to face and cannot get deliveries.
20687,What I’ve been doing this entire time and probably won’t ever stop because people are gross in general even without a pandemic.
20688,"It is not ""just one year"" as you put it, but rather ""two weeks to flatten the curve"", then ""two weeks to protect hospitals"", then ""two weeks because blablabla"" then ""until the vaccine comes"" and now ""oh sorry, the vaccine might not be enough""."
20689,"You seem to speak from a very comfortable position, from which one year seems to pass fast enough."
20690,Perhaps for other people in worse financial and mental situations this year was a bit harder?
20691,I am really sick of this entire situation and of patronising people like you
20692,Is an egg hardboiled the instant you put it in the boiling water?
20693,Not sure why the US is being picked on here.
20694,All countries have thus issue with media.
20695,It’s like one extreme or the other.
20696,"And if I share this news on FB, all my anti-vax friends will rip off the anti-mask masks."
20697,"They are fully convinced the pandemic is a globalist plot that the GOP is fighting against, and there is no way they will get vaccinated."
20698,Lol got it.
20699,"You middle aged man, you."
20700,I see your points but I still diagree.
20701,Unemployment is at its highest ever.
20702,A couple members of my family are unemployed because of covid.
20703,2/4.
20704,And my view might be crazy but I feel like people DID learn from 1918.
20705,The wrong people.
20706,The people with power who learned they could use this to restructure the economy.
20707,"See, your first mistake was assuming they care about people."
20708,"This is all about the money, hence the ""race for the vaccine""."
20709,First company to get a working vaccine is gonna cash in
20710,"I don’t think they’re vaccinating 2 million in that time, but they will have the vaccines available to do so."
20711,The r/China_Flu one?
20712,not going to get any better for 2 months and how worse its going to get is well off the charts.
20713,Historic period of American FAILURE
20714,All I’m saying is like every zombie video game starts this way
20715,"The death of one is a tragedy, but the death of  millions is a statistic"
20716,Back before the great sub migration.
20717,Early into this I heard a bit a commentary that resonated with me.
20718,"It was something along the lines of, a death is tragic, but thousands are just a statistic."
20719,"That’s definitely where a large part of the country is at, unless it’s hit and killed someone within a degree or two at most of their personal circle."
20720,"In some China schools, Muslin students are complained by other students that they have some privilege."
20721," I Think everyone expected to be regionalised much like SARS and MERS or be lesser extent like Swine Flu &amp; Ebola, because that the recent history we had to go on."
20722,We weren’t expecting Spanish Flu version two.
20723,Can anyone knowledgeable explain the significance of the Pfizer drug not having been put through interaction testing?
20724,This means (as I understand it) that there's no data to show wether it'll do anything freaky if it comes into contact with other medications in the host's body.
20725,"[https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment\_data/file/940565/Information\_for\_Healthcare\_Professionals\_on\_Pfizer\_BioNTech\_COVID-19\_vaccine.pdf](https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/940565/Information_for_Healthcare_Professionals_on_Pfizer_BioNTech_COVID-19_vaccine.pdf)

Are the risks negligible due to the vaccine being similar to existing drugs?"
20726,"According to [Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-12-08/sinovac-says-97-rate-is-seroconversion-rate-in-indonesia-trial) Sinovac has said that number is not efficacy, it is seroconversion rate."
20727,I highly doubt that an inactived vaccine has that rate of efficacy.
20728,Ummm...
20729,"Unless these grocery stores are all within walking distance, you're probably spending the difference in gas."
20730,"Oh shit, google translation is messing up things again."
20731,Thanks for pointing that up.
20732,I’m a teacher.
20733,I would love this in the future.
20734,"My
 state is entertaining the idea"
20735,"So, he was not longer working for them after he said it, huh?"
20736,They conclude this because no one's testing kids.
20737,"It's comically absurd to believe there's some ""special"" thing about children keeping them from spreading a virus every human can get."
20738,The reality is the kids are statistically likely to not have severe cases.
20739,But they're still getting it and transmitting it.
20740,"But not only do parents fear their own nasal swab, they've decided kids getting one would be too ""scarring"" mentally."
20741,The nurses have told us multiple times they won't even test the kids if there's no symptoms.
20742,"Well statistically, they won't have symptoms."
20743,[removed]
20744,Do they all live in the same house?
20745,?
20746,You also have to take into account that those numbers coming out of the countries aren’t going to ever be able to accurately report all deaths and cases because simply the infrastructure isn’t there to confirm the cases or sometimes even for the govt to be notified- especially in rural areas.
20747,Stop acting like more than a few areas have hospitals at capacity.
20748,The majority of the country still has beds so you’re point is moot- an average American is much more likely to get quality care here than in a developing country- it’s unbelievable you are even trying to argue that point.
20749,"There was a quote from a minister is a smaller country is Africa, who was the last country to ever report a case, a journalist asked how they hadn’t had any infections yet and he minister replied “it’s easy- you don’t find any cases of you aren’t testing haha”."
20750,Not that they didn’t want to test- it’s that not only did they not have access to tests but they didn’t have the resources to effectively deploy them across the rural country.
20751,*Look.
20752,I get the anti American sentiment and the fact of the matter is we botched this pandemic.
20753,"However- your claims simply aren’t backed up by facts or data, the issue is very nuanced yet you feel compelled to oversimplify it to your own detriment."
20754,Gov Ron DeathSentence cracking down on the truth...

20760,70% need to get infected for herd immunity.
20761,It'll be interesting to see which number gets there first.
20762,He should probably just discourage gatherings first then say to try to limit it to less than 10 people.
20763,They say get over it but bring up shit that happened 400 years ago
20764,As long as the over 60s are vaccinated it's pretty much pandemic over at that point if it's as effective at preventing serious illness as claimed.
20765,Just make sure you don't see the wrong Ghostbusters.
20766,"&gt; Currently being offered to over 80s, health and care staff

Yeah, I expected it to go to those most at risk."

20769,Damn this gonna be the fall of US just like Chernobyl helping ussr embark on a downfall
20770,"&gt;at least it’s bringing people to the lord

Is this about bringing people to church or about killing them?"
20771,Cause I can never tell
20772,The secret no one's discussing is the grades aren't improving for in person either.
20773,When they're back they're not suddenly doing homework.
20774,They've simply stopped caring and their parents are too busy/stressed to worry about pushing them.
20775,The right answer is online and hope for the best.
20776,A child who falls behind a year can still one day catch up on content.
20777,A child who's parent dies from Covid will now struggle for decades to even put a life together let alone read Lord of the Flies.
20778,Variety.
20779,"I don't eat at restaurants often because I cook, but it you're not going to be able to compete with thousands of different chefs."
20780,You'll certainly find some meals that are really good and different from what you would make at home (which of course gives you input on new ideas for cooking).
20781,This is fuckin stupid.
20782,What about my family of 12 people.
20783,I guess lil Jonny and great gramma can open presents outside
20784,Don't give those militia nuts there any more targets.
20785,I was gonna say this issue was definitely something I noticed in the U.K.
20786,In April when we had like 1100 people a day dying (imagine 5500 deaths in one day in the US) the news were running puff pieces on old people baking bread.
20787,"A month before they were showing Italian hospitals in a state of collapse, Spanish nurses using old plastic bags as PPE, Chinese hospitals with bodies in the corridors, then when it came here?"
20788,Nothing.
20789,Dry statistics and feel good pieces...
20790,See it more like a testrun for the queen and her husband
20791,Surprised you wasted that much time already!
20792,"Though this thread gave me a great laugh to start the day, so thanks for sticking with it I guess :)"
20793,They bought the pfizer vaccine on wish
20794,It is fairly scalable.
20795,Any first world nation should have the infrastructure to vaccinate most of the population using it.
20796,"Most of the hurdles are regulatory, splitting consignments etc."
20797,"Yes the temperature thing complicates matters, but it's on a comparative scale to mass testing which we're starting to roll out quite well."
20798,"I'm, no."
20799,That's not how things work.

20819,"If you didn't catch the virus/have known people who've been seriously ill with it, nor owned a business, it is less visible to you than - for example - a plane crashing into a famous building."
20820,"People take notice of what directly affects them, and rather quickly forget about what doesn't."
20821,"The drug war for instance, kills a shit ton of people every year, and that goes basically ignored by everyone it does not directly affect."
20822,The original post was about the lack of memorialising the 1918 pandemic; I do think that the same thing is going to be happen here.
20823,"YOU compared 9/11 to Covid, I was using your point."
20824,"I'm not comparing the death toll, I'm comparing the visuals."
20825,"I got that you're NOW middle age; I was objecting (light-heartedly) to being called middle age, because you said that that's the age of the folks that remember it."
20826,That's all.
20827,"Many dishes require specific skills, traditional knowledge, and/or particular tools or setups (even something as commonplace as pizza calls for a wood-fired oven, which is kind of a massive pain to have in an average home)... Additionally, innovative cuisine requires creativity, taste and experience, as well as lots of trial and error, to develop new dishes."
20828,"Also, really good restaurants nowadays rely on high-quality, exotic OR super-local and really fresh ingredients, with supply chains that do not involve supermarkets."
20829,"Basically, to match the experience of eating at a different really good restaurant (nothing super fancy) a couple times a month you need truly massive investments in your setups, full-time-job levels of learning and practice, and intimate knowledge of local markets and food importers, plus of course some natural ability and taste."
20830,It is still an undertaking of a significant order to approve and organise the distribution of the vaccine so widely so quickly and we should be proud of that.
20831,"Not to hold over other countries heads, but simply for ourselves."
20832,I think a little national pride once this is all over would do a lot to heal the tensions created by covid and brexit.
20833,"If we can beat it now quickly and effectively with help from all the companies and countries developing the vaccine, we will have a lot to be happy about."
20834,I-O!
20835,"If they like what we’ve done they’ll have to agree with strict quarantine with your phone tracked, wearing masks in all indoor public areas and public transport, isolation for 14 days if in contact with a positive case regardless of your own test results; and back in March/April we banned indoor gatherings of over a 100 people."
20836,"There are things that have to be done, and look like overreacting at times, to avoid lockdowns."
20837,"That’s not to say we’ll never lock down; we would if certain criteria are met, the measures are in place, we’re just not there yet."
20838,America is number one.
20839,Why are we not first?
20840,"What vaccine is being distributed to the millions of Chinese people, and when did THAT process start?"
20841,Is USA medicine kinda lagging?
20842,🤔🧐
20843,Vaccines manufactured in Belgium have been shipped to UK and USA.
20844,Even China and Russia are delivering their vaccine to other countrues.
20845,"Do not expect ""every"" other country to pull out that move."
20846,"Erin O’Toole doesn’t have what it takes to keep motherfucking Derek Sloan (a nobody) in check, yet he wants to be prime minister?"
20847,"It's nice that they clarified ahead of time that all staff working in hospital, clinic, or emergency response settings will be included."

20857,I dont think I ever saw any Swede defending all aspects of the Swedish approach.
20858,I am very critical aswell.
20859,"However, most articles posted here including this one is just pure missinformation."
20860,"The problem with that is that it affects large parts of the world, not just Sweden."
20861,"Sweden is used as a political tool by some people saying that ""Sweden did better than a lot of countries even though they didnt do anything""."
20862,Sweden did a lot and that missinformation is really dangerous.
20863,(They should have done more though i believe.)
20864,No.
20865,In any manner it chooses.
20866,I started fostering during the pandemic and lost what little faith I had left in humanity.
20867,Got to meet some awesome dogs though.
20868,Meanwhile people get arrested for having 10 people over for thanksgiving.
20869,In my defense they did have a Biden sign in their yard so they should be following the protocols they voted for
20870,This explains why the EU approval process for Pfizer is taking another 3 weeks.
20871,No point approving it if you don’t have the vaccines.
20872,Wish they’d just say that instead of trying to cover their ass by claiming it’s about safety.

20889,The slums have 75%+ antibodies.
20890,Did everyone die or got to the ICU?
20891,No.
20892,"You realize many people for a variety of reasons won’t be able to get vaccinated (pregnant woman, infants, children, people with certain illnesses)."
20893,Like I said stuff will come back but it’s not going to be a light switch.

20898,the dumbest funding government ever...

20907,What?
20908,A million per week?
20909,"That is absolute massive, the fuck."
20910,I don’t understand people.
20911,"My family had a get together (I did not attend because, you know, the pandemic), and my mom promised me she’d wear a mask the entire time and ask others to as well."
20912,"She sent me pictures from the gathering, and nobody was wearing a mask!"
20913,She said they had gotten tired of wearing them for so long and had taken them off after a while.
20914,She said it was fine because they’d had them on for a lot of the time.
20915,Does she not know how masks work?
20916,Does she not realize that its protection goes away once you remove it?
20917,noodles yer 48
20918,what data?
20919,the government isn't posting the correct numbers?
20920,nothing republicans are more afraid of than the truth.
20921,Most likely the US will not be completely vaccinated until late next year or maybe early 2022
20922,How dare you!
20923,America is looking like China here.
20924,Who says that?
20925,Is there anything they actually have as justification?
20926,This seems like far beyond a first amendment violation
20927,Wow.
20928,This lady is awesome.
20929,Whoever ordered her arrest is a moron.
20930,Are they really stupid enough to press charges?
20931,Won't the data they took be Exhibit A?
20932,If they are trying to hide their culpability this is not a good approach.
20933,"I live in NYC and there has been anti-mask protests, these loonies have been burning masks and it really hurts my head."
20934,My mom worked as nurse most of her life and  went on disability once the pandemic hit because she has underlying health issues and the thought of selfish pricks putting  healthcare workers lives at risk really pisses me off.
20935,"I can understand wanting to encourage people to get back to work so that small businesses can re-open, but there were no exceptions made for people at high risk for severe Covid symptoms or caring for someone in their family with high risk."
20936,"People had to move out of their homes if their family was high risk and others were forced to work public-facing jobs in a state suing local governments from enacting a mask mandate, despite having medical conditions that meant they were going to need hospitalization if they caught it."
20937,"If they quit, no unemployment."
20938,Win/win in her book.
20939,"Our schools were forced back open, she refused to buy enough tests (we are running out), and we were the only state to never have safer-at-home orders (outside of one region for two weeks)."
20940,"Our positivity rate is now between 35-40% every day, our schools are re-opening (they shut for two weeks), and she finally just made a mask mandate that was two pages long and contained more exclusions and exceptions than requirements."
20941,"What she did do, instead of funding tests, state unemployment benefits, or small businesses, was spend a good chunk of the money on things like upgrading her staff's computer system."
20942,"She misappropriated funds multiple times and it is no wonder we are third in the nation for cases per million, but 45th for tests per million."
20943,I'm sure Florida isn't the only state to be covering shit up.
20944,This reaction was over the top though.
20945,I hope those officers are shamed and disciplined.
20946,But they'll probably just get a month off paid leave and told to not do it again.
20947,Jury trial.
20948,She needs to demand a jury trial and tell her peers why she did it.
20949,"This was civil (would have done the same thing criminally), but I found a defendant 100% at fault and awarded $0 to the plaintiff."

21136,The government’s bungled “response” is one of the most shameful moments in US history.
21137,Iran's entire GDP is $450 billion
21138,I guess we're just going to see how low we can go now.

21140,"""Preexisting conditions"" is insurance babble for putting the onus of being healthy solely on the individual so we can utterly ignore the health-deteriorating conditions and ass-backwards priorities of our society."
21141,"It's the same gaslighting bullshit as ""individual carbon footprint"" from oil companies."
21142,"We focus on ""preexisting conditions"" and not someone's ""being a human being"" so we can dismiss that individual crisis as just their fault for dying of Covid and leave it at some crass survival of the fittest bullshit...We make ourselves complacent about ignoring how our government's response to this crisis is willfully killing Americans and leaving them destitute."
21143,We put the responsibility on the dead so we don't have to acknowledge how much a disaster like this happens outside of our individual control.
21144,I'm sorry for your loss.
21145,No one deserves to be treated this way.
21146,I think there was 1 Iranian lol
21147,Same.
21148,I lost interest in drinking by June.
21149,Our zoom thanksgiving was the first time I had more than one servicing of alcohol since July.

21153,Your employer has no business in your medical affairs.
21154,To defend that is absurd.
21155,Narrator: they won’t.
21156,This is sad.
21157,"I’m going to need a source unless you a referencing federal and local governments or the entire system that was created with state’s rights, but federal funding is needed to run those states in instances like this"
21158,"Jeez, sounds like informing anti-vaxxers of these companies will likely cement their beliefs."
21159,Smart of her to have a camera going while she answered the door.
21160,Very smart indeed.
21161,Imagine being that person who hides in your basement making bombs and spying on your neighbors instead of helping them and being kind.
21162,What's confusing is I thought the US already had an agreement to buy up to 500M vaccines.
21163,Not sure how that factors into this.
21164,"Either way, i really hope Astra and J&amp;J get approved for emergency use next month (in addition to Pfizer and Moderna) to help with supply, globally."
21165,"Sucks that certain countries will have to wait longer...

'The U.S. government will pay the companies $1.95 billion upon the receipt of the first 100 million doses, following FDA authorization or approval."
21166,"The U.S. government also can acquire up to an additional 500 million doses."""

21168,THEY POINTED A GUN AT CHILDREN?!?
21169,How can ANYONE defend that?!
21170,?
21171,Smart people.
21172,[deleted]
21173,Impossible?
21174,"No, and nowhere did I say it’s impossible."
21175,You seem to have a real problem with reading comprehension and understanding nuance.
21176,"I said there is no evidence for it, and the studies done have not raised that as a concern."
21177,"This person stated it as a guess/hypothesis, but did not actually provide any evidence for that suggestion, and since it’s tied to how they derived the vaccine in the first place I would hazard a guess that it’s previously come up and not been a cause for concern."
21178,"Also, small amount of people?"
21179,"40k is not a small sample, that’s a massive population of people for a sample size."
21180,"Even assuming only 20-25k got the actual vaccine and not placebo, that’s still a perfectly fine sample size."
21181,Most medications are tested on similar sample sizes.
21182,"Besides which most trials went for 3-4 months, not 2."
21183,"It’s your right to not get the vaccine, just keep distancing, stay away from large groups, stay away from vulnerable people, and wear your mask for the next year + while covid slowly dies out."
21184,"Oh not only isn’t that true, but the freedom-loving patriots who shriek about government overreach will be the first to kneel and lick every jackboot to a glossy sheen."

21186,realy tells you everything fucked up about the states.
21187,"Do nothing to control the virus, then do nothing to help those cleaning up."
21188,"They let it burn out of control until it became apparent that it was a disaster, then decided to sacrifice a city of millions."
21189,"I wouldn't call 1-2 months of concealing and lying ""swift""."
21190,That time was crucial for the rest of the world.
21191,"I think a lot of people are misunderstanding this, or perhaps I am."
21192,To me it looks as if we the US won’t offer assistance to other countries before we have enough for Americans.
21193,Basically what we do get we won’t be giving to another country.
21194,And not that we’re not allowing the companies to get the vaccine to these other countries that might have a contract already.
21195,And from other articles I’ve read it sounds as if it’s us that actually need more vaccines
21196,I think you underestimate how damn hard it is to actually create the vaccine.
21197,Testing each one would be leagues easier.
21198,Still difficult tho.
21199,Yep.
21200,It’s everywhere.
21201,Truth always comes out.
21202,Right?
21203,Those people most likely stayed home.
21204,"All I'm saying is that football players, especially modern-day players are bigger, faster, and stronger."
21205,"And the game's linemen are especially much bigger, which increases their risks for hypertension...as described on those studies."
21206,And hypertension is an important comorbidity in regard to COVID-19.
21207,"I'd imagine that [these dudes](https://s.wsj.net/public/resources/images/PJ-BK010_FATJER_P_20121003001607.jpg) could probably outrun me in the 40, or post a faster 3-cone-drill....but if you're telling me that their body types are NOT COVID-19 risks?"
21208,I don't know what to tell you.
21209,Is there?
21210,Cus that’d open up the govt to a huge can of worms.
21211,"There’s a lot of players involved in mortgages, can mortgage servicers, underwriters, MBS broker dealers, investors all claim restitution from the government because of this?"
21212,Not just landlords involved.
21213,60% would probably do it.
21214,People vaccinated will likely be able to go without masks about 3 weeks after their second shot.
21215,&gt;Probably was the vaccine then.
21216,probably nothing.
21217,"neither you nor the person you're replying to has enough to go on to establish what's probable in their situation, other than next-coin-flip odds"
21218,What's interesting is that's the part of this story you are most troubled about.
21219,I was lucky/unlucky.
21220,Ate at a friend's pub that was one of the earlier restaurants to go belly up.
21221,"She was thinking of getting out of the business anyhow, but definitely not like this."
21222,She discussed how bad it was that night &amp; made the decision that evening.
21223,Closed up less than a week later.
21224,She said she'll have a new PC tomorrow so just seized
21225,because both have to do with human psychology.
21226,Just because the government says something doesn't mean people will follow.
21227,They will continue to what they want just in more and more dangerous ways
21228,"Shocker, the headline is misleading...
“The Grant County Health District said it hasn’t yet definitively linked those deaths to the wedding”"
21229,They could control the narrative?
21230,Have you seen Trump speak?
21231,Are you purposefully being naive or
21232,Oh that explains some of the thefts we've had.
21233,"Multiple hearing aids, other light snatchables."
21234,"It was always weird and, yeah, they always claimed it was her undiagnosed dementia."
21235,Then what's your better solution?
21236,"Tell me a better way to unfuck this situation, and no that doesn't include ""more of what we've been doing"" which is basically just saying yolo and letting people crush themselves nuts to butts into bars literally every chance they get."
21237,All the drugs everyone puts in their body but... all of a sudden you’re prude?
21238,Hard eye roll.
21239,Wtf!How are those cops acting proportionately to the 'threat'.Those kids will be traumatized.Seems like extremely poor training or someone trying to send a message.Real bad either way
21240,Let’s tell trans people they can’t work their either than.
21241,There’s plenty of transphobic people in the world and employing them hurts business!
21242,"The same for people with disabilities or heck, let’s just say ugly people can’t work their either!"
21243,Your point is scary and mandating people to do things with their bodies to get employed is a bad idea
21244,Yea.
21245,The masses don’t understand.
21246,We could’ve definitely acted sooner and been more prepared.
21247,Instead they used this to restructure the economy.
21248,You should all read the credible reason for her firing and trouble with the law.
21249,This article is one-sided.
21250,I have no horse in this race.
21251,They should be charged with negligent homicide.
21252,So sick of seeing this shit.
21253,At least Americans have guns to protect them from a tyrannical government.
21254,Or something.
21255,"I'm from all/rising, what is the story?"
21256,The only thing that gives me hope that Trump won't do something horrible like this (or do something like tell his supporters not to get it) is that he's already fairly invested in taking credit for the vaccine.
21257,"Oh, I by no means am arguing that the Trump admin doesn't have blood on its hands."
21258,"There has to be an inquest once we get the virus under control, as Republicans in the US have murdered more Americans than most of our historical enemies."
21259,"Still, China is not a hero in this pandemic."
21260,"Chinese doctors and nurses are heros, the CCP and Xi are responsible for letting the genie out of the bottle."
21261,The floor here is made of floor.
21262,That seemed slightly more aggressive than it needed to be.
21263,Nursing homes are the human equivalent to factory farms.
21264,The people working there just want their wages so they can keep living under capitalism.
21265,"It's just a job to most of them, the welfare of the people they have to care for is not a factor"
21266,😆

21269,with a gun?
21270,I think George Soros had it installed over the weekend.
21271,[deleted]

21273,They should raid DeSantis' home for all the people he murdered.
21274,Why even have long-term care facilities?
21275,"By your logic, old people should just be thrown in a pile to die."
21276,"And no, despite your self-protective mythologizing, a COVID death is not quick."
21277,It's horrible.
21278,There are much milder ways to die.
21279,You've raised some amazing kids.
21280,I'm sure that means more to her than you even know.
21281,I hope you and your kids have a wonderful Christmas!
21282,Decreases US influence in the world in favor of China.
21283,But ya no difference in terms of vaccine availability for anyone.
21284,"My grandma went in, left when she passed and her wedding ring was gone."
21285,"Wasn’t anything fancy but damn, who the hell would do that?"
21286,This story is going to be huge.
21287,It’s spreading like wildfire.
21288,"Uh, no."
21289,I’ve lived in Florida my whole life.
21290,This likely won’t affect his re-election chances at all.
21291,"He’s a ultra right-wing, openly racist, sociopath."
21292,"So, the poster boy for the GOP."
21293,"If they kill enough people, government will be super small."
21294,"Adversarial policing has become a norm in the US, in their recruiting, their training, their social culture, and in their equipping."
21295,It's why the calls to fix toxic policing have grown so loud.
21296,Most Americans don't realize we incarcerate a larger fraction of our population than any other country in the world.
21297,About 10 x as many as Europe.
21298,We are THE police state.
21299,"It's why I politely say no every time some law enforcement charitable fund asks for money, and vote against more funding every time it appears on the ballot."
21300,I won't even watch the 30% of television programming that amounts to copaganda.
21301,"My mom is a covid ICU nurse, and she hasn't seen anything like this before."
21302,The stories she tells me are heartbreaking.
21303,She has also worked 6 12-hour shifts in the last 7 days due to her unit being so busy.
21304,Most of them.
21305,"They seem to scare themselves in every situation, and made an internal culture of paranoia and fear."
21306,"They hide as often as they can, and when they can't hide they'll pull out the gun and hide behind that."
21307,One can only hope
21308,Obviously they felt threatened by her fully automatic assault data
21309,"The new slang term for COVID is:

The Republican Disease."
21310,"When you look at the demographics, somewhere after Heath care workers, the elderly and the poor, you may start to find Republicans and then idiots, then the rest of us."
21311,Maybe but this can't be ignored.
21312,This will be published everywhere.
21313,The footage is just too good.
21314,This is fucking infuriating.
21315,I hope the new Justice department will go after any government official who used their power to harass whistleblowers.
21316,When I see these posts I always have to check what facility.
21317,My grandma died in a nursing facility a few weeks ago.
21318,The facility has posted no updates since the day after she died.
21319,And I feel unresolved.
21320,I need someone to blame.
21321,Right now I've just got the physician who terminally sedated her without telling her family.
21322,Sorry for the ramble.
21323,This is such a horrible year.
21324,This is legitimately insane.
21325,"I get paying everyone 2k a month, I’d support that even if i got a significantly smaller check for making good money."
21326,But 90 day full lockdown where no one can leave except to get groceries?
21327,0% chance is followed or even enforced by local/state police.
21328,And if you nationalize the guard or send the military in (violates Posse Comitatus) you’d get massive unrest and upheaval over it.
21329,It would.
21330,They don't care though.
21331,I left my tablet in a Starbucks bathroom once.
21332,Took me less than a minute to realize it.
21333,"Went back, it was gone."
21334,Called the police.
21335,All they would do is file a report.
21336,Could easily check the camera to see who went in to the single person bathroom after me.
21337,But nah.
21338,Too much trouble.
21339,They wouldn't so much as enter the store.
21340,Gonna be a rough time for those who've skirted past the last 8 months.
21341,Things are not gonna get any better.
21342,It doesn't take a genius to figure out that many Americans won't willingly take the vaccine even when it comes out.
21343,Developed countries have already begun their recovery while I bet you good money Covid-19 will still be an issue in the US a year from now.
21344,The lagged effects of our bullshit tradewars have barely shown itself before we turned the money printers to 11.
21345,We're rewriting monetary policy textbooks every single day now.
21346,But pretty much anyone in the know knows that it's gonna be grim for the working class in America for the next few years...
21347,"No, they can't."
21348,"When it comes to an event involving Trump, Trump controls the narrative."
21349,The only winning move is not to play.
21350,Luckily my last restaurant meal was one of my favorite places in this city.
21351,"Damn, though..."
21352,I miss it.
21353,"We've ordered from the place since then, but it's just not the same."
21354,"Something about a highly comunicable disease that kids can spread, heard some rumour about it."
21355,"in all fairness your white bread life is far from the normal circumstance so your anecdote, while good for you, is worthless"
21356,"TBH I think anyone still holding out and trying to help control covid, will 99.99% get a vaccine, in time to make a difference."
21357,It's too much of a long con to be holding out AND be an anti-vaxxer.
21358,Frankly anyone still trying their best to control infections are on the same team.
21359,"Things have gotten more civil, and people are actually talking which is definitely nice."
21360,"By the time any of this actually matters we'll have a good idea of mid term risks, and we'll have a good idea of long term risks due to the early tail ends showing up."
21361,So there really is no point one upping each other on how soon we'll get the vaccine.
21362,"I still have ""Fauci says vaccine 'may be ready for all Americans this year'"" on 27/12/20."
21363,"That will 

TLDR; as a certified member of the peanut gallery, I will 100% be getting vaccinated once Health Canada approves a vaccine, and it is made available for wide use."
21364,The other time was summer and cautiously let him go for almost 3 months.
21365,Luckily cases were significantly lower then.
21366,But this time around it's obviously different.
21367,I think the sick part is probably the most likely since its only two weeks.
21368,EDIT: I can't believe attorneys have been able to get people out of jail because of COVID concerns.
21369,It's time for people to start suing!
21370,"Give them a break they've been up on speed all night, they're seeing little men peeping out from between the cupboard doors, they haven't slept in weeks, and truth be told, they haven't holstered their gun in weeks."
21371,"60-70% of KN95 masks are not as effective as they claim as in they're not filtering anywhere near 95% of particulate, and the cloth masks in many cases filter nearly nothing at all."
21372,We would be in a different position if we could purchase legitimate and well fitting N95 masks.
21373,Hey no problem every day I’m thankful I don’t live in the state of Florida.
21374,In fact I think that the governor of Florida is probably lucky I don’t live in Florida.

21380,People have the right to not get exposed to COVID because their dipshit coworker refused to get a vaccine
21381,But she has scary facts
21382,[deleted]
21383,"A lot of restaurants around me are adapting to a ""pod"" style approach which I think is very clever."
21384,Each dining party gets their own pod (usually a half storage container or a clear bubble igloo) that's cleaned after every guest dines.
21385,"Damned if they do, damned if they don’t."
21386,If they dont wana get a vaccine cause they didnt kiss trumps butt then thats on them i dont care.
21387,Let them face the cosequences of their actions.
21388,"For perspective, my wife works at a nuclear power plant."
21389,Your presence in the plant is highly regulated so everyone is briefed about the cardox system before beginning work.
21390,There is at least one example in their fleet where the cardox system triggered without an emergency and the wintergreen had saved a few lives.
21391,"They have a population of [1.3 billion](https://www.worldometers.info/world-population/india-population/)

It’s gonna take a ton of vaccines to achieve herd immunity."
21392,Except it has animal reservoirs just like influenza.
21393,It will keep cropping up.
21394,I assume they will
21395,You're not a very good philosopher if your knee jerk reaction to anything or anyone you can't explain is that they are stupid.
21396,"Maybe they live under different economic, geographic or familial circumstances."
21397,Maybe they means by which they assess risk is different from yourself.
21398,"Sure, their may be some people are just being stubborn or ignorant for the sake thereof, but to paint with such a broad brush is much more stupid than the people you're attempting to paint."
21399,"You only have to look at the ridiculous stance the EU are taking this very week in getting a trade deal, to know my feelings on the EU."
21400,They are power hungry protection racket that won't accept that we are leaving.
21401,"Exactly, and it is double edge."
21402,"If there were not incentives like this, they would not have made this vaccine this fast."
21403,As a Canadian this sounds great.
21404,However the reality is the rollout plan for Canada is worse than in the States.
21405,"Our procurement minister has said we won’t have doses until March (at the latest), but then she said “hopefully January”."
21406,So March seems likely.
21407,"And logistically to actually get to administration centres (I have a feeling they are going to do hospital/ sr centre administration) as opposed to primary care physician administration, we probably won’t start getting the shots until mid-April."
21408,I'm a big fan of his.
21409,I liked reading many of his plays
21410,"When people are suddenly concerned about children struggling in school, substance abuse, mental health issues, etc...during the pandemic, what they're really upset about is ""These things are happening to white people now!"""
21411,Sounds like they're just not very concerned  about Covid either.
21412,"There's no scientific reason for these delays, as Fauci has admitted."
21413,To add to this; I’ve heard a good amount of the time it takes to develop vaccines is a matter of funding and paperwork.
21414,In a situation like this where so many are concentrated on fixing this issue it’s likely to be prioritized above all else
21415,They’re interviewing her as if she just won the lottery
21416,Good thing they never specified between 5AM and 5PM!
21417,This is inaccurate.
21418,Tens of thousands of people received the vaccine during theme clinical trials.
21419,🙄
21420,"Still, I think there is no reasonable explanation to get the inferior one, especially given both are free."
21421,"I get your point, but if it comes to that at worst you could just wait a few weeks and get the better vaccine."
21422,95% protection to getting the virus is far superior.
21423,I would just dump the AstraZeneca vaccine totally and refit the factories for the other one to produce more.
21424,What do you expect when their current government is built on conspiracy theories
21425,Why those are legitimate concerns.
21426,My AF unit consists of docs and nurses and not one of them was considering getting the vaccine.
21427,i don't think florida understands how society is supposed to work.
21428,"I love the ""Great News"" flair!"
21429,My husband and I are both essential.
21430,We have worked through this entire pandemic and been exposed to covid multiple times and neither one of us has the ability to work from home.
21431,"The post has ""Great News"" flair now!"
21432,We're not going to get enforcement.
21433,Neither party wants the political blowback from enforcement.
21434,They'd rather have deaths.
21435,"Lockdowns, sure."
21436,But you can’t just make up your own definition of pandemic.
21437,It will still be a pandemic if it’s still prevalent.
21438,Lockdowns aren’t pandemics.
21439,at least 5-7 months
21440,"Define soon, the FDA is slow as fuck and wont even consider an expedited process"
21441,What about if you feel *really* strongly about a political cause or ideology?
21442,I hear ~~riots~~ protests are magic too.
21443,Whatever.
21444,You weren't reading any reports until January and you know it.
21445,meanwhile in america were just gonna wait forever to get started
21446,Now to see if one's eyeballs fall out at the five-year mark.
21447,"They received Sputnik vaccine, not this one"
21448,At this point were probably just going to have to call our losses and revolt across the restrictions
21449,Was watching an interview with Fauci saying that technology has improved so much in the past decade.
21450,Things that would take weeks now take hours.
21451,"We still scrutinise as much as before, if not more now."
21452,Deaths are up and hospitals are already in rough shape.
21453,If you read anything make it this https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2020/12/the-worst-case-scenario-is-happening-hospitals-are-overwhelmed/617301/
21454,It can be stored in a fridge for several days.
21455,For the start as demand is high you only need cold storage at the manufacturer and maybe a few central locations.
21456,"In Europe, all national shipping is overnight so no reason to keep the vaccine for more than 5 days before using it."
21457,"We’re definitely fallible, don’t let Trudeau’s competency fool you."
21458,Some of our provincial leaders are idiots.
21459,Ontario’s leader Doug Ford (brother of crack addict Toronto mayor Rob Ford) is completely content to let covid run rampant until the vaccines come.

21461,We’re just lucky to have Trudeau at the helm and not a leader that is more businessman than common sense...
21462,Naaaah mate he means count everyone who gets the vaccine and then tell the public each day
21463,From a society perspective it does pretty much go back to normal.
21464,The only reason we had lockdowns is to stop the health service being overwhelmed.

21474,I have read that there are more females in hospital because there are more elderly females since the average life expectancy of women is longer.
21475,Additionally more females are frontline healthcare and care home workers.
21476,I do believe that virus is still more severe in men of comparable ages to women.

And every essential worker terrified of bringing the virus home to vulnerable family members

And everyone with debts and school loans who are out of work and back at home with the folks

(or homeless)

And then there are the ones who got it and didn’t fully recover, or wound up with life-long autoimmune diseases triggered by the virus

And the 9-to-1 ratio of people affected per death 😣"

21488,It’s going to be simple plans.
21489,I think the broad brush idea is that someone who is interacting with lots of people is more likely to get sick / die than someone being served by them.

21494,The county executive kowtowed to this loud and ignorant small group of people and allowed schools to submit detailed safety plans for sports.
21495,So the most privileged schools get to ignore common sense and safety for sportsball.
21496,How did the angry people respond?
21497,By starting protests that they couldn't pack the stands and that the games need to allow more spectators.
21498,"🤦🏻‍♀️

You really can't fix stupid and I wish we would stop ignoring safety to appease stupid."
21499,Lol hard lockdown during christmas?
21500,Not possible.
21501,"Not really a suitable analogy, since the vaccine has a 62% chance of stopping you getting the virus (stopping you crashing) and something like 99% chance of saving you if you do get it (saving you if you do crash)."
21502,"Also, you benefit from everyone else getting the vaccine and so reducing the spread (other cars are less likely to crash into you)."
21503,Not even real boxing at that.

21507,I highly doubt that.

21524,Yes I realize there are working parents out there who are completely screwed and may not have support.
21525,But I’m also willing to bet that a lot of the issues are lack of structure and help from the parents.
21526,Parents don’t take responsibility these days and blame the teachers.
21527,The teachers are trying and doing everything they can but they can’t help if there’s no support from parents.

21565,The efficacy has been proven quickly because there are a lot of cases and a lot of volunteers.
21566,"Vaccine trials for less common diseases usually take way longer because there aren’t many volunteers, even though you need way more volunteers (Because the disease is not as common) and you have to wait for funding on top of that."

21756,*
21757,&gt;looks like we are being penny wise and pound foolish.
21758,Yes
21759,It's based on an attenuated (weakened but live) virus.
21760,"Basically, they kicked a zombie's teeth out and de-limbed him, and now they can chain him up and take him on tour to show every postapocalyptic town militia what the danger looks like."
21761,Whereas an mRNA vaccine (e.g.
21762,"pfizer or moderna) is more like using the ip over avian carrier ""internet"" to send everyone videos of zombies eating someone, and then maybe doing a traveling show with some zombie parts stored in formaldehyde (which as we all know kills the rage virus)."
21763,The former carries some risk of actual infection.
21764,"For example, the zombie might wedge itself in the bars of its cage and get a compound fracture in one of its stumps, allowing it to stab some person who nobody likes because earlier in the film they demonstrated that they have perplexingly retained preapocalyptic racism/sexism/antisocial behavior that under the circumstances seems hilariously out of place."
21765,"The MRNA vaccines carry a different set of risks that, while technically less understood, are also very clearly orders if magnitude lower."
21766,"Namely, autoimmunity and reduced immunity."
21767,"Basically, people will either mindlessly attack the infrastructure displaying the genuinely harmless zombie media, or they'll get so used to seeing zombies up close that they'll be less able to react when exposed to the real thing."
21768,"All testing so far has indicated that the mRNA approach has a superior risk profile, but we've only been doing it for a few years, so we don't have a lot of long-term data."
21769,Is your Google broken?
21770,"Whew good thing the white house ordered 100,000,000 less vials than Pfizer recommended /s"
21771,Yeah.
21772,But an animal version of it jumping to humans is less likely to happen every year than flu constantly updating itself every year.
21773,Of course it doesn't mean it won't happen but SARS has been around for some time.
21774,Maybe this will be a wake up call and the necessary precautions will be taken.
21775,China lost so much PR after this debacle (even though they were able to manage pandemic themselves) and maybe they will also join in efforts to prevent another pandemic.
21776,More importantly we have multiple vaccines that we can develop upon and next version hopefully can be contained within a few months.
21777,International cooperation is the key here.
21778,"Countries are becoming more antagonistic toward each other with regards to common values but they may create some real cooperative framework with regards to real issues rather than doing symbolic gestures, creating virtual useless international institutions"
21779,Lol test it out on the Brits
21780,"As soon as a hospital gets a dose, they're giving it out, they'll get more in a few weeks for second doses."
21781,They're not going to keep half the doses in freezers for three or four weeks on a rolling basis.
21782,Fuck off fauci
21783,"Might have been just 50 cousins, it was a group of posts, so I might have mixed some up."
21784,It’s funny you think people would be willing to give up another year of their lives.
21785,How is that linked to antivax ?
21786,I'm curious as a French.
21787,"I mean, I take all my vaccins but also use homeopathic when the symptoms do not warrant medicine."
21788,I would link homeopathy to anti medicine more than antivax.
21789,And also how we can be the first country ?
21790,I'm curious to how they calculated it.
21791,Then I guess the world will just have to live with this virus that leaves over 99% of people just fine.
21792,Oh well.
21793,Life (mostly) goes on.
21794,We did it guys!
21795,"As humanity, against all odds and against all shitheads, we did it!"
21796,"I saw it earlier, but it was removed shortly after."
21797,"Yeah all I hear at my workplace is: ""we're 6 feet apart now, we can take off our masks"""
21798,Hospital worker looking at the list of names to receive the vaccine: oooh I'm gonna have fun with this

21802,Because we dont want her to die THIS year.
21803,"Yeah in this subreddit, China is always right and unquestionable."
21804,It takes time to review?
21805,"The FDA doesn't do rolling reviews so they have to review everything at once which is over 100k pages of info, they're voting on Thursday whether to approve or reject the BioNTech/Pfizer vaccine for EUA"
21806,Def been drinking more this year.
21807,I have also had a steady weight gain.. and i think its the booze and lack of physical activity.. from 3 sports a week..TO NONE
21808,"Yep, China's sinovac isn't as good so it's time for them to submit"
21809,How about not visit people at all.
21810,"They tried nothing, and are discovering just how well nothing works."
21811,This is quite funny!

21817,Almost as much as the USA for a smaller population!
21818,At least you guys have Operation Wrap Speed.
21819,Isn't the Sinovac Vaccine similar to the J&amp;J one?
21820,"Here in Germany of example, they only placed on an order on the Pfizer vaccine in November..."
21821,I can only comment as to their claim of less severe cases when people contracted covid after vaccination.
21822,I’m uninterested in opinions as to their honesty and prefer to take the attempted saviors of humanity a their word.
21823,Go Europe!
21824,"epidemiologist in training in a phd program right now, i totally feel you."
21825,a lot of the people in my cohort come from countries with a lot greater respect for public health than the u.s. and i've been thinking a lot about moving after this program if things don't improve over the past few months

21836,Now he can bite his thumb whenever he wants.
21837,Ughhhh tell that to my in-laws.
21838,"They are convinced spending 2 minutes outside at the gas station pump is just as bad as spending 45 minutes indoors talking with your mask off with other unmasked, talking people 5 feet away."
21839,"They think because both have a non-zero possiblity of infection, that means they're equal."
21840,I can't get through to them!
21841,!
21842,Why would she be at the top of the list?
21843,And the question was if they wanted to take it as soon as it's available which is a huge difference from wanting to take it at all.
21844,Lots of people who aren't antivax are sceptic of a vaccin developped so fast and want to see the effects first.
21845,It doesn't mean they are antivax.
21846,"Anyways, general public is far from being the first having to take it."
21847,"First sick people, healthcare workers etc."
21848,"It's not necessarily that side effects would be rare, it's that there simply hasn't been enough time to even look for some of the possible side effects."
21849,"For example, Pfizer's vaccine carries the risk of sterilizing women if given before puberty."
21850,We'll never know if that's an actual effect until years have passed and we measure it.
21851,In MA the homeless are actually ahead of the generally healthy population in the pecking order for the vaccine.
21852,This might depend on your state.

21881,"You are free to take whatever vaccine you can get your hands on, but taking another vaccine would very likely mean you are dropped from the J&amp;J trial."
21882,I will take your word for it.
21883,How does it make sense that the UK approves the vaccine ahead of the US?
21884,Just one more example of how beauracratic stagnation has allowed covid to grow and prosper.

21918,"In general I like the design principles; easy, cheap, made for the masses."
21919,Stockholders or whatever?
21920,"Harris said that if it was backed by medical professionals, like fauci, she would take it- but if Trump was pushing it, she wouldn't."
21921,It was a political hit more than anything.
21922,"Cuomo is in legal fight with Trumps admin because of Trump's intent to distribute the vaccine through private organization's, meaning it could end up not getting through to lower income areas of New York."
21923,"I got chills reading this, same btw"
21924,"Original, thought-provoking."
21925,I wear my mask all the time (except in the car and in my house) and I consider myself luck that at this point I still don't personally know anyone who has died from it and I only recently started to have friends who have caught it.
21926,"The ones who have caught it said it's not a walk in the park but, I'm pretty sure, they all recovered from it, although none of them have come right out and said ""I still can't taste anything,"" or anything to that effect."

21955,"Because the UK is better than the US, deal with it"
21956,It’s not important to this guy until someone he personally knows joins the list of the dead.

21958,I was a teenage girl when the HPV vaccine came out in the early 00s.
21959,I will say my family has disgust for the anti vax movement and especially because my brother has autism were hyper aware of the anti vax sentiment.
21960,The AMOUNT of that exact anti vax rhetoric “I trust vaccines but not this one because it’s new” for Gardisil was so strong that I fell for it.
21961,Ended up getting the vaccine in my early twenties before I aged out of the efficacy timeline.
21962,My sister tried it Thanksgiving.
21963,We were told 6 people in my state.
21964,I miss seeing my family but I very much like the idea of not possibly killing my family more.
21965,That Pfizer turned down the money yes.

21972,That was pretty much the moment when people all felt they had earned their epidemiology degrees and wouldn't listen to any guidance anymore.
21973,We haven't done a good job of measuring the burden of disease at all.
21974,Hopefully the newly liberated CDC will have some good data.

21977,&gt; Care home residents not vaccinated yet as logistical challenges of transporting vaccine at required temperature still being worked out.
21978,Man if the UK still hasn’t figured this out my third world country that ordered 3 million doses is fucked.
21979,Final surge?
21980,"Not here in the US where more than half the population is not wearing masks, attending super spreader events and in general, being imbeciles."
21981,Maybe by 2022 we will have a good shot of saying we’re starting to see things look better but next year is still going to be just as bad as this year.
21982,Canada's Healthcare system is only moderately better than the US'.
21983,"And in the US, you can actually pay for better care."

21989,.... does this even need to be said?
21990,I'm questioning years of propaganda that America was ever great.
21991,Actually people are thinking about it and planning for it.
21992,"Yes, the virus might be different but the medical advancements are huge and will be applied for decades to come."
21993,"The US  has time to work on better responses - build more hospitals, begin to manufacture and develop more in house supplies, encourage research and develop better responses."
21994,Imagine if the response from your government was open and honest earlier in the pandemic.
21995,"More people would have taken this seriously instead of thinking it was a joke that would ""disappear"" like magic."
21996,"Actual, bans of travel done early in February could have really slowed down the virus (the one that was imposed still allowed thousands into the country."

21998,I know personally that I will be encouraging our politicians to react differently if there’s any hint of other issues.
21999,"You need to demand that your politicians develop better responses, as do we all."
22000,You need to actively discourage anti-vaccine people and conspiracy theorists from spreading disinformation.
22001,You can become active politically to encourage scientific and medical research in your own country.
22002,"These are real, concrete steps that can be done to mitigate the problems right now, so that IF
your concerns become reality - you aren’t stuck arguing about masks, vaccines and if hospitals are getting paid off - instead of focusing on the tens of thousands of bodies that are piling up around your country."

22006,"Well that was kinda gross analogy,  but spot on."
22007,those are two unrelated statements
22008,Unfortunately having an MD or a BSN does not make you ha expert on immunology or vaccine development.
22009,Most doctors and nurses know nothing on vaccines outside of the basics.
22010,"However, people treat their opinions on it like solid gold."
22011,It's going to be a serious public policy problem moving forward with this vaccine.
22012,This is such an interesting phenomenon that I see play out at my workplace daily.
22013,"People wear a mask religiously when they go out to the grocery store, but when they get to work they let their guard down and the masks come off."
22014,It’s like the 50 people in our office have become some kind of surrogate family in their minds.

WASHINGTON — The coronavirus vaccine made by Pfizer and BioNTech provides strong protection against Covid-19 within about 10 days of the first dose, according to [documents](https://www.fda.gov/advisory-committees/advisory-committee-calendar/vaccines-and-related-biological-products-advisory-committee-december-10-2020-meeting-announcement#event-materials) published on Tuesday by the Food and Drug Administration before a meeting of its vaccine advisory group."
22056,"The finding is one of several significant new results featured in the briefing materials, which include more than 100 pages of data analyses from the agency and from Pfizer."
22057,"Last month, Pfizer and BioNTech [announced](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/11/18/health/pfizer-covid-vaccine.html) that their two-dose vaccine had an [efficacy rate](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/11/20/health/covid-vaccine-95-effective.html) of 95 percent after two doses administered three weeks apart."
22058,The new analyses show that the protection starts kicking in far earlier.
22059,"What’s more, the vaccine worked well regardless of a volunteer’s race, weight or age."
22060,"While the trial did not find any serious adverse events caused by the vaccine, many participants did experience aches, fevers and other side effects."

22062,"We all just stop coming, but when we see each other on the streets we give a little head nod like in the ending of a 90s movie."

22066,"I’ll take the bait, why do you say it’s a “communist socialist hell hole”?"
22067,On one hand I know Twitter isn’t real life and people will actually take this thing to end this pandemic.
22068,On the other hand people are stupid.
22069,"I imagine they’d have to increase prices if it became the norm, space is incredibly valuable."
22070,"There's also the storage issue, the cost issue etc."
22071,In developing countries especially having the specialist equipment needed to store/transport the Pfizer/Moderna vaccine isn't really viable.
22072,The Oxford/AZ vaccine is considerably cheaper as well.
22073,"Also ramping up production on something like this isn't really as simple as ""Build new factories or lease some or ask for government help"" - they require specialist equipment and there's a maximum speed in which things can be done."
22074,The quickest/best way of beating it is with a variety of different vaccines.
22075,"Whoa, stop there!"
22076,What's wrong with mRNA vaccines?
22077,Are there risks?
22078,See what happens when you have socialized medicine?
22079,Wait times are so high that GPs have to do surgery over there.
22080,(This is a joke but the sad thing is that I can totally see people latching onto this and trying to use it as a legitimate argument)
22081,I think that's what the day supposed to mean.

22093,"Bullshit, Harris said she wouldnt take a vaccine that was only approved and reviewed by Trump's politicized White House but would take one approved by actual fucking scientist under no political pressure."
22094,Nobody is royal.
22095,She gets the same treatment as everyone else
22096,That's not quite accurate.
22097,Some state's constitutions require a balanced budget (although even that is open to interpretation in terms of how you think of - e.g.
22098,- cash and non-cash capital expenses and depreciation - and even states with balanced budget amendments may have oversized financial debt in the form of underfunded pension liabilities).
22099,But that is a self-imposed choice.
22100,There is no federal law that precludes states and municipalities from running up debt.
22101,"Nevada is indeed one of those states with a balanced budget requirement, so their financial flexibility is limited."

22108,""", you were respectful with your asking."
22109,"It's our natural response to when we see someone who looks like us, we try to figure out how it *couldn't* happen to us."
22110,"It's why when we see someone we graduated with pass away that we weren't close to, our natural response isn't ""oh my, I'm so sad!"""
22111,"our natural response is ""what happened?!"""
22112,"(I'm talking about people who we are no longer personally connected too, of course.)"
22113,People on this sub also don't like talking about how rare it is for someone who looks this young and healthy to die from COVID-19.
22114,They try to make it seem normal so people will be scared into staying home.
22115,(Staying home is good.
22116,"Staying scared, not so good.)"
22117,"So when we actually see one of these rare cases, it really is our natural response to know why this person succumbed while most others live."
22118,"If it were an 80 year old man, we wouldn't be wondering too hard."
22119,"As a matter of fact, if it were an 80 year old man, he wouldn't even make it on the news."
22120,"I'm not trying to be disrespectful, just trying to be honest here."

22124,"Unless you live in the US, in which case, we now return you to your regularly scheduled societal breakdown and governmental abandonment."
22125,lets fucking gooooooo
22126,Not everyone will want a vaccine using the mRNA approach simply because it’s new.
22127,"My understanding is the Oxford vaccine uses an adenovirus and not the mRNA approach, which some might feel more comfortable with."
22128,There are also distribution challenges with the mRNA vaccines that might prevent rural communities from receiving that vaccine at all.
22129,Not everyone will have every vaccine made available to them.
22130,That's still not very good at all.
22131,Anyone who gets a medical service is a patient.
22132,I hope it doesn’t take too long for average people like me to get it but I’m sure it will

22138,At the time of my post we were at n5 at the amount of NEW infections.
22139,I just wished more people would take this seriously so they could survive and get vaccinated.
22140,Too many people are going to needlessly die before it is their turn to get vaccinated.
22141,But we can buy up plenty of stockpiles chloroquine that was untested at treating covid 19 without any proof?
22142,Let’s not pretend money wasn’t being wasted all over the place at untested means.
22143,"What credentials do you have, specifically in epidemiology?"
22144,Are you a medical doctor or pharmacist with training in infectious disease?
22145,"I’m not trying to be argumentative however, having Mod credentials on Reddit doesn’t qualify you to determine what is “shit” or not."
22146,"If you have academic credentials with expertise in the subject matter, that’s another story."
22147,Otherwise you’re not qualified to make judgements any more than the next person on the internet.
22148,I read about a new study on the efficacy of masks - if I can find the actual journal article I will post it.
22149,Cue all the “zombie apocalypse” comments
22150,The same people who are outraged at every healthy skeptical question about the vaccines are sure going to be confused about how to react to this in a politically correct manner.
22151,"To exit the crises facing humanity ,caused by our self-centered nature, we must learn mutual responsibility, to appreciate our interconnected existence."
22152,"From this point, we can understand how to make our choices correctly, in accordance with Nature's laws."
22153,This is what I don't get.
22154,When did everyone start loving Big Pharma and acting like they're our saviors?
22155,They all have track records of foul play in the name of profits.
22156,"These companies are not trying to save us, they have MASSIVE government contracts to get these vaccines out by any means possible."
22157,"If they don't roll out the vaccine, they don't get paid."

22163,"The talked to the regulators about the mistake, but where allowed to continue."
22164,"However, this is not a scientifically sound way of running a trial, so the results of the arm with two different doses are being treated as at least suspect."
22165,"Hence, why the headline reads ""**up to** 90%""."
22166,In fact they are already planning a second study to determine whether those results can be replicated.
22167,"Whatever we can do to get it back I'm all for, I'm looooong over do for an international trip."

22170,Figure it out how?
22171,Do another trial phase before we can deploy the vaccine?
22172,They will die.
22173,Next question?
22174,The UK also has a high amount of alcoholism.
22175,"Happy to address both parts of your question -- but I think you may have a typo in your second question, would you mind restating?"

22178,That’s awesome.
22179,You are so lucky!!
22180,!
22181,Please remember the vaccine will only protect from COVID.
22182,"Depending on your risk profile, you may fare better advocating old people to get the stuff first, as they clog the hospitals for *all* issues."
22183,"So, if you get a dose but the old fuck won't, you maybe more likely to die from a heart attack or accident, overall."
22184,"That said, I feel exactly the same."
22185,"I would have to wear the mask and keep a distance all the same, but just knowing, my chances of getting sick or likely even spreading it are extremely slim, would mean a fucking lot for my peace of mind."
22186,"I would only be waiting in decency, secretly knowing the crisis is over, for me."

22191,Really?
22192,My level of education disagrees.
22193,What about those people partying during a pandemic?
22194,Or the high percentage of black people who are anti-vax?
22195,Does that sound smart to you?
22196,Why do we assume that adverse reactions in traditional vaccines will be simular in time frame with mrna vaccines?
22197,Also the mrna a common cold creates Irishman the same as the mrna that a lab is creating?
22198,Aren't the inherently different nucleotide strains?
22199,If not why wouldn't the common cold offer the same protection?
22200,"There are other replies in this thread addressing this, but the likelihood of side effects emerging long after vaccination is incredibly small."
22201,This is why FDA required 2 months follow up after the last dose.
22202,"From the FDA's review: ""Adverse events considered plausibly linked to vaccination generally start within 6 weeks of vaccine receipt.7 Therefore, a 2-month follow-up period may allow for identification of potential immune-mediated adverse events that began within 6 weeks of vaccination."""
22203,Yeah I was thinking this or that the vaccine somehow caused some liver dysfunction in some so they can say that it was because they drank instead
22204,[deleted]
22205,I have frontline relatives working in hospitals that are reluctant to take the first initial doses when made available.
22206,This is also someone who has been treating this like the airborne AIDS from the beginning.
22207,When you have even medical staff reluctant to take the vaccine.
22208,"What about factoring in the population that believes that its a hoax or mah freedumbs, anti-vaxexr crowd."
22209,Herd immunity needs 70-80% of the population to be vaccinated to work.
22210,The herd mentality on the otherhand......
22211,Most people aren’t wiping down groceries now in the middle of the pandemic.
22212,Who the hell do you people hang out with that you think that’s normal?
22213,Sometimes I hear stories about how patients treat staff and I'm always appalled.
22214,Why would someone be abusive toward someone trying to help you?
22215,Ok I see them
22216,Where are the other coronavirus related subreddits at?
22217,"Unfortunately, blacks and hispanics are dying at 3x the rate of white Americans."
22218,Which is exactly why I believe some are trying to spread it as much as possible.
22219,"So to clarify, the vaccine works and is confirmed to be safe?"
22220,Exactly.
22221,Don't think for one second any social distancing measures are being done altruistically.
22222,It's only being done to prevent hospitals from having to shutter their doors.
22223,"If we knew we would never run out of space and be able to treat every patient, nothing would had shut down."
22224,Whatever you want to believe I guess.
22225,If he wasn't a shithead he would invite Biden to be there too and then it would be an actual sign of unity against a threat to America and the world.
22226,But who are we kidding?
22227,...
22228,I don't think you fully understand how vaccine manufacturing or regulations work.
22229,Also all of the ones seriously considered right need 2 doses.
22230,"Yes, the vaccine will reduce the spread and therefore the likelihood that you will be infected, but that doesn't mean that if you have the vaccine you cannot spread it or that a vaccinated person cannot infect you (if that is the point you are trying to make)."
22231,One other way to think about it: we have to manufacture the target protein someplace and get that target protein into the body so the immune system recognizes it.
22232,"An mRNA vaccine's trick is to use the protein machinery in our own bodies to make that protein (for a limited period of time, since that's how mRNA works)."
22233,"Otherwise, you're making that target protein in chicken eggs, yeast or something else, harvesting and purifying it, then injecting it into our bodies."
22234,The mRNA techniques remove this external manufacturing process.
22235,In that case the timeline would be virtually the same as their 'standard bureaucratic timeline' - i.e.
22236,run of the mill drug approvals where they're taking their sweet time.
22237,"Either way, there's a huge problem here."
22238,We’re still learning about the long term affects on kids.
22239,Why risk their lives?
22240,"“We worry that the long-term effect would be in essentially brain growth,” he said, a particular concern among children and young adults whose brains are still developing."
22241,"A series of four similar cases were detailed in a recent study published by JAMA, spearheaded by doctors at the Great Ormond Street Hospital, The children were part of a larger cohort of 27 young patients who had suffered from the recently recognized multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children, or MIS-C."
22242,"They developed new-onset neurological symptoms, in the absence of other respiratory symptoms."
22243,"Trump 

A fair number of people who get this disease wind up with some neurological manifestations, and these range from very mild to severe life-threatening conditions,” he said."
22244,"“People who survive will recover from the respiratory failure, they'll recover from the kidney disease, but the imprint on the brain is likely to be much more long-lasting.”

22261,"&gt; I don't think anyone really expects these vaccines to be one and done, lifelong protection."
22262,That's pretty much how SARS immunity works (through 17 years of data).
22263,"I wouldn't want to count on it, but we should certainly *expect* very long-term protection."
22264,We're literally gonna be one month to a month and a half behind the UK and three weeks behind compared to the US and Canada and I don't get what's the reason behind it when the EMA has been receiving information from Pfizer for more than a month already

22349,"I’m just thinking that if I were part of the trials (and I received the vaccine and not a placebo), I don’t know how the medical staff would be able to determine if I didn’t catch covid just because I wasn’t around people that were sick or that the vaccine actually prevented me from getting sick."

22619,"In the case of narcolepsy, the people who got it were affected right away (weeks to a couple of months), it was just so rare it took years to prove the association."
22620,The point stands that side effects have a relatively quick onset.

22653,I haven't heard that it prevents them from spreading covid.
22654,"Yes, I'm very welcoming to a link to better inform me if there is indeed evidence that they block people from spreading covid."

Good news is that the last 5% don't die immediately, but rather may not be effectively protected and then may have the 0.7% chance of dying from infection with SARS-CoV-2."
22737,"&gt; we know so much about mRNA

We know for example that an infection with SARS-CoV-2 produces a lot more of it than what is introduced by the mRNA-based vaccines, and that some part of infections end in long-term, possibly chronic issues."
22738,"We also know that mRNA vaccines are well tolerated by humans: https://www.nature.com/articles/nrd.2017.243, and we now know that the immunity these mRNA vaccines provide is protective against severe SARS-CoV-2 infection (see recent publications by Moderna and Pfizer/BioNTech) without widespread or long-lasting effects."
22739,"We also know that mRNA is quickly degraded in our cells and cannot replicate on its own, and thus does not persist for long."
22740,&gt;What identification of at-risk individuals has been done?
22741,I haven't read that anyone giving the mRNA vaccines is doing any kind of risk assessment.

22788,"“The only number I would say that is asked is the date of birth.”

If that's true, there's also no way the data can perform the functions for which they say they're collecting it."
22789,"Because we don't have national ID numbers, and the closest thing we have to one is an SSN or DL number, the list won't be accurate enough to track people, because it will have the same problems the no-fly list does... people with the same name will get confused, missed, etc."

22952,a turnaround time of 9 months for a vaccine from development to approval is pretty damn good I'd say.

22976,Even before it ends it's going to get much better once vaccines start going out.
22977,Yeah the definition of better was just that it beat the 50% prevention of symptoms.
22978,2 doses is obviously the more efficacious choice but back in April/May the results of this single dose would’ve been enough to get it approved likely.

23045,I picked a bad time to stop sniffing glue
23046,IDK I’ve been the eternal pessimist but for once I’m hopeful.
23047,We will have very effective vaccines.
23048,Our therapeutics will be dialed in.
23049,Hospitals will not get surges like they are now.
23050,More instant tests will be approved and testing won’t be overwhelmed or backlogged.
23051,Idiots will still get it year after year from refusing vaccines but those with the most risk can bring their risk profile down to very low levels with the vaccines.
23052,Hygiene may remain a bit better but one of the biggest benefits that will probably happen is that flu vaccination rates will remain elevated for years.

23079,The majority of people getting sick with Covid have no idea how they got sick.
23080,And other respiratory viruses are transmitted both in air and by fomites.
23081,"As mentioned just below in a different thread, doing something low risk once is not a big deal, but you integrate cumulative risk over time and the number of times you take the risk."
23082,"10 times, 100 times -- there are a lot of 1% risks that are ignored because they can't possibly show up in the data."

23091,Their data says 62% effective when given the planned dosage.
23092,This 90% claim doesn’t make sense and isn’t backed up by the data.
23093,Well to be fair other countries that *do* wear masks more regularly weren't hit as hard as we were.
23094,Maybe being mindful of spreading illness isn't such a bad thing.
23095,"My concern is with the ""after the vaccine"" part."
23096,When is that?
23097,"Because some people may believe it's ""after *I've got my* vaccine"" and if that comes before many others get theirs then they could be carelessly spreading the virus just because it doesn't negatively impact them."
23098,But you want us to eat inside of a office cubicle

23101,God thats such a trash article.
23102,I read through the whole thing and it's not even pretending to be fair and uses such bad faith logic attacks.
23103,Article highlights some of the reasons the Oxford/AZ vaccine will be significant on the global stage.
23104,"Not mentioned is the lower efficacy in early data vs BioNTech/Pfizer and Moderna, but it's still high enough to get approval and have an impact."
23105,Hopefully the efficacy shows improvement as more data and analysis rolls in.
23106,"I thought the issue was the Oxford trial tested for asymptomatic infection, while biontech and modema just tested for symptoms."
23107,And that could account for the 20-30% difference in effectiveness?
23108,"I haven't seen the data, I'm just trying to understand."
23109,If you're going to make bombastic claims like this provide the evidence for it
23110,What did you do to end the pandemic?
23111,Brought the thiccness.
23112,"if this finding bears out, it sounds like something that would bode rather poorly for recovery."
23113,"Another factor to consider is how long the protection will last, Pfizer said they expect their full protocol will last *at least* one year, but a half protocol might wean off much earlier."
23114,Booster shots are usually design to force the immune system to register a pathogen into long term memory.
23115,Yeah because they're all fucking retarded
23116,Ok so now people will only get one dose
23117,RemindMe!
23118,175 Days
23119,Yeah I feel like 60% is enough to vaccinate lower risk.
23120,"While I understand that, it’s hard to feel it."
23121,I’ve felt totally fucking useless all year long
23122,Or that deleted comment?
23123,"Perhaps, perhaps not."
23124,"I usually have great faith in the FDA, but could have concerns this time regarding how much political pressure they're facing for a quick approval."
23125,I have always called AZ the Ohio of the West.
23126,I live here and NO ONE WEARS MASKS and it shows.

23128,Though I did it using other drugs.
23129,Surely this is manslaughter.
23130,"Besides being a novel (unknown) process (mRNA) and history of vaccine misadventures especially upon market entry, the answer to your excellent question is; they probably can't."
23131,"The EMA will first take its well-deserved Christmas vacation, and then possibly meet up to talk about an approval."

23138,Support local food banks and businesses if you are lucky enough to have a job this year.
23139,People will need more help now than ever.
23140,Which makes sense in the context of us not actually being capable of producing any of these vaccines.
23141,Why would or should we expect to be first in line when we're relying on others for our supply?
23142,"That we're getting access to these first production runs and are looking at a diverse, steady supply from various manufacturers and countries going forward is a testament to how well the Feds have handled vaccine procurement."
23143,The point where I expect this to all fall apart is at the provincial distribution level.
23144,"Most provinces already struggle with the annual flu vaccine, including this year when it was given priority."
23145,"This immunization campaign is much larger and far more urgent, and I expect the process to be tortuous and contentious."
23146,It definitely drops below freezing at night in Reno.
23147,&gt; I don't understand why you would assume someone who doesn't agree with you is hostile.

23233,"Whether or not they’d be using PTO depends on the state and the facility, as does access to testing."
23234,"For example in my state, many AL facilities like the ones I used to run are smaller residential facilities with (most common) ten residents."
23235,"The smaller facilities don’t have the same resources as the large campuses, and certainly aren’t able to test each staff member every day when they show up."
23236,Other states tend to have an equivalence to this model as well.
23237,"Not a fan of the conservatives here, but O'Toole's criticism has been of the speed we will get and not the amount."
23238,"Certainly it remains to be seen how fast rollout is, but he might still be right, or wrong"
23239,The paperwork that should've been done in March also?
23240,I know someone in the US whose spouse (a healthcare worker) already had an appointment to get the vaccine.
23241,"If it's approved, people are ready to MOVE."
23242,Wouldn’t it be some real shit if one of them croaked tomorrow?
23243,Thank you for your reply.
23244,Wise behaviour.

23246,"When you wear a mask, it prevents others from catching it from you."
23247,You are protected when other people wear a mask.
23248,I am not sure what your job is - so somethings may not be possible.
23249,Ask them to eat and drink else where.
23250,People who wear masks always and properly get seated together.
23251,"Look for a solution, not a fight."
23252,Ok lets do this
23253,Yeah you really need those.
23254,"Maybe see if you can get in with an NP somewhere, they tend to be a lot more available and can prescribe meds."
23255,I did that last week and got an appointment in a few days.

23258,"If the CDC guidelines change, our rules will change."
23259,"But we do pessimism on the sub, silly!"
23260,One honest question I do have though is aren't we a bit capped out at the moment at 200 million doses (100 million vaccinated)?
23261,"I believe that's the total number that we ordered from Pfizer and Moderna, and we won't have the ability to procure more until June..."
23262,"I know we have a ton of Oxford doses ordered and some J&amp;J as well which should provide data in the next few months, but it's feeling more likely that a healthy 28 year old like myself is gonna be waiting until Summer..."
23263,Does anyone have any recommendations for dealing with family members that don't take Covid seriously?
23264,My sister just announced she will be hosting a Christmas Eve dinner with all my extended family and I just don't understand it.
23265,Our area has been hitting double digit new cases almost each day for the last two weeks.
23266,They act like I'm the crazy one for wanting to be safe.
23267,Mentally it is starting to get draining.
23268,"My mom is a 67 year old life long smoker, and doesn't care at all."
23269,Dafuuuu?
23270,Best to wait til February to be safe.
23271,"I mean in fairness, if I knew I’d made an enemy of my government by being a whistleblower and a team of cops showed up at my door, I’d probably spend 20 minutes freaking out and trying to get in touch with my lawyer before I opened the door."
23272,"The hospital, who told me they wouldn't do it."
23273,"And the school I work in, where the parents won't take them anyways so they sat in our rooms while their parents all got sick and until enough of our staff tested positive to force closures for quarantines."
23274,I believe the US government intends to make it free for all citizens but who the heck knows if it actually will be free.
23275,"Yeah, I'll never forget graduating high school from the inside of my car"
23276,"This vaccine is incredible in that it's not actually injecting the virus into the body, but just the blueprint."
23277,Vox did a sweet series on this earlier this year.

23282,😂
23283,Pfizer is not the only vaccine lol.
23284,Yes the public will have access to a vaccine by April.
23285,Am I living in an alternative reality?
23286,Lol
23287,The folks at IHME are saying Summer to early fall.
23288,But what do they know?
23289,Wtc vaccine?
23290,"Well maybe not directly, but it might be that the half-full was like a real two dose as the second one was not eliminated by the immunity to the vector."
23291,I don’t know for sure obviously
23292,50% protection for 4 weeks is MUCH better than 0% protection for 4 weeks.
23293,"Also easier to produce, so lower-income countries can hypothetically produce the vaccine themselves rather than relying on imports."
23294,It’s not an update.
23295,Yes probably
23296,"Because at the beginning of the pandemic, that's all people were clamoring about."
23297,My god what even is your question?
23298,“Was she armed?” In 2017 or this arrest?
23299,No.
23300,Did she deserve to have guns drawn on her after not answering the door for 20 minutes and hung up on authorities?
23301,Yes.
23302,They do exist but are fewer in number than you might expect.
23303,"People with legitimate questions and people stoking fear with conspiracies about Bill Gates, 5G, and population control are very different."
23304,Yes!
23305,My wife comes home for lunch now.
23306,She chugs water and eats a huge meal because she can’t safely drink and snack at the office anymore.
23307,She got her annual review and they criticized her for being “combative” with the employee who refuses to wear a mask at the grocery store and goes to bars every weekend.
23308,In a big Florida city.
23309,In a pandemic.
23310,My wife told the lady she’s afraid of her because she’s dangerous.
23311,She also gave the lady info for free coronavirus testing because the woman said she can’t afford a test even if she had symptoms.
23312,"Soooo.. *my wife* is the bad employee, not the shitty selfish coworker?"
23313,"Yeah, my wife feels like a space alien.. no one agrees with her either."
23314,She’s alone on an island.
23315,But weren't the interesting numbers because of giving random size doses?
23316,&gt;wouldn’t it do the greatest good to give vaccines to those without antibodies first and collect data on infections?
23317,I came up with this about 2 months ago (not trying to steal your thunder).
23318,I obviously agree.
23319,To add some finer points.
23320,"&amp;#x200B;

All vaccines are two doses."
23321,Doing an antibody test (labcorp did them for free) as pre-vaccine step is not much more hassle compare to two vaccine doses.
23322,It does not add cost.
23323,step one antibody test.
23324,step two vaccine.
23325,Step three vaccine.
23326,"This only makes it a two step process, and gets people in line, and creates an easily organized ""line""."
23327,It is three appointments instead of two.
23328,This testing step should be going on now.
23329,"Once the line is basically empty, it open to everyone meaning no more testing is needed."
23330,"&amp;#x200B;

Some places near me got hit hard."
23331,"Some places in the USA in May, had over 50% of the population with antibodies (extrapolated from sampling)."
23332,"&amp;#x200B;

The current growing infection is a bit crazy."
23333,Colorado reported currently 2% of the population last week currently had an active infection .
23334,Lots of people who do not need the vaccine.
23335,After thanksgiving it will be more.
23336,Byt time the vaccine gets to the general populations.
23337,20-30% of the US could already have antibodies.
23338,We could get the vaccine people who need the vaccine a lot faster.
23339,"&amp;#x200B;

By all means vaccinate everyone."
23340,"If you have antibodies, you just go to the end of the line  and allow people who have not immunity go first."
23341,"&amp;#x200B;

Lastly did you hear this some place or did you come up with it."
23342,I like having conversations with people who can think outside of the box and solve a problem (without one being obvious).
23343,It's because the FDA doesn't want to take the company's word 100%.
23344,"If the government relies too much on the company submitting the review, it's not too much of a review as it is as a formality."
23345,An example of this failing is Boeing.
23346,The government relied too much on Boeing's internal review that their new planes were safe.
23347,They weren't and we found out the hard way when there were a lot of crashes a few years ago.
23348,"Well, you also say it."
23349,Does being smart make you good or bad?
23350,no.
23351,Does being stupid make you good or bad?
23352,"no

Does being good make your smart or stupid?"
23353,"no

Does being bad make you smart or stupid?"
23354,no
23355,"To the snarky commenters responding below: if you actually understood what 'acute' meant in medical terminology, you'd see that u/Doctor_Realist is making the point that the complications cited correspond to the initial infection and resultant immune response, not to long-term effects associated with what might be considered a subacute post-COVID-19 syndrome."
23356,"Next time, maybe take a moment to educate yourselves before you start typing."
23357,Is it free?
23358,If not any costs announced?
23359,"So with the news that they can't supply any addition for the US until July, how does this affect the timeline for vaccinations?"
23360,"Lymphadenopathy is swelling of the lymph nodes, while it can be an indicator for more serious disease, it is also seen with viral infections like Strep throat."

23364,"](https://youtu.be/AYWNpg7qwus?t=1177)

The 52% figure is more realistic, but still really small sample size because it's only looking at the few week period between dose 1 and dose 2."
23365,"Realistically we need a separate one dose study for more information, but unsure if that will happen."
23366,Number 1: Dont go
23367,They have their own vaccine and they are already rolling it out to other countries.
23368,In fact they started rolling theirs out last week.
23369,"To other countries... India or Indonesia, I forget at present."
23370,That Im hostile is probably the latest.

23376,Where are you seeing that they are similar to normal?
23377,"https://www.cdc.gov/flu/weekly/index.htm

This says only  429 confirmed cases so far this season."
23378,Any chance we get to pick which one we want?
23379,Or do they just administer the one they have on hand at the time?
23380,There's a published (!)
23381,book out there on Amazon that's about a woman who falls in love with a personification of the coronavirus.
23382,"No, not joking."
23383,Took an Uber Saturday; idiot driver left his mask below his nose.
23384,"For whatever reason, I didn't say anything."
23385,"I wore a mask, of course."
23386,I did put both back windows down all the way.

23393,Sounds... painful.
23394,Lots of people unfortunately.
23395,"Hopefully the vaccines are effective enough that most people
who choose to get them are well protected from those who do not."
23396,Of course there are some who cannot get the vaccines because of health issues etc.
23397,I read that we need about 70% of people to get the vaccine in order to achieve herd immunity and protect those people and the latest polls show about 60% of people are willing to get it.
23398,Hopefully another 10% get on board in the next few months.
23399,"I’m just asking out of curiosity, plain and simple."
23400,"Not sure why my question warrants being downvoted like crazy, but whatever that’s Reddit I guess."
23401,&gt; Nobody should expect the vaccine to significantly change their lives before next Summer.
23402,"I disagree because the context is ""significantly changing your life"", which my classification is having bars/restaurants/sporting venues open without fear."
23403,We're expecting ~25 million vaccinated per month putting us at ~175 million by June.
23404,"I'd think that changes would start occurring in April, with normalization by summer."
23405,She took a chance to be in on the grift of conservatives.
23406,Now she is paying the price.
23407,Once I'm vaccinated it's no longer my fault others aren't wearing their masks.
23408,"I wear mine all the time but once the vaccine is widely available, fuck off."
23409,"I'LL SAY IT AGAIN, WIDELY AVAILABLE."
23410,"Don't even bother engaging, just down vote and move on...."
23411,"There’s always one person to use this Asia argument every time there’s a conversation about masks, and yes it is true that there isn’t as much of a stigma against mask wearing from time to time in East Asian countries."
23412,But very clearly that isn’t what we’re talking about here.
23413,"Whenever we’re talking about “masks going away”, we’re never talking about the idea of someone wearing a mask when they’re sick and have to visit the pharmacy."
23414,We’re very clearly talking about abolishing the idea that masks must be mandated whenever you leave your house following sufficient community immunization.
23415,"I apologize if this reply comes off as rude because I know that you’re definitely just bringing a reasonable perspective to the table about how other cultures utilize masks, but I’ve seen the “what about Asia” argument way too often from commenters here, when it very clearly does not apply to this very unique scenario."
23416,Naah what I meant is to count the number of people being vaccinated daily and show the number to the public.
23417,I love how hyperbolic people are.
23418,Suddenly saying wear a mask for a few months until data comes out is synonymous with wear a mask until you die.
23419,I get my flu shot every year at CVS and they do a great job.
23420,And you get a $5 off of $20 coupon!
23421,Bonus!
23422,"They like getting high of their power and attention, this vaccine will take it from them and give us our lives back."
23423,right?
23424,who needs to look that up in wiki to see if it's true?

23439,A drug given emergency authorization is considered experimental.
23440,We don't know if this prevents damage from infection or stops the vaccinated person from spreading the virus.

Is there potential for harm long term?"
23443,"We don't know if this prevents damage from infection, what would be the benefit of taking it if it doesn't?"

&gt;**SARS-CoV-2 viral particles spread between people more readily indoors than outdoors."
23454,"** When outdoors, the concentration of viral particles rapidly reduces with the wind, even a very light wind."
23455,"When indoors, ventilation mitigation strategies help to offset the absence of natural wind and reduce the concentration of viral particles in the indoor air."
23456,"The lower the concentration, the less likely some of those viral particles can be inhaled into your lungs; contact your eyes, nose, and mouth; or fall out of the air to accumulate on surfaces."
23457,"Protective ventilation practices and interventions can reduce the airborne concentration, which reduces the overall viral dose to occupants."
23458,"&gt;  
&gt;Below is a list of ventilation interventions that can help reduce the concentration of virus particles in the air, such as SARS-CoV-2."
23459,"They represent a list of “tools in the mitigation toolbox,” each of which can be effective on their own."
23460,Implementing multiple tools at the same time is consistent with CDC mitigation strategies and increases overall effectiveness.
23461,"These ventilation interventions can reduce the risk of exposure to the virus and reduce the spread of disease, but they will not eliminate risk completely."
23462,"&gt;  
&gt;While the list of tools is intended to be universally applicable across indoor environments, applying them to different building types, occupancies, and activities under environmental and seasonal changes can be challenging."
23463,The specific combination of tools chosen for use at any point in time can change.
23464,It will be up to the building owner/operator (obtaining expert consultation as needed) to identify which tools are appropriate for each building throughout the year.
23465,"&gt;  
&gt;**Considerations to Improve Ventilation**  
&gt;  
&gt;Consider ventilation system upgrades or improvements and other steps to increase the delivery of clean air and dilute potential contaminants."
23466,"Obtain consultation from experienced Heating, Ventilation and Air Conditioning (HVAC) professionals when considering changes to HVAC systems and equipment."
23467,"Some of the recommendations below are based on  [Guidance for Building Operations During the COVID-19 Pandemicpdf iconexternal icon](https://www.ashrae.org/file%20library/technical%20resources/ashrae%20journal/2020journaldocuments/72-74_ieq_schoen.pdf) from the American Society of Heating, Refrigerating, and Air-Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE)."
23468,"In addition to buildings, ventilation considerations are also important when you have multiple persons within vehicles, including public transportation (buses, subways, trains, school buses, carpools, and rideshares)."
23469,Not all considerations are applicable for all scenarios.
23470,No.
23471,If this idiotic scientist thinks I'm wearing a mask while laying on the beach with friends he's completely delusional.
23472,I urge you to read the comment and post history 6 months back of the person claiming they had it and almost died.
23473,They were not diagnosed with it and instead were diagnosed with pancreatitis and had pneumonia resulting from it.
23474,"Each state has distribution plans, however, contracts needs to be created, people needs to be hired, data logging systems needs to be created, locations needs to be identified,  local medical authorities needs to form an administration system, and other logistics needs to be created."
23475,It's a huge task with unknown costs and expenses.
23476,"I read few states Distribution plans because I was interviewing for data analytics for administration throughout USA, 100% travel and at the end, I didnt feels safe."
23477,thanks for the response.
23478,So I am looking at more detailed data.
23479,This is the high level view.
23480,You need to dig into the detailed data to see it.
23481,I can’t wait to watch a movie about this vaccine and what they went through to achieve it.
23482,Why is this such a big deal?
23483,Haven't hundreds or more taken the vaccine during trials?
23484,Why are they not considered the first patients?
23485,Guess I'm confused cause all the headlines make it seem like this is the first ever person to take it.
23486,You'll probably end up with a pet adoption service.
23487,"Eh, if a young person got it you'd flip the argument."
23488,Buy yourself a cabin and fuck off from society if ya got an issue with it.
23489,Heart Attack does not equal cardiac arrest.
23490,A heart attack/cardiac patient needs recourses too.

23505,My only concern is whether or not this vaccine could affect any future pregnancies I may desire.
23506,I am probably done having kids but not positive.
23507,I am majorly pro vaccine and would love to be vaccinated ASAP.
23508,I will always err on the side of just taking the jab.
23509,But I need a doctor to talk me through the protein of it all and reassure me that this particular mechanism won’t have issues.
23510,"hm forgot africa which is actually fine, beside of SA"
23511,"At the start of the pandemic Taiwan's government got their top doctors, epidemiologists and manufacturers together and told them to decide what was needed and how to execute it, and come up with a plan."
23512,2 weeks later they converted certain factories to produce PPE / masks / ventilators.
23513,The factories were staffed by soldiers doing national service.
23514,This flawless execution is why Taiwan was able to donate millions of their surplus scarce PPE to other nations (including the Navajo in the USA) which were then in a mad panic scrambling for things and overpaying for those available.
23515,10 months into the pandemic and US hospitals are STILL short of PPE.
23516,Not sure why many other countries couldn't have done this?
23517,"Because the USA has the DPA but that wasn't used for PPE manufacturing, in fact, it wasn't used until you know who decided he had to keep the meat packing factories open in order for free flow of burgers."
23518,SMH.
23519,Taiwan's biggest advantage is brainpower and superior decision making ability in times of crisis.
23520,"New Zealand did it with political willpower, when their PM declared the goal was to Eradicate Covid, then listed all the measures the government would take including supporting their citizens staying home."
23521,"Tourism is a huge part of NZ's GDP so it was not a decision taken lightly, they just valued lives over money."
23522,Vietnam is huge and has a LAND border with China.
23523,And despite being a poor country they've contained COVID better than many other islands (Hello Caribbean).
23524,That's the real policy winner hands down.
23525,Thankfully it sounds like you had a terrible case of pancreatitis but not really covid.
23526,At least doctors know more about how to treat pancreatitis and resultant infections like pneumonia.
23527,"Maybe don’t post about having had covid if you were only suspected and put in quarantine because some symptoms matched, but were definitely diagnosed with pancreatitis."
23528,It’s a bit disingenuous.
23529,This is very confusing.
23530,"The article states that India is keeping half the vaccines from the Serum Institute, the other half goes to poor countries."
23531,So what about the UK?
23532,I thought they developed it and have ordered a large quantity already?
23533,And India already announced they were going to vaccinate their population first so who knows when they'll actually start supplying other countries.
23534,Then the author accuses the West of hoarding vaccines.
23535,"wth, the West spent billions and that excess is largely going to be donated to poorer countries."
23536,And it's not like they could afford to vaccinate their population at $25 a dose either.
23537,PseudoChristian/Conservative  mindset for starters.
23538,Exactly correct.

23541,"Correct, except strep is a bacteria :)"
23542,Same.
23543,I’m young and healthy so I’m not worried about a disease with a 99% survival rate in my age range.
23544,I don’t believe this number.
23545,1 million a day is just not something I can really wrap my head around
23546,"Could have, maybe would have, but this team definitely did."
23547,This administration of “I don’t take responsibility” has made the wrong call at every turn.
23548,My wife had a side hustle of pet sitting before we met and continued with a select few clients after.
23549,She pet sitting blew up from word of mouth to the point that she had to stop doing it.
23550,She got a pet sitting request fairly recently and she hasn't done it in years.
23551,We had a dog walker pre-covid and that business had 1 main woman and 1 other full timer and a few part timers.
23552,"Once covid hit, the woman had to let everyone go because everyone was working from home."
23553,Last week I saw a few of her signs up which makes me think business is picking up again with people going back to work and holidays.
23554,When it turns out vaccination considerably reduces risk of transmitting the disease you should reconsider for the good of those around you.
23555,"An mRNA vaccine is kinda like a pseudo-virus in its own right, just without a deadly virus payload."
23556,"And so they fall apart fairly quickly at high temperature just like actual viruses themselves do; the trick is making sure they have cells to deliver their mRNA instructions to before they fall apart, just like a virus's goal is to spread itself before *it* falls apart, and like your goal as a human being is to create more human beings before *you* fall apart."
23557,"A vaccine sitting in a bottle, warm and decaying on its own isn't doing anyone any good, it'll be ""dead"" before it gets exposed to anything it could potentially help."
23558,But a vaccine sitting in a warm body has plenty of cells to interact with in the period of time is has before the heat destroys it.
23559,"Like I said it sucks, but it’s only one year."
23560,I know lots of people who are gunna be alone during Christmas.
23561,I’ve worked away from home for years and had to be alone some Christmas and that wasn’t when there was a pandemic killings hundreds of thousands of people.
23562,Looks like the president's defense brigade has arrived for the vote manipulation

23606,This.
23607,My family is fortunate enough to have jobs that have allowed them to truly quarantine for 2 weeks when they want to see someone like my sister and her new baby.
23608,My wife’s family simply can’t do that.
23609,They also don’t take it nearly as serious anyway and it was a hard time getting them to at least agree to do things like get tested and wear masks in the house.
23610,Couldn’t convince them to eat outside because “it’s too cold” ...in Alabama.
23611,"There are multiple layers of problems and every family is different, but the rich definitely have the privilege of still finding ways to do things safely and yet for the poor they just can’t do anything."
23612,No wonder so many of them have just chose to ignore it.
23613,"And the goalposts continue to move...

After this it will be 'Well we don't know the long term side effects'"
23614,"Agreed, once the most vulnerable (nursing homes, elderly with Co-morbidity) get vaccinated and most Covid working healthcare (not every healthcare worker or doctor deals with Covid) get immunized I think the death rates are going to drop drastically."
23615,"Once that happens, the state and local governments will not be able to keep restrictions in place even if they want to."
23616,Better and longer lasting immunity
23617,"Am I missing something, or is the article only 15 words long?"
23618,Explain to them that there's a 30 percent risk of a false negative with PCR tests and a 50 percent false negative risk with rapid tests.
23619,"Some people have taken five PCRs only to test positive for the virus, for example, on the sixth one."
23620,It's a mess.
23621,"Explain to them that you, your partner and your sister don't want to accidentally debilitate or kill your parents or any other loved ones."
23622,"Were wearing masks, social distancing &amp; keeping a fan on?"
23623,"Yes, Trump's invitation was 100% political, so he could try to take credit for others' work."
23624,"Worth remembering this was during the mad, frantic panic when people were screeching from every corner that the US didn't have enough ventilators, and it actually turned out hospitals were too free and easy with ventilating people which ultimately killed them, and most of the purchased ventilators weren't needed."
23625,Have you seen anything on when J&amp;J and AZ are supposed to finish trials?
23626,I haven't seen much
23627,Russia and no alcohol?
23628,Madness.
23629,You can't rush B sober.
23630,Aren't the J&amp;J and AstraZeneca less effective though?
23631,In the UK the regulators were getting and analyzing data as the vaccine companies collected it month by month.
23632,Here in the US the regulators received all the data at once when the companies applied for emergency authorization and are now analyzing it
23633,[removed]
23634,Moderna is (very slightly) less effective and has more side effects.
23635,The only thing it's better at is not requiring a cold chain.
23636,"Ultimately the J&amp;J single shot vaccine will be better than both, we just can't wait another year to get this stupid pandemic over with."
23637,So wait - the Pfizer execs aren't willing to inject themselves with the same thing they have their company inject their test subjects with?
23638,They could easily put themselves on the list of vaccine testers.
23639,"So I guess they want to try it out on other people before doing it to themselves, huh?"
23640,Makes sense :)
23641,I can't wait to see what the threads will look like.
23642,Joe Mercola and Robert F. Kennedy Jr. are well-known anti-vax quacks.
23643,Yep.
23644,If you tell people to not have a Christmas gathering they almost certainly aren’t going to listen.
23645,"And on the other hand you have politicians telling people not to travel, not to gather, but then they themselves or a spouse do it right after anyway, no wonder people don’t want to listen anymore"
23646,Hi!
23647,Now you know 4.
23648,"True, but we also didn't have evidence for infection via aerosolized Covid until very recently, but now it's accepted that under the right conditions it can happen."
23649,A few months ago were you saying it's impossible for Covid to aerosolize because there was no evidence for it?
23650,Another thing I think about is the fact that people get GI symptoms due to Covid -- isn't it possible that it's a GI route of infection?
23651,"And finally, the food reheating can also help get rid of germs that DO transmit via fomites, such as flu or the 160 rhinoviruses that cause common colds, plus various food borne pathogens."
23652,I don't feel like getting sick with anything during the pandemic.
23653,"I am not overboard, I don't wear gloves, don't wear kleenex boxes on my feet, and I do walk around touching commonly touched surfaces such as door handles and elevator buttons."
23654,But I avoid touching my face and wash my hands thoroughly with soap before eating anything.
23655,"It's a cute little tool, nothing to fancy; but the underlying statistical methods are solid."
23656,I only wish that It allowed for a wider audience (i.e.
23657,those under 65).
23658,"boss won't listen if one guy squawks, but he's got to listen if the union talks"
23659,I just thought of it while considering if I would accept the vaccine when offered.
23660,We got an email at work regarding vaccine availability to us coming soon (I’m an RN).
23661,I think prior to reading that e-mail I was having another unrelated conversation with a colleague (RN) and she had mentioned having antibodies.
23662,"I guess I think a lot about how many of us have antibodies/have been infected, lack of testing, and about if I’d be excited to take the first round of a new, rapidly developed, emergency approved vaccine."
23663,Headline is slightly misleading.
23664,This is after approval in UK.
23665,Thousands have already received the Pfizer vaccine.
23666,Of course this headline was done to draw the eyeballs and clicks
23667,"It’s funny how pretty much EVERYONE, regardless of their opinions about the virus/restrictions, recognizes that walking through a restaurant with a mask on only to sit down and take your mask off for an hour and a half is absolutely ridiculous."
23668,"The difference is that people who think covid is “no big deal” think that means there’s no point in wearing a mask in restaurants at all, and people who recognize the situation think it shows you shouldn’t eat indoors at all."
23669,There are two worlds that people are living in.
23670,It isn’t pessimism.
23671,These numbers are baked in the cake.
23672,High risk groups are being vaccinated this winter.
23673,Then it is given to the next group.
23674,"Yeah, people in their mid-20s will be last."
23675,"But if people act like assholes and refuse the vaccine, that could be earlier than next summer."
23676,I know I sound like I’m talking out of my ass.
23677,But listen to Michael Osterholm’s podcast.
23678,I’m not saying anything he hasn’t said a hundred times.
23679,"Birx, Sunday, said this winter will not be the greatest public health tragedy in American history."
23680,She said it will be the worst event our country has faced.
23681,I don’t think people quite understand the gravity of what’s coming at us.
23682,Hospitals are already rationing care.
23683,People WILL die needlessly this winter.
23684,This is known to anyone who is actually listening.
23685,But we still have control over some of it.
23686,We can stop the spread.
23687,The vaccine WILL NOT save us from the next few months.
23688,It cannot be distributed fast enough.
23689,This isn’t pessimism.
23690,This is math.
23691,"&gt; It's the opinion of almost every medical professional out there, including the world's leading infectious disease experts

Can you find some sources saying that you should get the vaccine if you've already had covid?"
23692,I'd be interested in reading them.
23693,We're going to burn through the available vaccine in very short order - and then have to wait until midyear 2021 for more.
23694,Thanks to Donald Trump for refusing to buy more when we were offered.
23695,So much winning!
23696,Oh no!
23697,Anyway....
23698,We talk about it and there is a remembrance day for it.
23699,Look we still talk about 9/11 its been almost 20 years.
23700,So would you call December the climax?
23701,Yeah that’s where my ideas are founded.
23702,Can’t fix stupid.
23703,It’s that combined with the political war on all things science.
23704,I really doubt this will ever go away.
23705,"Even if it got so bad that the next admin needed to mandate it, the tracks have already been laid for the idiots to react violently due to Bill gates trying to microchip them."
23706,There is some evidence that even the remaining 30% are protected against severe cases.
23707,"From the outset, they estimated 18 months for a vaccine."
23708,I was fine to wait that long.
23709,I might have considered going back to playing earlier if there was a lull in cases and everyone wore masks and took other precautions.
23710,I just feel like there are other ways to get exercise/sunshine/social interaction that don’t involve people breathing heavily within a couple feet of me.
23711,Where are all the game changer discoveries that we have been hearing about since mid summer?
23712,One would think these things would be rushed into production.
23713,"""Sorry we infected you!"
23714,"Here is some vaccine!"""
23715,Great diplomacy.
23716,"Ugh, yes it is."
23717,Fixed that thanks.
23718,"Well, I hope they don't get them mixed up."
23719,Can’t see how that would be an issue.
23720,Bigger problem would be young grads (or anyone) who are unemployed or underemployed throughout the pandemic (and possibly afterwards....remains to be see how the economy will recover).
23721,Talk to me like I’m a baby.
23722,How can you spread the virus if you are vaccinated?
23723,"Nope, didn't learn a thing."
23724,"I'm still slightly surprised by one crazy bonehead move after another, then I remember who we're dealing with, and I laugh at myself for being foolish!"
23725,&gt; I've been riddled with anxiety lately and have been afraid of just about any encounter with anyone in any capacity.
23726,This is so sad to read but you are definitely not alone.
23727,Try to focus on your mental health.
23728,Did you read my comment above?
23729,I don’t need to stay at home.
23730,No community transmission in my whole country.
23731,No need to stay home.
23732,No restrictions.
23733,WOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
23734,"Yeah, I can’t fully explain it."
23735,"Maybe in the times before antibiotics and really effective treatments for illness people kind of just saw it as an act of god, shrugged and moved on."
23736,"This was a time where malaria still existed in the south, for instance."
23737,"Polio was very present, and Disease and death at a young age was just kind of there still, albeit not as bad as it was before indoor plumbing with things like Cholera, but still it wasn’t great."
23738,"People remember wars and struggles and heroes, they don’t always remember disease unless it’s something like the bubonic plague and just straight up wipes everything out."
23739,"Lol, yeah that pretty much sums it up."
23740,At least it’s honest right?
23741,I’m curious what all the concerned citizens will do to prevent deaths generally when this is over?
23742,"Now that we’ve determined the devastating lengths we’ll go to extend the end of life, that should continue right?"
23743,"If you're an alcoholic who hasn't drunk yourself to death yet, you're probably young enough that COVID is unpleasant rather than fatal."
23744,So you either don't get the vaccine or keep drinking anyway.
23745," You don't actually think they spend $20,000 on a hammer, $30,000 on a toilet seat, do you?"
23746,\-Julius
23747,I’m not looking to the government to tell me what to do.
23748,I’m listening to doctors and making my own decisions based on being considerate of others and protecting my family.
23749,It is my personal responsibility to do so.
23750,"Honestly this goes beyond ""people are dumb selfish assholes""."
23751,Something about how this is being done is screwed up.
23752,"Not sure it's what questions are being asked, if the callers are rude or what but they need to reexamine how they are conducting these calls."
23753,"Simply saying ""people bad"" over and over again is not going to change anything."
23754,Isn't timeline the biggest issue though?
23755,"We could buy a billion doses from a manufacturer, but getting them in Q3 2021 makes them worthless compared to a million doses we can get in Q2."
23756,Seems we were penny wise and pound foolish and will pay the price.
23757,"Yes, these articles are going to be a problem."
23758,I can already see a slew of people not receiving the second dose because they think it’s one and done and good enough.
23759,Then we’re going to have problems.
23760,Again.
23761,"Ford is walking the fine line between controlling the infection, and decimating Ontario's economy."

23765,"It's AP, they release bits of news like that all the time and then come back to write a longer article."
23766,You can't control other people.
23767,Best you can do is create healthy boundaries regarding what you're personally comfortable with doing.
23768,"I normally avoid vaccines, was raised in a family that treats it that way as well, and I will be getting this vaccine."
23769,"My original plan was to wait it out and see how the vaccine program was going, I still will wait a bit (sorry, can’t help it) to see which one I will try and get access to based on reports, but I can say that what I’ve been hearing about both the moderna and Pfizer vaccine makes me feel like I will be getting this vaccine sooner than I thought."
23770,Yes?
23771,"Cool, you can stay home then."
23772,There's no need for you to try and control my actions.
23773,Worry about yourself and I'll worry about myself.
23774,I put a USA flair on it.
23775,Showing $48k as a lower middle class income in the states.
23776,Don't spread misinformation.
23777,We don't know if immunity is sterilizing or not.
23778,"I completely accept it, what I don’t accept is these “leaders” dictating that choice for us"
23779,Thats just not true.
23780,They fared well in the trials
23781,People should be doing that anyways!
23782,Personally I think they should have first dibs on the vaccine.
23783,They put themselves on the line in order to prove its safe.
23784,let them reap the rewards by getting part of the first batch of available vaccines.
23785,"“A simple glass of champagne never hurt anyone”

Sod champagne they will be getting wild on vodka over the festive period..."
23786,Just being realistic after reviewing the studies...
23787,I think we can both recognize that an online study of ~650 people really doesn’t scale up at all.
23788,And a global study really doesn’t help with any assurance of what’s going to happen in the USA.
23789,I don’t mean to refute these for no reason.
23790,I’m just seriously skeptical that we’ll ever get past this considering the societal war against all things science.
23791,"Wearing a mask DOES protect you, just not 100%."
23792,"When I’m around anyone where I can’t social distance, I wear a surgical mask with a cloth mask with a 2.5pm filter in it over top."
23793,But I’ve only worn that for about an hour at a time at most.

23823,What about pregnancies and ability to have kids for both men and women?
23824,There is absolutely no reporting on this.
23825,&gt;Hopefully another 10% get on board in the next few months.
23826,We are going to receive a vaccination card with the vaccine.
23827,"My guess is that many businesses including airlines, schools, etc will require vaccination."
23828,"There will be huge pushback initially, and then I think we'll get to our 70%."
23829,"There is going to be a chunk of the population who will use medical/religious exemptions to get around that requirement, but that will be a small portion"
23830,Also it can be fatal to abruptly stop drinking alcohol if you drink heavily every day.
23831,So this is going to be super problematic for a lot of people.
23832,I know you are being sarcastic but their predictions have been some of the worst during this pandemic.
23833,Plenty of other websites did a better job.
23834,Covid19-projections.com has been one of the better ones I have seen.
23835,I'll wear a mask as long as it's recommended by the CDC.
23836,"Especially since (at least right now), only 55% of Americans say they plan on getting the vaccine."
23837,"I hope that changes but it seems that for awhile, the virus will continue to circulate."
23838,Alcoholism among Russian men was so bad at one point in the 90s that there was a whopping 13-year gap in the life expectancy between men and women.
23839,There is still a noticeable imbalance between the numbers of men and women in Russia because of it.
23840,"So in conclusion, you mixed me up with another guy."

23844,We have pediatric surgeons at my hospital who don’t technically “deal with COVID” but they are opening up kids and get paid 7-figure salaries.
23845,They already test every kid and accompanying family member before surgery to ensure none of them endanger the staff.
23846,So yeah.
23847,"Those surgeons and that staff, nurses, anesthesiologists, physicians assistants, and on down the line will get the vaccine."
23848,The kids’ pediatrician who deals with runny noses all winter will get the vaccine.
23849,The nurse practitioner at Kroger who deals with sore throats and coughs all winter will get the vaccine.
23850,"Once you start identifying the MDs and staff who actually are at personal risk, the number gets pretty big."
23851,"And yeah, we have a moral obligation to protect them."
23852,The future.
23853,The common sense that more than 10 people might be a bad idea?
23854,"Because as you can see in this thread, one persons common sense is another person’s unreasonable restriction."
23855,Ya but Becky on Facebook said there’s no way they can come up with a safe vaccine this quick!
23856,"Unfortunately, since there's nowhere near enough to go around, most Americans won't be getting the Pfizer vaccine...."
23857,Ever.
23858,I'm luckily in the position that I can afford it.
23859,"Had this been eight years ago, I'd have been in big trouble paying $1450 a month with no money coming in."

23868,"The vaccines are too little, too late."
23869,"Come to the final stage of grief, acceptance, let go of anger, let go of anxiety."

23871,"If that's the case won't it stunt its ability to reproduce, and thus stunt the ability to spread?"
23872,We don't know what backroom deal Trudeau made to get those initial vaccines early.
23873,His government is refusing to allow any audits by the opposition.
23874,Probably tossed another $Billion in the fire to save face.

23884,The amount of anti-vaccers in the U.S. should speed up this timetable.
23885,Before long they'll be collecting dust on the shelves.
23886,Then just accept there is a chance you get it and spread it to someone in your family that ends up in the hospital.
23887,This chance rises the more people are at your gathering.

23900,We should be wearing masks during regular cold and flu seasons if you’re even remotely symptomatic.
23901,This should be common sense.
23902,Yay!
23903,"Wait...

We didn't buy enough doses for everyone???"
23904,Fucking figures.

23907,If I can find it.
23908,"""This is Dr.  Michael Yeadon Former Chief Scientific Advisor to Pfizer and Pulmonologist Dr. Wolfgang Wodarg

 Coronavirus vaccines, according to mRNA technology, contain a spike protein that the virus uses to bind to the cells it infects."
23909,This protein is analogous to syncytin (Syncytin-1).
23910,"MRNA vaccines (Moderna, Pfizer-BioNTech, etc.)"
23911,inject a small portion of coronavirus mRNA that contains the protein code it uses to attach to the body's cells.
23912,The vaccine creates those conditions so that the body makes this protein and then in turn proceeds with the process of making antibodies.
23913,The problem is that such a spike protein is also syncytine.
23914,"In 2000, American researchers discovered that this protein, which is of viral origin and is present in all mammals, is necessary for the formation of the placenta."
23915,.
23916,"According to the two scientists, if the body learns to produce antibodies to the coronavirus proteins, it will eventually learn to produce antibodies to syncytin (* for some reason it was translated cocytin) as well."
23917,"Such a possibility will result in not only the termination of the pregnancy, but also the inability to do so."
23918,"""Vaccines are expected to produce antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 protein spikes."
23919,"However, spike proteins contain similar characteristics to homologous syncytial proteins, which are necessary for placenta formation in mammals such as humans."
23920,"""It must be completely ruled out that a SARS-CoV-2 vaccine could trigger an immune response to syncytine-1, as otherwise vaccinated women could lead to indefinite infertility,"" the two experts said."
23921,"Although such a possibility is considered remote, however, if the vaccines are not tested in the long run to determine the antibody relationship between the pin proteins and the syncytine, then there is a specific risk in their use."""
23922,And that's all.
23923,Yeah you too fuckboy
23924,Used to work with someone who had 9 siblings.
23925,"Mormons, man."

23930,"https://www.reuters.com/article/health-coronavirus-astrazeneca-insight-i-idUSKBN28D2AM

I agree with scientists that say they need to repeat the trial and gather more data before this vaccine can be approved."
23931,"Yep, reservations mean nothing if we're at the bottom of the list."
23932,"Trudeau spent way too much time courting the Chinese for their vaccine, which ultimately fell apart for political reasons (big surprise)"
23933,I do.
23934,My point is that people should use common sense instead of relying on public administration for guidance
23935,Ya can’t you read the BBC version
23936,There’s actually no proof of permanent damage because it only been around for a yr.  my kids leading normal lives is important to me and them.

23941,Its not a pretty sight.
23942,If it doesn’t prevent crabgrass and acne as well I don’t want it!
23943,No plenty of people that young die of the flu every year.
23944,Actually the flu is roughly as deadly for 20-30 year olds as the flu is I believe.
23945,Ofc covid overall is much more dangerous
23946,Why does it matter if it's not an analysis of the 1000 pages?
23947,The FDA already pored over that information and condensed that into the given document.
23948,"I mean, if you won't take the FDA's word for it, then I don't know what to say, then."
23949,It only sounds unbelievable because the thresholds for overweight and obese are lower than people think.
23950,"I remember being told all the time ""sure you're a little chubby, but you're not *obese*"" when I very much was medically obese lol"
23951,The current China vaccine costs $60 a dose.
23952,That is considerably more expensive than the other ones.
23953,The Astra Zeneca one is $3 and being sold at cost.
23954,The Moderna one is $39.
23955,"I don’t expect others to wear a mask after they’ve been vaccinated, but I will choose to do so for others anyway."
23956,It’s the people who won’t wear a mask pre-vaccine that get under my skin.
23957,"But I can see why my original comment is confusing, so I’ll delete it."
23958,"Its high, but considering the facts, it's not that suspicious."
23959,"1 in 1000 of us has died fron the virus, and that's not even mentioning the hospitalized."
23960,"Its not really that hard to believe that of you randomly polled African Americans, at least 3 in 4 would know  someone."

23963,"And we are people who are relatively well off, who don't have to work and get exposed."
23964,I can only imagine that the devastation in poorer black communities is more widespread.
23965,"Well I don’t know which articles you were reading, but the ones I read even back in May quoted medical professionals saying that the virus is here to stay in the US, that we’ll need to do off and on restrictions until there is a vaccine, and that the vaccine wouldn’t be an immediate fix to return to pre Covid normalcy."
23966,I didn’t just imagine this.
23967,I'm sorry to hear about your brother.
23968,"People tend to overlook children being a risk group, they can be immunocompromised as well."
23969,I feel bad for parents that might not have options if schools reopen and there isn't any online teaching.
23970,"Wear a mask when you’re symptomatic so you don’t get others sick, and by them wearing masks, you don’t get sick."
23971,"That concept is difficult for you to understand, I’m seeing."
23972,It’s okay.
23973,what does 70% mean?
23974,"Is it that 70% of people can't get covid or that the same amount can catch it but will now be 70% ""less sick""?"
23975,Where did I say otherwise?
23976,I was referring to Pfizer and the moon landing
23977,Yeah I mean I’m not happy with my hospitals administration right now.
23978,Over the course of the last couple of years I’ve seen most of all my benefits fly out the window.
23979,But I’ll always do more for my patients.
23980,This is extraordinary times and I’m proud of the difference I make.
23981,I’d rather say at the end of my days that I tried to do everything I could to make the world a better place.
23982,"Also, why do we always cite WAPO?"
23983,I don’t know anybody who is willing to pay to read WAPO
23984,I have seen some bad interactions (in both directions) between mask wearers and non wearers or improperly wearing mask wearers.

Anti vaccine people and anti mask wearers maybe the same, but more often they are not."
23992,"It depends on the reason, and for most people it is not based on who they voted for president."
23993,I think Pfizer said they have a shortage of raw materials and may struggle to even meet the orders they have signed atm.
23994,Overweight or obese.
23995,It’s 1/3 and 1/3.
23996,Okay so just going off the wording of the title and the point the article is making...
23997,"If the new vaccines **probably** prevent you from getting sick, and if it's unknown if they prevent the spread of the virus, and **if** you're still recommended to wear a mask and social distance after getting the vaccine anyways...

Why rush to get the vaccine?"
23998,I know.
23999,"A real feel-good story would be ""7-year-old finds lost dog, returns it to owner"" not ""7-year-old has to keep professional medical workers from dying because the government is too inept to do it"""

24015,My symptoms are cough severe sore throat with a lot of phlegm.
24016,O2 is 96 and it was 99 5 days ago.
24017,If I’m sick should I still get the vaccine.
24018,Russia is doomed.
24019,Dumbass headline.
24020,"Once vaccines are widespread, what are teachers going to use as an excuse to avoid  going back to work?"
24021,"Actually there is, we've been studying mRNA for a while now."

24023,Vaccines aren't a black box.

24359,Sample size is too small to have confidence in that data.
24360,Also only 18-55 age group was included.
24361,So how will I apply with two or more pre-existing conditions?

24390,Maybe they genuinely didn't understand.
24391,Maybe the last time they asked they were genuinely uncertain and the only person who would talk to them was an antivaxxer.
24392,Maybe by engaging we can change a few minds.

24436,"It *is* news that Trump's administration had the ability to get more at one point and chose not to, but that doesn't really have any effect on the dosage numbers that have been announced and which we have been operating from this entire time."
24437,Pfizer said 100 million doses and that's what we're getting.
24438,&gt; How do I get the app?
24439,I assume it's not released yet since vaccines haven't started going around widely yet?
24440,(Can't read article to check.)
24441,"No, the problem is Oxford doesn't even know what dose to use."
24442,The group with the half dose is way too small to actually make a determination
24443,I mean what else are you supposed to do?
24444,Mourn every death as they come?
24445,"You don’t sound heartless, the human brain is not designed to process this amount of tragedy at once."
24446,"I don’t know anyone who’s died, one close friend caught it and went to the ER, but he’s made a full recovery."
24447,Excellent news
24448,Bootstraps yo

24455,"&gt; Your point stands of course, but if we're being precise: if you're in an ICU bed, you're well past the point of having any input in what care you get."
24456,"One ventilator suck for ""yes"", two ventilator sucks for ""no""."
24457,The United States did purchase 100 million doses with the option to get 500 million more.
24458,"You’re right, he did pass up a previous offer and I’m not sure if that option can only be exercised after every other country receives their orders, but eventually we will get millions and millions of doses."

24463,Asian and SOME african countries comply with vaccination events.
24464,The rest of the world has a 20-30% antivaxx population.
24465,Most notably being the US at 45%(before covid) and Ukraine having the lowest vaccination rates in Europe.
24466,i call bullshit.
24467,you can't even get a consensus in this tiny subreddit.
24468,who in any of the big companies want to start this conversation let alone passing the fucking rule lol?

24484,I've been doing carryout like crazy but still no restaurant dining for me yet.
24485,"Consider addressing that despite mRNA vaccine technology being 30 years old, it has never before produced a successful vaccine, though this one appears to be."
24486,We also have zero long term studies.
24487,Phase 3 lasted from late July to November.
24488,When this pandemic ends we are going to see such a pent up demand for big must-see-in-theaters movies.
24489,And I don’t think there are that many movies that one really must see in theaters aside from Dune.
24490,So the competition will be nil.
24491,And I think with the vaccine coming out this pandemic will end a lot sooner than we realize.
24492,"The UK, Great Britain and England are all sort of one and the same."
24493,"Agree with the other commenter, get anxiety meds."
24494,"But also, I have seen zero indication that it will be mandatory"
24495,You do understand the common cold isn’t just a single strain of coronavirus?
24496,You do understand that there is a thing called PREP that greatly reduces your chance of contracting HIV?
24497,You do understand that people can pretty much live with HIV with minimal impacts with the right treatments?
24498,Didn’t thinks so...
24499,Operation Warp Speed has been planning how to roll out the virus this entire time.
24500,Chill.
24501,That's a very important question.
24502,"For Astrazeneca, though the infection rate was higher (for only 70% efficacy), not a single vaccinated person had a severe case."
24503,"It also seems to reduce viral shedding, so you'll tend not to infect others."
24504,That's why nobody is really disappointed in the 70% number.
24505,"I read that not a single Moderna-vaccinated individual had a severe case, but I could be wrong."
24506,No link.
24507,"Plus, the statistics for that would be low, since only 11 people contracted it at all (depending on their definition of contracted)."
24508,[deleted]
24509,"“The infectious disease expert, who will remain in a similar position next year as an advisor to President-elect Joe Biden on Covid, said it’s likely there should be enough doses of vaccine available for all Americans beginning in late March and early April.”

This is really good news"
24510,Rhetoric is more important than results for some people.
24511,😂😂😂
24512,Thank you!
24513,I like baker
24514,ok. that is your prerogative.
24515,I have other things to do than hang out on reddit.
24516,My source is the CDC.
24517,"I am hesitant to provide a link, because the data is RAW and easily manipulated and misunderstood and you can drown in it."
24518,So I am using death data (and you will see - the link of current cases does not add up).
24519,"At this point the death is the ""best"" data, and it is a major component to what the CDC users to extrapolate FLU cases in hind site, ie we had 70K flu cases last year."
24520,"So you can lookup ""CDC weekly death rate by state""   It will allow you to download all of 2019 and 2020 data to date."
24521,Here is why I do not recommend looking at the data.
24522,the data becomes accurate over time.
24523,"The reporting in not instant, but data from 8 weeks ago it is reasonably accurate."
24524,"&amp;#x200B;

So download it (this is one example)."
24525,"Look at week 30,31,32 for 2019 (yes it is summer) but why is FLU higher in 2020 than 2019."
24526,There are other patterns.
24527,"&amp;#x200B;

My other data sources are similar."
24528,Hopefully this will show you I am legit.
24529,"I will never provide a link to someone elses ""massaged"" data in a pretty table or graph."
24530,See Carl Sagan Bologna detection.
24531,"&amp;#x200B;

So if you make the argument of not to use deaths."
24532,Cases = deaths.
24533,It is a constant ratio.
24534,"You can again, get raw data of deaths going back many years and compare ""cases"" to deaths."
24535,The ratio is pretty consistent.
24536,(starting to see why I didn't share the info.
24537,It is raw data.
24538,it is real.
24539,You will be lost in data.
24540,If you look at the data.
24541,H1N1 (aka swine flu) is the only time that the ratio goes askew.

24547,Everything about this year and end of last year seems suspect.
24548,We had a friend's dad die suddenly between christmas and new years.
24549,Diagnosed with broncitis and was on antibiotics for it and then had a really hard time breathing and then just died.
24550,Part of me knows people die from breathing issues all the time (and I also had pneumonia in late sept last year and had a relatively easy time with and I've heard plenty of horror stories from that also) so I'm mostly convinced that what it was...mostly.
24551,"The article makes two fairly contradictory statements

""""The efficacy of the vaccine after the first dose is about 52 percent, according to Dr. William C. Gruber, senior vice president of Pfizer Vaccine Clinical Research and Development""

AND

""""""New coronavirus cases quickly tapered off in the vaccinated group of volunteers about 10 days after the first dose, according to one graph in the briefing materials."
24552,"In the placebo group, cases kept steadily increasing."""""
24553,2nd statement strongly implies efficacy more than 52%.
24554,"From the peer reviewed efficacy data published today on the Oxford/AZ vaccine:

there were ten cases hospitalised for COVID-19, all in the control arm; two were classified as severe COVID-19,

&gt;One worry people have is if there will be long-term side effects of a COVID vaccine, months or years down the road."

Fuller said the chances of long-term complications are extremely unlikely because of how vaccines work."
24642,"“**Most of their job is done in the first few days, then the vaccine is gone from your body**."

24684,I said it an different post and got downvoted for it but this executive order infuriates me!
24685,This is not an American/Pfizer- Vaccine!
24686,It is developed in Germany with funding from the EU and Germany.
24687,It was possible to develop this fast because of the swift decode of the virus-Genom by Chinese scientist.
24688,"It’s ingredients are produced all over the world, for example Denmark, Belgium, USA and many more."
24689,Pfizer helped with the approval Prozess and is a huge help producing this vaccine.
24690,All of these vaccines are international cooperation!
24691,It’s not an only US achievement at all!
24692,The current US-Administration torpedoed a lot of Scientific cooperation in the last four years and treated his closest partners like ...
24693,I am proud of the international achievement and can’t stand it any more that some countries act like they invented the wheel al by themself!
24694,I understand that and it very well maybe was the flu that got her.
24695,Just the timing of it compounded by the fact that it was the first time I had personally heard of anyone my age die from the flu had me thinking.
24696,And it’s not like I don’t see death regularly; I have worked in pathology for the past 10 years and have been involved in over 500 autopsies.
24697,None of them have been for a 30ish year old who died from the flu.
24698,"All anecdotal, sure, but just made me think."
24699,"&gt;It also significantly reduces the ""viral load"" or ""infective dose"" which potentially can lead to a less severe disease due to small viral load."
24700,Nobody takes that into account really.

24721,"If they choose not to take the vaccine, then they only harm themselves and other ant-vax idiots around them."
24722,"Or maybe because of vitamin D deficiencies, from darker skin which absorbs less anyway combined with a weaker winter sun."
24723,Key word enough people are vaccinated.
24724,Vaccine is new political divide
24725,So 2022 or later.
24726,And there's usually like 6 cash registers with only one open and it's never the one I choose.
24727,Sorry I just had the Pfizer injected a few hours ago and now my brain is melting
24728,"Please correct me if I am wrong, but my understanding is that the current main focus is on developing an adult vaccine for the virus."
24729,"The children vaccine, though in the works, will take longer to become available."
24730,This is partially due to the observation that adults have more adverse reactions to the virus as well as the fact that the development of children vaccines require more rigorous safety measures.
24731,"Now, I’ve seen a lot of comments saying “I’m young and healthy, I’ll be in the last group to get the vaccine, so once that happens suck it to wearing masks.”  Though these comments are correct in the way that these people will be the last group to be vaccinated, that is only true for the adult vaccine."
24732,It is likely that it will take even longer for children to become vaccinated.
24733,My understanding of the above post is that masks are asked to be retained for the same reason we wear them in the first place: a safety measure.
24734,There are (currently) no conclusive studies about whether a vaccinated individual can spread the virus to an unvaccinated individual.
24735,"As such, it is of interest for people to continue wearing their masks even after being immunized until more studies can be done or the vast majority receive access to a vaccine."
24736,I should have invested in Pfizer after the Moderna announcement.
24737,"Oh well, now I’m invested in J&amp;J let’s gooooo!"
24738,If the government doesn't reimburse them then I'm fine with that.
24739,"But if so, I would love to donate to a cause to help make it free for communities who have trouble getting the vaccine if it is going to cost money."
24740,"No, considering it was not common sense for every flu season before covid."
24741,"You are welcome to continue wearing them after all this is over, but don’t expect the general public to."

24743,Sounds like someone knows their neighbours well enough by now.
24744,It will stop community spread because in most countries 10-20% of people have had the virus (and so are immune).
24745,It might still show up.
24746,"Question is, what do you plan to do with the information?"
24747,Because it doesn’t mean you’re immunized now against covid.
24748,Why would a conservative president go down this road?
24749,This subreddit is performance art at this point.
24750,So will one still feel sick at all after getting this one?

24752,Ayyy perfect timing for when Biden takes office and the left can give him credit for it when in reality he's done nothing for it at that point.
24753,👌🏼
24754,"Yes, I have a feeling they’ll end up giving this one (easier to produce) to the majority of lower risk people, and the Pfizer and Moderna ones to the high risk."
24755,The goal here is to create a herd immunity using vaccines while protecting the most vulnerable - this strategy does that
24756,"I feel like we should take the approach Japan does, once the vaccine is widely available."
24757,Business as usual mostly but wear a mask if you feel sick to prevent spreading *whatever* to other people.
24758,And then run for President.
24759,"Yeah, my boss is a highly-educated black woman who diligently wears a mask, but she plans to skip getting the vaccine =/"
24760,I honestly wish there could just be a full divide and have Trump country on one side and rational people who follow medical advice on the other.

24772,Nobody's going to jail.
24773,And I'm sure there's no malicious intent.
24774,Any company can make mistakes or be too close to the project and not see beyond their narrow focus.
24775,I don't doubt the UK did their due diligence and followed their protocols.
24776,"Every nations agency protocols are there for a reason, I'm sure they're similar but some more thorough in some respects than others."
24777,"It also comes down to what data is required and if the company has that data readily available to provide, and may take longer to digest."
24778,Isn’t that what some people on this subreddit were advocating for?
24779,Facebook lol
24780,The fastest way this can have an impact is the vaccine keeps the healthcare professionals healthy so that hospitals can keep running.
24781,That way covid and non-covid emergency patients still get treated.
24782,What will they do with all those potatoes?
24783,"“As of Tuesday, Dec. 8, a total of 510,018 (+25,721) cases have been reported in Ohio since the pandemic began, leading to 7,103 (+81) deaths and 30,226 (+657) hospitalizations."
24784,"Tuesday’s numbers include 12,600 positive tests that were backlogged in the Ohio Department of Health’s system.”

So almost 13,000 actual new cases reported today along with 657 new hospitalizations."
24785,Unreal.
24786,"Because stress, and bills, and alcohol, and drugs."
24787,In that order.
24788,"Like all laws with a number attached, it’s arbitrary to some degree (“Why is the speed limit in a school zone 20?"
24789,Why not 21?
24790,Or 22?” Etc).
24791,Unfortunately we are also going to see unrest and violence over science.
24792,I’m not sure this is as malicious as you’re making it sound.
24793,"The company they hired to administer the trial vaccines accidentally gave 3,000 of the 21,000 participants a half does."
24794,"Within a fortnight, the company informed Astra, to which they decided to continue the trial with the 3,000 people just to see if it would have any affect."
24795,This all happened in July.
24796,"Astra isn’t reporting that the vaccine is 90% effective, they don’t even recommend that the half dose method be used, they’re just stating a plane fact that the vaccine trial showed that in some cases the vaccine was UP TO 90% effective."
24797,Which is completely true.
24798,"They’re running another study to see if the half dose method is safe and effective, by there own admission they don’t have enough data on that method yet, and until then people will get the full dose method."
24799,"The fuck up in July didn’t affect the data from the rest of the participants, so this was handled as best as it could have been, and didn’t compromise the entire trial."
24800,The two commentators above you seem to be supportive of dictatorship.

24814,"Because the fact is what’s happening this moment is a tragedy, covid is now the number 1 killer of Americans and we’ve no immediate plans to control it."
24815,"We have vaccines coming, but nothing is stoping it right this moment."
24816,The technology it's based on is what arguably makes it very safe and effective.
24817,Reverse engineering mRNA from a specific protein and targeting it means it's unique and specific without causing any immune over-reactivity issues.
24818,The only risks would be tied on what else is in the vial.
24819,Thank you for your post.

24829,The vaccine should not change behavior until enough people have been vaccinated.
24830,"The vaccine is 95% effective after two doses, so there's a chance that you are within the 5%."
24831,Even if you get a milder case because you've been vaccinated you can still spread it to other people.
24832,"&gt;""I would be concerned about any nurse who didn't have a critical care background to be able to independently function after two days of orientation,"" said Dale Beatty."
24833,"While the sound bite from Newsom doesn't have much detail, I'd be shocked if he's suggesting they function independently after this crash course."
24834,"However, if these nurses can absorb some small percentage of the individual tasks then it increases the capacity of the fully-trained critical-care nurses."

24917,"Can confirm, work in a hospital and the nursing staff will come around to each ward and office offering a flu jab."
24918,You’re not forced to get it but it is highly encouraged since (as I understand it) the lower viral load you carry around while infected post-vaccination poses significantly less risk to vulnerable people who may develop pneumonia from a cold that barely affects healthy people.
24919,"I imagine the covid vaccine is following a similar protocol, I know some staff in my hospital are a little skeptical about getting it straight away but I’m extremely optimistic that the country will be allowed to open up again gradually as the vaccine rolls out!"

The washington post article doesn't mention it because those deaths aren't related to the safety of the vaccine and would only feed irrational antivax paranoia."

* Some death certificates give multiple causes, some people are considered members of multiple races."
25025,"* If you now group the numbers by cause or race, one death may show up in multiple entries."

25030,"I'm not against it exactly, but I would've thought they would focus the vaccinations more on the middle-aged to moderately elderly than people over 80."
25031,I get they're at higher risk but acknowledging QALY it seems like more value would be in vaccinating people equally at risk but younger.
25032,Out of sight - out of mind.
25033,More like out of their mind.
25034,"Unfortunately I moved a few years ago after my wife passed, I have two young kids, my step dad passed shortly after my wife, so I had my mom move in with me, so I have no parents to move in with, LOL."
25035,"My mom can barely manage herself let alone my kids, so I'm kinda stuck until school is back in session in person, hoping I can get a job enough to pay the bills, otherwise I'm going to have to downgrade my home, or even live in an apartment (especially if I don't have a steady job by then)."
25036,"With me and my kids and my mom living together, that will be rough."
25037,Right now my house is big enough my mom and I can have separate living areas more or less so we can have our privacy.
25038,But that may be a luxury I can't afford any more.

25048,It is a good thing for humanity that most people still trust science.
25049,Some people always had goodwill towards the USPS...
25050,Ain't that the truth.
25051,And don't forget it's at it's most dangerous after 9pm so everything needs to close early.
25052,The first recipients of the vaccine will all be old people and those develop weird medical conditions all the time.
25053,"If there's any side effect of the vaccine that is so rare that it didn't occur during the trials, it's unlikely to stand out among a group of elderly recipients."
25054,He still got a bit of recognition at least.
25055,Certainly more than if he was called John Smith.
25056,Optics.
25057,That’s not that long ago historically speaking.
25058,After the American revolution most of the loyalists went to Canada.
25059,"I get that not all Canadians are descended from loyalists but those are the values that their government and culture was founded on, sucking up to Britain and being better than America who rebelled against the British."
25060,Even today many Canadians think that their country is better than America and vice versa.

25068,"My wife’s work is in person every day, and the rule is they have to wear masks only when away from their desk."
25069,So the cubicles don’t matter.
25070,The shared air for fifty hours is fine because they wear a mask to go to the bathroom.
25071,"/s 

My wife wears a self protective mask 100% of the time."
25072,She also has a large HEPA air purifier in her cube.
25073,"My friend wears a cowboy hat, does that count?"
25074,One of the most exciting things about the mRNA vaccines is that they can be developed so quickly.
25075,"Pfizer had them made since March, the rest was just waiting for data."
25076,"If this happens again, we would probably use human challenge trials so that the data can be generated in weeks rather than months."
25077,"&gt;There’s a fair amount of belief that this is endemic and you’ll likely need to stay up on covid vaccines for the rest of your life, this virus is now part of the world generally like influenza."
25078,I've heard the opposite.
25079,Covid has been far slower to mutate than the common flu.
25080,So a vaccine will have a better chance of eradicating it.
25081,Or at least damn near.
25082,The flu is still around because it's a different flu every season.
25083,Spare a thought for William Shakespeare (not the original) who fulfilled the Buzz Aldrin role of being the second person to be vaccinated today.
25084,Would have made a much better headline.
25085,"Lol, my reply was automodded."
25086,"There's probably something profound in that...

What I initially replied essentially was that you absolutely can break the rules of a game in real life."
25087,"You'll either create a new, different game (see political debates featuring HRC and DJT in which a pigeon destroys a chess board and his opponent carries on trying to move knight to queen 3) or you'll discover these rules are not absolute and can be bent, stretched, folded and straight up broken every which way from Sunday."
25088,Often whilst someone watches and tells you 'you can't do that'.
25089,That this is the case can be observed just from the state of the world as is.
25090,If rule breaking *mattered* the last 20 years would have a lot more white collar prisoners in the States and UK.

25095,You can always choose to break the rules of the game.
25096,But oftentimes you shouldn't choose that
25097,You'll likely get yours long before the Canadians.
25098,"This may sound impressive but its not the quantity you have on order that counts, it's the availability."
25099,Most Canadians won't see this in their arm before July 2021.

25124,I would take any vaccine available.
25125,"Had COVID 6 months ago, almost died, but developed no detectable antibodies in a test a while later."
25126,Wow this is crazy.
25127,I am not anti vaccine but covid vaccine just came out and it's not even publicly proven yet.
25128,Forcing someone to do something that can risk their life is not cool.
25129,Remindme 28 weeks
25130,My wife is worried about foot whelps and fever.
25131,Is there anywhere to see the side effects?
25132,"He was sick for about a month in April, he tested positive on the covid antibody test shortly afterwards."
25133,Then six months later he did get sick again and took the regular test for active infection and was positive again.
25134,"I assume he is somewhat of an edge case, because there are only a handful of reports that are coming out of people getting reinfected, but it still seems to be a thing nonetheless."
25135,I'm guessing it's one of those things where your mileage will vary.
25136,"Maybe some people are immune for 6 months, some for a couple years, maybe depends on the person's immune system"
25137,Why would the WH care after they had the spreader in chief event.
25138,Thats what i assume
25139,This is just patently false.
25140,Did you forget the swine flu vaccine that was rushed out?
25141,"People are still battling in court for compensation that they probably won't ever get, given that the companies had blanket immunity from harmful effects."
25142,That's not even close to true lol.
25143,I'm sure it varies wildly from place to place but where I live in AZ it's like 90%+ mask wearing indoors and 60% mask wearing outdoors.
25144,we've come a long way
25145,What can I say we can’t all be mushroom collectors.
25146,But it doesn't work as an analogy.
25147,"The vaccine degrades with temperature, and the human body is warm."
25148,Thus it raises this potential concern of how quickly temp degrades it.
25149,"If your concern is that you don't want your eggs to hard boil, leaving them out of the fridge will never possibly lead to that scenario so it's not at all apt."
25150,"A fitting analogy would be ""If I leave eggs out of the fridge they can warm up and become infected with Salmonella, so wouldn't eating eggs give me Salmonella since my body warms them?"""
25151,"For me it's been the opposite, I've spent this year with a lot of headaches, colds, fatigue, lightheadedness, and muscle tensions."
25152,Pretty amazing that we came up with a vaccine in about under a year.

25154,I want to go to the store without having major anxiety when people pass me by.
25155,Maybe one year at best.

25158,Not so.
25159,&gt; You are wrong.

25163,"&gt; 
&gt; He (Centauri33) was arguing that only ONE country (in italics) have the vaccine."
25164,I named more than one country.
25165,"No, YOU ARE WRONG."
25166,"In your OP, you included England as a separate country in your list, when it is part of both Great Britain and the UK."
25167,"Also in your OP, you claim Great Britain as it's own country as well, when in fact it is an Island."
25168,"Great Britain: The Island that consists of the countries; England, Scotland, and Wales."
25169,"United Kingdom: Is the Island that consists of; England, Scotland, and Wales in addition to Northern Ireland and a number of smaller islands."

25172,This is a really fucked up headline.
25173,I was also reading this won’t necessarily make you not spread the virus.
25174,Meaning those who have taken the vaccine *may* be a symptomatic spreaders.
25175,So yeah masks are going to be around for awhile.

25198,"There is legit no risk, what would you rather have, masks and social distancing forever?"

25244,"Will there be some cutoff percentage that has to be made state by state or county by county where the public can assume their community is pretty much safe, including the person that is vaccinated waiting on that news?"

25269,A business will deliver product to the place where they can sell it and if the US is pissing around about approving it they will just sell it to countries that want it now.

25326,"Now it's every single day, one or two beers or rum and cokes, going through a bottle of rum way faster than I should be."
25327,Miraculously I've maintained my weight (bare minimum) but fuck.
25328,I need some normal life back.
25329,Companies will not be tolerant the only reason they care now is because the government forces them to

25331,We're getting vaccines next week.
25332,And businesses in those towns were violating guidelines anyway with no repercussion.

25334,"2,000 per day are dying while they’re trying to avoid the appearance of haste."
25335,"This is the motivation, I can't fend for my countries guidelines."
25336,I still believe in mandate on public transport and stores.
25337,This is true from what the limited long Covid studies show.
25338,Middle age women are more likely to have long term complications and men are more likely to die than women.
25339,"As it turns out, the US falls into this category."
25340,Insufficient vaccines ordered.
25341,Or very quietly whispered under the breath.
25342,382 million
25343,I like the visual presentation.
25344,Very intuitive.
25345,How many super spreader events have happened at the WH so far?
25346,3?

25349,Ever go skiing with a British guy and someone cuts in the lift line?
25350,OMG I was wondering if I needed to start figuring out if bail was a thing in Canada.
25351,"It’s a moot point, the biggest challenge right now is the limited supply."
25352,"If people want to wait to get it, it doesn’t matter because it isn’t available to the general population until spring."
25353,"Yep, Bell’s Palsy can be caused by viruses so that makes sense."
25354,Such a strange illness.
25355,Herpes should be renamed the Trump pox.
25356,31
25357,Obviously since everything is brand new Pfizer isn't going to stick their neck on the line and say something definitive like this.
25358,"I'm waiting for a few doctors and scientists to at least be willing to say ""probably"" or ""except in rare cases""."
25359,"It makes common sense that if you aren't infected you can't transmit it, right?"
25360,Agreed.
25361,I hope all the medical professionals on reddit know they are fighting the good fight against social media misinformation.
25362,we will fight it by copying what we learn from you guys!!
25363,They are fighting the good fight.
25364,Didn't Health Canada already confirm ours are coming from the factory in Belgium?
25365,I don't think the soon-to-be-former President is aware that his favorite vaccine was largely developed in Europe with a German partner.
25366,"This could be true if vaccinated are not contagious, but so far this it not sure, Oxford trials showed that people carry the virus and can probably spread it."
25367,Some good news came true for once woot
25368,I need work.

25375,"Y'all do love an orderly queue, it's true."
25376,"For this one, no, there's no actual COVID virus, live or dead, in the Pfizer or Moderna vaccines."
25377,Both the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines work by the same spike protein that triggers immune responses to COVID being instead put onto a harmless vector virus that gets injected into your bloodstream.
25378,"Basically, what the Pfizer and Moderna COVID vaccines do is they put a COVID costume on a harmless non-COVID virus in order to directly teach the body how to react to COVID if it ever shows up."
25379,This directly triggering the body's immune response to COVID instead of just putting in weak/dead COVID virus and hoping the body learns how to react to full-strength/live COVID virus by practicing with the weak/dead COVID virus is also why the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines have a higher incidence of causing strong side effects-these side effects are literally your body very quickly nailing its COVID immune response in response to directly being taught how to do it.
25380,"With Great Britain starting to distribute vaccines today and the US  expected to ok the Pfizer vaccine on the 10th, what are other nations timelines looking like?"

25391,This is more compelling than the actual research result.
25392,"a week or two is 10,800 to 20,160 human lives which is too little for Trump to be concerned about."
25393,Oh no doubt.
25394,"They 100% should be the 1st in line because even with all the protection they wear, they're the most at risk for getting it, just because they literally are around it all the time."
25395,I'm very offended Mister Reddit Man!
25396,I wish we knew more about the long term health effects of Covid or that more research is getting done with it.
25397,I'm terrified of what the long term implications are.
25398,It’s just newspaper headlines.
25399,All those vaccine clinical trial subjects got it before her.
25400,Trump said we're a third world country so we qualify right?
25401,[removed]
25402,same.
25403,"I live with my mom, who isn't anti vax, but she is a huge science denier and believes the vaccine is going to cause long term side effects."
25404,"she found something that said 2 people who took the vaccine died from it, which I have not heard about and do not know the legitimacy of... considering she believes the election was rigged... she said this morning that she's not taking the vaccine and that in a year a bunch of babies will be born with birth defects."
25405,I know I shouldn't believe her but the doubt I read online (which isn't a lot) mixed with my own mom is making me extremely anxious over something I probably would not have been worried about otherwise.
25406,IF people choose to get it.

25411,"Here is another great example of how people drawing their own lines doesn't work, and something you would probably consider ""barbed with judgement"": Thanksgiving and Christmas."
25412,Everyone has some justification on why they can get together with family for the holidays.
25413,"""Granny isn't going to be around for much longer, we don't know if we are going to have another holiday together""."
25414,"""We all wear masks and don't feel sick, there is nothing wrong with getting together""."
25415,"""We have been good all year, not seeing anyone, we deserve to see our families for the holidays""."
25416,"Again, I think we can all make justifications for our own personal situations, and a lot of them are compelling."
25417,"And it doesn't matter how heart wrenching the justification is, the virus doesn't care and public health advice isn't based on individual situations."
25418,"Like I said, public health officials just tell us facts, they don't say it should be easy or comfortable to follow them."
25419,"People can make whatever emotional justification they want for their own activity, it doesn't make it safe, it just allows people to feel better about it."
25420,"I'm homeless and if I have to go into shelters or live on campsites, I want the vaccine so I can be protected."
25421,"Because of how lax guidelines on masks have been in probably most areas, I expect the public to rip them off as soon as they have the vaccine, and then it’ll be hard getting people to put them back on unless it’s found out that you can infect people who aren’t vaccinated."
25422,"I feel even then, people still won’t care and just say, “Welp, they should have gotten the vaccine!”

This was my thinking for awhile and what I would be doing, but I assumed that I myself would be getting the vaccine months and months from now as healthcare workers, the elderly, and essential workers need it more than me, plus I probably won’t be quick enough to snatch one up as if these vaccines were immediately taken by scalper bots."
25423,"I'm more concerned about people refusing to take the first, nevermind forgetting the second."
25424,"I feel like (or hope) if you agree to take the first jab, you're gonna do it right and take the second."
25425,I'll be darned...for 20+ years i've believed a HS teacher who said otherwise...he was quite adamant about it too.
25426,Thanks for the correction.
25427,The paperwork is rushed.
25428,Nothing else is.

25436,Healthcare workers that deal with covid patients for hours and hours aren't all getting sick.
25437,"Some of them yes, but they're wearing n95s, face shields and the vast majority of those workers, that are in contact with 100s, 1000s of patients with covid for months haven't gotten covid."
25438,That is what I mean.
25439,"The general population is contracting covid from just being in a elevator, or a restaurant, or their friends."
25440,"They're getting infected more, and easier than healthcare workers."
25441,LOL.
25442,What they are going to find is the vaccine cuts down the transmission by 95% in 90% of individuals or something.
25443,And Reddit will act like we still need to have full measures in place for the rest of the year.
25444,"It ain't happening, you are lucky if people are wearing masks now."
25445,After May you aren't going to see a person in a mask again except one or two weirdos.
25446,"The fact that the vaccine was created so quickly is a miracle, but the production (if it really takes until July for enough vaccines for the general population) is not."
25447,[deleted]
25448,The only problem with this statistic is that we're not first in line for any of them.
25449,"It's unlikely that everyone who wants a vaccine is fully protected before next fall, unless production yields start to increase fairly quickly."
25450,But it's still good that Canada has thought of securing doses for countries that don't otherwise have the means to pay for them.
25451,How is this new?
25452,I'd take what I can get.
25453,The Oxford/AZ one is my last choice though.
25454,"It is better than nothing, and seems safe, but it isn't helpful."
25455,The Moderna and Pfizer/BoiNTech ones are so close to the same that I don't think anyone can form a real opinion on which is better.

25458,One thing people don't generally consider about divorce rates- the majority of them are few people divorcing multiple times.
25459,"What questions are being raised, are people really that stupid these days?"
25460,I assume lots of healthcare workers have already been exposed due to how shitty our PPE is too.
25461,"But we've also been in the pandemic so long, we know reinfections *can* happen so even if they had it early on, it's probably still wise to make them vaccinated first."
25462,When is Sherlock Holmes’s turn?
25463,Yeah fuck jay the snake.
25464,He has been shielding our real numbers in order to keep his few money makers open  and not help anyone he just watches things happen and rolls over and waits for someone else to tell him what to do or give him money.
25465,Our numbers are ridiculously high and he’s just letting shit happen.
25466,This didn’t happen overnight.
25467,He needs to listen to his own “science and data”
25468,Anything we buy this year should be able to be stored for next year.
25469,"I don't think anyone really expects these vaccines to be one and done, lifelong protection."
25470,"Considering that much of those options probably won't materialize until summer or later, it was a poor decision."
25471,Let’s hope!
25472,"From the latest Oxford study, it looks a bit like this is something to discuss for the 2021 or 2022 generation of vaccines."

25474,"Yeah, reporting error yesterday this is correcting for."
25475,We're still really high though.
25476,"Neither Novavax nor Johnson and Johnson have completed their stage 3 trials, which then the data has to be analyzed and reviewed for approval by the FDA."
25477,J&amp;J uses similar adenovirus vector to AstraZeneca and also had to pause their trial due to an unforseen (and unstated to the public) illness in a patient.
25478,"They are currently hoping to end their trials by February, so approval could take another month after that."
25479,"On the upside, they only require one dose to get coverage, so they will be useful hopefully by March or April in reducing symptoms in Covid-exposed individuals (like AZ, they focused on symptom reduction, so potential asymptomatic spread after exposure is a possibility)."
25480,"For Novavax, they have been halted a few times due to FDA regulations."
25481,Their tech for their vaccine is different and new and gaining emergency use certification will be trickier.
25482,"They've started phase 3 in a few countries, but are just getting started in the US with their phase 3 trials."
25483,"Both of these will help around spring, if their are no hiccups, but that is 3-4 months from now, when Pfizer and Moderna are ready within the next week, if approved."
25484,"Right now, our cases are exploding and the closed cases (death vs 'recovery' (which in some states auto logs if they aren't dead or in the hospital after 14-28 days and doesn't take into account long haulers who could die from the damage due to Covid down the road) are at 3% deaths."
25485,"We've had over 1 million cases so far in December - 30,000 people are going to die just from one week of positive cases."
25486,This will keep going up until mitigation efforts are put in place or high amounts of the vaccine are introduced to the masses.
25487,"Since most of the state and federal government are holding out hope for those vaccines, they are doing little to mitigate spread (which can still theoretically happen with, at least, the AZ and J&amp;J vaccine)."
25488,"Since we only secured enough of the two most likely to grant approval in the next week or two to cover 100 million people, cases are still going to rise until the other 3-4 vaccines gain approval from the FDA, which is neither a guarantee at this point, nor a real answer for the immediate issue of exploding cases at exponential rates, with one holiday just about to show the impact on rates and two more gathering holidays before even those that get Pfizer or Moderna vaccines have full coverage."

25495,I'm in the UK and we just started vaccinations today.
25496,Major facebook posts covering it are just a cesspool of misinformation and lies.
25497,Didn't expect as much anti-vax stuff as there is.
25498,It's a shame.
25499,I opened this thread just assuming it would be the same.
25500,Nice to see it isn't.
25501,He says to open schools and this sub keeps ignoring his advice and going on about how classrooms are a massive threat to public health.
25502,Hence the sarcastic comment showing that Fauci himself is endorsing schools returning to session so all these comments suggesting schools are one of the biggest vectors are flat out wrong.
25503,what papers?
25504,let's just say you don't fit the profile of a scientific paper reader.
25505,"back in the real world, [Nature Index has Chinese Academy of Sciences as the #1 contributing institution."
25506,"](https://www.natureindex.com/institution-outputs/generate/All/global/All/score) Nature Index measures the contribution of institutions to Nature, one of the most prestigious publishers in the physical and biological sciences."

25508,They’ll be first come first serve(within the priority group) and used up as fast as possible.
25509,There’s not going to be stock left if they can help it.
25510,"That said, here’s my take 

Pfizer/Moderna kind of the same, you’ve got to take twice and side effects is medium


J&amp;J Janssen data is not out yet but they are doing a single injection study(as well as double) might be the easiest and most used

AstraZeneca/Oxford they kind of messed up their clinical trial."
25511,One part of study showed efficacy in the 60s.
25512,Wouldn’t be my first choice.
25513,Getting tired of headlines like this.
25514,"Any subreddits, facebook groups, etc dedicated to debunking memes, misinformation?"
25515,"no, but a lab-produced section of nucleic acids is introduced into your cells that code for something resembling the viral spike protein that those cells then display for your immune system to get angry about"
25516,I’m driving 16 hours to see my family for the holidays as I want to avoid flying but will need to stop at some point for rest.
25517,Call me crazy but I’m going to just sleep in my car at a hotel parking lot that I pay for the rate.
25518,Anything I should be aware of when doing this?
25519,I have very tinted windows so it’ll be hard to see me.
25520,Yeah if there’s one thing I can’t stand it is a sitting president taking credit for a previous president’s accomplishments.

25523,I got paid 11 an hour in a hospital to do CNA work.

25525,I will not keep my conspiracies to myself but you can keep your bullshit opinions to yourself ok. See that works both ways idiot.
25526,I doubt it.
25527,"Black people are more likely to work in retail, food service, working class jobs that aren't done behind a computer screen."
25528,"Employers haven't provided PPE and especially not for months, thus they are more continually exposed to the virus."
25529,They are more likely to take public transit.

25578,"At least what you linked called it what it is, including BioNtech’s name, you know, since they actually did the science for the thing."
25579,"Not that Pfizer’s logistical support isn’t nice, but it should hardly give them first billing, let alone sole, as is often the case when the vaccine is mentioned."

25589,"this is light speed for an approval, too."
25590,the turnaround is probably unprecedented
25591,I can't believe that no one at Coventry University Hospital didn't realise he should get it first.
25592,Honestly negligent
25593,if it prevents sickness the spread won't matter...
25594,Exactly what I was thinking.
25595,"Will the CDC reverse their stance of ""don't travel"" too?"
25596,Most states require some sort of medical certificate and training.
25597,You are probably not eligible.
25598,This vaccine will be our last stimulus check.
25599,"Sure, I support freedom."
25600,"But I also think that if you don't exercise it in the right way, that you face consequences."
25601,"Which I think you do too, it's just that we differ on what the right way is."
25602,62% is much lower than 95% in my experience.
25603,"I have trouble believing it was an ""honest mistake"" and not corrupt officers trying to cash out."
25604,I thought the link was for the MMR vaccine.

25618,It was said in the beginning when people balked at masking that it would take personal infections or tragic deaths in and around them before they changed their minds.

25648,SPOILER: It won't!
25649,When you wake up it will be January 1st 2021
25650,It’s still in end of the phase 3 trials even in official medical documents.
25651,I think the mass rollout is just about to start.
25652,"Another issue is that Russian manufacturing capacity is lacking, it would be hard to get hundreds of millions of doses quickly."
25653,"If public health experts say there is significant risk of people dying if we don't hold on to masks for a few more months then yes, I will continue caring about not killing other people and showing it by wearing a piece of fabric over my face when in public."
25654,"Especially for places people can't opt out of going, like at work and the grocery store."
25655,It's really not that hard.
25656,Would it still be if you toss few billion dollars at it?
25657,That’s what I’m saying: the government DID make an arbitrary date.
25658,Those were the original goalposts.
25659,"Now mass vaccination is the goalpost, but it seems like some people want to live like this forever."
25660,Looks more like June.
25661,"On Tuesday, the Trump administration’s vaccine chief, Dr. Moncef Slaoui, said he believes every American could be inoculated against Covid-19 by June."
25662,The country has almost 331 million peopl
25663,"We currently expect that it does all of those things, we just don't have the data on spread yet because symptoms was the main thing the researchers were looking for."
25664,"In any case, we have pretty strong evidence ([paper](https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19/comments/iccj85/contact_settings_and_risk_for_transmission_in/) and [paper](https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19/comments/jkaluq/risk_factors_associated_with_covid19_infection_a/)) that people with mild symptoms are far less infectious than people who go on to have severe symptoms, so even in the worst-case-scenario where the vaccine only stop symptoms and not infections, it should still effectively contain spread."
25665,More likely they are just overwhelmingly busy right now.
25666,It's quite the endeavor to manufacture hundreds of millions of doses of a brand new vaccine you just developed.
25667,I think you're right - I would guess that this number will be higher than some expect.
25668,"For example, many states in the US want to prioritize homeless people, which makes sense, but it's going to be difficult to get many in that population back for the second shot."
25669,"Also, once the vaccinations are going fast enough to drop the numbers of hospitalizations and deaths, there will be people who simply don't bother, thinking that the pandemic is over."
25670,"Ahh, so you know Mr. Brannigan."
25671,Sweet.
25672,"In any case, that guy was learning and he didn't just pop up and what smells like blue."
25673,Anyone who says there is no cure or vaccine for the common cold is just lying at this point.
25674,"This has proven that when there's a will, there's a way."
25675,"My guess is that ""Big NyQuil"" has a vested interested in making sure we suffer from the common cold until the end of time and they're looking forward to the day COVID-19 becomes endemic and their products are used to treat it also."
25676,I'm frustrated by a friend of mine who went on a long rant about how you can't trust governments and corporations when I brought up the COVID vaccine.
25677,She went on to list all these times science has been wrong in the past(or paid off by corporations) along with the times the government experimented on people like MK Ultra.
25678,"She doesn't watch any conspiracy videos, but says she watch a lot of documentaries instead."
25679,"Moreover, she's supposedly liberal and isn't an anti-vaxxer, but at times I wonder I about her."
25680,Are people like her impossible to reach out to?
25681,"Yeah, they need to be as up front as humanly possible because the first few crazies who do get the vaccine and then feel any side effects are going to go social media viral saying they got covid from the vaccine, etc."
25682,Have to do everything they can to head that off.
25683,"This seems correct in theory, but think of the reality of the rollout -- we know we are living with tens of millions of selfish, lying anti-maskers in the US (the ones that buy those fake laminated ADA cards)."
25684,"Within a few weeks from now they will already be trashing their masks and start claiming that THEY are vaccinated, while they push the Walmart greeter out of the way and barge into stores unmasked, or scream at people on the bus or subway that question them."
25685,This will all be during a critical several months that many people have NOT gotten vaccinated yet.
25686,"So for the first several months as these are rolled out, you can let down your guard somewhat if already vaccinated, but don't be surprised to be still wearing a mask while in public such as shopping or taking the bus."
25687,No.
25688,Counterfeit ones will just make managing this outbreak worse.
25689,Many people will get a fake one so they can party.
25690,Serious question - what are next steps for an average American?
25691,"I know there’s an order of who gets the vaccines first and that’s absolutely okay, I just want to make sure I’m first on the signup sheet for my group."

25697,"Yeah, I'll quarantine if I get COVID, but I'm not going to go give all of my information to contact tracers."
25698,Even moreso if I did something illegal.
25699,"If you make it illegal to go to friends' houses, then it makes contact tracing ineffective because anyone who did go to a friend's house is not going to tell you that."
25700,Better to keep it legal so that you can trace it accurately.
25701,"It’ll be June, assuming everything works well."
25702,Any large scale effort like this never gets done on time.

25714,"I worry about my elderly, transplant recipient relative."
25715,I keep telling him he needs to talk to his doctors about it.
25716,I'm not even sure his doctors will know the answer.
25717,This is starting to resemble a temper tantrum.
25718,They 100% did not tell us just two weeks in March lol.
25719,There were articles in February saying we should expect to be in cycling lockdowns for a year.
25720,People just don’t read
25721,"It would make sense that restrictions would get lifted when data shows that things are improving, like cases consistently trending downward."
25722,"If that happens soon after the vaccine is available, then it'll probably be good to lift them; if it takes longer to deploy the vaccine widely and for the time between the shot and immunity to pass, then that's how it goes."
25723,It doesn't make sense for you or I to go demanding that we have normal by some arbitrary date no matter what.
25724,I 100% agree with you.
25725,I just want people to understand that not everyone is some asshole who doesn't understand the risk involved.
25726,I do.
25727,"I 100% understand and if the government would literally help at all, I would gladly lock myself in my house and chill."
25728,But there are a LOT of people out there like me.
25729,Who have already lost so much because of this virus.
25730,Either help us and lock down or don't help us and watch as people ignore everything you say.
25731,I'm 30 and last year I would've bet anything I would never be in this situation.
25732,But I am.
25733,And I've been abandoned by the very country I used to love.

25735,When Biden takes over and enforces new regulations I will listen to them.
25736,Because I genuinely feel like he will try to help me.
25737,He already is!!!!
25738,"But right now, I just won't."
25739,I can't afford to listen to them anymore.
25740,I literally can't afford it.
25741,"He didn’t say the vaccine is dangerous, it’s just that drawing conclusions from combining the data in that manner is dangerous."
25742,"If you can take the time off to quarantine and your parents are able and willing to do the same then you could still go, It's a pretty big burden for most folks to take more than two weeks off at the end of the year though."
25743,"I'm fortunate in that I'm able to work from home which means I can keep working while quarantined, but not everyone has that option."
25744,Merde!
25745,Or maybe covid is really easy to vaccinate for.
25746,Check out the stickied thread right underneath this one.
25747,I read it.
25748,This is a study about nonpharmalogical interventions and mortality.
25749,What is the argument you are trying to make?
25750,"But, why did the virus not come back after the interventions ended, the opposite of what they saw in winter 1919 and we’re seeing this winter?"
25751,Probably because a) the virus became less deadly and b) people got it and became immune.
25752,That’s how pandemics usually used to end (if they did) in the past.
25753,I’m not sure what the current infection rate of covid has to do with our discussing.
25754,I’m not arguing that we should let everyone get covid nor that we should stop current interventions.
25755,lock your doors.
25756,"but i'd suggest a lot of places before i suggested a hotel parking lot...like a hospital parking lot for instance, safer and security has bigger fish to fry right now."
25757,"My cousin in Las Vegas had double lung pneumonia  a few months ago and had to be hospitalized  ( with my grandma suspecting he is having on-again off-again hospital visits)   


He swore it wasn't covid and the doctors blamed him living with his grandmother ( on his other side of the family)  who smoked like a chimney as a kid  that triggered something nearly 2 decades later."
25758,"I'm not saying it's impossible, just the timing couldn't be more convenient to have something like that trigger for someone who hasn't been I the hospital much in his entire life."
25759,"Justified now, but not when the hospitals become devoid of covid patients and deaths from covid."
25760,"Sure, there may be a death/serious illness here and there, but that does *NOT* justify putting society under mandatory masks and lockdown forever."
25761,"We did not sign a, “contract” for the “new normal”."
25762,Perhaps.
25763,"The bigger issue IMO is that a load of people with experience have been laid off, so it will be easier to hire one of them than it is to hire and train a new graduate."

25767,We had one where we all made the same cocktail.
25768,What other ideas?
25769,Games?
25770,What do we know about covid reinfection rates?
25771,"And if people are getting reinfected with some frequency, how might this or other vaccines work beyond a few months or so?"
25772,"I mean I’m getting it regardless, but still wondering."
25773,"From what I've heard, the vaccine should give us better immunity than if we were already sick."
25774,That's why people who have had the virus should still get the vaccine.
25775,I'm hoping that that particular administration is completely irrelevant by the time there's a massive roll out.
25776,"From my understanding, all of those are much much more difficult to make a vaccine for than SARS-CoV-19"
25777,Do you feel guilty for all those you’ve killed in prior years by not wearing a mask in the grocery store?

25917,I came here for this
25918,"Ok so if a company has all that right rules in place but one of the employees doesn’t share his Facebook with management and goes to a party, gets Covid, and shows up at work Monday and patients get it, do you think the company is still liable?"
25919,"Tioga, Pennsylvania."
25920,125% of beds and 100% of ICU.
25921,Yikes.
25922,"People don't seem to realise that a runaway pandemic will cost the economy dearly, both immediately and in the long term."
25923,Adding another virus to the economy is like adding another hire purchase agreement to your household for something expensive that you don't need or want.
25924,You can't afford to keep doing that indefinately.
25925,The list of possible harms people cite regarding lockdowns contains nothing that would not also happen in greater measure by letting the virus run away.
25926,"Even then, they are conflating incompetent lockdowns with the entire set of all possible mitigations (incompetent measures backfired so we should not even try to do better using measures used successfully elsewhere, mentality)."
25927,It is telling that many anti-lockdown pundits typically want no mitigations at all rather than more effective and less harmful mitigations.
25928,"In AU and NZ they spend money to reduce damage to the economy, and although they are still stuck with the worldwide pandemic recession that everyone else faces, they are able to bounce back up again because business, industry and exports have been preserved."
25929,So why are states closing hair salons?
25930,Masks work great!

25966,"I'm sorry, but lots of even ""small"" landlords also discriminate against people and prevent affordable housing efforts and it's important to include that in a discussion."
25967,"There are some differences, but I've had way more nasty abusive experiences with small landlords."
25968,"Big landlord companies are bad at maintenance for sure and have a huge problem with absenteeism, but small landlords have propositioned me for sex, flouted rules just like big companies, acted like my living space I was paying for was theirs so would show up unannounced ALL the goddamn time, and also sucked at maintenance."
25969,"Maybe you're one of the only shining stars that is a good landlord, but please understand how you are in a position of privilege to not only have your OWN housing, but able to rent housing as well."
25970,That is a privilege that I and many others will never ever be able to likely have  unless we are lucky.
25971,So maybe take this on the chin and accept there is a BIG problem with housing and many issues within housing that are overwhelmingly affecting renters who don't have alternatives.

26158,"&gt; The big picture: When AstraZeneca's vaccine was administered in two standard doses, it was about 62% effective in preventing symptomatic infections."
26159,"&gt;    That's not as high as the roughly 95% efficacy reported by the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines, but AstraZeneca's has some other advantages over those two, including easier distribution."
26160,No one who had received both doses of the vaccine in AstraZeneca's trials developed a severe infection or had to be hospitalized.
26161,I would be willing to bet that there will be more than 50 million people vaccinated in the USA before June 21st (the first day of summer).
26162,Projections have that many people being vaccinated by end of March with just Pfizer and Moderna vaccines.

26179,I remember reading that once the concept was fleshed out a lot of early vaccines only took months as well - they were for easy enough viruses.

26215,"In people who are infected with the actual virus, the body will naturally produce antibodies against spike protein (among other structures)."
26216,"If antibodies against the spike protein caused infertility, we would have seen the increase in infertility by now given how many people have been infected."
26217,"The safety issues with other mRNA drugs have generally not been due to the mRNA itself, not the protein it translates to, but rather the method of delivery into cells."
26218,Most often cationic lipids are used to incorporate the mRNA into lipid nanoparticles.
26219,This is also what Pfizer is using.
26220,Repeated exposure to cationic lipids can cause problems with inflammation and liver damage.
26221,This has been a big problem for some mRNA drug candidates that would need to be given repeatedly.
26222,"For vaccines however, the technology is very interesting because a vaccine only has to be given once or twice, so you will likely not run into the same safety issues."
26223,"If we end up needing to give a new CoV shot every year however, we might not be able to keep using this."
26224,I think the word we use to classify the groups is confusing.
26225,"""Immediate family"" seems to mean different things depending on who you ask."
26226,More likely the zoo food processed by infected staff passed on to the lions.
26227,Not sure about this Zoo but many Zoos weigh the meat and cut them up into specific portions before feeding.
26228,So it could be that.
26229,Yeah schools should be find.
26230,"And honestly, as an adult working a corporate job from home, it really wouldn't destroy me to just keep doing that until October."
26231,"It isn't ideal, bit I'll live."
26232,They're making me proud and they should be making u proud for dedicating careers to develop a vaccine for us
26233,"2% jump for news that was expected to happen, means the price bump has been building leading up to this point."
26234,"mRNA is not a “novel process” in any way, shape, or form."
26235,"mRNA has been investigated for its potential as a vaccine agent for years, this is just the first time an mRNA based vaccine is being rolled out."
26236,"Overall, mRNA is truly one of the most thoroughly researched and best understood molecules in all of biology."
26237,"Nah, there's tons of chronic alcoholics that have already had liver failure/damage that make it to 65 or more"

26240,"The restrictions should be based on the health and safety of the population, not your convenience."
26241,"As long as health risks exist, the restrictions protecting citizens should be left in place."
26242,"Now, that doesn't mean they can't do other things to try to force or incentivize others to get the vaccination but you can't remove the restrictions as long as the health risk exists."
26243,"First thought that popped up:
[How Vodka ruined Russia](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vK7l55ZOVIc)"
26244,It should be said that this means almost certain approval for Pfizer in the coming days.
26245,Also vaccines take a long time to get enough data.
26246,Think about how rare something is.
26247,"With coronavirus being so prevalent, it was pretty easy to reach the number of infections needed to get significant data."

26249,I remember seeing news articles last spring (during peak stay-at-home times) about couples getting married in a church parking lot while all the guests stayed in their own cars and cheered them on.

26251,"As Fauci has said, the British did a very thorough  review process, but the FDA does things their own way and essentially went even deeper into the data than Britain did."

26253,"Both can and it seems like DID work fine, just different timelines."
26254,You hear that folks?
26255,Remember to stay at least 6ft away when you encounter a lion.
26256,It’s for your safety.
26257,Once you have the vaccine you can go back to your normal contact with lions.
26258,We have the same thing here.
26259,It’s really a question of whether you include administrative and research staff.
26260,"I work in a hospital, but I don’t work with patients."
26261,I get samples from a clinical research nurse who is literally in the OR and meeting with the kids’ families.
26262,And I work with the surgeon for his research projects.
26263,"Both those people will get the vaccine right away, but I won’t because I try to not walk around where patients or there families are."
26264,The custodial staff in the hospital area absolutely should get the vaccine earlier than me.
26265,Likewise the people in each department checking in the patients.
26266,Likewise the guy who pushes sick kids around in beds and wheelchairs and the lady at the help desk who sees hundreds of people a day.
26267,"But the hospital brass who sit in offices, shouldn’t."
26268,"In our hospital, we expect the ER and respiratory staff will get it first along with the folks in immunology because the kids with immunological issues will be at potentially higher risk."
26269,"Then, of course the folks in the various ICUs."
26270,Who counts in the 40 million?
26271,How about the 20 million?
26272,That’s where the numbers get hard to calculate.
26273,I imagine the states will start partitioning priorities.
26274,Then the hospital will have a big say in the order of vaccination.
26275,I’ll keep this sub updated.
26276,Because side effects would have already showed up since the trials began months ago.

26283,And so have most people I know as well.
26284,Why is that funny?
26285,Way to bypass everything in the OP explaining why it's faster this time
26286,They also reviewed safety and found it in compliance with standards for the EUA.
26287,Any serious side effects would most likely have surfaced by the 6 month mark.
26288,???
26289,Oxford seemed ahead back in July and had similar immunogenicity numbers.

26297,I'm saying mask up until medical experts say no to.
26298,Which I'm assuming would be after the second vaccine shot.
26299,"I'm not saying forever, but I also won't make a big deal about having to wear a mask for a month or so after my vaccine just to keep others safe."
26300,"Ugh, down voted for the pay wall."
26301,And now I want Carl Jr.'s.

26303,I'm not going to forget the government abandoning me and millions of other working class people while they squabble over how much exactly to shovel at Wall Street for the rest of my life.
26304,Hard to say.
26305,Wars and disasters and terrorist attacks get remembered because there is at least a story behind the events that you can wrap your head around.
26306,"For wars and terrorism, there is a villain;  Someone does a Bad Thing."
26307,People die.
26308,Some people show courage in some way.
26309,"With a disaster, a Bad Thing Happens, people help each other."
26310,Either of those spawn stories that are easy to make a post in r/nextfuckinglevel/ about.
26311,"Also for most people those things happen to other people, so the people who did not experience it are curious about it."
26312,"For a Pandemic, it comes out of nowhere."
26313,No one person does a Bad Thing.
26314,"At worst, someone misses the opportunity to do the Right Thing or fails to be prepared."
26315,There is no glory or dignity in getting a fever and laying sick in bed until you either die or get better.
26316,And most of the pandemic is living in some combination of fear of getting sick and anger at not being able to live your life.
26317,And this is essentially happening for everyone.
26318,"Either you got Covid, you know someone who did, or your life has been fucked with by the lockdowns and economic fallout."
26319,"On the other hand, this pandemic and the political bullshit that it spawned will be much better documented and recorded than any other pandemic in history."

26332,"No point in beating yourself up, turn it into a learning experience"
26333,We want to do nothing and then park ourselves in the back.
26334,There are still large swaths of Americans that believe that our response is on par or better than most other countries.
26335,If you had a friend that objectively sucked at something and it was obvious to everyone else in the room and he bragged at how he was at least as good as everyone else you would see that as a delusional character flaw.

26354,"This whole thing about ""protecting others"" never worked in the first place."
26355,Should have hired another PR firm and chosen a different strategy if they wanted the public to wear masks after getting vaccinated.
26356,"To be fair, theres probably way more people than you'd think who don't understand that a vaccine being approved doesn't mean this is over."
26357,These kinds of statements seem stupid because they're so obvious.
26358,But people are stupid
26359,"Given the truly desperate conditions many people (and some in this sub) are in, I want to make it clear that this is intended solely for those who are not struggling and just choosing to gather for the holidays:

26364,Hopefully the app isn't required.
26365,"I'm 100% certain that the app will be used to collect data on you which will be ""shared"" and sold to others."
26366,People shouldn't have to hand over their personal data to CVS and whoever they decide to sell it to just to get a vaccine.
26367,Haha what in the world

26377,That's like 3 households for us.
26378,That's fucking ridiculous and way too much of risk
26379,Every black celebrity needs to get the vaccine publicly
26380,Because social media gives stupid people word wide attention.
26381,Other stupid people see it and spread it.
26382,Just like a virus.

26391,And I'm not trying to cause any doubt on the vaccine.
26392,A question that keeps coming up with my family is about potential for long-hauler type symptoms from the vaccine.
26393,"In short, some theories about what is causing the 'long hauler"" symptoms is not the COVID-19 infection itself, but rather the immune system response 3-6 months after the infection has been beaten."
26394,"If the vaccine is intended to generate an immune response without the initial infection, is there a chance the immune system training from the vaccine could cause the same long-hauler symptoms 3-6 months after getting the vaccine?"

26782,"I'm planning on getting the vaccine, and have never had any issue getting other ones."
26783,I have small worries in the back of my mind about if there could be long term effects though since many vaccines take so long to develop.
26784,"My understanding is that the reason most of them take so long to develop is because of the legal reasons they have to get around, not actual safety trials of the vaccine."

26819,I do my best to understand where other people are coming from.
26820,"If I can understand them perspective, I can have a better discussion with them about it."
26821,What I want to make clear is that I personally don’t have a problem with an mRNA vaccine.
26822,"I think the trials have done what they could to ferret out any immediate safety concerns, and any long-term concerns are far outweighed by the very real current health and socioeconomic harms we face *right now."
26823,"* 

However, that doesn’t change the fact that as much as 40% of the population doesn’t want to take the vaccine."
26824,"And so, if I try to understand their concern, I can maybe help them overcome it."
26825,Or maybe not.
26826,It’s tough to argue with fear one way or another.
26827,Thanks for the kind discussion!

26831,"My favorite part was booking an appointment, filling out all the paperwork for a flu shot,submitting it all, and then 10 minutes later getting a call from the Pharmacy saying that the had no Flu Vaccine in stock and were very sorry but they were unable to stop the computer from accepting appointments."
26832,There is no way I'd trust a CVS appointment booked online or through an app for the covid vaccine.
26833,[deleted]
26834,I did.
26835,They were apologetic by email but that's as far as it went.
26836,Got a $5 off coupon.
26837,I'm so mad.
26838,"At them, at that moron and at myself for not telling him to put his mask on right."
26839,"This year I got a quad valent flu shot, and had a pretty strong (for a flu shot ) reaction too."
26840,Within about 5 minutes I could a twinge running up my neck ( I wonder if they managed to inject right into a lymph network ).

26856,"But while they are rolling out, the people who get them first should still be considerate of those who can't get vaccinated yet."
26857,We've had off site hospitals since April here too
26858,"You can ""go with"" what you like but the data still remains the same and the number remains as solid."
26859,Lol I remember back then it was considered weird to be following it enough to be on the subreddit.
26860,Back in February this was basically a Chinese news sub- been a wild ride
26861,We apparently aren't exercising the options.
26862,And the timing  of refusing to do so will likely cost us the summer.
26863,It's also extremely dependent on all getting approval.
26864,"The other issue is Pfizer is showing to be damn near perfect, but it is unlikely the others will all be."
26865,"So, we refused what may end up being the best product on the market, a decision that will likely slow recovery and cause more people to get sick."
26866,It’s also worth noting that the Oxford trial also regularly tested for asymptomatic patients.
26867,Phase 3 Trials for the other vaccines only tested if their volunteers had symptoms and this could be a factor in the reported lower effectiveness of the Oxford vaccine.
26868,Definitely.
26869,My husband has three sisters.
26870,His parents have decided we will all exchange names and open our gifts over Zoom on Christmas.
26871,"Great, right?"
26872,"Except they have posted themselves visiting all three sisters this past week on different days, no distancing or masks, indoors."
26873,I guess they think it’s okay as long as we’re not all together at the same time?
26874,"One photo was of my mother-in-law, who is obese, diabetic, and in her mid-70s, kissing her son-in-law on the cheek."

26877,"Cheer me up, why dont you?"
26878,Lol.
26879,"Sadly, I do know people who are smart (by many of the ways that we might try to objectively measure ""smart"") but still think that COVID is not that big a deal."
26880,"They do tend to have a particular political philosophy and watch a lot of news shows which tender to that political base, though."
26881,"So they end up with rationalizations which might sound ""reasonable"" to the extent that one doesn't look at them too closely."
26882,Classic.
26883,How do their brains work I wonder?
26884,It’s a really mystery to me.
26885,"If my reading comprehension is correct, they said they would buy 100M doses if it worked."
26886,"Pfizer said ""you should buy 200M if it works"" and the White House said ""nah"""
26887,It's just too much to fathom.
26888,I think you become numb to it because you can't grasp the impact.
26889,"My state has had a low impact, and until this morning covid hadn't touched me personally."
26890,Nah man you can’t be bringing yourself down like that

26909,"Oh boy, this is going to be interesting."
26910,"Thing is, your reasons are kinda non sense."
26911,Covid survives on surfaces for a long time.
26912,Gyms are super spreader areas since people will touch all the same stuff at the same place and wipe their sweat or their face with their hands or similar.
26913,"Obly because gym goes are generelly more healthy does not mean they are less likely to spread the virus, because this is kinda what you imply."
26914,Yeah and as my very first act of common sense I'm going to completely ignore your bullshit.
26915,Fauci is doing the best he can with what he has.
26916,These first gen vaccines can have pretty hard side effects.
26917,"Nothing permanent, but people have said it can feel like a hangover, which your immune system is having a very strong response."
26918,"Normally people don't like a vaccine though that keeps you on the couch for a day, so a lot of work goes into tailoring immune response so you have all benefits without feeling wiped out."
26919,There are adjuvants they can add to tailor the immune response to maximize protection and minimize feeling oogy or wiped out.
26920,So they haven't had as much time to tune it so it feels no worse than a flu shot.
26921,"We've discussed amongst ourselves, and decided we are gonna immunize in stages, so one adult is at least feeling good enough to help with house tasks."
26922,All the dead people didn't already put it into perspective for you?
26923,The way it’s spreading this winter we will reach herd immunity before the vaccine is available
26924,That's my point.
26925,That person is just trying to scare people about shutdowns.
26926,"In the US, and the vast majority of countries, even the first shutdowns didn't last very long."
26927,There's no way in hell that current ones are going to last until April like the person said (or be enforced that long if at all).
26928,"If the date is April/May, hopefully it is."
26929,Having the means (funding and equipment) alongside qualified professionals plus a strong sense of urgency brings us to where we are right now.

26934,Glad the comment was deleted but sad that this is the viewpoint of a lot of reddit users and people in general :/
26935,This will be looked back in the history texts as one of mankind’s greatest scientific achievements.
26936,Can you point to any western vaccines made in last few decades that have any long-term severe side effects that don’t show up within the first couple of months?
26937,"&gt; Get vaccinated Jan. 1st

Eh, you need the hair of the dog on the 1st"
26938,Each system has their own policy and protocol and we still don’t have great data.
26939,"But hypothetically...

We don’t know how many healthcare workers have been infected."
26940,Most are not getting regular tests or even tested for low risk symptoms.
26941,"They have a good amount of contact with COVID positive persons, mostly protected with reused PPE."
26942,Why don’t we provide antibody testing for large groups of hospital/healthcare systems?
26943,"I understand that everybody who wants the vaccine ‘deserves’ one, especially frontline healthcare workers, but given the limited number of doses immediately available... wouldn’t it do the greatest good to give vaccines to those without antibodies first and collect data on infections?"
26944,And then catch everybody up on vaccines as they become more available?
26945,This is just hypothetical and involves a lot more testing and data tracking and difficult decision making.
26946,"But, I’m genuinely curious what could be the risks (to those waiting with no vaccine) of giving the small number of available vaccines to persons with antibodies."
26947,Fucking murderers
26948,"Fantastic news, not just for the US and UK but for the whole world."
26949,The Oxford vaccine is only around £3 per dose (compared with Pfizer’s at £15 and Moderna’s at £25).
26950,"A lot easier to transport too, this will really help developing nations in particular."
26951,Nope.

26958,*
26959,Why are you ignoring the science?
26960,In many cases it's *absolutely* easier to be black in America (i.e.
26961,"if you want to be a doctor, your road is much easier.)"
26962,It's even easier if you don't face the underlying challenges affirmative action was designed to address.
26963,i.e.
26964,if you grow up middle-class and black you still get all the advantages on med school admission without facing substantial additional life challenges.
26965,Sometimes the mask even slips and people admit it.
26966,"For example, a white woman pretended to have black roots to get a cushy academic job."
26967,People eventually found out.
26968,"In articles, they specifically mention all the access and benefits she received for being a POC."
26969,"&gt;In any case, Figueroa said, “what needs to be accounted for is what she gained by taking this identity,” in terms of fellowships, grants and more, “

Pretty obvious admission that things were easier for her because of the 'identity' she chose."
26970,"So facing the same exact challenges in life and no other variable changing, she would get a boost for identifying as POC or no boost for not identifying as POC."
26971,That means her life would be made easier just for having a claim to being a POC.
26972,Insane.
26973,We hope.
26974,Vaccines fail often enough that it shouldn't be a surprise if the other 3 vaccines coming don't work at all.
26975,(in fact statistically all 3 failing would still be better than expected odds overall!)
26976,Okay?
26977,It can be ignorance and apprehension at the same time.
26978,So you think conservatives that distrust the government aren't apprehensive?
26979,That they don't think they have good reason to not trust the government?
26980,Stop the intellectual gymnastics.
26981,"If you're laughing at one group laugh at the other, too."
26982,If you're sympathetic towards one group be sympathetic towards the other.
26983,"I don't care, just be consistent."
26984,So the scenario you outlined isn't happening?
26985,Because big government bad?
26986,This is a flat out lie
26987,Let’s close outdoor stuff too....for...reasons.
26988,"She's also a legend, from Northern Ireland, volunteering to publicly receive be the first person in a mass programme, and sings the high praise of her black nurse."
26989,I'd say we shouldn't hold her cohort's voting habits  against her.
26990,My kids have been tested many times.
26991,So I don't know where you've gotten the idea that no one is testing kids
26992,"Honestly, I wish that was the only crowd that would do it."
26993,"There's also the ""It only kills old/vulnerable people."
26994,"Why should I put my life on hold for them?"""
26995,crowd.
26996,They tend to infuriate me the most.
26997,"Moderna will probably be cleared next week, and J&amp;J, and Oxford should be approved around the end of January."
26998,Most Russians would rather get the coronavirus than give up alcohol for two months!
26999,"As OP said, it's been sitting in storage for two weeks, not sitting at sites where people will receive their doses."
27000,£33 here in America without insurance.
27001,"Right, my company has a large presence in Taiwan and I used go there for work regularly."
27002,"If you even dared to suggest these measures to ‘Muricans here, you’d be shot."
27003,It’s ridiculous.
27004,"waa waa waa UK too fast, ok nevermind its fine"
27005,"What about the ""long term lung scarring""?"
27006,"What if ends up in people feeling ""tired"" six months down the line?"
27007,You’re so close.
27008,These same folks were yelling at the Fed to buy things faster and to use the wartime defense production act to FORCE manufacturers to build ventilators.
27009,This happens after every disaster.
27010,The Monday morning quarterbacks come in to criticize.
27011,So predictable and lame.
27012,Her 2017 arrest suggests she has a history of manipulative online behavior.
27013,Cyber stalking and revenge porn?
27014,We should seriously be questioning her Twitter conduct.
27015,Authorities also gave her 20 minutes to come out and made phone calls to her which she hung up on in an attempt to de-escalate.
27016,That’s fair to enter with guns drawn... further there’s no video evidence of them pointing guns at her kids.
27017,Her husband was upstairs and police have every right to clear the house.
27018,"Finally, let’s question her motivation."
27019,"Her last gofundme raised $250,000."
27020,First thing she does last night?
27021,"Makes another one where she raised $100,000."
27022,Why is everyone so quick to blindly believe her?
27023,She set up that camera to cry wolf on Twitter and get more money because she knows she’ll never be employed again based on her psychopathic criminal history.
27024,No one that received the Oxford vaccine died.
27025,No one.
27026,It prevents serious complications but only stops 60% actually getting the virus.
27027,This sits fine with me.
27028,This is the one I’m likely to get anyway.
27029,You only have so many millions of dollars?
27030,Oxford had seemed like a safer bet at the time.
27031,"In total, the US brought enough vaccines to cover 140% of their population, which is comparable to most European nations that got around 180%."
27032,"(UK and Australia brought around 300%, Canada brought 400%."
27033,Massive-over-buying is much easier when you have a smaller population.)
27034,"And what credentials or relevant professional experience do you have that informs this wild, baseless speculation?"
27035,“Guy at the pub” level science is what got us into this mess.
27036,Wear a mask.
27037,Protect your neighbors.
27038,"I know Covid isn’t the flu, but after a lot of people have gotten vaccinated with 90% effective vaccines, it’s death rate will be at or even well below seasonal flu (which has a very ineffective vaccine)."
27039,People are going to go back to normal once the public has vaccine access and death rates fall to seasonal flu levels of a few thousand a month.
27040,"It doesn’t really matter if there is still Covid, or if you can still spread it."
27041,Once that stage comes this will be ‘over’ for the public
27042,And not all of those are cleared yet.
27043,"I hope you don't beat yourself too much on this, first you need to remember of the many of these countries like Singapore, Taiwan, South Korea, Australia, China, and Vietnam had experience with emerging contagious/deadly diseases before, like SARS, MERS, Nipah Virus, Dengue Fever V3 and Hendravirus all within the span of 20 years."
27044,So in a certain sense those serve as a wake up call for them to constantly update their protocols and be flexible about new threats.
27045,"While the Western hemisphere has been lucky to be shielded and only affected by ""old world diseases"" like measles or the common flu, not so much on exotic diseases."
27046,"Next, if you have read United States's and [CDC pandemic action plans, they are planned for an influenza pandemic](http://National Strategy for Pandemic Influenza - CDC), not a coronavirus pandemic."
27047,"I know this is a saying that is repeated a lot of times, coronavirus is really not like the flu."
27048,"You can easily prepare for flu pandemic because we already have effective anti flu medications like Tami flu, we are pretty knowledgeable about how to treat the flu but before this pandemic, absolutely zero for a coronavirus."
27049,"Since European and America healthcare system was designed for a flu pandemic, is obviously caught them off guard the next airborne pandemic will be a coronavirus."
27050,"You can easily see this on YouTube, most of their rehearsal are for flu, not some strange exotic diseases."
27051,"Even the WHO is trying to push countries to react for [Disease X ](https://www.who.int/activities/prioritizing-diseases-for-research-and-development-in-emergency-contexts)instead of a known disease, because they predicted this outcome."
27052,"Is like you all your life you designed your home to survive a tornado but instead a hurricane decides to hit you instead, you are still gonna gotta pretty wrecked by the floods and your basement can't save you."
27053,"Next, in terms of scale and history of disease studies, COVID 19 being [so easily contagious](https://youtu.be/cXfb2okvzds) and doesn't behave how a normal coronavirus infection plays out, this caught many experts off guard."
27054,Many hospitals were not equipped to handle a disease with this level of spread.
27055,"Remember even countries like [Singapore](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic_in_Singapore), Australia had to go under a lockdown because their original strategies failed."
27056,"In fact, [one of the top disease experts ](https://www.facebook.com/pg/NUSMedicine/photos/?tab=album&amp;album_id=2941972405853207&amp;__xts__%5B0%5D=68.ARClCLogsIf1lfByszJkNmPPOMD8TdwnqyTXrbz5sDmuhMmiNcO256YXKBX84DmZlZ3f9DMbBtC-6CAfKYTQUR_drpnJDlhA873uTNnsfVuBVbBM8CwwSFuPBATuuAf9dN9jHqB6U0eBDKmOL4cGwIbPY74B_RyLTgRLudMGz0G4JCjuWAlNxjWs-dY4W_X-Gje9Ow8vnNKkQaAJ7cl-najM2McigKhm7bGNhpLcJS5tfDAA4prORG_6Bsuv2pXYlNniXrjc52Xlcqw2EXUdgKfIcMdPi8_EhQtcrMn_8D1EnZnFVFjgWx5yj0xLrVPDMNMVlF20VO8-i7xYz1oQs3odBg&amp;__tn__=-UC-R)and the [Prime Minister of Singapore ](https://youtu.be/XaXb85DaTNo) was against general and mass masking because they didn't do that for past disease outbreaks like SARS, 2009 Swine Flu or Nipah Virus and assume what they did was enough."
27057,Turns out they were dead wrong two months later.
27058,Government needs to pass a relief bill to make landlords and mortgage companies whole and extend the eviction moratorium.
27059,I have a tenant in my condo who is about six months behind ($8400).
27060,"If I was not in a good financial position, I would be in really bad shape because I have to pay my $1200/month mortgage and $250 HOA dues every month."
27061,I wouldn't be able to evict him to sell.
27062,I'd just be eating the money until I got foreclosed on.
27063,"Luckily my tenant is cool and will pay back (he fell about six months behind a few years ago when he lost a job and got all caught up), probably at least."
27064,"good thing he didn't have time to ask for a socialist handout


/s 

ugh I feel so nasty writing that sarcastic stuff"
27065,It's absolutely amazing to think we created a vaccine for a virus that we had close to no idea about in that amount of time.
27066,Only 11 months.
27067,Incredible.
27068,"Distribution has literally nothing to do with any of this though, OPs point is that they should've been working on the vaxx distro in oh, idk MARCH."
27069,Oh I understand she is from the north of Ireland but had it in London?
27070,"I mean, this is just false."
27071,"Pfizer arent the only ones making a vaccine, we also have Moderna, J&amp;J, and Oxford."
27072,"Still never got around to watching that, the plot sounds juicy butt every time the paranormal shows or the new SpongeBob movie or more recently the undoing always won out"
27073,That was a mild case.
27074,I didn’t end up in the hospital.
27075,"For the people you know that ended up in the hospital, doesn’t it seem just a little bit worth it for them?"
27076,"Could you show me where he has said children don't spread Covid, and wear masks properly, considering that all children are very well behaved and don't live with anyone at risk?"

27107,"Who tf said july, all current estimates are that the average person will be able to get the vaccine around the beginning of Q2."

27134,"I mean, they've got 40m doses in December."
27135,They will give 40m people the first dose in December.
27136,They will get more doses for the second doses in January.
27137,"If we can wait a few extra weeks for the second dose, that's likely great in terms of logistics/distribution/etc, as more people can get the first dose."
27138,Wait what?
27139,"I’m not anti vax at all, and will most likely be taking this vaccine."

27197,Stifling discussion will only be used by anti-vaxxer’s as further evidence that this is rushed and the government is hiding something.
27198,I wonder if considering the lower effectiveness rate for initial vaccination if this vaccine might work best as a booster down the line.
27199,"70% is enough to be comparable to other vaccines we use in the modern age, and of course we'll use what we can get now, but I'm thinking down the line once the shortages are over and we've vaccinated most of the population who wants to be, and once enough time has passed that boosters are needed."

27220,"Let's not forget that this is a completely new medical technology (mRNA) that hasn't been approved for humans in the past because of issues with toxicity, inflammation, and autoimmunity."
27221,"This absolutely adds even more uncertainty, particularly if we're looking at booster shots, additional injections in the future."
27222,"From the FDA's Dec. 10 briefing document:

&gt;Severe adverse reactions occurred in 0.0-4.6% of participants, were more frequent after Dose 2 than  after Dose 1 and were generally less frequent in older adults (&gt;55  years of age) (&lt;2.8%) as compared to younger participants (≤4.6%)."

27239,I'll just laugh at people who won't get the vaccine.
27240,Didn’t Russians get vaccinated a couple of months ago with the barely tested home-grown vaccine?
27241,I remember the photo-op of Putin getting his shot?
27242,"The AZ numbers are fine, they instead are just running a trial to see if their part of the og trial (the half dose then full dose error) is as effective to what the data showed  


The normal trial with regular doses is fine and the data and scientists seem to be backing it up, and you most likely won't be able to pick and choose what vaccine you get"
27243,"The poster said:

&gt;STILL no ones gotten it yet, but in other countries like the UK they're already vaccinating

The reason the UK is already vaccinating is because they already approved it."
27244,"Nobody in the US has gotten it because it's not approved yet, not because they don't have a distribution plan."
27245,Each US state creates their own distribution plan and executes based on how much gets allocated.
27246,Those plans were submitted back in October and I'm sure they have to be continuously updated/refined as new information comes out.

27249,All of society works this way.
27250,Plenty of old remedies would never be approved if they were formulated for the first time today--we accept known risks over unknown ones as a matter of rote course.
27251,"It's not particularly logical, but it also seems to be a part of our societal nature."
27252,What makes this substantially different than trial participants getting the vaccine?
27253,I assume the patient has to assume less of a risk than the trial participants would?
27254,I do not blindly believe her.
27255,"There is a media bubble around her and she thinks it will protect her, but the facts about IP addresses mean one side or the other is blatantly lying and will get busted soon enough."

27257,"""She is a media hack"" is not really relevant to having guns out."
27258,Interesting.
27259,"It doesn't do much against getting infected, 
but against symptoms and severe disease, it's very effective."

27272,"You even have your Whitehouse press secretary trying to get the phrase""Trump Vaccine"" to catch on."
27273,AND you don't bother buying the vaccine once it's available.
27274,"Yeah, that is how it would go anyway."
27275,"Friday is the 11th, 21 days later is New Years day, January."
27276,So by then there should be some ramp up in production for the second dose.
27277,What we need to know is if we can wait on the second dose for like an extra month.
27278,That would have huge impact on the number of people we can vaccinate successfully.
27279,"Getting Covid MAY prove more harmful, or even fatal."
27280,"My biggest retort is this, what about the long term risks of Covid infection is really known and assured?"
27281,I’ve got a friend who has lost his sense of smell since March.
27282,"He was a foodie,  he’s so annoyed."
27283,It has not improved more than a little bit that came back 2 weeks after his infection.
27284,Thinking of the west vs China what will be the implications in 25 years if 40% of our current population has had Covid and only 2% of theirs has had it?
27285,These are important questions in both directions.
27286,I’m actually hopeful of no long term societal side effects of Covid but to act like it’s a natural thing and that therefore it just needs to run it’s course without preferring to stop our population from getting it is Definitely a gamble that goes beyond the immediate IFR.
27287,But these people are heroes!

27362,The only thing that has scared me about all of this is the 1918 precedent of later waves being worse for some reason even though that shouldn't normally be the case.
27363,I read early speculation that previous exposure to the disease could cause worse symptoms on later waves after sufficient time had passed to cause the reduction of enough immune response to flatly fight off the disease.
27364,Has that ever been mentioned again?
27365,Well you won’t be laughing in June....maybe by July.
27366,Not allowing discussion on the negative side effects of the vaccine is extremely immoral and can do more harm than good.
27367,There's a difference between anti-vaxxer and asking what are the possible side effects of a completely new vaccine delivery method.
27368,If valid discussion around the medical ramifications of an mRNA vaccine aren't allowed to be discussed (like the lab leak origin hypothesis) you are going to have a large percentage of the population not willing to trust the vaccine.
27369,There's an extremely good chance that the side effects are mild.
27370,But there isn't enough data to say it's 100% safe.
27371,And after all what medication is 100% safe?
27372,Even birth control which is pretty mild of a medication has to be prescribed and comes with a risk of side effects.

27425,Their vaccine has burdensome shipping and storage requirements versus the 100+ competing vaccines.
27426,The popularity might be like a shooting star.
27427,There have been many posts on this sub where people would prefer to stay isolated and not get the vaccine.
27428,I agree that the majority fit into those two groups though.
27429,Smfh first we have to get 2 shots now it’s 150 million
27430,A lot of people are scared to take it as they are worried it MAY prove harmful.
27431,What would you say to those people to convince them otherwise?
27432,"Haha no, I was just being a little shit."
27433,Figured it was a feature British English
27434,"How has that gone for you guys, so far?"
27435,"All that lying, which you are advocating, is counter productive."

27445,They are taking into account that sometimes things happen outside of their control.
27446,If they distribute all 40 million vaccines and then something happens with the 2nd batch that delays or cancels it then they have a problem.
27447,We are only worried about hospital capacity.
27448,The government definitely doesn't care about the people who refused the vaccine getting sick and they will only pretend to care about the immune comprised but they will not be stopping any economic growth to keep those people alive.

27528,Long-COVID.
27529,Could the vaccine potentially cause this as well?

27557,I swear I see it in almost every thread lately about news/Covid/politics and I’d rarely ever heard it at any time prior to the last month or so.
27558,I think it’s too harsh for force a newlywed couple to limit the number of attendees.
27559,To tell a friend that they’re not invited to their wedding would be extremely rude.
27560,"If your BFF told you that you can’t come to their wedding out of coronavirus precautions, could you possibly accept that?"

27568,Crimes against humanity.
27569,"If anything Americans deserve the vaccine last, since our government has politicized it so much."
27570,"Making vaccines free (and I mean completely free, no extras at all like in the US) helps get rid of a lot of administration and can speed things up."
27571,And I bet it helps a lot when coordinating such a large project to have everyone part of the same company.
27572,"For example, they can redeploy NHS staff into other roles and areas if needed."
27573,They have already been doing this to help catch up on the standard vaccine schedules that were disrupted due to Covid.
27574,They got NHS staff who would usually be doing something else to help the immunisation teams.
27575,I reckon they'll be doing this again when they roll Covid vaccines out further.

27589,It needs a lot more trial and shoring up their studies.
27590,There were questions before as thier data has been confusing.
27591,"Then they come out with ambiguous ""upto 90%"" efficacy but oh not really."
27592,The half dose full dose was very small group and can't be designated as main dosing.
27593,Or shouldn't be at least.
27594,"Also very concerning is the AZ statement that the half dose regimen was an accident and ""serendipity""."
27595,A lucky accident means the trial has been compromised.
27596,Deviation is not a good thing.
27597,Doubt or lost faith could be a killer to vaccination rates.
27598,"If we didn't have pfizer or moderna,  it might be a different story."
27599,So why do we need two doses then?

27625,My buddy who absolutely hates Trudeau's guts for a bunch of insane reasons just finished texting me how Canada is nearly last in line to get any vaccines and other 3rd world countries will be ahead in the queue.

27627,Radio silence.
27628,[Archive link](https://archive.is/eURSn) to the article for those that need it.
27629,I don't really see a benefit.
27630,You're just taking a vaccine away from someone who has no antibodies.
27631,But there could be a benefit for you that I'm not aware of.
27632,I lost a lot of respect for television doctors telling people not to wear masks in the beginning.
27633,"I get there was a mask shortage, but as we saw people figured out how to make them."
27634,I was watching them in disbelief.
27635,I think they helped send this into a anti mask mind set in this country.

27648,Hardly “the first 6-8 weeks of the pandemic”.
27649,By late august HCQ had been thoroughly discredited.
27650,It was nothing more than a vanity purchase to make trump feel smarter than the experts.
27651,Sure.
27652,"The FDA also isn’t sure if it’s safe for people under 16, pregnant women and people with a compromised immune system."

27659,Yet people call it a plandemic or won’t take the vaccine.
27660,A lot of stupid people in the world.
27661,Because (like Japan) they have a really good handle on who comes in and are a much more homogeneous country.

27666,Kinda puts all the politicians refusing to enforce the mask mandate into perspective.
27667,Idk if a two week shut down can slow any of this down.
27668,There are more field hospitals and mobile morgues popping up more than ever before.
27669,Cases became high because in the early Spring there was no shocking death rate.

27693,Oxford said they can do 3 billion doses which is double that of moderna or pfizer.

27734,"https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.10.19.20214494v1

It specifically says it's not peer reviewed yet and is a preprint."

27736,Will have to sift through the other links later.

27738,"Cool, good luck finding a legal basis for why that ""subverting herd immunity"" would be on the prohibited-reason list."
27739,"Maybe the federal and state governments should have done some planning for an event like this, perhaps they should have funded schools to the extent that they are able to accomplish this task in a way that is effective."

27777,"#  Findings are important for vaccines, therapeutics and public health strategies to combat the COVID-19 pandemic 

&gt;Since the novel coronavirus emerged at the end of  last year, scientists around the world -- including Beth Israel  Deaconess Medical Center (BIDMC) immunologist Dan Barouch, MD, PhD --  have been developing vaccines to protect against COVID-19 and to put an  end to the global pandemic."
27778,"As of November 2020, three pharmaceutical  companies released early data showing high rates of protection in Phase 3  human trials for their vaccines, but questions remain about how the  body develops and maintains immunity after vaccination or infection."
27779,"&gt;  
&gt;In a new paper in the journal *Nature*, Barouch, Director of  BIDMC's Center for Virology and Vaccine Research, and colleagues shed  light on the role of antibodies and immune cells in protection against  SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, in rhesus macaques."
27780,"""In this  study, we define the role of antibodies versus T cells in protection  against COVID-19 in monkeys."
27781,"We report that a relatively low antibody  titer (the concentration of antibodies in the blood) is needed for  protection,"" said Barouch."
27782,"""Such knowledge will be important in the  development of next generation vaccines, antibody-based therapeutics,  and public health strategies for COVID-19."""
27783,"&gt;  
&gt;Building on previous findings that SARS-CoV-2 infection protects  rhesus monkeys from re-exposure, Barouch and colleagues purified and  collected antibodies from animals that had recovered from infection."
27784,They administered the antibodies at various concentrations to 12  uninfected macaques and observed that protection against SARS-CoV-2  challenge was dose dependent.
27785,"Animals that received higher amounts of  antibodies were protected more completely, while animals that received  lower amounts of antibodies were protected less well."
27786,"Similarly, when  the researchers administered various concentrations of the purified  antibodies to 6 macaques with active SARS-CoV-2 infection, those given  higher doses demonstrated more rapid viral control."
27787,"&gt;  
&gt;In a second set of experiments, Barouch and colleagues evaluated the  role of specific immune cells -- CD8+ T cells -- in contributing to  protection against the virus by removing these cells from animals that  had recovered from SARS-CoV-2 infection."
27788,Removal of these immune cells  left the animals vulnerable to infection after re-exposure to  SARS-CoV-2.
27789,"&gt;  
&gt;""Our data define the role of antibodies and T cells in protection  against COVID-19 in monkeys."
27790,"Antibodies alone can protect, including at  relatively low levels, but T cells are also helpful if antibody levels  are insufficient,"" said Barouch, who is also Professor of Medicine at  Harvard Medical School, and a member of the Ragon Institute of MGH, MIT,  and Harvard."
27791,"""Such correlates of protection are important given the  recent successful vaccine results from human trials, and the likelihood  that these and other vaccines will become widely available in the  spring; as a result future vaccines may need to be licensed based on  immune correlates rather than clinical efficacy."""

27811,I disagree.
27812,Precautions can be taken against coronavirus to protect physical health.
27813,Total shutdowns and separation from family is a great way to destroy mental health though.
27814,"Take my sister for example, squarely in the lowest risk age group."
27815,She actually got coronavirus and it had almost no effect on her.
27816,Her mental health has suffered from the lockdowns though.
27817,Not being able to see her family over breaks would destroy her.
27818,Hospitals required the flu vaccine this year for nurses no matter what.
27819,they did in my area anyway.
27820,"I hear what your saying but none of the assumptions you’ve mentioned is covered in the article and all that does is induce fear for those that may not be for the vaccine for medical, religious, etc reasons."
27821,My wife and I are currently trying to have a baby and have no idea what the affect of that vaccine will be.
27822,There are 0 studies on that.
27823,So now I just lose my job?
27824,What about women that are breast feeding?
27825,Out of a job?
27826,That’s ridiculous.
27827,And the “go find another job” comment is incredibly unrealistic to people living in the real world and not their mothers basement
27828,JNJ and Oxford may be months away.
27829,So while we will get them (if their clinical trials succeed and they get FDA approval) this will slow down the vaccine rollout in the US.
27830,"So if this article is correct, we can vaccinate 50 mil with Pfizer this year/early next, I think 20 mil with Moderna, then whatever Moderna can produce until JNJ and/or Oxford can get in the game."

28031,But other places in the world have already approved and started using other vaccines.
28032,"I understand that our countries may not approve those vaccines, and that they may not be so reliable."
28033,But that doesn’t mean that this is the “first” one.
28034,"Again, I fully understand the context."
28035,It is that the headlines that are categorically wrong and completely neglect other countries in the world.
28036,And I don’t think that is good in many levels that I can’t fully develop here.
28037,"Please don’t take it wrong, I am celebrating today."
28038,It is just a comment about our extremely self centred vision of the world that we could improve.
28039,Yeah like I said one good thing I had on my side was knowledge of how to treat this.
28040,Cold turkey=hell on earth or death.
28041,Feel bad for the people out there who don’t have my wife to baby me and the resources we have to fight alcohol use disorder when I get these fucking every few year cravings.
28042,Lot of people are just dropping.
28043,"So basically - as long as you’re ok, you don’t care if you infect others?"
28044,People with that attitude should be the last to receive the vaccine.
28045,That won't fly.
28046,Cases are up 25% already compared to last week.
28047,"Also the proposition the article is talking about is aimed at 2021, and the more economy oriented ministers are constantly in a fight with the more health oriented minister."
28048,"Their weekly Corona meeting are like civilized fights, and releasing these kinds of public propositions are meant to put pressure on the health oriented ministers."
28049,And most employers will reimburse you that £8 too
28050,Which is incredible considering the impact it will have immediately on at risk populations.
28051,Strawman logical error.
28052,Your brain is broken..
28053,"With CDC's flip-flop and inconsistent message, I can see why the rest aren't taking it seriously."
28054,There should be university classes with CDC's bungled PR response as a case-study on what not to do in public crisis.
28055,"You might want to take your concerns about health to a health professional, not random people on the internet."
28056,Vaccine side effects are being made clear to anyone paying attention.
28057,They should've bought up to 650M of each.
28058,The cost is peanuts compared to the benefit.
28059,Somehow covid became politicized.
28060,I still don't fully understand why it needed to be.
28061,"As it became politicized, people believed the liberal media tried to scare America into thinking covid was really bad and out of control."
28062,"Conservative media downplayed it, both to contrast liberal media and to defend Trump."
28063,And that just spiraled out of control into more polarization.
28064,"At this point people almost have to believe it's just like a minor flu, otherwise they would have to accept the fact that our nation's response has been garbage."
28065,&gt; We can manufacture war equipment on a massive scale when needed but we draw the line on vaccines.
28066,Which also took 2-3 years to scale up...
28067,52% effective just to be clear
28068,The latest disinformation is that the vaccine was given to a six year old girl and she died.
28069,"You know, during the child vaccination campaign we all missed in November."
28070,"Again, Pfizer is not the only company producing vaccines, we will also have Moderna this Month also, then in January/February we should see approval of J&amp;J and the AstraZeneca vaccine."
28071,"And those two are huge as they can be made very quickly, and J&amp;J is only a 1 dose vaccine."
28072,Yes it’s like a flu vaccine immunity.
28073,Not great but helpful.
28074,I am wondering whether we could start doing 2 doses for the flu too
28075,"“Some are born great, some achieve greatness, and some have greatness thrust upon them.”"
28076,If it was up to me everyone would have to have the vaccine before they could go to work.
28077,If you're not an anti vaxxer I'm sure you agree anti-vaxxers are stupid people.
28078,Is it possible to get covid walking past someone outdoors who is blowing their nose while your wearing a mask?
28079,My neighbor swears she got covid this way.
28080,But she also goes shopping a lot.
28081,Of course there is mutations.
28082,The amount of mutations is staggering to look at to the layman when the graphs of them are compiled.
28083,But compared to the flu it is still minuscule luckily
28084,"I really hope that if they build that monument it becomes just another monument in Montevideo's coast, I don't want my country's death numbers to increase and give people a reason to visit it."
28085,We don't know enough yet to tell people that have had Covid that they are immune now.
28086,Worldometers has the US at 16 million total cases.
28087,That’s 5% of the country

28108,What's your point exactly.
28109,"China makes some very high quality stuff, but if you choose to buy the cheap shit that's on you not then."
28110,Yeah I took the long way home the other week and there is a creek that runs parallel to the road.
28111,"Up ahead there were five or six police cars, highway patrol, undercover car, and the game/fish warden car."
28112,"Between the creek and the roadway, a man had erected a makeshift tent and had a little camp set up there in the woods."
28113,They were removing him and his tent stuff.
28114,This was out in the middle of nowhere.
28115,Too slow.
28116,They should've met two weeks ago.
28117,Even with a mask your eyes are still wide open (without face shield) so in your example you are going out in the cold with a winter jacket but no pants or underwear
28118,Publish a paper saying we tested for all of these side effects and list them in a table with notes if they are possible to happen or not when you get the vaccine
28119,Bill Gates too!
28120,"Putting aside that's literally how double-blind trials work, looking at it, (I'm assuming this is the part you mean) one part says 
   
&gt; When a COVID-19 vaccine is available under an EUA, placebo recipients who choose not to remain in the ongoing study will need to be unblinded to determine whether they received BNT162b2 or placebo, and given the option to receive BNT162b2 when they are practically eligible for a COVID 19 vaccine (ie, eligible under applicable regulatory approval and national immunization recommendations, and when the national program supply is available in the area in which they reside)."
28121,"In this situation, it is Pfizer’s preference that such individuals are vaccinated within the study in order that both safety and efficacy data can continue to be collected."
28122,"We believe this approach will minimize the number of current participants who choose to withdraw from the study once a vaccine is available and will maximize the collection of data that can inform the long-term efficacy and safety of BNT162b2
   
What specifically is the issue here?"
28123,The headline is a little misleading.
28124,It makes it sound like you might only need one dose but in the article it said the 1st dose provided 52% protection whereas getting the second ups that to 95% which at least to me is huge difference unless I am reading the story wrong.
28125,"It's not tested so the answer will be no for a while, we will not have time or distribution to analyze."
28126,It won't be recommended because they don't know of any side effects or how effective they would be.
28127,"But seems like there wouldn't do any harm, just a bit of unknown in effectiveness."
28128,The logistics are supposed to take care of the 2nd dose.
28129,If they fail at being consistent and following the procedure we will be in trouble.
28130,(I guess some falls on the patient to report back to same location which I suppose could become an issue for some).
28131,But the OP says we need 70%.
28132,Thats big chuck to throwaway
28133,It's not that simple.
28134,"You need a Bio tech production facility that has the ability to properly store these things as soon as they are made, and in huge quantities."
28135,"You can't just build those facilities overnight, or use companies not already in that industry to speed up the process."
28136,"Meh, the original comment was not racist, just stupid."
28137,I mean its looking like J&amp;J and AZ will be looking for approval around the same time as AZ pretty much had to do a whole new trial.
28138,And j&amp;j is doing a huge 60k person study.
28139,You'll have to get through our weaponized beaver defense first.

28145,"I am in the ""How can we know this vaccine won't have long-term side effects if it has been tested for only a few months""."
28146,I honestly do not know what to do anymore.
28147,Since you're just getting downvoted I figured I'd mention that they weren't saying 1 shot + 5 weeks = immunity.
28148,They were saying immunity 5 weeks after the FIRST shot.
28149,1 shot + 4 weeks + booster shot + additional week = immunity.
28150,That's what they are implying.
28151,beginning of the end
28152,True story
28153,"&gt; ize that coronaviruses mutatation rate is several order of magnitude slower than seasonal influenza, right?"
28154,NO mutations have been found that would bypass the vaccine target spike protein.
28155,"Not being argumentative, but in the breakout for the Baltimore Ravens it was reported that 4 strains of the virus were found."
28156,"No doubt it doesn't mutate anywhere near the rates of the flu, but it is mutating."
28157,Good to read the vaccines would work against all of these.
28158,https://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/30454991/at-least-four-strains-covid-19-found-baltimore-ravens-facility
28159,Lol what?
28160,"Regardless of how well the vaccines do, I'm keeping a mask on me well after this pandemic is over"
28161,Then say so in the title.
28162,Better yet lets lockdown America again.
28163,"Lets ask Gov Newsome of CA how he feels about that, since he likes to break rules - even his own."
28164,Labcorp.
28165,"Signed up online, they have a doctor who submitted the test orders, I went to a testing center (which had an insanely small waiting room and was a COVID crockpot in its own right...), got the blood draw, and had my results less than 24 hours."
28166,I believe it was all covered by insurance.

28168,Looks like it's just going to be me and my parents and our cats.
28169,I'm allowed to come over as I.. well my job allows me to essentially see no one ever.
28170,My temperament over the years allows me to not really miss human company.
28171,"I would very much like human company, but I can survive without it."
28172,Anyway..
28173,I just hope my parents get the vaccine soon.
28174,Does the baby have antibodies?
28175,"You're right, that's why they have to apply for emergency use and what evidence they have must be overwhelming."
28176,"'we did a meta study of a bunch of observational studies that showed maybe it helped some people"" wouldn't fly."
28177,Stupid question...
28178,But If this and Moderna show 80 percent effacacy after one shot doesn't that at least beg the question of doing one shot dosage until supplies are more readily available?
28179,INJECT ME VACCINE DADDY!
28180,Except I’m pretty sure in trials you go into it knowing that there’s a chance you got nothing.
28181,I had a hysterectomy and I use condoms.
28182,"So, yes, dude."
28183,Because this isn't about your body alone.
28184,The restrictions we have now better become simply “guidelines” by the time the vulnerable get their shots and hospitalizations/deaths plummet.
28185,"There better not be any restrictions on me, a vaccinated individual, going to packed concerts and music festivals, stadiums, bars with friends, and traveling among many other things by the summertime."
28186,"Anyone who chooses not to be vaccinated by the time they are widely available also chooses to accept the consequences of that, and the rest of society should not be held back because of the choices of these people."
28187,By that point ALL restrictions must be lifted and any resistance from governments to do so will be met with increasing unrest
28188,I'm in toronto so we have had gyms lockdown/semi lockdown since march with a small window in august when we had 80 cases in Ontario total.
28189,"Yesterday we had something like 1900..   


People just need to chill and stop meeting up so we can all get back to normal."
28190,R number here in toronto = 1.13.

28193,Coventry is gonna be in the history books for another reason!
28194,it requires a 2nd dose 3 weeks after the first dose and then an additional week...So about a month after the first dose
28195,Sole-sourced from Pfizer or am I wrong-informed?
28196,Not the best analogy... imagine if your wife could get other women pregnant by hanging out with them too soon after having sex with you.
28197,Thats the worry.
28198, Person makes adjustment tondo their job.
28199,It would have been more poetic.
28200,OK...Now.
28201,Who is not going to take the vaccine?
28202,Nice 😎
28203,Woot.
28204,"*Here is the new update from* **Sweden (2020-12-08, Tuesday)**:

Briefings are on Tuesday and Thursday, number updates are from Tuesday until Friday."
28205,"Today is the first update for the week and since last Friday:

====

* Numbers at a glance (previously in the post title): **297732** (+18820) confirmed cases and **7200** (+133) deaths since Friday."
28206,"* Current 14-day incidence in Sweden is 696 per 100.000, an increase from last Tuesday's 660 of about 5.5%."
28207,"The increase between the Tuesday before that was over 8%, so this is somewhat encouraging development that corresponds to the reported observations of slowdown in Europe and Sweden and potential plateau."
28208,"* The age groups in which the spread is still highest - double than the rest is 20-59 years old with about 500-600 per 100.000, while in the rest of the age groups it is about 200 with a bit more elevated for 60-69 at close to 300."
28209,In the 0-19 age group there is also a gradient that increases the spread with the older ages.
28210,* For several regions the curves of new confirmed cases are shown.
28211,Skåne has 14-day incidence rate of 959 and still relatively linear increase in the weekly new confirmed cases with week 49 being at about 7000/week.
28212,"Sörmland has a definitive drop in the curve for the past two weeks, from 800-week in week 47 to below 600 in week 49 and 14-day incidence of 385 per 100.000."
28213,There is great variation in the development and level of infection between the regions in the country.
28214,* A potential plateau is observed in the new ICU admissions as well.
28215,"It is reported as ""potential"" as the results from the last two weeks are marked as still unconfirmed."
28216,The last three weeks average new admissions to ICU have varied around 150/week.
28217,"As comparison, at the two weeks peak in spring the new ICU admissions we over 270/week."
28218,* 250 patients are in ICU with COVID-19 based on the data from the ICU register (see links below).
28219,"674 ICU beds with respirator is the current capacity in Sweden (has been increasing a bit over the last weeks), 548 are occupied."
28220,46% of the capacity currently is taken by COVID-19 patients.
28221,"In hospital care, but outside of ICU, there are 1906 patients with COVID-19."
28222,"* Socialstyrelsen is starting a new training today about hygiene routines targeted at social care homes, elderly homes and home care."
28223,The educational course is available on the portal and is for free.
28224,"They also remind people of two important things: first is to seek care if you are ill. Second is to donate blood if you are healthy, as blood centers have routines for you to be able to do that safely."
28225,* **From 14 December a new tightened general advice will be in effect across the entire country**.
28226,Official information in swedish is available [here](https://www.folkhalsomyndigheten.se/nyheter-och-press/nyhetsarkiv/2020/december/begransa-ditt-umgange-till-en-mindre-krets-under-storhelgerna/) and [here](https://www.folkhalsomyndigheten.se/smittskydd-beredskap/utbrott/aktuella-utbrott/covid-19/skydda-dig-och-andra/jul-och-andra-hogtider/).
28227,"Minister of Social Affairs Lena Hallengren (S) summarized the tightened national councils in an earlier press conference as follow:  
\- You are obliged to take precautions to prevent covid-19 infection."
28228,\- You must keep your distance.
28229,"\- You should stay home if you are ill.  
As a note, more specific points are outlined in the official information."
28230,"General advice is a higher level governmental ""order"" than the recommendations that were used in spring."
28231,* **The restriction of a maximum of eight people in crowds will remain over Christmas and New Year** was also announced in an earlier press conference.
28232,\- Celebrate Christmas with a small circle of people.
28233,Eight people is the norm for all social situations.
28234,"Avoid new contacts, meet for a short time, keep your distance, meet outdoors, avoid shops, trains and buses, says Prime Minister Stefan Löfven (S)."
28235,"State epidemiologist Anders Tegnell has previously answered the question of whether children are included in eight people as follows:  
\- Yes."
28236,"* The death curve is still increasing (keeping in mind that the last two weeks are not completely reported yet) at a relatively linear rate (+70-80/week) since week 44, reaching 315/week in week 47 and week 48 albeit not yet complete is also already at 306."
28237,* 133 new deaths were added to the totals today (first report since Friday).
28238,"Six of them were added to the number of deaths without confirmed date (currently 26 total), and the rest are distributed mostly between 24/11 and 7/12, with three older deaths added to 12/11, 19/11 and 22/11."
28239,"Regions with more than 5 new deaths from today's report are: Jöngköping +9, Skåne +26, Stockholm +41, Uppsala +17, Västerbotten +5, Västra Götaland +6, Östergötland +7."
28240,"In age groups 10 deaths are 20-69, 70-79 are 26, 80-89 are 68 and 90+ are 29."
28241,"Today there are a lot of extensive questions and answers between the authority representatives and journalists, I'll post these in a separate post below."
28242,"====

**Please, remember there is lag in reporting and deaths reported on a certain day are usually mostly deaths that happened on previous days."
28243,"On average it takes up to 11 days to report 90% of the deaths for a certain day (see in the links graphs about how that looks)**

28254,What did she do besides 'illegally' releasing actual COVID numbers in 'Death' Desantis' state?
28255,Lol if you were dumb enough to have 10 kids you have other problems.
28256,You’re probably stupid enough to deny COVID exists.
28257,&gt; We are taking her at her word that her children were up there.
28258,Hopefully the cops were wearing body cams and the footage will be released.
28259,It's worth noting that the cops were outside her door for twenty minutes asking her to come out.
28260,"While I 100% think most cops are assholes and use way too much force, if they were really outside for 20 minutes indicates they weren't looking for a violent confrontation, and of course it means her and her family members could have just walked outside in response to the valid warrant."
28261,This also of course does not mean I am on DeSantis's side.
28262,"It's quite possible this is a gestapo type operation to intimidate her, she just doesn't come off as very stable so I don't necessarily buy her side of the story."
28263,"On another note, she was fired 6 months ago."
28264,"Now that she has been running her own dashboard for 6 months, have we seen any sort of analysis comparing her numbers to the states?"
28265,This will probably make me look stupid but I just wanted to ask.

I figured it wasn't a big deal, but I would like someone to explain to me why lol"
28268,"You obviously had other concerns at the time, but the cops should pursue this, not the hospital that obviously does not care."
28269,Would you take the Russian vaccine?
28270,well i just hope the vaccine doesnt cause my body to suddenly trigger SIRS and then sepsis if I ignore it....I doubt Ill ignore it but still....a personal concern.
28271,Why aren't they approving the Oxford one?
28272,Isn't 60% good enough?

Sheriff Murphy Recovering After Testing Positive For COVID-19
December 8, 2020

Livingston County (Michigan) Sheriff Mike Murphy says he has tested positive for COVID-19."
28360,"Murphy says he began to experience symptoms around Thanksgiving and tested positive on the following Sunday, November 30th with a rapid test, which was confirmed with a positive nasal swab test last week."
28361,Murphy says he and his wife Penny have been quarantining at home.
28362,"While she did not get tested, as a close contact she is presumed to also be positive."
28363,"Murphy told WHMI that the symptoms have been mild and he considers himself fortunate, but says it, “bums me out because we have been pretty careful.” However, he expects to be back to work by Thursday."
28364,**Murphy made headlines earlier this year when he announced that his office would not enforce Democratic Gov.
28365,Gretchen Whitmer's stay-at-home order.
28366,"** At the time, Murphy, a lifelong Republican and one time chair of the Livingston County Republican Party, said the decision was not politically motivated."

28555,&gt;This information was obtained from documents released on Tuesday by the FDA.
28556,&gt;The documents were released ahead of a meeting on Thursday of outside experts who will debate whether emergency authorization for the vaccine should be granted.
28557,"&gt;The FDA also said on Tuesday that the data they're presented with is in line with emergency use authorization, raising hopes for Thursday."
28558,"&gt;At the same time, the FDA said that there currently is not enough research to guarantee the vaccine's safety for immunocompromised groups, pregnant women and children."
28559,"&gt;Israel’s Midaat Association responded to the report on the deaths, explaining that when vaccines are administered to at-risk populations “there may be unfortunate cases."
28560,One should not infer from this about the safety of the vaccine but welcome the transparency required from the pharma companies in the drug approval process.”
28561,"Because as Fauci said, our review process is more thorough"
28562,"Here's the latest case/death charts for Harris county (Houston):

[https://www.statmap.org/?LOCALE=Harris:TX#data](https://www.statmap.org/?LOCALE=Harris:TX#data)

On the face of it, they're actually doing okay (by US standards)."
28563,Their 7-day death curve is way down.
28564,And they're only at 65.53 deaths per 100k.
28565,The US per capita average is 65.53.
28566,"And they rank 1,664th among US counties for per capita deaths:

[https://www.statmap.org/rankedcounties.html](https://www.statmap.org/rankedcounties.html)"
28567,And it’s not like those extra doses are worthless if approval comes later or a product is less effective than another we have available.
28568,"They could be distributed as aid, or at the very least allow other countries to take over those orders at cost."
28569,What the actual fuck.. dystopian shit.

28571,Germany's federal structure prevents Merkel from just doing it.
28572,She has been putting pressure on state leaders to approve additional measures for some time now.
28573,There will be other vaccines ramped up.
28574,I'm glad it isn't.
28575,Most other countries have seen the pain and have learnt from it.
28576,White America just continues to hate and hate more.
28577,At some point the majority of white America will put aside their rage and choose to help one another.

28587,"I don’t need to tell you, the New York Times did, and I linked to it in the comment you are replying to."
28588,You could try reading it?
28589,"Also, the article you linked to is several weeks old."
28590,Only 100 million of the doses mentioned are from Pfizer.
28591,"In those several weeks since that article, there have been other articles rolling back how many they would be providing to the US."
28592,Probably was the vaccine then.
28593,Do you know when you can expect to know?
28594,Thanks for taking part in these trials.

28607,"You were right, deaths are higher than last week."
28608,Yeah that looks like it's all information pertaining to 2019 pre-pandemic.
28609,"From what I understand there's not a lot of published information on what the impact of the pandemic has been on things like domestic violence, addiction, overdoses, etc... just a lot of fear and anxiety that it's going to severely exacerbate those situations."
28610,"I think it's easy to draw conclusions based on our assumptions and historically what has happened during times of isolation in the past, but 2020 has not been the year to rely on anything we assume we know, and circumstances are quite a bit different than most people alive have experienced (at least in the US)."
28611,"There may be factors at play that may mitigate some of the compounding effects of having people isolate together, e.g., authority figures trying to enable lock-down procedures may be seen as assailants and attention may be directed there instead of at others, who knows honestly, just spitballing here."
28612,It's going to be interesting once we can start to study the effects and impacts for sure.
28613,"Most Americans care, our government on the other hand......"
28614,"I'm currently working at a facility with an outbreak and you're right, the staff are bringing it in."
28615,"In the case with the facility I'm at, a colleague's son contracted it at work and went home to his mom who then contracted it and brought it to a care home."
28616,"The mother did everything correctly, to the best of their ability."
28617,They're under the same roof and can't be expected to isolate from each other.
28618,"We aren't asking that of the general public, either."
28619,I'm not sure what more this family could have done.
28620,Thankfully my colleague wore proper PPE and the residents were left unscathed.
28621,Another staff member did become infected but we think the point of contact was from sharing a computer or sitting 6 feet away from each other in the lunch room.
28622,Its hard to say.
28623,"I too was wondering how so many care homes become infected but now after being so closely in contact with this staff member, I think the only way to halt it would be a complete lock down."
28624,Limiting social contact isn't enough.
28625,When are people going to understand that we're greater when we work together than when we try to stand all on our own?
28626,"You can not seriously still think, after everything we've learned about this pandemic, that it's just like the ""flu."""
28627,"I honestly don't even know what to say to people who still think this, because it's so mind numbingly not in touch with reality."
28628,The flu in the United States kills as most 60k people per year.
28629,COVID-19 has killed 283k in nine months.

28660,We can't just blame gun-toting Trump voter hillbilly folk with 8th grade educations.
28661,This sentiment is VERY widespread.
28662,"Literally talks about this in the article:

“He added: “2,697 deaths had Covid on the death certificate, and it is important to note that these are not just deaths ‘with’ Covid."
28663,"Eighty-eight per cent of the Covid deaths, that is 2,361 people, were deaths ‘from’ Covid as the main underlying cause, only 12 per cent were ‘with’ Covid as a secondary cause.”"
28664,The flu kills between 9-15k a year in the US when using confirmed cases which is the only metric we have for covid.
28665,"So, yes, it’s already caused 30x more deaths than the flu for a low flu year and around 18x versus a big flu year."
28666,Edit: actually flu deaths are even lower based on this article.
28667,https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/observations/comparing-covid-19-deaths-to-flu-deaths-is-like-comparing-apples-to-oranges/
28668,Exactly.
28669,"Curfews, restaurants and bars."
28670,"Also, compared to the first wave, everybody (sort of) have masks now."

28682,People like you actually make me sick.
28683,"The epitome of the reason why we are still at what, month 10 of this bullshit?"
28684,While the majority of the world sees it as a thing of past because of eliminating the virus and not needing a vaccine for active immunity to push us back to normal.
28685,"But then again, its not just you."
28686,Its people who think like you.
28687,And people who think like you are the same politicians playing games.
28688,The flu vaccine doesn’t PREVENT you from getting it.
28689,You also probably havent gotten it because you haven’t been around people who have the flu.
28690,Because they probably get their flu shot every year like an educated human :)

28888,This guy said he won't get the vaccine himself.
28889,Oddly he said he'd give it to his kid.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Chinese vaccine maker [Sinovac Biotech Ltd.](https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/SVA:US)’s coronavirus shot created antibodies among 97% of those administered with it in a final stage trial in Indonesia but its efficacy has yet to be determined, a company spokesperson said Tuesday."
28964,"&gt;  
&gt;The clarification came after Sinovac’s Indonesian partner, [PT Bio Farma](https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/1651555D:IJ), said that the vaccine had proven 97% effective in early clinical trials there."

&gt;Now, I’ve seen people speculating this morning that these numbers may be better than they look, because they believe that these trials monitored patients by PCR tests rather than by symptoms."
28972,"If that were the case, then yes, that’s a finer net than the Pfizer and Moderna trials used and it would certainly affect the efficacy readouts."
28973,"But I don’t think it is: looking at the [**published trial protocol**](https://s3.amazonaws.com/ctr-med-7111/D8110C00001/52bec400-80f6-4c1b-8791-0483923d0867/c8070a4e-6a9d-46f9-8c32-cece903592b9/D8110C00001_CSP-v2.pdf) for the US trial, the cases are defined as “SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR-positive symptomatic illness”, and the patients have to show symptoms of the disease (see Table 13)."
28974,"*Update: I have been unable to find published protocols for the UK/Brazil/South Africa trials that went into today’s numbers, but I have no reason to think that they differ on this point*."
28975,So I don’t think we can explain the lower efficacy by saying that they were finding asymptomatic people as well: the trial excludes asymptomatic people from its endpoint definition.
28976,The rate of asymptomatic cases in the treatments and controls will be determined in these trials (see section 8.5.2.1 of the protocol) but those aren’t the numbers we’re seeing today.
28977,"Yes, but who in their mind would want an inferior vaccine that protects only 62% when you can just choose the other free vaccine which is 95% good?"
28978,I'm not an antivaxx proponent.

29058,"AZ is also redoing their study data, because they had unexpected results with an accidental misdose of the vaccine."
29059,"I give them credit that they are the only ones of the big 3 to do weekly PCR tests on trial patients, but they have had enough hiccups that they likely won't gain approval for awhile."
29060,"There was also this Wired article (https://www.wired.com/story/does-the-astrazeneca-vaccine-also-stop-covid-transmission/) from last week that pointed out that when AZ created the vaccine, it was done so with reducing the severity of symptoms (to unburden the healthcare system)."
29061,"There are still questions whether someone who has had the AZ vaccine and is exposed can become an asymptomatic spreader - their immune system will prevent them from getting bad symptoms, but that means they also won't know that they are potentially infectious."
29062,"The vaccine will help the individual from getting severely sick, but it may do nothing to reduce spread to the uninnoculated."

29064,No.

29206,Perhaps not.
29207,It may be that vaccinating those most likely to contract it will lead to fewer deaths.
29208,The most effective vaccine right now will be the one that is available unfortunately.
29209,The way the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines work (a bit of a novel approach related to mRNA) is that it takes a critical fragment of the RNA (genetic material or proteins) from the SARS-COV-2 virus and codes it into the vaccine.
29210,What that does is give the immune system a “taste” of what the virus looks like and how it would act in the body if you were infected with any virus that had that viral fragment as part of its genetic code.
29211,The unique thing with mRNA vaccines is that your body makes the proteins to fight the virus themselves after receiving the “blueprint” from the vaccine.
29212,"So to answer your question, it’s extremely unlikely that the virus could mutate even if you’re vaccinated and then infected with it because that’s just not quite how this particular virus works in the body."
29213,The fragment chosen for the virus is one that your body will recognize and produce significant amounts of proteins against and thus the virus would simply never survive long enough to even make you ill let alone mutate.
29214,I grew up in an area which had few childcare providers at the time.
29215,Their rates were so high only those who had relatively high salaries could afford them.
29216,The elders of the community taking care of children became the norm.
29217,Grandparents providing childcare was common.
29218,They encouraged us to play with the other children nearby and shared their love and stories with all the neighborhood kids.
29219,We didn't miss out on anything.
29220,When I was older I was grateful I experienced being cared for by our community of elders and grandparents.
29221,We had so much fun and they cultivated lifelong friendships and extended families.
29222,We also provided help and companionship to those providing our care.
29223,I wish this would become more common again.
29224,It would help those with low incomes.
29225,The children would be socialized and have experience interacting with people from all ages and backgrounds.
29226,Many others wouldn't have to face the choice of working or staying home and losing income.
29227,and yet people refuse to take it because they believe the leader created it thus it is fauty.
29228,Stop hating.
29229,[removed]
29230,Still amazing that those getting the vaccine in the UK today will have some sort of immunity by next Friday.
29231,That's a huge deal for frontline medical staff and those working in long term care facilities.
29232,"No, it takes a second dose 3 weeks after the first and then a week after the 2nd dose to achieve good immunity, plus you might still be able to infect people, we don't know if the vaccines provide sterilizing immunity"
29233,"Ah, I was wrong."
29234,I was looking at an article from august about trump still hyping up HCQ and referencing purchases already made.
29235,I don’t pretend to be an expert on viruses but the top virus experts were not suggesting we stock up on HCQ.
29236,"It remains a vanity project whose money could have gone to more worthwhile endeavors, including vaccine doses."
29237,"Especially since the trump admin ignored all mask and social distancing guidelines in favor of talking about vaccines, it seems foolish in the extreme that they whiffed on the one thing they were actually in favor of."

29246,"What she actually said ""The effect of the vaccine in increased risk, providing some kind of immune barrier, is still far off."""
29247,"In other words, vaccines will eventually provide an immune barrier - once people can actually take them."
29248,"What the headline says: ""Vaccines suck."""
29249,People seriously think we’ll be masking after a vaccine is out to the general public?
29250,Hilarious.
29251,"&gt;I mean, once the majority of nursing home residents and then everyone over 70 is vaccinated/has the option the outsized need to focus on it effectively ends because hospitalizations and deaths fall off a cliff."
29252,The people who are at the highest risk are in danger precisely because their immune systems aren’t very good.
29253,Which means that the vaccines aren’t going to be as effective for them and a large degree of their protection is going to depend on the people around them getting the vaccine.
29254,lol
29255,Who cares?
29256,The point is we got the ventilators and they saved lives
29257,My parents (early 70s) live in Tennessee.
29258,There's a state lawmaker there who has proposed passing a law now that *will not require you to get the COVID vaccine if you don't want too*.

29260,A vaccine isn't a drug.
29261,Only four interactions for vaccines have been identified...
29262,Ever.
29263,Three with the flu jab and one with the BCG.
29264,We spent 2 billion on vaccines.

29295,I am not willing to draw any conclusions yet that the Oxford/AstraZeneca is worse than Pfizer/Moderna.
29296,Sure they had a higher infection rate in the vaccinated group but they also were randomly testing subjects whereas Moderna/Pfizer only tested those with symptoms.
29297,I'd be interested to look at the data and see how many were asymptomatic infections in which case that could explain some of the gap.
29298,It sounded like none of them had any serious infections which is really the bigger picture.
29299,Count me in.

29304,It might be the most effective vaccine.
29305,The oxford protocol in the UK required testing every participant once a week.
29306,They went hunting for asymptomatic cases vs pfizer/moderna which only tested people that were symptomatic.
29307,From two weeks ago when they made their press release.
29308,"[https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19/comments/jzi6py/oxfordaz\_vaccine\_efficacy\_data/gdctu2o/?utm\_source=reddit&amp;utm\_medium=web2x&amp;context=3](https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19/comments/jzi6py/oxfordaz_vaccine_efficacy_data/gdctu2o/?utm_source=reddit&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3)

We will know more when we can see the peer reviewed data."
29309,"And is I'm so pathetic, who's so pathetic to bother replying to me?"
29310,It would be completely unexpected if either is not approved.
29311,"It’s not approved for children yet because it hasn’t been tested in them, but that approval is likely in the works."
29312,"Children aren’t at a super high priority for vaccination because they have a lower risk of serious disease, but it will happen eventually."
29313,You’re not wrong.

29320,"I can see this being followed, especially at first when only a small amount of the population is vaccinated."
29321,But as we get further into the summer and we’re vaccinating a majority of the less vulnerable population I think there will be a lot of pushback if they expect people to keep wearing masks and social distancing.
29322,"I personally plan on seeing my friends indoors and returning to restaurants, other indoor places etc once we’re all vaccinated."
29323,If that’s ~wrong~ then so be it.
29324,At the end of December.
29325,Which would mean first vaccinations Jan at the earliest.
29326,Keep in mind that there is a 50/50 chance your just going to get a Placebo too.
29327,So even if that vaccine ends up being the best you may still need to get vaccinated outside of the trial.
29328,I don't know for sure but I'd imagine with something like this when the trial is over they would tell you if you were part of the placebo group or not.
29329,"I don't disagree with that, but there are some ongoing negotiations that'll probably stretch into the next administration wherein some additional deliveries might be made."
29330,"Once J&amp;J is approved though, my understanding is there'll be more than enough -- if not, Pfizer and Moderna expected doses gets us fully through Phase 1 by Spring."
29331,Definitely hopeful the U.S. trial of AstraZenica plays out better than UK/Brazil.
29332,THAT'S your takeaway from this?
29333,?
29334,"I would argue that it’s almost impossible to list every single side effect that’s *not* going to happen, as based off of the trials that would be almost all major side effects."
29335,It’s likely easier to address specific concerns.
29336,There’s no way I’ll keep wearing this mask after getting vaccinated.
29337,No way.
29338,Should I wear a condom with my wife after I had a vasectomy?
29339,"You suggested that black people should ""act more white"" earlier."
29340,"Now you're saying that black people need to ""conform to the norms of society"" or they deserve ""ill treatment""."
29341,I don't have to try to put you in a box at all.
29342,You're doing that all by yourself.
29343,Because the US has 5% of the world's population but 25% of its corona deaths
29344,"10 people at a family get together is likely on the extreme low end for most people, unless the sample group is SF transplants who moved thousands of miles away from their families."
29345,That’s what Trump was basically saying ffs.
29346,🤦‍♂️
29347,"Well, in the face of evidence we could conclude this might only be the start."
29348,"I think what she is saying that vaccines are great, but they don't do anything until they're actually deployed — which is some way off in sufficient numbers, so that a ""third wave"" is very much a possibility until then."
29349,"For that reason, public health measures need to continue."
29350,"However, the (hopefully selective) quotation makes it sounds like the WHO is arguing for effectively permanent social distancing, even once populations have widespread immunity."
29351,"Frankly, that's not going to be sustainable."
29352,"After Boris Johnson, she's used to dealing with pricks."
29353,"Studios should have retrofitted just like any other business with advanced air filtration, universal masking, etc."
29354,There's also really no reason they need to work from the studio.

29467,*
29468,It is rare but there have been many reported cases of secondary covid infections.
29469,Since when has government shopped around for the best deal?
29470,"It’s not negligence when half the country is advocating for it, including most top White House officials."
29471,How can you possibly advocate for charges on something like this?
29472,It makes no sense.
29473,"They fucked up and shouldn’t have done it, but I’m not blaming them when everything they did was beyond legal."
29474,Awhile back I read a historical account of 1918 Flu and the details mirror our current situation (including the downplaying and lies).
29475,At the end of the Flu most people did not speak of the event due to the pain and in some cases the actions they took during the outbreak.
29476,Grief and or shame touched everyone.
29477,Few memorials where made to highlight the event.
29478,I don't think many people can comprehend the scale or rate of death of 1918.
29479,"It is at least an order of magnitude worse than this current situation

It was a mostly avoided topic due to the issues that came up when the topic was discussed."
29480,I think history will repeat itself and this will be a topic that gets avoided for the feelings and fights it immediately brings up.
29481,Yes it actually is.
29482,"People that keep ignoring the rules are the ones that are spreading this virus so much,"
29483,"Out of a random group of 40,000 people, some of them will develop Bell's Palsy whether they took a vaccine or not."
29484,So the numbers were small enough that this was not considered to be because of the vaccine.
29485,The EU isn't going to meet to approve the Pfizer vaccine until December 29th.
29486,Were I domiciled in the Motherland I'd probably fall under the 'probably yes' category.
29487,Were I one of the 86% that live outside of Moscow and Petersburg if all went well I would likely find myself in the 'definitely yes' category.
29488,"The vaccine supply is going to move sloooooowly out to the rest of the country, and there would be lots of time to wait and see."
29489,No choice but to wait and see actually.
29490,So is your point that nurses now have to hibernate like you?
29491,"That was me, guess I'm famous!"
29492,Who gives a shit whether you're impressed or not?
29493,"The vaccine that Biontech developed will be produced by Biontech in Germany, Pfizer in the US and Belgium and Fuson in China."

29498,"If true, this means they are stealing from us."

29501,"Will the FDA still be meeting on Thursday, December 10?"
29502,"Yeah, this part of it is extremely sketchy."

29507,"It's not quite as far along in the process yet, it will get there."
29508,"Geneva (Reuters) - Global demand for COVID-19 testing devices is expected to outstrip supply for a long time, Roche Chief Executive Severin Schwan said on Tuesday."
29509,"“We still have little information about duration and efficacy of vaccines (...) So diagnostics will remain very important, not only for the months to come but the years to come,” Schwan said in a briefing of the International Federation of Pharmaceutical Manufacturers &amp; Associations (IFPMA)."
29510,Read the original article and check if it says patient.
29511,Do you get the flu vaccine?
29512,I suspect not.
29513,And how is the government taking your freedom regarding the flu vaccine?
29514,And how are you demanding them back?
29515,Doesn't smell right.

29522,"It's easy to say people shouldn't go out when you can work at home doing some worthless job on the computer, you forget about all the postal workers and others that can't work from home our small businesses that will go out and families and employees starve and go homeless."
29523,"Not to mention we never would've had the virus in rural areas if people from major cities weren't passing through all the time, I'm pretty it's not the fault of the small town guy who has never left his state the virus is there, why should he have to pay the consequences because of someone else, someone much better off than him."
29524,putin 69D galaxy brain
29525,My wife is a nurse and this was essentially the discussion we had after her first potential exposure.
29526,"When we first learned of it, we were considering either an RV or a hotel room near the hospital."
29527,"Then we learned the possible exposure actually happened days prior, meaning she would’ve already brought it home by that point (patient neglected to mention they were awaiting test results when they were admitted)."
29528,"Eventually yes, the aim with this priority is to go first for the people who are WAY more likely to straight out die if they get it (the elderly) and the people you need to be healthy in order to deal with anyone having it (the front line medical staff)."
29529,The numbers say that will cut down the death rate fastest with the least number of doses early on.
29530,Let's all take a moment and remember that 28 days later began in the UK lol
29531,I did this in the beginning of the pandemic.
29532,"Two roommates, all living separate lives."
29533,"All of us were taking precautions, but there was no real reason to risk it."
29534,No confirmed cases.
29535,"If takeout/surface transmission was a measurable source of transmission, we'd know this by now."
29536,Takeout is very safe.
29537,"Wear a mask any time you come in contact with someone else (including the drive-through), wash your hands before and after."
29538,"For an added layer of security (though it's not necessary), transfer your meals to your own plates and throw away the wrappings."
29539,So that's how you get a Russian to sober up!!
29540,Brillant
29541,So why don't we vaccinate twice as many people with just 1 dose each?
29542,Than maybe come back with boosters as needed when supply catches up?
29543,[removed]
29544,The planet is round and vaccine your child.
29545,"If they had already payed for it ages ago, Is the only reason I can think of."
29546,"Enjoy your flight

Lol"
29547,"Sort of, we don't have enough data in between 1 and 2 doses to say much with confidence other than it looks like it works to some degree but it may not last long and may not protect all age groups the same."
29548,At this time it's best to still plan on getting both.
29549,At my work when we're on VPN we all share the same public facing IP.
29550,"The police could be being intentionally misleading by saying the IP is associated with her, because a shared work VPN IP could be associated with her and anyone else who has used the same VPN."
29551,It could potentially be associated to anyone or everyone at her work depending on how their networks are set up.
29552,No I'm not
29553,"Yeah no one is going to fire pregnant people for following doctors advice, that's a straw-man."
29554,&gt;But responsible reporting requires they be put in proper context.
29555,"This article provides no context to what they died of, implies but doesn't outright state that they were in the vaccine group, 


Did you not read the article, it says this:

&gt;""According to the published data, six of the participants in the experiment died, two of whom received the vaccine and four of the control group,” said Dr. Uri Lerner, the scientific director for Midaat."
29556,"“After an in-depth examination, no connection was found between the experiment and the cause of death.”

Sums up pretty well..."
29557,I'm talking about the planet's needs collectively in response to the quote
29558,"woah, edgy take!"
29559,Okay I get it.
29560,"So it's basically what I said, you thought that if you're in the placebo group, they'll give the vaccine to you automatically upon EUA."
29561,"Well honestly, I would have thought it was clear placebo group folks were taking a risk and would have to wait, but this looks like something you'll have to bring up with them."
29562,It should get better even without vaccines because of the weather and people staying outside.
29563,"But yeah, it will probably take until the end of 2021 for everyone to be vaccinated and festivals and kissing contests to be allowed again."
29564,That’s why I asked.
29565,If they live in the same house then it’s no issue.
29566,But if they are having family over and exceed the 10 people limit then its an issue
29567,/r/longhaulers
29568,I don't want to sue anyone.
29569,I want to get vaccinated.
29570,This is an oversimplification.
29571,Some of the vaccines require much much colder temperatures.
29572,Very few hospitals or facilities around the country have large freezers cold enough for the Pfizer vaccine (-94F).
29573,This is the one that seems most likely and ready to be distributed first but it has this technical challenge that it just can't be stored in many places.
29574,"The next issue is, how do you get millions of people close enough to the cold storage to take the vaccine."
29575,"If you set up a tent in a parking lot and let people drive through, now you need a super refrigerated truck to move the vaccine from one of the few super cold freezers to the parking lot."
29576,"You have to power that truck while it sits in that lot distributing vaccines, etc."
29577,etc.
29578,This process must scale or else there is no way to distribute to millions and millions of people.
29579,"The alternative is, send millions of people to these industrial freezers / hospitals which also has its challenges."
29580,To say that there is no challenge here and that hospitals are ready for vaccine distribution is a vast oversimplification.
29581,He's been waiting a long time.
29582,"Your auto insurance can drop you if you get into too many accidents, your health insurance should be able to drop you because you won't get a vaccine."
29583,"Most health insurance plans already charge more if you are a smoker, how is this different?"
29584,You are choosing to do something adverse to your health.
29585,"This long term side effects thing seems to be a very popular refrain of ""Long Covid"" but never really in a scientific manner."
29586,All the pre-review on this I have seen are for people who were hospitalized and on ventilators.
29587,"There is also ""long covid"" for people who had mild to medium symptoms but the pattern for this does not match scientific observations of Covid."
29588,"Long haulers are almost all female, average age of 44, physically fit prior to symptoms, only 25% actually had a positive Covid test, they are very active on social support groups, and many of them have started their own ""research."""
29589,Hardly a scientific sample and there is lots of evidence that symptoms of other ailments are being attributed to Covid by these so called long haulers because there is a huge spotlight placed on Covid.
29590,"The life long side effects has fallen into the same ""can't prove a negative"" category that can be applied to long term risk of the vaccine, damage to mental health, frayed family ties, lost livelihoods, long term wage potential, etc..."
29591,"It is important to stay away from the ""proving a negative"" perspective and stick to the facts, so I will not be spending time with my 86 year old father during the holidays because that is dangerous to him, but will take the risk of socializing with my neighbors during the holidays with some precautions."

29602,Biontech has also a plant in Germany that is producing the vaccine and there is also production in China by Fuson.
29603,"No, we're still contracted for 100 million doses and OWS (to meet with Biden) is already working with Pfizer to ramp up production to meet additional demand."

29617,Meaning if this were true the virus would also cause infertility?
29618,Said nobody.
29619,It's the least they should be doing.
29620,"I'm not impressed by that, nor should anybody else in America in this cluster of Operation Warp Speed."
29621,It's like going to McDonalds and being amazed that they have hamburgers you can buy.
29622,IIRC China and Indonesia cooperated because Indonesia need vaccine that it cannot develop (terrible capability of advanced research here) while China need to use places with active pandemic like Indonesia (and I think Brazil too) as testing place as China had managed to curb it (relatively speaking)

29791,You will see that it is really the CDC and it is not fake.
29792,It’s all bad
29793,People die by the thousands every day while much of the world waits for this specific vaccine.
29794,"Calling to casually wait months more just to confirm which dosage is peak efficiency when it's safe at either dosage, and would save many lives at either dosage, is just repugnant and shows a lack of understanding of the bigger picture."
29795,[Increased viral load is correlated with increased disease severity](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-020-19057-5).
29796,"The evidence of this is overwhelming, and strongly implies that the reduction in symptomatic and severe disease we've seen in all vaccines will lead to an equal or larger reduction in spread."
29797,"Again, you said “no data” which is false."
29798,"By July, it was clear there were four promising candidates in the running."
29799,"This is all about risk management, the smart thing to do was buy more than you need, assuming only one vaccine works, spread out over top four or five candidates,  especially if the agreement is non-binding."
29800,Good lord vodka cheaper than water
29801,"I'm happy for us too, but there are still millions of fucking morons who won't take it"
29802,I’m hoping that private business can play an important role here.
29803,"“All employees must show proof of vaccination to enter the building/stay on the company healthcare plan/be allowed to interact with customers” etc etc

At my supermarket now every checker wears a print out badge saying that they passed their covid test earlier in that day."
29804,"You know businesses will leverage “your safety is important, our employees are required to be vaccinated”’as a competitive advantage over rivals."
29805,Anyone who doesn’t do this is bad at business.
29806,"While I expect my wife and I should be able to be vaccinated by April, and if you are an adult I would agree that's pessimistic."
29807,However I am not as confident they will have widespread vaccination available for children under 12 by then.
29808,Just due to length of time to test and confirm safety.
29809,One thing that is specific to the FDA is that they have their own statisticians.
29810,"The company has to send FDA the raw data, and they will confirm the results."
29811,Most other countries review the company's summary reports but don't do their own analyses.
29812,"Yeah, or at least rapidly heading in that direction."
29813,"I'm just stunned that so many mega-low-risk people who for months insisted that they were selfless saints - ""they weren't worried about themselves, just infecting vulnerable people"" - have so quickly admitted that actually, it was about them and things need to be shut down until they can get the vaccine."
29814,WILD.
29815,"Yes, we can."
29816,"And we do lol

Welcome to the party?"
29817,"Yeah, only 600 million doses"
29818,The reported r value will drop simply because millions of people who have it won't get tested.
29819,Which will open things up.

29829,"Once the doctor gives me the all clear, goodbye masks, goodbye social distancing."
29830,You're definitely right because nobody was wearing a mask back in may when cases were really low where I was.
29831,Thanks.
29832,I was too lazy to do the math for the record.
29833,Thumbs up.
29834,Same.
29835,"People keep trying to use the ""could still infect people"" narrative as some kind of gotcha, but what's the damn difference if you get the virus, and it doesn't do anything at all to you?"
29836,Just means people better take the vaccine.
29837,Interesting af actually

29841,Where are you getting the 60% figure?
29842,Because it's not accurate.
29843,If you gave me a choice I would take the AZ/Oxford vaccine over mRNA.
29844,"I’ll let other people be the guinea pigs for long term side effects, and a vaccine that helps you enough to prevent hospitalization is enough for me."
29845,Agreed 100%
29846,So are you contagious for this long?
29847,Batman got one two.
29848,He was early.
29849,The vaccine hasn't been proven to protect you from infection.
29850,"You can still get it an pass it on, it just makes the symptoms less severe."
29851,"If you're not vaccinated in a group of vaccinated people, you're not causing any harm."
29852,I've been sick and struggling to meet my BMR caloric requirements and plain kettle chips are one of the foods I make sure to have around because it's an easy way to bulk out that calorie count.

29855,Gotcha.

29859,"I don’t know the specifics, but it appears we are only behind the UK by a few days."
29860,&gt;Maybe this is a dumb question - but why doesn't the US government use the Defense Production Act and force drug companies to start making the vaccine??
29861,"(I know why THIS administration hasn't done it, but why hasn't Biden talked about it?"
29862,Or have I just missed that?)
29863,Because manufacturing is hard.
29864,Even if you seized the factories and forced them to produce it supply will remain highly constrained for the next few months.

29869,"They aren’t doing anything medically irresponsible though, they are in the range of what is considered acceptable behavior."
29870,My father is a doctor who works with COVID patients and doing COVID testing.
29871,"I live with him, my mom, and my brother."
29872,"At the beginning of the pandemic he social distanced from us, although we didn’t wear masks inside."
29873,At this point he feels like he is very protected by his PPE and feels safe being around us.
29874,"My parents also grocery shop, we order things online, and we get takeout."
29875,None of this is risk free.
29876,There is no way to live a risk free life.
29877,It’s impossible.
29878,"Taking small, reasonable risks that don’t actually violate medical consensus isn’t irresponsible and can be the best, most logical decision."
29879,"Also people’s emotions and mental health do matter, and are a reasonable part of the equation."
29880,Yes.
29881,This.
29882,I never said otherwise.
29883,What are you replying to?
29884,There's also a strong correlation between the elderly and conservative political views.
29885,"So despite them being the high risk demographic, there's a good chance they're also be the demographic that wouldn't willingly vaccinate."
29886,Conservatives don't.
29887,THAT'S the problem.
29888,Looked it up on google and you might have error 404
29889,Not in this case.
29890,"That data is separate and easy to find the rate of divorce in first marriages, 2nd, 3rd, etc..."

29909,Same to you!
29910,"Yes I'm sure Dr Fauci, who's predicting widespread distribution by April, hasn't considered ... er ... logistics?"
29911,"This would also mean, we theoretically have twice the doses already!"
29912,"In fact it may be beneficial to only get one dose, then."
29913,"If this holds true, it would be a complete game changer."
29914,I don't give two thirds of a fuck about bars or sporting venues.
29915,I somewhat care about restaurants.
29916,"I want to be able to feel safe sending my child to school and feel safe going to the store, pharmacy, etc."
29917,"Different strokes for different folks but bars, restaurants and sporting venues wouldn't be blip in many of the lives of the people I know."
29918,Me too.
29919,It might sound silly but I’ve collected a bunch of cool masks and I feel like it would be a shame if I never got to wear them again once everyone is vaccinated.

29944,Yeah exactly what I was thinking.
29945,So say we all.
29946,I...don't think that's true.
29947,Couple of things.
29948,First we don’t need to vaccinate children and teenagers.
29949,That’s about 70 million people you can knock out right off the bat.
29950,Second the timetable is murky at this point but April for general public’s first dose then a really robust rollout where the majority of the general public are getting their second dose in June seems plausible.

29956,I'm still optimistic we might see employers give employees deadlines to either get vaccinated or lose their job unless they've got a medical exception.
29957,"Without that, I don't think we'll see enough participation to gain heard immunity."
29958,"We need about 75%, we're seeing about 50% willing to take it."
29959,"Of course ""willing"" doesn't equal doing, so 40% getting vaccinated will help but not end the pandemic."
29960,Hopefully we'll start seeing that in the fall.
29961,We can't afford to not do so.
29962,Too many people are getting too sick for too long.
29963,It's unsustainable for our economy to carry so much dead weight.
29964,I'll get it as soon as I'm eligible.
29965,Antivaxers have no chance on convincing me otherwise.
29966,It’s more likely that “no choice” will be  case for the majority in the short term.
29967,Even in the U.K. the logistics for the Pfizer jab means that they cannot vaccinate in care homes right now.
29968,"The AZ/Oxford vaccine is still going to stop this virus and, as mentioned already in this thread, nobody that received any of these vaccines needed hospital treatment."
29969,This is what I would like to know.
29970,"It sounds like the answer may be ""longevity"" but that really muddys the water on vaccine distribution doesnt it"

29972,Who cares.
29973,It’s a one time sunk cost for this upcoming season only that he’ll just use for a tax write-off.

29976,We shouldn’t be feeling bad for him at all.
29977,"So, I have a question here."
29978,"My understanding is these vaccines aren't effective for awhile after you get them (for most of them, it requires a second dose), so conceivably you could still contract Covid even after getting the shot if say, you were in a huge line for like an hour in CVS waiting to get it with a bunch of people who have Covid and didn't even realize they were sick (or maybe they were, but decided to go and get a shot anyways), right?"
29979,"Could this kind of thing potentially be a super spreader event waiting to happen, or am I misunderstanding how the vaccine works?"
29980,"I just want to get the vaccine as soon as possible, but I don't want to get Covid while standing in line to get it, lol."
29981,Don’t forget the yelling.

29993,"Sometimes that's true, but it's a gross generalization for small time landlords."
29994,"There are plenty of landlords who were forced into it when they can't sell the property due to divorce, economic downturn, not being able to pay for two mortgages long enough to sell, etc."
29995,I also know quite a few people who rent out a MIL or rooms in their house because that's the only way they can afford to live off minimum wage.
29996,"There are also plenty of landlords who chose to not raise rent on existing tenants, who are now screwed because they don't have as big a cash reserve."

30144,&gt; Why is the US approval taking so much longer than other nations?
30145,The US approval process is the gold standard.
30146,"In fact, many nations will approve a drug almost solely based on the fact that it met US approval."
30147,Most other western nations are on roughly the same schedule.
30148,"Have to remember, these review processes are set up for normal times when a week or two doesn't really matter."
30149,As the some of the other nations with rapid approval... just look at the list of them and you will see your answer.
30150,"I mean, it's at I think 61% in the US now?"
30151,"And that'll get higher, since it seems deeply unlikely that there aren't at least a decent number of that 39% that will come around once they see more evidence of safety."
30152,And people in my state are screaming that Pritzker is being mean to them.
30153,People dont care and the counties are having to shut down businesses that are ignoring rules.

30157,The mask mandates will still be in place.
30158,The whole world doesn’t revolve around you and everyone with that same entitled attitude.
30159,We get through this together.
30160,People like you are threatening to sabotage the common good.
30161,Anybody know of any websites tracking the amount of people that have become vaccinated?
30162,That is a good point.
30163,How are they going to police this?
30164,"I mean, everyone needs to get it eventually, but if we don't vaccinate the most at risk people first, it's just going to cause a bigger problem... sigh."
30165,"The concern now is a couple days ago Warner said they are releasing Dune, along with ALL other 2021 releases, in theaters and streaming simultaneously."

30175,"As someone also on Chemo, I want to say dont give up."
30176,In all respects.
30177,I agree that seeing friends might be a reasonable risk balance for you.
30178,"For example, people who need narcotics and alcoholics anonymous meetings to stay clean should not avoid them despite this risks."
30179,Their relative risk is much higher relapsing from avoiding meetings than from covid.
30180,Same for you.
30181,"You are a a low point, which happens a lot to men in their 20s and 30s, but especially now."
30182,"See friends, but dont give up."
30183,Dont give up caring about covid either.

30187,America really has been fucking this up.

30189,I just did a =SUM of the column that has deaths listed
30190,"Yeah, I’ve been a bit worried this will happen."
30191,"I know a few people who did this with the Gardasil vaccine, and only got the first dose."
30192,But hopefully most people will get both doses in the correct time frame since covid is scarier than HPV!
30193,"Whoa, I know there are small hospitals, but they only have a single physician and one PA."
30194,"I looked it up and they are 16 acute beds, 20 long term care, it doesn't look like any surgery (?)."
30195,I forget that hospitals get that small.
30196,"Last I checked, idiots voluntarily provide their information to Facebook."
30197,Which is different than the government demanding it be handed over.
30198,Hopefully you get tethering at no additional cost
30199,Really?
30200,They're going to require a doctor's note to say your heart is bad before you get a vaccine?
30201,I doubt it.
30202,It's a vaccine.
30203,It's going to be like the flu vaccine.
30204,It’s just a tiny microchip coward

30218,Doesn’t Russia and China claim to have vaccines that they are administering?
30219,Or at least be reimbursed for their costs.
30220,"Nobody should be profiting off this, IMO."
30221,CVS will come out smelling like a rose if they do this for no profit.
30222,"Hell, smell like perfume if they figure out a way to vaccinate lower income communities for no charge!"
30223,"*Every nations agency protocols are there for a reason*

So humans are different in the UK?"
30224,Should the US consulate warn US citizens not to get vaccinated in the UK then?
30225,"How could it possibly be safe to inject the vaccine in the UK, but not in the US?"

30238,Thankfully we have people who brave enough to do this when called upon.
30239,As it should be.
30240,If you're under 50 covid isn't much of a risk to you.
30241,They had several months to figure out how to transport vaccines to care homes knowing full well the requirements to store the vaccine.
30242,Why are they just now trying to figure this out?
30243,Would it offend you if vaccination cut transmission by a large amount?
30244,These articles reek of fearmongering and ignore that if it protects people from getting sick then it means the virus won't be reproducing as much in the body most likely.
30245,Ok. Sure.

30255,"Day 9, for those who struggle with the exponential concept."

30257,Like wtf.
30258,Covid had great success in both North and South Dakota.
30259,It touched a lot of lives.
30260,I read an article in the WSJ outlining public safety concerns over the virus - it appears a solid percentage of citizens spread around the EU are opting to delay inoculation until results are more solidified (in the sense of efficacy but also potential side effects).
30261,I’m assuming that those percentages in the EU will be somewhat mirrored in the US with people holding similar concerns.
30262,"We currently talk about best case scenarios in which less than stringent public safety measures will be widespread before next summer, with a return to a relatively ‘normal’ lifestyle sometime during or after that period of time."
30263,But I can’t help but think that timeline may be extended.
30264,Anyone care to share their insight?

30278,"As far as I know, we typically only send adults up there"
30279,the smart thing would be to live in an off-premises residence and set up outdoor mobile trailer offices (like construction sites) so that staff aren't breathing the same recirculated air.
30280,"man jokes on me, im moving to africa in january"
30281,Wouldn't it be cool if they designed an infectious VACCINE?!

30283,"Also, he should be arrested for all the sexual assaults he pays out in civil court"

30290,"No, I meant that the group that was supposed to prove 90%+ efficiency was all under 55 years old and split in two countries, thus invalid."
30291,Only the 62% was valid.
30292,"sure but unless they're near the front of the line to get jabbed, plenty of the people they're carelessly spreading it to are themselves going to vaccinated."
30293,"On top of that, almost anyone who at that point isn't vaccinated will be in a low risk group."
30294,"We live in a dense neighborhood, and especially toward the beginning of lockdown you could hear drunk couples screaming at each other from their apts almost every night."
30295,My wife and I are 11 months sober and (other than rent/bills fucking us) we’re happier than ever.
30296,"I mean I guess we still smoke weed, so not sober."
30297,TL;DR: Just get high I guess?
30298,Didn't they already give one to their military personnel?
30299,Plus they must have the production capacity to churn out enough for everyone in only a few months.
30300,Imagine dying mere weeks before the vaccine just because you couldn't spend one Christmas alone.
30301,&gt; A California nurse urged doctors to clearly explain the possible side effects of Pfizer's COVID-19 vaccine to patients after experiencing intense symptoms in the company's phase three clinical trial.
30302,"To be fair, doctors have been pretty upfront about side effects."
30303,Even the flu vaccine has some side effects.
30304,I’ve seen quite a few articles where doctors have been clear you might feel like shit for 24-48 hours after vaccination.
30305,This is just referring to what the US will have available.
30306,Yes it should if it’s working.
30307,Fuck Wapo's paywalls
30308,BTW fda finished their review looks like it will be approved soon
30309,you mistake being tough about a problem to that problem being disproportionately high.
30310,this is the same fallacy that leads to ridiculous conclusions like COVID-19 being 100% from China or HIV being 100% from the US simply because that's where they were first discovered.

A third wave of Covid-19 is in the background of the evolution of the curves, according to the Hospital Federation of France, which asks the executive to be ""extremely vigilant"" in terms of easing confinement."
30319,"The French Hospital Federation calls for *""extreme vigilance""* with regard to the **measures to relax confinement** which could be implemented from December 15."
30320,"According to her, there is a *""strong alert on the risks of the third wave""* of Covid-19."
30321,"This third wave is neither *""virtual""* , she says, nor a *""distant perspective""*  but *""well in the background of the evolution of curves"",* explained the president of the FHF, Frédéric Valletoux, during of a press conference."
30322,"After peaking at more than 50,000 or even 60,000 new positive tests at the end of October in France, the pace slowed down to reach 10,000 to 11,000 daily cases at the end of November."
30323,"But since then, **the number of new cases has leveled off** at around 10,000 cases per day, according to the French public health agency."
30324,"*""The level of hospitalization decreases very little, in any case very far from the rate that we had known after the first confinement"",* also indicates Frédéric Valletoux."

They *were* racist at the time."
30330,"The targeting of the travel bans did not make sense for controlling the virus, but plenty of sense for fueling xenophobic narratives that served conservative political points."
30331,It's like this.
30332,"Covid can be passed in crowded public transportation, right?"
30333,So imagine the politicians make a law that no black people can ride public transportation.
30334,"Yes, it would slow the virus a little (because fewer people would be using buses), but it's also fantastically racist and doesn't prevent non-black people from continuing to spread..."
30335,"The main transparent reason for such a ban would be racism, not good public health."
30336,Many of the strains that took hold here in the U.S. came out of Europe.
30337,"The early china travel bans were not just racist, but also inefficient and stupid, and were labeled as such at the time by many people on the left, but all conservatives can remember is 'We tried to do something and meanies called us racist!'"
30338,"So again - if you were the Secretary of State, would you instruct the US Embassy in London to warn all US citizens in the UK to **NOT** get the vaccine until its approved by the FDA?"
30339,"Your situation is dramatically different from the story you replied to, which involved someone's boss (so someone who still has a job and is presumably paid well) and living with an extremely at-risk individual whose life they're forcibly endangering."
30340,"You're not really explaining ""why people are doing this,"" just why *you're* doing this, and your explanation is way more reasonable than the guy who might kill his dad because he did this."
30341,this is irresponsible
30342,I think they have reasons to be skeptical.
30343,"It would be a help if black celebs like Beyonce, Jay-Z, the Obamas, etc."
30344,got the vaccine publicly.
30345,&gt; but getting them in Q3 2021 makes them worthless compared to a million doses we can get in Q2.

30358,Anecdotal but a guy on the podcast i listen to got it in early September.
30359,He's in his 20s and otherwise healthy but he had to be hospitalized.
30360,Says he still has brain fog fairly regularly and is only just now having a follow up appointment to see if he can get off blood thinners which he's been on since being hospitalized.
30361,Even though most of us will be unaffected or only slightly affected its still a figurative roll of the dice when you get it.
30362,Reading this makes me wish our local hospitals didn't lay off thousands of nursing staff back in April when people were afraid to go to hospitals and they were ghosts towns.
30363,I hope not.
30364,If we assume 50% of the country needs to be infected (scientists seem to think it's more like 70-90) we need 150 million more cases this winter.
30365,So...well over 1 million new cases per day for the next 4 months.
30366,I don't think anyone really knows what that would look like...but it's not good.

30380,3 people recently died from it
30381,&gt; 1 Billion doses committed + options for 1.4 Billion more ... it might be enough.
30382,Would've been nice to have them now tbh.
30383,"Hang in there, doc."
30384,Just forty more days...
30385,"Well at least they accelerated trials by spreading disease rampantly, including among the vulnerable."
30386,"My local CVS hasn't really done anything to adapt to COVID, from what I can tell."
30387,Like the pharmacy is way more busy than usual for some reason and the line for it routinely stretches down a very busy aisle.
30388,So people in line are trying to distance but at the same time people are walking down he aisle looking for stuff.
30389,I'd love for them to just clear out the items in that aisle.
30390,There's a lot of stuff no one ever really comes looking for...just move the stock around.
30391,I know it's a big ask.
30392,"Man, this sub is filled with doom and gloom, Let us laugh at the funny name and be happy he got a vaccine"
30393,The majority will be vaccinated by the fall.
30394,It's not going to take 9 months to just vaccinate the high risk groups.
30395,That makes sense.
30396,"If we have a limited supply, doctors and the vulnerable come first."
30397,"Yeah, clearly a lot more work needs to be done."
30398,R/nottheonion
30399,"If the immunity kicks in 10 days after the first dose, what's the second dose needed for?"
30400,"If (close to) everyone is vaccinated, does it even matter if we're *technically* infecting each other?"
30401,Maybe it's because you haven't attached any actual consequences.
30402,"Like for being one of the ""better"" states in terms of response, NJ and Murphy have still been pretty wimpy about enforcement of things."
30403,"That's why back in August when my gf's family was urging her to come home for a bachelorette and she said no because we were on the travel advisory they all went ""well no one is actually CHECKING"""
30404,6 times as many microchips!!
30405,!

30408,About 22%?

30411,"That's really interesting, thanks for the info."
30412,"Yes, once data shows a consistent downward trend then there shouldn't be a problem lifting restrictions."
30413,Doing it just because the vaccine has become available isn't the same thing; we should actually be seeing the effects before declaring it all clear.

30419,*
30420,How is this new?
30421,Some countries already had required vaccinations against certain diseases to enter them even before COVID broke out.
30422,Yellow Fever in several African countries is one example.
30423,We had phase 1/2 clinical trial data that showed positive results.
30424,What set Pfizer/moderna/j&amp;j/AZ apart from the 200 others was that they can speed up and scale up.
30425,The agreement was non-binding.
30426,They dropped the ball bad.
30427,"I believe that if you took a random sample of the population to test, it could be as low as 50% accuracy."
30428,"But he had all the symptoms, including trouble breathing, plus the positive antibody test."
30429,"I know it's rare to get reinfected six months later, but I have to imagine it's got to be at least as unlikely to have those kinds of symptoms &amp; get a positive test, but for to not be covid"
30430,sometimes that just happens.
30431,every once in a while i'll find myself commenting in a thread where the first 5 to 10 commenters are just covid deniers or people taking insane risks and thinking it means they are immune.
30432,it's weird.
30433,[removed]
30434,"Karma, perhaps?"
30435,Maybe we shouldn't be rushing to kill as many as possible before Trump's term is over while their is a massive outbreak at that facility.
30436,'Most executions during one term' isn't really a record  most are overly proud of.
30437,"He already has 280,000 deaths on his hands - a few extra executions won't change those stats much"
30438,So is there any reason now to approve and manufacture this?
30439,"While Pfizer and Moderna are more expensive and Pfizer is a logistics nightmare, they are still not THAT expensive, are significantly more effective and are Pfizer is already being shipped out."
30440,If I were a country I would sign a production boosting deal with these two.
30441,Counterpoint: blueprints.
30442,Literally printed on paper and worth quite a lot.
30443,"Additional counterpoint: any successful project ever, do you even honestly work in the real world?"
30444,what a silly statement.
30445,A pandemic *plan* doesn't mean buying and stashing ventilators.
30446,"It means attempting to establish problems and goals before hand, so they don't have to be figured out on the fly."
30447,"You described a **bad** pandemic plan, that doesn't mean all plans are bad and expensive."
30448,"A plan might establish estimates for current ventilator numbers, estimated needs based on growth patterns of diseases, and how they might be procured and distributed effectively."
30449,"Instead of buying ventilators and stashing them somewhere, we've simply established useful outlines to help guide the implementation of a system of procuring and delivering ventilators if needed at scale."
30450,"What's more, a plan might've meant that we needed fewer over a longer time."
30451,"A plan wouldn't have prevented this pandemic, but it might have helped."
30452,"Yeah, my understanding is that measles is 100% airborne and that Covid can live in tiny aerosols but can't survive on it's own."
30453,"So it can float in the air for a few hours and spread through ventilation systems, but not as well as measles."
30454,".Even if all UK residents are vaccinated, there will be flights originating from countries without the vaccine which have to be carefully scanned and monitored, which is why we will need to continue wearing facemasks for a long time."
30455,"Yeah, there are a LOT more people moving around than there are in this first rollout."
30456,Just the people that still need to go to work to basically keep the lights on &amp; food on our plates is more than this first availability (that's before you factor in idiots who don't think about others).
30457,That's why it's very targeted to try and save the most suffering to the most people.
30458,I heard a stat of something like a third of all deaths over the course of what we've had so far belonged to the group that are being targeted now (with the hope that it will cut roughly a third of possible future deaths by the extension of the demographic risk).
30459,Failure to prepare is preparation to fail.
30460,But how long will they last ?
30461,I thought people are only immune for a few months ?
30462,Ugh you're completely right.
30463,I never thought about that.
30464,"It's not a handout, it was your money that you paid in taxes."
30465,It would be just like the first check.
30466,"Either by mail or, if you have it set up, direct deposit."
30467,new subreddit: /r/cvscovidreceipts
30468,"I have a question: now that the efficacy of the vaccine is being confirmed, can Pfizer license the production?"
30469,The New Normal is good preparation for the next pandemic.
30470,"At the very least, it should permanently stay the norm to mask up in public transit, medical centers, pharmacies, general/grocery stores, and government offices-places that are completely essential."
30471,The majority of the population won’t be getting vaccines until the fall.
30472,"It’s just going to elderly, healthcare, and public service first."
30473,My spouse is a teacher.
30474,"Normally, at least one of us (household of four) has the sniffles whenever school is in session."
30475,"This year, the school has insisted on face to face learning, but with masks and distancing, and so far, no colds at all."
30476,Susan Collins said so!
30477,"Yeah, it looks like peak 7 day average daily new cases was 6,563 (reported)."
30478,"Absolute peak was 7,989 on Nov 18th (reported)."
30479,"Population of Wisconsin is listed as 5,822,434."
30480,So that would be 0.1127% of the population per day (as a 7d avg) at peak.
30481,Or 0.1372% of the population per day on Nov 18th.
30482,"https://www.census.gov/quickfacts/WI

https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/usa/wisconsin/"
30483,"&gt;  After that, it will only pop up in people's minds when they separately think about all sorts of various old events."
30484,It will be a meme forever is I think how this will play out.
30485,"Comedy movies will all contain a line about ""BRO STAY BACK WITH DAT RONA HAHA""

It'll replace ""cooties"" as the term to describe hypochondriacs."
30486,If it benefits the insurance companies to pressure employers you should expect every last insurance company to do so.
30487,"Whatever makes them more money is what they will all do, in fact it's what they *must* do, and no competitor is going to spring into existence with a policy that will cost their shareholders profits just to nice."
30488,Can any one explain how it is that the FDA reviews and confirms this stuff?
30489,They're just looking at the data provided by the companies?
30490,It's still 2 shots.
30491,"But the Moderna vaccine doesn't need the same refrigeration requirements, so it'll be easier to distribute"
30492,I was barely almost 2 when 9/11 happened.
30493,"I slightly remember being babysat by my grandparents watching the tv not knowing what was happening, for my mom to come home and keep hugging me, as she worked a flew blocks away from the WTC."
30494,One of my earliest memories.
30495,"Many of them were from New York, lol."
30496,There isn't one because the federal response to coronavirus has been a joke.
30497,Lack of data doesn't mean you can just pull numbers out of thin air though.
30498,I picked a bad time to stop shooting heroin
30499,"OK, great, we both lobby the mods to ban all posts on mask-wearing as they're all entirely evidence-free despite taking up a tediously large amount of space on here for weeks and months."
30500,"As I read it, that 70% is comparative detected cases of Covid, nobody had a serious case more than 21 days after the first shot according to the article."
30501,"&gt; “It’s really important to note that within 21 days of the first vaccination, nobody was admitted to hospital with Covid or had severe Covid and that’s just after one dose – that’s after any one dose in these trials – no admissions to hospital, and that’s a really major result for public health benefits.”"
30502,[removed]
30503,The article is racist.
30504,It implies that black and white couple are going to break up.
30505,The numbers a hard fir me also but I don’t think it’s a hoax either.
30506,"I think we have [a good indication of the long term effects](https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/coronavirus/in-depth/coronavirus-long-term-effects/art-20490351), but we probably don't know 1) what percentage of people who survive the virus end up with each of them, or 2) how long it takes for people who have them to fully recover (if ever.)"
30507,"HIV, gonnorhea, chlamydia, Hep C, syphilis, a much better flu vaccine, strep, MRSA....

Just to name a few."
30508,Exactly.
30509,And that is why a follow up is needed in three weeks.
30510,It took like five days for us to go from 14 to 15 million.
30511,"Remember when they told us to “flatten the curve?”

This is the nightmare scenario they were trying to avoid."
30512,"Wear your masks, stay home if you can, and get vaccinated when it’s available to you."
30513,The point of these early COVID vaccines is so the virus is generally stopped by vaccinated people's bodies before they infest badly enough to cause longterm effects or require that people get hospital care to live.
30514,damn so 2 people in a day?
30515,Kinda going at a snales pace..shouldn't they be doing 1000 a day at least?
30516,"I can totally see the amount of people holding off on getting the vaccine until after New Years so they can drink, and then finding out they almost all got infected and it is now too late."
30517,It’s actually 62-90% depending on the scheme.

30535,Perhaps all of the posts here about mask wearing ARE anecdotal.

30571,"They are only able to produce 1.3 billion doses next year, assuming nothing else goes wrong."

Let's say I get the vaccine."

30582,"Now let's say that two months later, it turns out that, once you've gotten the vaccine, you can't spread it to anyone."
30583,...so what do I get in compensation for those two months?
30584,"See, I can understand where you want to weigh the cost-benefit of wearing a mask versus spreading Covid."
30585,But what I don't understand is people acting like wearing a mask is zero-cost.
30586,It's a cost to me.
30587,It's debilitating.
30588,It's oppressive.
30589,I hate it.
30590,And I'd like to get some consideration for having put up with it.
30591,Isn’t there always a health risk in the world to old and immunocompromised?

30665,"It took some time for me to find them, but here's the article about past SARS vaccine attempts:
https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/17460441.2019.1581171

""Vaccine formulations that have been developed against SARS-CoV not only fail to protect animal models of aged populations, but also result in immunopathology in younger populations, where SARS disease is enhanced in vaccinated groups that are subsequently challenged with SARS-CoV [118,119]."
30666,"In addition, vaccines generate memory immune responses to specific pathogens, and no vaccine formulations have been developed that are effective against multiple CoVs."
30667,"Due to the diversity of BatCoVs, it seems unlikely that current therapeutic strategies targeting specific SARS-CoV or MERS-CoV antigens will be efficacious against future coronaviruses that emerge into the human population."
30668,Vaccines formulated against the SARS-CoV epidemic antigens do not offer effective protection against SARS-like BatCoVs that are currently circulating in bat populations [15].
30669,"Rather, a modular vaccine platform that can be rapidly adjusted for newly emergent viral antigens in potentially pandemic CoVs may be able to provide emergency vaccine coverage against emergent viral strains."""
30670,"It's important to keep in mind that the above was published in 2019 and written prior to recent research, but the FDA Pfizer brief seems to suggest that the issues with younger populations have not been resolved."

30712,Is there any assistance for families who have to bury their loved ones who passed from COVID?
30713,Great that you wear a mask.
30714,I critisized the people in my country for almost never wearing masks.
30715,I think we misunderstood one another.
30716,Have a good day
30717,I am not an expert but I am a scientist (and I like to think pretty scientifically literate) and have been doing lots of reading/listening over the past few weeks because I share your concerns.
30718,"Someone else feel free to correct me but this is what I've gathered:

1) Historically, it is extremely rare for vaccines to cause negative long-term effects."
30719,"2) There is no known mechanism by which the mRNA vaccines could cause negative long-term effects, and there are many known mechanisms by which COVID-19 can cause negative long-term effects (including death, obviously)."
30720,mRNA cannot modify your DNA.
30721,"It goes into your body, your cells follow the instructions to make a protein, and your immune system learns to recognize that protein."
30722,Then the protein and mRNA are disposed of by some mechanism I cannot recall.
30723,3) The mRNA vaccines (BioNTech/Pfizer and Moderna) were designed pretty much as soon as the outbreak in China happened.
30724,This technology has been in the works for years and it only took BioNTech (not sure about Moderna) two days to figure out what mRNA sequence would be needed for a COVID vaccine.
30725,All the time since then has been for testing.
30726,"4) Yes, this was very fast."
30727,"But, keep in mind that this is because all the money and resources were being thrown at this."
30728,We haven't seen a combination of this level of scientific ability and deadliness of a disease before (SARS was deadlier but way less contagious and therefore less of a global concern).
30729,Someone had a great analogy: it's the difference between driving across a city in rush hour traffic (normal vaccine approval) and driving across the same city in the middle of the night (COVID vaccine approval).
30730,"You achieve the same thing, but there was way less stuff in your way."
30731,"To answer your last question, yes."
30732,Vaccine science is way way way ahead of where it was the last time a disease was deadly/contagious enough to shut down the world.
30733,agreed.
30734,I hope this becomes the new normal.
30735,"Russia, someone didn’t think this through."
30736,I'm confused about the loss of smell symptom.
30737,"Is it a complete loss, or do smells become weaker than normal?"
30738,Same with taste.
30739,"Does it disappear completely, or does everything taste watered down?"
30740,"I forgot that happened, as insane as it was at the time and that wasn't even that long ago my god."

30745,Don't count your chickens before they hatch.
30746,You're assuming everything goes well.
30747,We've already had a setback with Oxford that will set the timeline back a couple months back for country wide vaccination under that plan.
30748,It was a big misstep not to secure more that likely will cost us the 1st half of the summer.
30749,Next approvals aren't likely until the end of January after Moderna.
30750,"We'll get lucky if Pfizer sees a financial incentive to changing the US agreement, but that's not guaranteed."
30751,We need to hope there aren't issues with J&amp;J or we're actually in a bit of trouble.
30752,"Yes of course, hopefully we see approval for it in January."
30753,They just released some data today.
30754,Lolllll SAME thing happened to me the other day word for word

30770,The nerve of that guy!
30771,"I would imagine that the likelihood of the vaccine killing you (or anyone, for that matter) is 0%."
30772,"The covid CFR in the US is above 2%, and will likely rise in the coming months as healthcare systems are stretched."
30773,"That’s technically an infinite increase, but let’s just put it at 200%."
30774,So you have a 200% greater chance of dying from COVID than from the vaccine.
30775,Do you still eschew the vaccine?
30776,"Edited to add: I guessed the fatality rate of the vaccine at 0% based on clinical trials, which showed no one died from the vaccine itself."
30777,That’s not what this discussion is about

30937,I got an interview with a news agency in Puerto Rico regarding my experience in my Phase 3 vaccine trial.
30938,I actually got this interview scheduled for tomorrow after word spread that I got a letter from Moderna stating 94.5% efficacy and no safety concerns for vaccine trial participants and that they are seeking emergency FDA approval.
30939,Only thing is I haven't been unblinded yet although I did show symptoms on both vaccinations.

30944,What sort of questions can I anticipate?
30945,What would be my target audience?

30953,&gt; How dare someone think of asking a logical question apparently?
30954,The reason you're getting downvoted is likely because you don't know how the vaccine works if you think you can be contagious from it

30956,"The guidelines up to this point have allowed people in private offices to not wear a mask, which is what the rules are for people who come to our office (90% of people work from home or on construction sites)."
30957,I mean that’s the risk of vaccine is it not?
30958,Every single one no matter how long you test it could have adverse effects down the line.

30975,"I'm trying to think of a more effective way of stopping people from getting the vaccine and, short of side effects including death and body parts falling off, I'm struggling to think of one."
30976,They mentioned how the vast majority of side effects show up days to weeks after the shot which would’ve been seen already with the Pfizer and moderna vaccines.
30977,What if they didn’t have 14 days?
30978,"Unfortunately, it looks like most Americans in under 50 won’t be getting their vaccine until around July."

30993,The Ebola vaccine wasn't needed by quite literally hundreds of millions of people all at once.
30994,I hear what you are saying.
30995,There are some localized solutions for some of these problems.
30996,But trying to scale this up so hundreds of millions can be vaccinated within a few months is a logistical problem the likes of which have not been seen since WW2.

30998,The dry ice in the vaccine containers made by Pfizer must be replaced every 5 days or the vaccine will go bad.
30999,"Dry ice production is an odd thing, it can't be made in advance it must be made and then used."
31000,"So production and distribution of the dry ice needs to be coordinated with the production of the vaccine:

31004,Great post.
31005,The part about side-effects overwhelmingly showing up in days to weeks after the shot is a very important part to make people understand that it’s safe.
31006,Even with antivax.
31007,I think a lot of people want normalcy.
31008,Also I read at least one politician is thinking about giving $ to people who get it.

31045,"Believe what, I don't understand"
31046,“Significantly” is the operative word here.
31047,It does a lot of heavy lifting.
31048,There are more than a million currently operating physicians in America.
31049,1 in 8 Americans currently work in the medical profession.
31050,That’s ~40 million?
31051,A good chunk of those 40 million will be among the first vaccinated.
31052,There are &gt;50 million over the age of 62.
31053,There are ~20 million over the age of 75 and that population accounts for about 55-60% of the deaths.
31054,I don’t know what percent of that population will accept the vaccine.
31055,"But if we assume they are anything like the rest of us it will be, ballpark, 70%."
31056,We don’t have enough vaccine yet.
31057,Nobody should expect the vaccine to significantly change their lives before next Summer.
31058,"We will see a declining death rate, but that’s not likely to show up in the data until late January if for no other reason the vaccine hasn’t been distributed yet and takes ten days and two doses to start working."
31059,We have a long way to go.
31060,Christmas should be spent with the people in your household.
31061,Any deviation from that will cost lives.
31062,It's not immature.
31063,It's suppressing dangerous viewpoints that could convince people to not take the vaccine.
31064,COVID only dies if we kill it completely.

31097,"Again, this isn't opinion, this is fact."
31098,Bullshit - the net Economic benefit of vaccinating earlier is a drop in the ocean compared to the stimulus packages being proposed.
31099,They should have reserved more.
31100,Cost shouldn’t have been an objection.
31101,2021 better be fucking good or I'm moving to mars
31102,Similar side effects for biggest difference is storing it
31103,Donating to the government is a tax right off so they are really selling them to government for the price of whatever their right off is.
31104,Millions of dollars spent just to avoid trump having to admit he was wrong that could have gone to things that would actually help people.
31105,The estimates for the general public has been late April to early July is when there will be enough vaccines to begin to vaccinate the general public.
31106,Idk your state but some states will prioritize teachers before the gen public so you might be a bit before then
31107,&gt;The cost is negligible compared to what the effects are.
31108,**NOW** they are negligible.
31109,"But these deals were put in place at a time where there was no evidence that an MRNA vaccine would ever work, especially not against a coronavirus."
31110,"Its fun to nitpick the decisions and feel like we all know better but if you put yourself in their shoes 6-8 months ago you realize that most experts were claiming an effective vaccine might not even be possible, no one was thinking it could be this effective."

31126,We’re starting vaccinations in a week....
31127,Are you kidding?
31128,Little pushback?
31129,The common topic of discussion on this subreddit is how much people are pushing back and how that one person at Target who had their mask under their nose certainly killed their grandma.
31130,"While 50% of Americans have been going above and beyond staying home for a whole year, another 50% have been doing the bare minimum of wearing masks in public spaces."
31131,That’s it.
31132,Either this sub stays consistent or it doesn’t.
31133,This sub like to paint the picture that Americans aren’t complying with CDC guidelines.
31134,"Like I said, at best, we are doing the bare minimum of wearing masks in public spaces."
31135,But deaths... are still happening?
31136,Deaths are increasing.
31137,"When Biden said he urged Americans to wear to masks for his first 100 days, I was like, so fucking what?"
31138,This is going to save Americans?
31139,"We are maintaining and I’ll happily wear masks until 2022, but let’s not act like this claim (which is ESSENTIALLY what we’ve been doing as of now) is going to astronomically going to save lives."

31141,"If the vaccines do what we all expect them to do, the vaccines will reduce deaths dramatically going into Q3."
31142,Curve will be flattened.
31143,The young are not going to continue to put their lives on hold as they wait for their turn at a vaccine.
31144,"It’s unfortunate that a subsection of the population, those that are young but immunocompromised or having chronic disorders/diseases, will have to stay indoors for another year."
31145,But it’s not Americans fault.
31146,It’s the government to blame.

31177,"Obviously it is very bad that hospitals need to do this, but if you need to put extra patients somewhere, a hospital parking garage is a good choice, it's a large space which makes it harder for aerosol concentrations to build up, has decent ventilation because it has to meet car exhaust standards, is empty because visitors are banned, and unlike field hospitals, you still have access to all your resources such as diagnostic imaging one elevator ride away."

31275,I figured it would be too early to say yes or no quite yet.
31276,If hospitalisations and deaths have gone dramatically down then u imagine we'll see restrictions be lifted and a return to normality.
31277,That's the main reason we have these restrictions to protect our hospitals.

The thing that people either don't realize or ignore is that a whole lot of people have pre existing conditions that make COVD way worse."

31288,We are at 15 million confirmed cases right now and estimates are that the actual number is 8x that.
31289,So 120 million have/had it and should have immunity.
31290,That's already 36% of the population.
31291,Get these vaccines going soon and this pandemic is almost over.
31292,"I think I'll stick to listening to scientists and public health officials, instead of half of US adults....."
31293,"Oh, how long before the immunity kicks in after the shot?"

31296,"Meanwhile, our EMA stands still on approvals."
31297,My point exactly.
31298,"Shoulder works better, but if you insist..."
31299,So You’re anti vaccine?
31300,That's a bit of a lazy way of interpreting what's happening.
31301,"Like the Russian researcher says in the article, ""I think there's a struggle between scientists and politicians, and the latter are winning."""
31302,The trial and the data released are way insufficient to support the claims it is safe and 95% effective.
31303,That's a different beast than the problem with people not *wanting* to take a (more) proven vaccine.
31304,"Nope, when China are being shitty it's absolutely fair to call them out for it, but this isn't one of those times."

31311,"WHO are less reliable than Trump, but it is more the headline being stupid than anything else"
31312,This is incredible.
31313,It should speed up the timeline of the impact.
31314,If we really vaccinate 20M people (mostly those at risk) by the end of the year we will start seeing deaths drop significantly.
31315,I guess the WHO is not impressed with the vaccines that are over 90% effective.
31316,i don't understand why you are hostile.
31317,If they really believed it they would have taken the router and everyone in the household’s computer.
31318,They just took her phone and work computer.
31319,How in the hell do they have the numbers to support this given the few positive cases?
31320,I’m really hoping this data (raw data not summary) is made public to let academics go to town unlike what is usually the case for trials.
31321,https://law.yale.edu/sites/default/files/area/center/ghjp/documents/kapczynski_kim_fda_blueprint_commentary.pdf
31322,62% efficacy is good enough for approval.
31323,They can throw away the data that gave 90% efficacy and still be just fine.

31343,"I don't see it as rude, and neither did the 160 guests that we had to uninvite from our wedding due to covid precautions."
31344,All were very supportive and thanked us for keeping friends' and family's safety in mind.
31345,"Hell, most even sent gifts."
31346,The old wedding etiquette rules have gone completely out the window with covid.
31347,"Maybe we lucked out with supportive friends and family, but I find it hard to believe a wedding guest would view a couple as ""rude"" for something completely out of their control, like a worldwide pandemic."
31348,Love it!
31349,She’s my inspiration!
31350,This article headline is very misleading.
31351,"They were in the control group, but the boomer aunts on facebook won't read that, and post this as evidence to argue why one shouldn't get the vaccine."
31352,Really upsetting the US  passed on Pfizer doses.
31353,I was hoping so badly for vaccination in April.
31354,It seems the US government didn’t buy enough-can anyone explain?
31355,True but I really don’t think that the difference between 10 and 12 family members gathering for a holiday is really the breakpoint for this pandemic
31356,&gt;There is also the contingent that want lockdown to last forever which may have negative feelings towards progress.
31357,No there isn't?
31358,No one is enjoying lockdown.
31359,"I've literally only seen two camps: those that dislike it but know that it's necessary and for the greater good, and those that dislike and couldn't give a fuck about your grandma."
31360,2% jump for a vaccine that can save hundreds of thousands of lives?
31361,Aaaaah I misread the article.
31362,No I am 100% for raising taxes for the rich.
31363,"I’m sorry, but statistically, she’d more than likely vote for him."
31364,She's 91 next week so 11-12 years old during the Blitz (1940-41).
31365,Yes that’s correct.
31366,But no he literally said you get 50% immunity after the 1st shot and implied if people only got the 1st shot it’s enough.
31367,Like people are making up numbers.
31368,You need both shots and the week after so it’s 5 weeks for immunity with 2 doses.
31369,No of course not.
31370,I just wanted to say that reaching a specific temperature is not enough to see a certain effect (destruction of vaccine/hard boiled egg).
31371,Time is also an important factor.
31372,They wear masks in schools..
31373,"Well they didn’t take her router or her family’s computers, just her work computer and phone."
31374,You’d think they would take all that if they were looking for someone sending an illegal message.

31405,Same actually lol I cry and am a bit of a pill getting the flu vaccine.
31406,So I’m trying to be hype about this one.
31407,"Distribution is well planned, but the vaccine has not received it's emergency use authorization."
31408,The FDA advisory committee will meet on Thursday and you can expect approval soon after.
31409,The launch and initial dosing will begin right away.
31410,The UK used a shorter heath authority review and approved the vaccine sooner.
31411,That is why they are dosing now (had nothing to do with distribution planning).
31412,What would make you feel comfortable with the compressed timeline?
31413,Exactly!
31414,"A lot of people on this sub love you bash people for not huddling down and sitting down for a whole year, they love to feel righteous and above others."

31417,Most people don’t have the luxury to hunker down and not leave their house.

31429,SARS-CoV-2 genome isn’t segmented and thus doesn’t mutate as efficiently.
31430,They both however are RNA viruses and mutate as a result of errors caused by RNA polymerase.

31449,"An almost 4 in 10 chance that I'd still be vulnerable to the same virus that I will have - by the time I'm actually vaccinated - spent well over a year avoiding would hardly motivate me to go back to working in the office, going out, socializing, etc."
