0,Japan is also much more on board with mask wearing as a culture.
1,Before the pandemic it was normal to wear a mask if you were sick to prevent spreading your illness to others.
2,you're absolutely right.
3,We would be in a worse situation than last year without vaccines.
4,"Belgium one-ups that with 76%, in reality it is probably slightly higher because a lot of the international community in Brussels was vaccinated elsewhere but that is not registered."

7,Many people push for continued restrictions/NPIs after vaccination.
8,"When asked what the endpoint is in the US, the consensus seems to fall in the range of ""a few weeks to a few months"" after kids can get vaccinated."
9,Does the FDA thumbs up for kids 5-11 suffice for them (you) to attempt to ease up?
10,Or does it have to be the &lt; 4 age group as well before they (you) are comfortable with letting everyone get back to normal?
11,That is just false.
12,Stop pushing something you know nothing about.
13,I don‚Äôt know why it stood out to me but I like that you call it ‚Äúthe COVID‚Äù taking the actual acronym‚Äôs meaning into account
14,As anecdotal as it is.
15,"My wife is breastfeeding, and had‚Äôt had a period in the first 18 months after the baby was born."
16,"Spotting a week or so after the the first shot, then nothing."
17,That was 6 months ago.
18,And it‚Äôs very typical for her not to regain her periods until she completely weans the kids.
19,Around the 2.5 year mark.
20,So that was a very strange event if not related to the vaccine.
21,The best interpretation of the CDC's actions was that they were trying to work out the best political solution while saving the most lives.
22,During the development of the booster guidelines there was strong push back from the public health community and WHO for allowing for **any** boosters because they believed it would be better served vaccinating low-income countries first.
23,"Public health figures were basically trashing boosters and telling people that, ""[Americans have to recalibrate our expectations about what makes a vaccine successful."
24,"""](https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2021/08/americans-are-losing-sight-endgame/619916/) Implying we should just live with getting infected with COVID, ignoring the risks of long COVID or transmission."
25,"FDA was going to straight up cave to the pressure to do such a thing, but CDC essentially was like, ""*Keep it broad and we will make the rules.... Don't worry about it."
26,"Just confirm it is safe and effective*""."
27,Then the CDC chose the broadest set of rules they could legitimately claim.
28,This way they can pretend like they didn't open up the booster to the general population but still offer it to anyone that wanted one.
29,"As a result, criticism for providing any boosters fizzled."
30,Went in and got my third shot along with the flu vaccine.
31,I got a good giggle out of the people there by asking for ‚Äúall the diseases.‚Äù Felt completely fine afterwards.
32,That‚Äôs exactly what my doctor said.
33,"She‚Äôs like well everyone is high risk, just say you have higher blood pressure or you‚Äôre a little overweight."
34,"There, done, now I just authorized it."
35,"The RIVM (government) website is best, but only in Dutch"
36,"Yeah, I forgot about those three as well."
37,I was there pre-Zika.
38,Tropical diseases don't mess around.
39,Shoprite was who I used.
40,"Checked a box that said ""high risk employment""."
41,"I was actually in high risk employment, but they didn't verify anything."
42,Swollen lymph nodes?
43,"Can last for several weeks, mum got it after her 2nd shot, iirc around 2 weeks for her."
44,We pretty much knew its from the shot but we got it checked anyways.
45,It went away without treatment.
46,After her booster it got swollen again but was a lot milder and vanished after few days.
47,I am well aware of that lol.
48,Was just noting when talking about wanting higher % of people vaccinated in x country may not be realistically possible because the vaccine still isn't approved for kids in most countries so it does limit on who you can actually vaccinate.
49,"Americans need to use their ""yes, I'm over 18"" skills to schedule their boosters."
50,"I get it, but there are generally tons of open appointments."
51,I had a list of them come up with only 2 days notice.
52,I was the only person in line for a booster when I got to my pharmacy.
53,No sense in letting them possibly expire.
54,[removed]
55,Took the day off for my booster since I felt pretty run down for the first two doses.
56,Just had a little bit of a sore arm and totally could have worked.
57,"That was a tragically dumb, divisive move on their part."
58,Destroying the Amazon is too profitable for ranchers and business interests in Brazil for him to do that.
59,There's no profit in vaccine denial
60,You're welcome
61,Found patient zero
62,"Ah, I have been hearing both dates so it confused me."
63,Agreed.
64,"Also, I believe WDW spans two counties, so which transmission level to they go by?"
65,Ultimately Disney will do what's best for their bottom line.
66,"I‚Äôm guessing the infection, hospitalisation rates, and long term side effects of covid would be a lot worse without the vaccines."
67,Ah so seems like it‚Äôs a repeat of March where basically everyone qualifies under the guidelines they put out

73,It seems like waiting g for guidance almost always proves to be too late.
74,Got mine.
75,"I don‚Äôt care if I‚Äôm eligible, I need to protect my littles who are not eligible."

103,"This, like the Beta variant does show efficiency at evading antibodies sure (with Beta being the most effective)."
104,"However this proves my point, we've had Beta for a long time now and it hasn't really spread as its not quite as virulent and was far outcompeted by Alpha (then Delta)."
105,"In a way, Delta (being so contagious) was a blessing in disguise being it binds to our spike proteins quite effectively thus making it easier for our vaccines to neutralize them."
106,We should also try and put a number as to what they mean by 'high efficiency is evading antibodies'.
107,That could just mean vaccine efficacy goes down from 90% to 80%?
108,That's plenty effective still.

122,"Virtually everyone qualifies but because people are told they need to be ""high risk"" most people don't get one because they don't know that high risk and/or occupational exposure means.. 80-90% of US adults by the guidelines issued."
123,"This entire thing has just been absurd, and we're sleepwalking into an unnecessarily rough winter."
124,"With 90%+ of the population seropositive (either the easy way through vaccines or the hard way through infection), the deaths will not reach what we saw last winter or even this past fall, but it will still be far more deaths than if the FDA and CDC had just gotten their heads out of their asses two months ago with a clear message: ""all adults are eligible for a booster; while you maintain good protection from severe disease without a booster, we recommend a booster as it will help significantly reduce your risk of symptomatic infection and likely reduce the chance you spread to others."""
125,Instead you have this disastrous situation where individual states and cities are rebelling against the FDA/CDC guidance because they (the CDC/FDA) are being obtuse and political.
126,Unsure if I should get the booster in december a couple weeks before international travel.
127,I got fully vaccinated back in March/April but got a breakthrough covid infection late August/early September.
128,Haven‚Äôt found much guidance on these types of cases but was wondering if a booster would still help because Ive heard natural immunity starts to wane after about 3 months?
129,Paywalled.
130,And I believe Israel was sometimes even doing it at 5.
131,Good thing Asia‚Äôs most obese country is on top of covid vaccinations

170,Then what about the A.30 variant that has a heavily modified spike protein that evades the developed antibodies?
171,: https://www.nature.com/articles/s41423-021-00779-5
172,It‚Äôs just theater imo
173,COVID doesn't care who is eligible
174,So does this essentially mean even if every human was immunized tomorrow and we hit covid zero the virus would still have a resovoir to replicate and mutate in and therefor be almost impossible to ever fully eradicate?
175,I'm no expert in this but if it mutates in deer to specifically spread easier between them will it eventually lose its ability to infect humans efficacy or are we similar enough that those mutations in the deer could still be a danger to humans?

That's a really good point."
187,"Sorry, it's easy to think only of those eligible."
188,It seems we are finally getting to boosters which are expected to go to 50+ or underlying condition.
189,That will hopefully make a huge difference as they would have been more likely to have had an early AZ jab whereas later they moved nearly fully to mRNA.

294,"Residents exhibited both general and respiratory signs (59 % hyperthermia, 49 % cough, 42 % polypnea) together with geriatric syndromes (15 % falls, 10 % altered consciousness)."
295,The classification tree revealed 100 % COVID-19 probability in the following groups: i) residents younger than 90 with dyspnea and falls; ii) residents older than 90 with anorexia; iii) residents older than 90 without anorexia but with altered consciousness.
296,"Finally, 41 % of staff members diagnosed with COVID-19 were asymptomatic."
297,"Conclusions  
The pauci-symptomatic expression of COVID-19 in older residents, together with the high prevalence of asymptomatic forms in caregivers, justifies mass screening in nursing homes, possibly prioritizing residents with suggestive combinations of clinical signs including dyspnea, falls, anorexia and/or altered consciousness."

300,Japan had supply issues or logistic issues IIRC.
301,Hesitancy wasn't a problem for them.
302,Important to bear in mind that 93% figure you're referring to for Ireland is of the eligible population which i presume is 12+.
303,For 1st doses Ireland is at 76% fully [vaccinated ](https://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/covid-vaccine-tracker-global-distribution/) roughly similar to Japan.
304,Obviously with kids still not able to get vaccinated in Ireland that will make it impossible to reach much higher than 76% fully vaccinated.
305,Like the rest of Europe Ireland is likely having the issue of waning immunity since the vaccines seem to lose quite abit of efficacy against symptoms after 6 months.
306,How is Irelands hospitalizations and deaths fairing?
307,Hopefully the vaccines should be helping to keep thosr figures lower than previous waves.

311,You would think the COVID death rate (and long haulers) would have been enough.
312,"Abstract:

Profound T-cell lymphopenia is the hallmark of severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)."
313,T-cell proliferation is telomere length (TL) dependent and telomeres shorten with age.
314,"Older COVID-19 patients, we hypothesize, are, therefore, at a higher risk of having TL-dependent lymphopenia."
315,"We measured TL by the novel Telomere Shortest Length Assay (TeSLA), and by Southern blotting (SB) of the terminal restriction fragments in peripheral blood mononuclear cells of 17 COVID-19 and 21 non-COVID-19 patients, aged 87 ¬± 8 (mean ¬± SD) and 87 ¬± 9 years, respectively."
316,"TeSLA tallies and measures single telomeres, including short telomeres undetected by SB."
317,"Such telomeres are relevant to TL-mediated biological processes, including cell viability and senescence."
318,"TeSLA yields 2 key metrics: the proportions of telomeres with different lengths (expressed in %) and their mean (TeSLA mTL), (expressed in kb)."
319,Lymphocyte count (109/L) was 0.91 ¬± 0.42 in COVID-19 patients and 1.50 ¬± 0.50 in non-COVID-19 patients (p &lt; .001).
320,"In COVID-19 patients, but not in non-COVID-19 patients, lymphocyte count was inversely correlated with the proportion of telomeres shorter than 2 kb (p = .005) and positively correlated with TeSLA mTL (p = .03)."
321,Lymphocyte count was not significantly correlated with SB mTL in either COVID-19 or non-COVID-19 patients.
322,"We propose that compromised TL-dependent T-cell proliferative response, driven by short telomere in the TL distribution, contributes to COVID-19 lymphopenia among old adults."
323,We infer that infection with SARS-CoV-2 uncovers the limits of the TL reserves of older persons.

385,Although that could possibly be due to Japan having an older population so more of the population is eligible for a vaccine(kids under 12 still can't get vaccinated in most countries).
386,I guess a better way would be to compare the vaccine uptake amongst the eligible population.
387,I do find it weird how cases are roughly similar between England/Scotland(taking population differences into account of course).
388,Are people in Scotland actually wearing masks though?
389,I mean it's one thing to mandate masks but another thing to actually enforce mask wearing.
390,Restaurants are really busy.
391,"Since the state of emergency was eased and alcohol sales were reintroduced, everyone wants to go out again."
392,[removed]
393,So they have vaccinated with double dose 75% of all their population.
394,That's great.
395,Regardless of the answer the numbers a poo poo((

400,At the 11th hour the county forced their hand and implemented a mask mandate.
401,"My son is vaccinated, but I‚Äôm not willing to send him to a school that has already demonstrated they have no interest in protecting their students."
402,Yeah I'm in Ohio and they're talking about that here.
403,I worked as a lifeguard for a long time and we had to at least have proof of Hep B vaccination since we were exposed to blood when doing first aid for people.
404,(And injured people with cuts or other breaks in their skin were exposed to us!)
405,"Yeah, you wear gloves, but layers of protection are always a good thing."
406,Cedar Point even got in huge trouble and was nailed with a fine when they couldn't prove that all the lifeguards in their waterpark were up to date on their shots.
407,It just boggles my mind that apparently blood borne illnesses aren't important anymore?
408,"ABSTRACT  
Following the outbreak of the SARS-CoV-2 across the world in  
2020, millions of people were reduced in their mobility to hinder  
the spread of the disease."
409,"The lockdown was particularly difficult  
for older adults, who were deemed ‚Äòvulnerable‚Äô because many felt  
unsafe leaving the house and often forced to self-isolate."
410,"In this  
paper, we interpret the lockdowns as a period of prolonged  
stillness: breaks from everyday practices, including withdrawnness,   
inefficiency, and retreat."
411,"We extend ideas of stillness by  
integrating the capability approach, which shows how the opportunities   
and challenges that arise from moments of stillness are  
dependent on a combination of individual agency and the role of  
structural or contextual factors."
412,"Using the accounts of thirty-eight  
older adults in the Netherlands and England, we show how the  
COVID-19 lockdowns established and encouraged different types  
of stillness which had differing impacts upon the older adults‚Äô  
lives."
413,"The effect of the prolonged stillness on these different areas  
of everyday life is based on individual agency and contextual  
factors, such as choosing to volunteer or having an adequate  
internet connection."
414,"Thus, our findings contribute to discussions  
around active ageing and demonstrate that slowing down, and  
spending more time at home, can provide respite from an otherwise   
active everyday life."
415,"They'll be in the emergency room, taking up space other people need."
416,It's not helpful.
417,"It is a bad way of determining the larger reality, but the people assuming altruistic people more likely to be vaxxed are giving more blood are also just making things up."
418,It is very possible that a large amount of people giving blood have also been infected with COVID more so than the average population.
419,It doesn‚Äôt mean they have been vaxxed at higher rates.
420,We don‚Äôt really have enough information to make conclusions either way.
421,Is there a reference that cites this?

441,"Gottleib's outlook:

""As Delta is moving into the more populated parts of the US, like the region around the Great Lakes, the southwest, and New England, we have sharp declines in the south and southeast."

677,"With self driving cars, you get in an accident purely based on luck."
678,"Driving yourself, you think you have control over whether you do, although there's still random accidents even for the best drivers, that still make it more likely you'll get in an accident as long as there's people driving."
679,"With covid, people think they can avoid getting it or their immune system will prevent long term effects."
680,"If they get the shot, they are then giving up that control they feel from avoiding side effects and just get the roll of the dice."
681,"I think it's part of the reason it resonates so much with conservatives, because it feels right to them, even if the facts say very much the opposite."

690,Ask Rodgers if he thinks Fauci can be an NFL qb.
691,No?
692,That‚Äôs why Rodgers shouldn‚Äôt try to be a pandemic expert.
693,SMH.
694,One of the reasons this mass crippling  and death from the covid surge is a double edged sword is because on one hand it kills a lot of people unnecessarily and spreads endless tragedy but on the other it's going to make a massive amount of extremely red high population areas a lot more blue and make contests closer which may prevent similar thought processes from perpetuating long term.

700,That same quack doctor is says those dumb things is saying this?
701,Carrie whatsherface?
702,This sums it up nicely.
703,From the article it sounds as though very few or even none at all are outright denying there are any signs of sickness in their relatives.
704,It's pretty hard to deny some one is ill when clearly very ill and it's got to be harder to deny that someone is dying if clearly dying.
705,Not impossible but certainly difficult.
706,"Instead the people the doctors are dealing with seem to range from people who are hoping to ""get the brave/good doctors who will give the ivermectin"" to people who have convinced themselves it *must* be some other illness."
707,It's not a total denial of medicine.
708,It's a conspiracy and the doctors are either in on it or not allowed to speak up against it.
709,Or at least that's how I believe they see it.
710,Wait... NYC opened boosters for all?
711,I think its still technically medical conditions and 'essential/front line'.

721,"I'd wager that consuming a cup of borax (as some psychopath advised) has a higher hospitalisation rate than getting covid, so the detoxers might be causing more problems for the healthcare system than if they'd never got vaccinated in the first place."
722,Is this Europe's Delta surge?
723,Also while I never did it I asked my coworkers why they were.
724,They‚Äôd wear the surgical mask over the N95 so they could switch easily when they weren‚Äôt in a patient area anymore.
725,Otherwise they‚Äôd lose them or it‚Äôd get crumpled in their pocket and for a long time we had to wear the mask several days before we could get a new one.
726,That‚Äôs almost the entire article.
727,"Holy crap, your BMI only has to be 26 to qualify?"
728,"I already qualified due to having multiple psychiatric conditions, but I thought I didn't qualify for being obese because my BMI wasn't more than 40."
729,"Not at all, it should be simply ""lead""."
730,"""Lede"" is the first sentence in an article or paragraph, in journalist speak."

746,Does it mean *everyone* who gets it is unvaccinated?
747,That *most* people who get it are unvaccinated?
748,Or just that the unvaccinated make a disproportionate contribution?
749,"Do you look at the whole world, or just one country?"
750,"(Actually, there's quite a simple answer to the last one: pandemics are global events by definition, and the US is just 4% of the world)

This is one of many cases where ""fact-checking"" is ultimately about picking a definition."
751,"If you want to say that this bloke (whoever he is) is telling the truth, you can pick a narrow definition and say that it's *not* a pandemic of the unvaccinated because vaccinated people are still getting it in large numbers (and a few unfortunately die)."
752,"If you want to say he's lying, you can pick a broad definition and say it *is* a pandemic of the unvaccinated because unvaccinated people make it far worse than it needs to be."

915,All those people who are scared of getting the shots -- I can honestly sympathize with them.
916,I was one of the earliest people to get the shots thinking it wouldn't affect me and that the side effects are exaggerated.
917,"I'm not super old, never had issues w/ flu vaccines in the past, and have no underlying medical condition."
918,This vaccine was approved in a year whereas new vaccines often take a decade or more.
919,There simply isn't 10 years worth of data to understand the long term effects of this new vaccine.
920,Don't be too quick to judge those who don't want to get vaccinated.
921,It's a personal choice for themselves and their families.
922,I'm still debating whether to get the booster.
923,"I honestly feel like at some point, I'm going to do it and risk the impact on my heart because I care about my family and don't want to risk getting COVID (or passing it onto them)."

975,"New Zealand is 90% first dose, 81% second dose, with boosters available to everyone from the 29th of November."

&gt;	The hashtag ""Boycott Tesco"" did appear, however, to largely being driven by people tweeting it while mocking anti-vaxxers for opposing the advert."
1016,It sounds like the hashtag and the majority of the people using it are actually doing so ironically.
1017,"So, I don‚Äôt think there is actually a massive backlash to the advert, as the headline leads you to believe."
1018,This is a double-dip ad strategy for Tesco.

1024,"Why can't she get a booster, too?"
1025,&gt; I'm curious if you support restrictions/NPI during flu season?
1026,The CDC has an epidemic cutoff: something like a 97.5% p score.
1027,"This is exceeded 1.3 weeks a year on average, but generally more like 3 consecutive weeks during bad flu seasons and never otherwise."
1028,"Currently roughly  every state in the country is above it, and has been for nearly every week since the pandemic began."
1029,"How much we want to spend stopping those 3 weeks every other year is a pretty simple value-of-life question, and in a rational world vaccination would be the simple answer."
1030,But the current situation is not comparable to bi-annual epidemic flu at all.
1031,"Places that have anti-Delta NPI's have not had a Delta surge at all, and this isn't because they aren't going to have one - it's because they're all wearing masks."
1032,"They may be delaying it at too low of a hospitalization level, but the correct method of mitigation is to keep hospitals 25% full of Delta patients for as long as it takes to let everyone who wants to catch Delta."
1033,https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nvss/vsrr/covid19/excess_deaths.htm
1034,Cases are starting to increase nationally and in the northeast.

1037,"Eh, I don't think they meant anything deep by it."
1038,"I guess they could've gone for some other color combo but I bet there were way more stock images of this particular color combo and they just wanted to show a ""pill vs. pill"" image."

1040,"Important quotes:

""Although it‚Äôs apparent that human-to-deer transmission and deer-to-deer transmission can occur, neither of the studies discovered whether deer-to-human transmission is possible."
1041,"However, if the virus can jump from deers into humans then this has some worrying implications."""
1042,"&amp;#x200B;

""This is all speculative for now and more research is needed, but the risk to humans is thought to be low."
1043,"The US Department of Agriculture gave a statement to IFLScience in August that read: ‚ÄúCurrently, there is no evidence that animals play a significant role in spreading SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, to people."
1044,"The risk of animals, including deer, spreading COVID-19 to people is low."""
1045,"I'm wondering if the Pfizer pill works like the Merck one, i.e., by causing highly increased mutations in the virus causing it to die off, because... well, frankly, I am concerned that the mutations will not be limited to only the virus."
1046,"If I were on my deathbed I wouldn't second-guess taking something like that, but in terms of relaxing because some miracle cure is on the horizon, the way I understand at least the Merck pill, I ain't feeling it."

1049,Not enough.

1052,Overall?
1053,Germany had 97k Covid deaths as a comparison
1054,The only thing more exciting than a hero is a fallen hero.
1055,&gt; Japan aimed at planned and organized vaccine distribution unlike other countries.
1056,What I mean is that Japan made sure that for every vaccinated people there was a second vaccine available.
1057,Most countries did this though?

1065,Ireland has 92% fully vaccinated... We win
1066,This would be amazing!
1067,"The logistics would be so much easier, potentially it could even be posted or just picked up from a pharmacy, so you don't need all those vaccine volunteers and centres."
1068,Also great for the needle phobic.
1069,Does the weather cause it or just people doing stuff inside because of the weather?
1070,"If we have the evidence that these other adverse outcomes are higher/greater than the flu or other high risk illnesses that the 0-4 age group get, I'm happy to read up on the data to better inform my opinion."
1071,"As it is, based upon the available data that I've seen, there's a disproportionate response to COVID risk vs other risk among the very young."
1072,"If we're going to mask up and have restrictions in place for as long as the 0-4 group remains unvaccinated to protect them from an X% chance of harmful outcomes from COVID, it stands to reason that if something else like the flu has a greater than X% chance of harmful outcomes, we should impose restrictions in perpetuity as long as the flu exists."
1073,"And yet almost nobody I've ever met or seen seems to think we should do this, and nobody was making impassioned outcries for masking small children to protect them from other virus' before 2020."
1074,"Ah shit you right, forgot about that."
1075,My time perception has been screwed lately.
1076,"Believe it or not, common mental illnesses like depression and anxiety are considered qualifying conditions, so if you have one of those, you're set."
1077,12 and under have only qualified for shots for less than a month.

1188,"And wow, 2 years or nearly *half* your little guy's life occurring during the pandemic... it's crazy to think about!"
1189,My wife said the same thing the other day when my kids were getting shot#1 and how big of a deal it is because any kid under 10 years old has now spent a fairly significant portion of their life living through the pandemic.
1190,"My heart goes out to all the parents like you with children under 5... hang in there, it's right around the corner."

1194,Bud you are the one that made the claim.
1195,I'm trying to parse out how you think you made a coherent statement.
1196,Let's recap.
1197,This started with you saying this.
1198,"&gt;&gt; we have ample supply
&gt;
&gt;We don‚Äôt."
1199,Vaccines are expiring on the shelves.
1200,Lots of places are having shortages.
1201,This is a contradiction because the vaccine expiring means there's low demand due to no one taking it but you then claim we have no supply.
1202,I'm asking you to provide evidence this is true.
1203,Because either we somehow aren't getting new vaccine shipments(indicating a supply issue) or it's expiring on shelves(indicating a demand one).
1204,If we previously had a demand issue then demand would be up due to the boosters so why are they expiring?
1205,If we had a supply issue then how are there so many unused doses to the point that some are expiring on shelves?
1206,Do we somehow have a previously unseen supply issue that just so happens to coincide with booster availability?
1207,If so then link me to evidence of this.
1208,"In the US, the problem wasn't just on social media."
1209,"The President was constantly downplaying the virus, actively calling on his supporters to overthrow state governments that instituted lockdowns, rambling about drinking bleach on national television, and publicly attacking his own scientific advisors."
1210,This post appears to be about vaccines.

1228,Full stop.
1229,No one wants to mask forever to a disease that will stay forever with us.
1230,We will have to live on endemic covid with ups and downs without masks.
1231,I won¬¥t even start on the divide between very close places or US states with different mask policies or the effects of lifting and reinstating mandates on its enforcement or the weariness and distrsut on having an endless mandate.

1239,They said that 79% of the hospitalized are unvaccinated.

1261,"And honestly, if they open the floodgates for third doses and there becomes a shortage, I don't really have sympathy for people who never got their first or second shot."
1262,Pfizer has been FDA approved for almost 3 months and widely available for 6+ months.
1263,While covid can be a treat to babies we (Norway) are currently seeing a huge surge in RS-virus infections that puts a lot more children in intensive care than covid ever have.
1264,This is because normally 60-70% of children are exposed to this during their first year of life.

1301,The anti-vax crowd is preparing their argument that it was the vaccine mandate that is causing it.

1365,At least in my area those are booked out at least a month because of kid vaccines.
1366,"From the article:

‚ÄôJared Polis vowed Aug. 12 to take action before Colorado‚Äôs hospitals are overwhelmed with COVID patients."
1367,"They are nearly overwhelmed.‚Äô  
In early August, as coronavirus infections and hospitalizations first began rising in Colorado following a summer lull, Gov."
1368,Jared Polis stood before reporters to answer questions about the worrying trend.
1369,"Asked when he might consider reissuing a statewide mask mandate or other such aggressive virus-fighting actions, he was clear."
1370,"‚ÄúWe will not overwhelm our hospitals,‚Äù he said then."
1371,"‚ÄúWe will take the steps necessary to avoid doing that.‚Äù  
Later, he added: ‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt wait until we‚Äôre overwhelming our hospitals."
1372,"We watch the trend, and we act before we are overwhelming our hospitals.‚Äù  
Colorado is about to overwhelm its hospitals."
1373,"When Polis made his vow, on Aug. 12, there were 514 people hospitalized in Colorado with COVID-19."
1374,"On Wednesday, there were 1,431."
1375,The state‚Äôs intensive care units were 95% full.
1376,Epidemiologists expect more hospitalizations are on the way.
1377,The percentage of coronavirus tests coming back positive statewide is at nearly 10% ‚Äî double the goal for well-controlled transmission.
1378,"In a handful of counties, test positivity tops 20%."
1379,"Models now forecast that by the end of the year, if things remain on the same track, hundreds more coronavirus patients will need a hospital bed than the state currently has space for."
1380,Yet Polis has not given any indication that he intends to issue a mask mandate to slow the virus‚Äô spread and give hospitals breathing room.
1381,Some public health experts in the state believe it would help.
1382,"‚ÄúI do think that a statewide indoor mask mandate, potentially, could help the system right now,‚Äù said Dr. Anuj Mehta, a critical care pulmonologist at Denver Health who has sometimes advised the state on policy during the pandemic."
1383,"‚ÄúI think a statewide mask mandate ‚Äî my personal opinion ‚Äî would augment our ability to address some of the acute surge issues.‚Äù  
Polis and state health leaders have taken other measures to address the spike in hospitalizations."
1384,They have called in federal teams to help out in overworked hospitals.
1385,They have issued orders on hospital staffing and on patient transfers designed to make sure every last bed in the state can be used.
1386,"On Wednesday, Polis said the state would work to add 500 additional hospital beds in Colorado and would expand access to booster shots for the already vaccinated and to monoclonal antibody treatments for those in the early days of infection."
1387,"He said his administration would work with cities and with the operators of event venues to encourage them to require vaccination for attendees of large, indoor events."
1388,"‚ÄúWe know we need to do better; we are going to do better,‚Äù he said during a meeting with a group of his pandemic advisers."
1389,"‚ÄúAnd we are going to be working on policies that drive more Coloradans to get the life-saving vaccine.‚Äù  
If things get bad enough, he said the state may have to activate crisis triage protocols at hospitals."
1390,"But Polis, in recent public statements, has repeatedly declined to entertain the idea of reissuing the kind of statewide public health orders on masking or social distancing that he issued earlier in the pandemic."
1391,He has insisted that now is a different time in the pandemic and there‚Äôs a question of fairness: About 80% of people in Colorado‚Äôs hospitals with COVID are unvaccinated; so why should the majority of Coloradans who are vaccinated have to suffer through more restrictions?
1392,"‚ÄúI think most Coloradans are sick and tired of wearing masks to protect people who don‚Äôt seem to want to protect themselves,‚Äù he said earlier this month."

WASHINGTON ‚Äî The Food and Drug Administration is aiming to authorize booster doses of Pfizer-BioNTech‚Äôs coronavirus vaccine for all adults as early as Thursday, a move that would expand the number of Americans eligible for additional shots by tens of millions, according to people familiar with the agency‚Äôs plans."
1481,The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention‚Äôs independent committee of vaccine experts has scheduled a meeting for Friday to discuss data on the booster dose‚Äôs efficacy and safety.
1482,If both the F.D.A.
1483,and the C.D.C.
1484,"sign off this week, they will have acted strikingly quickly ‚Äî a little more than a week after Pfizer asked for authorization of boosters for everyone 18 and older."
1485,"Under that scenario, any adult who received a second dose of the vaccine at least six months earlier would be officially eligible to get a booster as soon as this weekend."
1486,The F.D.A.
1487,"is expected to rule without consulting its own expert panel, which has met frequently during the pandemic to review vaccine data and make a recommendation ahead of a regulatory decision."
1488,Moderna is expected to soon submit its own request for the F.D.A.
1489,to broaden eligibility for its booster.
1490,"But for now, every adult could get the Pfizer booster, according to people familiar with the planning."
1491,The broad booster authorization has been viewed as something of a fait accompli for weeks.
1492,Some state and local officials have begun rolling out similar policies ahead of F.D.A.
1493,action ‚Äî responding to persistent virus case counts and the eagerness of many Americans to seek additional protection ahead of holiday gatherings.
1494,New York City health officials on Monday encouraged all adults who want boosters to seek them out.
1495,"Arkansas, California, Colorado and New Mexico have already moved to expand access."
1496,"Many Americans, regardless of where they live, have taken the matter into their own hands and sought out extra doses even if they do not officially qualify yet."
1497,The F.D.A.
1498,"in September downsized Pfizer-BioNTech‚Äôs request to fully approve booster doses for all adults, instead signing off on a more limited population, including those 65 and older, as well as adults with underlying medical conditions or those at risk because of their jobs."
1499,"At least 30 to 40 percent of vaccinated adults are still excluded from booster eligibility, according to some estimates."
1500,"More than 30 million people have gotten additional shots, with the number often outpacing the number of first shots given each day around the country."
1501,"Booster doses were also authorized in October for everyone who received the single-dose Johnson &amp; Johnson vaccine, and for vulnerable groups who received Moderna‚Äôs two-dose shot."
1502,"The C.D.C.‚Äôs gathering on Friday is scheduled to be briefer than recent meetings about Covid vaccines, just three hours, and is expected to be straightforward, one federal official familiar with the planning said, in part because of how far the nation‚Äôs booster campaign has already come."
1503,That would suggest a significant softening of opposition among public health experts since President Biden announced in August that he hoped to offer booster doses to all adults.
1504,"Mr. Biden wanted to start the campaign in late September, but his announcement was heavily criticized by public health experts, who said he was rushing federal scientists and regulators who had to decide whether the data supported such a move."
1505,Members of the F.D.A.
1506,and C.D.C.
1507,advisory committees have said they were uncomfortable with how quickly the administration wanted to offer booster shots to a large swath of Americans.
1508,"Some key regulators and outside advisers had been hesitant to endorse a sweeping booster campaign this early, arguing that effectiveness of the two-dose regimen, especially in preventing hospitalization and death, has held up strongly."
1509,One large study in New York of nearly nine million people has shown remarkable durability in the protection gained from all three federally authorized vaccines.
1510,"But more recently, federal regulators and scientists have said the evidence is increasingly clear that a reduction in vaccine efficacy against milder Covid cases, and in protective antibodies, has put Americans ‚Äî especially seniors and those with medical conditions ‚Äî at risk of harmful breakthrough infections as the Delta variant of the virus only gradually loosens its grip."
1511,‚ÄúAntibodies decay with time.
1512,"That‚Äôs not just a coronavirus vaccine story,‚Äù said Dr. Ofer Levy, director of the Precision Vaccines Program at Harvard‚Äôs Boston Children‚Äôs Hospital and a member of the F.D.A."
1513,advisory committee.
1514,‚ÄúVaccines vary in the durability of the protective response.
1515,"We are starting to see waning in other age groups as well.‚Äù

An Israeli study published in the scientific journal The Lancet in late October compared about 730,000 people who had received a booster dose in August or September with individuals who had received only two doses of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine at least five months earlier, finding that boosted recipients had a lower risk of hospitalization and severe disease."
1516,Those with booster shots were evaluated between one week and nearly two months after their third dose.
1517,‚Äî Noah Weiland and Sharon LaFraniere
1518,"&gt; I don't really want to get these every 6 months forever

There's currently no reason to believe that this will naturally have to be the case."
1519,The initial doses were given very close together with no time for affinity maturation.
1520,Boosters may be much more durable.
1521,Many vaccines are given on a schedule spaced months apart.
1522,We did the initial doses very compressed due to the need to get the approvals through phase III quickly and get the largest number of people immunized as fast as possible.
1523,"Nope nope nope, I‚Äôm not even going to ask if we work for the same company."
1524,I don‚Äôt wanna know.
1525,üòÇ
1526,State vaccine laws + federal government mandating other things that are supposed to be left up to the states = precedent where the federal government can mandatory vaccines.
1527,"Sorry dude, you don‚Äôt understand this as well as you think."
1528,No one is going around saying the boosters make you impervious to infection.
1529,I‚Äôve not seen anyone suggesting that.
1530,"It does lessen your overall chances of suffering a breakthrough, but it‚Äôs not guaranteed."
1531,Delta is extremely virulent.
1532,"There is a rather large misconception because initially the original two dose vaccine regimen for the mRNA vaccines showed strong overall infection protection, but that was against the original and even the Alpha strain."
1533,Delta + time has made a very high level of protective immunity unlikely.
1534,"At this stage it‚Äôs about reducing severity first and foremost, and then hopefully preventing infection through a combination of having your booster and still using common sense to minimize your risk of contraction when and where it‚Äôs appropriate."
1535,The pandemic is far from over.
1536,Yep

1618,"&gt; Being vaccinated saves lives, but doesn't prevent spread."
1619,This is absolutely misinformation and you should edit your comment to reflect that.
1620,Being vaccinated reduces your chances of getting infected‚Äîwhich prevents you from spreading the disease.
1621,"Being vaccinated reduces the length of your infection if you do get a breakthrough infection, making you infectious for less long, which reduces your chances of spreading the disease."
1622,"And being vaccinated people with breakthroughs have less culturable virus present, even at the same Ct value (viral load), which makes them less infectious."
1623,&gt; Wearing a mask has been proven to prevent the spread of disease.
1624,"Masking does reduce the spread of covid, somewhat."
1625,**But it is less effective at that than vaccination** and it is absolutely bonkers/nonsense/crazy to assert that masking works to stop the spread but vaccination does not.
1626,"And yes, I am absolutely aware that the effect is multiplicative, so both masking and being vaccinated is better than just doing one thing."
1627,"But if you had to pick between being in a room with 20 unmasked, vaccinated people or 20 masked, unvaccinated people, you‚Äôd be wise to pick the room with the unmasked, vaccinated people."
1628,"&gt;  Wearing a mask, especially as a customer, is a trivial inconvenience

As a customer, I agree with you."
1629,But that isn‚Äôt all public indoor spaces.
1630,I would love to not have to mask at my gym *where every member is fully vaccinated*.
1631,"I‚Äôd gladly accept the (minimal, especially since I‚Äôve been boosted) covid risk in exchange for a more comfortable workout, and I know virtually everyone else at my gym feels the same way."
1632,Leave it to reddit to get angry about something positive.
1633,[removed]
1634,"My only concern is that the booster may cause a fever, which is normal."
1635,"However, the UTI may also cause a fever, which is typically a bad sign indicating a need for urgent treatment."
1636,"If you get a fever, you won't know which caused it."
1637,I'd wait it out until the infection clears and get the booster after you are all better.
1638,Show me a single reputable source that says being vaccinated is an equivalent replacement for being masked in terms of spreading the disease to others.
1639,Also how is suggesting that people should both be masked and vaccinated antivax?

There‚Äôs a huge difference, but no one can seem to tell me what it is"

1793,"If you haven't gone, do yourself a favor and go during cherry blossom season and hope you're lucky enough to be there at the right moment."

1795,"Japan, you are really amazing."
1796,"When did people forget that there's decades of ""dumb jock"" memes in hundreds of movies?"
1797,LIke that's an applicable joke for a reason.
1798,"A highly intelligent jock is the exception, it has never been the rule."
1799,I kinda don't give a fuck what he thinks.
1800,"About 83 percent of blood donors had infection-induced or vaccine-induced COVID-19 antibodies by May 2021, according to research published Sept. 2 in JAMA Network."

1806,COMMAS PLEASE
1807,I know that technically it can just be a coincidence that I had strange mid cycle spotting after my Covid shots.
1808,Lots of things can cause spotting.
1809,But I take lots of cycle notes in my tracking app because I'm a data nerd and I had no other instances of spotting at all during the pandemic.
1810,"And it's never happened after, say, the flu shot or any other vaccine I've had in recent memory."
1811,So I'm not 100% buying that there is no link.
1812,"I don't think it was a big deal, I'm very pro-vaccine, and aside from that my cycle was regular and stayed on track."
1813,"But it did happen, and I did note it, and the timing is a little sus, is all."
1814,Really perpetuating the dumb jock stereotype.
1815,Good job.
1816,I would disagree.
1817,The reason double vaxxed individuals showed such good resistance early in the Delta wave is due to the vaccine being very new.
1818,"As time has passed, infections and deaths among vaccinated have increased substantially."
1819,"Minnesota has a 60% vaccination rate, with over 40% of deaths being vaccinated individuals and rising."
1820,"There‚Äôs obviously alternative factors which may play a significant role, but it‚Äôs clear that boosters are the way to go after being initially double vaxxed."
1821,I‚Äôm not one to shame the unvaccinated.
1822,"It‚Äôs endemic, we have to live with it, and there‚Äôs a means by which people at substantial risk may protect themselves very effectively."
1823,"But, if vaccine immunity wanes and people don‚Äôt have the option to fully protect themselves, then that‚Äôs a serious problem."
1824,No.

1832,The rate around me is significantly lower.
1833,I didn't realize it was that high in the US.
1834,I am friends with a super religious but completely anti-vax family with 3 young kids that have had COVID as a family (tested positive by a doctor) twice in the past year.
1835,The husband works in a very public business and the mom makes things and sells them at fairs and such.
1836,"That scares me because I know there are a lot of people that will not get vaccinated for any reason, but I was really hoping that they would have immunity because they already had it."
1837,"This family got it back in January/February (if I remember correctly, I would have to look it up to be more precise, but it wasn't at the beginning of this pandemic) and just recently got it again."
1838,Everyone survived but I wonder why they got it again?
1839,I thought getting it provided immunity for awhile.
1840,I guess I need to research more.
1841,Kaaren Rodgers.
1842,Hahahaha .
1843,I should hope he is vaccinated going round all those peoples houses in one night.
1844,I shop at tesco though so if all the anti vaxx twats could boycotte it that would be great.

1899,"The fact that we allow full capacity at our sporting events when we have 5,000 cases a day and no vaccine/mask requirements in those venues is no better than what DeSantis is doing in Florida."

1917,Giving selective information is the only way anybody conveys any information ever.
1918,"Heres an example: Tom Brady is the greatest quarterback to ever play in the NFL, and proof of this is that hes won 6 super bowls."
1919,Do you see what I did there?
1920,"I left out the fact that he has also LOST 4 super bowls, because it didnt help me make the truth clear to people."
1921,"The truth is that hes a great QB, and yet I had to leave out truthful, but misleading, information in order to convey what I know the truth to be

Nobody can give you perfectly accurate information, because it is always based on what they perceive the truth to be."
1922,What people can do though is filter the facts into a story that will make sense to humans.
1923,"That is what the OP did, they understood the group to be people who associate with hate groups, and they provided factual evidence of that."
1924,"If they had perceived the group differently, they would have provided different factual information, so as to get their understanding of the truth across to people."

1926,The UK has never just opened vaccinations to everyone initially.
1927,The key group was the vulnerable.
1928,So they opened up to them 1st.
1929,Now they have enough capacity to open to the over 40s.
1930,"You need to wait for 6 months before you get booster, so many of us over 40 are not yet eligible."

1987,"With us here the cdc eased the mask mandates for the vaccinated, but since in Florida nobody is allowed to check the vaxx status of people it got wild and the anti vaxxers removed their masks, it was just when they saw how Delta destroyed India."
1988,Of course things got bad here over the summer and Florida had the worst outbreak ever.
1989,The governor then threatened schools to withhold funds from them if they force people into a mask mandate.

2006,Ventilation is horrendous in our schools as 99% will not have air condition and they're going to be cold now so it's unlikely windows will be open.
2007,The biggest age group for cases in UK has been 10-14 year olds.

2039,Government over there keeps constantly shifting the goalposts and it‚Äôs frustrating.
2040,Interesting thing I've seen in the UK.
2041,In England masks are not mandated anymore and the uptake from my experience is quite low now.
2042,But in Scotland it is still mandated.
2043,Case rates are very similar though.
2044,"It could be down to how we're so close on many things politically that the mandate doesn't make a difference in people's eyes, but there was always an argument initially that they won't ask people to wear them as they won't use them properly."
2045,"Maybe that is what is happening, as we haven't in the UK mandated clinical grade masks, only cloth."
2046,It's also like so many people are just so invested in moving on.
2047,My local small town paper has not covered the local pandemic in any meaningful way since last spring.

2057,And next to NO ONE paid attention when they said to put them back on.
2058,Detroit has a woeful vaccination level and I am not seeing much coverage on the pandemic in the Detroit Free Press--not like they used to cover it.
2059,And that is the biggest paper/news source in the state!
2060,"Until we hit 90+% vaxxed, we are doomed to just continue this over and over like Groundhog's Day."
2061,I am starting to know more and more people with breakthrough cases too.

2098,"This will mean an astronomical amount of increased spending as these people are taking more money to care for in terms of Medicare, Medicaid, federally provided healthcare and private health insurance."
2099,The social security system will be paying out a lot more and receiving less as people are rendered physically disabled by this disease and are not actively working and being contributers to the systems.

2101,"All in all a huge amount of fiscal pain for a whole lot of situations, and a not so insignificant portion of fiscal pain that could be avoided if people just listened to everyone from the president down for their local pharmacist and just took their needed, freely provided, vaccine course."

2106,LOL also not sure!
2107,But that's ok... it happens on reddit.
2108,Would love to hear why from a down voter...
2109,The point I was trying to get across was like... Man!
2110,That's fucking awesome!
2111,I have an immense respect for Japan.
2112,One of my absolute favorite places.
2113,I have so much respect for Japan I'd probably refrain from living there because I'd probably skirt the line on the side of annoying foreigners.
2114,I don't want to do that.
2115,"When I go there, I can cross at the cross walks at appropriate times, but I'd eventually end up fucking it up and pissing people off."
2116,I'd unknowingly walk into a restaurant and not know to remove my shoes.
2117,I'd do something inadvertently offensive.
2118,Are you an ex-pat?
2119,"Another reason is how intimidating trying to pick up a the Japanese language would be (for me, my brain just really REALLY struggles with picking up new languages, and the Japanese language is no joke) which would lead to me not understanding customs, what's appropriate, etc."
2120,"Anyways, once again, Japan, (from a visitors standpoint, maybe not knowing the nuances of the political unrest, etc...) you are STILL really amazing."
2121,"&gt;No one checks in restaurants or cinemas etc now

I got checked for my vaccine status on Saturday 100% of the time."
2122,"But they never checked, if i am actually that person ..."
2123,Syria also recently got 1 million Sinovac doses from WHO.
2124,Hopefully 1.5 mil doses will speed up the vaccinations
2125,[removed]
2126,[removed]
2127,That's hard to believe unless they are not counting children.
2128,Under 16 probably represents at least 15-20% (just a guesstimate) of the country.
2129,That would imply almost all 16 and older are vaccinated and near 30-50% under 16 are also vaccinated
2130,"&gt;But I mean again asking seriously, how on earth could we get anywhere near that level considering like 70% of germans are vaxxed now whereas virtually 0% were last Christmas?"
2131,The Covid-19 variant dominant last year had a R0 of 3 (So every case could lead to 3 others cases without any measures) The now dominant Delta variant has a R0 of 8 to 9.
2132,"So even with 65% of poplulation fully vaxxed, you get to the same new case ratio as last year."
2133,"Add in that vaccines are not 100% effective and measures are way less strict than last year, we have a bad winter coming..."
2134,[removed]
2135,[removed]
2136,"Spaces or nothing, commas are NOT the way to go, neither are decimal points.."
2137,[removed]
2138,But so what if we handled it better?
2139,There is no reward for it.
2140,The government refused to open back up despite a ridiculously high vaccination rate.
2141,Things still can‚Äôt go back to normal even if Singapore did everything the ‚Äúexperts‚Äù recommended.
2142,It seems the goalposts for opening up keep shifting.
2143,First it‚Äôs get to 80% vaccination rate.
2144,We got there and even exceeded that.
2145,What more do you want?
2146,It seems like there are some people who have a interest in keeping the restrictions going on indefinitely.
2147,"I'm not an expert, but I have read several articles about long COVID."
2148,this sounds like something different than the immune system issue.
2149,"the symptoms of people with long COVID immune system issues, if I remember correctly, are fatigue, brain fog, joint pain, fever, headache, exercise intolerance, etc"
2150,Ireland is at 90% with 2 doses.
2151,I herd there was a plan to start making vaccines alot more expensive for 1st world countries soon.
2152,I think people are missing the point here.
2153,MASKS!!
2154,"I think there were 9 cases of covid in Metro Tokyo yesterday, a city of 12,000,000 people."
2155,There have been NO discussions about loosening the mask mandate.
2156,Everyone wears a mask in Tokyo.
2157,Everyone.
2158,"The rest of the world was in such a hurry to ""get back to normal"" they did not listen to/heed the science."
2159,Now things are getting bad again.
2160,GEE!
2161,I wonder why?
2162,"I see news clips on TV CNN/BBC etc, very few people wearing masks."
2163,"I am a long time Tokyo resident, and have been fully vaccinated since mid July."
2164,"I am eagerly awaiting my booster shot, and I wear a mask every time I leave the house."
2165,"I definitely had a much, much heavier one than I've ever had after my second Moderna."
2166,"And, weirdly, a much, much lighter one than I've ever had after my booster."
2167,"I got COVID at a Halloween party I was hosting karaoke at the day before Halloween, in a suburb south of the Cities."
2168,"I was vaccinated in April but I guess it wore off because I got pretty sick, and I infected my husband, all four of my kids and my grandkid."
2169,I feel like an ass.
2170,I shouldn't have let my guard down and I can guarantee it won't happen again.
2171,Everyone up here is acting like the pandemic is over.
2172,I think they've been lulled into a false sense of complacency.
2173,(I know I was!)
2174,Or they just didn't care to begin with.
2175,It's going to get worse before it gets better.
2176,Let me correct you.
2177,"The Moderna booster is half the original doses, but the Pfizer one is the same as the first two."
2178,[removed]
2179,Europeans in shambles
2180,Spain is around 79% with 2 doses and Portugal is even higher.
2181,Although we are not G7 countries
2182,"Probably, because they realized that to push people to vaccinate, the people must be recognizing the danger."
2183,"A bit too late, sincerely, so can be to little effect, I'm afraid."
2184,"Not just the stats, they will also benefit from the higher vaccination rate."
2185,"It's true they have less children, but also true that this makes the higher vaccination rate easier."
2186,"Singapore pretty much did everything right, but now the US and the EU are treating it like the plague just because Covid cases are rising a bit."
2187,From a country that‚Äôs more vaccinated and handled the pandemic way better than the EU and the US.
2188,"Not sure why you got downvoted other than maybe off topic, but you're right."
2189,"I've been here 30 years and I love it, but it's not for everyone to stay here for the long term."
2190,"To get back on topic though, articles like this one are another reason I'm glad I stayed."
2191,Not that I need more reasons.
2192,But Japan's culture of being mostly agreeable and cooperative most of the time is what's getting them through Covid relatively unscathed.
2193,"The government made its share of mistakes, some of them big ones, but the social attitude and familiarity with wearing masks more than made up for it."
2194,[deleted]
2195,"South Korea's currently at 78% fully vaxxed, though they aren't a member of the G7."
2196,[Because it's true?

2199,Good point.
2200,Finally a legit reason for wearing a mask!
2201,[removed]
2202,"Yeah, I know for ages 12+ the UK vaccination rates are 88% one dose and 80% two doses, for example."
2203,I'd guess Japan being highest could be as much a comment on demographics (relatively old population by international standards) as on vaccine uptake.
2204,The worst thing about Facebook is you can't point out misinformation without promoting it because now it shows up on your wall.
2205,"People miss the ""commented on"" part and think you are just sharing the headline."
2206,The more you try to correct people the more you spread the misinfo.
2207,Do you know what could've caused that to happen?
2208,I remember him going to the hospital for a sinus infection for a couple of days or so.
2209,That was a couple of months ago.
2210,I wonder if what you mentioned and that can also be related.
2211,He never got one in his whole life until then.
2212,While I know of multiple people who had gotten them multiple times and never had them get that bad.
2213,Italy is at 73.5ish too
2214,And Minnesota snowbirds are headed down to Florida.
2215,Winter is here.
2216,"80% in over 12.. it's actually 68.5% of the population, like the 75% of Japan

I checked because I was sure we in Italy had over 80%, we have 84% of over 12 fully vaccinated, and 73.5% of the whole population"
2217,Similar story in Australia.
2218,Almost no one was vaccinated by the time Delta hit because our shitcunt of a PM couldn't be arsed picking up the phone and ordering enough for the country.
2219,"Once we actually had enough to go around, well we are now at 83.5% fully vaxxed nationally and 91.3% fully vaxxed in our most populous state (NSW)."
2220,"I am (and most people) are not scared to catch the virus - the probability of me (healthy, normal weighted and athlethic male between 35 and 45) getting serious issues is very unlikely."
2221,"The problem is: Small probabilities, when spread over a large number, still give large numbers."
2222,1% of 10000 is still 100.
2223,"Currently, Austria ""produces"" about 90-150 new ICU covid-patients."
2224,"We have 2100 ICU beds here (24 ICU beds per 100k population, which puts us in the top 5 in Europe)."
2225,"People stay at the ICU \~20 days, that makes approx."
2226,20\*120=2400 ICU beds needed - for Covid only.
2227,"But we have heart attacks, car accidents, cancer surgeries which usually require \~1600-2000 ICU beds without covid."
2228,That means: We'd need min.
2229,"2400+1600=4000 ICU beds (plus staff), when we only have \~2100."
2230,Awaiting your witty suggestions on how to solve this equation.

2253,"Health care workers may be more likely to donate, first responders, others in vaccine-mandated jobs."
2254,"Possibly older adults, who have higher vaccination rates and more time on their hands."
2255,Even discounting the percentage some modest amount doesn't really take away from the oven finding though: the overwhelming majority of people have antibodies from either infection or vaccination.
2256,"Yes, you're correct."
2257,I was more commenting on the article written about the study.
2258,I should've made that more clear.
2259,Rodgers is a much better player than Kaepernick.
2260,That's why he's still in the league.
2261,"From the paper‚Äôs abstract, the only indication of severity is the ~80% of individuals that were hospitalized at one point during their illness: ‚ÄúFrom a total of 2100 studies identified, 57 studies with 250‚ÄØ351 survivors of COVID-19 met inclusion criteria."
2262,"The mean (SD) age of survivors was 54.4 (8.9) years, 140‚ÄØ196 (56%) were male, and 197‚ÄØ777 (79%) were hospitalized during acute COVID-19."
2263,High-income countries contributed 45 studies (79%).
2264,"The median (IQR) proportion of COVID-19 survivors experiencing at least 1 PASC was 54.0% (45.0%-69.0%; 13 studies) at 1 month (short-term), 55.0% (34.8%-65.5%; 38 studies) at 2 to 5 months (intermediate-term), and 54.0% (31.0%-67.0%; 9 studies) at 6 or more months (long-term).‚Äù"

2426,"On the other, he has a huge platform, is very influential, and the only way he'd realize his actions have consequences is if it hit him in his wallet."
2427,It's simply not though.
2428,"The Sputnik vaccine is not approved in the EU, neither as a normal shot or a booster shot."
2429,We're now seeing signs of European countries requiring a booster shot of the J&amp;J vaccine.
2430,"A combination of Sputnik + J&amp;J and the will not give you the green pass for those countries in Europe (Austria for now), because Sputnik is simply not considered part of an 'acceptable vaccine regimen' as you put it inside the EU."

2434,Up until now I‚Äôve been wondering why my pms depression has been at an all time low the past few months.

2436,You know I can say with 100% certainty that some of the yokels taking ivermectin are going to find giant dead worms in their shit.
2437,Like no doubt.
2438,yeah 2013-2018 was probably the golden era for the podcast where he frequently had interesting guests.
2439,"I still listened at the start of covid, and ever since every episode has at least 30+ minutes of interrogating the guest on covid restrictions."

2456,The mimbo who knows so little about  everything and so lacking in any sort of personality except for his 1 skill that he just picks up all of the habits of his girlfriend.
2457,"Then if you rag on him he'll just mention about how much hotter the sex is, and all of his bros who worship him even in his early 30's now which is kind of getting weird will back him up, and then he'll start making out with some other woman later that evening."

2466,I think we were all fooled for a while by Rogan.
2467,It was quite telling that he had Alex Jones on and got pretty buddy-buddy.
2468,It's growing increasingly clear by his comments section who his fan base has become politically.
2469,"I'm over him, and while I enjoy some of the comics in his circle, Rogan's comedy has never attracted my interest."
2470,"hey, I am a healthy 22 year old guy with no immune system issues or anything like that, currently attending college, and I got my second Pfizer dose in early May."
2471,"Should I go ahead and get a booster now, or should I wait until it is officially available for 18+?"
2472,"Also, if I do get a booster, should I stick with the Pfizer vaccine, or get Moderna?"
2473,A big problem with these ‚ÄúI did my own research‚Äù people is that the research they did wasn‚Äôt actually research.
2474,It‚Äôs just a few podcast jocks and a couple of the same articles they read and think that‚Äôs what qualifies as research.
2475,They don‚Äôt understand that people FAR BETTER equipped actually did studies and testing and re-testing and re-testing to make sure that their information can be counted on.
2476,They didn‚Äôt just repeat what Joe Rogan said.
2477,Comments like this scare me... especially when its for a vaccine without sterilizing immunity and seemingly declining efficacy rates.
2478,I get that governments want to slow down hospitalizations but they are literally stripping away people's personal freedoms in order to force them into getting a vaccine...I am vaccinated but how people do not find actions like this alarming is baffling to me...
2479,Yeah.
2480,I forgot about that part.
2481,The next question I would ask is ‚Äúhas Fauci consulted Rogan?‚Äù

2506,Sure I could lie but that's not the way I work.
2507,Isn't this headline a little misleading?
2508,It's not like the CDC is making specific recommendations for masking at Disney World.
2509,"The county dropped down into moderate transmission, at which point there is no recommendation to wear a mask."
2510,Is this by number of donations or by actual donors?

2519,This is a universally recommended vaccine and we have the right to know what it's doing to our bodies or at least the 'why' !
2520,Anyone that attached politics to this shares the blame
2521,"I have, and I know the answer."
2522,The better question is why you haven‚Äôt.
2523,Generally pharmaceutical companies don‚Äôt want to put all their eggs in one basket by committing a potentially crippling level of resources and labor effort to one vaccine that may not be successful.
2524,They stay diversified.
2525,"In this case, the government absorbs some of the risk in concurrent trial scale-up (except Pfizer who risked their own money), so the companies know they won‚Äôt go bankrupt if they‚Äôre not the one that produces the final vaccine."
2526,"Sorry, ""Vaccine Product""."
2527,It's part way down in the middle.
2528,The guidelines as so loose that most Americans do qualify.

2533,[Canada is 75.057%](https://covid19tracker.ca/vaccinationtracker.html) which is lower than Japan.

2555,What bothers me the most is that this wasn‚Äôt even studied in the first place.
2556,Women who were in the studies commented that they were unable to report these side effects because no one measured them or asked about menstrual changes.
2557,"Because apparently no one even thought to track women‚Äôs reproductive health, like we‚Äôre just wind up toys that bleed every month."

2572,Here's a NYTimes article that agrees with the percentage: https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2021/world/covid-vaccinations-tracker.html

2575,He is no longer affiliated with BSW
2576,It‚Äôs really absurd.
2577,Let any willing individual get one FFS.
2578,There‚Äôs no way that does anything but increase the proportion of fully vaccinated + boosted individuals in the US and will only further help reduce cases and diminish severity.
2579,"Especially with relatively slow uptake, keeping it only for specific individuals at this point seems absurd."

2581,"Ah yes, cousins to the ""I did my own research"" crowd here in the states..."

2588,"&gt;Japanese ppl even used to wear masks to reduce effects of pollution

I've never heard of anyone wearing a mask here in Japan before because of pollution, you may be confusing it with Korea and China."
2589,Japan's air quality is quite good.
2590,"Masks are typically worn because of colds, pollen and for anonymity for insecure teens, women who don't want to wear makeup, people who are hungover, etc."
2591,Wow.

2607,"In the CDC vaccine advisory committee meeting, I think they said seroprevalence in the 5-11 age group was between 35-40%."
2608,Yes they allowed a lot of death and disability.
2609,And it‚Äôs following a seasonal pattern.
2610,Truly a beautiful country
2611,Oh I thought you were saying the vaccine causes ED
2612,That is not correct.
2613,"Japanese supply was fine, but the vaccines were not distributed, and there was a well documented hesitancy around vaccines that were not developed in Japan."
2614,"Obviously, that changed and they implemented a very successful vaccination campaign."
2615,They practically ran out of eligible people to vaccinated.
2616,It's totally possible to have high vaccination rates.
2617,"Other places would probably have similar vaccination rates, but supply/distribution issues have prevented people from getting them."
2618,It‚Äôs obviously not just science but a science/political hybrid.
2619,"I disagree, at least in the center of downtown."
2620,"In the places frequented by college students, especially restaurants, I see it consistently &lt;20%."

2629,&gt; Salzburg (dpa) - Hospital care in the Austrian state of Salzburg is on the brink due to the tense Corona situation.
2630,&gt; The Salzburg state clinics announced on Tuesday that a triage team was being put together because treatment of all patients according to the applicable standards could soon no longer be guaranteed.
2631,"According to the spokesman for the clinics, the team will in future advise who can still be treated in intensive care and who cannot."
2632,"&gt; With more than 1,500 new infections per 100,000 inhabitants, Salzburg currently has the highest seven-day incidence among the Austrian federal states."
2633,Upper Austria follows closely behind with a value of more than 1400.
2634,Austria's intensive care physicians therefore called for a short lockdown for the general population in these two regions on Tuesday.
2635,"The situation is ""very, very tense,"" said Walter Hasibeder, president of the √ñGARI professional association."
2636,"&gt; √ñVP against night exit restrictions

&gt; The conservative √ñVP of Federal Chancellor Alexander Schallenberg has vehemently opposed the initiative of Health Minister Wolfgang M√ºckstein (Greens) to introduce nationwide nocturnal exit restrictions in the past few days."
2637,"Instead, the conservative Chancellor Party is relying on the lockdown for unvaccinated people, which has been in force in Austria since Monday."
2638,M√ºckstein wants to reassess the situation on Wednesday.
2639,"&gt; In response to the call for help from the clinic operator with its four hospitals, Salzburg's head of state Wilfried Haslauer (√ñVP) announced relief measures."
2640,"Among other things, some corona patients are to be accommodated in centers for medical rehabilitation."

2669,It's a LOT LOT easier to manage it when your population is 5 million and your country is a 1/3 of the size of Tokyo
2670,Depends on the definition of surge.
2671,"If you scroll down to the active cases that is on a constant upwards trajectory, which was starting from an already high number."
2672,"And this is the general problem is that many places globally are going to start any sort of increase in transmission and cases from already high values, which gives very little room or time to implement other measures."
2673,"I mean, Singapore is 5 million people in a country 1/3 of the size of Tokyo, you can't remotely compare the situation to a European country"
2674,Thank you.

2676,There were no cases of SARS in Japan during the 02-04 epidemic.
2677,"And Canada had over 250, yet mask wearing has not become part of the culture there."

2689,It's especially for pollen on allergy seasons.
2690,Those get really nasty if you don't mask up and get an allergic reaction.

2728,Texas dumb.
2729,[removed]
2730,You really can't understand that there's vaccinated people with differing opinions to you on what restrictions the state should and should not be allowed to impose?
2731,"I'm another person who's ""fully vaccinated, but"" disagrees with this level of mandate - so I'm just trolling, right?"
2732,Teach them at home if the nurse is not qualified.
2733,Texas dumb.
2734,"It‚Äôs a culture thing

East Asians have always worn masks in public if they had a cold etc

Japanese ppl even used to wear masks to reduce effects of pollution"
2735,[removed]
2736,It‚Äôs not deceptive.
2737,It‚Äôs exactly the first paragraph.
2738,Texas dumb.
2739,Fired because if a shot.
2740,Lol
2741,I wondered that maybe the reason too.
2742,[removed]
2743,Ivermectin isn‚Äôt useful against COVID.
2744,Only dishonest doctors doing a money grab prescribe it.
2745,Imagine that a culture who puts others‚Äô interests on par with individual interests
2746,Texas dumb.
2747,[removed]
2748,"What is the base of these percentages: everybody regardless of age (0+), or over 12 year olds, or over 16 year olds?"
2749,"Out of an abundance of caution, I will now maintain 6‚Äô of social distance from deer."
2750,"Vaccine is part of the solution, not only solution though."
2751,Vaccine + masks + all the other measures to work together to end this pandemic.
2752,Pfizer is not a half dose booster.
2753,The booster is the same as the first two shots.
2754,Moderna is a half dose.
2755,[removed]
2756,"Probably a combination of the UK's problem of having a high case load when vaccination completes results in that case load continuing, and the US/Israel's problem of short vaccine spacing leading to immunity waning."
2757,"That said, the case load is still relatively low compared to other countries which are living with covid, per capita the case load per capita is about a quarter of the UK and Germany at the moment."
2758,Dumb asses must be from Texas.
2759,Texas dumb is real.
2760,So two shots a year.
2761,Do the side effects become better over time?
2762,Been sick three days after my initial two vaccinations each.
2763,"That‚Äôs debatable, many lost their jobs and are going hungry, and the country is more split."
2764,Those that were forced to get the vaccine may feel wronged.
2765,"Nope not buying it, do another study."
2766,I had two light but more painful periods during vaccination and they came early.
2767,It was mostly spotting but cramps were somehow worse.
2768,I was completely normal before and after.
2769,I feel bad for people whose cycles are taking longer to go back to normal.
2770,France is at 87.5% over 12yo.
2771,"I think the Netherlands is 84% from the target population , not from the total population."
2772,In that case Spain is around 90%
2773,"To put this into perspective:

&amp;#x200B;

* Around 94% of adults in the UK have received at least one dose of a COVID vaccine."
2774,"* Almost 90% in England, Wales and Scotland have received two (Northern Ireland is the exception, and is down at around 82% -- I'm not sure why there's a discrepancy there)."
2775,* A little under half of previously vaccine-hesitant adults are now vaccinated.
2776,"[Source](https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/healthandsocialcare/conditionsanddiseases/articles/coronaviruscovid19latestinsights/vaccines)

  
These views are not representative and I highly recommend not lending them your attention."
2777,[deleted]
2778,[removed]
2779,The UK staggered the vaccines by age groups.
2780,You can get the booster 6 months after your second vaccine.
2781,"I'm in my 30s, so expect them to open it to my age group next month or early January."
2782,[removed]
2783,And they were lagging in vaccine uptake months ago too.
2784,"I'm surprised it has taken them so long I wonder is that due to supply, logistics, or hesitancy?"
2785,Ireland has 93% fully jabbed but it doesn't seem to be helping  :(
2786,"Calling BS too, the vaccine definitely impacted my cycle."
2787,I get my booster tomorrow and hoping this doesn‚Äôt happen again.
2788,"However, I‚Äôd still rather deal with that instead of covid unprotected."
2789,Too bad they wane so quickly.
2790,"Yes, I'll have a read of that."
2791,My guess would be due to habits.
2792,"Stay in more, less ventilation with windows closed."
2793,Can't speak for OP but I will take whatever is recommended to me.
2794,I'm used to pinning from my Bodybuilding days I don't really care about an extra needle or two.
2795,Its half an hour out of my day every 6 months I genuinely couldn't care less heck they could post it to me and I'll happily do it myself.
2796,Weather has been shown to [affect transmission](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33419216/).
2797,"It's not completely proven yet, but it appears transmission increased as temp decreases and rain increases."
2798,Yeah the Netherlands is actually at 84.4% fully vaccinated.
2799,The g7 nations are lagging behind big time
2800,"Yes masks can help, but that is not the point, the point is vaccination, that is the real working solution."

2809,"can we just blame Republicans instead of pretending it's some vague ""politicization"" going on?"
2810,"Already vaxxed, what really bothers me is the school's  complete disregard for all the kids health and safety."
2811,There is no way they are going back there.
2812,Ever.
2813,If they care this little about a pandemic where do they stand on everything else?
2814,[removed]
2815,"They got it again because January/February was an earlier strain, maybe Alpha strain."
2816,"Recent strain would have been Delta, and immunity from earlier strains don't really protect well against Delta as it looks different to the immune system."
2817,"Plus, that's more than 6 months so their immunity would have waned."
2818,I think it will be tough winter for everywhere.
2819,I don't think it will be as bad as elsewhere or last year but the vaccine only plays a small part in limiting the spread.
2820,That may noticeably change with boosters though.
2821,"The key thing is, having enough of the right people vaccinated to stop hospitalisations / deaths."
2822,"If you make up your numbers by number of kids vaccinated, then its not going to help if many vulnerable are unvaccinated."
2823,Many parts of the US are possibly up shit creek due to the low level of vaccination.
2824,Interesting.
2825,I guess in cases like this sometimes silence is more convenient than spawning some new conspiracy.
2826,"The other scenario perhaps is that they never check sources anyway, so just carry on in blissful ignorance."
2827,Thanks for the update!
2828,Portugal is around 85% above 12 year olds with two doses and have started giving the third dose to 80+ and now 70+ year olds.
2829,There‚Äôs a difference between saying everybody not vaccinated is a piece of shit and saying there is likely a correlative selection bias between people willing to get vaccinated (good for public health) and people willing to give blood (good for public health).
2830,"It simply calls into question if there is a bias in the statistic, not implies every anti vaxxed is a piece of shit in every facet of their life, as you so eloquently put it"
2831,"It's troubling that they are so vaccinated, yet the country of 32 million is still getting 5k cases per day."
2832,"At 65,000 cases approximately 1 in every 500 people has Covid right now."
2833,The whole state is almost out of ICU beds as well.
2834,"&gt;The fact that we allow full capacity at our sporting events

Every part of the US has had full capacity at sporting events for awhile."

2862,Because the vaccine doesn't stop the spread?
2863,literally proven scientifically and is easily googled.
2864,"It keeps you away from the hospital, thats it."
2865,"Doesn't do shit against the spread of the virus, hence why many countries with highest vax numbers still have a surge in cases, not deaths, but cases."
2866,Very logical conclusion.
2867,I could care less if you like my attitude as much as I could care less if they die or not

2902,Just wanted to make sure I was understanding eligibility correctly.
2903,I‚Äôm impressed that china managed to vaccinate over 76% with a population of 1.4 billion.
2904,Guess authoritarian government is good for something
2905,This study was done using a full dose Moderna tho right?
2906,Moderna boosters are a half dose (at least up here in Canada).
2907,Pfizer is a full dose.
2908,Curious on the difference with that type of dosage.
2909,[removed]
2910,"It‚Äôs still a **pandemic** to the unvaccinated: very high rates of hospitalization and death 

But to the vaccinated, it‚Äôs largely moved into the *endemic phase*: still circulating, some level of risk, but within generally tolerable levels sans major mitigation efforts 

Problem is, both groups interact with each other, and perhaps more importantly, share hospital capacity &amp; healthcare resources - so while the unvaxed group shrinking, it‚Äôs still large enough that we can‚Äôt collectively move into the endemic phase"
2911,Gonna need to have actual enforcement and consequences or things will not change.
2912,I went to CVS after Walgreens turned me away.
2913,CVS did not ask any questions and gave me a Moderna booster.

2922,"When I arrived, i was asked if I met the Pfizer criteria."
2923,"I do not, and I didn't lie, but I pointed out that their website and the CDC say that J&amp;J recipients over 18 and at least two months out qualify."
2924,The tech kept showing me a piece of paper that she had to fill out stating that I met the Pfizer/Moderna criteria and that I was ineligible.
2925,I showed her that the paper said that J&amp;J recipients need not fill out the form.
2926,"She refused, but I haven't been able to let it go."
2927,"I called the pharmacy back for clarification, and they told me that they haven't heard of a J&amp;J booster anywhere."
2928,"When i said it was on their website, they said it is a national site and may not apply to my state."
2929,"When i called corporate, they said the mistake was mine for chosing a location that only offered Pfizer (none of their locations has J&amp;J available)."
2930,I was then told that they don't mix and match.

2954,"From what I read elsewhere, the Brazilian people are getting vaccinated at higher rates than the US."

2956,"the immunity is based on how your body creates antibodies that stop the virus, the vaccine itself isn't what protects you from the virus, the vaccine tricks your body into thinking you were infected and onto making the antibodies to fight the virus, this is why it takes time for you to be protected after getting vaccinated."
2957,way too many people don't know how vaccines work and don't know what a virus actually is or how they work.
2958,this is also why vaccines have limited to zero effectiveness against other strains.

3005,So I live in Michigan and it seems EVERYONE around me is getting it now.
3006,In fact my own household got COVID a month ago.
3007,Both my wife and I are vaccinated with boosters.
3008,"She got it, my 12 year old (who was in-between first dose and second dose) got it and my 7 year old ..."
3009,"I somehow, avoided it."
3010,I couldn't really isolate because my wife got pretty sick (not dangerously or anything just bad flu) so I had to deal with the kids....
3011,This seems to be a situation everywhere.
3012,"The only people I personally know that have gotten COVID, aside from children, were vaccinated."
3013,I'm trying to find info on this.
3014,"They can't go to school for two weeks after coming back from the US, so we're seriously considering taking our kids over there the first day of Christmas break.."

3020,I wish it were that simple showing statistical data.
3021,They just simply wave it off saying: ‚ÄúThe numbers are inflated‚Äù
3022,"I've had the flu a handful of times and while it can be very unpleasant, I can't recall that I ever felt like I was going to die."
3023,I get my flu shot every year because my wife schedules us to get the vaccine together with our child and drives us to the appointment :-D
3024,What‚Äôs wrong with her face?
3025,It looks like it‚Äôs melting off.
3026,The vaccine is out of your system within days.

3647,A significant majority of people went out to get vaccinated.
3648,How is that low demand?
3649,Compared to what?
3650,&gt; Now we don't have enough because it expired and demand went up.
3651,You‚Äôve lost me.
3652,Demand has gone up from what?
3653,Less people are going to get boosters than got their first shots so what are you comparing?
3654,&gt; This should be causing a mass shortage.
3655,"Again, according to what?"
3656,Me saying *lots of places*?
3657,That just means more than a few but also means not everywhere.
3658,*Mass* would imply a majority.
3659,*Lots* just implies more than a few.
3660,&gt; So...where is it?
3661,You haven't provided evidence of such.
3662,Just fear mongering that it will be a problem.
3663,Where is the mass shortage you inferred by your poor comprehension?
3664,I don‚Äôt know and feel no obligation to entertain.

3666,"Believe it or not, the guy won't listen to me."
3667,"If it's not over now, you're basically saying you want to keep restrictions forever."
3668,There's a broad agreement among epidemiologists that covid will never go away and will never be substantially better than it is now.

3670,I never comment here but - also chiming into say BULLSHIT.
3671,My cycle was affected too (heaviest bleeding I've had in 5 years).
3672,I'm not worried about it in the least.
3673,But something in this study is off when you have so many women with experiences to the contrary.
3674,The medical gaslighting has to stop.
3675,"""The outbreak occurred prior to boosters being made available."""
3676,Smart move.
3677,"Just as flu and cold season are starting up, not to mention there‚Äôs still an going pandemic going on."
3678,üôÑ
3679,"""Dangerous"", in this case simply means jobs that put you at higher risk of exposure to the virus, which any person who doesn't work from home and interacts with multiple people every day can honestly say without having to fib."
3680,"You are agreeing with me, no need for ""but"""
3681,"You almost make it sound as if they're different countries with different geographies, peoples, histories, cultures, languages, laws, foods, etc."
3682,Nearly everything you said is incorrect.
3683,Vaccines reduce infection substantially.
3684,With a 3rd dose they block the vast majority of transmission.
3685,Masks only work until you take them off.
3686,Please don't spread misinformation.
3687,"there has been a fair bit of data that suggests longer periods between vaccinations, such as the 6 mos, fairs better for stronger and longer-lasting immune responses."
3688,Got my jandj booster 2 weeks ago gf got hers the next day.
3689,Convincing everyone in my family to quit fucking around and go get a booster.
3690,Figure since I convinced them to get jab initially I should be more forceful this time around.
3691,Yes and the only stats they have is 18 and up or 12 and up.
3692,Or am I stupid?
3693,I'm dutch btw so I can read it.
3694,I really hope they open up again soon.
3695,I had to cancel my dream trip there in 2020.
3696,"Selfish, I know."
3697,i am hoping that this pill will put an end to covid (not the virus but the  problems it is causing).
3698,"It looks like it should, but one thing that I have realised is that many of my predictions around covid have been completely wrong."
3699,Fingers crossed its the panacea we need
3700,I have friends in the medical field who've gotten their boosters in the last month.
3701,"They tested positive for covid two days ago, mild cold-like symptoms thankfully."
3702,"By all means, everyone should get their boosters, but no one should think that getting the booster means that they're completely in the clear from potentially contracting the virus still."
3703,"Either way, I'm sure there will be plenty of antivaxxers who'll use breakthrough cases to further their braindead outlook on all this."
3704,"But the 77,000 employees do, and they‚Äôre exposed more when fewer people wear masks or when everyone is wearing cloth masks instead of protective masks."
3705,oh no‚Ä¶the timeline matches up too üò¨
3706,The CDC didn‚Äôt actually do anything here though.
3707,Did you actually read the article?
3708,"First post, ah the joy of the holidays, your post, then the bills arrive."
3709,"Not only that, but Japan is also collectivist (more of a focus on ‚Äúus‚Äù rather than ‚Äúme‚Äù) which is in stark contrast to an individualist nation like the United States."
3710,Bet they don‚Äôt have all of these fools running around vehemently refusing the vax and mask.
3711,Unfortunately this will be the future for many.
3712,The hybrid work model will be way worse than just WFH.
3713,My mother was in a similar situation just after Christmas.
3714,A number of nursing homes had infections.
3715,"8 people passed very quickly in hers, after 47 of 50 residents came down with it."
3716,My mother survived and so did the majority of residents and staff.
3717,"There was a seemingly frail 104 year old woman who had it and survived, making her British Columbia‚Äôs oldest covid survivor."
3718,"She eventually passed in the summer, several months after her infection had subsided."
3719,This all came before vaccines were available.
3720,"Even vaccinated, I‚Äôm sure these people were in for a fight and my thoughts are with family."
3721,"It‚Äôs extremely confusing &amp; depressing for residents, as they are all likely cut off from family and likely one another as well while the situation develops."
3722,Allowing it to spread will create more mutations at faster rate.
3723,Feds have to be vaccinated by early December.
3724,We run the registry so fake card fraud is essentially impossible.
3725,There are exemptions but they‚Äôre being extremely strict with them.
3726,Well over 90% will be vaccinated by early Dec.
3727,The ones who aren‚Äôt will be in process to firing.
3728,They'll still make loads of money though.

3731,Albertson's here too - I got mine when we were grocery shopping and on a whim I asked the pharmacist if they were giving them out.
3732,"Other than checking a box (tobacco smoker for me, though it's been 20 years since I smoked) no one asked me anything and I had my shot and a 10% off groceries coupon shortly after."
3733,Trvia: The two famous NFL figures who are Butte alums are Aaron Rodgers and Bill O'Brien's chin.
3734,As a scientist I can agree that the last 7 years have seen the CDC highly politicized with their guidances not coming from trained scientists bit White House political advisors.
3735,&gt;This is insubordination in my opinion.
3736,"If one soldier is insubordinate, they're fucked."
3737,"If a lot of soldiers are insubordinate, the military unit is fucked."
3738,"If enough units are insubordinate, the nation is fucked."
3739,I agree.
3740,Stay masked folks.
3741,As Europe is showing: no masks = more hospital tasks
3742,They're kind of right.
3743,The overwhelming majority of eligible people have had their vaccines.
3744,Anti-vaxxers are a much smaller minority in the UK.
3745,They're just make a lot of noise.
3746,"The CVS scheduler worked just fine for me and I don‚Äôt think it requested any information that would disqualify  most people from getting a booster, and unlike Walgreens."
3747,I‚Äôve was able to schedule my flu shot simultaneously.
3748,Very cool.
3749,I'm not sure we have that here yet.
3750,"[Here is a study from Tufts University](https://now.tufts.edu/news-releases/survey-despite-similar-levels-vaccine-hesitancy-white-people-more-likely-be-vaccinated) that shows that Black and White folks have similar levels of vaccine hesitancy, but Black folks lag behind in vaccination rates suggesting some other causal factor."
3751,The study also finds that Hispanic/Latino and Asian Americans have lower levels of vaccine hesitancy than White and Black folks.
3752,"[Here is another study from the Kaiser Foundation](https://www.kff.org/coronavirus-covid-19/poll-finding/kff-covid-19-vaccine-monitor-profile-of-the-unvaccinated/) that shows that the factors most associated with vaccine resistance are low levels of education, being younger, and being Republican."
3753,"If you read the article, pay close attention to the discussion of the differences between the groups that says they will ""definitely NOT get"" the vaccine, and the group that says they want to ""wait and see"" if it it safe and effective."
3754,"The ""definitely not"" group is predominantly white and Republican, while the ""wait and see"" group is Black, Latino and politically mixed."
3755,But none of this is surprising in the least for people familiar with the research literature on race/ethnicity and trust of the medical industry.
3756,"There is a well documented history of discrimination and ethical failure in the way health care and medical research treats people of color, poor folks, women, prisoners, etc."
3757,I would say the one thing missing from this conversation is the intersection of race/ethnicity and class.
3758,"It is kind of hinted at in the use of ""educational level,"" but I think in this case education is a poor substitute for class."
3759,The same legitimate mistrust of medicine (due to historical mistreatment) that underlies Black and Latino resistance to vaccines probably plays a role in lower income and working class white resistance.
3760,But pulling mistrust of medicine apart from the influence of political commitments (Republicanism) and vaccine misinformation (from both the left and the right of the political spectrum) among lower income White folks is very difficult.
3761,"""Doing my own research"" is my new go-to euphemism whenever nature calls."
3762,"Hold on, I've got another one-liner."
3763,"Aaron Rodgers has been called a ""thinker"" by many people, all of whom have a lisp."
3764,Kids under 4 exist and are unprotected.
3765,"So yes, we want protection for our children before returning to normal."
3766,It almost makes sense that somewhere in the range of half of the unvaccinated Americans had exposure to Covid-19 six months ago.
3767,The people who never knew they had Covid-19 (mild cases) is likely to have been higher than experts estimated.
3768,[deleted]
3769,The only relevant I see in this metric is protection against severe outcomes.
3770,Otherwise it means very little.
3771,"I remember UK registered very high % as well, and then Delta ravaged them."
3772,"In terms of containment we already know that the only thing that matters right now is how high your antibody count is, not whether you have some."
3773,It's not truly endemic anywhere in the world because nearly all infections are still  in naive adult hosts.
3774,This means individual severity is still very high in each specific age bracket.
3775,True endemic will be when all such hosts have been exposed and only unvaccinated kindergartners and reinfections are available as hosts.

3781,New cases in all of Canada today: 998.
3782,"New cases in just Vienna today: 1,200."
3783,"In all of Austria today: 10,363 and counting."
3784,"Every single day the past 10 days or so it's been over 10,000."
3785,It's ridiculous.
3786,"I walked through downtown Vienna yesterday evening and the restaurants were full, nobody on the streets wearing a mask."

3794,Get your third dose and you can stop worrying.
3795,from my understanding its because even tho the vaccinated % may well be  high in CA...california's population is just so damn high that almost 10million people arent vaxxed.
3796,10 million is a lotta folks.
3797,"(Michigan is the 10th most populated state at 9.9 million....40 states of the 50 have populations leas than the unvaccinated population of just California) 


is this why there is so much concern?"
3798,I'm vaccinated and boosted and still wear a mask around.
3799,"At this point i think it shows you have some form of social responsibility, regardless of if youre vaccinated, or if its mandated or not."
3800,"The person you're walking by could have become uncomfortable in public since the pandemic started, is immuno-compromised, or for whatever other reason, more succeptable to the virus than the average person whether they know it or not."

3818,In MN there is no mask mandate.
3819,And it's been said multiple times if you are vaccinated you are safe to not where a mask.

3821,Guess that's the state of things these days.
3822,"Aaron went on Pat's podcast, and said what he felt about his own personal opinions on the matter."
3823,"About how he personally sees it, and told people, ""don't listen to me, or base your care off of what I do or did, but instead talk to your doctor, and do what is best for you."
3824,"I'm sorry, but if you didn't get that from what he said, then your comprehension level is low, imo."
3825,"He also didn't just decide one day, ""hey, I know what's best or better for everyone."""
3826,"He isn't anti vaccine/vaccination, in the broad sense of the word."
3827,"In the past, way before Covid-19 was even a thing, Aaron had lightly discussed having some pretty intense allergies, to different things."
3828,You are acting like Aaron Rodgers wanted to openly discuss and push an anti vaccination agenda from the beginning.
3829,He didn't.
3830,He doesn't.
3831,It's why he didn't just come out from the beginning and say he wasn't vaccinated and give his personal reasons for coming to that decision.
3832,"He knew or at least speculated, that you and everyone else that is and has attacked him, would do exactly what you are doing."
3833,"Every single time anyone belittles him, or gets mad at him, it is proving his initial speculation, to be true."
3834,Only further enforcing his feelings about the topic.
3835,Let me ask you this.
3836,Did you look into the vaccines prior to taking them?
3837,Or did you just get vaccinated without weighing any possible risk?
3838,And so I'm clear.
3839,I'm pro vaccine.
3840,I've been voluntarily getting a flu vaccine every year for the past 22 years.
3841,"And when the mRNA vaccines came out, I was excited to get vaccinated against Covid."
3842,"But I did also look at different studies, consulted, not only my doctor, but also some friends I have in the epidemiology field, to better understand the science behind them, to better weigh the risks of getting vaccinated versus not getting vaccinated and getting Covid."
3843,"After looking at those personal risks, and the risk associated with others, due to me working in a hospital, and decided I was willing to risk the low chance of negative side effects of getting one of the mRNA vaccines, I got vaccinated."
3844,"But unlike Aaron Rodgers, and other people, not the majority of people, but of a minority of people, I've had no history of being allergic to any of the ingredients in the vaccines."
3845,Which certainly made my decision to get vaccinated against Covid much easier.
3846,"Humans, as a whole, are extremely similar, biologically speaking, but pretty much every human on this planet, does in fact have different interactions with different compounds/elements."
3847,"Some people are completely allergy free, and others are highly allergic to a slew of things."
3848,I have family members and friends that can't handle peanuts or latex.
3849,"Me on the other hand love a good pb&amp;j, and have no issue wearing certain gloves or eating bananas."
3850,"We as humans, are effected by different things, differently."
3851,"And an inability to accept this truth, is a short coming of yours, and many other humans out there."
3852,"And just like you have the, ""right,"" to share your disagreement with Aaron Rodgers' opinions, or my understanding of his position on the matter."
3853,"He has the right to his opinions, and I have the right to voice an understanding of why I believe he came to have those opinions."

3859,I'm confused how exactly people are missing the point to be honest.
3860,"I admit I can't read the article because it's not in English, but going by the good ol' ""I only read the title"", the point is exactly as the title suggests."
3861,It has nothing to do with masking.
3862,"It seems you're introducing another reason for why Japan has low case counts, that's fine."
3863,"In regard to masking, the actual science on masking is really really difficult to nail down."
3864,"It's a super hot button topic, but you'll see completely mixed discussion on scientific subs like /r/COVID19 for example."
3865,"And before the angry mob comes down with the downvote hammer, I mask at all times, everywhere."
3866,"I think more scientists than not agree that masking is an important NPI, but you'll not find a single one that says it's even remotely on the level of vaccination."
3867,"The smallest country in Europe is Cyprus and it's 12 times the size of Singapore... 

Beside, it's pretty obvious that when people refer to the main European countries, to which they compare Singapore, they aren't talking about the tiny fiscal paradises or developing countries like Azerbaijan..."
3868,&gt;The Kaiser poll shows basically the same thing.
3869,A clear majority (65%) of Democrats indicated that they had received or will definitely receive the flu shot.
3870,Just 40% of Republicans indicated they would.
3871,"Flu shot uptake now has a 25 point partisan divide (68% vs 44%, different poll, same results) just like the Covid vaccines."
3872,"In February 2020, that divide was only 4 points."
3873,"58% vs 54%, negligible."
3874,"2016 was nearly identical, 55% vs 53%."
3875,Okay so we had the vaccine and demand was low.
3876,Now we don't have enough because it expired and demand went up.
3877,This should be causing a mass shortage.
3878,So...where is it?
3879,You haven't provided evidence of such.
3880,Just fear mongering that it will be a problem.

3883,"They‚Äôre not nearly as laggy as deaths, only behind by a few days if I recall correctly"
3884,I wonder what percentage of eligible voters who passed away were Republican voters.
3885,Based on demographics and correlations with healthcare and education quality and how those affect COVID outcomes.
3886,Just age alone points to majority R voters being among the dead.
3887,"Even if it doesn't flip districts, it certainly accelerates the inevitable emergence of a larger, younger block of voters that want nothing to do with the American right."
3888,Exactly.
3889,"In Vermont or New York everyone over 18 can get one, but in New Hampshire I have to work a certain job or have a certain illness?"
3890,"And the CDC came out a couple weeks ago saying that anyone with any form of mental illness like depression or anxiety qualifies for a booster, but my doctors office and the pharmacies haven‚Äôt added that to the list."

3892,Sooo then what do you prefer?
3893,No treatments?
3894,"Fact is, big Pharma is the only way to ever make effective drugs."
3895,"New drugs cost millions to develop, test and release."
3896,&gt; Giving selective information is the only way anybody conveys any information ever.
3897,"Heres an example: Tom Brady is the greatest quarterback to ever play in the NFL, and proof of this is that hes won 6 super bowls."
3898,Do you see what I did there?
3899,"I left out the fact that he has also LOST 4 super bowls, because it didnt help me make the truth clear to people."
3900,"The truth is that hes a great QB, and yet I had to leave out truthful, but misleading, information in order to convey what I know the truth to be

And, of course, to a statistician, losing four Super Bowls actually helps his case, since that means he led the team that finished in 2nd place those years."
3901,Losing the Super Bowl is better than not going at all.
3902,"Though, people reading the info will see a negative-looking word like ""lost"" and come away with the wrong impression, so I can see how it's difficult to convey the right message by adhering strictly to a policy of reporting every relevant fact."

3914,Health bodies (those at the top) need to take this seriously.
3915,My wife is convinced that if men were complaining about erection malfunctions at the same level there would be paper after paper on the subject.
3916,I tend to agree.
3917,"This reeks of blatant sexism or, at the very least, sad ignorance."
3918,If you want to continue to give fuel to the anti-vax narrative then they will continue to release these shoddy claims.
3919,It is terrible policy to set up a world where doing the right thing requires you to lie.
3920,"This happened to me, too."
3921,"I had ended my period a week and a half before, and randomly started bleeding heavily again after my vaccine."
3922,"I‚Äôm still incredibly glad I got my vaccine, but it was rather alarming at the time."
3923,doh
3924,"Not yet, sorry."
3925,It is incredibly unlikely that antibody levels are lower than that.
3926,"We have over 70% fully vaccinated, and something like half of people have been infected."
3927,There are several places (7-8) with +1000 incidence.
3928,Insane.
3929,"A booster, for someone who had 2 mrna vaccines 6+ months ago, is 90% more effective than just the original 2 doses."
3930,"I'm not sure what misinformation you are referring to, but mrna folks getting a booster is a no-brainer."
3931,That‚Äôs great considering the shit show they were reporting during the Olympic Games
3932,Florida already got caught playing down the statistics for that state.
3933,"ah- a one cent fine

that'll show em"
3934,"&gt;A local government in eastern China said it had reassigned decontamination workers and called on them to apologize after they entered a quarantined resident‚Äôs apartment and beat a pet corgi with a metal rod, triggering anger online."
3935,"&gt;Video of the incident, from a home security camera, circulated widely on Chinese social media on Saturday."
3936,It showed two workers in white hazmat suits pursuing the dog in an unoccupied apartment.
3937,It yelps as one worker swings at it with a metal bar.
3938,Then it is briefly caught in the legs of a table as it flees to another room off camera.
3939,"&gt;The dog‚Äôs death was not shown, but state media reports later said it had been culled."
3940,"The vague wording of the Xinzhou district government‚Äôs statement Saturday, which said workers had ‚Äúdecontaminated‚Äù the animal though there was no indication it had been infected with the coronavirus, helped fuel the outcry."
3941,&gt;The pet‚Äôs owner or owners could not be reached for comment.
3942,"According to an account on the Twitter-like platform Weibo that first shared the video, the owners had been sent to hotel quarantine along with other residents of their neighborhood in the city of Shangrao, in Jiangxi Province."
3943,"Jiangxi is experiencing a small-scale coronavirus outbreak, with more than 70 cases reported since the end of last month."
3944,&gt;Quarantined residents were asked to leave their apartments so local government workers could disinfect them.
3945,"But unlike in other Chinese cities, which allowed owners to take pets into quarantine or even arranged boarding, no preparations for animals appear to have been made."
3946,&gt;It was unclear why the dog was killed.
3947,"In other parts of China, a small number of animals have been killed as part of the pandemic response, including three cats that were euthanized in the northern city of Harbin in September after they were found to be infected with the coronavirus."
3948,"Before the pandemic, some Chinese cities carried out large-scale campaigns to cull unregistered dogs and cats."

3960,I always understood that testing was just one tool in the Swiss Army knife of pandemic control.
3961,"If people get lax about masks, isolating at onset of symptoms and social distancing, testing can only do so much."
3962,"That said, I am not in Medicine."
3963,....who pays them?
3964,It isn't Oklahoma.
3965,"They conduct under the auspices of the federal government, that makes their ultimate authority the Pentagon."
3966,Just dishonorably discharge them and be done with it....

3968,"my wife, fully vaxxed, got covid also at work (RT) and since she got it in Aug/14/2021 has not been able to go back to work due to the same symptoms."
3969,She wonders if she can ever work again.
3970,her covid was VERY mild... but the long covid shit is not mild at all.
3971,Every job is a high risk job in a pandemic!
3972,"I know, that's where I got my numbers from."
3973,"That's why I was wondering, although I can only find from 12 years and up."
3974,"When I made my appointment with CVS, they didn't ask anything about eligibility other than when I had my second shot."
3975,I only skipped them ultimately because I could get the booster at Walmart without waiting and without driving.
3976,"Walmart did make me claim to have a high-risk job, which is only sort of true (my husband has one, not me), but ""high-risk job"" is such a vague term that it's hardly even lying."
3977,"And that particular guideline is *intentionally* vague, specifically to allow people to do that."
3978,"&gt;Spain‚Äôs Basque region on Tuesday announced new restrictions on gatherings to control its latest coronavirus wave, after months in which Spain stood out as a country that had largely reined in the pandemic, in particular thanks to a high vaccination rate."
3979,"&gt;The virus has spread unevenly in Spain in recent weeks, and the infection rates in the Basque region and neighboring Navarra are now more than twice the national average."
3980,Lawmakers in the worst-hit regions are leading a nationwide debate over whether Spain should reintroduce more restrictions to prevent a serious Covid-19 resurgence this winter.
3981,"&gt;The Basque regional government said that all areas in which the infection rate exceeds 150 cases per 100,000 inhabitants should suspend mass events and other gatherings, in particular those where food and drinks were served and where social distancing could not be guaranteed."
3982,"The region‚Äôs 14-day average infection rate climbed just above 180 per 100,000 inhabitants this weekend, compared with a nationwide rate on Monday of 82 cases per 100,000 inhabitants, according to Spain‚Äôs health ministry."
3983,&gt;The regional government said it would also ask the Basque judiciary to mandate proof of Covid-19 vaccination for people seeking to enter restaurants and nightclubs.
3984,"&gt;‚ÄùWe are not doing well,‚Äù Gotzone Sagardui, the regional health minister, told a news conference, adding that the virus was again spreading ‚Äúwith a worrying speed of growth.‚Äù

&gt;Spain‚Äôs health regulators lowered the country‚Äôs status to ‚Äúlow risk‚Äù in October after a plunge in the nationwide infection rate from a summer peak of over 700 cases per 100,000 inhabitants in late July."
3985,"That improvement was largely attributed to a successful vaccination campaign, and 79 percent of the population is now fully vaccinated."
3986,"&gt;Booster shots are now being given to people who are over 70 or living in nursing homes, and Spain‚Äôs government is expected to soon offer vaccinations to children under 12."
3987,"&gt;At the same time, however, the country‚Äôs pandemic response has recently involved a patchwork of restrictions put in place by regional governments, which are responsible for health care."
3988,"&gt;I√±igo Urkullu, the Basque region‚Äôs leader, has led a push to require vaccination in certain business sectors ‚Äî as has happened sweepingly in Italy and some other countries ‚Äî and has urged Spain‚Äôs central government to set nationwide rules."

4002,"The problem is these people don't understand the scientific method or statistics in the first place, nor do they have the scientific literacy to evaluate the sources of their research."
4003,"When I was in uni we had an entire half-semester course dedicated to just those concepts, that they'd moved to first year from third because highschools are simply not teaching them well."
4004,"Honestly, that course provided more critical thinking ability and has had more real-world applications than anything else I learned in a classroom, and it really should be a standard highschool class."
4005,I got turned away at Walgreens and CVS but was able to get one without an appointment at Walmart.
4006,"I could get one with an appointment at CVS, but they were booked the entire week unless I was willing to drive 20 miles."
4007,"Which I was, but I just walked to Walmart instead."
4008,"&gt;Amazon has agreed to pay $500,000 to help enforce California‚Äôs consumer protection laws after the company was accused of concealing Covid-19 case numbers from its workers, officials said on Monday."
4009,"&gt;The judgment, which is subject to court approval, is the first of its kind nationwide and is in line with a California ‚Äúright to know‚Äù law that was designed to keep workers safe during the pandemic, according to a news release from the attorney general‚Äôs office."
4010,"&gt;Under the arrangement, Amazon must also tell its warehouse workers within a day about the exact number of new Covid-19 cases in their workplaces, ensure that notifications adequately inform workers of the company‚Äôs disinfection and safety plans, tell health officials about new cases and submit to monitoring by the attorney general‚Äôs office regarding its Covid-19 notifications."
4011,"&gt;‚ÄùWe‚Äôre glad to have this resolved,‚Äù Barbara Agrait, a spokeswoman for Amazon, said in an emailed statement."
4012,"She said the attorney general‚Äôs office ‚Äúfound no substantive issues with the safety measures in our buildings,‚Äù only with technical aspects of how the company communicated broadly with its workers."
4013,"&gt;‚ÄùWe‚Äôve worked hard from the beginning of the pandemic to keep our employees safe and deliver for our customers ‚Äî incurring more than $15 billion in costs to date ‚Äî and we‚Äôll keep doing that in months and years ahead,‚Äù Ms. Agrait said."
4014,&gt;A complaint filed in Superior Court in Sacramento maintained that Amazon‚Äôs actions had prevented employees and the public from gaining full access to information regarding Covid-19 cases.
4015,"&gt;The state‚Äôs attorney general, Rob Bonta, said that such information was crucial for workers making difficult decisions regarding their health in the pandemic."
4016,"&gt;‚ÄùAmazon‚Äôs practices led to workers not knowing if they had been potentially exposed to two, 20 or even 200 cases of Covid-19,‚Äù he said at a news conference on Monday."
4017,"‚ÄúThis left many workers understandably terrified and powerless to make informed decisions to protect themselves and to protect their loved ones.‚Äù

&gt;No corporation is too big to follow the law,‚Äù Mr. Bonta said."
4018,"‚ÄúThis is a huge win for the safety and health of Amazon‚Äôs tens of thousands of warehouse workers, their families and our communities throughout this state.‚Äù

&gt;He said that the judgment sent a clear message that businesses must comply with the law, and that it was particularly important as the busy holiday season approached."

4034,"New York City will welcome crowds back to Times Square this New Year‚Äôs Eve, Mayor Bill de Blasio said Tuesday, as long as they provide proof that they are fully vaccinated against the coronavirus."
4035,"After a pared-down celebration last year, the longtime tradition of the ball drop at midnight will return to the city ‚Äúat full strength,‚Äù he said."
4036,"‚ÄúWe want to welcome all those hundreds of thousands of folks, but everyone needs to be vaccinated,‚Äù Mr. de Blasio said during a news conference."
4037,"‚ÄúJoin the crowd, join the joy, join a historic moment as New York City provides further evidence to the world that we are 100 percent back.‚Äù

Attendees who are unable to provide proof of vaccination because of a disability will have to show that they received a negative coronavirus test within 72 hours of the event, and children younger than 5 will have to be accompanied by someone with proof of vaccination."
4038,"The announcement comes as Mr. de Blasio is preparing for his successor, Eric Adams, to take over as the next mayor of New York City, and the ball drop will coincide with Mr. de Blasio‚Äôs final day in office."
4039,"That will leave any fallout from the event in the hands of Mr. Adams, who will be inaugurated on Jan. 1, 2022."
4040,"Several public health experts have warned that with the constantly changing nature of the coronavirus, it is difficult to predict where the city might be in terms of cases by the end of the year."
4041,"‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not going to be perfect,‚Äù said Denis Nash, a professor of epidemiology for the City University of New York Graduate School of Public Health and Health Policy."
4042,"‚ÄúWe have to assume there will be people with Covid mixing among the revelers outdoors.‚Äù

Nor is the risk limited to Times Square."
4043,"Attendees will also have to consider what happens on the way to the ball drop, with people going in and out of nearby bars and restaurants to eat, get warm and use the restroom."
4044,"And with some major restrictions against international travelers recently eased by the United States, the ball drop is likely to attract partygoers from around the country and the world, drawing together people from areas of both lower and higher rates of the virus."
4045,"Danielle Ompad, an associate professor of epidemiology at New York University, said she would still urge attendees to exercise caution when deciding whether or not to go."
4046,"‚ÄúI understand that people are so over this pandemic, and people are getting vaccinated and our vaccination rates are high,‚Äù Ms. Ompad said."
4047,"‚ÄúBut I still think it is important to be cautious.‚Äù

Wafaa El-Sadr, an epidemiology professor at Columbia University, expressed similar concerns: ‚ÄúI would say, ‚ÄòI‚Äôll wait for another year and choose to watch it from home.‚Äô‚Äù

4076,"&gt;At demonstrations against pandemic restrictions last week in Wellington, the New Zealand capital, some protesters performed the ceremonial Maori dance known as the Ka Mate haka, known internationally for its performance before rugby games."
4077,"&gt;Ngati Toa, the Maori tribe that owns the legal rights to that haka, on Monday called for them to stop."
4078,"‚ÄúWe insist that protesters stop using our taonga immediately,‚Äù Taku Parai, a senior member of Ngati Toa, said in a statement, using the Maori word for a treasure."
4079,"‚ÄúWe do not support their position.‚Äù

&gt;A law passed by the New Zealand government in 2014 recognized the tribe, or iwi, as the custodians of the haka."
4080,"Ka Mate dates back to 1820 and recounts the story of the heroic escape of Te Rauparaha, a chieftain, from capture by a rival tribe."
4081,Ngati Toa has previously spoken out against its misuse for commercial gain.
4082,"&gt;Historically, pandemics have posed a particular threat to Maori, New Zealand‚Äôs Indigenous people."
4083,"The 1918 flu pandemic devastated Maori communities, killing Maori at a rate seven times that of the wider population, while in the 2009 H1N1 influenza pandemic, the rate of infection for Maori was twice that of white New Zealanders."
4084,&gt;The present coronavirus pandemic has again hit Maori disproportionately.
4085,"As of March, half of those in New Zealand who had ended up in intensive care because of the virus had been Maori, despite their making up only 14 percent of the population."
4086,"The vaccination rate among Maori lags behind the rest of the country, with 77 percent of those eligible having received at least one dose of a vaccine, compared to 90 percent in the wider population."
4087,"&gt;In light of this history, and of the ancestors they have lost to these illnesses, the tribe has taken a proactive role in vaccinating its members against the coronavirus, said Helmut Modlik, a senior member of Ngati Toa."
4088,"&gt;‚ÄùWe are absolutely clear that the Covid-19 vaccine is the best protection we have available to us, and we are committed to supporting our whƒÅnau to get vaccinated as soon as possible,‚Äù Dr. Modlik added."

4098,"Just an awful, awful decision."
4099,I'd say the vaccine is choosing to have all the safety features installed on your car.
4100,Being unvaccinated is driving around without a seatbelt even installed.
4101,"If you get in an accident, it can still be the result of your own actions - maybe you forgot your seatbelt, or decided to take a crazy crowded highway - but the person who has the safety features installed is far more likely to survive and escape with less injury."
4102,Car insurance would be more like the healthcare system itself.
4103,Public healthcare (focused on prevention and risk management) tells you to get the safety features installed so acute healthcare systems (focused on repair and recovery after an indicent occurs) don't have as much work to do and will likely cost less to use if needed.

4149,I'm well aware of the political undertones which is why I said at the end the CDC/FDA were being political.
4150,The entire premise of vaccine equity was nonsense to begin with.
4151,"It was somewhat relevant when the discussion about boosters first came up in June back when production was still a bottleneck, but by the time the decision was made in September it was a moot point."
4152,"Distribution had become the bottleneck for vaccines, not production."
4153,"I posted at length about this [here](https://old.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/qa328n/top_virologist_says_delta_defeated_predicts_6/hh0yzyf/) a month ago, and it is even more true today than it was last month."
4154,"Global doses administered have risen significantly in the past month *because* of boosters being administered in the EU, US, and other large developed countries."
4155,"In the past several weeks, we crossed a milestone: more than half of the world's adult (18+) population has already been fully vaccinated."
4156,"Every incremental percent of vaccination after that point will become incrementally harder; as an example, the US peaked in vaccine administration long before we reached 50% of the eligible population fully vaccinated."
4157,"As much as the WHO likes to pretend that the world is just waiting with sleeves rolled up for a shot, the reality is that they are not."
4158,"There are a few large countries that still have some supply bottlenecks, especially for second dose delivery, but they are the exception and not the rule."
4159,"Africa could use more vaccines, but for the places that need them the most, COVID is hardly a big issue."
4160,"In a region where 65%+ of the population is under 30 and far more people are dying from traditional diseases (diarrheal diseases, malaria, ...), COVID doesn't even register as a blip."
4161,"Not saying that we should ignore these countries, but getting a COVID vaccine isn't high on someone's priority list when their kids are hungry and they don't have clean water."
4162,"Of course, it's easy for the WHO to lobby for vaccine delivery to lower income countries because it's easier to ship some vaccines over (paid for by other people) than actually support the development of clean water infrastructure or deal with the local in-country political ramifications of educating women and providing birth control."
4163,But that doesn't mean that the developed world should needlessly allow disease to spread in its population because keeping track of COVID vaccines delivered to countries that barely want them is deemed a priority.
4164,I'm cautiously optimistic about the rate of childhood vaccinations.
4165,"I'm sure it won't be anywhere near the rate of adults, but it seems lots of parents are still choosing to get their kids vaccinated."
4166,It helps when the vast majority of your population actually listens to what their government tells them to do.
4167,Not telling people to go get a booster doesn't help either.
4168,"Its the same wrong message they said in the beginning of last year in that ""immune compromised and elderly"" are only at risk."
4169,Everyone should be told to get a booster regardless of age or health.
4170,"I just told them that I am a teacher (which I am), without providing proof, and I was good to go."
4171,This was 6 weeks ago.
4172,On Wis Public Radio yesterday a host was interviewing a Journalist who did a story about PORTUGAL-which has 95% Vaxx rate.
4173,She asked him what life was like in Portugal today and he went on about gotta wear a mask everywhere and to go to a Soccer game have to prove Vaxxed.
4174,She failed to ask him if Hospitals were full or if people were still dying.....WOW!
4175,Worst interview ever!
4176,Stress can affect your cycle.
4177,Extreme exertion can too.
4178,It's related to the vaccine but not like y'all think.
4179,"Our bodies have the ability to say ""not right now, there's more important shit happening""."
4180,Like our immune system in overdrive creating antibodies.

4182,[deleted]
4183,Is this entirely bad news?
4184,"As a Democratic leaning voter, talk about vaccines has made me MORE likely to get them, including a flu shot."
4185,How much of the partisan gap is Democrats being more likely to get a flu shot?
4186,"12-19 days is what i read, or upvote jdorje's answer yesterday: https://old.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/qubdnb/daily_discussion_thread_november_15_2021/hktc438/"
4187,At some point ‚Äúit‚Äôs important to try to be able to look out for yourself‚Äù got warped into ‚Äúit‚Äôs a bad thing to look out for others.‚Äù
4188,If you are eligible for a booster get it as soon as you hit the 6 month mark.
4189,"I got one at Albertsons and I had to check off online that I qualify and when I got there they were like ""Do you have an appointment?"
4190,"Right on, wait over there please."""
4191,"how is this an ""anti vax"" thing when it's done by vaccinated people?"
4192,"&gt;The president of the local United Food and Commercial Workers union, B.J."
4193,"Motley, derided the settlement and $13,500 fine as a ‚Äúslap on the wrist for Smithfield and a deeply troubling betrayal of the men and women who have already sacrificed so much in this pandemic.‚Äù

I agree, that fine is laughable for a company of that size."
4194,"It‚Äôs not true that only masks stop new infections, they‚Äôre one tool we have to help prevent it, but vaccines are also effective in reducing infections."
4195,"What‚Äôs interesting to me about this restriction being lifted is, many younger kids aren‚Äôt vaccinated."
4196,None of them aside from study participants have even had time to get both shots since approval.
4197,"So, to me, it makes sense to keep requiring masks considering there are lots of kids under 12 at Disney, and we don‚Äôt want them infected nor do we want them to spread it once they return from their trip."
4198,That's really what everyone is doing at this point.
4199,I can‚Äôt seem to find this information anywhere.
4200,Does the booster shot‚Äôs full effectiveness follow the timeline as the 2nd shot?
4201,2 weeks?
4202,[removed]
4203,Their official name for this: The cost of doing business.
4204,"If the fine was, say 5 billion dollars then Amazon would maybe give shit."
4205,[removed]
4206,Exactly.
4207,I know people who are clearly eligible who aren't sure they're eligible so they're waiting.
4208,They just need to clarify that if you want a booster go get one.
4209,&gt;aren't the vast majority of antivaxxers in Michigan black and Hispanic?
4210,Uh no.
4211,Roughly half of all white Michigan residents are not yet vaccinated with at least one dose (assuming this is what you meant by antivaxxers.)
4212,Hispanics are also roughly half so are negligible for the purposes of proving you wrong.
4213,"About 62% of black MI residents are not yet vaccinated, however as a percentage of total state population, white residents account for \~75% of the population while black residents account for 14%, (with hispanics at \~5%.)"
4214,"I'll walk you through the math since you apparently couldn't be bothered to do it prior to making a hilariously false assumption that the ""vast majority"" of antivaxxers are black and Hispanic (which apparently are monolithic and can't possibly support trump according to you.)"
4215,.5 x 75 = 37.5% of the state population are white antivaxxers.
4216,.62 x 15 = 9.3% of the state population are black antivaxxers.
4217,"Technically, according to the states dashboard, about 25% of those reporting vaccine coverage did not list race so it's not quite correct to list these as a percentage of the total population, but it doesn't really affect the proportional make up of those not yet vaccinated so the point still stands: **The vast majority of anti-vaxxers in Michigan are not black and hispanic, they are white."
4218,"** And yes, they disproportionally self-identify as republicans according to KFF."
4219,"Germany's current wave looks more like a wall that is infinitely scaling up then a wave, sort of like India's wave back in May."
4220,"On the plus side, deaths haven't ramped up nearly as fast but still isn't a great sign."
4221,Especially when you consider Germany is only at like 67% fully vaxxed and has had low Covid exposure overall.
4222,"I'm aware of that, but it doesn't make our society any less wrong on the subject."
4223,Yeah... No.

4230,*
4231,Ah I see they decided to use the piggy bank for this one.
4232,People act like the rates have been exactly this high the entire pandemic.
4233,"Right now, if I get hit by a car and need intensive care, there isn't going to be any within hours of me."
4234,The country is on fire.
4235,"Even earlier this year, during the summer, the capacity was much greater all across the board and things were on the whole safer."
4236,[removed]
4237,"Well, it's exactly like I think."
4238,I missed my period in February as a result of my vaccine.
4239,I missed it again in May because of a surgery.
4240,I missed it again in November because of my booster.
4241,And March and June were total nightmare months.
4242,I understand exactly that stress messes with my cycle.
4243,I just don't understand why research refuses to even collect data on this regularly or just does super narrow studies.
4244,This isn't entirely true.
4245,"Like I said before, what determines the pot of money that these members are paid from depends on how they were activated."
4246,Largely the state manages the training and pay of Guard troops as opposed to the federal government.
4247,"Yes they still are paid from DFAS, but the account from which they are paid is often a state one that is conrtibuted to by the state and additionally subsidized by the federal budget."
4248,"Once the money is in that pot it ceases to be ""federal"" and becomes ""state""."
4249,That was my point.
4250,Got super boosted with Moderna and my flu shot on the same day!
4251,Honest question.
4252,"Considering large swaths of people will never get the vaccine, how long are you OK with getting boosters for COVID, and feeling like crap for several days after?"
4253,"Of course, I mean this is still a real world corporation."
4254,"As the article mentions ""the interests of the (company)"" is the first thing listed when talking about the complexities of striking the deal."
4255,"Mentioned last is ""the public health needs""."
4256,Lol YEP.
4257,"But the fact that they are giving this treatment out to those that need it the most (low income places) without making a profit is a huge positive I'd say, and somewhat shocking."
4258,"‚ÄúOf the 89 total infections, 87 people were fully vaccinated, the nursing home said‚Äù."
4259,"I know this doesn‚Äôt say if those 2 brought it in, but odds are low given these numbers."

4271,I got mine this past Thursday and didn't feel right until Sunday morning.

4286,Semantics‚Ä¶.
4287,Regardless it‚Äôs incredibly expensive.
4288,"Yes but you seem to be drawing conclusions and calling the NIH ""deceptive""."

4301,"&gt; This is a contradiction because the vaccine expiring means there's low demand due to no one taking it but you then claim we have no supply

*No*, vaccines expire because time moves forward and they don‚Äôt last forever."
4302,"There are many reasons why they may not be getting into peoples arms, none of which I‚Äôve made any claims about."
4303,Not only do vaccines expiring not require a surplus but to have a shortage *actually requires* demand.
4304,If no one wanted them then how would there be a shortage?
4305,Also I do not claim we have no supply.
4306,That‚Äôs just your own inference of what you think I mean.
4307,When I tell you it‚Äôs not what I mean you just ignore me.
4308,&gt; I'm asking you to provide evidence this is true.
4309,Because either we somehow aren't getting new vaccine shipments(indicating a supply issue) or it's expiring on shelves(indicating a demand one).
4310,"You‚Äôre asking me to provide evidence for your inference, not what I actually said."
4311,I‚Äôm not going to do that.
4312,My only claim to this is that ‚Äúlots of places are experiencing shortages‚Äù *not* that there will be mass shortages or no supplies or *any* of the other things you‚Äôre introducing into this discussion.
4313,So if you want me to provide evidence for what I actually said you still need to answer my questions because I‚Äôm not going to bother providing you with evidence only for you to start arguing over what ‚Äúlots‚Äù means.
4314,The AG should be relieved and there should be an article 32 proceeding.

4318,(We got married in 2020 and have been holding off our honeymoon in Japan until Covid subsided... we see how that went.)
4319,Hopefully travel restrictions will be lifted for vaccinated foreigners so we can visit and start planning our move.
4320,"For the record, this is how shit gets done in a collectivist society."

4329,That's never going to happen.
4330,those things have significant effects.
4331,The idea of giving them willy-nilly as a prophylactic seems like a bad idea but then I don't understand what dosage would do how much nor what time frame (taken as a prophylactic vs post covid).
4332,"It does, if I understand it correctly, which i very well may not,  mention a period of having at least a dose several days before to several days after but I don't see a breakdown in dosage period w/r to covid and efficacy"
4333,I read it.
4334,"The company I work for is spread all over the country, so by 2019 pretty much all my meetings were on WebEx anyway."
4335,Nearly nobody in my department actually works in my city.

4370,"However,

The problem here is that this is somewhat intentionally deceptive."
4371,We have massive data sets showing that children are less likely to suffer from severe cases of COVID-19 than older people.
4372,"That has not only never changed, we have far more data indicating it."
4373,There are certainly negative possible impacts on children from COVID.
4374,But we've have several years of data now.
4375,It is possible that there are impacts we won't find out until 10 or 20 years down the road.
4376,This has happened before.
4377,"But Delta is simply so infectious, that we can't prevent anyone from being exposed - we can only protect them through vaccination."
4378,There is no zero COVID scenario with Delta.
4379,"This paper, which seems to have been posted by you several times, is a bit of ""think of the children"" at worst and ""there are some children who have very negative outcomes from COVID"" at best."
4380,That is entirely true.

4484,"I work from home, but my wife sometimes works at their school and there's been a noticeable uptick in cases in our area (suburb in NJ about 15 miles outside of Manhattan)."
4485,"We're about eight months out from our 2nd dose... so per the CDC, we perhaps *shouldn't* get the booster thus taking a chance of getting it from our kids, maybe giving it to someone else's kids or WE get it and screw up this very delicate period for our own kids who have just three more weeks until their second shot?"
4486,"I mean... really, I thought they left all the ""qualifying"" behind because of the walls  known as Delta and drastically slower vaccine uptick."
4487,It's so damn absurd and needlessly complicated...
4488,Problem is people file for medical and religious exemptions which can make it dicier to fire them if they sue because they'll claim you violated the ADA in some way or that you violated their religious freedom.

4493,"Basically, they're doing two things at once right now:

* Testing how well a booster dose of the original vaccine works against Delta (and Beta)
* Testing how well a booster dose of a new Delta-specific vaccine works against Delta

The results so far seem to show that a booster of the original vaccine is working very well, possibly as well as the updated one is."
4494,So the difference in effectiveness may not be significant enough to switch.
4495,"Another point the article raises is that manufacturing is still a challenge, and switching over manufacturing could cause interruptions that reduce output, which could cause more problems than an updated vaccine would solve."

4500,Between flu shot and the Pfizer booster my October cycle skipped itself.
4501,I personally feel like some of the motivation behind not collecting data on this is that COVID deaths are a more pressing matter in the minds of those involved with the testing process.
4502,But I do also wonder if their hands may be tied by what they're permitted to do with the funds federally assigned to them.

4545,Then they'd be vulnerable to all of the viruses they got as kids!
4546,what fun!
4547,Because eugenics is demonstrably a horrible idea and then there's a question of who gets to make the test that decides who is and who isn't stupid.
4548,Traditionally tests like that are rigged to weigh heavily against certain people regardless of intelligence.

4598,*
4599,I have great doubts about this report.
4600,Yes a HEPA filter will remove nearly all the virus containing particles going through it.
4601,However you may be sitting close to an infected person and the HEPA filter obviously only has an effect on the air that actually goes through the HEPA filter.
4602,Most airplanes have HEPA filters.
4603,"However they usually are not  on when boarding/unboarding the plane,  and CO2 measurements in jetways during boarding suggest that there isn't enough ventilation there either."
4604,"A MERV13 filter, will remove perhaps about 1/2 of the virus containing particles but has less pressure drop so is compatible with most HVAC systems as built today."
4605,"A house, office, etc... could probably do a good job if it upgraded all the HVAC filters to MERV13s and supplemented this with portable floor units of HEPA filters in areas of concern."
4606,A good metric is to get at least 4 air changes per hour (ACH) calculated from the HEPA filter's listed CADR (Clean Air Delivery Rate) at a tolerable level of noise from the filters.
4607,Usually this is not the highest fan setting so be realistic.
4608,4 ACH will usually eliminate most airborne spread from people 2-3 meters (6 to 10 feet) apart.
4609,"If the room air is well mixed (which is usually not a perfect but not a terrible guestimate), each air change will reduce the virus in the air by about 68% (1-1/e) - but milage will vary slightly."
4610,\+1 for this.
4611,CVS does not give a crap about it.
4612,Got mine there yesterday and there was absolutely no checking to see if I actually qualify.
4613,"Had they checked, I would've just gone with ""I'm a few pounds overweight"" or ""I suffer from despression""  It's honestly hard to find something that *doesn't* cover like 70-80% of the population on the CDC's website."
4614,I‚Äôm not saying someone should sneak around infiltrating antivax rallies and slapping these patches onto people but I‚Äôm also not NOT saying it.

4620,HAHA OK... right... random comment with no legitimacy.
4621,"Point out what you don't understand and I will, in detail, explain it to you."
4622,Just for your reference since you are not understanding.

4625,this could be like antibiotics... turning a life threatening infection into something you take some pills for and you're feeling good in a couple days.
4626,I think in concert with the vaccine and hopefully tapering off social distancing and mask mandates we will be back to normal soon.
4627,That would probably be equivalent to a $50 fine.
4628,Not even a speeding ticket.

4697,I saw a friend post that she couldn‚Äôt find any vaccination openings til December 18th
4698,Looks like Germany has about 0.6% CFR - much better than the US but drastically worse than some other European countries (like the UK's &lt;0.2%).
4699,That's generally determined by the demographic spread of vaccinations.
4700,But deaths are actually increasing faster than cases.
4701,Cases have risen 4-fold and deaths already have done so as well even though nearly all of that 4-fold case increase was too recent to have killed people yet.
4702,So CFR may be rising (which is expected when cases rise).
4703,Another possibility though is that Germany is really fast at reporting deaths.
4704,The question is when it will end if there are not NPI's or additional vaccinations.

4749,"Good lord at the simplistic, self-aggrandizing logic."
4750,I wish I could read this.
4751,I‚Äôm not subscribing to The Atlantic though.
4752,"OK, so we'll need boosters, no big deal."
4753,"Well, cases were declining steadily until the last couple weeks, so it seems this could just be the start of an upward trend."
4754,I'm hoping you're right though.
4755,So you‚Äôre expecting folks to mask up every cold/flu season?
4756,That‚Äôs asinine.
4757,Define ‚Äúease up‚Äù.
4758,Granted I‚Äôm not a big crowds sort of person anyway but I‚Äôve been back to mostly normal things since I was fully vaccinated end of April.
4759,"A lot of my patients claim to have ""flu symptoms."""
4760,They have a normal temperature and are clearly not that sick.
4761,No.
4762,You don't have the flu.
4763,&gt; I don't think it should be assumed all antivax people are terrible.
4764,All?
4765,No.
4766,The vast majority?
4767,"Enough to comfortably say the statement ""antivaxxers are pieces of shit"" without added qualifiers?"
4768,Yes.
4769,Same with Japan.

4771,I'm referring to the 2nd portion of what you said.
4772,I'm not going to lie and say I've done a comparison between the positives and negatives throughout his career and I don't blame him for the problems within our scientific community.
4773,"However, he has lost credibility and 18 months of talking down to people has become a problem."
4774,"Sometimes when I try to put him aside in a disagreement, I can hit with legit clips and quotes of him where he looks terrible."
4775,"Lab leak stuff aside and his mistakes aside, we need a new representative for our fight against the pandemic."
4776,"Fair to disagree and I could be wrong, but I don't think him being the facts is positive anymore."
4777,"We also need to work on our entire structure for scientific funding and he gets blamed for that by some, but that's not on any small group of people."
4778,Someone needs to add a stickied comment to the top of the thread explaining the difference between % of population and % of eligible population.
4779,"She can not get the booster for a week or so, due to gettin the treatment of regeneron monowhatever they are, they say once you get that you can't get a booster for at least 90 days."
4780,Anyone??
4781,"My husband and I are triple vaccinated, mask, distance, only see other triple vaccinated people...and yet I am terrified of our 5 month old child getting this."
4782,"And if he does, what fault of it is his?"
4783,Society has failed a lot of people.
4784,Anyone who got vaccinated with the AZ.
4785,¬øWhat kind of side effects did you feel after every dose?
4786,I need to know.
4787,1st dose was swollen arm and neck stiffness nothing more.
4788,"2nd dose couple days ago and man, i feel like a shit, don't have a swollen arm but the headache, the tiredness and the groggy feeling around the neck and forehead is uncomfortable as hell."
4789,Anyone had symptoms like those?
4790,I did live in Japan pre-SARS.
4791,It would be exaggerated to say that masks were common.
4792,It would be more precise to say that they were accepted.
4793,"People would sometimes were masks in public places and nobody would think anything about it; whereas, you would be treated like an alien from outer space in most Western countries if you wore a mask pre-Covid."
4794,"In the West, it took courage to wear a mask in the early days of the pandemic"
4795,"It's been 7 months since my 2nd Moderna shot, any idea how much protection left?"
4796,30% or something?
4797,"I suppose I should get a booster, 2nd shot moderna kick my ass really good, I heard 3rd shot will be the same, how about pfizer booster for me?"
4798,other than less pain any pro/con changing to pfizer for booster shot?
4799,/r/ConfidentlyIncorrect
4800,Walgreens prompted me to get the flu shot at the same time actually.
4801,They didn‚Äôt require it but recommended it.
4802,"Not a first, but yeah, pretty damn important."
4803,I believe merck did the same a few weeks ago.
4804,"I believe the UN is involved, so that poorer countries have access."
4805,Rachel Maddow presented this info a few days ago.
4806,My wife‚Äôs doctor offered her Pfizer in office despite her getting Moderna during the initial rollout.
4807,"The doc said what mRNA booster you get isn‚Äôt important, it‚Äôs important you get the booster."
4808,People need to stop mixing up % of population and % of eligible population yesterday.
4809,Huge news
4810,"So, don‚Äôt get Pfizer vaccine"
4811,[removed]
4812,Well then parents with kids under four need to take precautions while the rest of us return to normal.
4813,Anyone here have their RGB or HCT go up after vaccination?
4814,"I get regular blood work done for medical reasons, and those two values have stayed immaculately consistent for years."
4815,After my second dose they both shot up out of range.
4816,"My diet is strict, I stay well hydrated, especially on blood work day."
4817,I don‚Äôt smoke or have apnea.
4818,Just curious if anyone else noticed something similar.
4819,"My doctor was baffled, all other blood work perfect."
4820,"‚ÄúAt a time when we need healthcare workers more than ever before, amid a harrowing worker shortage, the Biden Administration has prioritized this unlawful vaccine mandate over the healthcare of all Americans,‚Äù  Ken is completely ignoring the fact that the pandemic and the spread of the Coronovirus in clinical settings IS  prioritizing the healthcare of American."
4821,Not this bullshit.
4822,What a tool.
4823,Does anyone know the timeline on this?
4824,I already got mine because I was eligible for being overweight but my husband technically isn‚Äôt eligible.
4825,We got him an appointment for next week and I told him that if they ask to tell them he has depression.
4826,They didn‚Äôt ask me for any proof or anything when I got mine so it probably won‚Äôt even come up but if it‚Äôs just going to be like an extra week before he‚Äôs actually eligible we‚Äôll probably hold off.

4834,I had my Moderna booster yesterday.
4835,I feel better than I did after my second shot but worse than I did after my first.
4836,The main side effects I‚Äôm having are fatigue and arm soreness.
4837,Preliminary evidence of third shot waning too eh?
4838,Not the best.
4839,&gt; they are by-and-large not yet in school.
4840,"School, no."
4841,"Preschool and daycare, yes."
4842,Per https://nces.ed.gov/programs/coe/indicator/cfa 49% of 3-4 year olds were in preschool in 2019.
4843,Yeah that makes no sense.
4844,I wonder if Connecticut was getting complacent because of the high vaccination rate and low cases.
4845,There is no reason this should be happening now.

4853,"Federal employee here, this is just a diplomatic step as most agencies are finalizing their plans to call everyone back into the office to work vs being 100% remote."
4854,"So dropping the mask mandate, having the joke of a vaccinated mandate deadline coming up is all a work to get people back into the DC workspaces and transit systems that local leaders are leaning on the feds to do because $$ is down."
4855,Meanwhile the FDA expert committee voted 16-2 against the booster vaccine for the age group under 65.
4856,So how does that rhyme with the claim fauci makes here?
4857,"Also, J&amp;J becomes a two-dose vaccine, with the second dose administered at least two months after the first, and a Pfizer/BioNTech booster administered five months later."
4858,Same thing with my mom.
4859,She had to quit her job after that.
4860,Tried to go back but fatigue would overwhelm her very quickly.
4861,She‚Äôs still not working but hoping to find another nursing position where she won‚Äôt be on her feet all day.
4862,Really sucks your wife is dealing with that even being vaccinated.
4863,Has she gotten a booster yet?
4864,They have seen some improvements post-vaccination in about 50% of long haulers patients.
4865,Been in Munich the last 3 days and was checked every single time and they (at least looked like) they checked my name and DOB on my passport and vaccine card.
4866,In Banberg they just glanced that I had something like a vaccine card.
4867,We‚Äôll see about Berlin ü§∑
4868,"You are of course correct but people in the US, Europe, etc., are self-centred and will unfortunately never wear masks much."
4869,It's quite pathetic.
4870,I live in Illinois and the cases are slightly starting to go up although it's not as bad as it was last year
4871,Canada is at 75.089%.
4872,Japan just barely edged us out.

4886,I'm certain that they didn't.
4887,But they \*must\* be aware of the political significance of it.
4888,Which makes it a poor choice.

4912,That's basically my frustrating situation.

4936,"He said this recently:

&gt; I'm the head of an institute that actually played the major role in the development of the vaccines that have saved now millions of lives from COVID-19."
4937,I'm the director of the institute that has now been very important in the basic research in leading to the drugs that will now have an important impact in the treatment of COVID-19.
4938,"That's what I do

Obviously this sounds egocentric but‚Ä¶he‚Äôs right."
4939,The vaccines we have now (especially the *extremely* effective Moderna vaccine) would not have been possible without the VRC at the NIH as well as the billions and billions of dollars invested in research by NIAID in vaccine platform technology over the years.
4940,You said it yourself: anti-vaxx people will find a new excuse no matter what.
4941,"Maybe it might be good to find someone else to make the rounds on cable news shows (although with the amount of death threats Fauci‚Äôs been getting, I doubt anyone‚Äôs eager to take over that job)."

4996,"He rejected any safeguards and didn't even make it to his 1st dose, so his situation isn't really relevant to people who have now taken three shots."
4997,"It's not rejecting science to simply hope that at some point, either vaccines are more effective for longer, anti-virals are proven effective long-term, and/or for the majority of humans to become more and more immune through repeated infection, vaxxed or not."
4998,"I'll be going personally every 6 months until I know it's not necessary, and I haven't had a terrible reaction to any of them, but the booster was the worst I have felt out of the three."

5004,"If that thesis is right, I don't really see how we get around the problem right now without periodically stimulating the immune system to produce antibodies, unfortunately."

5016,Fun fact: Nobody is going to stop you.
5017,"Nobody is screening patients and going all ""Hmmm, I don't see any documentation saying you're eligible""."
5018,There are excess shots and the people giving out shots wants to give out as many shots as possible.
5019,"I walked right into a vaccination site, said ""Yeah, Pfizer booster"" and got it."
5020,Wasn't asked about eligibility at all.
5021,Guess your experience may vary depending on location.
5022,"I live in a small southern town, so demand is pretty low I assume."
5023,I‚Äôm guessing misstatement or misquote with the intended word being ‚Äúoutbreak‚Äù instead of pandemic.
5024,In other words the facility was scheduled for booster doses on November 2nd but the outbreak which began in late September and was ongoing on November 2nd forced the cancellation of the boosters.
5025,In the article they state that the booster event will be rescheduled once there have been no new cases for 2 weeks.
5026,Just in time for the holidays!
5027,"I have been, for nearly 2 years."
5028,I'm exhausted.
5029,My kid has never seen the inside of a store.

5031,I'm so sick of worrying that I'm bringing COVID home to her when I run an errand.
5032,That worry is only going to get worse if people can't be bothered to wear a mask indoors anymore because they got theirs.
5033,"3 zeros to 500,000 is 500,000,000."
5034,"While I agree I'd like it to be 4+, $500M in fines is definitely enough to get them to take notice."
5035,"there are two things that i can say about that, first hundred thousands of people were vaccinated like that without signals popping up and secondly after some hours all mrna is gone from your system, all that remains is your immune systems response."
5036,generally speaking long term side effects are not a thing for vaccines.
5037,if side effects occur they do so in the few weeks after the shot.
5038,if you wanna look at studies try to search in r/covid19 and search for heterologous https://old.reddit.com/r/COVID19/search?q=heterologous&amp;restrict_sr=on i dont have them all on top of my mind^ ^

5040,"I just got my booster, I was told when I got my second shot full immunization wouldn‚Äôt occur for another two weeks five or take."
5041,Is there a similar period for the booster shot?
5042,"Also if I got my second shot at the end of April, how weakened has my original vaccine become?"
5043,plenty of people still wearing masks indoors as well in NYC.
5044,I'll keep doing it as long as I still feel like being alive.

[https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/need-extra-precautions/people-with-medical-conditions.html](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/need-extra-precautions/people-with-medical-conditions.html)

&gt;As we are learning more about COVID-19 every day, this list does not include all medical conditions that place a person at higher risk of severe illness from COVID-19."
5066,"&gt;  
&gt;...  
&gt;  
&gt;Mental health conditions
&gt;
&gt; Having mood disorders, *including* depression

(I personally read this as the CDC has not compiled a comprehensive list of mood disorders that qualify, nor even a comprehensive list of *conditions* that qualify)

and from the CDC provided outlink on depression:

[https://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/topics/depression](https://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/topics/depression)

&gt;If you have been experiencing some of the following signs and symptoms most of the day, nearly every day, for at least two weeks, you may be suffering from depression:
&gt;
&gt; Persistent sad, anxious, or ‚Äúempty‚Äù mood
&gt;
&gt;...  
&gt;  
&gt;Not everyone who is depressed experiences every symptom."
5067,"Some people experience only a few symptoms

Other things to keep in mind:

&gt;Being a current **or former** cigarette smoker

What is a ""former"" smoker?"
5068,The CDC purposefully does not define this.
5069,These qualifiers are written *extremely* broadly.
5070,"I believe if a person can argue they qualify based on this, they qualify; it's not lying."
5071,Just my opinion...
5072,thats like half an hour profit on their rivian holding
5073,It‚Äôs not true that being vaccinated doesn‚Äôt stop spread.
5074,Vaccinated people are much less likely to get infected and if infected they are contagious for a much shorter period of time.
5075,A lot of these places people wear masks too.

5079,Oh I don't know seems like there's at least another 30% of the population that could get vaccinated.
5080,A large part of the problem is that a stupid portion of the population doesn't actually follow any recommended or even required solution.
5081,We don't know how they're doing because their statistics are not reliable.
5082,The numbers they put out are propaganda.

5085,"I'm guessing for a lot of those jobs, like nurses, waiter, cashier and what have you, the pay often isn't exactly great, so those people would be more likely to want to make a few extra bucks by donating blood?"
5086,"I mean if I were strapped for cash and I could make some money by donating blood (and if I were actually eligible for doing so, which I am not since I received a blood transfusion in 1985 which apparently makes me some sort of biological weapon), I'd consider that for sure!"

5091,I guess it really boils down to the greater acceptance of masks.
5092,I just wondered how masks can be effective in crowded public transport where people are squeezed together.

5173,&gt; The deal excludes some large countries that have suffered devastating coronavirus outbreaks.

5175,"&gt; Doctors Without Borders said it was ‚Äúdisheartened‚Äù that the Pfizer deal does not make the drug available to the entire world, noting that the agreement announced Tuesday also excludes countries including China, Argentina and Thailand."

5177,I've been back a handful of days.

5181,That being said I don't get the hate for video calls some people seem to have.
5182,"Nore do I see this ""zoom from office"" solution as bad."

5189,"Wearing a mask, especially as a customer, is a trivial inconvenience and it has been proven to prevent the spread of disease."
5190,"Being vaccinated saves lives, but doesn't prevent spread."
5191,One is not a substitute for the other.
5192,"Immune compromised individuals can't rely on herd immunity because not enough people are vaccinated, but containing the spread by wearing masks indoors can still help them."
5193,On top of that vaccines aren't 100% effective.
5194,Then add on that there are enough unvaccinated that we are still at risk of overflowing our ICU capacity if we have a big surge.
5195,"Removing mask mandates, even if vaccination requirements are in place (not that people don't lie about this) doesn't make any sense, especially as the holiday season approaches."
5196,Looking for a possible answer while I have been on hold for an hour with the clinic...
5197,I have my booster shot scheduled for tomorrow but my UTI just came back.
5198,Does anyone know if I should wait to get my UTI under control before I get my booster since my immune system is already activated?
5199,I am thinking I will have an even worse response to the Moderna shot due to the infection.
5200,I really want my booster!
5201,Is there any actual recommendation for *when* to get a booster?

5205,"Some reasons that come to mind:

- the CCP leadership can't agree on a change of policy,

- there is no populist pressure on political leaders who have to win the next election as in democratic countries,

- China tried to show that its system is superior to democratic systems by stamping out Covid."
5206,"Giving up the zero-Covid policy would destroy that narrative,

- a low infection rate means low immunity and the need for higher vaccination rate,

- the Chinese economy doesn't depend on foreign tourists like some Western countries."
5207,Business contacts for the goods trade can be managed electronically for some time.
5208,Really ?

5215,I still wanna get it.
5216,"&gt; In NYC we don‚Äôt have to wear masks indoors (except health care, schools and transit)

Someone correct me if I'm wrong but Maryland (maybe most of Maryland, IDK about all counties) has the same policy but without any proof of vaccination."
5217,"Some people mask, some don't."
5218,Mainly depends on the county/region.
5219,Relatively highly vaccinated state that has been doing pretty well.
5220,"I think a lot of people put too much stock into what masks themselves can do, and I say that as someone who still masks up everywhere."
5221,Masks as a NPI alone aren't going to shape the course of the pandemic.
5222,They are the cherry on top.
5223,Hence why it doesn't make sense (unless there is consensus in the population) to mandate such NPI perpetually.
5224,So that sounds like it‚Äôs both good news (Democrats more likely to get flu shots) and bad news (Republicans less likely to get flu shots).
5225,Or we‚Äôre seeing changing partisan identity: Those who get flu shots are increasingly identifying as Democrats and those who don‚Äôt as Republicans.

5370,No shit - Aaron Rodgers is a fucking moron.
5371,If you want a smart NFL players take on the pandemic - talk to Fitzpatrick.
5372,He got a fucking 48 (out of 50) on the wonderlic and graduated from Harvard.
5373,(Not the Ben Shapiro Harvaaaard though people!)
5374,Yeah I take a high dose pill because I‚Äôve had bleeding problems and so a massive headache led to finding out I was in danger of a stroke.
5375,I‚Äôm not getting the booster until I have the IUD and everything is kinda stable.
5376,I‚Äôve got a lot of friends who had a period missed after their second shot.
5377,[removed]
5378,It certainly isn‚Äôt just the unvaccinated right now.
5379,I think the breakthrough cases are climbing.
5380,"But yeah, that‚Äôs not the point he‚Äôs making."
5381,"I tried checking before pressing ‚Äúpost‚Äù, and I think the numbers on breakthroughs are not straightforward."
5382,Comparing rates of unvaccinated and vaccinated is misleading because the vaccinated population was vaccinated at different times and had different initial risk.
5383,But breakthroughs are happening.
5384,I got my booster yesterday at CVS.
5385,"They asked if I was immunocompromised, but I think that was only to determine if I would get a full third dose versus just the booster."
5386,Also asked to see my vaccine card.
5387,I brought my hospital badge but didn't need to show it.

5390,That just sounds like letting the perfect be the enemy of the good.
5391,Obviously perfect objectivity is impossible because that would require omniscience.
5392,"One journalist is limited to their perspective, but they can still report events as they see them without injecting personal beliefs."
5393,It's not rocket science.
5394,So I've just been incredibly lucky then
5395,"One week to protect yourself, two weeks to see a drop in positive tests/contagiousness if you were infected in the first week."
5396,For the purposes of public health it's the second one that matters.

5398,"As an American, there is something comforting in knowing that you're not the only one having to deal with too many idiots in your home nation.... and also absolutely terrifying."
5399,No one is diminishing anything and this is irrelevant to the point being made.
5400,People with long COVID still vote.
5401,[removed]
5402,You are vastly underestimating how many people won‚Äôt get the vaccine because of a fear of needles.
5403,As far as I know the blood bank uses needles too.

5406,"I'm all for getting vaxxed and stuff, but we on the left need to stop acting like everyone who doesn't have a vaccine is going to 1."
5407,Catch Covid and 2.
5408,Die/be hospitalized if they catch it.
5409,"Remember way back at the start of the pandemic when the fight was ""wear a mask, most people who catch Covid won't even have major symptoms and might not even know they had it but still be spreading it""."
5410,That hasn't changed.
5411,Most people (who are younger and in moderately decent health) are going to be just fine if they catch it.
5412,"When we keep beating our chests and screaming that ""YOU'RE 10X MORE LIKELY TO BE HOSPITALIZED!"""
5413,the people who are aware of the fact that it's probably not going to be a big deal if they catch it just shake their heads at us.
5414,It makes them take it even less seriously and view it as overblown.
5415,We should really focus on how it will end the pandemic quicker if everyone gets vaxed and how it's for the betterment of one's community to reduce the spread.
5416,Because most anti vaxers aren't bad people.
5417,They can see the value of helping their neighbor's.
5418,But they dig their heels in and roll their eyes when we act like they are gonna die if they don't get a vaccine.
5419,10x more likely of a low starting point isn't a huge number.
5420,Yeah.
5421,"I understand what you're saying, I just don't get how educated people can't see thru the bs."
5422,Like do I think the government always has our best interest at heart?
5423,No.
5424,Do I think there's some hidden Illuminati agenda behind covid and getting us vaccinated?
5425,Nope.
5426,Sometimes bad shit really happens and it's up to society and each individual to do their part to keep society functioning.
5427,"From the NYTimes vaccination rates, the fully vaccinated are around 70% of the population of at least that age."
5428,Sounds like Covid still has a lot of unvaccinated to burn through.
5429,Give him the ol' Kapernick treatment
5430,"It was distribution shortage, not supply shortage."
5431,They were sending out millions of doses because they were incredibly slow to scale up vaccination sites.
5432,I'm from Northern California.
5433,Used to reside 20ish miles away from Rodgers's home town of Chico.
5434,He's done so much good work for Northern California off the field.
5435,And he completely messed up everything with how he's embarrassed himself over the past couple of weeks with his asinine anti-vaccine nonsense.
5436,"He used to be my favorite player not on the 49ers, but now he's ""Throw Rogan"" to me."
5437,I mean the poster up above called him a dumb jock.
5438,"He‚Äôs not a dumb jock, he‚Äôs smarter than the poster above."
5439,Can anyone explain how they determine the rate among the vaccinated?
5440,"We know for sure that people can still contract covid after vaccination, but it seems like if you experience less symptoms after vaccination (and think of yourself as mostly immune) you are WAY less likely to get tested."
5441,"So absent regular testing, how do they know that unvaccinated are five times more likely to contract the disease than non vaccinated?"
5442,I‚Äôve been wondering about this for a while.
5443,[removed]

5449,"Assuming one is not rich, they are put on waiting lists, of course alcoholics needing new livera are not even accepted, because they'd again destroy it."
5450,Instead they give it to people who could have a decent life with it.
5451,"It sucks, but its due to the shortage."
5452,"It wouldnt be fair to a those who need it without having faults, of they had to die because the dude before them decided that drinking their liver into oblivion was a good idea, since transplants are free for all...

As always when you cannot save all, you are forced to make a choice, and blame all those not willing to mask up and social distance (or getting a vaccine) for this, but not doctors."
5453,I haven‚Äôt heard that one.
5454,I‚Äôll keep an eye out for news on that.
5455,News channels aren‚Äôt news channels they are advertisement channels.
5456,They will put whatever bullshit draws in media attention and sell it like hot cakes for ad retinue

5468,There was a good interview about his personal life that tried to touch in his rift with his family a few years ago but I can‚Äôt dig it out of Google with all his Covid controversy .
5469,So let‚Äôs just go with what we‚Äôve got here.
5470,"Watch Aaron‚Äôs ‚Äúapology‚Äù interview on Pat McAfee https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FGQ2fcaf70w 

And an interview where he has basic control of the narriative so he just tosses his opinions on while seeming like he‚Äôs down to earth https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZbjObpXCAfI

He tries to come off like he has a special understanding."
5471,The apology isn‚Äôt all that sincere.
5472,When directly questioned he deflects because the blame isn‚Äôt really on him and he won‚Äôt answer the question.
5473,"A lot of Aaron‚Äôs original central argument in the original interview was he had deeper understanding (like his 500 page paper to the NFL), deserves special treatment, didn‚Äôt do anything wrong, wants you to accept his understanding."
5474,Aaron obviously isn‚Äôt running a cult but compare some of this to Steve Hassan‚Äôs BITE model.

5699,It's legal
5700,"Mask are great but I have witnessed nearly 100% mask compliance (seen one person without one in about 4 months) here in Thailand and yet there was still a large outbreak and still is, and a lot of deaths."
5701,Definitely not that much of a solution.
5702,I am sure there are countless countries with high mask compliance and high care rates throughout the pandemic.
5703,"I would go as far as to say Japan is an outlier in this case, so not proof that masks are the main reason (not that you implied that, but still)."

5714,What a odd way to phrase that title.
5715,Germany‚Äôs top medical expert just said otherwise didn‚Äôt he?
5716,The issue seems to be we need the third dose more so than lack of coverage
5717,You don't have to be anything approaching a genius to just look at the stats coming out of covid vaccines and see that vaccination is *clearly* working pretty well.
5718,"Not perfectly, unfortunately, but well enough to at *least* keep the ICU's from overflowing, if people would take the fucking vax, &amp; boosters when necessary."
5719,If it has been several months then yes.
5720,Basically when your body sees the same pathogen again after a while it will create a much longer lasting protection than just a whole lot of pathogen at once.
5721,If your vaccine and infection were close together your body might have seen them as part of the same infection.
5722,The downtime between vaccine and booster (or infection) is important.

5729,I got mine in GA along with my family with no questions asked.
5730,All we had to do was show that it has been 6 months since our second dose.
5731,its an injectable bandaid
5732,Then nothing will happen.
5733,"Because for most of the (unvaccinated) population, Corona has no effect."
5734,They either don't get it in the first place or they don't suffer from getting it.
5735,Or to go with your example.
5736,"If the teacher only checks the homework of one person every other day, a lot of people will get through without the teacher noticing it."
5737,Which means they will be fine with not doing it.
5738,"Yes, take a bath in  B L E A C H."
5739,Do you have some context for that?
5740,This seems weirdly phrased.
5741,The smallpox vaccine was the very first vaccine which was ever available.
5742,Of course some people embraced it and some opposed it.
5743,"Those who embraced it ""saw it as a miracle and queued for hours"", the others didn't."
5744,I.e.
5745,do you have any evidence that the mandate actually induced or fueled the skepticism?
5746,There is still a need to know both cases AND hospitalization/death.
5747,Hospitalization is not the thing that spreads from person to person.
5748,"If my kid's school has 0 people hospitalized with Covid, does that tell me as much as knowing half the 2nd grade including teachers tested positive?"
5749,&gt; The antivax family wouldn‚Äôt even give their dog heartworm meds.
5750,"You just know they'd be all over horse dewormer for COVID, though."
5751,Idk if you know this but in certain health circles they advocate for drinking borax water too.
5752,So they prob would do this honestly.
5753,It‚Äôs... bizarre.
5754,"So the quarantined are now 21 days, they are only 10 days in England!"
5755,"That sucks, sorry."
5756,No reaction at all to any vaccine or booster.
5757,I think most people don't have reactions but they just don't bring it up.
5758,"Israel has seen several severe cases in under-60s after their third dose,  although the number is 20+ times lower than in the 2-dose vaccinated."
5759,No immune system is perfect.
5760,[deleted]
5761,"&gt; In the past the smallpox vaccination was mandatory

And that was the start of the anti-vax movement."
5762,Before that vaccines were seen as miracles that people would queue for hours to get.
5763,The Netherlands has a very small ICU capacity due to our more frequent use of euthanasia and hospice care.
5764,We simply cannot let all restrictions go without overflowing the healthcare sector.
5765,Training ICU personnel takes years unfortunately.
5766,I would not be surprised if we need to bring in nurses from elsewhere in the EU if we aren‚Äôt already
5767,As legitimate as Delete System 32.
5768,"That‚Äôs true, their vaccination rate could be better."
5769,Moreover scientists in Germany developed one of the best vaccines in the world
5770,It is actually more effective to mix and match vaccine types.
5771,I specifically chose moderna even though j and j was available in order to mix them.
5772,We don't have actual efficacy numbers on anything at this point.
5773,"At best we have real-world comparison showing positive tests and hospitalizations happening at a certain rate, but those are highly confounded by the different demographics that are vaccinated versus unvaccinated."
5774,"We know from phase 1's that a J&amp;J initial dose + Pfizer booster will be at least as good, and probably better than, the two-dose pfizer regimen."
5775,That regimen gives 80%+ initial-but-waning efficacy against infection and ~90% efficacy-that-doesn't-wane against hospitalization if infected.
5776,"We don't know if you'll want a third dose at some point, but after the most recent dose you'll definitely be in very good shape against transmitting Delta and far better shape against getting severely ill against it."
5777,I'm not that surprised.
5778,"Despite all the dumb partisan stuff at the start of the year, the Canadian federal government pretty much knocked it out of the park when it comes to vaccines."
5779,And *most* Canadians didnt hesitate to get them.
5780,The flu is brutal.
5781,I get the flu shot every year but still contract the flu once every few years.
5782,"The last time I had it, the majority of the worst symptoms were gone within 2-3 days (my fever broke after about 36 hours), but I wasn't back to normal for probably close to a month."
5783,Has any country actually started giving them out?
5784,I know a few have authorized Mercks but not seeing anyplace that is actually started prescribing so we can see real use data
5785,I don't know anyone with an infection.
5786,"My anecdote wins, right?"
5787,üòâ
5788,"Yeah, this seems to be misinformation."
5789,This was posted before.
5790,"The study this video is about says itself:

&gt; Clinical studies have indicated that patients with severe COVID‚Äì19 exhibit delayed and weak adaptive immune responses; however, the mechanism by which SARS‚ÄìCoV‚Äì2 impedes adaptive immunity remains unclear."
5791,"Here, by using an in vitro cell line, we report that the SARS‚ÄìCoV‚Äì2 spike protein significantly inhibits DNA damage repair, which is required for effective V(D)J recombination in adaptive immunity."
5792,"Mechanistically, we found that the spike protein localizes in the nucleus and inhibits DNA damage repair by impeding key DNA repair protein BRCA1 and 53BP1 recruitment to the damage site."
5793,"So, this is rather about people with severe Covid, which the vaccines protect against, and not a bashing of mrna vaccines."
5794,The jump to this conclusion seems disingenious.
5795,"Furthermore there seem more problems with this study, i link to this discussion:

https://old.reddit.com/r/COVID19/comments/qkq3qp/sarscov2_spike_impairs_dna_damage_repair_and/

I recommend reading the comment starting with:

&gt; TL;DR - the findings are of questionable physiological relevance since they use a completely irrelevant cell line (kidney cells), rather than using lymphocyte progenitors (immune cells that actually engage in VDJ recombination) and airway cell lines."
5796,Can I get a second booster lol üòÜ
5797,"Yes, it will last longer."
5798,Our body keeps blueprints for billions of antibodies on file for every pathogen we ever encountered and has to allocate resources between them.
5799,"most are one and done that we encounter once and never again so the body will ramp down production of ones it sees only once, however if the body recognizes something it has seen before but not for a while it knows that it is a persistent threat and makes extra antibodies for it that stick around longer."
5800,This is why boosters seem to work better if it has been a while since the original shot.
5801,By clicking the link you have contributed ad money toward the death of Americans.
5802,"Causing the death of Americans is *absurdly* profitable, and it is not likely to stop anytime soon."
5803,"https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2114255?query=featured_home Protection of BNT162b2 Vaccine Booster against Covid-19 in Israel 

there are pfizer+ pfizer booster numbers"
5804,I don't get that.
5805,There are less than twice as many vaccinated than unvaccinated here in Germany with roughly 65% fully vaccinated.
5806,"Even less, because that number does not include the ones not eligible yet."
5807,"That would imply, that the risk of vaccinated transmission is at best half as low as that of an unvaccinated person."
5808,Which can't be right by the numbers I have seen here in Baden W√ºrttemberg shared by the government until last week (they stopped reporting split incidences for vaccinated and unvaccinated people).
5809,They were at roughly 10% of the incidence of the unvaccinated people.
5810,"The only sense I can make here is that there are twice as many vaccinated people who can also infect the unvaccinated people, who then have 10 times higher rates of getting the disease."
5811,"But then again, the problem here is that they are not vaccinated, not that there is nearly twice as many with vaccine."
5812,And people keep thinking we have a monopoly on them in the US.
5813,"Nope, the crazies are everywhere."
5814,What a great way to get people to get vaccinated.
5815,"""Get your jab, get your certificate and then detox it away with this $100 bath."""
5816,"Start with defining ""the pandemic"" and work from there."
5817,"Create criteria for calling it ""ended."""
5818,"Whatever you end up with, the vaccine will be the number one largest contributor towards the ""ending"" of the pandemic, which ultimately means Covid still exists but isn't spreading around the world rapidly."
5819,"The vaccine reduces odds of infection and speeds recovery times, which are critical metrics."
5820,"But that‚Äôs exactly the point, people that are vaccinated, and especially young people are at practically zero risk and are bearing the brunt of the suffering of continuing this ‚Äúcovid world‚Äù and restrictions."
5821,"Lives and businesses have been destroyed, people missing out on years of high school and college."
5822,"Schools that have 100% vax rate still requiring nonstop, it‚Äôs madness."
5823,"In the US, Canada, and most of Europe,  we‚Äôre at a point where everyone has been able to get a vaccine (yes not young children, but they can now) for months now."
5824,The onus of protection and risk is now on them.
5825,smokers and alcoholics are already paying way more taxes due the % tax on cigarettes &amp; alcohol.
5826,"They actually make more money on them, than the threatening is gonna cost."
5827,"&amp;#x200B;

5830,"The climate is not similar, Japan is much lower latitude (35 degrees N latitude for Tokyo, 51 degrees N for London) and warmer than Europe."
5831,"Also, just look at recent temps, Tokyo average temperature in October was a pleasant mid-70's Fahrenheit, London was ~60F (the point at which you'd start using a heater), and other EU cities were even cooler, for example Frankfurt was ~mid 50's F in October."
5832,"Note that it would be hard to compare Japan Covid rates to any Western country anyway, as they never adopted mass testing during the pandemic."

5849,&gt;Importance  Short-term and long-term persistent postacute sequelae of COVID-19 (PASC) have not been systematically evaluated.
5850,"The incidence and evolution of PASC are dependent on time from infection, organ systems and tissue affected, vaccination status, variant of the virus, and geographic region."
5851,&gt;Objective  To estimate organ system‚Äìspecific frequency and evolution of PASC.
5852,"&gt;Evidence Review  PubMed (MEDLINE), Scopus, the World Health Organization Global Literature on Coronavirus Disease, and CoronaCentral databases were searched from December 2019 through March 2021."
5853,A total of 2100 studies were identified from databases and through cited references.
5854,Studies providing data on PASC in children and adults were included.
5855,The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses (PRISMA) guidelines for abstracting data were followed and performed independently by 2 reviewers.
5856,Quality was assessed using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale for cohort studies.
5857,"The main outcome was frequency of PASC diagnosed by (1) laboratory investigation, (2) radiologic pathology, and (3) clinical signs and symptoms."
5858,"PASC were classified by organ system, ie, neurologic; cardiovascular; respiratory; digestive; dermatologic; and ear, nose, and throat as well as mental health, constitutional symptoms, and functional mobility."
5859,"&gt;Findings  From a total of 2100 studies identified, 57 studies with 250‚ÄØ351 survivors of COVID-19 met inclusion criteria."
5860,"The mean (SD) age of survivors was 54.4 (8.9) years, 140‚ÄØ196 (56%) were male, and 197‚ÄØ777 (79%) were hospitalized during acute COVID-19."
5861,High-income countries contributed 45 studies (79%).
5862,"The median (IQR) proportion of COVID-19 survivors experiencing at least 1 PASC was 54.0% (45.0%-69.0%; 13 studies) at 1 month (short-term), 55.0% (34.8%-65.5%; 38 studies) at 2 to 5 months (intermediate-term), and 54.0% (31.0%-67.0%; 9 studies) at 6 or more months (long-term)."
5863,"Most prevalent pulmonary sequelae, neurologic disorders, mental health disorders, functional mobility impairments, and general and constitutional symptoms were chest imaging abnormality (median [IQR], 62.2% [45.8%-76.5%]), difficulty concentrating (median [IQR], 23.8% [20.4%-25.9%]), generalized anxiety disorder (median [IQR], 29.6% [14.0%-44.0%]), general functional impairments (median [IQR], 44.0% [23.4%-62.6%]), and fatigue or muscle weakness (median [IQR], 37.5% [25.4%-54.5%]), respectively."
5864,"Other frequently reported symptoms included cardiac, dermatologic, digestive, and ear, nose, and throat disorders."
5865,"&gt;Conclusions and Relevance  In this systematic review, more than half of COVID-19 survivors experienced PASC 6 months after recovery."
5866,"The most common PASC involved functional mobility impairments, pulmonary abnormalities, and mental health disorders."

5945,That amounts to just 0.21 percent of the nearly 38 million doses given to over 18 million people in the country by early November.
5946,"&gt;Most of those adverse events involved mild side effects like headache, nausea and sore arms."
5947,"The regulator, the Therapeutic Goods Administration, has received 288 reports of heart inflammation among people who received the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine, as well as 160 reported instances of a rare clotting complication linked to the AstraZeneca vaccine."
5948,"&gt;The regulator noted in a report last week that new illnesses or deaths within a few days or weeks of inoculation were ‚Äúoften coincidental, rather than being caused by the vaccine.‚Äù Nine deaths have been linked to Australia‚Äôs inoculation program, nearly all of them among people age 65 or older."
5949,"&gt;It is unclear how a few hundred recorded cases of adverse effects have led to 10,000 registrations of interest in the compensation program."
5950,"For the most part, Australia‚Äôs vaccination program has been a slow and then rapid success: After initial setbacks, an outbreak of the Delta variant pushed the country to move quickly to vaccinate its population."
5951,"&gt;The country‚Äôs two largest cities, Sydney and Melbourne, recently emerged from lengthy lockdowns, and case numbers have been declining nationwide to fewer than 1,500 per day."
5952,‚Äî Damien Cave
5953,What I had read was that targeting Delta isn't really fundamentally different than targeting original or Alpha variants.
5954,What makes Delta so much of an issue isn't that it has evolved in a way that makes the vaccine less effective.
5955,It's that Delta evolved to just deliver a huge viral load.
5956,This post appears to be about vaccines.

5959,*
5960,How will they actually verify that?
5961,"&gt; If it's expiring then that means you had too much

So if you had 10 dollars and spent 6 and something you want costs ten, can you afford it?"
5962,"It would seem you think so because you *had* 10, right?"
5963,Is it that you actually don‚Äôt understand this simple concept or just that you can‚Äôt admit you had a bad take?
5964,&gt; I haven't heard of any mass shortages.
5965,Given our conversation this doesn‚Äôt particularly vex me.
5966,thats awesome about your family!!!
5967,we have to wait til March for my son to turn five.
5968,CANNOT wait.
5969,"i still remember calling friends when rumors of a month long lockdown were floating around...and we were talking about things getting better in a few months

when my lil dude turns 5 it will have been 2 years since the March lockdown

hard to really absorb that fact."
5970,TWO???
5971,not just ONE?
5972,"when one seemed like a lifetime

ready to get back out there"
5973,I have the exact same experience.
5974,"Extremely consistent and predictable cycles for years (I‚Äôm 31, I know my body by now)."
5975,"Second pfizer shot and I got unexpected bleeding the next day, and my regular periods have been all over the place since."
5976,To be honest to the point I‚Äôm hesitant to get a booster shot.
5977,[removed]
5978,That is the biggest false dichotomy I've ever seen.
5979,If it's not over now it'll keep going forever?
5980,Says who?
5981,"You know things are changing everyday, right?"
5982,"If a house is on fire do you say ""if we don't go back and now we'll never go back in"" instead of letting the firefighters put out the fire?"
5983,HK also tries to implement zero covid strategy.
5984,I'd say many other things such as strict quarantine upon entering and mass testing and contact tracing helped.
5985,Just one more (third) dose.
5986,"mRNA &gt; vectored &gt; inactivated, but it's only a difference in degree."
5987,Uruguay ended the pandemic with 2 doses of inactivated and then a third dose of mostly pfizer; we know that these vaccines are all highly effective with multiple doses spread out over long enough.
5988,"I thought it wasn't an issue of shortage, they just need to verify that it's safe for everyone other than those who qualify."
5989,"Yes, but we absolutely should take a hint from asian countries and wear masks during cold and flu season as a basic courtesy if we think there's any chance we've been exposed and could be a carrier of the cold or flu as well."
5990,"Ideally we'd quarantine and stay at home, but sometimes that isn't an option."
5991,A mask always is.
5992,MIS-C is exceedingly rare.
5993,The hybrid model is mainly companies that could do remote but their C-Suite misses full buildings of people that all cater to them.
5994,They want their conference room full All Hands meetings and the catered lunches.
5995,Like my company wants to go to hybrid but require masks/6 feet social distancing.
5996,"At that point why even go back, if its not safe to do it without precautions you might as well stay remote and avoid adding the extra covid anxiety onto your employees."
5997,Fair enough.
5998,"I'm not saying have your children lick doorknobs, but my overall point was that I suspect many are unable to conduct a level-headed risk assessment based on data and statistics"
5999,It's only a small part of Germany that is tightening the rules.
6000,And the one which is currently hardest hit (surprise surprise if everything but the largest city has a vaccination rate below 50%).
6001,The rest of Germany is still hesitating.
6002,"The politicians promised, that now, with the high vaccination rates (science side note: it's not high, it's low), we do not need any restrictions no more... and did so just two months ago."
6003,But now they are forced to back-pedal as the numbers are exploding almost all over the country.
6004,So most politicians are now trying to find a way how they can safe face and blame someone else for their bad decisions.
6005,"They will probably discuss for another couple of days, so that the numbers climb even higher and they have better justification why restrictions, just like half a year ago, are necessary again."
6006,"&amp;#x200B;

thanks!"
6007,Thanks for reminding me.
6008,I knew there was another respiratory issue that was a serious issue among children but the name escaped me.
6009,"Look, if someone wants to make an argument that we should perpetually mask up children and distance them as long as things like RSV or the Flu exist as well, there's at least a consistency to the argument to debate."
6010,I just don't see hardly anyone having that consistency.
6011,A lot of folks talking up the dangers to children from COVID haven't exactly been on the forefront of RSV awareness in the past.
6012,"Sounds like a good ploy to get them to get vaxxed (you get vaxxed, you get a real card, ""but little to they know you've undone it"")."
6013,Moronic?
6014,Sure....but totally worth a shot...no pun intended

6026,People who have been vaccinated can still catch covid and spread it.
6027,[removed]
6028,"Yeah, unfortunately given the development of Delta and likely other resistant variants, any hope of herd immunity by vaccination directly/alone seems to be lost, but since we've accepted not living under lockdown conditions, a vaccine while lowers transmission rate substantially, lowers hospitalization substantially (10x) and prevents the vast majority of deaths is a powerful tool in getting us through this."
6029,Maybe via medications for treatment or new boosters to new variants we can get the population to a point where our communities are safe.
6030,"This won't be quick or easy, but it's encouraging to see how resilient those infected after vaccination or before vaccination seen to be to subsequent infection."
6031,Why are we allowing stupid people to breed.
6032,I'll bite.
6033,"I'm high risk so I'm obviously going to be doing it longer than many people, probably always at medical appointments and during dense travel scenarios."
6034,"But for the average person, there are many considerations."
6035,I hope you are a person that understands unvaccinated people are dangerous to community spread and that the vaccinated don't have full immunity but do have a reduced ability to spread.
6036,And maybe have some empathy for those of us who will always have to mask because you want to take yours off sooner.
6037,* What is community spread like?
6038,Looking to the hospitalizations and positivity rates and determining if you being unmasked will burden a system and take beds away from people with non-preventable illnesses.
6039,* What treatments exist?
6040,"Right now, we're on the cusp of another medical treatment and antibodies are a primary way to reduce danger, even to the vaccinated."
6041,"Without more treatments, we need to mask."
6042,* How are the vaccines holding up long-term?
6043,"In my area, October had 30% of hospitalizations from the vaccinated having more severe cases."
6044,"With the booster, this has already dropped almost 5 points."
6045,* Will unvaccinated people be present?
6046,"You shouldn't associate with them because you become a vector but since they do exist, they should always be masking."
6047,It should be mandatory.
6048,"And as long as it isn't, you should view them as the danger they are."
6049,* You should always mask if you are ill.
6050,Whether it's Covid or not.
6051,Ideally you wouldn't go in public but I recognize that will never happen.
6052,* Watch the animals.
6053,We're still learning what's going on there.
6054,"I'm watching deer season in my state to see if there's any weirdness, though I don't expect it."
6055,* Follow the science.
6056,Things change.
6057,You can't predict today what you'll do next month.
6058,I was okay with my husband taking off his mask indoors in May.
6059,"In June, Delta took out my state and he quickly put the mask back on without me even requesting it."
6060,In September my husband's brother died of Covid.
6061,So also follow the trauma and show understanding about masking around people who lost someone.
6062,* Maybe wait to make grand proclamations about how awful it is you still have to mask when people are dying in the numbers they have this year and in a post about case counts rising.
6063,The studies on efficacy and safety were done on those who were 18+.
6064,Boosters were found to be both safe and extremely effective.
6065,The issue the governing bodies had were 1) they weren't sure they were necessary and 2) they didn't want the optics of having the US get boosted while poorer countries were still waiting for their first shots (even though we're tossing out millions of doses weekly).
6066,"So they compromised and said ""well, anyone over a certain age and with certain conditions or who work in certain jobs can get boosted"" which essentially meant 80% of the over 18 population as long as they were 6 months out from their second shot."
6067,(Literally.
6068,Qualifying conditions include anxiety and depression at any age.)
6069,"And now states like California and Colorado are seeing huge surges and they're saying ""nah...boosters for everyone."""
6070,So everyone should just get boosted once they hit that 6 month mark.
6071,"They're safe, effective and don't we all have anxiety or depression at this point in the pandemic?"
6072,And I'm saying that as someone with two diagnosed anxiety disorders.
6073,Congress ultimately has the power of the purse.
6074,Its easy to stop up the spigot.
6075,"just out of curiosity , how many booster shots will you guys be getting."
6076,Is every 6 months the standard now?
6077,Agegroups play a role aswell.
6078,"Compared to UK Germany vaccinated more young people and fewer older people, which will further put hospitals under pressure."
6079,Austria is already setting up triage protocols.

6206,"The worker who killed the dog was dismissed and had to make an apology to the owner, and the story was covered in Chinese media."
6207,"On the other hand, when a Chinese doctor called the zero-CoVID strategy into question, there was a lot of public anger on social media directed at him."
6208,"Most people agree with the zero-CoVID policy, and it's not difficult to see why: China has been almost completely CoVID-free for more than a year-and-a-half, meaning that restaurants, bars and the like have been open."

6246,Not even 2 in 3 people are 2-dosers (much less fully vaccinated).
6247,"If we were talking about the UAE or Portugal or a place with vaccine passports, that might make sense."
6248,But DC isn't a highly vaccinated location.
6249,"My armpit in my shot arm was really sore and felt super swollen for about 3-4 days after my booster, it was my only side effect."
6250,I went on a run on day 3 or so and that really helped.
6251,I live in the south of the country and all hospitals around me are full.
6252,"'In order to be vaccinated at school, students must be accompanied by an adult and have consent from a guardian.'"
6253,"I guess they do have to follow the laws, but this still sucks - considering that anti-vaxxer parents do *not* have their children's best interest in mind."
6254,Did it hurt?
6255,my 2nd shot it was really bad.
6256,"Ah oops, the adults are 92%, kids aren't vaccinated.my bad"
6257,"Same, 2nd shot was really rough."
6258,"Maybe I'm just weird, but I don't like the idea of mixing shots."
6259,One of my buddies got a Pfizer booster and had 0 symptoms but she also didn't get wrecked from any of the Pfizer shots.
6260,"Idk if anyone mixed because the rough go of their 2nd jab, but I'm sure someone here has."
6261,Probably pretty similar effectiveness too.
6262,"I think my job would let me, but we're pretty busy right now."
6263,Maybe I will just have a lame weekend and get the shot on a Friday afternoon.
6264,"I'm still not in a rush to get it, but I have a pretty standard routine and am pretty safe."
6265,"I don't really want to get these every 6 months forever, but I suppose I will plan on it until we have better long term data."
6266,"Hopefully, T-cell response after the 3 I have gotten will at least tame any breakthroughs to where this can eventually transition to a yearly shot and if I get sick, it becomes progressively easier to deal with."
6267,I mean that and maintaining general health seems to be all we can do at this point.
6268,He doesn‚Äôt have diagnosed depression.
6269,He has diagnosed anxiety but I don‚Äôt think that counts.

6272,Their school district dropped the mask mandate Friday.
6273,üôÑ
6274,I have all 3 doses Pfizer because they were available first.
6275,We're not going to come to an agreement here and I don't want to take the time to argue it.
6276,I'm sure we've both heard it all.
6277,I'd rather disagree on Fauci as a representative of the scientific community and agree on the importance of trusting science and getting people vaccinated.
6278,I‚Äôve seen that theory but I wouldn‚Äôt know enough to be able to tell you anything.
6279,I find it very interesting but it also sounds like some conspiracy theory so I try to be careful with it.
6280,"One thing I do know is that we do much better with masks, and most of us wear it even outdoors where as most people in the west would take it off."
6281,Much less vaccine hesitancy among the public as well.
6282,"Also governments national, prefectural and municipal respects science (less religious influence) and base policies on it."
6283,Prefectural governments are in charge of COVID containment policies but they‚Äôre generally cooperative and face similar direction as opposed to American states where approaches vary drastically between D R divide.
6284,Osaka/Hyogo governors had some beef last year on COVID policies but even then their approaches were similar in direction and met successes in both prefectures.
6285,"In Kanto, led by the Tokyo governor Koike, other governors of the region cooperated well to handle the pandemic together."
6286,"Above are my observations, not saying they‚Äôre true necessarily, but what I take to be true and suspect to have contributed to Japan‚Äôs relative successes."
