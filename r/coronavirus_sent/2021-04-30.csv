0,Any false news about the vaccines should be deleted from every website.
1,Spreading this anti-vaxx propaganda is dangerous and will kill too many people.
2,It’s ok I know you can’t tell me who you work for
3,"Patient: ""Oh my God, I think I'm having a reaction to the vaccine."
4,"I feel dizzy, nauseous, and my chest hurts."""
5,"Nurse: ""Uh, we haven't given you the shot yet."""
6,"Patient: ""I'm gonna throw up..."
7,"I'm gonna pass out..."""
8,"I had dizziness, rapid heart rate, and tingling arms when I got my first shot and I was convinced I was having an allergic reaction."
9,"Nope, all anxiety."
10,"Doctor said I could have an ativan before dose two, and it made a world of difference."
11,"Maybe Belgium, but only till last summer"
12,Nice
13,"no, i have better things to do than argue with redditors"
14,How are they coming up with these guidelines and requirements before theres even a single FDA approved vaccine.
15,"Sure, but their own health minister confirmed a few months ago that around 81% of all excess deaths in the country are directly due to covid"
16,Yes!
17,More families and friends should be getting rid of their anti-vaxx friends.
18,Closing it down before it gets out of control is why Oregon has a lower death rate then elsewhere.
19,All of the hippy types I know finished getting vaccinated last week.
20,But the low death rate has not been impressive enough to motivate a lot of people.
21,(#FilmYourHospital is also popular in Oregon).
22,"&gt;When I say that airlines aren't going to trust this or any policy is going to stay in place, it's because it's very clear that nothing is set in stone."
23,"They might keep four months, they might not - a company relying on that at this point would be pretty dumb."
24,"They undoubtedly have already made decisions and plans for what will happen when the rule is repealed, because there's no reason to believe they'll have much forewarning (they had extremely little on masks being required, negative test being required, countries opening and closing borders, etc)."
25,"The TSA mask requirement was instituted at the direct request of the airline industry:  their staff were being abused by customers when enforcing their private mask mandates, and the federal rule gave it extra teeth."
26,"This rule simply codifies something that was likely to happen anyway in the private market, and the extension was almost certainly done because the airline industry asked for it."

35,What about the cruise ships?
36,Does federal law prevail there too?
37,Sounds like Friday to me.
38,We've required vaccinations for school entry for a very long time.
39,"Hell, the first law mandating them for school in the US was passed in 1827."
40,We should start forcing grocery stores to stop carrying unhealthy food then.
41,Obesity has killed far more than this virus ever will.

56,Go Romania 🇷🇴
57,They can’t.
58,Don’t think any of the mRNA are authorized in India.
59,You’re being downvoted but you’re right.
60,I just posted below about my nephew who caught it twice about 6 months apart.
61,The Reddit hive mind is clearly also part of the problem.
62,Have an upvote.
63,My college wanted vax records before covid to live on campus I thought most do.
64,K-12 do
65,It’s our way of thanking them for paying for the wall.
66,I’m sorry.
67,Downvote away
68,"Yeah that’s pretty much been my stance on it but these guys are holier-than-thou, take Joe Rogan’s word as fact, kinda guys lol."
69,So I’m leaning towards not even worth speaking on it.
70,"Let's just call these ""wait and see"" people what they are: anti-vaxxers"
71,"Yes, of course."
72,How could it be otherwise?
73,Probably not China but who knows at that border if some people are mixing.
74,It only takes a few.
75,I don't know.
76,When I got my first one they booked me for my second one on the way out.

86,"Well it would be great if that 25% would go get it cuz we only need around 70% for things to get back to normal so community transmission would go down 

And also, demand wouldn’t exactly be considered peaked if 25% have not yet made appointments or the time for it"
87,It is a race.
88,We will ultimately win when the number of infected goes so low that it doesn’t have enough opportunity to mutate.
89,One great news is that Covid mutates less frequently than influenza.
90,We have a high number of mutations now simply because of the high rate of infection.
91,[removed]
92,"Thanks, now I know which colleges to avoid."
93,The numbers simply tell a different story.
94,Dallas County is already open and has had four mortalities of 1.6 million vaccinated.
95,All four of them were severely compromised.
96,The numbers are showing by and large the vaccines to have a profound effect on COVID outcomes across the board.
97,Of course the right thing to do is to wait until a local population has vaccinated everyone planning on doing so.
98,"At which point, it's time to reopen."
99,That’s exactly what I thought last weekend while feeling like I got hit by a bus after the 2nd Moderna shot.
100,"""1-2 months""

Read much?"
101,"This link is full of errors and misses the entire point Geert makes, that vaccinating people who are likely to be exposed to the virus before the vaccine instantiates a full immune response puts selection pressure to escape that immune response."
102,It is akin to not finishing antibiotics.
103,oh right lol
104,"&gt;They aren't even capable of reporting the deaths

how do you know?"
105,Are you from India?
106,&gt;	There have been two recent studies that show the opposite.
107,Natural immunity from infection is proving to be similarly protective as is vaccination.
108,That may or may not be true but my 15 year old nephew caught Covid twice.
109,"He had it about 6 months ago, got sick again last week and then tested positive again on Friday."
110,The unfortunate truth is that we’re in uncharted territory here.
111,**Bottom line is that people need to get vaccinated.
112,** People who refuse to vaccinate are only perpetuating the situation.
113,"They’re giving the virus more opportunity to mutate, possibly making the few tools we have against it less effective."
114,Edit: Just to add that the doctors didn’t want to test him.
115,They told him he didn’t need it since he still had antibodies from the first infection.
116,He told them it felt exactly the same and demanded that they test him.
117,They were surprised to find that he did in fact have Covid…again.
118,I feel like this sort of information should be freely shared and behind zero pay wall considering this concerns literally everyone.
119,Just judging by the views outside the hospital I definitely believe otherwise.
120,But I certainly hope that people can somehow learn to be cautious and leave space for just this little bit in time before going back to the way they normally act
121,Everyone has their own tipping point.
122,Why would they not?
123,Health is what matters not loophole for the disadvantaged.
124,"Germany makes, the world takes."
125,California has a record - I just got mine from them today.
126,I’m guessing other states do too.
127,"California has one, I just got my records from it today."
128,Surely we can’t be the only state?
129,The person the GOP ran against Inslee in 2020 is a Trump level moron.
130,I don’t always agree with Inslee but he’s better than anyone the Republicans have put out in Washington
131,This is what fully vaccinated people should do: live their life.
132,Lol you make it sound like a jungle with people scrambling for a jab.
133,"Since vaccines are administered by healthcare and public health professionals, it's reasonable to expect those facilities to have stricter rules with masks and social distancing."
134,"I've seen footage of vaccine sites, and it doesn't seem all that different from vaccine sites here in the US."
135,"If you have the priveledge/desire to stay at home forever sure, do what you want.... but generally we all are hoping for a return to normalcy."
136,Vaccines are what makes that happen.

166,Like not even all the time.
167,Just in the middle of a one in a century pandemic.
168,it really is quite encouraging to see the numbers consistently dropping
169,Now imagine being me wearing behind the ear hearing aids on both ears and glasses along with mask string.
170,It’s awful but I’m okay with it as long as I’m free to move internationally again.
171,No he should have put a tldr for that ...it was a tldr for the one on top.
172,Aren't the current severe global disparities in vaccine supply *because* the high-income countries hoarded up a disproportionate quantity of doses once the early trials were successful?
173,"And the worst thing about all this is since India is the main supplier of vaccines for the low-and-middle-income countries in Africa, the global poor will be facing prolonged vaccine shortages when they need it the most."
174,Cool.
175,Now do Florida.
176,Yeah but does not mean we will be doing why we have been doing for the past year.
177,It will be like the yearly flu or some shit like that.
178,"Depending on the age of the kids, they may be less likely to spread covid if they’re younger than 10."
179,"Being outside helps lower transmission rates as well, so the kids would be in a lower risk environment compared to other activities."
180,"And that’s all *if* someone even happened to be infected with covid, which sounds pretty unlikely, given the adults are vaccinated and responsible."
181,It was hard for everyone to adjust to the covid guidelines and precautions.
182,"I remember just being in complete disbelief back in March 2020, and it took me a long, long time to start to feel “normal” wearing a mask, distancing, etc (if you can even call that normal)."
183,It’s going to take some time to start feeling comfortable retraining ourselves as the risk level of covid goes down.
184,Have fun at the BBQ!
185,"The first of many similar events, I hope!"
186,Tell them that blood clots are exceedingly rare.
187,"Even if you are low risk for death from Covid, that probability is far higher than the probability of dying from a vaccine induced blood clot."
188,Basically from a risk perspective the vaccine is a no-brainer.
189,Now if the guys you work with are idiots and can understand the above them I am not sure what you can say to them.

200,How are we gonna keep up with this virus and end this pandemic if so many new variants including the B.1.617 variant keep cropping up before vaccines for just the first variant have been fully distributed?
201,"At this rate, we’ll never get it under control."
202,A strain completely resistant to all vaccines is gonna pop up soon at this rate.
203,"If it gets me to Italy to finally celebrate my honeymoon, I’d wear anything at this point."
204,Data wise the rate of getting COVID after vaccination is still incredibly low.
205,Hence the spike is with people who are not full vaccinated.
206,"You should go ahead and celebrate, and pray/hope that other people continue to get vaccinated"
207,"My 5 year old son is naturally pretty anxious, but we've handled shots the same way and it's been great."
208,"Very matter of fact, with a focus on how much better it is to get a shot than to get sick."
209,His anxiety about getting sick may be part of why he is so on board with shots.
210,Every burp and gas bubble he feels he's nervous he's going to get sick and throw up.
211,"He often sneaks a Lego bin into his bed ""in case"" he has to throw up, even when he's feeling perfectly fine."
212,"So anything that can help keep him from getting sick, he's 100% on board with."
213,Hopefully that number grows substantially.
214,....but you are not a wait and see person anymore.
215,Got your vaccine a month ago.
216,Plenty of the wait and see people will get the vaccines but plenty claim to be wait and see but in fact have no interest in being vaccinated ever.
217,At least learn a little about the country you hate so much?
218,The densely populated poor areas are the first to be vaccinated.
219,They often get their own dedicated clinics with no appointments unlike the rest of India.

230,Type “Covid younger” in google news and it should pull up several articles of doctors or scientists talking about my first point above.

349,vaccinated today with AZ!
350,So happy.
351,Interesting.
352,What about previously infected individuals who received both doses?
353,What would their antibody titer look like?
354,Was it a vasovagal response or do you have chronically low bp?
355,I hope the next one is better for you!
356,Why would anyone skip?
357,What’s the thought process there?
358,"I'm kinda wishing i had waiting on AZ.... 

but.. Its what was availble and the younger gens will need MRNA.. soo.."
359,It’s by far the most tragic scenes seen so far in this pandemic.
360,I can’t even imagine the smell of bones being burnt around those crematoriums.
361,"I know people refer to the legality and technicality, but it’s mostly political and financial reasons."
362,"(1) people are choosing to not a wear mask out of selfishness, ignorance, and/or “legitimate” stance against science and (2) colleges need students."
363,"If students are required to have their covid-19 shot, this will not bode well for those who do not want the shot and make it an issue of their individual freedom."
364,We’ve seen this issue in the last few years about primary and secondary schools requiring school children be vaccinated where there had to be local ordinances and policies in place just to “enforce” health and safety.
365,"Unfortunately, that does not bode well for support in very conservative areas."
366,"FDA approval Is a factor, but it is the not the factor for every school."
367,The list of schools that area requiring vaccinated students probably have the capital and resources to withstand students dropping out or deferring admission.
368,"Meaning, these are likely to be very selective schools or have a high number of applicants."
369,There are schools that have laid off and minimized hours for many workers versus schools that did not lay off anyone and found work for employees whose responsibilities diminished due to the pandemic.
370,"I'm using the official mortality data from  [https://www.fedstat.ru/indicator/33556](https://www.fedstat.ru/indicator/33556) and it gives an excess mortality of about 300K, not 400K:

[https://www.youtu.be/watch?v=F9twcuaUGRE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F9twcuaUGRE)

Anyways, yes it is yet a too high excess compared to the 110K official figure."
371,France and Italy probably had slightly better reporting.
372,C'mon my guy.
373,It’s safe to say that you could multiply that number times two or 2.5 considering how people are dropping dead like flies here.
374,Life is mysterious and full of unknowns.
375,I really wonder what nicknames Eratosthenes had growing up.
376,Yup.
377,A wide swath of people have not realized how novel this disease is.
378,"It's called SARS just because it's physical attributes resemble that of the previous Coronavirus/SARS virus, but COVID itself is on it's way to obtaining a brand new classification: thrombotic viral fever."
379,"It's a new classification because we've never had an endemic disease like this in society's history, and we are just barely starting to understand *what it is* in the first place."
380,The narrative that the young are not adversely effected is going to change greatly over the next year.

386,"Further info here, this is the actual presentation put forward by Chile:

https://www.minsal.cl/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/20210416_ESTUDIO-EFECTIVIDAD-CORONAVAC.pdf

First of all, for context, many latin maerican countries are delaying the second dose by months, and the ETA for second doses keeps getting pushed further, so first-dose protection is EXTREMELY relevant here."
387,"My grandpa has gone without a second dose for 2 months already, and we have pretty much the best private health insurance you can buy here."
388,"With that out of the way, the presentation states, assuming a 14-day period after the second dose has already ppased, that there's an 80% rate for preventing death, 85% for preventing hospitalization and 67% for preventing symptomatic infection."
389,"Slide 13 shows the efectiveness for people with 1, and with 2 doses."
390,"The single-dose efectiveness against symptomatic infection is, again, 16%."
391,"For preventing hospitalization, 35.7%."
392,"For preventing an ICU stay, 42.7% and for preventing death, 40%."
393,"I can't stress enough that single-dose effectiveness in a place where doses are hard to get is critical, and Sinovac, in my honest opinion, doesn't go above a ""better than nothing"" in this area."
394,"Compared to AstraZeneca's vaccine, which is the second most abundant vaccine around here, and isn't an mRNA vaccine, the difference is quite straggering anyways."
395,"https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/971017/SP_PH__VE_report_20210317_CC_JLB.pdf

After about 21 days, the single dose infection prevention effectiveness of the AZ vaccine is around (hard to tell from the graph) 45%."
396,"After a month, it's up to around 60%."
397,"That's not too far from Sinovac's DOUBLE dose effectiveness, about ~7%."
398,"If I got any of this wrong, post a source and I'll correct it, it is not my intention to misinform"
399,Since the beginning I was especially worried about India.
400,It was mathematically impossible to have a soft ride with this f virus in their circumstances.
401,My heart is with all of them.
402,"They have a huge capacity to produce vaccines, but unfortunately that hasn’t prevented those horror movie scenes."
403,I hear you.
404,"I'm not anti Vax by any means, but any kind of new medication gives me mad anxiety."
405,"Antibiotics,  my Dr wanted me on antidepressants for chronic pain that I fought tooth and nail, vaccines."
406,I always fear ill have a reaction.
407,Drawing blood doesn't bother me.
408,I still get my vaccines....then sit for 3 days wondering if I'm experiencing a rare symptom cause my brain is dumb like that.
409,Must be some kind of weird sponsorship deal
410,"No, I wouldn't really say that."
411,A ship quarantine is foolproof.
412,No one is getting in or out of that ship for a set period of time.
413,"That is why it's effective, there is literally no risk for transmission."
414,A lockdown is not foolproof whatsoever.
415,"Most ""lockdowns"" still allow people to go outside for a walk or something, and even if not supposed to, they can talk to each other, and they can go out to get groceries."
416,"That's why a lockdown is much less effective, there's still movement and people are still mingling."
417,"Singaporean here; I'll admit we're better off than quite a few parts of the world but we are nowhere near ""best place""."
418,"Despite having minimal cases we still have gathering limits, curfews, and a mask mandate for everywhere, even outdoors."
419,Taiwanese and NZers are way freer than us currently in terms of what we can do in our own country.
420,I'd say the only good pointers are that we have a fairly steady vaccine rollout and have more relaxed border control compared to the rest of the Asia-Pacific region.

439,"Now I'm wearing masks in stores only because it's policy (and a symbol of compassion) - I'm not actually scared of COVID-19 at all anymore, really."

444,It was difficult for everyone to get a vaccine in Portland until last week.
445,"Then, it started getting easier to find open appointments."
446,I imagine there are many people currently between 1st shot and fully vaccinated.
447,“I heard reports that India is doing fine but you won’t see that in mainstream media” 👁👄👁
448,Not a tough call.
449,The people opposed to the vaccines are not correct and their opinions are not worth paying attention to because they are uninformed and/or based on false information.
450,"DPA was still in force making them satisfy their contractual commitment to the US, meaning that as soon as pfizer production exceeded what they had committed to the US they were free to satisfy their other contracts."
451,It’s literally a bunch of immature 18-22 year olds who think they can finally stick it to “the man”.
452,Another factor not helping the situation is that military members see no benefit gained from getting the vaccine in terms of restrictions placed on them.
453,"I got the vaccine, but still fell under the same “rules” as those who weren’t vaccinated (IE no outdoor dining, gym workouts, etc)."
454,They finally loosened restrictions for members who are vaccinated.
455,I could see this changing a lot of people’s minds with regards to getting vaccinated.
456,Oh God remembering the lines from the train station... everybody would have been infected twice.
457,Noped out of that one as soon as HCQ entered the comments.
458,[removed]
459,"Not sure on Data, but a Doc who came to my 15 min waiting time period after getting the shot said that Ibuprofen and Tylenol were fine."
460,"Per the Vaccine FAQ Part II:


*What are the current guidelines on NSAID use before and after vaccination?"
461,"Per CDC guidelines, it is not recommended that you stop taking any medications that you are currently on without first consulting with your physician."
462,"If you are taking NSAIDs daily for management of a chronic medical condition, you should not stop taking them before the COVID-19 vaccine without asking your physician."
463,"The CDC recommends not taking additional medications beyond your daily medication regimen, including NSAIDs or acetaminophen (Tylenol), before getting the COVID-19 vaccine."
464,"After getting the COVID-19 vaccine, the CDC does not have specific data or recommendations on whether NSAIDs or acetaminophen will reduce efficacy of the vaccine."
465,"However, the participants in the clinical trials for the vaccines were not told to avoid NSAIDs or acetaminophen after the vaccine, and there is not evidence suggesting that the vaccine was less efficacious in individuals that did take these medications."
466,"As such, unless you have a specific medical condition that prevents you from taking these drugs, most institutions recommend NSAIDs or acetaminophen for relief of side effects after receiving the COVID-19 vaccine."
467,*
468,I dunno - we're at a good start with dropping the requirements for masks outdoors for the fully vaccinated.
469,That gives me hope that mask-wearing is at the beginning of the end.
470,[removed]
471,I don't know many people who'd pay a few hundred bucks to avoid getting a free vaccine.
472,"And I'm fairly certain vial IDs get recorded with the vaccination data in the event something goes wrong with a batch and people need to be contacted, so fudged data will stick out if there's any reason to look into it, such as ""Why did we administer 130 doses from 13 vials for 100 scheduled appointments on April 30?"""

495,I fucking hate when people say this I'm afraid of needles and despite closing my eyes and not looking at any shot for the past 29 years I have felt EVERY SINGLE ONE.
496,Because people have fought against requiring vaccination to fly.
497,You can’t tell who is vaccinated and who is just being stupid just by looking.

669,Pfizer is actively seeking approval for their vaccine in young people (not sure exactly how low in age they’re reviewing rn).
670,And moderna is likely to follow shortly after.
671,"I think by August we may see approval for use in children, and maybe even have vaccine requirements imposed before entry back into school."
672,Edit: it’s 12 yrs and older Pfizer is trying to get approval for
673,"""Dr. Lewis gives a soft sell that sometimes works."
674,"A patient will say, “So are you going to give me the vaccine now?”

He has to respond, “I don’t have it here.” The patient shuts down."
675,"“Then I’m not going to take it."""
676,There may be something to be said for this.
677,"If we can get at least the J&amp;J shots in the doctors' offices (any of them but the J&amp;J would be the easiest to handle there), that may swing some of these more hesitant people who are being left behind to history."
678,"They are more likely to trust their doctor and staff, not some volunteer stranger in a big tent no matter what credentials that person has."
679,It won't win all of them.
680,"You'll still have the ones that are so fearful of whatever they are concerned about that they'll never get it, even if Jesus himself were administering it."

704,If a particular virulent strain develops over the coming years restrictions might be reimposed.
705,"Also I hear about regions of the UK with no virus deaths but there are equally regions that still have high death rates but we don’t want to hear about those places, however some of us live there."
706,My only advice is that you already have a very small amount of protection after the first week or two after the first dose.

727,I know people here in Portland who got Covid and all of them got it at people’s homes.
728,This closure of restaurants and gyms is just lame theater.
729,So wear masks forever?
730,If you’re requiring vaccines on a plane or at an event there’s literally no reason to wear a mask.
731,"The odds of someone getting sick and dying are the same as they were precovid in that situation, it’s just theater to wear a mask if everyone is vaccinated lol"

743,"But hey, you’re a kiddie troll, so maybe you can sit at your parents house in the basement wearing your underwear until you’re 40 and be a douche troll over the internet claiming that it’s the industries fault you can’t find work and that you’re the victim, Reddit will care."
744,I mean maybe there is some hope that with the obvious narcissistic traits you have that some company will be so completely desperate over the next decade of COVID recovery that they’ll pick your resume from the bottom of the pile at random and you’ll be saved to abuse your peers and assert your dominance.
745,But probably not.
746,That money you spent on school was just as poor a decision as your mother made not taking birth control for a month.
747,So good luck to you.
748,You can see the difference in scale between China and its factories versus western countries that can only send what they have in stock.
749,"A place like Ireland or Romania can send several hundred machines, but if you want ten or twenty thousand machines, China is the only place that can produce them for you in a quick amount of time."
750,"Better than in Germany, we're still vaccinating our 60+ population, even though we now have the biggest vaccine production site for mRNA in the world."
751,Ohh well...
752,"I would bring a couple, having fresh ones to swap out will be nice"
753,Actually objectively speaking these vaccine sites probably are superspreader events if held indoors and a lot of people are not wearing N95 masks.
754,"Even distanced 6 feet, a closed off area aka inside of a store can circulate the virus."
755,I know a lot of people who acquired the virus from vaccine sites as they were not wearing N95 masks.
756,"Initially they thought their symptoms were from the vaccine, but they went to testing sites and tested positive for COVID."

888,Do some research on PCR testing for covid and you will see the “positive” test technically don’t equal infection.
889,The PCR thresholds were set artificially high to make the test more sensitive.
890,This was done to ensure more positive test which equaled more government money for the labs and corporate hospitals.
891,"That is why so many people with positive test were asymptomatic, there were really not enough virus in their system to make them sick."
892,If you study microbiology and virology you would know that potential pathogenic virus and bacteria are on and in you all the time.

903,There is also still some risk of spreading the virus to vaccinated people or people who can’t get vaccinated yet.
904,"Maybe the result is the same in that the willingly unvaccinated group is protected, but I have a hard time seeing that being the main concern."

971,And the last study wasn't about you intentionally catching Covid but more if you already had Covid you're just as much protected as if you got vaccinated
972,Please look up the patent rights.
973,They are not giving shit.
974,"It's disgusting what they and the EU are doing, and also very stupid."
975,Allowing new Covid variants to emerge will make the vaccine formulas they are so obsessed over completely useless.
976,This should be the way forward with all vaccination rollout plans.
977,"Yes, there should be phases that prioritise the vulnerable and frontlines, but we should not be waiting on them to take their time to get vaccinated."
978,"The better plan is to set time limits for those who need it most, and if it passes that and you don't get your vaccine for whatever reason, then it should be a free for all."
979,We can't keep waiting around until the hesitant vulnerable all get vaccinated.
980,"They've made their beds, and it's time to move on and not waste time."
981,The time wasted persuading them to get vaccinated could have been spent on speeding up the general vaccinations.
982,Literally 3/4th of my family and friends in LA have received their 2nd doses.
983,The remaining 1/4 like my father and uncles are either lazy or don’t care.
984,"Even some of my most conservative relatives have gotten the vaccine, but the apathy of the final few is a real issue."
985,yeah .. its more like a deathcult is running the country.
986,Patent rights.
987,"India, along with the overwhelming majority of the world, wants to increase vaccinations, but the US and EU are literally blocking them"
988,Theirs was dumb..Ours is evil and greedy
989,By next you can can probably get both if you want.
990,Well tell them you understand their hesitancy for a vaccine Trump recently claimed to be the father of.
991,I guess this is only for those who get their shot(s) in Germany.
992,Registration is possible within 48 hours after the first shot.
993,"Of course China's pandemic-related deaths are probably under-reported, but they very publicly and strictly locked an entire region, the size of most countries, in their homes for over a month."
994,You don't think that's effective?

999,"Flu is particularly tricky to vaccinate against because it can mutate so drastically, due to re-assortment."
1000,"Luckily Covid does not do that, mutations are much more gradual, so our vaccines should remain effective."
1001,Great idea!
1002,"And it could use a handy catchphrase like:  

Together, let's scratch off Covid before it scratches off you."
1003,Why is this not downvoted to oblivion?
1004,The heck happened to this sub?
1005,You mean the guy who put a bomb in his shoe?
1006,He made a fool of himself?
1007,The poster you're responding to lives in Manitoba who are taking appointments for 50+ and vaccinating hotspots just like we are—all of the populous provinces are doing about the same.
1008,We're getting doses proportional to our population and BC is at 87.46% of vaccines administered against a national average of 89.4%.
1009,"Granted, they fucked the pooch with the pop-up clinics and that's completely fair game."

1013,Did Russia even have lockdowns?
1014,If they did it must have been short.
1015,I read an interview with a woman who lives there that said everything is open and most people never wear masks.
1016,Take a look at some Russian people on isntagram and look at their stories.
1017,It’s like covid doesnt exist for them.
1018,"The excess deaths for 2020 are indeed around 250k, but we already have data for January, February, and March of 2021, and the 400k number includes that."
1019,Using the 10-year average undercounts the excess deaths as Russia had a downward trend in total mortality.
1020,The 400k number takes this trend into account.
1021,[removed]
1022,How many people are going to get the vaccine &amp; just not tell their company so they can try to keep WFH going as long as possible?
1023,One would be irresponsible to not get the vaccine if you're eligible &amp; it's in stock.
1024,I predict that companies that don't want to keep WFH going forever will eventually set a deadline on showing proof of vaccination &amp; require employees to return after that point.
1025,Whether something like that will happen is anyone's guess.
1026,"It's already may and I still haven't processed march 2020 yet even though it's been about a year and 2 months lmao

At least we have the vaccine though"
1027,[removed]
1028,Frankly if they offered me a third shot today I'd go.
1029,I got enough problems without tacking on the long term consequences of Coronavirus.
1030,[removed]
1031,And what happens when people get blood clots and die from the AZ doses the US sends or they’re discovered to be tainted because of manufacturing issues.
1032,"Are the recipient countries going to say ok, we asked for the doses so we assumed the risks?"
1033,"No, they’re not, they gonna blame the US govt and make a whole PR circus out of it."
1034,"It’s damn if you do, damn if you don’t."
1035,So yes the US will take it’s time to first check the doses and then negotiate diplomatically with recipients before sending them.
1036,And also deal with whatever agreements they have w/ the drug companies about transferring the doses to a third country.
1037,Definitely not in the UK.
1038,"nopes ... google ""bezwada wilson"""
1039,"Or maybe it's a low cost, high impact strategy."
1040,The cost of wearing a mask for a few hours while in a airtight tube is a pretty minor inconvenience compared to the risk of a worst case outcome.
1041,It's not like their saying you have to lockdown for 14 days after a flight.
1042,"IMO we should all be wearing masks on all flights forever, should have been doing it years ago."
1043,Any idea how many germs are on a plane?
1044,"Might even help reduce the spread of the regular old flu, it's well documented that the flu start's in one area of the globe then slowly migrates to other regions as seasons change and then back again."
1045,"Forget about covid precautions, this should just be common sense."
1046,we elected a superspreader just like america did.
1047,ours is still here
1048,"I feel really bad for India right now...  :(

Unfortunately, what's happening right now is irrefutable evidence that there is no god."
1049,"(at least I sincerely hope that's the case, because the only alternative explanation is that there is a cruel god and he is allowing millions of Indians to suffer and/or die)"
1050,What kinda work do you do now?
1051,I feel like that’s a cool job with a cool name phlebotomist.
1052,This is false.
1053,"J&amp;J were unable to fulfill their original contractual fill and finish obligations to the EU, because the US reserved the right to invoke the DPA and confiscate any EU produced doses that would cross the US border."
1054,Honestly not surprised based on how the government AND the citizens failed to learn from the first wave.
1055,It's really really horrible here
1056,"The allergic reaction typically happens in the first 15 minutes, which is why clinics are supposed to monitor vaccine recipients."
1057,That's not to say it can't happen later.
1058,Follow up with a GP for sure.
1059,Wel duh it is the nation with the largest population together with China.
1060,Completely pointless how absolute numbers are thrown around when comparing countries.
1061,I stand corrected.
1062,India has a population of about 1.3 billion.
1063,Or 1 300 million people.
1064,14 million is a little over 1%.
1065,To put that in perspective.
1066,"Also, a model is just that: a model."
1067,It's an estimate derived from many other numbers.
1068,"India's sheer size, the lack of healthcare and social affordances, it's political situation and so make it so that nobody knows the actual number."
1069,Even the numbers of the 1918 pandemic in India are debated to this day.
1070,Deaths range between 12 and 18 million.
1071,"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/1918_flu_pandemic_in_India

It is argued by historians that the ravaging caused by the 1918 pandemic was a turning point for the freedom movement which led to independence in 1949."
1072,That's just to put the magnitude of a pandemic into perspective.
1073,"This pandemic will undoubtedly change India in due time, in more then one way."
1074,"One year into this, the world has barely seen the long term impact of this global pandemic."
1075,It really is still early days.
1076,The Delapharm plant doesn't produce the entire vaccine.
1077,It just does one step in the production process: mixing the mRNA with the lipids.
1078,"In other words, it gets the mRNA from Biontech to coat it with lipids it gets from Merck or Evonics, and then sends the mixture to another plant for fill and finish."
1079,"Delapharm is going to speed up vaccine production, but it's not possible to add the Delapharm capacity to the Biontech capacity since the mRNA first has to be produced by Biontech."
1080,"They should adjust the claim to ""until daily cases hit X""."
1081,"Calculating that value isn't easy and it may need to be changed, but there *is* a number of daily cases below which this becomes inefficient."
1082,"Ok, so i made the calculations and you are wrong too...

1088,Get this guy to Italy!
1089,Head fake.
1090,People are shopping for vaccines since they dont want to take Astra Zeneca due to the stupid-ass media talking about the 4 cases of blood clots rather than 1.5 million doses without issues.
1091,Sooo they will stop distribution of J and J until the AZ vaccine is used rather than sitting around.

1109,"Which is funny because these countries are pushing for mRNA IP waiver at WTO, but yet they don’t seem to trust it enough to agree to indemnity causes like the wealthy nations."

1135,What a vicious little fucker.
1136,How many died while tens of millions AZ doses were collecting dust in US warehouses?
1137,This is so sad to witness
1138,"Well since fill and finish capacity is very high in the EU, the drug substance (the actual vaccine liquid, not just one component) is all we need."
1139,Try silicone mask extenders.
1140,They go behind your head and you hook the ear loops around the ends of the mask extender rather than your ears.
1141,I wear a mask all day for work and those make a huge difference!
1142,What if they also make viagra?
1143,"There's a pretty huge difference between ""half of one important AZ drug substance during January"" and ""half of all AZ vaccines during Q1"""

1157,From Reuters: “Voting in the most recent local elections was largely completed before the scale of the new surge in infections became apparent.”
1158,"Someone responded to a thread ABOUT MEASURES IN INDIA with ""all this for a virus with a 99% survival rate..."" a day or two ago."
1159,"Especially grotesque comment given that India right now is the realization of what many of us feared and warned against--once healthcare collapse, the death toll must far exceed 1% of those infected."
1160,They have 30 and 40 year olds dying who probably would have recovered in the vast majority of cases if they had oxygen.

1167,"&gt;The Americans just keep on giving eh

Is this ironically?"
1168,Don't get me wrong I praise any country sharing its leftovers.
1169,US barely gave anything in comparison to other countries or unions.
1170,US is basically still full on vaccine nationalism.
1171,"With all those cases, what is the likelihood of new variants appearing that have mutated from mutations?"
1172,Why are these mutations more virulent than the original virus?
1173,At the start of the pandemic we were told that mutations tend to be less harmful.
1174,"There’s so many questions that are left unanswered, I feel like I’m losing my mind at times worrying about the future of this planet."
1175,They basically won't believe foreign press.

1177,Educate them.
1178,Vote him out in 2024
1179,No he wont
1180,Any problem a person would have years down the road would be hard to track to a vaccine.
1181,This person has natural immunity and not the type of person you need to convince.
1182,Small chance of developing superpowers.
1183,You're thinking of Bhutan
1184,This is what's going to cause major disruptions.
1185,"People flying to FL are going to be like ""there's no mask mandate"" and they'll refuse to wear one on the plane going down there."
1186,[removed]
1187,The science supports the effectiveness of vaccines against the variants.
1188,"Moderna and other companies, probably, are also working on a third booster against the variants."
1189,Vaccinated folks are down to a level of risk we as a society didn't worry about before the pandemic.
1190,Oh ok. What kind of dipshit downvotes my comment asking a genuine question?
1191,Lol
1192,[deleted]
1193,"This is interesting, because I have always felt like my wife and I had Covid early 2020."
1194,Like really early before mass testing.
1195,"First Phizer shot kicked both of our asses, and the second shot was no big deal."
1196,I wonder if there is any correlation to which vaccine shot you have an immune response to and whether you’ve been infected previously?
1197,"My first shot laid me out for a day or two, nothing serious just achy and tired."
1198,Second shot was a cake walk.
1199,Most people I’ve talked to say the 2nd shot laid them out so 🤷🏻‍♂️
1200,"no they haven't, most of 65+ have had their first dose though."
1201,The vaccines are so effective that even a small loss of effectiveness against these variants still means they're very effective.
1202,4600 was a lot when this number was reported.
1203,That was a time when any other countries only see occasional cases.
1204,It's already more than the numver of people died in SARS or MERS.
1205,Obviously it's under counting but if it's a cover up why did they still disclose such a high number at the moment?
1206,People don't understand that exponential growth can turn something that is manageable to something that's out of control.
1207,The implications of exponential growth should really be stressed to math students.
1208,Many people seem to have a very weak grasp of this concept.
1209,When do yous think things will return to normal?
1210,"A couple of months 

B winter 

C 2022 

D never"
1211,Vaccination hesitancy is a big deal for me.
1212,Strategizing how to overcome it should be a top priority.
1213,"Frankly at this point I don't care, those of us who got vaccinated should be able to continue as normal."
1214,"If people don't want the vaccine and get sick, it's on them, like every other vaccinated disease we've had."
1215,"You take the risk, you reap the consequences, that should be their right to choose that option."
1216,I agree just say if 70% of you are vaccinated ALL restrictions are lifted appointments would fill up fast.
1217,[deleted]
1218,The vaccines are so effective that being somewhat less effective against the variants still means that they are very effective.
1219,"The vaccine is a small part of the COVID virus, much, much, much less dangerous than the virus itself."
1220,"Eventually, everyone is going to be exposed to the virus."
1221,"The question is, would you like your kids protected first?"
1222,Wasn’t stating a counter argument so much as an alternative.
1223,If anything we've over estimated it.
1224,That's not at all what my comment represents.
1225,I still think the mask mandate is important and should be extended.
1226,We're not out of the woods yet.
1227,"There's a good deal of evidence that we might be well before mid September, though."
1228,You’re correct at least in America.
1229,Lockdowns don’t work we need 50% of the population to work so the other half can WFH.
1230,The supply chain and general infrastructure can’t support its self.
1231,The Midwest where manufacturing and distribution pay most of the bills has been lost in all of this.
1232,There was no hunker down here just life as normal while wearing a mask.
1233,"It didn't say what actually harmed the child though, didn't read anything other than the beliefe of the parent."
1234,A child don't get more harmed by the virus because of beliefs.
1235,Fear of education is strong and fucking stupid.
1236,Good luck.
1237,read something that said people who’ve had already covid tend to only get side effects after the first dose and are fine after the second—any truth to this?
1238,"You’re right, I’m getting a test this morning."
1239,I work with kids in a school as a speech pathologist so I hope it’s just a cold but better to be safe than sorry
1240,India will mark up the prices and profit from this I guarantee it.
1241,"Let's all day what we are thinking:

1242,I will not react on the irrelevant points you replied to me.
1243,I just pointed out that they are one of the major proponents of vaccine inequality today.
1244,I don't know why you bring out a way different kind of topic from what I commented.
1245,"Per the [CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccinesafety/ensuringsafety/monitoring/vaers/index.html), the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) is used to collect reports of adverse events after vaccination from the general public."
1246,This is primarily used to identify potential topics to further investigate with regards to vaccine reactions.
1247,"However, because the event data in VAERS is often not verified and is often self-reported, it should not be assumed that the adverse events in VAERS are actually associated with or cause by the vaccines, nor is it possible to estimate the frequency of these adverse events from these data."
1248,"*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically."

1251,VAERS reports can be made by anyone for any reason without any proof or documentation from a medical professional.
1252,"It’s an important system, but by its design must be taken with huge grains of salt."
1253,"To illustrate the point that caution must be exercised when interpreting VAERS data, anesthesiologist James Laidler, MD, submitted a claim to the system in 2004 after he got his annual influenza vaccine."
1254,"He reported that his muscles began to grow in size, his skin became green, and he turned into the Incredible Hulk."

1279,The fact that it's now May 2021 is mind boggling.
1280,"A couple things:

1."
1281,"That article was written in January; four months have gone by with millions vaccinated, and there has been no follow-up study from these guys."
1282,"If they went looking for long-term side effects, they haven't found them yet."
1283,2.
1284,It states that there *may* be consequences just from coming into contact with the spike protein itself.
1285,"Meaning that your options, realistically, are to come into contact with the spike protein via one dose of a vaccine, or by a sustained infection from covid itself."
1286,"""Never come into contact with the spike protein"" is probably not a viable option, so the vaccine is looking pretty good IMO."
1287,"I got J&amp;J about four weeks ago, and while it was unpleasant, I have no regrets."
1288,"These are the best two trackers I've seen:

https://www.ft.com/content/a2901ce8-5eb7-4633-b89c-cbdf5b386938

You can see that for developing countries which record excess deaths, the official COVID-19 death toll is almost always a massive undercount, with the real excess deaths being several times as high."
1289,If you're that worried about J&amp;J and have access to Moderna/Pfizer... just deal with the needles.
1290,It takes like 2 seconds to get the shot and you don't even know its happening.

1293,Go now to make treatment easier and the way you're feeling more bearable.
1294,Call an ambulance and give them a heads up first.
1295,They're likely all vaccinated and will keep you safe.
1296,I don't understand how they can require this for a vaccine that hasn't been officially approved by the FDA.
1297,"They are still in the EUA phase, right?"
1298,Is it legal to do this?

1309,I know two of the sweetest people as short and round as meatballs (one with lung problems one with gout) who believe that because they have had bad reactions in the past to vaccines that they should hold off.
1310,They were convinced by friends who made it through Covid that it’s not so bad.
1311,So are you suggesting we outlaw murder?
1312,I agree with you.
1313,You’re really bad at this.

1317,You got a pretty big set of ball to make a claim like that.
1318,Until it mutates again because 30% won’t vaccinate.
1319,"God, why do people keep ignoring that part?"
1320,And it’s constantly mutating to be more contagious.
1321,And mild cases result in crippling lung injuries too.
1322,"I see you don't have kids, because children stop teeth after 1.5."
1323,And yes I have many memories from the age of 2.

1337,I hope that half of the holdouts have had Covid.
1338,If so we may see a really sharp drop as we hit a higher % than we thought we were dealing with.
1339,They refer to the lung injuries as scarring.
1340,Scars by definition don’t heal.
1341,"""Blood clot spots""?"
1342,Not sure that is a thing.
1343,Blood clots affect your circulatory system and you can't see them.
1344,"Also the blood clots from the vaccine have occurred in people 7-14 days after the shots, not immediately."
1345,"If you're worried, call a doctor."
1346,"But if you google the symptoms of blood clots which are things like severe headaches, difficulty breathing, weakness in one side of your body, etc."
1347,They are very severe.

1350,Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) if you have any questions or concerns.
1351,*
1352,"Because if one is vaccinated, the pandemic is over."
1353,That's the point.
1354,We preach about the science...the science worked and now we need get back to real life.
1355,They probably do regret it but when a lot of the summer events were cancelled or rescheduled there was still so much uncertainty about when and how fast we would improve.
1356,Hard to plan something under those conditions.
1357,There multi billionaires that literally wear gold crowns.
1358,That have way more to give than we ever could.

1362,Imagine grown adults spending time on Reddit groups talking about children's wrestling.
1363,SMH
1364,Get this paywall shit outta here
1365,True.
1366,AZ doesn’t have the same 2$/shot cost everywhere.
1367,Now I'm confused.
1368,I recently saw an article that they vaccinated 65% of the population in 1 week
1369,"Probably this like many other adenovirus infections enterovirus infections etc., Where people have enough immunity to keep it mild and will spread it asymptomatically to others as immunity wears down."
1370,For most this will be nothing more than a mild infection from here on out I'm guessing including variants.
1371,But only time will tell for sure
1372,So why are we even discussing India's official numbers then?
1373,"Hey, in Australia the current timeline for me (healthy mid 20s) is some point in 2023"
1374,Well said!
1375,Prayer is useless.
1376,The biggest lie we tell ourselves is that politicians have any control over any of this
1377,[removed]
1378,"But if you are vaccinated, it doesn't matter what others have done or or not done."
1379,"You may not know this, but when a word has an s at the end, it's generally accepted to be plural."
1380,"In other words, greater than or equal to two."
1381,"Most people with a reasonable grasp of the English language would even think that someone talking about ""months"" in this context is referring to *several* months."
1382,"This could be 3, 4, 5, or even 10+ months."
1383,One to two does not qualify.
1384,"The fact of the matter is, there has *never* been a vaccine side effect which was not observed until months later."
1385,"This is obviously in reference to the population level, and not the individual level."
1386,"There will of course always be that rare, one in a billion individual who develops symptoms later."
1387,"But at the population level, side effects are *always* seen within the first few days to weeks."
1388,"Th issue is not NOW, it's September."
1389,Do we still need masks in 4 months?
1390,It's not that alarming.
1391,Something like 75% of Los Angeles county probably has immunity between natural infection and vaccination.
1392,This was widely expected and this is why the vaccination campaign was expected to really be over by mid May in the u.s.
1393,"It’s a country of nearly 1.4 billion, with a significant amount of the population living in poverty and in cramped living conditions."
1394,"India was always going to get a second wave, the country and government just did a poor job preparing for the second wave."
1395,I understand the parallel argument but I find it strange when I think through a basic understanding of Covid vs an mRNA vaccine for instance.
1396,The spike protein is covid’s key into your body’s house.
1397,"The vaccine is like you putting the key in the lock and then there’s no one there to turn it, come in, mess with your crap, and do lord knows what."
1398,Wild type Covid is like a junkie showing up with that same key.
1399,Once they are in they will do lord knows what.
1400,Aside from initial reactions I can’t for the life of me think through any long term (that aren’t early onset) impacts from a vaccine not platformed on  a live weakened virus.
1401,The statement is non-responsive.
1402,Sure thanks
1403,How is the situation in USA like?
1404,Have vaccines been successful in reducing the severity of infection?
1405,Not been able to follow much because of the shitstorm we have going on here in India?
1406,It's totally a good thing.
1407,I'm surprised at how many comments so far think this article is fear mongering.
1408,I see this as great news and a justification/call to young people to get vaccinated.
1409,"It takes 10-14 days for the vaccine to help, so no it’s too late."
1410,"Your friend should stay home, get tested and get vaccinated as soon as he’s in the clear"
1411,"I'm no expert and I guess it's impossible to tease out the various factors that affect Rt, but the fact that spring temps are similar to fall temps, but in the fall we were on an exponential growth, suggests to me that vaccinations is the controlling factor here, not warmer weather."
1412,"Also many states had a fourth ""surge"" in March as the weather was getting warmer."
1413,All this makes me think temps play a minor role.
1414,"The UK has limited AZ to 30+, and it may be limited to 40+ if the vaccine committee believes it to be necessary."
1415,My gym has been open for months we all wear masks.
1416,No cases
1417,I'm pretty sure math is mandatory in all curriculums.
1418,"Also, after zero doses of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine, people with a prior COVID-19 infection had antibody levels similar to those of people without prior infection after two vaccine doses."
1419,Weird how that works.
1420,My 5g bionic laser eye says different.
1421,We are at the half way point in terms of vaccinations in the U.S of what we need for herd immunity.
1422,"And as I’ve said, hypothetical."
1423,You’re coming up with doom scenarios and working yourself up.
1424,"His takes are generally not great, and he gives platforms to people who have even worse takes."
1425,That's very recent.
1426,"The dominant strain in the recent Michigan outbreak, which caused all these hospitalizations, was the UK variant."
1427,Supply &gt; demand now almost everywhere in USA.
1428,Everyone over 16 who wants to get the vaccine can.
1429,"I mean if anyone has been paying attention to more than just black &amp; white stats, there were several ""younger people are in the hospital with Covid"" news stories last March, too."
1430,"I do agree that we are seeing a % of ICU population shift in the hospital by age, but that should be expected based on vaccination intake by age group."
1431,"So while YES, Covid remains ""capable"" of hospitalizing patients of any age, it still doesn't seem proven to be related to a viral change beyond increased transmissibility we've seen from VOCs."
1432,It's really strange how time works.
1433,Some periods throughout the pandemic felt like an eternity.
1434,I'm thinking back on October and that feels like a million years ago.
1435,And yet...it somehow *also* feels like we blinked and a year passed right by
1436,Anyone can die from covid but not everyone can make vaccines.
1437,America has domestic production whereas we're reliant on others supplying it for us.
1438,So yes we can compare covid deaths with the state's but vaccine rollout is not a fair comparison.
1439,I don't think they are only seeing younger people now.
1440,There was a spat of articles last spring reporting that X% of patients are under the age of 45/55/60.
1441,Where X was usually smaller than the relevant share of the population but not trivially low (e.g.
1442,[https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/18/health/coronavirus-young-people.html](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/18/health/coronavirus-young-people.html)).
1443,"I think it is important to know if variants impact young people harder than the virus did last year, but I don't think we can do that based on a doctor saying they're seeing more young patients without more information."
1444,Are they seeing more young people because they are seeing less old people who have largely been vaccinated and are noting a change in ratio?
1445,Are they seeing more young people because there are more cases and as a result more hospitalizations in their area?
1446,As case counts and hospital census decrease are more younger people being admitted who would previously have been told to recuperate at home?
1447,Is a young infected person now more likely to be hospitalized then they were in the past?
1448,I have no way of telling from the information presented.
1449,Yes it has.
1450,B.1.617 and the South African variant are both more resistant to vaccines.
1451,"Slightly, but that’s how these things start."
1452,Slightly.
1453,"And as I’ve already said, if it’s not sterilizing immunity, there’s a risk for life long disability."
1454,So two things.
1455,"First, saying it’s “less dangerous than the flu for young people” and “you won’t get sick” is completely wrong."
1456,"It’s not that deadly for younger people compared to the older population, that’s true."
1457,But some people have had lingering effects from the disease including respiratory problems.
1458,It’s far more contagious than the flu.
1459,And as far as I know young people are still far more likely to die from covid than from influenza.
1460,"Second, getting the vaccine also makes it less likely that you pass the virus on to someone else, even if you’re not that concerned with getting sick yourself."
1461,I wouldn’t call someone selfish for not wanting to get a vaccine that isn’t fully approved.
1462,But I do think people should want to look out for others.
1463,"I personally think the vaccine is worth it both to avoid the risk of developing long term complications from getting the virus and to reduce the risk that I spread the virus to my loved ones, especially the older people in my family."
1464,"The vaccine is not 100% effective at stopping the virus, so every bit we take to reduce the spread helps."
1465,Wasn't this racist just 1 year ago 🤔
1466,Yeah this is something Nate Silver was saying on Twitter.
1467,"The NYT had a story that was like ""now, more YOUNGER people are getting hospitalized!"""
1468,"And he was like...yeah, younger people being a bigger share of hospitalizations is a *good* thing."
1469,That's because those over 80 are mostly vaccinated
1470,Just for fun’s sake: if you’re required to wear a mask at work (either mandated by local/state government or the business itself) predict what you think your  “mask freedom day” will be; the 1st day in the future you won’t wear a mask to work anymore.
1471,I’m going to say August 1st.
1472,"Been wearing one to work everyday since April 7, ‘20."
1473,[deleted]
1474,I'm a little concerned about how many people are avoiding the vaccine.
1475,Frankly I was surprised at how quickly everyone in my family was able to get appointments once they opened it up to the general public.
1476,Took me about 5 minutes online to set up an appointment for two days later.
1477,If you don’t get the vaccine and you get sick your employer and insurance company should be able to drop you.
1478,Why should they have to pay for your stupidity?
1479,One of your hypotheticals is a variant that escapes the vaccine.
1480,That hasn’t happened yet.
1481,And then he came out yesterday and said he’s a “fucking idiot who shouldn’t be trusted on the subject”.
1482,"I mean too late, he shouldn’t have said it in the first place, but better than nothing."
1483,Exactly.
1484,"I have family/friends in MI, and even the younger of whom are “more worried about the vaccine than the virus.” Also the vaccine has been available to the under 40’s there for a while now, so it doesn’t seem great that there are that many are still unvaccinated."
1485,They aren’t hypotheticals.
1486,They’re happening right now.
1487,You’re just coming up with future doom scenarios and expecting people to know what to do about your hypotheticals.
1488,&gt; And he got COVID at the gym.
1489,"Not to be insensitive, but derp."
1490,It's not the only problem..
1491,It's almost as if... vaccines... work!
1492,Well people need to start coming up with answers *now* or this pandemic will never end.
1493,"Flu doesn’t cause permanent injury in mild cases, so simply partial protection is not enough."
1494,Anything less than sterilizing immunity with this virus isn’t enough.
1495,They were doing fine until our prime minister held political rallies with absolutely no physical distancing and mask mandate.
1496,It didn't help that the government allowed religious festival like Kumbhmela which gathers millions from around the country in one place.
1497,"You ware way more likely to get said clots from covid, by many orders of magnitude"
1498,"I thought you meant that forty people had been vaccinated, and my thought process was ""Jesus, is that, like, a remarkably large proportion of the population of B.C.?"
1499,"Well, I suppose it might be..."""

1531,It’s gonna take half a year to safety test vaccines meant doe those variants and by then new ones will be around.
1532,80% is better than nothing or even 79% but not good enough for true herd immunity where we can function in full pre-pandemic life.
1533,If we’re happy wearing masks and restricting gatherings (for all of society not just anti-social “I already sit in my room alone” type people) for another few years 80% may be good (if it’s long term but we don’t know for sure).

That’s just how many would DIE."
1589,Not even considering how many would be hospitalized and near death.
1590,[deleted]
1591,Yeah no shit.
1592,Older people are vaccinated.
1593,"And for the people who are like ""but 20 year olds are getting hospitalized more"", that's because previously they would be sent home because we didn't have any capacity but now they do so we can admit them."
1594,This isn't bad news no matter what way you try to spin it

1596,Population is not that easy to count.
1597,Russia can easily fudge whatever census statistics they are producing.
1598,That's part of why I think Detroit has the right idea to pay people who deliver others to vaccination sites.
1599,Just found out a good friend of mine there had his uncle died and he got Covid taking him to the hospital.
1600,So much about how India operates is about direct social interaction and in-person transaction.

1608,"As we've seen, the virus mutates given the chance."
1609,There's no guarantee that it won't mutate into something more infectious and deadlier and continues that cycle before herd immunity is reached.
1610,"Not only that, those strains will invariably spread to the rest of the world."
1611,I'd rather not take the risk.
1612,"50% of those eligible, remember that children are ineligible so we're well below 50% of the total population."

1630,France has already implemented this.
1631,I won’t take the increased risk of having extra RNA emergency use vaccine in me when we’ve been shown to have more antibodies than those who had two shots.

1633,https://apnews.com/article/health-europe-coronavirus-pandemic-coronavirus-vaccine-france-869dc3f2776a44c4e48a49deb5febcbb
1634,The vaccines still greatly reduce the risk of hospitalizations and death from new variants because they don't work the same way as getting a natural infection do.
1635,"They are technically less effective against new variants in regards to antibody response, but still incredibly effective."
1636,I would say if you and your family are fully vaccinated you should have no troubles.
1637,"&gt;As far as I’m aware, there are currently no restrictions on private parties or in-person gatherings anywhere in the United States, meaning this prediction of mine was off by several months."

1648,This is not the same virus that it was when it first came around in December.
1649,"It has mutated and adapted and become much more lethal, and that is a main reason we are seeing more young people in hospitals."
1650,"Yea, absolutely younger people not getting vaccine is another factor, but people here seem to be completely disregarding the fact that this virus has changed."
1651,"In Brazil where not as many elderly have been vaxxed as the US, younger and younger people are dying and being hospitalized for COVID."
1652,That’s because the virus has changed and the variants are stronger.
1653,I think she's probably right.
1654,"If Covid just keeps mutating out of control, constantly evading vaccines + natural immunity and never reduces it's infectiousness or lethality, it will indeed be the worst pathogen in human history

Something tells me it's not though..."
1655,"Also, it’s not just hospitalized people who have to be concerned."
1656,"Many long-haulers were healthy before they got COVID, and were never hospitalized as a result of it (many had “minor” cases.)"
1657,"I think the problem is that even though you most likely can't get infected, you can still carry the virus long enough to give it to an unvaccinated person, and that person becomes a potential variant generator."
1658,The virus is like an enemy agent trying to reach a place where they can do the most damage.
1659,"They can stow away on a transport without ever directly invading or harming it, just hitching a ride to get to the real target."
1660,Oh for sure.

1673,That's a source of continued long-term risk in your household.
1674,One afternoon of soccer is a minor exposure compared to hanging around un-vaccinated family members week after week.
1675,I'm happy for you.
1676,Others haven't been so lucky.
1677,My wife and I are retired from the medical business and we've locked ourselves in as much as we possibly can.

Honestly fuck that, everyone needs to know."
1683,I hear way way way way way too fucking much about how people are passing this shit off like a flu because someone they know was sick for a week and got better.
1684,It needs to be more common knowledge that this virus isn't some normal run of the mill shit.
1685,"Most likely, yes, it really was the vaccine."
1686,"The type of clotting disorder is immune related, so there’s a plausible explanation for how the adenovirus vector used in that vaccine could cause that."
1687,"*But,* it only happened in younger women, and even then, it’s still rare."
1688,"If I were choosing to get the vaccine right now, with that information, as a 41 year old woman, I would choose to get Pfizer or Moderna."

1690,"If I were over 55, or a man, I would get whatever they can get in my arm the fastest, J&amp;J included."
1691,It’s not that simple.

1698,Except a gym is a perfect breeding ground for Covid so it's a fair assumption.
1699,These fucking boomers really wanna see the world burn
1700,"The requisite for this was 4 million people having the first shot (decided by the PM, Viktor Orban)."
1701,"On Friday still 100.000 first shots were needed, so they opened up a limited amount of Pfizer doses for everyone, resulting in basically a Hunger Games."

1703,"In fairness, Nate Silver has had some absolutely dreadful takes in this pandemic."
1704,A polls aggregator should not be sticking his oar in this stuff.
1705,"There's people who believe that the mrna vaccine makes one immune to the virus which is not true because it's not explained very clearly by the official s, it reduces the infectiousness of the main part of the viral receptors"
1706,That last sentence is an understatement.
1707,"The vaccines are insanely good at preventing cases overall, and even if you catch Covid while vaccinated the risk of hospitalization and death is so miniscule."
1708,They work great.
1709,&gt;Im tired of this mask fanatism.

1713,"Small nitpick, it's 58% vaccinates now."
1714,Also there's a need to account for the fact that at least 7% of the remaining 42% are recovered.
1715,"as the comparison is not purely between those with vaccine protection and no protection at all (say you test in a group of 100 people where 50 are vaccinated and 50 are recovered, you're not going to get 94% efficacy numbers but something much lower)."
1716,"Some states, yes."
1717,"Other states, no way."
1718,[removed]
1719,Indeed.
1720,"In my area it's a pretty even split between those who have gotten/are getting vaccinated and those who have some sort of ""reason"" as to why they are not or have not scheduled their own vaccinations."
1721,Regardless of any reason for or against vaccination it does appear that an individual's desire to be vaccinated is *heavily* correlated with that individual's political views.
1722,Pfizer and Israel said no concerns
1723,Not if you get a huge population size and where people are not getting the right kind of resources like for example if they could only get rationed care then they don't heal they just keep fighting the virus and the virus spreads and mutates
1724,It doesn’t matter if it is *correct* or *incorrect*.
1725,You should not be taking medical advice from anyone other than a trusted medical professional.
1726,Unfortunately not
1727,"If Rogan announced all people regardless of age should take the vaccine, no one would mention his “lack of expertise in epidemiology”"
1728,Medical statistics is usually not accurate in Russia.
1729,It has been like this for ages and not only for Covid.
1730,Accurate statistics shows shortcomings and poor management so fake data is reported instead.
1731,Covid just is just one of the most notable and obvious examples.
1732,Impossible.
1733,US market is still flooded with products made in China.
1734,There's no way the production remains so long like this if the situation was so bad.
1735,I'm 40 and I do this
1736,Does the TSA control airports or something?
1737,I thought they only did security.
1738,I didn’t know they were airport authority.
1739,I recall someone mentioning that given India's huge population about 25-27 thousand people would die in India every day.
1740,"He then pointed out that there is no way the crematoriums would be swamped, and extra crematorium sites needed, for an extra 3,000 daily deaths due to COVID."
1741,The real death toll must be far higher.
1742,"hate to say but Michigan was one of those states that wanted to kidnap &amp; kill its governor, literally."
1743,"They wanted to go go full India, because survival of the fittest."
1744,Garbage link
1745,That's highly doubtful.
1746,"I'm a healthcare provider and work with covid patients, and throughout the pandemic have very regularly tested."
1747,I also went ahead and had an antibody test out of personal curiosity last fall.
1748,No test I've ever taken has ever been positive.

1750,Feel free to tell the people that are hospitalized that it's a good thing.
1751,Have a feeling they'd disagree.
1752,Going to Michigan next weekend too and like you an vaccinated with moderna.
1753,No it doesnt have full protection against the variants.
1754,The vaccine was developed before the variants arose.
1755,They are working in third doses right now to include them.
1756,"With all due respect, I think you've waited long enough."
1757,"Please, get vaccinated as soon as you can."
1758,Immunity from infection isn't as good as immunity from a vaccine.
1759,"It's better to be vaccinated and not need it, than to not be vaccinated and need it."
1760,"If you value a return to pre-pandemic normal, then get vaccinated."
1761,"This relies on *everyone* who's eligible to get one, to actually get one."
1762,"Sure, actually reaching a %100 vaccination rate is unrealistic, but don't assume that everyeone else will get one just because you won't."
1763,Be better than that.
1764,"""I've never seen it so it can't be true!"""
1765,"Don’t think that the second dose may be a waste of time based on the article: 

&gt;	Additional research needs to be done before this strategy could be deployed in the general population."
1766,This includes long-term follow-up to see how long immunity lasts after a single dose in previously infected people.
1767,Larger samples from diverse populations are also needed to account for individual variation in immune responses to infection and vaccination.
1768,So...
1769,Someone said this in 2014 and it has stuck with me since.
1770,Modi is running behind a personal legacy...
1771,"He is not interested in running the country, he is interested in becoming the father of the nation...."
1772,What do you think Monthly average through March 2021 means?
1773,"Confirmed does not equal infected

At least pont confirmed cases something is just a tool to track changes instead of actual cases, positivity rate is what matter now"
1774,"as much as i feel for the families of those who're being sickened and hospitalized, as long as we're not seeing break-through cases i think it's time we lay some of the blame for this surge on those who refuse to be vaccinated."
1775,"I'm not for victim-blaming, but it's like not wearing a seat belt when you're in a car."

1799,"&gt; Overproduction - have to put loads of doses in the bin

There are still more than 7 billion people who haven't had a chance to get even a single one."

1817,"They aren’t trying to make that comparison: if you look at the chart in the article, they have a column for December, one for the average of January through March, and one for April."
1818,Do I know if it’s riskier now than last March?
1819,"No, because that’s not what the article is about."

1909,Is it safe to assume that the people in the U.S. still dying from COVID are those who had the chance to get vaccinated but didn't?
1910,How else can we explain the 700+ deaths that occur each day?
1911,"And that 19.1 million likely represent a small fraction of actual cases, due to lack of testing capacity."
1912,"I can testify from experience that the parosmia doesn’t remove your preference for the food, just your ability to enjoy it."
1913,"And unfortunately, it appears (at least for me) to be linked to foods that contain thiols - which are mainly healthy foods like asparagus, onions, grapefruits, eggs, etc."
1914,"Sadly, the “safest” foods for me now are processed, bland foods like white bread and chips."
1915,"I remember a few studies indicated that obesity was a big risk factor, but oddly smoking had little effect on risk."
1916,"Who are the TSA and flight workers unions though, but people?"
1917,"They are not robots; they are people like you and I who don't want to wear masks forever, and have to deal with the headaches of enforcing it."
1918,The vast majority of people don't want to do this any longer than they have to.
1919,"For me, Pfizer second dose was fatigue and a sore arm the second day, and an itchy underarm the third."

1922,I would have happily taken considerably more unpleasant side effects.
1923,I've gone to the store without crippling fear for the first time in over a year.
1924,Fat?
1925,One person in the Kentucky nursing home outbreak out of the multiple deaths was fully vaccinated.
1926,However; it was a resident so age was likely a factor.
1927,Only morons are for recalling the governor.

1934,How wrong I was!
1935,"I lost my smell completely, but not my hunger."
1936,"All the foods I liked tasted strange and unpleasant with no sense of smell, and I found myself eating strange stuff - uncooked pasta, cans of peas, *anything* just to feel sated."
1937,"Sometimes, I’d eat something like an apple, and my brain would decide that since it didn’t smell like an apple, it was probably poison, and I’d get incredibly nauseated."
1938,"I got my sense of smell back after a couple months, and for a while all was well."
1939,"Now, four months later, all of a sudden my sense of smell is twisted and gross."
1940,Coffee smells like hot garbage water.
1941,"Healthy, wonderful foods like asparagus and eggs and grapefruit taste and smell like rotting meat."
1942,I find myself drawn towards simple flavors like white bread and potato chips because I’m afraid to try something and experience that awful smell/taste yet again.
1943,It definitely hasn’t been good for my waistline!
1944,"Anosmia and parosmia are far from the worst side effects of Covid - but I could never have predicted how unsettling and depressing they’d be, and I’m kicking myself now for ever wishing for it, even as a joke!"
1945,"Got my first Moderna shot Friday, second shot on the 28th."
1946,In 2 weeks I'll be 80% protected and in 4 my covid shield will be complete.
1947,Go get your shot!
1948,"All true,  and agree."

1996,It's good that the vaccine is helping old people but it's bad that the virus is hitting young people harder.
1997,&gt; people under 40 with no pre-existing conditions were 5-7 times more likely to be hospitalized from covid infections in February compared to November.

During the 2019-2020 influenza season, CDC estimates that influenza was associated with 38 million illnesses, 18 million medical visits, 405,000 hospitalizations, and 22,000 deaths."
2009,"The influenza burden was higher in young children (0-4 years) and adults (18-49 years) compared with a recent season with the 2017-2018 season, a recent season with high severity, and provides evidence to support how severe seasonal influenza can be at any age."

22,000 deaths for the entire year...that's 60 per day, across the entire US."

2013,That’s why they said most.
2014,No it doesn’t.
2015,The methodology for estimating flu deaths is insanely bad.
2016,"IIRC it basically assumes that 90% of flu cases aren’t reported, which is reasonable since most people don’t go to the doctor for the flu."
2017,"Then it takes the number of flu deaths they know about, and multiples that by 10, to account for unreported cases."
2018,"But obviously the flu cases that go into the hospital will be the severe ones, and account for the vast majority of the deaths."
2019,And they probably think you’re wrong

2056,You can get longer times with preservatives and more testing.
2057,Wouldn’t have been worth the time/effort for any of the vaccine companies at this stage.
2058,The virus does kill children.
2059,"It only kills a very small percentage of the ones who get infected, but when you get tens of thousands of infected infants alone, then you get pediatric deaths."
2060,Pretending kids aren't dying from COVID-19 doesn't make your point.
2061,"And if you really don't know that COVID-19 has killed kids, get a better source of information."
2062,And adults can protect their kids by masking and social distancing until they are fully vaccinated.
2063,Allowing this virus to mutate in people only gives it more opportunities to turn into something that is even worse for children.
2064,'Hoarding' was actually a euphemism on my part.

2224,That means you don’t understand the science.
2225,Of course many people reach more than 50% efficacy two weeks after the first mRNA dose.
2226,I said that very clearly.
2227,But not everyone will get the same efficacy from one mRNA dose.
2228,"If there are any immune conditions, if they are elderly they can have a drastically reduced efficacy from only one dose."
2229,"None of this is different for J&amp;J, so it's irrelevant."
2230,"The point is, the net efficacy of even 1 shot of mNRA vaccines, as long as you get a second dose, are higher after two weeks than J&amp;J, and yet the guidance is different."
2231,For not good reasons.

2273,I do think it has convinced people a little.
2274,"Here in Oregon, we’ve had so few cases up til now that I find that people fall into 2 categories - they are either so terrified of covid and think they are likely to die if they get it (bc they don’t know anyone who got it and wasn’t very sick, just read news) or they think it’s no big deal bc they don’t know anyone who died or got super sick from it."
2275,"Real number is most likely 10x that and with exponential growth, the death numbers will be shocking beyond already shocking amounts seen last year."
2276,"It's a combination of a variety of reasons: lack of access to vaccines, people who are against the vaccine, and relatively low virus infection rates which do drive vaccination numbers down I believe quite a bit"

2282,Over 50% of adults 16 and over have now had at least 1 vaccine shot.
2283,"We're starting to see vaccine demand dry up, but that's to be expected."
2284,I think some of the 'red' (conservative) states are struggling a bit with higher infection rates and healthcare demand.

2401,Thanks for clarifying!!
2402,!
2403,I do think the variant must’ve had something to do with it.
2404,There’s just no logical reason it didn’t take hold sooner given India’s extremely dense  population and lack of sanitation.
2405,Seems like the original forms of the virus didn’t thrive in India for whatever reasons...maybe climate or some natural immunity in the Population.

2415,It's only 3 to 8 out of a million because vaccinated people are still following general protection guidelines.
2416,They stop that completely while there is still large community spread it could easily increase 10 fold or more deaths per million of vaccines.
2417,Which in the US could lead to 10s of thousands of fully vaccinated people dying over the coming year.
2418,We need to continue precautions until the vaccine had reached enough people to reduce community spread to background levels.
2419,I think there is an interesting discussion to be had about the degree to which other people's heath is an individual's personal responsibility.
2420,"As someone who has literally stayed home for the entire pandemic, literally not leaving my house except to visit one family member or walk my dog while masked, I think I could justify not getting the vaccine more than someone who is out and about quite a bit and possibly works in a public-facing job."
2421,I got vaxxed but I'm just saying there is some nuance to be had in the discussion.
2422,"If you just stay home, I think that's about as good as getting vaccinated, frankly."
2423,I agree a little more thought was needed to encourage and mandate vaccines.
2424,"There could have been the carrot, stimulus money, better tracking of who was vaccinated (maybe it is being tracked but the current paper records aren't secure), a passport enabling more freedoms for those who were vaccinated until we reached 80% vaccinated."

“This report does not address the prevention of Covid-19 in other populations, such as younger adolescents, children, and pregnant women."

Furthermore, it is most definitely still only approved under EUA."

2571,"The vast majority of those mutations will either have no effect or will actually be mal-adaptive, but given the sheer numbers of antivaxxers (several hundred million around the world, about 100 million in the US), it’s practically a guarantee that in any given year, a beneficial mutation to the virus will occur that makes it more resistant to the vaccines or more contagious."
2572,(Or both.)
2573,It has already happened several times.
2574,There are several beneficial mutations that happened via random mutation due to the sheer number of infected people there are at any given time.

2584,Now that is a quote.
2585, But I also heard that it isn’t as effective to ship doses to India as it is to give them all of the raw materials they need since India is the #1 producer of the AZ vaccine?
2586,"I mean, give them all of the help they need."
2587,I just heard some Redditors from India saying they have the capabilities to make the vaccine quickly in-house.
2588,"Other vaccines - the rubella component in MMR, against hepatitis A and chicken pox - are produced in the same way; similar to drugs that must be tested on identical cell cultures before they can be used in clinical trials."
2589,"The government did not react to the moral panic of the episcopate - or it still has little knowledge of virology (which is very likely) and did not know the arguments that could weaken Bishop Wróbel's phobias, or deliberately decided to remain silent, hoping that it would dry itself."
2590,"Many older people, traditionally more sensitive to the teachings of the Church, have already been vaccinated with Pfizer and Moderna, and younger generations are more afraid of the risk of thrombosis (although its probability is minimal) than the fixations of fundamentalists, so they deny the Astra and Johnson vaccinations collectively anyway."
2591,"We checked a dozen or so vaccination points in Silesia - out of ten people, three or four agree to it!"
2592,"Fake pandemic The latest changes in the vaccination schedule, opening it up to almost all comers, and the decision to allow unused doses to be given to anyone over 18 years old, is the government's reaction to the increasing signals that interest in vaccinations is declining in younger age groups and the lack of a second dose ."
2593,"Although the Ministry of Health updates the statistics daily, showing the number of vaccinations is constantly increasing, it does not say how many people who should have been immunized long ago have still not shown interest."
2594,"Out of 157 thousand As of April 20, the second dose of authorized doctors received the second dose, and the first 86% - Does that mean that others would sign an appeal for ""improperly tested vaccines that can lead to gene modification"", or are they affected by other phobias?"
2595,"In other medical professions, the percentage of unvaccinated people is even greater, with only half of the nurses, midwives and pharmacists after the second dose."
2596,The first was accepted only by 70 percent.
2597,"From the group of 16 thousand Laboratory diagnosticians were vaccinated with the first dose of 72 percent, and the second dose only 57 percent, although the stage ""0"" provided for them is long behind us."
2598,"Moderate interest has also arisen among 60-year-olds, because less than a half of the five-million-strong representation of this age group has so far been instilled."
2599,Still waiting for the first injection of 1 million 475 thousand.
2600,people aged 75+.
2601,"Apparently, the oldest seniors are currently the best vaccinated population in Poland, but the e-Health Center data shows that after 3,969,504 referrals were issued, 1,389,289 people received the first dose and the second 916,844 people."
2602,So also not even half of it has been reached.
2603,So what will be the answer of the younger age groups?
2604,"30- and 40-year-olds do not see many victims of covid among their peers, so they perceive the pandemic through the prism of restrictions and do not understand the relationship between the degree of vaccination of society and the date of return to a relatively normal life."
2605,"Especially that after the sting it is still required to wear masks and respect sanitary rules - loosening of the restrictions should be expected only after achieving herd immunity, i.e."
2606,at the level of immunity of approx.
2607,the whole of society.
2608,And how is this going to happen?
2609,since the enthusiasm is clearly declining?
2610,"The youngest age groups are most influenced by social media, where conspiracy theories are buzzing."
2611,"And the system is constructed in such a way that it is enough to hit one anti-vaccine bubble to not be able to get out of it quickly - Facebook, Twitter or Instagram algorithms can perfectly read the emotions of a delinquent caught online and offer him friends and content tailored to his expectations."
2612,"After reading the discussions on Internet forums, one can only confirm the belief that Bill Gates does want to depopulate the world through vaccination or that gene damage is one of the side effects."
2613,"And even if someone does not believe this absurdity, he will certainly be convinced by the opinion of a neighbor or a peer, who will call a temporary pain in the arm or a fever of two days the worst suffering in life and advise against this ""experiment."""
2614,"According to the sociologist Tomasz Sobierajski, anti-vaccination movements do their best to present their pseudoscientific assumptions, based on emotions, judgments and internal fears in a way that resembles the language of science."
2615,- It is a paradox because people who oppose scientific achievements try to pretend to be scientists by relying on both false research and questionable authorities.
2616,"It is also a paradox that the media, and often scientists themselves, are more and more often defending these pseudo-authorities, referring to the need to maintain symmetry and freedom of speech."
2617,"Thus, the repeated nonsense becomes truthful."
2618,And it spreads like a virus for which there is no vaccine.

2640,You are more likely to be hit by lightning twice than to have a complication post vaccination.
2641,At some point you need to realize that there are risks in life.
2642,"Among this risks that exist everyday, covid post vaccination should be the least of your worries."
2643,Everyone knows Florida has lied about their numbers lmfao
2644,"&gt; But I really think that many people in government want this pandemic and the restrictions to go on as long as they can so they can pass as much stimulus as possible under the guise of 'we have to do this cuz pandemic'

Is there some of that?"
2645,"Maybe, but I doubt its a main driving factor."
2646,"I think the biggest thing is that doing too little or the perception of doing too little has pretty serious political cost, while being overly cautious doesn't have quite the same down side."
2647,Their contract with AZ supposedly didn’t allow them to send the doses to third countries.
2648,Thus the lend lease fiction.
2649,I guess that has been sorted out now since we are just giving the doses to India.
2650,You have source on that statement?

2716,I scheduled a rapid just to be sure.
2717,I'll give my honest thoughts on a few fronts.
2718,"First of all, I don't believe that going into the ring with visions of elbow-dropping them with ""science says I'm right and you're wrong"" does anything good for persuasion."
2719,"If persuading others is tangential and you just want to fluff up your own ego because their opinions annoy you, then go for it."
2720,"(Their opinions *are* annoying, so I'm not even calling this illegit.)"
2721,"Yeah, blood clots, and other weird freak reactions are a non-zero risk."
2722,They're pretty damn close to zero though.
2723,Here is how I think about relative risk.
2724,"Warning, it's morbid."
2725,[These are the actuarial tables](https://www.ssa.gov/oact/STATS/table4c6.html).
2726,"They predict the likelihood of dying within the next 365 days, for any reason, at any age."
2727,The actuaries tend to be terrifyingly good at their job; it's their analysis that life insurers lean on to decide whether someone's worth the risk of underwriting a policy to.
2728,My age bracket falls in the rough range of 1 in 500 odds of getting wiped off the planet before making it to the next birthday for no reason other than shit luck.
2729,I tend not to think about this risk because there's always a risk of shit luck in life.
2730,"It's a background level of low, but irremovable risk."
2731,It doesn't bother me because to let it bother me would make life unlivable.
2732,"If something is so low-risk that you have to move the decimal point to the left of your actuarial background odds of death more than once to describe it, it's likewise not something that I can let bother me, unless it's a dice I'm going to be rolling multiple times a day."
2733,"So they had, what, very low double digit occurrence of blood clots, out of millions of vaccines given?"
2734,That's a *three* decimal point shift to the left from my background risk of death.
2735,On a one-time dice roll.
2736,An utterly meaningless level of risk.
2737,"In exchange, what do I get?"
2738,"Well, if they're quoting Joe Rogan about how healthy young people are already at low risk from COVID even without the vaccine... that part isn't strictly wrong."
2739,This is where I don't agree that we should scan the news for breakthrough or extreme outlier cases or anecdotes about young people who had bad COVID outcomes.
2740,For the same reason that it's wrong to do that with freak rare occurrences of damaging vaccination symptoms.
2741,We don't go through life judging risks by the rare outcomes at the tail end.
2742,"And that's what COVID severity for healthy young people is - a rare, tail-end outcome."
2743,"All the people beating that ""fear of COVID is good ackshually"" drum are going to internalize that cognitively errant ethos and wake up flummoxed 20 years later that they've never been able to feel safe about anything and they've wasted their whole lives."
2744,It's stupid.
2745,"If you're young and healthy, you're extremely unlikely to die from COVID, or go to the hospital, or have lifelong damage."
2746,Variants or not.
2747,Misleading people about this doesn't help anyone.
2748,"Yes, when something is as widely dispersed as COVID is, even the low-risk tail-end outcome of bad outcomes for young people could wind up higher than we'd like in aggregate, and that's a legitimate public health challenge."
2749,But a healthy young person evaluating their risks isn't wrong to say that they're exceedingly low.
2750,"I personally weighted the threat of lockdowns to my mental health and personal security to be higher than the risks I'd faced if I caught COVID, and I still leapt for the first vaccine appointment I could get like it was a chance to hi-five Jimi Hendrix."
2751,Why?
2752,"1) The higher the # of total vaccinations goes, the more likely the country will calm the eff down."
2753,I like being able to contribute to that.
2754,"2) While the chance isn't brought to zero (nothing is; see above; actuaries), the post-vaccination odds that I could ever unknowingly transmit COVID to someone at elevated risk are absolutely demolished."
2755,"Some of our public health messaging has chosen to downplay that astounding feat of science because they feel like they can't say ""vaccines prevent transmission"" so long as the odds of transmission are 0.00001%."
2756,Eff 'em.
2757,"3) If your friends hate the restrictions like I do, then getting vaccinated emboldens you to push the envelope."
2758,"Now I feel extra confident doing crazy things like going for a run outdoors without a mask in my home state (well, up until this week, when they finally came back to reality)."
2759,"If every measurable indicator that tells you ""this be a pandemic"" goes back to normal and sticklers still insist on safety theater even though the COVID threat is demonstrably quelled, then it helps to be vaccinated."
2760,Because then you get to turn the tables on the people who want masks until 2026 and ask them why *they* don't believe in the science - of the vaccines.
2761,"Spite, baby."
2762,"If it helps get someone off the fence and into the pharmacy for their vaccine, then load it up."

2861,And that's what you do best.

2864,Total people in hospitals could include people that have been there for weeks/months.
2865,Look at the data again and get back to me.
2866,High income countries are the ones manufacturing the vaccine in the first place.

2879,"&gt; We should take care of our bodies physically, emotionally and spiritually, but if it’s my time to go and it’s by Covid, well then, it’s my time to go

What other physical ailments would they replace Covid with in that sentence, and why is Covid any different?"
2880,"If Covid is somehow a special case, then they're not actually taking care of their bodies physically, but simply making up terrible excuses."
2881,As much.

2898,Butan: Where am I?
2899,I can only assume you are also an idiot since the bases for this article specifically  goes on to address the points you mention.
2900,"He is a laughing stock in the  Virology world for a reason, which is why he has to push his pseudo science onto complete morons without any true understanding of how vaccines work."
2901,"Perhaps they have not noticed that there is a highly contagious pandemic disease which is going around, and the vaccines offer nearly 100% protection from hospitalization and death?"
2902,The vaccine is a huge net benefit in terms of risk.
2903,"1 in 7 million chance of death from blood clot from J&amp;J    
1 in one million chance of hospitalization from blood clot from J&amp;J vaccine    
Btw you don't even have to get J&amp;J!"
2904,"5,000 in one million chance of death from Covid (going up due to UK variant)

Risk profile also depends on demographics, but all demographics have a substantial net benefit in risk considering the chance to get the disease over the 6-12 months."
2905,Plus the vaccines protect those around you and that you live with and work with.
2906,Kind of fucked up that you'd paint an entire province with your stereotypes.
2907,We're a Federation and ought to have each other's backs.
2908,"But whatever, it's a nice place with decent people and amazing natural beauty."
2909,Don't let prejudice blind you.
2910,"Of course the NYT would rather handwring about the white and rural not wanting the vaccine instead of the minority and urban, such as in happening in L.A.

https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2021-04-30/suddenly-l-a-county-has-more-vaccine-than-people-willing-to-take-it-heres-why-this-alarms-officials

It’s amazing how different the tone is when talking about vaccine hesitancy in different areas and populations."
2911,Fucking do it.
2912,"Get all of the turbo-conservative military personnel vaccinated, see how their worshippers react when the vast, vast majority of them are perfectly fine afterward."
2913,Only 1/3rd are fully vaccinated as of today.
2914,Your own post I replied to admitted there's evidence there's no God.
2915,&gt; There’s equal amounts of evidence supporting and disproving a magic sky man.
2916,Let people be religious if they want.
2917,So were you wrong then or are you wrong now?
2918,Furthermore you need evidence to make a claim.
2919,No proof = no God.
2920,"one of those states where Biden lost by about 1%, unfortunately."
2921,there are too many people here who are ACTIVELY refusing the vaccine.
2922,I don't mean they are lazy or procrastinating... no... they are actively protesting against the vaccines.
2923,:( :( :(  (sad)
2924,I don’t think anyone is getting their first dose then decides they don’t want to get the second one..?
2925,Those who do are probably a fringe case not worth putting public effort into.
2926,Like this isn’t a problem?
2927,"To understand it a different way, as long as you do your viral spreading before you do your host killing, it doesn’t matter if you are highly lethal."
2928,People with Covid aren’t dying right away.
2929,They might not even be infectious still by the time they die.
2930,A lot of people think Bill Gates put microchips in the vaccine.
2931,It's completely bonkers.
2932,[removed]
2933,That's not correct.
2934,It's compared to an unvaccinated person.
2935,"It's basically ""if 20 unvaccinated people get it, only 1 vaccinated person would get it, all else equal""."
2936,People don't avoid vaccines because those celebrities are telling them to.
2937,People had already decided they're not getting the vaccine and they're taking in solace in someone agreeing with them who also carries a fanbase.
2938,"That’s my secret, cap’

I’m always bored"
2939,Can confirm - I passed out 2 minutes after getting my first shot due to low blood pressure.
2940,"I absolutely hate needles and the guy at the vaccine appointment said I probably worked myself prior to getting the shot, and then afterwards once I calmed down my blood pressure fell through the floor."
2941,"When MA says we are now the most vaccinated state, then releases a 8/1 reopening with 8/22 in Boston, you can understand where this message is lost."

2948,"I personally I’m full vaccinated and think that everyone attending in-person classes should be vaccinated, unless they have medical/religious reason (that is documented)."
2949,August will be the latest 2nd doses based on deliveries.
2950,No need to worry about that.
2951,"And even if you would not get it, there is proper science that say that your long-term protection might even be better in this longer interval."
2952,No need to worry
2953,How would you suggest we do that?
2954,All I got was the piece of paper.
2955,"true, but until now, they only required shots that are fully FDA approved, which covid vaccines aren´t yet"
2956,Your position is that you can't understand cost-benefit analysis.
2957,Ok.

3002,[removed]
3003,Here's one I've been thinkin' on u/lovememychem since I'm scheduled for a Moderna shot soon.
3004,The main thing that's been concerning me has been the seeming uncertainty of long term effects of the vaccine.
3005,From what we can tell now most people who get the shot don't suffer that many side effects.
3006,"In fact, my parents have felt none whatsoever after their first shot of the Moderna."
3007,But people keep raising the point that we physically cannot have long term studies yet since it's so new.
3008,"But at the same time, I've read that RNA has been studied for many many decades and that shifting vaccines towards mRNA has been looked at since roughly 2004 because it would be safer?"
3009,"As far as my basic knowledge goes, the idea is that the mRNA causes temporary production of ""dummy"" spike proteins, the mRNA is then degraded (not entirely sure what that means in this context) and is flushed out of the system along with the spike proteins once they've been destroyed over a number of hours after vaccination."
3010,"Is this about right and, if so, would this mean that the likelyhood of this developing into, say, a Pandemrix situation down the line where people develop side effects years later is extremely low if not impossible since the ingredients are flushed out of the system over the course of roughly a day or so?"
3011,This info may be scrambled since I've only gotten bits and pieces.
3012,Are people actually distancing?
3013,Even with how bad things are now the footage I see does not show any distancing.
3014,I’ve only been to India once but personal space is not a thing there so I imagine a bunch of people competing for a vaccine will be super close.
3015,And I’m double jabbed with Pfizer so certainly not an anti vaxxer
3016,Clearly just a very bad year for falling out of windows
3017,"Biden used the same law that Trump did to secure additional large orders from Pfizer and Moderna over the course of several weeks/months, it was one of his first acts after being sworn in."
3018,"I don't know the precise terms, but essentially the law allows the US executive branch to enter into contracts for a good of national importance, and in these the contracts the manufacturer must fulfill all of the order to the US government before fulfilling any others."
3019,"It's not so much an ""export ban"" in the typical sense."
3020,"It's more like, you have to fill the orders we placed before anyone else's."
3021,This is a sign that Pfizer is on track to fulfill the contract and begin supplying the rest of the world.
3022,I am not sure on these numbers but I have been following this wave in India while on my breaks at work.
3023,So they were doing around 1million to 1.2 million tests a day.
3024,Then 1.5  and now I believe they are close to doing 2 million tests a day.
3025,That is the testing and the numbers are terrible.
3026,But you don't hear about the rural areas where 3/4 of East Indians live.
3027,The rural areas are getting wrecked by this Covid wave.
3028,They arent even capable of reporting the deaths in those regions and they can't give out accurate figures.
3029,So likely the actual number is WAY higher.
3030,I bet it's an absolute nightmare over there.
3031,"But still people believe in bullshit cures like taking a dip in sacred water (in reality dirty water that's full of bacteria) , and a lot of the people have resorted to witch doctors or the black market for cures."
3032,I did read that the major car companies in India have closed shop and the Oxygen they use has been directed towards the crisis.
3033,That's basically the only good thing I've read about this whole thing.
3034,You can't have 1.4 billion people all squeezed in while Covid is running wild.
3035,They need to be properly educated on the crisis  and that's where the government fails.
3036,They have let their people die and the numbers are shocking but are likely much higher.
3037,India is in a lot of trouble and the world needs to help it like Brazil because when you have millions of people catching Covid you end up with monster mutations that might fuck up the whole purpose of the vaccines.
3038,Just a nightmare scenario.
3039,Yeah opposite of here in MA where we announced we are already approaching 70% of adults getting their first shot and as a thank you we were given an 8/1 opening date for the state and a Labor Day opening for Boston.
3040,It's pathetic and demoralizing.

3137,"The link only had EUA, not full approval!"
3138,"&gt; So let me get this straight, I'm cherry picking by defining vaccination as ""fully vaccinated"" (where Florida is 3% higher)?"
3139,"I mean, who cares who was ahead 3-4 weeks ago?"
3140,"You can call everything a clear national security threat with enough mental gymnastics, that's why there's barriers to prevent that."
3141,"And because the military has operated just fine without the vaccine over the past year, it would be very difficult to justify an executive order that says that it is."
3142,And Congress passed a law giving military members the right to deny vaccines under EUAs for good reason and that legislation shouldn't be destroyed via executive order.
3143,"Full approval is likely coming down this year, and that's when you can make it mandatory."
3144,Because your child isn’t vaccinated and has underlying medical problems?
3145,These parents should be charged with manslaughter.

3147,"Coincidentally, today was my “Max vax” day."
3148,(Don’t have any big plans except maybe a restaurant meal.)
3149,Government has done a shit job with public messaging.
3150,We don’t do this with any other vaccine.
3151,"We don’t fear measles, hepatitis, or any of the other diseases we are vaccinated for, and for good reason."
3152,The message should be “get a vaccine and the pandemic is over for you”.
3153,Anyone who believes otherwise is being a hypochondriac and doesn’t understand the actual risks (or lack there of)
3154,"I'm not sure about commonplace but I do think a handful will keep wearing them, something you never saw before 2020."
3155,This is great!
3156,Just applied :)
3157,"I mean don't get me wrong, Aus, NZ, and SK have handled this well but for all intents and purposes these are all islands."
3158,Let me explain; Aus and NZ are obvious and with their fear (based on geographical proximity to Asia and SARS etc) they quickly took this far seriously than those in the Western hemisphere.
3159,Hats off to them because clearly it worked.
3160,South Korea as well is virtually an island.
3161,"It's on the bottom of a peninsula (ocean on three sides), and has the worlds most militarized border to its north."
3162,Plus (just like Vietnam) they have a healthy degree of skepticism about anything China says so naturally they took it very seriously.
3163,"All-in-all, countries in the western hemisphere could've done WAAAAY more to stop covid but then again, we weren't as mistrusting of China, we're not out of the way islands, and are way more globalized than the aforementioned countries."
3164,I honestly don't see how America or Britain (my two countries) with being so globalized (and Britain being insanely densely populated) were going to fare much better in this.
3165,Good work!
3166,"I always have a 50/50 chance of completely passing out after injections, and I definitely did just that after my first shot."
3167,Second shot went smoothly though.

3169,"And that proves that yet again, the viscous New York Times is unfairly picking on white people."

3172,Got my second Pfizer shot today.
3173,No symptoms...yet.
3174,Same with the EU.
3175,The made deals without specifying domestic supply just for domestic use so they’re lagging behind.

3177,Australian here.
3178,Yeah nah.
3179,"Yep, I have been saying that vaccines from those *particular areas* should just be shipped in tranches to India."
3180,It's a win-win as far as I'm concerned.
3181,It might be enough for some of those dolts to get vaccinated if they learned their doses was being shipped there.
3182,Utahn here.
3183,I'm not too surprised by the complete absence of Utah universities on that list.
3184,"Sorely disappointed, but not surprised."

3187,Those are not distanced people.
3188,"Like even the lines where it should be easy to just put space between one another, they're standing pressed up on each other, I have no idea if anyone even has told them to try to keep some kind of space between each other."
3189,what's the data on taking over the counter pain relievers with Pfizer?
3190,Girlfriend took ibuprofen ~12 hours after her second shot when she was having chills and bad headache
3191,I really wish the world worked more like this.
3192,"I’m in the US and last week I made an appointment to get the vaccine and it was in my arm in less than 24 hours, it could have been in under 3 hours but I was running late for something."
3193,"We got it good here, glad to hear we’re helping out other countries now too."

3199,"It's not just about protecting the non-vaccinated (which by the way includes everyone under age 16, so maybe we should consider that?)."
3200,Vaccines are not 100% effective and I would want the extra simple layer of protection in a crammed metal tube in the sky.
3201,"It's stupid not to require it, considering that this is how the original virus and all the variants have spread to every corner of the Earth."
3202,A bunch of people on this sub don't realize it's a team effort either.
3203,"They just say, ""for people who won't get the shot, that's their problem but the pandemic is over for the rest of us"" without considering that we need to hit a certain vaccination target for this to end."

3214,That's how you sound.
3215,I’m saying this was prior to vaccination.

3232,"https://www.semana.com/vida-moderna/articulo/lecciones-de-chile-la-primera-dosis-de-sinovac-no-protege/202111/ I wasn't wrong that they claim the first dose ""offers very little protection""

&gt; De hecho, hace unos días las autoridades mostraron los resultados de una investigación con una muestra de 10,5 millones de personas en la que la efectividad contra la infección luego de la primera dosis resultó ser de apenas 16 por ciento."
3233,"&gt; In fact, a few days ago authorities demonstrated the results of an invenstigation with a sample of 10.5 million people in which the effectiveness against infection after the first done was only 16 percent."
3234,"This is in contrast to first-dose protection against infection of other vaccines, which hover at around 65-85%, equal or above the protection offered by Sinovac's SECOND dose."
3235,"I do admit I had read the second dose hospitalization rates are a bit higher than I remember, though."

3237,"Not sure about specific mutations, but I honestly haven't heard of any variant breaking past any vaccines yet."

3245,Lungs usually fully recover from pneumonia.
3246,COVID scarring appears a lot more permanent.
3247,"That aside, does this happen in those who have been vaccinated against Measles, or does this largely (like, 99.9% of the time) only happen to those who haven’t been vaccinated?"
3248,Are there kids under 16 involved?
3249,"A lot of people still keep up some precautions (meeting outside, for example) for the sake of their unvaccinated kids."
3250,"Just to jump on, F the TSA."
3251,You can get a free donut every day for the rest of the year.

3268,That is why Covax stepped in to even out the distribution among countries.
3269,But they are already late as the bilateral deals are already on-going.
3270,Right it makes me a tad ashamed to say I’m an introvert because yes in introverted but I like socializing and being in public with people I like.
3271,"If you are stupid enough to refuse a free vaccine and subsequently fake a security card, I don't see why your fellow citizens are required to protect you."
3272,All the virus really needs to do is outpace the immune system in eradicating it while having a sufficient mechanism for easy spread to other people.
3273,"If the virus does the first, it will eventually cause some organ failure and death."
3274,"If it does the second, it will become a common popular strain."
3275,"For HIV, it takes years to kill; and its primary mechanism for spread to other humans is the same mechanism for making other humans."
3276,Except India.
3277,Has it caused harm?
3278,"Not in my opinion, but I don’t think it’s the best analogy."
3279,"Being inside a moving car unbuckled will never be safe, where a vaccinated person is incredibly safe from COVID."
3280,The seat belt analogy should only be narrowly applied to the question of whether governments have the power to enact public health mandates.

3287,duh.. thats what a typical inactivated vaccine rate is.

3290,"Quick question, Is Pfizer Biontech vaccine efective against Indian varient &amp; b.1.1.7 varient ?"
3291,"I can’t speak for the whole state, but I live in Lane County which is now in the extreme risk category."
3292,Fifty-six percent of adults are partially vaccinated and 40% are fully vaccinated.
3293,"It’s also the home of the University of Oregon, and that seems to be the source of our increased cases, especially since 16+ were only recently eligible for the vaccine."
3294,"We have 17 people in county hospitals, and it’s been 24 days since the last death was reported."
3295,At least in Lane County restaurants don’t seem to be the source of the outbreaks so I’m not sure that these latest restrictions will do much.

3319,So far

3321,](https://theprint.in/world/israel-warns-against-indian-covid-strain-experts-say-pfizer-vaccine-can-neutralise-it/649123/)There is more data needed.

3323,16 minutes after my first shot.
3324,Ambulance came and all that.
3325,One of the scariest days of my life.
3326,EMS and Pharmacist all told me not to get the second shot.
3327,(I'm in my mid 40s).
3328,Did you know prior to the vaccine 3-4 million people got measles every year?
3329,Also they are not understanding how natural selection works.
3330,"There is zero selective pressure for a virus with a high degree of presymptomatic transmission to become less lethal than it currently is, unless it literally was running out of people to infect."
3331,And the virus doesn't care or know anything about its long term survival.
3332,"It just is what it is and it is driven by natural selection for whatever allows it to continue to exist in the moment, until it ceases to exist, if it were extremely lethal."
3333,"Viruses likely mainly get less lethal with time due to our immune system memory, not because they are plowing through the population and killing enough people for this to be a selective pressure, at least in more modern times."
3334,"With COVID-19, increased transmission rate seems to go hand-in-hand with more severe disease due to the resulting higher viral loads in individuals that are infected with these ""stickier"" mutants."
3335,Came to the comments to say this.
3336,It’s so depressing and frustrating that we’re going backwards while the rest of the country is opening up
3337,Good luck to the holdouts.
3338,The variants are more transmissible so they will ensure that the holdouts contribute to herd immunity one way or another
3339,I got yellow fever vaccine (stamaril) few years ago.
3340,I had no reaction
3341,*India agrees*

3350,"Several of those counties capture a portion of the Portland metro area but extend quite a distance away from it - so while they have a high population on paper, most of it is pretty suburban or rural."
3351,"The metro area has struggled to maintain a supply of vaccines to meet demand for months, while rural areas have seen less uptake."
3352,"Oregon was one of the earliest states to see a case, so the response was heavy as they didn't know what we were dealing with at the time."
3353,"Those measures worked well in stopping spread, so that is what they default to when spread increases - though I would suggest that 300 cases a day at this point is not the mark to be doing so."
3354,Hospital and ICU beds are kinda close to capacity but not critically so.
3355,"I also expect this to be just a two-week statistical blip before cases trend downwards, but we'll see how that pans out."

3360,"My city is doing that, handing out gift cards, sites open all day with no appointments needed, it’s available at local pharmacies, workplaces are offering gift cards, Kristi Kreme is giving free donuts for a year, vax has been open to all 16+ for a month...

And we’re at 50% People are not getting it."
3361,A lot of people (half my coworkers/most of my friends’ parents) are ADAMANTLY not getting it.
3362,"I know one person who’s waiting until after her baby comes in a few days, which I can kind of understand (although I would’ve made a different choice), and one who has bad allergic reactions to things and wants to wait for her doctor’s office to get it to be safe."
3363,"I hope that both of them go through with it, but it’s not a guarantee... the pregnant friend’s husband and family have not gotten it, so I’m wary."
3364,What is that gonna do?
3365,The vaccines work against them.
3366,"Nah, not if you've already gotten the vaccine."
3367,Now that’s what we like to see
3368,Gotta get the booster shot
3369,Vaccines are not 100% effective.
3370,Even vaccinated people can (and some do) get infected.
3371,Vaccination works to protect everyone only if most people are vaccinated.
3372,"Checking vaccine status before admitting people to very crowded places, protects everyone in those places."
3373,"Internationally, many countries require various vaccines as a condition of getting a visa."
3374,"Covid vaccine will just be added to the list of required vaccines, for people who want to travel to those places."
3375,Very nice
3376,Right.
3377,So we're somehow going to fully vaccinate another 45% of the population in 2 months?
3378,There we go
3379,They *just* opened it up to people 40+ in my neck of the woods a couple weeks ago and my elderly parents were vaccinated only two weeks ago.
3380,I'm getting the vaccine in about 11 days.
3381,I was honestly expecting it to happen in August after seeing how slow the rollout was just a month ago
3382,"Personally we're only socializing outside still, and we have our kids wear masks still -- and I wear a mask too as additional protection for their sake and to be in solidarity."
3383,It's still fun and my kids don't seem to care at all.
3384,"I wear KN95 or KF-94 to work so a standard surgical style mask is like nothing at all, anyway."
3385,"They started with “screw masks and lockdowns, the only thing that works is vaccines” and ended with “meh, I’ll wait and see”."
3386,Yep.
3387,I imagine a lot of people are waiting for it to be super easy and convenient.
3388,Yeah that seems silly.
3389,"Even last year, in April at higher paranoid levels of covid, I would feel ok at 15 feet outside."
3390,I'd just run faster at the time 😉.

3396,[removed]
3397,I'm not entirely sure what you're trying to say?
3398,I can understand people who don't get the vaccine at all far more than those who skip the second dose.
3399,"I don't know, maybe it's just my ""if it's worth doing then it's worth doing right"" mentality generally."
3400,Oh yeah I just meant If they all got it in mid February when spring training started

3422,Fucking feeble-minded bullshit.
3423,"Let’s be honest here, you can never get 100% of the US citizens to take the vaccines even if children can also get it."
3424,I think yes they’re made in the US but they haven’t all been made yet.
3425,I think the closed Baltimore plant was supposed to make a lot but obviously they had issues so I’m not sure when they’ll be made
3426,We are not going to be at 75-80% by July.
3427,"For starters, kids under the age of 12 will probably not have access until August or September."
3428,"Second, at the rate people accepting vaccinations are dropping, we'll be extremely lucky to be at 55% by the end of May, and we're currently at, what, 43%?"

3441,"No, thats’s a load of crap."
3442,"Here is the FDA website information on EUAs rather than a private website:

3443,An EUA doesn’t mean that all trials are done and it “just lets them start manufacturing earlier”.
3444,"It means, and I quote from the FDA:

“Under an EUA, FDA may allow the use of unapproved medical products, or unapproved uses of approved medical products in an emergency to diagnose, treat, or prevent serious or life-threatening diseases or conditions when certain statutory criteria have been met, including that there are no adequate, approved, and available alternatives."
3445,"Taking into consideration input from the FDA, manufacturers decide whether and when to submit an EUA request to FDA.”

According to the FDA, Covid-19 vaccine trials are still ongoing."
3446,"The TSA is sending a message that if someone is an anti-masker or doesn't want to fly until mask mandates are removed, they shouldn't book travel for the summer travel season."
3447,"Similarly, they're sending a message that if someone is being cautious about COVID and is uncomfortable booking travel unless a mask mandate remains in place, they are saying that people can book travel for the summer travel season with confidence that a mask mandate will be in place."
3448,"If you don't put this stake in the ground, someone's going to book travel for August and be unhappy."
3449,"Airlines also make decisions based on seasons;  changing things midstream in the middle of the summer travel season would come with lots of challenges related to staff training, signage, onboard announcements, etc."
3450,The fact that past vaccines have typically not caused long-term negative side-effects is not evidence that these vaccines won’t either.
3451,"It gives us an indication of what to expect, but we still need the evidence to demonstrate it in the case of both these new vaccines."
3452,That’s particularly true for the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines because mRNA vaccines are essentially a brand new technology.
3453,These are the first mRNA vaccines licensed for use in humans in the US - we don’t know whether this delivery mechanism will result in long term side effects because we’ve never used it in humans before.
3454,It’s not like mRNA is a harmless delivery mechanism.
3455,A quick look at the RNA vaccine Wikipedia page will tell you that mRNA delivery into cells can cause really serious side effects in animal models.
3456,"We haven’t seen those yet with these vaccines, but to pretend that we totally understand them and that we know that the vaccines are completely safe long-term is disingenuous."
3457,"I think they probably are safe, but the honest answer is that we don’t know."
3458,"When people decide to take the vaccines, they are guaranteeing their exposure to something that carries an unknown risk of long-term harm."
3459,"If they decide not to, they have a less than 100% chance of catching Covid, which also carries a risk of long term harm (risk depends on age and pre-existing conditions)."
3460,They can actually make the risk of contracting Covid pretty low if they are very careful.
3461,"To some people, the guarantee of exposing themselves to the unknown risk of the vaccine may just not be worth protecting themselves against a that they already have highly effective ways to protect themselves from."
3462,"I think the vaccines look like a much better bet than risking Covid, and I don’t want to have to hide from the virus indefinitely, but that’s certainly not a decision I would feel comfortable taking away from someone else."

3470,"I can tell you are being intellectually honest, I appreciate that."
3471,Let me ask you a broader question if I may.
3472,I notice a trend in this sub of skepticism towards anything that would warrant more caution or that things are worse with the virus than we thought before.
3473,"Good news about the virus is ok and upvoted, bad news is questionable and downvoted."
3474,"Maybe it is empathy fatigue, plain optimism, suspicion of the media’s profit motive, suspicion of fear mongering, to help argue to open up the economy, or something I don’t understand."
3475,"But for me, I notice a continual underestimation of the virus by the public not an overestimation."
3476,"When I read this article, I think ok, this is evidence two shots are better than one and I move on."
3477,I take it at face value.
3478,"Yes, we can poke holes in the study, but I guess my question is why?"
3479,Have you felt misled by the media on this topic?
3480,Okay if you say so but that means you'll be on here all the time and you must be mentally ill
3481,No.
3482,"It's a function of your body and the virus, not the newness of the virus."

3486,Just had indoor seating for restaurants shut down again today.

3515,It doesn’t seem you understand how any of these vaccines work
3516,If you say so.
3517,So send me the 5k
3518,That's...it?
3519,And you truly think that isn’t weird at all?
3520,If people want to get the vaccine I’m all for it but buying only vaccinated students/staff tickets and apple products for a weekly drawing is kinda odd and I might even go as far as to say suspicious.
3521,I’m gonna do more research into the vaccine and it’s long term usage (which currently none of us know about) before I get it.
3522,What informed decision?
3523,No one knows what will happen in four months - either they've arbitrarily decided four months no matter what the circumstances are (should we be wearing masks if there are 100 cases/day?)
3524,or they'll be evaluating along the way (as they should) in which case this isn't actually informing anyone of anything.
3525,And insane 😅

3544,I'm certainly not defending the previous administration or saying they're exactly the same.
3545,"100 days for masks is *very* similar to this - it was never intended as a finish line, and everyone saw it and assumed it would be way longer."
3546,"Just like ""two weeks to slow the spread"" ""hold out a few more weeks for vaccines"" or any language around how any restrictions would last."
3547,"This is the same - they say four months, people think that means six, or eight."
3548,"You've got a lot of faith in this administration, and that's fine."
3549,"But people have lost faith, and this kind of thing doesn't help."
3550,The NC governor said if the state hits 60% I think then the mask mandate will he lifted.
3551,It really doesn't seem to be having much impact.
3552,I'm not sure what the immunity levels are like but if it is outdoors it's going to be pretty safe vaccine or not

3569,Permitting something but then discouraging it is the dumbest and most confusing approach.
3570,The CDC has misstepped every step of the way.
3571,"Conversations and political pressure for expanding test criteria, no recommendations to stockpile, minimal uniform safety standards for emergency responders, not providing for quarantine, eviction bans have no teeth, no federal standards, not testing wildlife, not counting reinfections, allowing hospitals to close, overworking health care workers, the dumb initial quarantine guidelines, a lack of funding, and refusing early releases of nonviolent offenders, ICE imprisonment, etc..."
3572,The Center for Disease Control has opted against controlling the disease as evidenced by the number of outbreaks it's policies have spread.
3573,You’re obsessed with me aren’t you 🤣🤣
3574,"The vaccine is less than 100% effective so yes infections, hospitalizations, and deaths have occurred and will continue amongst fully vaccinated people."

3623,I would remind the nervous patients to keep breathing and it gave them something to concentrate on.
3624,That seemed to help a lot.
3625,"Lol, how much do you want to bet people will look at you like some weirdo?"
3626,The challenge technically will just be whether vaccine registration was centralized well and if the APIs that can be called to verify the barcode is legit work well.
3627,The challenge legally will be how this doesn't violate HIPA protections.
3628,"I mean it took 3 weeks for my parents (over 55) to even get registered and another month to get the first shot, then 7 weeks to get the second shot."
3629,My other aunts and uncles haven’t had luck getting the vaccine.
3630,My parents have been fortunate.
3631,Apparently there’s a shortage of the second dose and no one is able to get them.
3632,My in-laws and parents went to about 10-15 places before they found a place that would give them the second dose.

3658,Paying people to get a vaccine offered under an EUA is a terrible idea.
3659,At best they could do some kind of requirement or incentive for vaccination once its actually gone through the proper standard approval process.
3660,"Nice PR ""effort"" without the vaccines and infrastructures in place for mass vaccination."
3661,They should impose a lockdown right now to limit the spread... Then create proper infrastructure for mass vaccination.

3671,They've let their guard down.
3672,They've forgotten that the reason you control the virus is to buy time until you get vaccinated.
3673,To me these countries seem really vulnerable to these new more contagious variants of the virus.

3723,I.e it falls within the margin of error of the Sinovac results.
3724,The same AZ results you're citing now is being blasted by the FDA so I'll wait until the final data is released.
3725,Not to mention it's in a different country that's not say quite a bit closer a country where variants are spreading like wild (Brazil).

3728,No.
3729,Clearly after vaccines have been widely accepted/administered and numbers drop and stay dropped I will know this is an unlikely eventuality - but because I’m not fragile and believe in science/reality I will always make room for the fact that the virus may mutate into something that evades vaccines.
3730,As time goes on and transmission lowers this will be more and more unlikely.
3731,The rate doesn’t matter.

3774,"Were you following guidelines then, too?"
3775,"If your lifestyle hasn't changed, you're clearly capable of re-infection."
3776,"Keep in mind that other deaths actually go down during lockdowns, it was visible in some countries that dealt with the virus well."
3777,"For example flu deaths are near zero, car accidents in some countries are down too."
3778,Time to get the tranq darts and blowguns.
3779,We cannot reasonably be expected to shoot our entire society in the foot because a few million gullible cretins read a mendacious conspiracy theory on 4Chan.
3780,Time to stop asking people to get vaccinated.

3782,A bit higher than you remember eh?
3783,You said it was just better than nothing.
3784,Quite an euphemism for making up total nonsense.

3787,!
3788,"No, I'm asking if you're going to spend the rest of your life worried about the next variant."
3789,"If not, when do you stop?"
3790,Read Derek Lowe and Carl Bergstrom’s  comments on same topic.
3791,Very eye opening.
3792,"India opened vaccinations to all adults Saturday, launching a huge inoculation effort that was sure to tax the limits of the federal government, the country’s vaccine factories and the patience of its 1.4 billion people."
3793,"I had no weird antivax anxiety for my second shot today, but I was anxious about getting some sort of allergic reaction and needing them to epipen me or something, even though the chances of that happening especially on my second shot are incredibly small."
3794,Felt better after 30 minutes and my throat wasn't closing up.
3795,heyyyyy five colleges!
3796,That’s me!
3797,I’m assuming I can now heal people with my touch.
3798,Also weird that they arbitrarily picked 2ys.

3802,Stimulus and eviction moratorium did.
3803,Do I stop?
3804,Do I stop what?
3805,The virus?
3806,I guess when I’ve “had enough” like some of you folk I’ll just arbitrarily decide it’s no longer a threat 🤷🏻‍♂️
3807,Its a coronavirus.
3808,Currently there are four that are endemic in humans and cause 'colds'.
3809,The youngest of them very well [may have been](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1889%E2%80%931890_pandemic) the Russian flu of 1890.
3810,Odds on that Covid circulates another 2-3 years as a thing but then it fades into our common pool of what we all call colds as population resistance to it is gained.
3811,I got my first post-covid haircut today and it felt amazing.
3812,In July there will be a new variant.
3813,There will be new variants forever.
3814,At what point do you stop?
3815,It helps if you keep your arm *completely limp* while they administer.
3816,I used to hold my arm up and not even realize it.
3817,You gotta basically pretend you dislocated your shoulder.
3818,"We've been getting a million a week for the last couple months, so literally doubling"
3819,Even if a variant is far more virulent than the previous one it still takes a few months to reach significant share of all infections.
3820,It being here a couple to a few weeks means absolutely nothing from a practical perspective.
3821,This variant is not having any real world impact right now.
3822,I got a flu shot once from an old pharmacist literally days from retirement who kept shaking and squelching the needle around while it was inside me and took forever to push on the plunger.
3823,It made my skin crawl but somehow it wasn't painful at all until an hour later where it felt like I was punched.
3824,"They already did, sinopharm and sinovac."
3825,"Besides the cdc card, my other proof would be my insurance claim records from rite aid for the two shots."
3826,"Doubt science at this age, you must be a fucking ape"
3827,I really don't.
3828,"I keep looking at my mobile because I'm picking up GF inna bit, then I see a notification to respond to."
3829,"I'm working on this extra credit bash script assignment, so I am easily getting pulled away."
3830,"I definitely shouldn't be allocating time to this, but here I am."
3831,"Hey, but if you can be any help, lemme know please."
3832,I also have a fear of new medications.
3833,I panic with each new one and also wait until I HAVE to have it to agree to take it.
3834,I’m getting older and I’m going to need medication for type 2 diabetes.
3835,I tried it in the past snd still don’t know if I had a panic attack or crashed out from it.
3836,Have you found any ways to cope?
3837,"Damn, I'm 25 and I get flu shots every year and I still can't look at the needle."
3838,At least now I can sit down calmly and only feel dread once the needle is actually in their hand.
3839,Just got my second Pfizer today.

3862,Even more so for kids that will have met the virus during childhood!
3863,"Just to offset some fear that people might have about getting the 2nd shot, I had my 2nd shot of the Pfizer vaccine a few weeks ago and I only had a mild fever for 8 hours and that was it."
3864,From the article “Voting in the most recent local elections was largely completed before the scale of the new surge in infections became apparent.” Here you have it.
3865,"They will, but immunity from the mRNA vaccines is supposed to be stronger and wider (focuses on the spike in it's pre-fusion form) which is important as some variants escape natural immunity."
3866,That being said that's taken into account and natural immunity *does* and *will* help.
3867,Those who don't want to get vaccinated will catch the disease and develop natural immunity.
3868,"Even though it might be not as strong as the immunity from the vaccine, most of those who have been sick once will only develop mild symptoms the second time."
3869,Hospital saturation will likely be avoided.
3870,The EU has done way more than the US in this regard.
3871,What?
3872,Why?
3873,"At this point, if I were India, I would accept anything."
3874,"From Pfizer, J&amp;J, AZ, SinoVac, Sputnik."
3875,Just anything I could my hands on
3876,"I think it's as you said:
&gt; As i understand this facility is doing the wrapping of the vaccine with lipids part only."
3877,Back in February BioNTech said lipids were the biggest bottleneck.
3878,Today with more lipid production this new factory really could mean 50M more shots on top unless there is another bottleneck we haven't yet heard about.
3879,"Exponential spread

&gt;A forum of scientific advisers set up by Modi administration warned Indian officials in early March of a new and more contagious variant of the coronavirus taking hold in the country, five scientists who are part of the forum told Reuters."
3880,"&gt;Despite the warning, four of the scientists said the federal government did not seek to impose major restrictions to contain the spread of the virus."
3881,"Millions, largely unmasked, attended religious gatherings and election rallies that were held by Modi, leaders of the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party and opposition politicians."
3882,I feel that they'll push it as much as they can to not waste doses and rather ban it for under 35s but just before allowing them to sign up as to not affect rates of vaccination in those over 35
3883,"Makes sense, but many people have been contaminated but either don't know they have been in contact with the virus (asymptomatic) or can't prove it and will have two doses..."
3884,Your symptoms might have been more serious without this first shot.
3885,How sick have you been?
3886,"“Fauci cited numerous scientific studies, including a Centers for Disease Control and Prevention report published Wednesday that found the Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna Covid-19 vaccines are 64% effective at preventing hospitalizations in the elderly after one shot, but 94% effective after two doses.”

I guess this is the reason."
3887,Some people probably don’t want go through double the hassle for that extra 30%.
3888,Do they even count/test the “untouchables”?
3889,India thought ivermectin and HCQ worked.
3890,They don’t.

3912,"That's most of my Hispanic and black friends, sadly."
3913,"They figure that USA is doing good now, so they don't need to take it."
3914,We legitimately know the side effects from the virus.
3915,Is this the UK variant or a unique indian variant ?
3916,Isn't it May now?
3917,Well what changes is that you are vaccinated... Do you think the entire state is just waiting for you to get the shot?
3918,"At least you've done what you can, and if enough people do what they can, we have a much better shot at this."
3919,No one is trying to punish people with lock downs.
3920,We're trying to keep everyone safe.
3921,Ask India about what really not safe looks like.
3922,"&gt; There's lot of things to be proud about, but Canada's handling of the vaccine isn't really one."
3923,I feel the same way about the EU.
3924,"I love the EU and most things about it, but vaccine rollout was not one of them."
3925,But we live and we learn.
3926,Hopefully in the future we will do better.
3927,Same in Portugal.
3928,do you really he comprehends just how much he’s on the wrong side.
3929,these people are confidently stupid through and through
3930,In my country the recommendation made by health authorities is that those with previous infection should receive only one dose six months after recovery.

3943,"Yes, and the big advantage of Astrazeneca is that it can be stored at fridge temperature."
3944,So it's easy to deliver to remote places.
3945,IMO masks should stay until the end of the year.
3946,It only makes sense.
3947,Especially with new variants probably coming over from places like India and Brazil.
3948,But everything else should return to normal.
3949,Or it’s just a little flu
3950,This happened with my first shot and I was really worried it was going to happen again with my second and I couldn't find anything to reassure me.
3951,"Shot 2 I made sure to stay hydrated during the day, ate a snack before leaving, and kept a cold bottle of water with me that I put on my face after the shot and I had no reaction at all."

3967,He didn't lie whatsoever.
3968,UK has an outright ban.
3969,All vaccines are contractually procured specifically to the UK.

3971,Of which UK has an contractual ban in effect.
3972,The mental gymnastics are increasingly becoming creative.
3973,Starbucks!
3974,👀
3975,If they even have the testing capacity to verify it.
3976,Pfizer shipments alone in May equal to the total vaccinations given in April.
3977,"Add in any extra Moderna, Janssen, Astra or additional approvals and Canada is well on the way."
3978,"Wait, so the US are just allowing anyone who can get the vaccine to get it then, no matter age or health problems?"
3979,Kind of screws any foreign students who's countries are during it by age.
3980,And there’s still people that believe the virus doesn’t exist.
3981,HOLY SHIT
3982,UK strategy has been the best strategy.
3983,The data is overwhelmingly positive.
3984,"i got my second pfizer sunday and to be honest, it wasn't bad at all."
3985,Some muscle ache but nothing terrible.
3986,I took the day off and hammed it up but tbh I could've worked all the same.
3987,Freedom!!!!!!
3988,Lmao they're going to require us all to take a vaccine..
3989,Human beings haven't fundamentally changed during recorded history.
3990,"Education and science has helped us tremendously as a species, but individually we are no different psychologically than those people we look down upon."

3993,"It tends to do wonders in the limited field of expertise, but it's not a cure-all for all illogical and nonsensical thinking."
3994,"I've studied and worked with really smart and highly educated people, and they believe in some really stupid and superstitious stuff."
3995,"We're not fundamentally creatures of logic, so it is incredibly dangerous to assume individuals act logically in all situations, just because they manage to do it in one area of their lives."
3996,Would you say the country would reach herd immunity faster if there was no restrictions at all?
3997,A ton of deaths though..
3998,"There is a statement by the developer, and they also linked it on the twitter account, maybe you have missed it."
3999,The quotas aren't so different.
4000,"Canada has administered more first jabs, Germany more second jabs, but the number of doses are nearly identical."
4001,"Germany has an older population, that might be another factor why it takes longer to vaccinate the older age brackets."
4002,Damn.
4003,"67% efficacy is less than 95% efficacy, or are you simply in denial?"
4004,I don't vote; but people are probably down voting because of Canada being the worst in the world for vaccines.
4005,It turns out we are pretty not bad.
4006,"Not as good as the US, UK, or Israel."
4007,"But ahead of the EU , and all other developed countries."
4008,We are doing pretty fine.
4009,Depending on how May goes we could race the US to 70% of adults with a first shot.
4010,"The delayed first shot is a risk, but since we weren't giving a pile of first doses when we started last month and the UK is ahead of us, we can pivot again if the science bears it out."
4011,Canada is on pace to be the 3rd G20 country to vaccinate our way out of the pandemic.
4012,Our land border will probably be opened by Independence Day to vaccinated Americans.
4013,These are all things that we would have hoped for at best last September.

4020,I could see the messaging pivoting to “take one for the team” since it seems younger people have the worst side effects.

4025,"Honestly it's really useful to be trained out of a fear of needles, it makes it so much easier to get any required injections or blood tests done and I don't risk my health over trying to avoid needles"
4026,Pretty sure your freedom will be okay with minor encumbrances - such as wearing a mask - if you know that your job will go if you don't.
4027,"And as of today anyone between 18-55yo with chronic illnesses (from a published list, estimated 4.5 millon people) can get a pfizer/moderna jab."
4028,"Yea we just went a few weeks ago (we scheduled the trip in January 2020, and decided to keep it last fall thinking things would be better by April... we were right, but barely lol)."
4029,"While we're vaccinated already, it was really great to see the compliance they're enforcing."

4037,"Tbh, I voluntarily made myself feel worse for fun drinking in my 20s then the shot made me feel, and getting high never made me immune to sickness."
4038,You can't count deaths on the same day as new infections.
4039,Deaths lag infection by at least 2 weeks.
4040,"If I read it correctly the nation is not losing 2 people/ hour but Maharashtra, the hardest hit area is"
4041,waiting for the second dose in 4 months will be fucking long and i hope it wont negate the effect the first dose have after a month.

4100,wb cc’s?
4101,How come for the past year people kept mentioning “we don’t know the long term effects of Covid” but people can’t apply that same thought to the vaccines?
4102,I just find that interesting.
4103,And I’m vaccinated so don’t even go there.
4104,Definitely the right thing and I'm wondering if vaccines made in the United States under Pfizer alongside main biontech facility in Mainz Germany shipped to India.
4105,Do you have the article?
4106,Pls share.

4169,"Same goes for most symptoms of ""long COVID."""
4170,I was very needle phobic as a child.
4171,I would count down the days until my next jab even if they were a year+ away.
4172,I got over it as an adult but for my entire childhood every time I needed to get a vaccine was panic city in the weeks leading up to it.
4173,"I didn't want my kids to feel that way so from the very beginning it was always very matter of fact, explaining what would happen in a calm voice even when they were infants too young to understand, slight amounts of distraction, immediate hugs and then some kind of reward for being brave after."
4174,They are 4 and 6 now and vaccines have literally never been a problem for them.
4175,"We talk about how it might pinch like a quick bee sting and the area might be sore for a little while after, but we explain WHY they get each shot so they feel like it's worth it."
4176,"And then we go get to pick a prize or treat, very exciting!"
4177,"We always let them know ahead of time when they will be getting a jab so it's not a last minute unpleasant surprise, but not so far ahead that they dwell on it for too long."
4178,"At this point the 4 year old opted to get her kindergarten vaccines as soon as she could vs waiting until her next physical, and both kids are actually looking forward to their Covid vaccines when they become available because they know it means the world will be one step closer to normal."
4179,I don't know if they are just naturally less anxious than I was or if how we've handled it with them has helped but I'm so glad they aren't traumatized by going to the doctor's like I used to be as a kid.
4180,Instead they hype themselves up for being brave which makes me so relieved that I don't have to be the parent dragging screaming kids through the waiting room towards their doom.
4181,"And yet you got the virus, so evidently there are limitations to the precautions you’re taking."
4182,Yep... Jealous of all the other countries vaccinating younger people

4204,Gotta spend that enormous defense budget.
4205,I know but you’ll have a lot more drop outs if it’s months after and the whole country seems to have gotten over it
4206,Germany already has a bigger plant than this.
4207,"The Marburg plant is cranking out around 80 million doses a month, making it the biggest one in the world."
4208,EU pfizer production is reaching stupidly high levels.
4209,Unless I’m missing something we’re well over 150m doses of pfizer/biontech being made per month in the EU now.
4210,"There are also plenty of “willing but lazy” people who will get it, but aren’t eager enough for it to go too far out of their way or to rearrange their schedule."
4211,We always welcome Canadians.
4212,But it's less effective and doesn't last as long as vaccinated immunity.
4213,Hope you didn’t pay much.
4214,"We don’t know how many of the recovered have gotten vaccinated—it could be all, part, or almost none so we’d still be guessing at what number it would be."
4215,There’s also the possibility of natural infection not being as effective against new variants.

4220,We clearly have enough information at this point.
4221,"From what I understand, Covid has much less of a risk of mutating from animal reservoirs compared to the flu which is why they have to change the formula every year."
4222,My guess is the vaccine gives your immune system way more targets to attack than a typical exposure.
4223,"The idea of the vaccine is the virus is dealing with specific immunity right off the bat and can't get rolling, which means not many virus particles."
4224,No.
4225,Don't do that.
4226,Nobody mentions that because it's not a concern.
4227,People have become hospitalized and died from covid despite full vaccination.

4240,Nice logic.
4241,If you were that concerned you should have just gotten an mRNA first.
4242,There’s no reason to get another one now.
4243,J&amp;J eventually reaches the same efficacy it just takes a bit longer.
4244,"So, I've been trying to parse the meaning of the study itself rather than just of the reporting on it, and I have some questions."
4245,1.
4246,"I freely acknowledge that representative sampling is an important and useful tool, but should this study's sample size of only 51 people really be enough to justify the kind of sweeping claims a lot of the reporting on this is making?"
4247,2.
4248,"Those 51 people are all healthcare workers, and so presumably at heightened risk of infection compared to many in the general population."
4249,How applicable are these results outside of that context?
4250,3.
4251,"The lower levels of resistance being reported are just that: low**er**, not non-existent."
4252,"I don't think anyone would dispute that receiving both doses is going to produce a more effective response, and it would certainly seem that prior infection operates in much the same way."
4253,"Is it actually fair to say that the single dose leaves people ""vulnerable"" when in fact it actually increases their protection but not by as much as two doses or infection plus a dose?"
4254,"This vulnerability is relative, after all."
4255,4.
4256,"As nobody among the 51 people evaluated in the study actually ended up getting infected during the course of the period surveyed, what weight should we place on claims of the inadequacy of the first dose when within the study itself nobody got infected, and within the vast petri dish of the UK's broader roll-out its effectiveness in halting the spread of the B.1.1.7 variant in particular seems impossible to dispute?"
4257,I am far more ready to believe that a difference found between two cohorts among 51 people is insignificant or incomplete than that the predominant single-dose approach to the whole adult British population has succeeded only by a series of millions of flukes.
4258,"I have no doubt that there are elements of this that I don't understand as well as I should, and that's why I'm asking."
4259,"The need for more science specialists who are also trained in producing accurate plain-language summaries has never been greater than it is now, and the gulf between the reporting and data in study after study is an important reason why."
4260,"We've been burned by that before, so I don't have much choice but to make inquiries about it here too."
4261,"Still not confirmed but hopefully, we desperately need help in Mexico!"
4262,[removed]
4263,"I have an extreme fear of needles, hospitals, and doctors offices in general (including the dentist)."
4264,"When I was 1.5years, I had to have my stomach pumped."
4265,"When I was 5, my dentist ripped out a loose tooth without my consent and without asking my parents (we switched dentists after that)
When I was 7, I had a spinal tap (hense needle fear)
When I was 13, I had a nurse jab me with a vaccination needle FIVE TIMES before realizing the needle was crooked and that's why the vaccine wasn't coming out of it."
4266,I then had to have 3 additional vaccines immediately after and all of this happened in the same arm.
4267,I couldn't move my arm for 5 days.
4268,I dont remember most of those things happening (trauma literally removed the last one from my memory) but I KNOW they all contribute to my fears
4269,Almost 7 million _reported_ cases in India this month alone.
4270,Only if the virus is logical.
4271,It's just as possible it is similarly lethal or moreso due to its long incubation period

4289,it's just a resource i have seen mentioned elsewhere and thought might be useful here as well.
4290,"So, I think they can stop hoarding and blocking vaccine exports to other countries then?"
4291,I wonder how the laws work around this.
4292,"It is different to require a student to get a vaccine than an employee, especially if the employees are represented by a union."
4293,"Remember the vaccines are still only EUA, so legally requiring an employee to get it is probably a little tricky."
4294,"This I think is why so many schools (like K-12, not colleges) would not open last year, because the school system couldn't require the teachers to get the vaccine."
4295,I get 40 hours of PTO a year.
4296,Using 8 of those hours for the side effects of the second dose was a tough pill for me to swallow and I don't blame those who chose to use those hours for family or vacation.
4297,lotta people in shittier situations than I'm in as well.
4298,Telling people they need to get the second shot (or even the first shot) without providing any sort of mandatory leave time must be some sort of sick joke.

4334,Wow.
4335,They still immunize you against smallpox?
4336,Your risk of catching COVID and suffering its long-term effects are much higher than your risk of having long-term side effects from the vaccine.
4337,I’ve asked some of them “what do you understand to be the difference between the two?”   Most say more and longer trials.
4338,When I explain the differences And that it’s not about trials I think most realize the stuff that still needs to be accomplished to get fda licensure are not really things they care about.
4339,They think we cut the trials short by a year or something.

4341,The short answer is no.
4342,"Once you get the vaccine, you most likely won't experience any flu-like symptoms or any symptoms at all if you are exposed to the virus."
4343,That is what the vaccine does.

4366,"Then literally the day that my 2nd kid got their first shot, all of a sudden shots are available all day every day at 10 places within 5 miles."
4367,"I got my first shot on 3/31 and waited about 45 minutes, 2nd shot on 4/22 and I almost walked right up to the nurse."
4368,I think we crossed peak demand for the vaccine in mid-April.
4369,"However, we are still doing pretty good with about 2 million shots per day."
4370,says who?
4371,Israel reached what they believe is herd immunity with 56% vaccinations and 15% of people recovered.
4372,"You can get immunity from being exposed to the virus too, which is how herd immunity happens without a vaccine."

4389,They say that 80% of people age 65+ have taken it but I guess that leaves 20%...
4390,"The danger is that the longer it spreads in india, the more bodies the virus can test for mutation that can escape vaccine immunity."
4391,Then we have to do this globally all over again in 1 or 2 years.

4449,I've read elsewhere that the response was up to 50 times higher.
4450,Vaccine centers are facing accute shortage of vaccines after suddenly 18+ group was made eligible for vaccination.

4459,"It's owned by BioNTech in Germany, and yes"
4460,"Well guys, we had a good run."
4461,What the fuck are you talking about?
4462,You're really clueless.
4463,I'm literally saying that the US and EU are both equally responsible in blocking the **patent rights waiver** that would benefit the entire world right now.

4482,"Also, the researchers themselves say that the answer is more vaccination just with a different attack point."
4483,Yes.
4484,I don’t see why that’s a problem?
4485,It’s an important piece of information.
4486,"It’s terrible of course that people don’t take their second dose for maximum and longer protection, but a much larger problem is people skipping their first dose."
4487,Obviously you've not read the recent articles about the manufacturing contamination in the second-shot Sputnik vaccine (the first shot uses a different adenovirus than the second).
4488,"Though not a threat to most, it is dangerous for immune-compromised people."
4489,There has also been complaints by countries that the Sputnik vaccines being shipped are different from the ones used in trials.

4494,the sleeping part was nice and kind of took advantage of it because i can have bouts of insomnia these last few years.
4495,I’m talking about long term effects of any vaccine 10 years down the line.
4496,Are you making circular arguments on purpose?
4497,The point is no vaccine has shown issues of long term effects.
4498,Why?
4499,Because it works on the immune system and effects don’t need 10 years to appear.

4503,24 years old is likely mid/late June.
4504,"Our second doses will be 16 weeks later, which is far from the recommended timeframe."
4505,"There are some exceptions to the age roll out, and those are people in high-outbreak areas who can get a first dose of AstraZeneca, but only if they're aged 40 and up."

4523,"For example, life expectancy in Russia grew from 68 years in 2010 to 73 years in 2019."
4524,Averaging over 10 years negates this change.

4735,"In that case, will getting the vaccine at this point in time help protect him from negative outcomes?"
4736,Or is it too late?
4737,"Alternatively, might there be some sort of reaction between Covid and the vaccine that would, in and of itself, create a new negative outcome, potentially worse than if he hadn't taken the vaccine at all?"

4748,"**Michigan is now hospitalizing more people under 40 than those over 80 for COVID-19**

Dr. Stacey Sensor says her 18-year-old son, a high school senior, is “one of the healthiest people I know.”

“He works out every single day at five o’clock in the morning,” said Sensor, a Gaylord physician."
4749,“He takes all these supplements.
4750,He only eats healthy.
4751,And he got COVID at the gym.
4752,"“He was quite sick for about eight days,” she said."
4753,"“So I’m telling you that it doesn’t matter what supplements you take, what your age is."
4754,...
4755,"Even in the healthiest individual, they still can get it and they can still become very sick and then the effects can be there for quite some time.”

It’s a cautionary tale, she said, for people who see COVID-19 as a serious health threat for the elderly but a much more benign illness for younger, healthier people."
4756,"In fact, Michigan’s current coronavirus surge has turned that assumption on its head: Last week, the state was averaging more hospital admissions for COVID patients under 40 than patients age 80 or older."
4757,"The former was about 78 a day compared to 50 for the latter, according to data from the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services."
4758,"The biggest reason for the demographic shift, experts say: The difference in vaccination rates."
4759,"About 74% of Michigan residents age 70 and older have gotten at least one dose of vaccine, and two-thirds are fully vaccinated."
4760,"For those 16 to 49, the numbers are 36% who have gotten one dose and 23% fully immunized; there is no vaccine authorized for children under 16."
4761,"Also contributing to the surge of virus among young people is the spread of variants that are both more contagious and more lethal; the tendency of many younger adults to disregard COVID-19 guidelines, and the fact that schools have reopened."
4762,"“It’s definitely become more of a young person disease now, probably because they haven’t been vaccinated and they’ve been more likely than older folks to go out and about, be in close contact with others and go to gatherings,” said Dr. Mark Hamed, a physician who is medical director for Huron, Lapeer, Sanilac, Tuscola, Alcona, Iosco, Ogemaw, and Oscoda counties."
4763,The numbers bear that out.
4764,"In the first year of the pandemic, Michigan residents age 60 and older accounted for 23% of cases; it’s now 13%."
4765,"Conversely, those under age 20 accounted for 13% of cases during the first 12 months of the pandemic; it’s now 25%."
4766,"The chart below shows the April case numbers by age group compared to the monthly average through March 2021, as well as compared to December 2020 during the fall surge."
4767,"[Image](https://www.mlive.com/resizer/WNTiwqVd1gGfPM09p2D0qzVgFZY=/1280x0/smart/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/advancelocal/VQGMMSPTZNGADOVJQPKGAWILMQ.PNG)

In theory, that’s actually a welcomed shift from the standpoint that old age is easily the biggest risk factor for being hospitalized or dying of COVID-19."
4768,But experts have been taken aback by the spike in COVID-19 hospitalizations among younger adults and children.
4769,"Compared to the height of the fall surge in early December, Michigan’s average daily hospitalization admissions for COVID-19 are up 33% for those age 18 to 29, 58% for thirty-somethings and 64% for those in their 40s."
4770,"Meanwhile, hospitalizations for those age 80 and older are down 60% compared to December."
4771,"[Image](https://www.mlive.com/resizer/86v1e7Apdm4-zWbHd-9Q7X4rAh0=/1280x0/smart/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/advancelocal/RPEUG3IW5JGXTF6HQYL2RBK67U.png)

“It’s like, you take what we were seeing before and shift it down by one or two decades,” said Dr. Joel Fishbain, an infectious disease specialist for Beaumont Hospital in Grosse Pointe."
4772,"“We’ve got 20-year-olds who are getting admitted, and 30-year-olds requiring oxygen, which we never saw before, and needing as much treatment as we can give them."
4773,"We’ve got 40- and 50-year-olds ending up on ventilators.”

Pediatric cases also are up."
4774,"Last week, the state was averaging almost 10 hospital admissions a day among pediatric patients with COVID-19, triple the number in mid-February."
4775,"Deaths among children and younger adults have spiked, too."
4776,"In the first 13 months of the pandemic, there were six deaths among children ages 10 to 19."
4777,"In the past month, four deaths were reported."
4778,"Another 65 deaths were reported in April for 20- and 30-somethings, quadruple the monthly average."
4779,The chart below compares April deaths to the monthly average through March 2021 as well as to confirmed COVID deaths in December.
4780,The numbers show how deaths among seniors plummeted in April compared to December as a result of vaccinations while coronavirus variants spiked deaths among unvaccinated people under age 50.
4781,"[Image](https://www.mlive.com/resizer/caQyJGE9C2BiswUM2ThU22RJumk=/1280x0/smart/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/advancelocal/ZXCIGC7VWZCN7H65ULFSFE4GPI.PNG)

Deaths and hospitalizations aren’t the only concern."
4782,"While most COVID patients under age 50 “don’t get severely ill, there are a growing number of people who have long-haul COVID symptoms,” said Dr. Liam Sullivan, an infectious disease specialists with Spectrum Health in Grand Rapids."
4783,"“They have problems with smelling, with taste, with concentration, with memory, with fatigue, with night sweats."
4784,"“So even though they had a mild illness the first time around, they’re still dealing with these things month and months later, and that’s not something you want to deal with when you’re 25 or 35,” he said."
4785,"“Of course, you don’t want to deal with it at any age, but especially when you’re in the prime of your life.”

And for women, the research is growing on the dangers of COVID-19 during pregnancy."
4786,"Dr. Kurt Wharton, an Oakland County obstetrician, currently has four pregnant patients in intensive care units battling COVID-19."
4787,"All four are “fighting for their lives,” said Wharton, who works at Beaumont Hospital in Royal Oak."
4788,"While COVID-19-related deaths among pregnant women remain very rare, Wharton and others say the evidence is growing that coronavirus during pregnancy can put a woman at a much higher risk of preterm birth, preeclampsia and admission to the ICU and/or intubation, especially if the woman has pre-existing conditions such as high blood pressure, obesity, diabetes or heart disease."
4789,"Evidence growing on COVID-19 vaccines during pregnancy: Virus is dangerous; the shots are not

Doctors offer several theories on why more younger people are getting significantly ill with COVID-19 in the current surge."
4790,"One is the spread of variants, which are both more contagious and more lethal."
4791,"The variants are “stickier,” Hamed said, which means it takes less exposure to make someone severely ill or even symptomatic."
4792,Wharton noted the same pattern happened during the 1918 influenza pandemic.
4793,The initial surge in the spring of 1918 primarily impacted the elderly and babies.
4794,"But the virus mutated and came roaring back in the fall of 1918, and its primary victims during that surge were younger adults."
4795,"“History is repeating itself,” Wharton said."
4796,"Another issue, suggests Hamed and others: More unvaccinated people are gathering in groups without masks."
4797,"That increases the risk of exposure to a higher viral load, which has been associated with more severe disease."
4798,"“The best mask you wear, the less viral load you inhale,” Wharton said."
4799,"On top that, many schools have reopened and children and younger adults in particular are resuming their pre-pandemic social lives."
4800,"“You can see it,” Wharton said."
4801,"“Younger people are all out in groups again, walking down sidewalks, shopping, going to restaurants and bars together."
4802,"They just think they’re invulnerable.”

The good news is that COVID-19 vaccinations have proven “wildly successful” in significantly reducing the chances of getting the virus and spreading to others, Sullivan said."
4803,"And just as vaccinations have blunted spread of the virus among senior citizens, the spread of COVID among younger adults can be stymied through immunization shots."
4804,"Vaccination programs “really need to target the younger people right now,” Sensor said."
4805,“They’re the ones who are getting sick.
4806,"We’ve done a really good job of vaccinating our older population, but to really move forward and get out of this pandemic, we really need our younger people to step up to the plate and get the vaccine to protect themselves and protect their families.”"

4808,All I’ve heard about that situation is that those people still need to get their second dose.
4809,What makes you think I am ignorant?
4810,I just looked up the status of border crossings between the US and Canada.
4811,As expected there is still a ban in my case.
4812,I had really hoped that with the US’ ever increasing vaccination rate + downward trend of cases that Canada would allow more free travel into their country.
4813,"As I am fully vaccinated (yeah this can be faked), I hoped that too could help me to visit Canada."
4814,It doesn’t seem to be the case though.
4815,I’ll just hope that both the US and CA improve in the coming months and that by summer’s end both countries are much more under control.

4854,"The hidden secret is that it seems ""herd immunity"" (I know its not a singular point) starts when about 60%(+/- some) of people have vaccine + natural immunity."
4855,"The US has a TON of natural immunity, something like 25-30%."
4856,"If you assume the low end of that and an even split of natural immunity people getting the vaccine vs those that dont, with 45% of people vaxxed, another 13.75% of people would have natural immunity, for total immunity of 58.75%

But its also not an even split."
4857,Those that have natural immunity are probably LESS likely to get the vaccine (plus kids CANT get the vaccine).
4858,So it wouldnt be shocking once the US hits 45% vax rate that we are close to or over that 60% mark.
4859,The US is currently at ~43.5%.

4884,Which is absurd.
4885,We might as well say that liquor stores don't discriminate based on over/under 21 status because sometimes underage people are able to get themselves alcohol.
4886,I'd also like to see people stop using the average age of hospitalization going down as evidence of an increased danger in young adults.
4887,The entire reason we vaccinated the elderly population as soon as possible was to keep old people from needing to be hospitalized.
4888,The average age of hospitalization better be going down.
4889,If there is an increase in the absolute number of young adults hospitalized that isn't explained by a rise in cases in those age groups in that area then that is the relevant data.

4892,Cases have been in exponential decay and should continue to keep going down.
4893,I would trust the experts on this one who’ve found that vaccines continue to be effective against variants and the likelihood of a variant developing that completely evades vaccines and natural immunity isn’t very high in the short term.
4894,So cases will go down.

&gt;On May 1st:
1."
4937,The Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine has been approved and is just starting to be administered.
4938,2.
4939,"The vaccine is available to anyone who wants one, and can be provided at your local pharmacy."
4940,3.
4941,2 million Americans are being vaccinated per day.
4942,4.
4943,"Restrictions (mask use, distancing, etc.)"
4944,are beginning to be loosened up.
4945,"Large events (concerts, sports games, etc.)"
4946,"have strict limits on attendance (25% capacity and proof of vaccination are required, as is mask use)."
4947,Smaller gatherings are permitted.
4948,Most stores still require masks in order to enter.
4949,"Restaurants, bars, and movie theaters are largely open across the country, but have 25% to 50% capacity limits."
4950,So how did I do?
4951,"Well for starters it looks like the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine will not be approved in the United States, so right away that’s one prediction I did not get right."
4952,As for the others?
4953,I think I did a pretty damn good job.
4954,"The vaccine is currently available to anyone who wants one, and it can be provided at your local pharmacy."
4955,"The 7-day rolling average of vaccine doses being administered per day is about 2.6 million, which is a little above my 2 million prediction."
4956,"However, on January 1st my assumption was that we would still be ramping up the number of doses administered per day by May 1st, not winding down."
4957,"And while I don’t know the level of restrictions in every municipality across the country, I think it’s fair to say that my prediction on the restrictions still in effect is on point."
4958,"Large gatherings (such as sports games) are allowed, with some capacity restrictions in some states."
4959,Small gatherings are allowed across the entire country.
4960,"As far as I’m aware, most stores still require masks to be worn in order for entry."
4961,"And restaurants, bars, and movie theaters are open across the country."
4962,"Lastly, here are the predictions I had made for July 1st:

4970,"Large events (such as sports games, concerts, and festivals) are allowed, but they are limited to 50% capacity, and you will need to show proof of vaccination to attend them."
4971,"However, mask usage is largely not required."
4972,5.
4973,"It’s somewhat common to see mask use out in public, but the masking requirements in most stores have largely been dropped."

4978,4 million Americans are being vaccinated per day.
4979,"When it comes to these predictions, there are four points that I made that I would like to revise."
4980,The first one is point #2.
4981,"As far as I’m aware, there are currently no restrictions on private parties or in-person gatherings anywhere in the United States, meaning this prediction of mine was off by several months."
4982,Even the notoriously risk-averse CDC has allowed for fully vaccinated people from different households to congregate indoors without masks or distancing.
4983,The second one is point #4.
4984,I no longer believe that you will need to show proof of vaccination to attend large events.
4985,"While I think the idea of a vaccine passport will be around for international travel, I can’t say the same about domestic events."
4986,"Ultimately, I think the nature of the American public means that this idea will never really gain traction outside of very limited circumstances."
4987,I also believe that most large events (such as sports games) will be open to 100% capacity across most of the country.
4988,"With NYC announcing an anticipated “100% re-opening” by July 1st, I think it’s safe to say that the country is rapidly moving in the direction of losing its capacity limits in all venues."
4989,The third point is point #6.
4990,"I think it’s clear by now that, much like the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine, the Novavax vaccine will not be getting approved in the United States."
4991,The fourth point is point #7.
4992,"While I increased the number of Americans set to be vaccinated by May 1st, I am revising down my estimate for July 1st."
4993,"By the time July 1st rolls around every person who wants to be vaccinated will be fully vaccinated, as will most people who are somewhat skeptical of the vaccines but ultimately decide to receive them."
4994,"This means that by July 1st the bulk of people who aren’t vaccinated are the people who cannot be vaccinated (such as children), and the people who are steadfastly against vaccination."
4995,"Ultimately, I would expect a pace of around half a million vaccine doses administered a day by July 1st."
4996,"While this may seem like bad news at a first glance, it’s actually great news."
4997,It means that all the people who I believed were going to be vaccinated in June/July will be mostly vaccinated in April/May.

## Summary

### Background

Obesity is a major risk factor for adverse outcomes after infection with SARS-CoV-2."
5100,"We aimed to examine this association, including interactions with demographic and behavioural characteristics, type 2 diabetes, and other health conditions."
5101,"### Methods

In this prospective, community-based, cohort study, we used de-identified patient-level data from the QResearch database of general practices in England, UK."
5102,"We extracted data for patients aged 20 years and older who were registered at a practice eligible for inclusion in the QResearch database between Jan 24, 2020 (date of the first recorded infection in the UK) and April 30, 2020, and with available data on BMI."
5103,"Data extracted included demographic, clinical, clinical values linked with Public Health England's database of positive SARS-CoV-2 test results, and death certificates from the Office of National Statistics."
5104,"Outcomes, as a proxy measure of severe COVID-19, were admission to hospital, admission to an intensive care unit (ICU), and death due to COVID-19."
5105,"We used Cox proportional hazard models to estimate the risk of severe COVID-19, sequentially adjusting for demographic characteristics, behavioural factors, and comorbidities."
5106,"### Findings

Among 6 910 695 eligible individuals (mean BMI 26·78 kg/m2 \[SD 5·59\]), 13 503 (0·20%) were admitted to hospital, 1601 (0·02%) to an ICU, and 5479 (0·08%) died after a positive test for SARS-CoV-2."
5107,"We found J-shaped associations between BMI and admission to hospital due to COVID-19 (adjusted hazard ratio \[HR\] per kg/m2 from the nadir at BMI of 23 kg/m2 of 1·05 \[95% CI 1·05–1·05\]) and death (1·04 \[1·04–1·05\]), and a linear association across the whole BMI range with ICU admission (1·10 \[1·09–1·10\])."
5108,"We found a significant interaction between BMI and age and ethnicity, with higher HR per kg/m2 above BMI 23 kg/m2 for younger people (adjusted HR per kg/m2 above BMI 23 kg/m2 for hospital admission 1·09 \[95% CI 1·08–1·10\] in 20–39 years age group *vs* 80–100 years group 1·01 \[1·00–1·02\]) and Black people than White people (1·07 \[1·06–1·08\] *vs* 1·04 \[1·04–1·05\])."
5109,"The risk of admission to hospital and ICU due to COVID-19 associated with unit increase in BMI was slightly lower in people with type 2 diabetes, hypertension, and cardiovascular disease than in those without these morbidities."
5110,"### Interpretation

At a BMI of more than 23 kg/m2, we found a linear increase in risk of severe COVID-19 leading to admission to hospital and death, and a linear increase in admission to an ICU across the whole BMI range, which is not attributable to excess risks of related diseases."
5111,The relative risk due to increasing BMI is particularly notable people younger than 40 years and of Black ethnicity.
5112,You didn’t need scientists to say that.
5113,We knew.

5127,We already have a few variants that are more resistant to vaccines.

5138,"There have been (baseless) facebook posts circulating saying things like “being around people who have the vaccine can mess with fertility because vaccinated people shed spike proteins” 

The whole thing is complete misinformation, since the virus doesn’t affect fertility of people who received it, let alone people around someone who did."

5261,Does anyone know if the Moderna vaccine protects against these new strains?
5262,I'm planning on going to MI next weekend to see my family and I'm a little scared now.
5263,I'm fully vaccinated and so is my family but I'm a little leery of the plane.
5264,"No, he didn't."
5265,Smart and benevolent decision on the U.S's part.
5266,But are the AstraZeneca vaccines still effective against the Indian variant?
5267,Lol wow I feel bad for this group so afraid to live they are already dead..
5268,How many cases are in china?
5269,I'm confused
5270,COVID has been like a psychology experiment and it’s depressing to see so much misinformation that is mindlessly gobbled up.
5271,"I get that the lies may be easier for people to accept if they don’t want to think critically and use their brains, but some of this crap is so ridiculous that it’s scary to realize a significant portion of people’s brains are fast adopters of it."
5272,"I’ll be curious to see what the long term science is, because I believe that psychologists must be looking at this and studying it in real time."
5273,All the evidence we have so far points towards it very likely not being very vaccine evasive and I think the broad scientific community expectation is that the future data and evidence we collect will continue to support that hypothesis.
5274,"But Germany is one of the richest countries, and Brazil has BOLSONARO as president."
5275,"Germany is doing OK, could be better."
5276,We are all only a variant away from going back to square one.
5277,"Eventually a variant will be more contagious,  more deadly,  and resistant to current vaccines."
5278,"I hope to hell not, but it is definitely a possibility."
5279,Young people have magical thinking.
5280,"My nephew is 27, fit."
5281,"Wound up with pneumonia,  3 blood clots in his lung that may or may not dissolve from meds."
5282,Otherwise require a surgical  procedure  to remove.
5283,a damaged heart valve that will hopefully heal.
5284,"Spent a week in ICU and now needs months of follow up care, meds, and appointments."
5285,Get the shot people.
5286,It is not worth the roll of the dice.
5287,Lol you’re getting downvoted just for stating your completely innocuous opinion.
5288,Reddit is very reddit today.
5289,It is also sad because so many vaccine appointments are going unused.
5290,What studies where those?
5291,Can you provide a source please?
5292,Ugh.
5293,FB has deteriorated into a shit show of hatred and blatant misinformation.
5294,I dropped it two months ago.
5295,I’m so much happier now.

5350,"I’ve gone to some other stores since getting vaccinated but they were all more fun (high end fashion stores, Apple store, bakeries), had fewer people in them, and offered a customer service experience that was enjoyable."
5351,The grocery store just wasn’t enjoyable and didn’t feel worthwhile.
5352,I’m also not used to the huge variety of items (delivery had been more limited) and I realized I prefer not having to make so many small decisions about things like grocery item brands.
5353,"I’m going to stick to grocery delivery, I think."

&gt; Most healthy adults may be able to infect others beginning 1 day **before** symptoms develop and up to 5 to 7 days **after** becoming sick."
5357,It is also known the flu has aerosolized spread like Covid (see e.g.
5358,[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3372341/](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3372341/) ) - but maybe to a lesser extent.
5359,"However, I have skimped to this paper and it seems that aerosolized spread might even the predominant method of spread for the flu!"
5360,"I would actually assume the methods of spread are similar, it's just that you need less viruses for infection/there is more partial immunity for the flu or something similar."

5374,"If so, we can create booster vaccines."

5400,*
5401,This is exactly the thought process that pushed me from hesitant to eager (back in november).
5402,"I think this reaction is very natural and common and ita important than we don't shame people for having this reaction, but instead address this fear just like you have done here."
5403,The headline is misleading.
5404,Why delete my comment stating that?
5405,Shouldn't speak with food in your mouth
5406,"If they aren't high risk and you still maintain some precautions like staying outside, then you should be alright."
5407,Right... Based off of one comment from a user you know everything about their gym and generalize a whole country.
5408,The US does not consist of only Florida.
5409,So weird to hear how different everyone’s experiences with the vaccines after having covid.
5410,"I was sick March 2020, and both shots left me with barely a sore arm."
5411,It also seems to have helped the super high heart rate during exercising (I could easily get to 200 bpm with little effort) and super low heart rate at rest (down to 39 bpm randomly) that Covid left me with.
5412,Now my heart rate doesn’t hit above 180 on my runs and my heart rate bottoms out around 47 bpm.
5413,"I think they might have meant his predecessor, who did, to put it diplomatically, make some serious errors in handling the early response."
5414,this is good and bad news.
5415,"Bruh, I teach pharmacology."
5416,"I am very, very well aware of the clinical trials process."
5417,"You might look up the definition of ""emergency use authorization."""
5418,Is it ideal?
5419,No.
5420,"Is an actually remarkably well-researched vaccine that's been in development for a decade and has passed safety and efficacy trials better than just shrugging ""meh"" and accepting loads of preventable death and disability?"
5421,I can't believe people are still arguing that the answer to that question is no.
5422,"While this is all true, I (admittedly selfishly) am mainly calling this more of a *personal* finish line."
5423,"I've been strictly adherent to guidelines this past year+, and knowing that I'll have some more leniency to actually go out in public &amp; visit other vaccinated friends in person is so great."
5424,"Also, AFAIK the trials are still keeping up with the participants (and there are also probably more trials that are ongoing) to determine just how long immunity seems to last."
5425,"From what I've read/heard, boosters are most likely going to be a necessity going forward."
5426,"But this is completely fine to me--it's likely  that by the time my immunity starts to wane, they'll have a better picture of how to handle that sort of thing."
5427,I was nervous too!
5428,"It's been a rough year and change for everybody, but as I've been fully vaccinated for a month or so, I've started going to theaters again, seeing family and friends that have been vaccinated, eating indoors, even planning a small vacation, etc!"
5429,"I look at it as this: over the past year from intense lockdown to getting fully vaccinated, I've done everything I could to mitigate the risk of catching and spreading to those who are high risk within my household."
5430,"And now, even though I will still take many precautions, I feel slightly okay doing more and more things!"
5431,"We've made it this far, we'll get through this part as well!"
5432,It sounds miserable.
5433,I mean I wasn’t looking to get sick but it was nice to get out of the house at least
5434,"As of this week, All state colleges and universities in MA are requiring vaccine to return in the fall"

5436,More like they're seeing that Rogan and Musk have no expertise to comment on medicine or epidemiology and are talking out their asses and you might be on to something.
5437,And if that occurred during a clinical trial it would've been halted immediately
5438,My vaccination site was a health clinic.
5439,Twenty people that were early 20s to mid 40s showed up because we were on a waitlist.
5440,Twenty eligible people didn’t show that day.
5441,This was March.
5442,My second dose was in April when it was open to everyone.
5443,All young people again.
5444,Friends said mass vax sites were telling them it may be an hour line and they showed up and got the shot immediately.
5445,I 100% agree with what you are saying.
5446,It seems the younger people and the very old have been the most willing.
5447,No
5448," 

You can't use breakthrough numbers because of time delays."
5449,"For example, lets say that I am fully vaccinated, but I'm a person who won't be protected by the vaccine."
5450,lets say that I eventually catch COVID 3 months from now.
5451,"Well, for the next 3 months you would be counting me as someone who is protected by the vaccine when in reality I'm not but it just doesn't make it into the breakthrough numbers for 3 months."
5452,The breakthrough numbers would eventually trend towards the trial numbers given enough time.
5453,And that's fine - 95% is REALLY good.
5454,"I’m 35, in good health with an amazing immune system..."
5455,I don’t care if I spread it to others...
5456,"So yeah, I need an incentive..."
5457,More like the India virus has arrived and the “bulletproof” feeling young people have is vanishing.

5460,[removed]
5461,"Not to mention the ethical aspect, you are literally giving it to people without telling them about a possible fatal risk."
5462,That's highly unethical and also one of the main reasons why it was stopped.
5463,"Moreover this ""paper"" fails to mention that doses of AZ were very low anyway and supply has been a far bigger issue than the 2 weeks stop."
5464,I guess we could also write a paper about how the low supply of AZ has killed hundres of people.
5465,Congratulations for not realizing comments like this are the actual problem here...
5466,Wasn’t Michigan one of those states that voted to tie the hands of its governor and just let the disease run wild?
5467,Death is not the only thing I'm afraid of regarding covid.
5468,Long/lingering Covid is something that I'm not too keen on experiencing.
5469,"A former coworker of mine--a healthy, fit mid 30's male--contracted Covid in December."
5470,"Last I spoke with him (around March), he still had issues with fatigue, and said he would have highs and lows in terms of energy levels day-by-day."
5471,I am not sure why some people focus so hard on the death rate.
5472,"Viral infections can still be rather serious even excluding lethality, and even if they weren't serious for younger people, I'd rather not unknowingly catch the disease &amp; spread it to immune-compromised people (who typically are not able to even be vaccinated in the first place)."
5473,Not dumb at all.
5474,Have fun
5475,"Unfortunately I don’t have a source for this, so hopefully someone more astute from me can find it, but a friend of mine who has a PhD in immunology posted on Facebook a while back that the longest time *ever* between a vaccine dose and the appearance of a novel adverse event was only 6 weeks."
5476,And that was with an immuno-comprised individual who received a live attenuated smallpox virus.
5477,"He wrote that when serious adverse events occur after vaccine administration, they occur within a few weeks."
5478,"So it isn’t something like 20 years from now, all these people are going to start having problems."
5479,"It’s a completely reasonable concern for someone to have, but hundreds of millions of people have been receiving these vaccines for months now, so they’re well-vetted and they’re safe."
5480,Applied :)
5481,Why do they have to make the headline sound negative?
5482,"It should be ""Michigan now hospitalizing **fewer** people over 80 than people under 40""."
5483,People don't read articles and these news agency ought to stop it with these misleading titles.
5484,Your dad should see a different doctor.

5495,"15 year olds aren’t eligible for the vaccine right now, so that’s the first sign that the report is bogus."
5496,"Yes, but I don't think we're agreeing on the overall point of the post here."
5497,"Not a single fan at any of the events I went to last summer had a vaccine, and yet anecdotally I never had any problems and I can't find any of the events being linked to anybody else having problems either."
5498,Convincing me and others like me that I need a COVID vaccine to safely attend the same sporting events that I safely went to last summer unvaccinated isn't going to work.
5499,Just get vaccinated you dumb fucks
5500,We don't know the long term effects of this new viral infection either.
5501,Looking pretty grim.
5502,"""Mild"" infections are still really bad, ask Ted Nugget."
5503,"People lose their sense of smell for a long time, and that's ""mild""."
5504,Nobody has lost their sense of smell from the vaccine.
5505,"An uncontrolled infection is much more destructive than a vaccine could ever possibly be, as no vaccine makes more of itself in your body like the virus does."
5506,"If this new vaccine technology could change your DNA, we'd be curing diseases like sickle cell anemia, metabolic disorders, and baldness with it."
5507,Pharma companies would make so much more money off that than vaccines.
5508,"""I think antivaxxers should be removed from the country."
5509,Seriously.
5510,Gone.
5511,"You promote dangerous antisocial ideas like this that actually kill people, you gone."
5512,"We can make room for reasonable people, but not antivaxxers."""
5513,"(if they can make disingenuous arguments about vaccines, so can we, and yes we are still better people than them) 

These are now some of the most tested and safe vaccines in history."
5514,"The ""pause"" proves how safe and cautious the CDC is being about the vaccines."
5515,"**And this is the ""Triple mutant"" variant from India**"
5516,"When I got my first dose of Pfizer, I had a cold sore (from a cinnamon allergy) and the RN who gave me the shot was like, “raise your hand if you feel unwell.” 

I said, “unwell, like how?” 
“Oh, if your lips are tingling or you feel, I dunno... different.” 

So I sat there for the 15 minutes, actually sat there for an extra 10 minutes wondering if my lips felt more tingly than than have been for the last 3 days."
5517,I respect you for that ❤️ I hope it's successful
5518,Nobody knows.
5519,[removed]
5520,"Because the actual wave is bigger, but most of it is “invisible” due to those that are vaccinated, if you know what I mean."
5521,"So I’m absolute numbers you could have gotten this amount of young people hospitalized, it’s just that the wave would have been too big due to older people - leading to restrictions much sooner"
5522,I agree that the vaccine is what is protecting the elderly here.
5523,"However, if you read the article, you’ll notice that there actually *is* an absolute increase in case counts for young people and that this increase is largely attributable to the B117 variant

So this is great news if you’re vaccinated and looking for assurance that the vaccines really do have an effect, but pretty terrible news for you if you’re a kid in Michigan who isn’t able to get vaccinated but is at much higher risk for the virus now"
5524,Just a reminder to everyone that often anxiety is irrational.
5525,It's very difficult if not impossible for many people to rationalize their way out of anxiety.
5526,Telling people that X event only has Y chance of occurring often doesn't help anxious people feel more comfortable.
5527,"If you're talking to an anxious person about vaccines, dismissing their anxiety and condescendingly telling them about how driving their car is more dangerous is not helpful."
5528,I'm well aware of the almost non-existent risk of serious side effects for COVID vaccines.
5529,"As soon as I'm able, I will get my shots."
5530,But that doesn't change that in the few days after the shots I'll be extremely anxious and terrified of serious side effects.
5531,"I know that it's not rational, but anxiety isn't a rational thing."
5532,For many people it's just a part of being human.
5533,What will help me are the coping strategies I've developed over time that let's me deal with my anxiety.
5534,"It won't make things 100%, but it will get me through the worst of it and at the end, I'll be well protected against COVID."
5535,"If you have friends and family who are anxious about medical stuff like this, please don't look down on them for something that's not their fault."
5536,"Don't cite statistics and say ""why are you even worried""."
5537,"Try your best to empathize, encourage them to get vaccinated and offer support for dealing with their anxiety."
5538,At what point will the US distribute vaccines to other countries?
5539,Or already dead from covid.
5540,Good to hear!
5541,"Actually some people with long Covid have clearly improved condition after getting vaccinated:

5551,can evaluate vaccine safety and efficacy because there are some shared skills across science disciplines?
5552,2.
5553,So anyone with a bachelor's in engineering can accurately interpret the raw data from a study in an entirely separate field?
5554,3.
5555,"Nobody said a lack of data is sufficient basis; not everyone agrees there is a lack of data, but also you are the one defining ""long enough"" in this case."

5557,"Please explain why ""twice the length of time the vaccines have existed"" is important."
5558,"It's not as easy as it sounds due to many exceptions, and once you reach a certain critical mass of exceptions (at which regularly scheduled flights are able to take place) it becomes pointless anyway."

5573,"Vaccine ""passports"" will be arriving."
5574,Or ya know.... maybe it's cause the vaccine is working.
5575,Professional wrestlers are super fit but drop like flies after 50. Who knew taking all those bumps to the head deteriorate your immune system
5576,Applied.
5577,Thanks.
5578,So that’s a bit of it: the elderly are protected now.
5579,"However, the increase in cases and deaths for young people is caused by the B117 variant getting super out of control in Michigan."
5580,"That is honestly a pretty scary deal if you’re a Michigander who isn’t vaccinated (like your average high schooler), but is now a lot more at risk of getting the virus."
5581,It is good news for vaccinated folks though - it really shows that the vaccines are working!
5582,The physiological stress of mounting an immune response can knock you off cycle.
5583,Happens to me if I get sick.
5584,It’ll re-regulate.
5585,All evidence and expert consensus points to the fact that Covid is going to become endemic.
5586,So trying to wipe it out is a bad use of resources.
5587,"What are we going to do next, vaccinate and social distance animals, so we can eliminate animal reservoirs threat?"

5590,That’s awesome!
5591,We need more of this
5592,"I think it can be a bit of both, though, even without fear mongering."
5593,"The Economist last month came out with [a data tool](https://www.economist.com/graphic-detail/covid-pandemic-mortality-risk-estimator) showing folks' risks of hospitalization and deaths from COVID, and young people's hospitalization odds were higher than what I would have thought."
5594,"A 28 year old man with no risk factors (my characteristics), for example, still has a 2.6% chance of being hospitalized."
5595,"Obviously, still low odds altogether, but a good deal higher that what I would have guessed given the fact that somebody with that profile is still almost certain to survive COVID."
5596,"So I'm fully supportive of the press highlighting hospitalizations amongst the young, as long as it's not totally doomsday-ey about it (this article is paywalled, so I can't see how it approaches it)"
5597,[removed]
5598,because our president is an imbecile and waited for the last second to buy the vaccines
5599,"Anybody who's suspicious about the covid vaccines now is an idiot, millions and millions of people have been vaccinated all over the world now, there are several safe, effective vaccines, and choosing not to get vaccinated just puts you at more risk when there's absolutely no need for it and might result in you spreading covid to someone who might not make it if they get sick."
5600,"The event with 30,000 people that I went to had no restrictions whatsoever beyond the encouragement of wearing a mask."
5601,The half a dozen semi professional baseball games that I attended had three seats blocked off in every direction between groups of fans.
5602,"Nobody had their feet on the back of my chair, which as far as I'm concerned was actually better and I wish it would stay that way."
5603,I assume you don't sweat or something... because I sweat a ton and feel like I'm getting water boarded after 10 minutes.
5604,A woman's reproductive system is part of her immune system.
5605,It's plausible that periods may be a little wonky after the vax.
5606,There are immune cells in the endometrium that help the uterus accept an embryo rather than reject it.
5607,"It doesn't make women infertile, that's a lie some have told, but the endometrium is what is shed during menstruation."
5608,"Clearly we don't fully understand the connection, but it's plausible that there is one."
5609,"it's very difficult to do that, or donaul trump wouldn't be so obsessed with building a wall, for example."
5610,"Not ALL bodies, the ones in my circle who have had covid are fine now, thank you"
5611,Probably because the US blocked export until its own people had access.
5612,"Now that there is plenty, they can export."
5613,"I bet you'd also be doing fine if you didn't wear a seatbelt... until you get into a car crash and you ask yourself why you didn't wear it (if you still have the opportunity)

It's moronic to say ""we're doing fine"" when there's evidence that it's not what you should be doing"
5614,"I didn’t have fever, but I was a little achy, very tired, and the one I wasn’t expecting, hungry."
5615,"I spent the whole next day napping, eating, and watching TV."
5616,It was kind of a nice excuse to be a slug for a day.
5617,Seems like this has happened in most countries around the world.
5618,"1) Scientists urge for caution and measures to contain virus

2) Governments and general public dismiss scientists' concerns, and in some cases try to silence them

3) Sick people overwhelm hospitals and die in large numbers

4) Governments and general public: shockedpikachuface.gif"

5620,Reporting reality that happens to scare selfish man children into behaving in a way that benefits society is exactly what they should be doing.
5621,Sorry about your feelings.
5622,It was kinda an all-day event for me.
5623,Closest location I could find for an appointment was about an hour away (depending on SoCal traffic) and then I had to wait over an hour both times after checking in before I finally received my shot.
5624,This was at a Rite-Aid.
5625,"So yeah, in all probably about 7 hours of my life was dedicated to receiving both jabs haha."
5626,Was this a common thing to go the entire time without going into a store?
5627,"Germany’s second wave wasn’t too bad, in the circumstances."
5628,"Their average cases per capita peaked at about 1/3 of Britain’s with 1.1.7 - partly due to vaccination, and their deaths were much lower."
5629,"It was obviously much worse and I suspect more could have been done, but “disaster” is harsh when, on a global scale, Germany has continued to do well."
5630,They can’t do that though.
5631,India also has its own highly effective vaccine that it’s mass producing

5637,I hope we continue it forever.
5638,"They do in the cities, and Pfizer can be stored in a normal fridge for 30 days."
5639,I think one of the driving factors in my work center not showing interest in the vaccine was that about 1/3rd of them got COVID at some point and came out of it pretty easily.
5640,"I got the vaccine, but I also wasn't concerned about getting COVID regardless."
5641,Link to such an article or study?
5642,"I haven't heard that, in fact I have heard that there is no real reason to not be vaccinated at time of infection other than the need to not risk infecting others, and that one should be in Isolation from everyone and everything at that time aside from medical appointments."

5644,The pandemic isn’t over based on policy - it’s over based on data.
5645,The fact the you keep using hoarding shows how little you know about the topic.
5646,I'm 18 hours into my second Pfizer dose and have hardly felt a thing.
5647,And 18 hours is typically the window for some bad side effects
5648,"Honestly, while it was a big lifestyle shift to not go to stores for a year, in many ways this has been the best year of my life."
5649,"It’s weird to say that because of everything that has happened in the world, but I went from being at work all the time to having 3 meals a day almost every day with my kids, and getting to play with them every day."
5650,"We’ve had movie nights, built tons of lego sets, explored nature preserves and just generally had life slow down in a way that has been pretty amazing."
5651,I’m rethinking a lot of “normal” life as a result because it feels like putting time with family ahead of everything else really should be what is normal.
5652,Can you quantify the risk of me spreading covid to others while I regularly test negative to covid via PCR nasal swabs?
5653,What journal published evidence can you find proving your assertion that individuals with no detectable viral and or nasal amounts can even transmit covid to others to begin with.

5661,"First off, two doses is definitely better than one, though even one provides a good chunk of protection."
5662,"That said, I think we also should recognize that having 92% of people come back to get their second dose is a damned miracle."
5663,"It's hard enough to get 92% of any given population to do anything, let alone something that might come with nasty side effects."
5664,"While it's important to reiterate that the second dose is important, we should celebrate the current successes of our vaccination campaign"

5668,"To me, he'll always be the guy that watches people eat worms and stuff."
5669,They are vulnerable now because of no vax but not before?
5670,About 0.7% of their population.
5671,"Pretty good ramp, I believe they were at 5 million/day a couple weeks ago."
5672,Hopefully they can keep increasing at this rate.
5673,"There's no need to ""believe"" one way or another."
5674,This pandemic ***is*** happening and it doesn't matter what anyone believes or doesn't believe.
5675,India has its own highly effective vaccine that it should have mass-produced faster.
5676,India has also been donating vaccine doses all over the world
5677,Wasn’t it estimated that new variants typically take 11-14 days to settle in a given population?
5678,If that’s accurate AND the numbers in India are much higher than reported.. wont be Long before 2 strains merge to form something deadlier than the strain from Manaus
5679,It's only a good thing if those people got offered a vaccine and turned it down.
5680,Most countries haven't been able to offer the vaccination to younger age groups yet so it feels a little like you're getting thrown in front of a train to save an elderly person when news like this comes out.
5681,Seriously what’s with the YouTube comments section on coronavirus news videos?
5682,Its like Twitter but way worse.
5683,I just assumed they are all bots or foreign actors (Russian?)
5684,posting to stir things up.
5685,YouTube needs to do a better job weeding out troll accounts and bots.
5686,I see you're still only concerned about yourself.
5687,You won't acknowledge the risk that you're putting other people in.
5688,You literally ignored everything I've said about how not getting vaccinated puts those around you at risk.
5689,"There's nothing that I or anyone else can do to change selfishness like that, and there's no point in arguing with somebody who completely ignores the entire point of the conversation and argues in bad faith."

5735,Honestly it's different for the States I think because you have so many vaccines and thus can choose between them.
5736,I'll be taking whichever one I can get once we finally have enough that the government allows my age group to get it.
5737,"""But you and I also know full well that there are lots of things that you can do to prevent that from happening."""
5738,Indeed.
5739,I have worn a variety of masks since day one of the pandemic.
5740,Evidently they have worked well enough to prevent me from getting COVID while standing in 20sq foot enclosed rooms with covid patients for 70 hours a week.

5767,Thanks
5768,The over 80 group were being hospitalized more until recently.
5769,The vaccine seems to be working and the mutations of covid are putting more under 40 people in hospitals compared to what we have seen in the past.
5770,You’re not fully protected until two weeks after your second dose.
5771,The second dose boosts your immune response to higher levels than just one shot.
5772,People make different amounts of antibodies and it’s also influenced by age.
5773,Some people may have 80% efficacy with one shot.
5774,"Some may have lower than 50%, but getting that second shot helps everyone get the highest efficacy possible."
5775,Herd immunity is easier to reach with high efficacy vaccines.
5776,"If the vaccines have 95% efficacy, you won’t need as many people vaccinated to reach herd immunity as you would with lower efficacy."
5777,What a disastrous take.
5778,They should have mass produced their own highly effective vaccine faster
5779,[removed]
5780,Ah thanks for the explanation ☺️
5781,This is great news made even greater when you keep in mind that there are about 20x more people under 40 than over 80 (don’t quote me on this stat is just a rough calculation but the logic holds) so it’s so much more positive but it’s also sloppy reporting and the data has been massaged to be sensational
5782,He doesn’t lock down because it’s election season
5783,"But the more we downplay the reality of those kinds of cases the more we get people opting out of the vaccine which increases those kind of cases happen, *and* increases the likelihood of the virus mutating into something even worse."
5784,"There isn't an ""unnecessary fear"" here."
5785,"Covid only wants to infect, propagate, and evolve."
5786,If we keep up this laissez faire approach it may very well get to the point where we are legitimately unable to have a normal society because we have a supervirus with an extremely high mortality rate.

5812,I’m not saying that’s negated I’m saying the article title serves two purposes intentionally because it can be interpreted in two ways...the nefariousness comes from the fact that it draws in those who don’t know as much about the situation by first inducing fear.

5816,"Yes, *obviously* that's how it currently works; was that supposed to be some kind of 'gotcha'?"
5817,The way it's currently run doesn't mean that's how it *should* be.
5818,And it's not even about being charitable; it's in the best personal interest of Western countries to tackle this pandemic in a globally coordinated manner.
5819,Hoarding supplies to create severe disparities so early on is far from a collective coordinated effort.
5820,"Fauci himself has criticized this, and copying below some other sources I listed elsewhere:

&gt;In late January, 16% of the world's population had access to 60% of the vaccine supply at the time."
5821,"[Source](https://globalhealth.duke.edu/news/ensuring-everyone-world-gets-covid-vaccine)

5822,"[Source](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/12/15/us/coronavirus-vaccine-doses-reserved.html)

5826,Sure.
5827,"Nothing will change until a clear line in the sand is drawn to where you can not wear a mask, go to bars, travel on an airplane with no mask, etc."
5828,Cold hard truth is you arent going to sell people on getting an emergency use authorized vaccine if it doesn't directly benefit them.
5829,People on Reddit need to also understand that COVID restrictions aren't really a thing outside of liberal metropolitan areas in America.
5830,You can do whatever you want in Nashville and New Orleans maskless.
5831,The government has been wildly out of touch since the beginning.
5832,People in Miami were laughing when Pres Biden came on and said you can be outside without a mask on if you're vaccinated as if it was some major milestone.
5833,Things they've been doing forever.
5834,What incentive do those people have to get a vaccine?
5835,"""That it helps others""."
5836,Just not going to cut it sadly.
5837,To combat it the CDC has to start communicating very clear incentives like lifting mask mandates.
5838,"Ex: You can grocery shop without a mask when 50% of the population is vaxxed, go to the gym without a mask when 75% of the population is vaxxed, etc."
5839,And publish the metrics.
5840,And this is coming from someone who is fully vaccinated

5856,"I’ve had walking pneumonia and stomach flu...even food poisoning...all
Worse than any short term vaccine side effects."
5857,I’m not using “urban” as code word for black.
5858,I’m using it for city dwelling millennials and gen-Zers.
5859,And even if I were that history doesn’t excuse them from the responsibility of getting vaccinated.
5860,Just because something is understandable (and it definitely is in this case) we just don’t throw up our hands and go “oh well”.
5861,Everyone needs to get a shot.
5862,Everyone has an equal responsibility to do it.
5863,Countries can only do one of two things right: prevent deaths or give vaccinations.
5864,America failed in the former but succeeded in the latter.
5865,Canada the opposite.
5866,"We just had a huge spike in cases, deaths, and a hospitalizations, so it's coming down from the spike right now."
5867,It's still quite high.

5869,"That's bollocks, the entirety of the EU will be pretty much fully vaccinated by the end of the summer,

That much is obvious from publicly available delivery schedules to the EU."
5870,"Yes, and the point was that Israel now has very few restrictions."
5871,I.e.
5872,Israel is *already* open.
5873,Any comparison between states plans right now and Israel are a moot point since Israel has already executed that plan.
5874,Im not lost.
5875,I suggest you take a break and reread what was said
5876,[deleted]
5877,"I agree, but it's also true that deaths occur pretty steadily and a sizeable \*sustained\* disruption could cause issues in a system not accustomed to sudden change."
5878,Do you think we'll transition from covid tests  to antibody tests?
5879,Would be useful to see if my body is actually responding to the vaccine (and check if my antibody level has dropped off in 3/6/x months)?
5880,"If my body isn't accepting, get a different vaccine shot."
5881,"If my level dropped off, time for booster shot 

Countries will likely be more willing to accept (high) antibody test than negative covid test ?"
5882,I think some antibody tests can differentiate between antibody from past infection versus antibody from vaccine?

5893,"While I agree with you, over time."
5894,"In the short term, we cannot have a more contagious,  more deadly variant that is resistant to the vaccine."
5895,We will be back to square one.
5896,Do we know how lockdowns + masks effect the excess death regarding other causes of death?
5897,For example during lockdown + mask Mandate you will see a lot less flue deaths than usual… maybe less deaths due to accidents as well?
5898,Thus the real number of covid deaths is probably even higher… but this is just a guess on my end… do we actually know?
5899,They're wrong.
5900,Unless the way you look at it is comparing them to Oregon.
5901,"At this point, low hesitancy and past infection rates are both working in California's favor."
5902,People take tidbits of information and try to make them “logical” in their own minds.
5903,"They *want* this all to be over, so they will interpret every story as supporting the idea that we are in the homestretch."
5904,"If younger people are getting hospitalized, it must be because younger people aren’t vaccinated, because that fits with the narrative that we are winning and we can go back to normal."
5905,Reality is way more complicated.
5906,"And, ironically, it’s that denier attitude that will also contribute to high rates of infection and hospitalization among younger people."
5907,"Oh, no doubt, but it seemed like public health messaging at the beginning was that the vaccine might not be that effective against transmission at all (e.g., that it would help prevent symptomatic Covid but not Covid altogether)."
5908,Was there valid reasoning behind this speculation or was it always a remote possibility?
5909,There are *way* more people under 40 than there are over 80.
5910,It’s not even close.
5911,[removed]
5912,Not to mention if you get some kind of other illness or fall down a well they might not have the resources to help you.
5913,How many 80+ year olds are there compared to 40- year olds?
5914,Seems like a skewed statistic.
5915,"&gt;spreading fear to get views

Or you know, spreading facts to get people educated."
5916,This is them reporting objective data about how COVID is a health threat even for young people and a reminder of how they should get vaccinated (as they mention in the article that vaccination rates are a major cause for those numbers).
5917,If you felt scared after reading that headline then perhaps you should consider getting vaccinated so you can lower your chances of being a statistic.
5918,Same for others who fit that demographic.
5919,"It might be a ""fearful"" headline to you and others but it's a truthful one and one that should hopefully educate younger people about how they should get vaccinated even if they think their age means COVID isn't a health threat."
5920,"https://www.ox.ac.uk/news/2021-02-24-overall-deaths-did-not-increase-most-chinese-regions-during-initial-covid-19

&gt;	A new study involving researchers from the University of Oxford and the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention (China CDC) has examined the change in overall and cause-specific death rates during the three months of the COVID-19 outbreak in early 2020."
5921,The results are published today in The BMJ.
5922,"&gt;In China, the emergence of COVID-19 was first reported during mid-December 2019 in Wuhan city, Hubei province."
5923,"Coinciding with the January 2020 festivities for the Chinese Lunar New Year, the virus spread rapidly across China."
5924,"This led to a national lockdown on 23 January 2020, which continued until early April."
5925,"&gt;The study analysed data from official Chinese death registries for the period 1 January – 31 March 2020, and compared this with the same period over the previous five years."
5926,"The researchers performed separate analyses for Wuhan city, the epicentre of the pandemic, and elsewhere in China."
5927,"&gt;The main findings were:

&gt;The overall death rate in Wuhan city was 56% higher than would be normally expected (1147 v 735 per 100,000)."
5928,"This was mainly due to an eightfold increase in deaths from pneumonia, most of which were COVID-19 related."
5929,"Deaths from certain other diseases also increased modestly in Wuhan city, including cardiovascular disease (29% increase: 408 v 316 per 100,000) and diabetes (83% increase: 46 v 25 per 100,000)."
5930,"Overall, in Wuhan city, there were about 6000 additional deaths (4573 caused by pneumonia) in January-March 2020 compared with the expected rate based on the previous five years."
5931,"Excess deaths were significantly greater in central districts (compared with suburban districts), in adults over 70 years old, and were higher in men than women."
5932,"Outside of Wuhan city, the overall death rate did not increase, and was in fact slightly lower than that expected (675 v 715 per 100,000)."
5933,"This was due to fewer deaths from non-COVID-19 related pneumonia (47% reduction), chronic respiratory diseases (18% reduction), and road traffic incidents (23% reduction), all of which coincided closely with the lockdown."
5934,"It appears that China is not an exception to the common knowledge among epidemiologists that swift reaction, strict lock downs, contact tracing, and PPE usage are effective at preventing deaths from SARS-CoV-2."
5935,Yeah I know but These are all anecdotal and vary by person.
5936,My wife had a headache and swollen arm.
5937,"Still, “i couldn’t get out of bed for a few days” is better than covid and ventilators."
5938,A lot of comments here saying vaccines work.
5939,Of course they do.
5940,I don't see many people arguing that.
5941,"What they argue, is need."
5942,Most of the people I know not getting it are saying they don't need it.
5943,Lol Are you lost?
5944,"This is what you were responding to:

&gt;People always say this but then conveniently forget that both countries still had, and have, plenty of restrictions in place."
5945,"The UK in particular had a very strict lockdown over the winter, which definitely helped to bring down cases."
5946,They didn't just open up everything in the way that some US states are doing.
5947,"&gt;Of course, the vaccines are helping a lot."
5948,It's just that this 40% is not some sort of magic number above which you can just reopen everything with zero restrictions.
5949,"Given the vaccine had passed the trials any serious issue would've been picked up then, any serious issues that did occur that weren't picked up in the trials must occur at a very low rate."
5950,Particularly for the older age groups the risk benefit was always going to be in favour.
5951,Therefore suspending the use of the vaccine is controversial and would lead to avoidable deaths.
5952,"Many countries with similarly well respected scientists didn't suspend the use of the AZ vaccine in older age groups whilst the serious effect was investigated, the UK being a prime example."
5953,Precisely because the benefits outweighed the risks by such a huge margin for the eldest age groups.
5954,I'm not saying which approach is better but it's not a 'dumb take' as you put it.
5955,Plenty of experts at the time said that the benefits for the oldest age groups always outweighed the risks and that the suspension should not have gone ahead.
5956,"It's a public health and ethical dilemma which has good arguments for either side, both certainly being 'pro-science'."
5957,So you’re saying the most vulnerable are not vaccinated?
5958,Most people aren’t really affected by Covid so thats why the vulnerable are of the utmost concern.
5959,[removed]
5960,Half the population under 25 and only 6% over 65.
5961,It's no wonder this was able to creep along undetected for a while.

5976,He usually says these stupid comments when he has guests that are scared to contradict him.
5977,He tried that when he had Bill Burr and it did not go too well.

I'm sorry your friends are idiots."

5999,"I work in Indiana, we are getting patients from Michigan right now."
6000,The Covid mutation B1.1.7 is seeping into our state.
6001,It is a mutation of the original just like the other 1000 variants.
6002,The vaccine is very effective against the mutation.
6003,95% for both Pfizer and Moderna at the second dose.
6004,"However, the age demographic is 30-50yr olds."

6008,Thank you!
6009,!
6010,Gotta give it more time.
6011,"Michigan just opened up their vaccines to the 16+ crowd 4 weeks ago

People getting the Pfizer vaccine have just started getting their final shot last week."
6012,+2 more weeks to be considered fully vaccinated.
6013,"I’ll agree Michigan has made it super easy to get the shot started, but it’s not like people can drop what they’re doing to get vaccinated."
6014,Plus there’s probably a good number of people who’d rather go somewhere official than drive up to Costco for the bulk savings shot.
6015,It’s an option for those who don’t see the issue which is great but I’m willing to bet this is primarily a time a thing.
6016,"Also can’t discount those who want to hear more stories of side effects from direct sources than from the internet

I’m not getting upset at the numbers until end of May tbh."
6017,So I’m going to suggest everyone wait and see how it pans out.
6018,Absolutely guaranteed that shot administration numbers are going to be a Bell curve and we’re still in the beginning
6019,I’m 27.
6020,My friends and I are all fully vaxxed.
6021,"Please calm down, boomer."
6022,It's natural selection.
6023,There'll always be mutations.
6024,The ones you see making the news are the ones which survived and were able to spread better because their mutation provided them some advantage over the rest.
6025,Deaths lag new cases by about a month if you compare the two latest peaks.
6026,Cases are also plateauing a bit.
6027,"To everyone saying it's just because older people are vaccinated:

&gt;Compared to the height of the fall surge in early December, Michigan’s average daily hospitalization admissions for COVID-19 are up 33% for those age 18 to 29, 58% for thirty-somethings and 64% for those in their 40s."
6028,"Whether it's the variants or changes in behavior or something else, covid is currently affecting younger people in worse ways than even during the bad surge."
6029,Fox News has proven that people on mass will consume opinion based media as fact.
6030,"There are two possibilities, either Joe Rogan does know people on mass will believe him, or he doesn't."
6031,"If he does know people will believe him, then he is culpable and should stop as he is knowingly doing harm."
6032,"If he doesn't know people will believe him and he thinks people are aware the things he's saying aren't true, then what's his goal of saying those things?"
6033,"He speaks in the context of educating and informing people, which just doesn't make any sense to do if you don't believe that's what you are doing."
6034,"So, at what point does governor Brown realize there’s no point in attempting to protect the unvaccinated?"
6035,Same is true in Florida.
6036,The children’s right to health.

6043,"His illegal behaviours are not her problem, nor the problem of the children."

6061,The conversation was not about reopening plans in certain states vs. Israel

Modi and the doctor are claiming even though the 2nd wave is intense, recovery rate is faster and mortality rate is lower."

6085,No they arent
6086,I had read moderna could keep for longer?
6087,[could be totally wrong]
6088,The second dose also boosts the spike antibodies in your blood tenfold!
6089,"So, no wonder."
6090,"Uh no, donate 100,000 and then Nepal paid bought 2 million more of which only around 50% has been delivered, since India halted export for now"
6091,"Not sure if this will be buried, but...there's a new strain in India (they're calling it a double mutant) and it's far more intense than the previous waves."
6092,"It's affecting more than half the population and its killed a fair share of the younger cohorts

I know this is strictly anecdotal but yeah, there's been cases in India of the strain effecting young people pretty severely too."
6093,Lagging indicator.
6094,&gt;You’re not fully protected until two weeks after your second dose.
6095,"Right, which is something like 95%."
6096,"So the guidance from CDC is basically: ""If you get the Pfizer/Moderna, you must isolate for 6 weeks until you reach 95%, for the good of everyone!"
6097,"But if you take J&amp;J, you're fine after 2 weeks at 50% protection."
6098,"Nothing confusing here!"""
6099,"Basically, the standard of responsibility is higher for people who get the Pfizer/Moderna shot, which is ridiculous."
6100,"The flu kills approximately 30k per year, which averages to 100 per day."
6101,"A ratio of 7 is less than 10, which means they're the same order of magnitude."
6102,That part's just math.
6103,"Also, calling it a lull is disingenuous, since every indication is that it will continue to decrease."
6104,"Stop fear mongering, the vaccines are working"
6105,This happened to me on my first shot.
6106,Fortunately (?)
6107,I have a history of panic attacks so I knew what was happening and was able to use my calming techniques.
6108,I wouldn’t wish anxiety or panic attacks on anyone because it’s very hard to use the rational part of your brain to calm down.
6109,Especially if the attack isn’t caused by a normal trigger or in any way feels different from what you’ve experienced in the past.
6110,For the second shot I asked my partner to drive me to and from the appointment which helped a lot.
6111,"But the Republicans told us it was only going to kill the old and the infirm, who don't matter!"
6112,"This may be a dumb question, but why are deaths in the U.S staying so stubbornly high?"
6113,They’ve practically hit a wall at &gt;700 seven day average.
6114,I just don’t understand with the vast majority of at-risk folks vaccinated.
6115,How have deaths not reached an all time low yet?
6116,Who’s dying when nearly all 65+ are vaccinated?
6117,I’m feeling so frustrated with this.
6118,"I think it’s because I don’t understand, and deaths seem to play a big role in the return to normal."
6119,It does not prove your point especially since you didn’t make any distinction between vaccinated or not in your first comment.
6120,"If you were only referring to vaccinated people, you should realize there is a vast difference between Israel’s green pass system and states opening up with zero restrictions on both vaccinated and unvaccinated people."
6121,"One of these groups can still catch and spread covid like wildfire, and it’s not the vaccinated ones."
6122,Yeah I mean we’ve all had regular Illnesses that are worse than these short term side effects.
6123,Why are people so terrified now?
6124,These colleges/universities will have a ton of work to do address vaccine hesitancy.
6125,A few of my professors and classmates stated  that they were not comfortable taking the vaccine and they are hoping that their classes stay on Zoom next semester.
6126,"For the most part, my program is doable on Zoom."
6127,"However, for fields like science or medical fields, a Zoom class will not suffice."
6128,The only exemptions my college announced was medical exemptions and religious exemptions.
6129,One of my friends is doing an engineering program and it requires in person instruction but his school  also requires vaccination.
6130,She isn't happy about it because she is not comfortable getting the vaccine because she still feels it's too new and the fact that she has not gotten sick with COVID at all.
6131,The only thing I could tell her is that getting protection via COVID is a gamble at this point.
6132,The controversy in Hungary is they're opening up after giving people only 1 dose of the vaccine.
6133,"As of February, less than 500 people under 40 in the U.S. had died that weren't obese and less than 200 people under 40 had died that didn't have a co-morbidity such as heart disease, lung disease, obesity, etc...Also, the average age of death is still 82.4 years of age in the U.S."
6134,The seat belt analogy is lacking depth.
6135,Not getting the vaccine for a 30 year old is like not wearing a seat belt while changing parking spaces at the grocery store.
6136,Not getting the vaccine for a 80 year is like not wearing a seat belt at a demolition derby
6137,Can I just say that attitudes like this are the primary reason I hate going to the weights part of the gym.
6138,"Something about the masculinity getting swole, making fun of others for not lifting, bro, kinda douchy attitude is just such a put off."
6139,I want to get more muscles but I'm just afraid of ending up acting like one of the douchebags in the gym.
6140,"I have always been a biker and long distance runner, just hate the gym people."
6141,the shade of brown person should not be a bias for medical advice... shade of brown man is liar and very very stupid.

6157,I had absolutely no reaction from both of my Pfizer doses.
6158,I need hospitalization after trying to read that title
6159,Article is discussing how the spike binds to ACE2 receptors in the endothelial lining of the circulatory system.
6160,Brazil wants it classified as a thrombolic viral fever (first known) for similar reason.
6161,Attacking the circulatory system would also partially account for why being old is such a risk factor and 20-somethings either need massive viral loads or a total lack of care to *die* from it.
6162,"It's what is being reported, unless you have better sources with higher numbers."
6163,What are those numbers???

6168,"The India/California hybrid variant was identified in California a few weeks ago (I think), so in the absence of specific data it will be interesting to see what happens in the US."
6169,"Of course, the California variant was the dominant variant there for a relatively long time before the hybrid showed up, so it may be that California's population will fare better against it than other parts of the country would/will."

6177,Is it safe to drink?
6178,Sputnik V was made with similar tech to the AstraZeneca dn J&amp;J vaccines.
6179,"Without testing Sputnik vs the common variants in Brazil, the fact that AZ was effective against the SoithAfrican variant while J&amp;J was much less successful isn't really much support to assume it would work in Brazil."

6186,But that same logic applies to the new virus which can also mutate as it goes along.

6188,Me too!
6189,Had a big work party for the first time since Christmas of 19.
6190,"Masks were ""required"" but I barely saw any, which was surprising."
6191,I forget that reddit has way more hypochondriacs than normal.
6192,"Ok, when is the shenanigans going to stop?"
6193,More than 24 hours since receiving my 2nd dose of Pfizer...and I've got nothing.
6194,Little bit of a sore arm and thats it.
6195,First dose knocked me on my ass the day after.
6196,I thought such a reaction from the first would guarantee a harsher one on my second.

6198,"You're not missing anything, that guy just likes being a keyboard warrior"
6199,Oh my goodness this is a wonderful resource and much easier to find the information I’m looking for!
6200,Thank you so much!
6201,&gt;Are young people having higher hospitalization rates as a percentage of total hospitalizations?
6202,Are there higher amounts of hospitalizations when look just at the age group?
6203,total hospitalisations in the younger cohort could still be misleading if they were previously being triaged behind older patients and told to stay home and are now being admitted as a precaution because there are more open beds.
6204,i have no idea if that’s actually what’s happening but it doesn’t seem unrealistic.
6205,Birth control has an insanely higher likelihood of causing blood clots but it's still approved and tons of women take it.
6206,Quite a low CFR.
6207,Any particular reasons why?
6208,Does anybody know if I would ever be able to find out if I had Covid after I took the vaccine?
6209,I recently got my first dose of the Pfizer vaccine but was pretty sick earlier in the outbreak.
6210,"I got tested negative, but it was well after I had recovered."
6211,I'd like to know if I was ever sick.
6212,Number 2 is Thursday for me.
6213,Looking forward to it.
6214,"Very epic, and surprising that DC was this early to begin to restore basic human freedoms to the people."
6215,I had a similar cathartic moment a couple nights ago.
6216,Watched the NFL draft with friends I havent hung out with in nearly 2 years (moved out of state) and it was such a mood booster.
6217,"Im not a very social person, but after having been denied it for so long it feels so good to feel normal again."
6218,"I'm pretty convinced most people aren't actually having adverse reactions to vaccines, even the second one, but that just like Amazon or Yelp, the bad ones are more likely to leave a review."
6219,Like there's this Internet wisdom that the second one will knock you out.
6220,"But a couple weeks ago, I was at a gathering with vaccinated friends, and I asked every single person who got the vaccine one by one, and a small fraction of them actually had a reaction to either dose beyond a sore arm and being more tired than usual."
6221,Are you a bot?
6222,Heard some loud mouth Disc Jockey on the radio harping on about old people and people with bad immune system getting whacked by Covid 19 but then goes on to say that healthy people have nothing to worry about.
6223,Absolutely false.
6224,This Covid 19 is a really strange virus.
6225,"It is so random that a super healthy person can catch it and die and a person that is in terrible condition catches it, have mild symptoms and fully recovers from it."
6226,That is why I am always playing it safe.
6227,I don't care if I got both Pfizer shots.
6228,I'm still not going to run around pretending I'm immune and invincible.
6229,I'm going to continue to wear my mask and social distance.

6244,I didn't have to close my eyes and lay down at all.

Cute!"
6246,You believe that.
6247,"When the petition was going around, I was hoping it wouldn't pass.. appears most voters are idiots."
6248,smh
6249,Considering the average age of death is 78 I’m sure the ratio of people under 40 compared to over 80 is what like 95/5?
6250,Cool story
6251,I think 44% of my state is fully vaccinated and vaccine hesitancy rather than supply is our biggest limiting factor now
6252,I think the  dominoes are going to start falling very fast on restrictions and mask mandates
6253,Seeing this in the hospital I work at.
6254,We had our COVID unit down to only six patients and seemingly overnight we had to open a second unit and came dangerously close to our hospital being at capacity.
6255,A lot more young people this time around
6256,"In my county 50% of young people have their first shot, so doing great."
6257,But in the state as a whole it is barely 25%.
6258,"The thing unvaccinated people don’t seem to realize is that pretty soon the vaccinated are going back to normal life, and that leaves the unvaccinated wide open to get Covid."
6259,"Since anyone who wants the vaccine can get it now, in my state there is wide availability, it’s either step up for the vaccine or get the antibodies the hard way.."
6260,"*Looks down at belly*

Well, shit."
6261,bingo.
6262,Every day they wait to get vaccinated is a riskier choice than him (half vaxxed) playing soccer outside.
6263,Aren't there a significantly higher number of 40 year olds then 80 year olds?
6264,Not that just doing vaccines is any better.
6265,"I'd get it personally, and as an EU citizen I'd support it being approved provided it's produced here or quality control is proven."
6266,"It annoys me the EU took so long to look at it because it's an ""evil country vaccine"", I don't care for Putin or Xi but if their countries are putting out working vaccines we should be paying attention to them."
6267,"Besides I kind of want it to be approved in the EU so that vaccine uptake in Russia will grow, vaccine skepticism is worryingly high there and the PR boost would help a lot."
6268,"My ""vaccine ranking"" in terms of which vaccine I'd like to take if I could choose among all of them would look something like Pfizer = Moderna ≥ CureVac &gt; Sputnik &gt; Novavax &gt; J&amp;J ≥ AZ &gt; CanSino &gt; Bharat Biotech &gt; Sinopharm ≥ Sinovac."
6269,Not that this list is particularly objective or my opinion on their efficacies (by nature incomensurable as these ratings are based off of different studies) matters much.
6270,Maybe its that fire Flakka ?
6271,🤷🏽
6272,I dont need you to respond.
6273,I don't think you understand what word salad is.

6275,I clearly didn't discredit the vaccine.
6276,"What ""other safety measures?"""
6277,California was the worst in the nation Nov-March.
6278,"Are you claiming some new ""other safety measures"" started there in April?"
6279,The reason California has a very low rate now is because they have a massively high rate for 4-5 months.
6280,"Vaccine helps, but places with similar vaccine levels that didn't get wiped out this winter like CA aren't doing anywhere close to as low of cases now."
6281,States where stupidity runs rampant get stupid results.
6282,My sister is an air care EMT on a pediatrics unit.
6283,"So she flies around in a helicopter, basically picking up the sickest of sick kids who need emergency care for whatever is ailing them."
6284,She picked up what most people would consider a shocking number of children over the past year who were severely ill from covid.
6285,"You know, since it supposedly “dOeSnT aFfEcT kIdS.”

Now all those parents get to be saddled with insane medical debt because their extremely sick kid *did* need a hospital stay."
6286,And who knows what other long-term symptoms those kids are still experiencing.
6287,My niece is about 10 and got covid about 3 months ago.
6288,"She had bad symptoms: high fever for a week, frequent nose bleeds, flu-like symptoms, brain fog."
6289,"She’s mostly recovered, but still experiences brain fog."
6290,"She forgets the words for colors sometimes, mainly."
6291,"Which is concerning, because she’s always been extremely bright for her age and colors are something learned at about 4 years old."
6292,I bring up whenever I can how many emergency hospital-admitted covid-positive children my sister has worked with over the course of the pandemic.
6293,People need to hear about actual experiences instead of letting Joe Rogan tell them if they were born in the 80’s or later they’ll be *fiiiiine*.
6294,Meanwhile in Florida last Friday Machine Hun Kellys concert in Jacksonville was at capacity/sold out and praised by Florida news as the first major event ….. and HARDLY ANY MASKS AT ALLL……..
6295,Yeah obviously?
6296,Youre acting like thats a bad thing.
6297,Has your friend had the opportunity to be vaccinated yet?
6298,There have been reports that receiving the covid vaccine helps with long covid.
6299,https://www.yalemedicine.org/news/vaccines-long-covid
6300,"Maybe just anecdotal and not based in science, yada yada, but I am from Brazil and people in here can clearly see how many more young people are dying from this."
6301,"Maybe it has just spread more, but I know too many friends and friends of friends in their 20s who have died recently from covid in Brazil, and some only a day or 2 after getting it."
6302,It only seems logical that the virus has become more lethal.
6303,CCP is efficient.
6304,"As a legal matter, it's fairly easy to document the benefits of masks and vaccines."
6305,"On the other hand, mask/vaccine resistance appears based on opinion."
6306,"Judges are bound by evidence, not superstition."
6307,Why doesn't it make sense?
6308,We can think that the benefit of allowing people to eat in restaurants outweighs the cost of the additional risk of infections while still wanting to reduce smaller risks which have little or no benefits.
6309,Viruses have no issue being both extremely infectious and extremely deadly.
6310,Smallpox had an r0 of 3.5-6 and killed 30%.
6311,"The first Saturday on which shopping was possible again without an appointment, caused crowds in many cities."
6312,In Eindhoven it became so busy that the municipality called on people to stop coming to the city center.
6313,Hilversum also asked people to come and shop at a different time.
6314,"In Amsterdam, one-way traffic was once again established in the Kalverstraat and Nieuwendijk for the first time in months."
6315,It was also very busy on Plein 40-45 in the Nieuw-West district.
6316,"Amsterdam called on people to stop coming to these busy places, but in most places it was manageable or ""pleasantly busy"" according to the municipality."
6317,"In Groningen, the municipality established one-way traffic in Herestraat due to the large influx of people."
6318,"Rotterdam, The Hague and Utrecht reported that the crowds were manageable."
6319,"German May 1 visitors
Enschede had to deal with many German visitors, said city center manager Duco Hoek at RTV Oost ."
6320,"The terraces
 were full and the market was very busy."
6321,"According to Hoek this was to be expected; it was the first weekend day that people could shop without an appointment again, the terraces were open again and it remained mostly dry."
6322,"In addition, virtually all shops in Germany, including supermarkets, were closed due to Labor Day."
6323,"Not everyone in Enschede is happy with the massive arrival of the Germans

'Well, an absurd number of Germans."
6324,"Absurd'
Earlier this week, the municipality of Enschede called on Germans to stay away, but many people did not respond to this."
6325,Yet there was no intervention.
6326,"Crush barriers were installed in a number of places, so that shoppers could wait somewhat corona-proof until they could enter the store."
6327,Many Germans were also on the move in Venlo.
6328,Traffic controllers were set up to spread the flow of visitors over the various parking garages.
6329,The crowds did not lead to major problems there.
6330,In Roermond there were long queues at the designer outlet.
6331,Waiting times at some stores increased to a few hours.

6381,I can only speak to my personal experience.
6382,I work in a small hospital in Michigan.
6383,In November/December 2020 we had a spike in cases.
6384,Our patients that were very sick or died seemed to be an average age of 75.
6385,In the last 2 weeks or so our average age of very sick patients has been around 45 yo.

6392,My friend has been on meds since they got covid last December.
6393,Vaccination is a safer way to get antibodies.
6394,It's kind of like the virus has mutated enough to look for red hatted morons now.

6405,It is regional.

6407,"B.1.617 is definitely driving a majority of the outbreaks, but if another variant is super spread then that variant would be the fuel for the outbreak in that area."

6410,Why?
6411,yea you can get whiplashed from reading the stupid takes on this sub lol.
6412,"""the cdc has had shitty messaging about vaccines"" and then 10 seconds later ""nahhh its not vaccines bro, its natural immunity"""

6418,"I can wait, the variants that now dominate our province didn't just magically appear it's assholes that brought it in through the airports."
6419,How does that align with the low efficacy to J&amp;J towards the P1 variant though?
6420,"If all known vaccines did just as well against a variant I could see assuming others would too, at least until we have hard data for the others."
6421,But with J&amp;J losing a lot of its efficacy towards a certain variant it seems we can't assume if some work they all should.

6456,*
6457,I'm not taking a shot.
6458,I live in MI and had covid last February.
6459,Just have a bang energy
6460,"The Deep South has some longstanding cultural traits that make it extraordinarily vaccine resistant: a distrust of outsiders and ""experts,"" a resistance to doing what you're told to do, and a willingness to suffer collectively terrible health outcomes rather than be bossed around by outsiders."
6461,I'm frankly not the least bit surprised at these figures.
6462,[removed]
6463,Probably because everyone has been pushing the narrative that young people don’t have to worry as much.
6464,Not just Joe Rogan.
6465,That’s why schools reopened
6466,They are toddlers throwing a tantrum because mom told them they need to eat their vegetables.
6467,Experience in California was a month ago after a frustrating painful wait suddenly everyone I know was getting vaccinated.
6468,Manufacturers keep ramping up production.
6469,Next shoe to drop is in 8-10 weeks demand in the US is going to drop off as we reach 80% vaccinated.
6470,Which will free up a couple million doses a day.
6471,"Same thing here, in Brazil."
6472,"From the article: ""Statewide, roughly 46% of Californians have received at least one dose."""
6473,"From Google: ""In **Colorado**, 2,658,086 people or 46% of the population **have** received at least one dose."""
6474,Colorado cases are among the worst in the country right now.
6475,"Therefore, I am correct ;-)"
6476,If this is a correct hypothesis (that new variants are now more lethal to younger people) then that means it has more like the spanish flu from 100 years ago.
6477,Basically the more active/aggressive your immune system the worse it affects you (I may be simplifying it poorly).
6478,Aayega to modi hi 🖕
6479,But what is in it for us?
6480,Who is gonna pay for it?!?
6481,/s
6482,"&gt; Cases have already peaked there

Source?"
6483,"The 7-day rolling average has declined for like two days, so it's premature to say that's a peak."
6484,It's still 31% higher than two weeks ago.
6485,https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2021/us/oregon-covid-cases.html
6486,They are all low is my point.
6487,"This is done of a phone survey, it's massively inaccurate."
6488,"Not to mention most places just opened first shots to everyone a couple weeks ago, so it wouldn't even have an impact yet whether people are hesitant or not."
6489,"In a month or 2, yes."
6490,The point is that this cousin who feels 'pressured' is going 'omg the Doctor said this!!1!'
6491,"as some sort of brilliant argument, when the truth is it's not."
6492,It's just the cousin latching on to something that supports likely pre-existing beliefs.
6493,"Edit: Also, to be honest I find it hard to believe that the doctor was commenting on such things, unless it was with the misguided intention to try and soothe the cousin."
6494,"EMA didn't suspend, EMA said the benefits of the vaccine outweigh the risks and to keep using it whilst they investigated."
6495,It was some individual regulators for some countries that did.
6496,"Numerically, it's awful."
6497,Truly tragic.
6498,"But compared to where we were over the winter or where we were a year ago today, it has gotten a lot better."
6499,"We have a ways to go, for sure, but we seem to be on the right trajectory."
6500,Because the older people are already fully vaccinated?
6501,From your BMR?
6502,Lol okay everyone just eat 300 calories to lose weight
6503,Pretty much every restaurant is already open so I don’t see that happening.
6504,I guess I implied waiting by saying the booster shot would be delayed.
6505,But I didn’t explicitly say what you and others said: don’t go anywhere public with a covid positive diagnosis except a doctor or hospital if needed.
6506,I wouldn’t say it’s silly because it’s not 0.
6507,Immune systems can sometimes cause an overreaction which is usually what kills you g people.
6508,That’s often why young people die from the flu.
6509,This is why seemingly healthy people can die.
6510,What part of 'we don't have the power to travel back in time' do you not understand?
6511,Lol.
6512,It's like you expect Canada to pull vaccine factories out of thin air or something.
6513,It's completely irrational to compare a country on something it can't fix to another.
6514,"I'm not sure whether you're a pissy American or just a Canadian unhappy with the response, but it's irrational either way."
6515,Yep and most of the cases seemed to be in LA sadly.
6516,Why does that discredit the doctor seeing the people going to the ER?
6517,Just because people are fine doesn’t mean others are also fine.
6518,"&gt; but don’t want to hear the common story that the persons course was minor/felt like a rough flu

No I have zero issues with a lot of people having it be similar to the flu whatsoever."
6519,But this shit really does seem to be Russian roulette and my issue is I don’t want my family member handed the gun with a bullet in the chamber.
6520,If all the “it’s like a flu” stories did was reassure people that they don’t need to panic as they observed proper mask wearing and social distancing then I’d be tickled pink.
6521,But what they do is reinforce a narrative that you can just completely ignore it and opt out of the vaccine.
6522,And more and more people die because of those people.
6523,[removed]
6524,Fun fact something like 95% of Canadians live within a 4 hour drive of the border.
6525,Because more people over 80 are either dead or vaccinated.
6526,It’s not like it suddenly became more sever for the younger population...
6527,Are people you know now getting vaccines after seeing friends get sick?
6528,Or is there still no rush?
6529,"&gt; Luckily for them, it's not that lethal

The problem with this though is that we don't have any accurate or precise way to predict (individually) how mild or severe a case of Covid19 will be (again, individually)."
6530,"Mortality stats are just ""generalized"" statistics."
6531,.they don't map accurately down to individual outcomes.
6532,That's what makes SARS-Cov2 so insidious to deal with (is that it's so hard to predict individual reactions).
6533,You could be a healthy 20-something and 3 weeks later you could be dead.
6534,I was 46 last year.
6535,"March-April I spent 38 days in the Hospital (16 of those days in ICU on a Ventilator).. and while that was early in the pandemic, Doctors still don't know why it hit me so hard (I'm not in any high risk group and didn't have any pre-disposing medical history)."
6536,"I fought back from the very brink of death,."
6537,"took many months of Rehab and physical therapy.. and I'm (thankfully) pretty much back to 100% with no ""long covid"" symptoms."
6538,But I basically lost an entire year of my life.
6539,"because again, theres a difference between saying that the cdc is causing people to misunderstand the power of vaccines and saying that people think natural immunity matters more than vaccinations."
6540,this is a huge logical leap because theres no herd immunity against many of the diseases that people vaccinate for yet nobody is out here saying that herd immunity to hpv matters more than vaccinating against hpv.
6541,"just seems like people are stupid, really"

6543,[removed]
6544,Our government fucked up by not investing in this firm.
6545,The UK has dibs on this vaccine instead of us.
6546,If I can try to help: a grown-up would have said 'I believe the true number is much higher than that'.

6567,"Even if the ER doctor is seeing 'tons', the ER doctor is also only dealing with those people who end up going to the ER in the first place."
6568,He's not seeing the literal millions of people who are just fine.
6569,"The reason why one country doesn’t have those tools has to do with choices that country made, not with some uncontrollable force beyond Canada’s control."
6570,uhhh yea no idea what youre talking about.
6571,"california is near the top as far as adults with at least 1 dose goes, and california is miles ahead of many hesitant states."
6572,"61.5% of californians over 18 have had at least 1 dose, compared to 51% in florida and 40% in mississippi"
6573,It leads to (some) people to not understand the impact of the vaccines.
6574,I'm not saying that's the CDCs intent or that those people are being smart and logical.
6575,If people understood how good the vaccines were they would not say dumb shit like that.
6576,The CDC partially contributes to this by making such a point of emphasis on talking about appropriate behavior for vaccinated people.
6577,I just don't at all see why this is such a logical jump to you?
6578,"Like I said, many gyms have ""restaurant rules."""
6579,Also note that two of the people infected were in fact wearing masks.
6580,Masks aren't going to protect you from an hour of indoors close contact with a presymptomatic infected person while breathing heavily.
6581,Lower than what would be a super light flu season.
6582,This is incredible
6583,Completely different virus
6584,"Seven and one are literally the same order of magnitude, and two numbers which differ by less than a factor of 10 are the same order of magnitude."
6585,This is the stupidest argument ever
6586,They tried requiring proof of negative COVID test.
6587,It didn't work as people simply got a fake test result card.
6588,"If you require a vaccine card, people will simply fake those next."
6589,The only viable system assumes that others on the plane are potentially infectious and lying about it.
6590,"Not only Indian government, Experts in the country, as well as the citizens were dismissive of another wave, and attributed the initial reduction in cases to their immunity and diets."
6591,"Now they're blaming it on variants, even though the country hasn't done enough sequencing to confirm this."
6592,"Oh and the individual states are refusing to fully lock down, so yeah, plenty of wrong going on."
6593,Interesting to see how motivating Pfizer is for many people.
6594,"Aha, I see."
6595,The total rates are close.
6596,CA did better than FL and TX last summer but crapped out after the winter holidays.
6597,I'm open to the idea that Florida cheats its numbers because the press has to sue to get them but who knows.
6598,The good news it that we'll see soon enough how this story ends.
6599,I don't think restrictions will matter as much as vaccination rates from here on.
6600,In Portland Oregon about 10 to 15% of people got covid.
6601,NYC probably around 50%

6611,"Some people have lost everything due to Lockdowns - businesses, relationships, sanity (we actually need face-to-face interaction, contrary to the views of some on this site)."
6612,"We will look back on Lockdowns as the biggest public health catastrophe in history, if such a thing as justice still exists."
6613,Focused protection for those vulnerable to Covid was always an option - we just chose not to consider it.
6614,"On the other end of the spectrum, CA is the huge success story."
6615,What a turnaround.
6616,AZ or the J&amp;J?

6622,We just can’t verify it unfortunately because independent media is not reporting.
6623,"Ok, according to Our World in Data, we have more cases."
6624,"I can’t predict how many cases go unreported in India, I can only work with the data I can access."
6625,So you're saying it isnt 100% returning for 2nd dose?
6626,That sounds way more logical than a global pandemic that we need to get under control and hopefully that will be with vaccines
6627,yea youre making a total jump in logic lol and you didnt explain how it leads to people thinking that natural immunity matters more
6628,Keep in mind a majority of the right winged conservative type assume the virus is fake.
6629,So they didnt get vaccinated
6630,Using logic.
6631,"Well, yeah, that's kind of how counties work right?"
6632,It wouldn't make much sense to draw the lines between different restriction levels *within* counties...
6633,"Remember, late March/early April, the cases went up a bit then plateaued before falling quickly."
6634,Give it time.

6671,Yup.

6674,That won’t remain the case for long.
6675,Mutations add up.
6676,"The more it mutates, the more resistant it will be until not even boosters will be worthwhile."
6677,"And as of right now, it’s outpacing vaccine roll-out."
6678,We’ll develop new vaccines for the variants but it will take months of testing before they’re rolled out.
6679,"By then, the virus will have mutated enough to reduce their efficacy as well, and then they’ll be ineffective before long after that."
6680,"“Vaccines even work on SARS”

6682,Oregon has large populations of both weird leftist hippies and right-wingers.

6686,All I'm saying is that now we've hit 50% we're going to start climbing slower and slower.
6687,We shouldn't wait to reopen for the wait-and-see people and the anti-vax Karens.
6688,"If they pass up the chance to get vaccinated, that's their risk that they assume."

6700,"Yes, that's correct it must be fully licensed in order for them to mandate."
6701,There will be exceptions
6702,The misunderstanding that people seem to have is that COVID is on the far edge of the gradient where it would need to evolve to become less lethal to keep spreading.
6703,"Presymptomatic spread can occur for days in the infected and it generally takes a long, long time to kill people (in viral terms)."
6704,Moderate resistance does not mean escape or the ability to evade the body’s cell mediated responses
6705,Multiple people on this sub have been denying it.
6706,The person I responded to turned out to be a conspiracy nut if you look at their other responses.
6707,I’d be perfectly happy if we can get enough people vaccinated with incentives and hope there’s even more rewards for people when they get their shot.

6726,I’d bet the over
6727,"Id have to imagine it depends on where you go, the only places I go out to are places I need to run errands at and for groceries, I haven’t been “out” to restaurants or any of the popular places in a long time because of covid."
6728,"I’m sure if you go to popular places for activities, downtown, international drive, etc you’ll see a mix of the two far more often."
6729,Yeah I mean I am as pro-vax as anyone - I am between shots right now - but compared to my friends and coworkers in the same city I'm on the slower side to vaccinate because I only checked CVS a few times a day (instead of constantly) until I only had to drive a half hour away instead of &gt;1 hour away
6730,"Also, let's be honest, things could get bad in Mexico and then America would suffer."
6731,Helping Mexico also helps the US.
6732,"Don't worry about it too much, it's a very good decision to take it."
6733,"Yes you might feel sick for 1 day (I did), but you'll come out of it stronger."
6734,The data speeks for itself.
6735,1 sick day is definitely better than chronic loss of smell etc.
6736,Best of luck!
6737,"Some vaccines are better than others, but they are effective against variants as well."
6738,"Vaccines even work on SARS, so there's no indication that coronavirus can mutate quickly enough to evade them."
6739,"Worst case if a resistant variant does show up, a booster can be made in a matter of months, now that we have the vaccine figured out."
6740,You’d be surprised how much of the world is so behind in living conditions and education even today.
6741,"Heck I visited Italy 15 years ago and they didn’t even have refrigeration in the local grocery store, so things spoiled quickly."
6742,"And that’s Italy, a supposed 1st world country."
6743,Just imagine if everyone in India received two free N95 masks.
6744,This is the way.
6745,You're the only one lying here.
6746,It is a easily verifiable fact that the covid vaccine is free in the United States.
6747,"3 issues with that 

First: cases are a dependent variable."
6748,You’re asking people to make the connection that them getting vaccinated will reduce cases.
6749,"While that sounds obvious, it’s not obvious to them."
6750,"Second, covid is probably seasonal."
6751,"At a low vaccination level, it exponentially grows in all seasons without extraordinary measures."
6752,"And at a high vaccination level, it doesn’t grow in any season."
6753,"But at somewhere in between, it probably grows in Winter and shrinks in Summer just like flu."
6754,Tying to cases means we hit a vaccination rate that protects us for now but then we might get hit with another wave in Winter.
6755,"Third, the last thing you want to do is encourage people not to get tested for covid because it will hurt the chances of reopening."
6756,"TBH, I think you are being far more rational than an average person in a wait-and-see group....

As a depressing counter-example: I know a 60-year old vaccine-wait-and-seer who has a bunch of preexisting health conditions, needs to air-travel quite a bit and who did not have the virus"
6757,In my state - WV - it’s running rampant in the high schools where the majority are under 16.
6758,It’s awful.
6759,It's likely case where just stuck a date on there and will likely end up lifting it a bit sooner.
6760,"45% of people over 18 have yet to receive a first dose though, which is relevant since a lot of our population is young and therefore ineligible."
6761,"While 45% not prioritizing getting vaccinated isn’t great, it’s a lot less bleak than 60% of the country not prioritizing vaccinations."
6762,I’d imagine the kids % will roughly track the over 18 % once they are eligible to get vaccinated just because I can’t imagine parents getting it and then not caring if their kids do.
6763,Omg this would straight up be more fun tho let's fucking go

6773,"Yeah, like just when I thought flying couldn’t get any worse"
6774,People seem to be upset by the obvious.
6775,"Not from NC, but I always thought that the ""non maskers are the non vaxxers"" is false and inaccurate fear mongering."
6776,"Sure, there's an overlap, but is smaller than you think."
6777,People hate them for different reasons.
6778,"Anti vaxxers are afraid of vaccines ""killing them or messing them up"" but definitely aren't afraid of masks since they're just cloth - in fact many will wear them if they're afraid of dying."
6779,"Those who hate wearing masks, on the other hand, aren't really 'threatened' by them - just really hate the inconvenience to the point that it gets to them, which is understandable after all this time, and WANT this to be over."
6780,"The only thing they might feel threatened by is when they're exposed to crazies who entertain the idea of masks being 'permanent', and hearing that from time to time, even if it's bullshit, makes them want to resist that."
6781,"In which case, I can't really blame them."
6782,Or hearing in 2020 that it will go until 2022.
6783,"But anyway, none of that is really consistent with having an issue going to get a shot."
6784,"You don't have to 'wear' a vaccine everywhere or get it every morning or have it impact your everyday life, just a couple pricks and that's it."
6785,Most who are 'anti mask' for the above reasons would take it in a heartbeat knowing it's a way out.

6812,We have more data on the covid vaccine than we've had on any other vaccine before approval.
6813,"Yes, but it’s so arbitrary."
6814,The same restrictions aren’t being put on retail and churches.
6815,Also this isn’t taking into account human behavior.

6837,"&gt;Keeping a policy in place after it is no longer needed is absolutely a big deal, and as I said above leads to apathy."
6838,Why does it matter what I do if it doesn't change anything?
6839,Airlines are going to be the absolute _last_ place we will see mask mandates lifted.
6840,"Since you want to debate whether this is ""arbitrary"", I'll bite with an explanation of why it isn't:  passengers are in close quarters in an enclosed metal tube for hours on end, and soon there will likely be more international visitors from areas with higher COVID-19 spread mixed into those aircraft, too."
6841,"Research has repeatedly demonstrated that COVID can and does spread onboard aircraft, with many documented cases in places that actually are recording the data."
6842,"IIRC, this policy also applies to ground-based mass transit, where ventilation is significantly worse."
6843,"The reason this policy is being extended is because it is still needed, and because current conditions make it very clear it will be needed at least through the end of the summer."
6844,"We'll be rapidly lifting restrictions over the last few months, but this one will be one of the very last to go - and that's supported by evidence and science."
6845,"From a legal perspective, universities open themselves to significantly more liability by requiring the vaccine than not."
6846,The CDC has guidelines they release on how to handle covid in certain situations.
6847,Individual states then interpret these guidelines and release a set of guidelines universities should follow.
6848,"If the university is following these protocols, they will have zero liability for outbreaks."
6849,"On the other hand, if they require a vaccine to attend and someone has a negative reaction to the vaccine, they are much more likely to be held liable."
6850,Is this right?
6851,"Of course not, but there's a lot wrong with our current legal system."
6852,Because they don’t see or understand it’s a team effort.

6867,Its pretty doable.
6868,Are you also skeptical of centuries-long practices of requiring ships to quarantine offshore for a month to prevent the spread of infectious disease?
6869,Lockdowns are literally the same thing.
6870,"Curious, what mRNA have been approved for public use in the past?"
6871,"My husband and I had the opportunity to travel back home to the US from the EU for 10 days as a detour from work related travel, so we decided to get the J&amp;J vaccine."
6872,It wasn't our first choice- but due to the long hold on the AZ vaccine and our short time in the US we felt that was the best option for us and we can't to be at full efficacy so we can start enjoying the things we did before lockdown started!
6873,"Thank you, I appreciate that!"
6874,"I didn’t realize that about kids under 10, that definitely helps"
6875,I know a lot of people are hesitant because they've read lots of anecdotal reports of reactions to the second shot.

7075,There was no real reason other than that our administration doesn’t trust us to work unless they are breathing down our necks.
7076,"I have heard that the Belgian facility produces 100 million per month, more than Marburg."
7077,I don't know if it's bigger or just more optimized since it's been operating for longer.
7078,So with the Delapharm plant coming online the EUs monthly vaccine production will be as much as 230 million doses per month.
7079,In just BioNTech.
7080,I think this factory is producing ahead of schedule.
7081,With the USA now also exporting Pfizer vaccines to places that previously recieved it's supply from the EU I think another announcement of Early delivery of significant size may be coming...

7088,"&gt;Ideally, I'd like to see 2+ years of data."
7089,No one credible in the field of immunology agrees with this.
7090,If the vaccine will cause long term effects they will be noticeable within 2 months.
7091,A vaccine can not cause long term effects 2 years after taking it.
7092,"I've been called weird before, and for things a lot less mainstream than a mask."
7093,Shut up and go get your vaccination.

7095,Yeah tbh I was kind of crying.
7096,"My phobia is so bad, but I had a really nice conversation with my doctor."
7097,"I asked him about his day, how things are going, anything fun events that are happening in his life etc and it gave me this sense of personability where I was able to relax."
7098,He was a very kind man and patient enough to deal with me haha.
7099,"Also he was smiling talking about his life a bit, so I think it helped the atmosphere."
7100,"We should just start calling them the ""fuck around and find out"" people instead."
7101,Injecting bleach is as good a laymans description of any anti-biotic as any other I've heard.
7102,I would bet that the numbers are higher for both new cases and deaths.
7103,"When things get that chaotic, it becomes difficult to keep all the data in check."
7104,And what happens to the people who die at home?
7105,Are there enough resources to perform autopsies to confirm the cause of death?
7106,My guess is that this isn’t happening.

7108,Good job!
7109,I got my first shot today too and I’m also terrified of needles.

7126,Hasn't had the time.
7127,We're also very busy at work.
7128,Some people just aren't living and dying based on the restrictions and will get it more slowly over time.
7129,I keep reminding them to register and everything and they work on scheduling it then get distracted.
7130,"Yeah, I see how that could be confusing."
7131,"I want to add 2 weeks ago, we had a literal pizza party with at least 40 people in our kitchen while we were operating our dinner shift."

7136,That’s not quite correct.
7137,A link was established for one vaccine deployed abroad in just a couple of markets.
7138,The CDC was concerned with doing a deep dive into whether any of the other vaccines caused such effects.

7160,Well right but most laypeople certainly didn't think it was going to go on for so long that Disney would be closed for 13 months... Or at least I didn't.
7161,Vaccinated adults help keep kids safe too.
7162,We have been pretty cautious but do not have our kids wear masks when they're around their friends once we started to do more play dates again.
7163,I feel comfortable with it.
7164,I want them to have a sense of normalcy and I feel like it's a reasonable risk.
7165,"i’m vaccinated, but i don’t see the point in being required to prove that i’m vaccinated to get on a plane and wear a mask."
7166,there’s no benefit for me other than... wasting more of my time lol.
7167,Because then you run headlong into the vaccine passport resistance.
7168,"In my case, the vaccine card that I received during my vaccinations is trivially falsified."
7169,"Without a nationwide database of vaccine recipients, caution is probably the best course."
7170,"And yes, people will be assholes and forge documents because of their freedoms - in this case the freedom to endanger others."
7171,Good.

7174,But I deserve that sarcasm since I bit him once when I had to get my tetanus (it was really out of date).
7175,"It was an accident, but he also put my face in his chest."
7176,"I think in general, Canadians will have higher vaccine enthusiasm than Americans."
7177,We're dealing with a country where most provinces are about as vaccine enthusiastic as New England.
7178,But I don't trust Alberta.
7179,They probably think that Bill Gates injects 5G towers into people's arms or something.
7180,Albertans think that Wyoming is a state to aspire to be.
7181,I'm tired of people on reddit telling lies
7182,"Oh for sure, by the time they were actually implemented."
7183,But if we had been proactive instead of waiting for cases to rise to some threshold before locking down then it could have been stopped.
7184,But that would have taken a lot of support from the government which clearly was not something the US was interested in
7185,"Vaccine providers: You want the pandemic to end, right?"
7186,Vaccine doubters: Yes.

7189,Vaccine providers: I have the solution!
7190,Vaccine doubters: I don't know...
7191,Vaccine providers: It's free!

7204,Yeah at a certain point normal had to resume.
7205,Straight up.
7206,"I'm just read to cross the gd border guys, hurry up and get vaccinated already!"
7207,Nothing is 100% risk free.
7208,"But thanks to these highly effective vaccines, the possibility of you getting sick from covid is reduced to a minuscule probability."
7209,After a certain point it’s time to start living with it in the same way we live with all the other inherent but unlikely risks that we face every single day.
7210,Oh I didn’t know anything about that.
7211,That’s wild!
7212,the lockdowns weren't for eradicating the virus lmfao.
7213,Lockdowns were to prevent massive spread of an otherwise unknown disease.
7214,And thus preventing the collapse of our healthcare and hospital system.
7215,I can't believe this is a prevailing thought in america.
7216,"Most of the ""I just got my THE Phizzerr"" posts were goodbyes."
7217,We just didn't know it.
7218,Same
7219,Yeah I guess I just don’t see India vaccinating 10x the 300k+ daily cases.
7220,"They aren’t exactly a place known for having a government capable of orchestrating much of anything in a reasonable, accessible fashion"
7221,India is one of the largest manufacturers of vaccines you know.
7222,Back in March they stopped exporting them.
7223,What they need it more of the raw materials and they can ramp up the production in-country if I remember correctly.
7224,It is being forced if you can't do the things the vaccinated can do.
7225,"You go to college for 3 years and then all of the sudden they require this vaccine you are ""forced"" to get it to graduate."
7226,You could dropout of school or try to transfer credits but at the end of the day you have to get vaccinated to graduate.
7227,"Nobody is holding you down and forcing you, but it is being forced in other ways 



It's like saying you have to be vaccinated to renew you drivers license."
7228,"Well your whole life depends on the license to get to work,shop and see family."
7229,"But it's not ""forced"""
7230,"You do realize the mask is not to protect you, right?"
7231,It's to protect everyone else from whatever you're spreading.
7232,"I'm all for it becoming the social norm to wear a mask whenever you're sick, but wearing it day in and day out once things return to normal is not doing what you think it's doing."
7233,The trials are looking at that now and the answer is increasingly that the jab does stop transmission.
7234,"no one is denying that, and that's perfectly fine."
7235,but directly requiring it will meet lots of pushback.
7236,"Indirectly, like mentioned above, works best imo."
7237,"I mean, the Xavier Becerra can make it de facto mandatory right now if they wanted to."
7238,Just set up a punishment for refusal high enough.
7239,Got my second Pfizer shot and had very mild cold-like symptoms minus sore throat and coughing.
7240,"Mainly hot flashes/ low-grade fever, 2 very short-lived chills episodes, very minor headache and minorly exacerbated  body aches."
7241,I expected much worse but I think I really lucked out.
7242,Symptoms lasted 2.5 days.
7243,Day 3 and I feel completely back to normal.
7244,I actually can’t believe it’s even optional.
7245,In 2009 I was forced to take the swine flu vaccine up my nose.
7246,I was in a room full of about 300 new sailors and there was many personal watching to make sure we did it.
7247,I didn’t like the idea it wasn’t approved so I squirted it on my scarf.
7248,Not every person but I suspect the people that made too much were more likely to be vaccinated already

7284,So what about Florida where our big brain legislature just passed a law outlawing mask requirements in the state?

7353,"In the UK too for example they wiped 10,000 deaths (about 20%) from the first wave when the reporting period was changed from 3 months to 28 days"
7354,Wtf dude...hope Pfizer comes to india.

7362,"The same people refusing vaccines are the ones against passports, shocking, and they are the majority."
7363,Whatev.
7364,Maybe some state hospital but some random dude who runs an auto body repair shop can't pull that information.
7365,"BTW, government organizations can't legally require a vaccination for COVID-19 for its employees."
7366,"None of the vaccines have been officially approved yet, only for emergency use."
7367,I think you are talking out of your ass.
7368,"May be the wild virus would not impact young healthy adults but looking at how the Indian variant is hitting even young people, no one is safe."
7369,I know people who have no pre-existing health conditions are impacted horribly.
7370,Of course Indian health care system is broken and so they are dying.
7371,Here one might not die but why risk getting infected by more dangerous variant.
7372,Please get vaccinated.
7373,We need at least 80% of population vaccinated(hopefully 12+ gets EUA soon and rest by end of the year).
7374,Now I think 50% is more probable :-(
7375,So republicans believe trump was sent by god to break up a satanic cult of pedophiles but don’t believe in a vaccine proven to be incredibly safe and effective?

7385,Can confirm.

7390,Interesting.
7391,"I wonder if maybe the school files keep records of that bc I didn't need to show proof when I entered highschool, only when my second shot around 15/16 was a year late and the school was notified I needed to prove I got my second shot."
7392,My university application process was also very easy as the school system had a website and I just clicked the programs/school I wanted to apply for and submitted.
7393,"I submitted no paperwork of any kind, not even transcripts."

7641,"The 50M + 10M AZ doses currently in America are a different story, and as this article states, details for those are still being worked out."
7642,The 20M Covishield doses that this headline references are specifically talking about made-in-India vaccines.
7643,**There is no such thing as a vaccine called Covishield that is NOT made in India.

7651,Congratulations!
7652,That article says nothing about minorities.
7653,You're not understanding - I'm not even specifically suggesting that this should be lifted in the next four months.
7654,What I am saying is that extending this for four months while we are in what is obviously a very rapidly changing situation (with vaccinations) sends the message that nothing people do (get vaccinated) matters.
7655,"If they said ""hey, we're going to extend this for a month and then reevaluate"" then great - reevaluating means that something *could* change, even if it doesn't end up happening."
7656,"This is obviously one piece of a larger ecosystem of restrictions, so obviously this isn't the only thing, and if it were I wouldn't have as big an issue."
7657,"As it is, it's just another nail in the coffin of ""get vaccinated, but don't expect anything to change"", which I think is hurting us."

I suppose one of the things that lead me astray, is this concept of the ""attack rate""."
7680,"From the article:

&gt; But the numbers actually look like this: 100,000 people are vaccinated."
7681,"Before the vaccinations, they would have expected an “attack rate” of about 1% or 1,000 COVID-cases in that population."
7682,"After the vaccines, that 1% is reduced by 95% and now only .05% of the population is expected to get sick - or about 50 people."
7683,"My question is, how is the attack rate calculated?"
7684,Are the people studied masking and social distancing?
7685,"And if the rates are calculated with that in mind, how do the rates (of both vaccinated *and* unvaccinated) potentially vary if those people do not practice social distancing and mask wearing?"
7686,"Like, will the 95% vaccine efficacy stay pegged relative to the attack rate?"
7687,"Or will it stay the number it is no matter what, masks and distance be damned?"
7688,"Using your example as a reference, if abandoning all safety precautions doubled the unvaccinated to 40 people, and vaccinated people acted the same way- then would 2 vaccinated people get it?"
7689,Or would it still be only 1 vaccinated person?
7690,"I'm assuming the first, which is why I was thinking of it the way I was before."
7691,But thank you for the clarification.
7692,Not *quite* the same.
7693,"Although sinovac, J&amp;J, and Sputnik uses the same adenovirus tech, they use different adenoviruses and probably different preparation methods, which may be the cause of the varying efficacies and dosing regimes between the 3 vaccines."
7694,"You'd also have to consider where they were tested, and against which variants, as effectiveness can vary between variants as well"
7695,I just believe that things will forever keep developing.
7696,"We have never had a highly contagious, un-eradicatable virus that can still cause disability in mild cases before."
7697,"(We’ve also never had a SARS pandemic before, so maybe this is normal among coronaviruses that are this severe.)"
7698,Mid may was last I heard
7699,Once in a century pandemic.
7700,Hundreds of thousands of Americans dead.
7701,"We have everything we need to end the pain and suffering, but millions of people are scared of a little poke."
7702,This truly is the dumbest timeline.
7703,Well said.
7704,"It's absurd that people won't get vaccinated, but forcing people to get vaccinated against their will is just the picture of tyranny."
7705,"You just need to isolate them socially, I think."
7706,"Get the vaccine passports going, require proof of vaccination or negative covid tests for sporting events and such."
7707,The willfully unvaccinated are basically plague rats and need to be treated as such.
7708,"Yea, that's the case for a lot of folks."
7709,"Like if it's not scheduled for them then they won't seek it out, especially if they basically self quarantine for one reason or another."
7710,"Most of us have been in quarantine so long we've forgotten what mild illness and allergies feel like, fingers crossed for good news!"
7711,Thank you for being a trial participant.
7712,Sincerely.
7713,I am grateful for my vaccination.
7714,I have less faith in it though now that B.1.617 is here though.
7715,It doesn’t matter how many vaccines we can distribute if 30% of the population refuses to take them.
7716,They’ll be a reservoir for new variants.
7717,New variants can still cause mild illness in vaccine recipients.
7718,Mild cases can still result in permanent lung scarring at frighteningly high rates.
7719,"(Post COVID Fibrosis) Every time new vaccines are developed, the virus will have mutated some more to be slightly resistant to them as well."
7720,How is this cycle going to end?
7721,Yes I would agree
7722,Of course I did.
7723,"But all I can do is live my life, promote vaccinations (which I do with all I can."
7724,"I was one of the 30000 trial participants you can thank for your Moderna shots by the way) and as things develop, act accordingly"
7725,There's also a big difference between an introvert and a shut-in.
7726,Smoke?
7727,No.
7728,Radioactive cloud?
7729,Yes.

7758,That’s not an acceptable solution.
7759,You’re downplaying the threat of this.
7760,Did you even read the whole thing?
7761,I was bed bound and unable to sleep from the pain.
7762,Second dose was on a Wednesday and the pain was strong enough Friday and got worse Saturday and finally I was able to sleep Sunday but still in horrible pain.
7763,Pain grew Thursday.
7764,"Speaking from personal experience, the first shot and overall scheduling process are probably discouraging a lot of people from going out of their way to get the second shot."
7765,I had to go back to my first dose site twice and wait in line over an hour each time despite making an appointment because they kept overbooking slots.
7766,"My reaction to the first shot was also very severe, and hearing all the stories about people whose second shots were considerably worse is very unsettling."
7767,"The fact that I have to wait exactly one month to go back for my second shot is inconvenient, and I know I’m going to be busy at work that week so I’m going to be stressed about being out of commission while recovering from side effects."
7768,"These are all minor grievances, and I’m still planning on getting my second shot because I want to travel internationally again, but I imagine people who don’t have as strong of an incentive or aren’t close to their vaccine site like I am might just say fuck it and not bother."
7769,[deleted]
7770,"Good lord, it's not an all-day event."
7771,"Both times I went in, I gave them my information, sat down, gave informed consent, and got the jabs."
7772,Then I waited the 15 minutes each time in case anything happened.
7773,The total amount of time for both visits was like 40 to 50 minutes.
7774,"Get vaccinated, people!"
7775,They are dragging our suffering for other anti vaxxer hesitant people however.
7776,I fail to see what the issue is if people choose to not take the vaccine and then get sick.
7777,I don’t feel sympathy for suffering of people that choose to enable their own risk?
7778,Why has this mindset changed?
7779,"I’m not a psycho who doesn’t want them to have medical access, but the reality is hospitals aren’t overwhelmed anymore and every person over 16 can get the vaccine."
7780,Then you should probably just stay inside
7781,I’m so sorry for your losses.
7782,"I had the exact same Wednesday, Thursday Friday experience!"
7783,It takes three/four weeks to get fully vaccinated.
7784,"It hasn’t been a long time since everyone has been elegible to get vaccinated in most states; not to mention with so much travel and their schedules full, most players who want to get the shot didn’t get it immediately upon they were elegible."
7785,Yup.
7786,I predicted their daily cases would start dropping by end of April since they would've reached Israel's vaccination % that led to their tipping point with Pfizer.
7787,Lo and behold I was right.
7788,"Not only that, they didn't see the surge in deaths that Brazil saw."
7789,Ape stronger together 💎✋🦍

7793,They literally walk you down a hall in basic training and people just put injection after injection into both arms.
7794,"True, but here in Japan they're trying to justify having concerts by saying ""we're taking all the precautions!"

7810,Lol!
7811,Most of the world is.
7812,But we had offers and people in leadership positions rejected them.
7813,They still are.
7814,There’s a reason most restrictions are in the process of being withdrawn.
7815,Reducing efficacy results in some people who otherwise wouldn’t have gotten infected experiencing mild cases instead.
7816,"(In any other disease, I wouldn’t care about this."
7817,"But this is COVID, we’re talking about.)"
7818,Some % of those cases will be the unlucky ones who are then scarred for life.
7819,They otherwise would have been perfectly fine if the virus hadn’t become slightly more vaccine-resistant.
7820,"I just got my two shots of MODERNA and if I go from not being affected at all to being slightly sickened by the India variant, then I could be one of the mild cases that develop Post COVID Fibrosis."
7821,There’s always gonna be a reservoir of new variants.
7822,Flu doesn’t cause lung scarring ever in mild cases.
7823,Those diseases that do also tend to be less infectious and so we’re eradicated.
7824,"(Or there’s like, a thousand cases per year rather than millions.)"
7825,"This is the first virus that can cause a pandemic and still cripple even with mild cases, that we *can’t* eradicate."

7829,I’m still trying to wrap my head around why you think this specific mask mandate is the one that should be offered as an incentive.
7830,"It only affects people for a few hours at a time, during one of the closest-quarters interactions most people have."
7831,“Sending a message” is a terrible reason to make policy without supporting metrics.
7832,Isn’t the entire thing you’re trying to argue for that things should be indexed on actual risk?
7833,"In this case, the elevated level of risk in transportation is clear for the next few months."
7834,You should redirect your frustration toward forming incentives that vaccine hesitant people actually care about.
7835,"By and large, they are not the population that is getting onboard airplanes - travelers skew older, wealthier and better educated than the general population."
7836,Remember way way back when we were told all these restrictions were necessary to protect the most at-risk and prevent hospitals from being overwhelmed?
7837,Good times!
7838,"Unless you're a Live-In-Woods Hermit, you're going to eventually have contact with someone who is infectious."
7839,"You're basically giving the ""I'm healthy so why should i have health insurance"" argument."
7840,"After reading it more, you're right, that's my bad."
7841,"I thought it was AZ but just may 24 people 18+ can get vaccinated, but it doesn't say AZ."
7842,I think I probably just assumed I would end up getting AZ with how slow the rollout started for Canada.
7843,So...
7844,"It's an agency, of spies?"
7845,Right?
7846,[removed]
7847,We have millions of AZ doses just sitting in cold storage that will never be used in the US at this point.
7848,They are definitely a blip in the overall battle in India.
7849,But if you mother was part of that blip it’d be pretty important to you.
7850,"Yeah, all this clickbait pessimism is driving me crazy."
7851,"As a RN, I confirm your statement."
7852,"When someone is in what’s called droplet precautions due to their type of infection, any who enters their room must wear a gown, gloves and mask to enter."
7853,This is simply to stop the spread at the patient; not infect the caretakers who take care of everyone else beside the infected.
7854,"Masks protect the user in this scenario, and trust me, everything in nursing (healthcare in general) is guided by evidence-based practice."
7855,We don’t just do it for funsies.
7856,"No, that's not true."
7857,I'm Canadian and feel we should be honest.
7858,We're doing terribly.
7859,"Every possible mistake that could be made, we've made it."
7860,"In terms of vaccinations, we are the best at being the worst."
7861,We are an absolute disgrace.

7872,I am not arguing that they shouldn't require it.

7888,&gt; It is not common in Asia for them to wear masks everywhere always.

7894,4-5 weeks isn’t enough time.
7895,I think you give everyone a couple more weeks to get an appointment then you’re not fully vaccinated until 6 weeks after that.
7896,I think 8-10 weeks is when things should fully open up.
7897,BC is at age 50 by the end of next week.
7898,Where you getting your news?
7899,"For 3 solid weeks the USA averaged above 3 million shots per day... meaning the next 2 or so weeks, roughly that same amount will be getting their second shots each day."
7900,The number for fully vaccinated will continue to skyrocket pretty quick.
7901,Your friends are living in a cocoon then.
7902,Ask them to step out into the streets and smell the burning funeral pyres.
7903,Does that still mean 3 1/2 months between doses instead of recommended 3 weeks?
7904,I've seen people suggest that they extend the directives in increments (e.g.
7905,"every two months) until they are no longer necessary, but the problem with that type of messaging is that opponents would accuse them of ""shifting goalposts"" because they interpret them as implying ""we think it's most likely going to end in 2 months."""
7906,"It's like that folktale of the father, the son, and the horse."
7907,"No matter what choice you make, you'll always end up unable to please a few people."
7908,"That’s what I do now, yes."
7909,[removed]
7910,Most countries which were hit hard were hit hardest during their second or third waves.
7911,It really is interesting though.
7912,"I would have thought that the widespread improvements that have been made in testing and treatment, more research on how transmission occurs being published, and increasing population immunity would generally make the initial waves the worst."
7913,"It just goes to show how bad complacency, fatigue, and sometimes mutations can be I guess."
7914,When people ask “What would anyone gain from continued lockdowns and restrictions?
7915,"!”
Well there ya go."
7916,My county is at 60% with first doses and 42% with second doses so we are doing pretty good.
7917,It’s just really attacking the kids now unfortunately.
7918,I’d say 95% of the adults at my school are vaccinated at least which is good.
7919,Yupp.
7920,It’s been sickening how the same people who have been crying about “lockdowns” and masks the whole time have been ignoring all of it since day one with 0 consequence.
7921,Soo many people just went about their daily lives even with symptoms or after testing positive.
7922,If we had some teeth to enforcement of quarantines we’d have been long since back to relative normalcy like Australia or NZ.
7923,I knew that was going to be your argument and I guess they're going to have to get vaxxed.
7924,"Right now, it's a free for all."

7944,I want to be sympathetic and compassionate but I have only anger and disgust for them.
7945,I didnt get any fever or anything but damn I was so tired the day after the second shot.
7946,Felt great ever since though.
7947,There were many news stories about people driving out to rural areas to get vaccinated all over the country.
7948,It definitely happened in California.
7949,"I couldn't find any appointments within the Bay Area, but there were a few out in places like Stockton."
7950,There was definitely a shortage.
7951,If they'd had enough for everyone they wouldn't have had to limit by age groups and occupation for several months.
7952,"I did eventually find an appointment, but that happened just 3 weeks ago."
7953,"Yes, the Vanity Fair article is about what I thought."
7954,The last 2 paragraphs I quoted are instructive.
7955,"After reading that I don't know how anyone thinks the Biden administration is going to ask to be ""repaid""."
7956,"&gt;As to whether the Biden administration can overcome the Trump administration’s contractual restrictions against sharing globally, a senior White House official told *Vanity Fair,* “I am confident that we will overcome any obstacles, when we want to do something internationally.”  
&gt;  
&gt;President Biden himself has made it clear that he intends to take a leadership role in the worldwide fight against COVID-19."
7957,"On February 18, he pledged $4 billion to COVAX (short for COVID-19 Vaccine Global Access Facility), a collaborative international effort working to buy COVID-19 vaccines in bulk and distribute them to the world’s poorest countries."
7958,Biden’s pledge makes the United States COVAX’s biggest contributor.
7959,"The administration is “walking the walk,” said **Gian Gandhi,** UNICEF’s COVAX coordinator for supply division."
7960,"&gt;  
&gt;Meanwhile, a Quad Alliance among Australia, India, Japan, and the U.S. is looking to boost COVID vaccine manufacturing in India, partly to counter China’s push to distribute its own vaccine to the developing world."
7961,"&gt;  
&gt;And then there is the Defense Production Act deal with Merck and Johnson &amp; Johnson, which could lay the groundwork for an ambitious plan to make the U.S. a global supplier of COVID-19 vaccines."
7962,"&gt;  
&gt;On Sunday, March 28, the U.S. government took what appeared to be another small step toward that goal."
7963,"A cargo plane touched down in Mexico City bearing 1.5 million doses of the AstraZeneca vaccine that is being manufactured here, but still has not been approved by U.S. drug regulators."
7964,"Ten days earlier, the Biden administration had announced plans to “loan” 4 million AstraZeneca doses to Mexico and Canada, and this was the first installment."
7965,"&gt;  
&gt;**Before the doses could be shipped, the two countries had to negotiate separate contracts to indemnify AstraZeneca."
7966,"Even then, the use of the term “loan” was designed to end-run the language in the original Operation Warp Speed contracts."
7967,"**  
&gt;  
&gt;**Last Wednesday, when one attendee at the White House meeting referred to the AstraZeneca “donation,” several people immediately piped up, saying, “Don’t use that word.” Said the senior official with knowledge of what transpired, “If they use ‘donate,’ ‘sell,’ or ‘share,’ it would be a breach of contract.” The issue has made “a whole bunch of \[government\] lawyers very nervous,” said the official."
7968,"“We, the United States government, have never broken contracts of that nature."
7969,This is not like DOD canceling an order for a plane.”**
7970,I don’t know why people are freaking out about this I get it but it’s not like colleges require you get a slew of other vaccines to enroll
7971,This isn't due to the blood clot issue.
7972,It's due to this shipment being partially manufactured in the plant that messed up the manufacturing.
7973,This is good and quite normal.
7974,We need vaccines to attend highschool already.

7981,"It's much deeper than just red or blue, this is part of the whole fabric which has challenged this area (and many others) as our world has changed over the last several decades."
7982,"They are being left behind, and we don't know how to help them catch up."
7983,Not just this (vaccine) but in healthcare and education and technology and things that make your life better.
7984,I get sad when I go to visit.
7985,"Canada is intentionally not giving second doses after 3-4 weeks, so the 2% statistic is meaningless."
7986,"We have over 30% of the population with one dose, some provinces are closer to 35%."
7987,"Things are actually going pretty damn well up here, contrary to what some people would have you believe."
7988,Who cares?
7989,The program helped save lives.
7990,"Imho...   we should *(if vaccines are 'jammed')*

We could literally.... offer it **without any appointment** *(ay a \~17 age limit)*

* *so everyone (who wants it) will be vaccinated*"
7991,"Every state has a database for immunization records, which also get mirrored up to the cdc."
7992,"Also, wherever you get the vaccine, which is recorded on the card as well, keeps their own records."
7993,This stuff is easily verifiable.
7994,"I don't understand why so many people on reddit are convinced that when you're immunized, the medical record of it just vanishes into the ethos with no way to verify it."

8000,"I’ve been meaning to ask this question -

Is the long incubation period due to the naivety of the immune system to the novel virus?"
8001,As Covid recirculates in an endemic fashion is it possible the immune system will react quicker and shorten that incubation period?
8002,Just curious but what would you consider to be real proof?
8003,"Persuasion
The day the Fletchers, the retired couple, spoke about the vaccine with their family physician, Dr. Daniel Lewis, was the one-year anniversary of the day he was put on a ventilator with a severe case of Covid."
8004,"Dr. Lewis, 43, remained hospitalized for over a month."
8005,He was so gravely ill that he recorded farewell messages for his five children.
8006,"Over his 13 years in Greeneville, Dr. Lewis, a volunteer physician for school sports teams and chief medical officer for four Ballad Health regional hospitals, accrued a wide community of support."
8007,"During his illness, people dropped off meals and restaurant gift cards on his porch and kept up a surging prayer chain."
8008,"They mowed his lawn, mulched his flower beds, fixed his truck."
8009,"When he left the hospital, 34 pounds thinner, weak and wobbly, he and his wife, devout Baptists, struggled to figure out God’s purpose behind the ordeal."
8010,"Patients kept telling him, “I didn’t take Covid seriously until you got sick.”

So Dr. Lewis began using that hard-earned credibility to speak about the vaccine, visiting nursing homes, addressing churches, making videos."
8011,"He honed his pitch to meet every pushback, from faux-scientific to conspiratorial to spiritual."
8012,"Although many Appalachians used to resist seeing the doctor, family medicine practitioners like Dr. Lewis are becoming trusted figures."
8013,"But discussing vaccines with patients takes time, which many doctors can’t afford, and an established relationship, which many poor patients don’t have."
8014,Dr. Lewis gives a soft sell that sometimes works.
8015,"A patient will say, “So are you going to give me the vaccine now?”

He has to respond, “I don’t have it here.” The patient shuts down."
8016,"“Then I’m not going to take it.”

Could Dr. Lewis persuade the Fletchers to get the vaccine?"
8017,Mr. Fletcher doesn’t fret about long-term side effects.
8018,"His prostate cancer has returned, one more blow in a Job-like year that saw the unexpected death of his younger son, a paraplegic, and the death of a nephew, an emergency room physician."
8019,A year in which dear friends severed their relationship with the Fletchers because of the couple’s Covid skepticism.
8020,"“When you get older, you think you have no more tears, but then something causes them to come back,” he said in a subdued voice."
8021,"Dr. Lewis patiently addressed the Fletchers’ questions, delineating between what researchers do and don’t yet know."
8022,"“How can we be sure there are no chips in the vaccine, like the things you put in your dog?” Mr. Fletcher asked."
8023,"“We can’t make microchips that small,” Dr. Lewis countered."
8024,"“Well, it’s like a grain of rice,” said Mr. Fletcher."
8025,"“I couldn’t inject a grain of rice with a needle,” Dr. Lewis said."
8026,Dr. Lewis held up his smartphone.
8027,"If you’re worried about being tracked, he said, all the technology is right here, in the very thing you pick up every day."
8028,Every hour.
8029,The Fletchers looked abashed.
8030,"“It’s your decision,” Dr. Lewis said gently."
8031,"“I just want you to be able to make an informed decision and I want to do the best I can to help you.”

Mr. Fletcher replied, “Well, we have to spend some time in discussion.”

Later, Dr. Lewis was optimistic: “I think I can eventually persuade them.”

To date, the Fletchers say they will not take the vaccine."
8032,You shouldn't need to apologize for phone formatting.
8033,A large majority of redditors use mobile exclusively.
8034,"Because Covid actually does damage to people's cardiovascular and nervous system, and the vaccine does not."
8035,They are not the same.

8037,I have friends in India who tell me the media is overhyping they crematoriums.
8038,It’s like one or two rural villages basically
8039,You clearly have not been paying attention.
8040,There is a reason why nurses wear masks when they go into patients rooms.
8041,Masks do help to protect the mask-user.
8042,That is probably the production lag.
8043,It could change.
8044,I think it likely will.
8045,"""We  will continue to work closely with the Centers for Disease Control and  Prevention to evaluate the need for these directives,” LaJoye said."""

8047,"A topic too volatile
So charged have the Covid shots become that many people have adopted a resigned silence."
8048,"A vaccinated 20-something barista has given up trying to persuade her not-now, not-ever father."
8049,"A retired postal worker just lets her doctor assume she’s gotten the shots, because he is a family friend."
8050,But she hasn’t — and won’t.
8051,"Mary Hayes, who drove into Greeneville for a reunion lunch with a large group of vaccinated friends, is accustomed to speaking her mind."
8052,But she has a moral quandary: should she advocate for the vaccine or keep quiet?
8053,"She got the vaccine early, because so many doses went unclaimed."
8054,"In her remote corner of the county, people already look at her warily."
8055,"“A lot of times I have to temper my opinions in order to fit in,” Ms. Hayes said, tears welling in her eyes."
8056,"“I’m walking a line between people refusing to socialize with me or not.”

Ms. Hayes grew up here, left, and returned to care for her mother."
8057,"Late in 2019, while teaching English online to students in China, she noticed that some were disappearing from her computer monitor."
8058,They were succumbing to a mysterious virus.
8059,"Later, when her family went into lockdown, neighbors dismissed her fears."
8060,"“Appalachians were raised to believe they must work and can’t get sick, no matter what,” said Ms. Hayes, who has a graduate degree in Appalachian studies."
8061,"She wept in frustration as familiar names appeared on her prayer chain, deathly ill from the virus."
8062,"On the door of her church, someone recently posted a newspaper letter."
8063,"It derided Covid mask mandates, “the Prophet Fauci” and vaccines “made in part from aborted children.”

The topic of the vaccine has even muted the most influential leaders in Greene County: evangelical pastors."
8064,"There are many who have been vaccinated, like Mr. Smith at Tusculum Baptist, but won’t use the pulpit to support it."
8065,"He doesn’t want to risk alienating anyone, he explained, at a time when he hopes people will return to the church itself to worship."
8066,"After a year of Zoom services, which people call “pajama church,” he fears in-person attendance will drop."
8067,"Daniel Shrader, who leads a small Baptist congregation, is all in on the vaccine."
8068,"He wants church to be safe for the older, hard-of-hearing ladies to whom he’s been preaching during the pandemic by shouting from their porch steps."
8069,"In conversation, he’ll share his vaccine views; in larger gatherings, he sticks to prayer."
8070,The pastors’ perspectives run the gamut.
8071,"Mr. Smucker, the Mennonite pastor, believes that natural herd immunity — let the disease run its course — is a better path than vaccination."
8072,But he won’t preach about it.
8073,"Chelsea Daugherty’s father, a Free Will Baptist pastor, is unsure about getting vaccinated."
8074,"Ms. Daugherty, a sophomore at Tusculum University who got the shot, said her father tells worshipers: “The Lord gave us common sense, so we’ve got to use it.” Make up your own mind."
8075,So which trusted person will speak for the vaccine?
8076,Eva Fields?
8077,She is a nurse-practitioner who treated one of the first local patients to die from Covid.
8078,"Greeneville-raised, she has 24 relatives who had the virus."
8079,"When she asks patients if they will get vaccinated, about half reply, “No and I’m not going to.” Assuming she’ll be angry, they add, “I’m so sorry if that upsets you!”

Miss Fields responds, “That’s OK, honey."
8080,"I’m not planning to, either.”

Her gut tells her to believe a video someone sent her from a far-right misinformation group, in which a ranter said studies showed that vaccines caused plaque in the brain."
8081,"Like others here, she is suspicious of Bill Gates’s involvement in vaccine development."
8082,"One evening at supper, Dr. Theo Hensley, a vaccine proponent in her office, retorted: “I don’t know Bill Gates but I do know that Dolly Parton gave a million bucks.” (Ms. Parton is northeast Tennessee’s favorite daughter.)"
8083,"“Well, she’s probably OK,” Miss Fields allowed."
8084,"“When someone pushes something really hard, I sit back, because I don’t like people telling me, ‘This is what you need to do,’ ” Miss Fields said."
8085,"Echoing many others, she added, “I need to do my own research.”

For now, she neither urges nor discourages patients to get the vaccine."

8087,I find it interesting that this is happening over one year from the original outbreak.

8103,The truth is somewhere in between.
8104,Unvaccinated people can still pass the virus to vaccinated people.

8115,"What’s the point, they ask?"
8116,The government still wants you to wear a mask indoors.
8117,"“I just don’t see any benefits,” said Mrs. Fletcher, as the couple waited to see their family doctor."
8118,Neither the science nor statistics of the new vaccine daunt them.
8119,"Now retired and in their 70s, Mr. Fletcher was a telecom engineer, Mrs. Fletcher, a secretary and accounting clerk."
8120,"But the Fletchers, Free Will Baptists, worry the vaccine includes aborted fetal parts (it doesn’t)."
8121,"They don’t trust the government, convinced it has long manipulated Covid case numbers."
8122,"“I just think we have been hornswoggled,” Mr. Fletcher said."
8123,"People don’t put much stock in pronouncements by politicians, but they do trust Walt Cross, the proprietor of the Mustard Seed, a shop in Newport just over the county line, that takes its name from the Gospel of Matthew and carries herbs, nutritional supplements and local produce."
8124,"Mr. Cross, who is also a volunteer fire chief for Cocke County, is a tall, lanky east Tennessean with a blue-eyed focus and a warm mountain drawl, whether he’s describing his preferred method to rouse people who have overdosed (ammonia rather than Narcan) or answering questions from Covid patients about how to treat their symptoms (hydrate, eat, take herbal extracts, apply hot and cold compresses)."
8125,"Before going to the doctor, many people phone Mr. Cross."
8126,Or after the doctor’s medicines don’t seem to be working.
8127,"Although his father died of Covid, Mr. Cross won’t get the vaccine."
8128,“We jumped into bed with the vaccine too fast!” he said.
8129,"While he won’t tell people to get it or not, he says pointedly, “Do your due diligence.”

Mr. Cross, who lectures around the country and in Rwanda about preventive wellness, is studying for an advanced degree in naturopathic medicine."
8130,"His shop evokes themes dear to Appalachians, with people calling these early April weeks the “redbud winter” — the spring chill during which redbud trees swell with mauve-pink blossoms."
8131,"A store wall is lined with Mason jars filled with herbaceous plants like jewelweed, passionflower and elderberry, which Appalachians were taught to use by the Cherokee."
8132,"He scoffs at the perception that people here are vaccine-hesitant simply because they, like him, are Republicans."
8133,"“That doesn’t make sense to me,” he said."
8134,"“Trump brought the vaccine in.” If this was about political affiliation, he continued, “you’d jump and take it!” Instead, he said, people think the vaccine is too entwined with politics."
8135,"In Appalachia, Mr. Cross explained, the fervor with which people sidestep the vaccine is ratcheted up by history and tradition."
8136,"For centuries, Scots-Irish settlers tucked into the mountains to evade army conscription and tax collectors."
8137,"Jeremy Faison, a longtime Republican state representative who grew up in the area, agrees: “Throughout the pandemic, there are a lot of us who are like, ‘It’s a serious situation but me and my family can take care of ourselves.’ ”

Mr. Faison, a libertarian and an evangelical Christian, added, “So we take exception with the government putting mandates on us, pressuring us to do something.”

That view is bolstered by a religious, near-joyous fatalism."
8138,"People say that if they haven’t caught Covid a year into the pandemic, they will take their chances."
8139,"True, they might get Covid and die."
8140,"But either way, a win-win: longer life on Earth or, for the faithful, eternal life in Heaven."
8141,"“There’s a time appointed for every person to die,” said Reuben Smucker, a Mennonite pastor in Greeneville who works as a garage-door installer."
8142,"“We should take care of our bodies physically, emotionally and spiritually, but if it’s my time to go and it’s by Covid, well then, it’s my time to go.”

8163,I believe regulators have decided that blood clots should be listed as possible side effects of the J&amp;J and Astra-Zeneca vaccines.
8164,"I don’t think the link has be shown conclusively, but at this point is does look likely that the adenovirus vector vaccines are causing an unusual cases of clotting (which should not be conflated with typical cases of clotting because they are in fact different and can’t be treated with the typical treatments)."

8168,"Yes, they can mandate it once it reaches full FDA approval as well they should."
8169,But they can’t until then
8170,It’s not being mandated at public universities until it reaches full FDA approval.
8171,"Sure it’s safe, I scheduled my vaccine the day it opened to me."

8181,“I think it’s none of their business.
8182,"And it’s just dividing people.”

As the beautiful Appalachian spring unfurls across northeastern Tennessee, the Covid-19 vaccine is tearing apart friends, families, congregations, colleagues."
8183,"“It’s a muddy mess,” said Meredith Shrader, a physician assistant, who runs an events venue with her husband, another pastor, and who notes that the choice has become about much more than health care."
8184,"“Which voice do you listen to?”

Communities like Greeneville and its surroundings — rural, overwhelmingly Republican, deeply Christian, 95 percent white — are on the radar of President Biden and American health officials, as efforts to vaccinate most of the U.S. population enters a critical phase."
8185,These are the places where polls show resistance to the vaccine is most entrenched.
8186,"While campaigns aimed at convincing Black and Latino urban communities to set aside their vaccine mistrust have made striking gains, towns like these will also have to be convinced if the country is to achieve widespread immunity."
8187,"But a week here in Greene County reveals a more nuanced, layered hesitancy than surveys suggest."
8188,People say that politics isn’t the leading driver of their vaccine attitudes.
8189,"The most common reason for their apprehension is fear — that the vaccine was developed in haste, that long-term side effects are unknown."
8190,"Their decisions are also entangled in a web of views about bodily autonomy, science and authority, plus a powerful regional, somewhat romanticized self-image: We don’t like outsiders messing in our business."
8191,"According to state health department statistics, 31 percent of the vaccine-eligible population in Greene County has gotten at least one dose of a Covid vaccine, still below Tennessee overall, which has one of the lowest rates in the country, and far below the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s national tally of 55 percent."
8192,"While many older residents have been inoculated, now that eligibility is open to all adults, vaccination sites are almost desolate."
8193,"Still, conversations here show that for many people, resistance is not firm."
8194,"Roiled by internet fallacies, many hunger for straightforward information from people they trust."
8195,"Others have practical needs, like paid time off to recover from side effects, which the Biden administration has urged employers to offer, or the opportunity to get the shot from their own doctor."
8196,What’s also lacking is a groundswell that might encourage the hesitant to make the leap: Many people who have gotten vaccinated are remaining tight-lipped.
8197,"....so basically wildlife conservation, right?"
8198,"Sorry to hear that, it’s absolutely devastating to see what is happening."
8199,I’m in the US and also know plenty of “educated” folks who are anti vax.
8200,Took awhile to convince my family but they finally got on board.

8254,Some of them as early as January.
8255,If the vaccines had any long term side effects we wouldve heard about by now.
8256,"I agree they saw no benefit, and jumped at an opportunity to say no to something, even if its not in their best interest."
8257,DOD recently authorized paid recovery days for those who get the vaccine - I feel like that will also incentivize people (plenty of civilians who work for the military have also been reluctant to get it).
8258,I think a suggestion like this is a bit dangerous.
8259,Best to encourage everyone to follow their doctor’s advice and guidelines from disease professionals.
8260,"""equitable"" is a shit term."
8261,You made it - you use it.
8262,"Don't know why people are downvoting, this is true."
8263,Canadian currently living in the US and even my 17 year old stepson was vaccinated before my 60 y-o parents became eligible in Canada.
8264,Canada is spacing out its 2nd dose by over 3 months... My parents were vaccinated mid April and scheduled for dose 2 early August.
8265,"I've been fully vaccinated for weeks at 35, yet most people 59 and younger aren't eligible yet in Canada for just the first dose."
8266,It won’t be wiped out.
8267,It’ll be an endemic virus but after a few years it’ll just be another one of the 4 coronavirus common colds we already deal with.
8268,A virus which has an animal reservoir like this one can never be wiped out because there’s always the possibility it’ll jump from animal to human again.
8269,Im also afraid.. lol.
8270,I couldn't look.
8271,I felt it too it wasn't too bad until she injected the fluid and it was hurting like hell.
8272,Started throbbing for a while as the liquid moved inside.
8273,"&gt;If those poor countries didn't have enough money, should global vaccine distribution be based on fatness of a country's wallet?"
8274,Yes.
8275,This is how it works.
8276,Then why didn’t they go the mRNA route?

8284,And whhhhhyyy?
8285,"You’ve come this far, just do it, please."
8286,I think this one is more likely to work itself out due to generous unemployment supports.
8287,"I'm actually far more worried about the housing market in the medium term, along with inflation to a lesser degree."
8288,I'm an accountant and work in finance.
8289,"I think there is a lot of positives on the horizon, but the relationship between inflation and how hot the housing market is is rather worrying."
8290,"If inflation ticks up significantly, the only effective tool we have to combat that is to raise interest rates."
8291,"If we raise interest rates it will cause an economic contraction at a vulnerable time, along with exposing the potential for another financial crisis in the housing market similar to 2008 (a sudden hike in interest rates could cause a wave in subprime defaults, of which I have no doubt there is plenty of at the moment)."
8292,He is not alone
8293,"Between the country being generally worse off financially, and having over a billion people in a country where so many people are crammed so close together Im surprised it took as long as it did for the shit to hit the fan."
8294,Frankly India shouldve been one of the first countries to get hit hard.
8295,Keeping what you make is not hoarding.
8296,Luckily my company is pretty liberal so everyone is doing it.. lol
8297,"True, but which other first world country has the same cobblestone streets and structures like the Pantheon where the ancient Romans once trod on the same ground as you."
8298,I'll always remember my first glimpse of the Pantheon coming out from a side street right behind it.
8299,"That, and being fortunate enough to have a special after hours tour of the Sistine Chapel to take in the wonderful creation made by Michaelangelo and human hands."
8300,Fascinating!
8301,Doesnt see so.
8302,"Both ny parents are in China rn and they didnt need to, even for travel (inside the country)."
8303,This might be different province to province doh.
8304,"It's been less than 2 weeks since vaccines became available to all adults in the US, and MLB's metric includes the post-injection period required to build immunity."
8305,"And anti-vax aside (there certainly are some), many of the guys that got vaccinated have been out for a day or two or three with side effects."
8306,"That's fine if you're a star with a big multi-year contract, but for guys on the fringe, it could be the difference between staying in the big leagues or not."
8307,As a Canadian living in the US right now but with all my family in Canada... Canada has been one of the worst countries for the vaccine.
8308,"My state has been open to everyone over 16 for over a month, and most states have as well."
8309,I'm 35 and got my second shot the day my 60 year old parents were able to get their first one and their second shot is not until August because Canada is spacing out doses by almost  3 months instead of 3 weeks for Pfizer.
8310,"There's lot of things to be proud about, but Canada's handling of the vaccine isn't really one."
8311,[removed]
8312,Grow up
8313,"I think I should be good to go now - I hadn’t gotten a shot (or had bloodwork) for over a decade, since I passed our having my blood drawn during a physical when I was 19 or so."
8314,"I barely felt the COVID needle, so I’m hoping that shot 2 will be better now that my irrational fear has (hopefully) subsided."
8315,"Luckily I did the drive-thru vaccine spot for my first one, and my wife drove me."
8316,So I just passed out in the passenger seat.
8317,"Came back after 5-10 seconds, drank some water, opened the windows, and was back to feeling almost normal in about 15-30 minutes."
8318,When is the hearing?
8319,I haven't heard anything on that.
8320,"The Government certainly doesn't seem to be expediting things on this front, which is disappointing."
8321,Is this an informed statement?
8322,Because it has been widely reported that the new variants in circulation in India are causing younger demographics to become substantially more ill at a far higher rate (likely due to increased viral load per Anthony Fauci).
8323,"I take your point around sensationalizing, but this isn't that."
8324,[removed]
8325,I mean just to play devil's advocate here what other vaccine uses this same MRNA mechanism that is used.
8326,"There is none, we legitimately don't know the long term effects."
8327,The same could be said for any Eurasian-zone country sans the Baltics.
8328,Dude who gives AF?
8329,"Except that everyone I encountered here was saying that there was no evidence that this virus would mutate to spread faster, to younger people, or to reinfect people."
8330,The experts keep saying these things are possible.
8331,"Nobody should fixate on that, but neither should we deny it."
8332,"If we're going to get past it, then we need to face the facts as they are."
8333,[removed]
8334,Im in a situation where if I get it I am first on the list to come back into work instead of telework so I kind of am in no rush...
8335,"The US has been hoarding vaccines for 4 months, barely exporting."
8336,It's time to step up.
8337,There have been deaths after one dose and some after two.
8338,The vaccines work very very well but break throughs are possible especially after only one dose.
8339,"For example:

https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2021/04/13/986411423/a-mystery-under-study-how-why-and-when-covid-vaccines-arent-fully-protective

From the article : “Though these sorts of breakthrough infections have been reported among people of all ages, a little more than 40% so far have been among people age 60 or older, according to the agency, and 65% of such cases have been among women."
8340,"About 29% of those experiencing breakthrough infections experienced no symptoms, but 7% were hospitalized and 74 people died.”"
8341,"Well, he says he’s going to, and I don’t have any reason not to take that claim at face value."
8342,Damn that guy who let me cut in front of him for some reason!
8343,I thought it seemed suspicious at the time!
8344,"Not gonna lie it kinda sucks, but I can deal with it."
8345,Young mothers into natural and green stuff are one of the leaders of the anti-vaxx movement.
8346,[removed]
8347,Doesn’t seem all that crazy to incentivize people with another stimulus check to get the shot.
8348,We’ve already given out 2000+ to every person.
8349,What’s a few hundred more to encourage more people to take the shot?
8350,Agreed.
8351,Need to give as many rewards as safely possible to encourage vaccinations.
8352,"Measles levels is the likely endpoint here, so universal childhood vaccination with occasional flare ups amongst unvaccinated communities."
8353,Perhaps even elimination like Polio and Smallpox?
8354,That might be a bit of a stretch though.
8355,&gt; The Transportation Security Administration announced Friday that it is extending its face mask requirement across all U.S. transportation settings.
8356,"&gt; Until at least Sept. 13, individuals will have to continue wearing face coverings at locations including airports, onboard commercial aircraft, on over-the-road buses, and on commuter bus and rail systems, according to the TSA."
8357,&gt; The agency’s initial mask rule went into effect Feb. 1 and was set to expire May 11.
8358,The US military does stuff all around the world to help keep some regions or nations safer.
8359,I absolutely felt mine—it hurt like hell.
8360,"And I don’t mind needles, but it still hurt."
8361,It seems every college that takes federal funds should be required to do this.
8362,The US sent a bunch of AZ vaccine up north.
8363,It makes perfect sense to prioritize Mexico and Canada.
8364,Both those countries had vaccine coverage of like 2% last week.
8365,Americans frequently visit those countries.
8366,Mexico actually has been talking about building a wall for 15 years now- so yeah it wasn’t Trump’s idea.
8367,What's with the commas?
8368,Not '.
8369,'?
8370,this made me physically cringe
8371,no
8372,Why are we doing things to seniors that cause them this much anxiety?
8373,Why does getting old mean you have to relinquish bodily and mental autonomy?
8374,Vaccine diplomacy from the US will be ramping up in the coming months
8375,No but certainly their unstable behavior every time anyone is questioning their product will be taken into account.
8376,Vaccine supply issues in the EU is a thing of the past.
8377,"By all means, I’m happy if people are saved by this vaccine, but for the EU this package doesn’t make sense."
8378,LARP more
8379,Not for everyone
8380,This pandemic showed us peak stupidity and human ingenuity at the same time.
8381,Ignoring all of the plastics that are in our environment now.
8382,Tiny dicks and low sperm count.
8383,The vaccine is the least of our worries when it comes to reproduction.
8384,"Booking an appointment is opening up in 2 weeks, not the actual shot to everyone in line."
8385,nice cherry pick.
8386,"what we do know are the facts, and those facts are that florida is a hotspot while california is not."
8387,"we also know that floridas vaccine rollout has faltered and stalled out, while other states, even ones like texas, is smashing florida."
8388,whats going on?
8389,There’s tens of y’all out there I’m sure
8390,"Fact is, on January 6th we saw what republicans are capable of."

8408,Gotta love the stupidity too.
8409,"Second flight I took since corona and there's masks and all this theater, but hey total face to face pat down of the crotch and ass?"
8410,Guess that's totally safe!
8411,Nice cherry pick.
8412,"Over the course of the pandemic, Florida has slightly more deaths / cases per capita than California (despite an older population)."
8413,I can play the same game as you and show you December January when California was a disaster and Florida was doing relatively well.
8414,"So weird, why did coronavirus spread so rapidly in California while being muted in Florida, despite a strict lockdown?"
8415,Did every Californian misbehave at the same time in December/January then suddenly behave in February?
8416,"But fine, if you just care about the last week, let's compare Michigan and Florida."
8417,"Michigan, a lockdown state, has triple the cases per capita."
8418,What's going on?
8419,It’s been in California for awhile.
8420,Stop posting scare tactic articles OP
8421,Detroit Tigers and New York Yankees are two of the nine teams.
8422,I don't think those would apply.
8423,"It's a school rule, not a country rule."
8424,My dad's friend is safely back in the US.
8425,"He managed to not get COVID while there so I guess Moderna works ok against the Indian variant, though I don't know how well he social distanced while there so he could have just not been exposed."
8426,"Oh, it's actually that I believe the opposite."
8427,"We don't lock down for the flu every year even though people die, and I don't think we should have locked down for covid even though it would mean people would die."
8428,The numbers don't really matter to me because I care about the principle - is it worth locking down to save lives or not?
8429,"I dislike the idea of drawing some arbitrary line and saying ""If a disease kills more than &lt;insert random number&gt; people then we should lock down, and if it kills less we shouldn't""."
8430,The reason of course is because that number is just completely random and it essentially allows the government to just lock down whenever they feel like because we don't have any logical cutoff point that we could fall back on.

8439,"I'm 24, but I was born in 1996 and I'm turning 25 this year."

8441,Ughh really?
8442,75-80% of the country will be fully vaccinated by July.
8443,We really still need masks by that time?
8444,Airplane air recirculates every 3-5 minutes.
8445,It’s 100% safer than being in Walmart.

8448,[deleted]
8449,"I honestly thought military folks would be the first to get the shots, I'm surprised this is just now being discussed."
8450,Wouldn’t a new variant from India favor transmission over lethality?
8451,"Any new variant in order to remain dominant would need to spread the farthest and fastest, and that’s only achievable by being minimally pathogenic."
8452,Technically all of your questions asked here need a lot of studies to prove out what is and isn't effective.
8453,Nobody on this board or really on earth could give you answers that held much weight.
8454,There just hasn't been enough studies done yet to definitively answer these questions.
8455,Basically the us plays it extremely safe always when it comes to drugs.
8456,The fda is not perfect (see aids crisis) but they tend to be more stringent and research focused than other countries.
8457,For that reason the fda and by extension cdc will generally not support anything outside of the tested and approved protocols.
8458,It may seem inefficient at times but it is generally the safer approach.
8459,I think you are underestimating the challenge of trying to vaccinate staff that are probably spread out all over the place.
8460,"Scouts, coaches, player development staff, front office officials and other non-player employees are literally all over the country."
8461,"Its not as simple as ""everybody show up to work on X day and get a shot"""

8468,That's why this entire sub is hoping for covid to last longer.

8470,[deleted]
8471,"You can continue to be a hermit as long as you want, even after covid, you know that right?"
8472,"That would require the virus to mutate over to animals, mutate some more, and then mutate back to humans again."
8473,"At that point, you'd basically be saying never lift restrictions because the next pandemic can come around and would be more likely than Covid coming from animals again."
8474,"&gt;The Nikkei newspaper reported that the Covid-19 outbreak in India forced Suzuki, Honda and Toyota to temporarily suspend production in India when the government urged manufacturers to convert oxygen used in industry to use for consumption."
8475,medical destination.
8476,Ah I see what you’re saying.
8477,I hope that happens too
8478,[removed]
8479,"Yeah, it was pretty terrible."
8480,"But now that's what people are used to, so now they say four months and people think it'll be *even longer*."
8481,That doesn't help either.
8482,[deleted]
8483,lol you are completely wrong and its obvious from your bias that you havent done your research.
8484,"california has 28.8 cases per 100k people in the last week, florida is at 170.2. deaths are also higher in florida, and florida is currently lagging behind other big states in terms of vaccinations."
8485,"hell, even texas has vaccinated more adults than florida has, as has new york and california."
8486,basically florida is a mess that every floridian is aware of
8487,You have evidence of a god?
8488,You should share it.
8489,You will literally be remembered forever in history.
8490,"Yes, but remember these vaccines are made with equipments, using ingredients that were effectively unaccessible for the rest of the world due to the export ban."
8491,It’s such a tragedy if these insanely limited resources go down the trash can.
8492,You just can’t get an education?…
8493,This pandemic has made all of my blue collar and manual labor family members into virologists lol

8577,Brazilian authorities just said that they did not test the vaccine and the existence of replicating capable adenovirus (RCA) was taken from Sputnik’s own paperwork sent to them for approval.
8578,"In that paperwork they guarantee that in case of RCA, it will not pass a specific threshold."

8584,"Personally, I caught covid in October and my gf who I sleep with every night did not get infected."
8585,The only possible outcome I can see as to why she wasn’t sick is maybe she infected me and she had no symptoms?
8586,It’s just all strange to me because growing up in a big family usually when someone catches a cold or the flu that means the whole family was gonna catch it naturally.
8587,Something about covid and it’s infectious rate just seems overhyped to me but then again I’m not a doctor or epidemiologist so I’ll just listen to their advice lol

Well they are the same people who thought our vaccination rate in Feb will mean everyone gets a vaccine in 2022 and there is absolutely no way the vaccination rate can increase."

8668,"Also, the first tranche of 20,000 doses of experimental Covid-19 drug Remdesivir is expected to reach India this week."
8669,"Foreign secretary Harsh Shringla said in a briefing Thursday that over 40 nations are pitching in with urgently needed resources and countries that India had supplied essential pharmaceutical products including hydroxychloroquine, paracetamol and Remdesivir have come forward to help."
8670,Official sources said the United States has agreed to divert 20 million vaccine doses to India but a timeline for the same is yet to be specified.
8671,It is believed that the US has 10 million doses in stock while another 50 million are to be manufactured over the next two months.
8672,India is also in touch with China to ensure cargo flights remain operational as a large number of medical supplies are being sourced.
8673,“A large number of cargo flights are operational.
8674,"Sichuan airlines, that has 10 flights a day, suspended operations and that has had an impact on supplies from there."
8675,"We will be in touch with authorities in China to have as much of this connectivity open,” Shringla said."
8676,"While over 22 tonnes of medical supplies, including oxygen plants, arrived from Russia on Wednesday, first supplies from the United States are expected to land on Friday morning, with three military aircraft set to bring in medicines and oxygen related equipment."
8677,"The United States will also send 20,000 courses of Remdesivir antiviral drug by early next week."
8678,In addition it will be supplying Millipore filters from its own stocks that will enable the manufacturing of 18 million AstraZeneca doses in India at the earliest.
8679,17 oxygen generator plants are also likely to be sent across.
8680,"In all, India is expected to get 550 oxygen generating plants from partners across the world."

8682,"The US is committed to send 1,700 oxygen concentrators to obtain oxygen from ambient air, these mobile units provide options for flexible patient treatment, a statement from White House said."
8683,"India will also receive oxygen generation units, these are multiple large-scale units to support up to 20 patients each, and additional mobile units that will provide an ability to target specific shortages."
8684,"A team of US experts will support these units, working hand-in-hand on the ground with Indian medical personnel, the White House said."
8685,"Messages of support are pouring in from across the globe, including a statement by Italian PM Mario Draghi pledging medical supplies."
8686,"“Through our Civil Protection Department, we are ready for sending an oxygen production system, made available by the Piedmont Region for supplies to a traditional hospital or a field structure."
8687,"A team of specialised personnel is also ready to start for ensuring operation of the equipment,"" he said."
8688,The Indian Navy will help bring in a 40 mt og oxygen shipment that has been gifted by Bahrain while 185 mt is expected from Kuwait.
8689,"India is also looking to procure Remdesivir from Egypt, besides exploring other options to import the medicine."
8690,Manufacturer Gilead has already promised 4.5 lakh doses of the medicine to India.
8691,Here’s the entire article.
8692,"Where does it imply ""we'll divert our order from there to stay in India.""?"
8693,The article clear states “It is believed that the US has 10 million doses in stock while another 50 million are to be manufactured over the next two months.” So at least 10m finished in stock in the US already.

8857,*
8858,It’s not just India look at all of South Asia and Southeast Asia.
8859,"There are also those who claim 100% protection against hospitalizations and death, which are also annoying and harmful (antivaxxers then point at any death and say ""see, vaccines don't work"")."
8860,This is absolutely brilliant.
8861,If you gave 5 “$10” scratch tickets with it (you could even make COVID-themed scratch tickets with much lower odds/payouts)!!!
8862,This is such a good idea.
8863,You are a genius.
8864,Have you been tested yet?
8865,"Staying home until you feel like death is wrong., the sicker you are, the harder it is to treat."
8866,"If you feel that sick, go to the doctor, or call your doctor or do a telemedicine visit."
8867,"Who ""trolls"" about something like this?"
8868,"Honestly it's not even trolling, they're just a liar."
8869,By July I think everyone will be doing full capacity.
8870,It won’t even be news anymore.
8871,I disagree with this metric of population density.
8872,Ontario is absolutely huge.
8873,Overall population of the province is 13.6 million people with total land area of around 920 million squared km.
8874,The Greater Toronto Area is 7 thousand km squared and has a population of 6.5 million.
8875,"If we look at Canada, it's a huge country, but how much of it is actually inhabited?"
8876,90 percent of Canada's population lives within 160 km of the US border.
8877,"I don't think the population density of where Canadians actually live would differ from the US as much as people would think, though I don't know how to actually calculate this."
8878,I definitely had COVID before both of my Pfizer vaccines and this definitely makes sense.
8879,My first shot was the one that gave me the most side effects.
8880,"I was able to power right through dose 2, thankfully."
8881,How comes?
8882,Germany's vaccination rate is a tad higher.
8883,I got my first shot yesterday and was really lucky to be vaccinated this early.
8884,We aren’t required to wear one...I would 100% wear a mask whenever required.
8885,"The article is about Los Angeles, not Louisiana."
8886,Yep.
8887,The DoD mandate for quarantine is gone but still requires that they follow the host nations requirements.
8888,As countries begin allowing shorter or no quarantine for vaccinated persons the DoD has more and more incentive to make it mandatory.
8889,[removed]
8890,Too bad Uncle Donny won’t to a Vaccine Public Service Announcement.
8891,He obviously believes in them as he got his shots in January.

8897,"No, for now it’s just Coronavirus that exploded all over the US because stupid people refuse to wear masks or take Coronavirus vaccines."
8898,It’s not only being used in under-50’s is where you were wrong.
8899,The UK approach with priority groups is that currently those who are eligible to get the vaccine should be at some risk due to health/workplace if they are under the age of 40 hence why I think the UK have partly made that choice.
8900,I do agree with you that we will follow suit with Europe eventually but you have to remember the UK made its calls with AZ when we were being severely fucked by Covid

8908,Asians are getting attacked all over America.
8909,"Indians and Asians are easily identifiable, Brits and South Africans are not."
8910,Race is not same as nationality.
8911,I am in the same boat as your family members.
8912,Had covid in late Oct last year and got my second Moderna shot in  March.
8913,"What I will say is that AT PEAK, the vax side effects were worse, but they didn't last long."

8920,Lockdowns are a first world option.
8921,There are people who will slide food down their throats if and ONLY IF they earn money on THAT day.
8922,"I understand your sentiment, but the demographic in India is a lot more complicated than the nice and even average western country

Edit: We do have lockdowns in urban centres such as Delhi"
8923,"&gt;Fear is strong

So true, sad to see the lives of so many people impacted by fear of the vaccine :("
8924,"Yep, same here."
8925,"And I have never had any fear of/issues with needles, not even as a kid."
8926,"Hi, I want to better understand the correlation between covid cases and economic costs of NPIs."
8927,"My impression was that you essentially pay for the reproduction number, i.e."
8928,"cutting cases in half costs more or less a fixed price, independent from the total number of cases."
8929,"Except that tracing and tracking ressources are finite, so it should be slightly cheaper if the case numbers are low, that's why I support zeroish covid strategies."
8930,"But I'm a bit perplexed by the developments in Germany and Switzerland, Switzerland had much more cases during the second wave but is now pretty much on par with Germany, yet I heard a few times that the Switzerland spent less money on NPIs."
8931,"That's agains my logic, as I would assume they saved some money in the first half of the second wave, where they allowed for a greater reproduction number, but then they crunched the numbers faster than Germany, so they should have spent more money in this timespan."
8932,Where's the flaw in my thinking?
8933,Suppose you were already sick this year in excess of your 'allowed sick time'?
8934,Suppose you don't get paid sick leave?
8935,Shitty take
8936,My first one was excrutiatingly painful.
8937,I honestly think the woman did it wrong because my arm hurt and I had a bruise for over a month.
8938,My second didn't hurt too much and my arm was back to normal after a couple days but I definitely felt it.
8939,And I don't usually feel shots or even blood draws at all.
8940,"I definitely don't want to discourage anyone, just being honest."
8941,I'm not sure it's all that helpful when people only claim they didn't even feel it and had no effects.
8942,"I got Moderna, fwiw."
8943,These are big numbers.
8944,But India has 1.4B population - twice than whole Europe.
8945,In number of deaths or cases per population India is in second hundred of all countries.
8946,Compare it to South America and especially Brazil.
8947,India and Brazil has same amount of tests per million (200k).
8948,But Brazil has 5x more cases per million and more than 10times of deaths per million.
8949,Cases/deaths in both countries are under-reported too.
8950,And cases in South America are ramping up too.
8951,Even in richer countries who hasn't big problems before (like Uruguay).
8952,I believe in certain hotspot postal codes anyone over 18 can get it

8987,Oh so this is a political sub now.
8988,Edgy
8989,For people who are actually curious: [even with the current delivery schedule nobody will actually end up waiting that long](https://www.reddit.com/r/vancouver/comments/n1dk5f/bc_says_it_expects_to_have_enough_vaccines_to/gwdgaor/).
8990,"That's not factoring in that the US is already loosening up exports, which means they're likely coming close to hitting their ""enough doses for every American"" promise, at which point they're going to fully open up exports."
8991,[removed]
8992,There was news that Pfizer started exporting from the US yesterday to Canada and Mexico
8993,Canada's provinces put a delay in starting on March 1st in BC and around the 8th-10th in other provinces.
8994,"The delay they put in was for 16 weeks, but [even with the current delivery schedule nobody will actually end up waiting that long](https://www.reddit.com/r/vancouver/comments/n1dk5f/bc_says_it_expects_to_have_enough_vaccines_to/gwdgaor/), and when you consider that the US loosening up exports means that they're probably coming close to hitting their ""enough doses for every American"" promise, at which point they're going to fully open up exports, you'd be crazy to think it'll stay that long."
8995,I just gave my toddler  a syringe(without a needle) and we play with it.
8996,Sometimes we play dockter then she can jab me with it or her stuffed animals.
8997,Sometimes we use is as a water gun etc.
8998,Now she just watches when the needle go's in for vacinations without problems.
8999,It's impossible to hide actual deaths of people on such a scale.
9000,"It's not a single number, we have publicly available data down to individual cities or even registration offices in city districts, so you need a conspiracy involving tens of thousands of people."
9001,"The population also indirectly influences many other publicly available social and economic indicators, and there are many smart people analyzing all the social and economic data."
9002,Any inconsistencies would be found.
9003,"US has shown that repeatedly for decades, it didn't change anything."
9004,America First was always bipartisan.
9005,"According to the article, only 31% percent of the eligible people in this county have had at least one dose of the vaccine."
9006,In LA it was 54% 2 days ago.
9007,It's not remotely comparable.
9008,Hope someone is making a documentary about it.
9009,"Pains me to say that plenty of kooks think that here in BC, as well."
9010,But Alberta does have some of the highest anti-vaxxer and vaccine hesitancy rates in Canada.
9011,"this in a country where in the last one year, 75 million MORE were pushed below the level of $2/day income."
9012,What would be the point of herd immunity if it's only achieved via the entire population getting infected and millions dying?
9013,"Herd immunity isn't supposed to be a goal in itself, it's supposed to prevent future infections and deaths by making sure the population at large is essentially unable to be a breeding ground for the virus."
9014,"If just as many (or even more) people die in an attempt to gain herd immunity through natural infection, whom would we have protected?"
9015,"People need to stop thinking ""herd immunity good, therefore, letting the virus run rampant also good""."
9016,Herd immunity is only good if not many people die by getting there (I.e.
9017,if it's achieved by vaccinating people).
9018,"So, yes, the country would probably reach herd immunity faster without restrictions, but at what price?"
9019,"- If everyone gets sick at once, the Healthcare system can't take care of the people who have to go to the hospital, but survive if they get there."
9020,"This means the death rate could increase by a lot, because all of the people in the ""will die without going to a hospital, but will survive once in the hospital"" category will die (which is like 5-10% of the population, depending on the age group)."
9021,This is one of the most important reasons why we've been trying to keep cases as low as possible in most countries (with varying degrees of success).
9022,"- Even if only 1% of patients died, 1% of 1.36 billion infected people is a fuckton of people (roughly 13.6 million)."
9023,"- With every infection, the virus has a chance to mutate."
9024,"Having the virus run rampant would be an ideal way to breed more variants, because it would mean more people get infected and therefore the chances of mutation increase."
9025,Most of the variants we've seen so far come from populations that had massive outbreaks.
9026,"We don't know how dangerous future variants might be, but it's best not to take any chances"
9027,Personal choice.
9028,Wear a mask forever if you want.
9029,"Forcing other people too is just a power trip, after a certain point."
9030,profiteering both by state and business.
9031,"Massive spending on vanity projects like monuments, personal aircraft, leaders residence is going on RIGHT NOW."
9032,"Now the worse part - There is a 12% GST on Covid aid from abroad, which doesn't come via ICRC."
9033,"There is 12% GST on medical oxygen, 5% on Covid vaccines, 28% on ambulance, 5% for PPE below Rs 1,000 and 12% for the rest; Plus 12%, 5%, 12% 18% GST on test kits, masks, ventilators &amp; sanitisers."
9034,Scary thought except that a virus does not *need* anything.
9035,It doesn't work that way.
9036,Mutations are random and happen all the time.
9037,The mutations that stick are simply those that make that particular strain spread better.
9038,"If anything, a dense populated area would create more mutations because it would spread from host to host more often."
9039,It's a stupid idea and will have adverse effect
9040,For the moment.
9041,"It may suggest we're about to get 2.5+ million doses of AstraZeneca, and/or that the US is closing in on having enough doses for themselves and will announce that they're fully opening exports soon."
9042,Thank you America!
9043,!
9044,[removed]
9045,Read the profile.
9046,It is a troll
9047,"It's one thing to say there are breakthough cases, there always are with vaccines, but to say that one day the vaccines we have will be totally useless because the virus had mutated so much not even T-cells would recognize it is complete speculation and not based on any currently available data."
9048,"In my opinion, that type of argument only dissuades people from getting vaccinated because they're thinking ""Why would I get vaccinated if it's gonna be useless in a couple of months"" which is incredibly far from the truth"
9049,"There is a 12% GST on Covid aid from abroad, which doesn't come via ICRC."
9050,"There is 12% GST on medical oxygen, 5% on Covid vaccines, 28% on ambulance, 5% for PPE below Rs 1,000 and 12% for the rest; Plus 12%, 5%, 12% 18% GST on test kits, masks, ventilators &amp; sanitisers."
9051,I had covid in between shots and the second one kicked my ass.
9052,"The side effects were worse than actual covid, for me."
9053,Weird.
9054,"I had it in July and my first dose just made me tired, my second one gave me awful side effects for 2 days."
9055,Bodies are so strange.
9056,99% survival rate if you get medical attention.
9057,"That drops down to below 95% or lower if the health system is overwhelmed like it is in India, and that’s without taking into account the medical attention needed for other ailments."
9058,Please don't have children.
9059,"Well, I would imagine his biggest concern is that if he orders it before it has received full authorization, someone could challenge that order in court and win."
9060,And that would make things much worse.
9061,That's me and I'm loving the five bar 5G reception everywhere I go!
9062,"I doubt the vaccine procrastinators are giving much thought, if any, to TSA rules about masks."
9063,"Their procrastination is more psychological, and dare I say existential, TSA rules to mean much to them."
9064,Good.
9065,Take the kids and never give them back.
9066,"You're ""fortunate"" to have been infected previously, although if you're trying to crunch risk odds, the odds of re-infection, while not high, seem greater than vaccine issues."
9067,Getting covid doesn't provide as much protection as getting vaccinated.
9068,"Plus, it's a much slower process."
9069,In the US there's been about 32 million covid cases in over a 1 year vs. about 144 million partial vaccinations in a couple of months.
9070,"And the longer it goes, the more chance for mutations that will break past our immunity."
9071,Same here.
9072,"But the aches, chills only lasted about 10 hours then just went away."
9073,Also Moderna.
9074,How long have yours lasted?
9075,Oh Messi Messi Messi
9076,"No, the sentiment is that people are scared of something they've never experienced before."
9077,"Instead of trying to quell each other's fears, people are demonizing each other."
9078,So you want to compare to the US when you’re doing better (Covid deaths) but not when you’re doing worse (vaccinations?
9079,Yeah.
9080,Not all countries do vaccination cards though so it will be hard to enforce.
9081,My wife got vaccinated in Scotland and all she has is a print out from the gp.
9082,Everyone with a printer can make those.
9083,Seems to be the same in England with our government.
9084,I’m sorry your country is struggling right now.
9085,Depends what we define as normal.
9086,If we're talking just domestically then i think in the US/Uk and possibly the EU then summer.
9087,Might still be a mask mandate for some settings but generally I'd say it should be close to normal.
9088,In terms of international travel though that might be abit longer especially with what India is going through so might only be 2022 for international travel depending how winter plays out for the rest of the world.
9089,Although travel might be ok between select countries this year

9103,I'm so sick of people like you.

9115,"Never had covid and first shot of moderna was just a sore arm for a day, but the second shot hit me hard."
9116,"Full body aches, chills, fatigue."
9117,I am eagerly waiting to see some data on this.
9118,In the phase 1/2 trials it looked like the immune response to J&amp;J continued increasing up to day 50 or 60 but I have yet to see any data on if that translates to real-world effectiveness.
9119,Everyone who is vaccinated is safe.
9120,The statistics prove this overwhelmingly.
9121,"If someone has chosen to be unvaccinated, that's on them and the vaccinated are safe from them."
9122,We're also long past the point where deep cleaning is needed as fomites are not a transmission vector.
9123,Case precedent also prevents you from being sued by your employees.
9124,"As an employer, you need to do nothing more than you would if someone came to work with a cold and your response to the ill employee would, eventually and potentially, be the same response you'd take for someone who had cancer that took them out for a month."
9125,"If you'd fire them, you'd fire the COVID patient."
9126,"If you wouldn't, then you wouldn't."
9127,It's like some people think they've just abandoned 2nd doses when they haven't.
9128,It seems this month they've been giving out a huge number of 2nd doses.
9129,So they're definitely still doing 2nd doses just with a longer gap.
9130,Considering how bad the situation was for them in December/January can understand why.
9131,Arguably worked out very well for them
9132,"I believe it is the Indian variant with double mutation, which makes it much more contagious and allows for faster spreading."
9133,Time for more super-spread events.
9134,Problem with that approach is that they have already started inviting 58 and 59 year olds with Pfizer and by mid-May the 50+ will be largely invited for Pfizer.
9135,I think a combination of donating doses and giving second shots earlier than 12 weeks is the best option.
9136,"If the needle fear has anything to do with pain, try to get some lidocaine."
9137,Put it on maybe 20 minutes or so beforehand.
9138,It makes your skin numb.
9139,I’m not sure of the effectiveness of over-the-counter lidocaine.
9140,My experience is with prescription lidocaine.
9141,Maybe your doctor will prescribe some if it will help you get vaccinated.
9142,Get out and live life.
9143,People here on Reddit hate hearing the truth!
9144,"From my personal experience, yes, but I haven’t seen anything officially saying that."
9145,Same here!
9146,Got infected after my first dose and still haven’t got my second dose yet
9147,Don't know much about the Indian variant but is it a concern with vaccines?
9148,I think that argument sort of loses its punch once the vaccine supply is where it is today.
9149,"We have plenty of doses available for folks who are eligible, so even the most ""locked down"" getting a shot isn't going to deprive someone higher at risk."
9150,"And the reality is eventually, something likely will bring the most hermit like out of the basement."
9151,"A family member dying, an emergency that requires exposure of a higher risk."
9152,And even masked folks exposed long enough in a certain environment can catch it if they aren't vaccinated.
9153,They might already be at that level.
9154,Massive under reporting most likely going on due to lack of resources etc.
9155,If they have testing capacity they could definitely reach it
9156,"Give it about 20 hours, at least that what it took for me, but then the side effects were over in less than 24 hours."
9157,"To me the confusion isnt as much about thus second wave, but abour the first wave not really happening in the first place."
9158,It makes complete sense that India is hit hard.
9159,[removed]
9160,"For the first time in awhile, it’s easy to be excited about the future."
9161,"Maybe it’s the weather or maybe the vaccine, but things seem to be inching towards normal on a daily basis, which is excellent."
9162,"For complete normal my calculus is very few people wearing masks, scarce media coverage of covid, and little things like restaurants not sanitizing after every customer and stuff like that."
9163,"I agree that almost everything will be open once we hit that vaccine wall, but I think it’s going to take a year before people return to true pre-pandemic normal with smaller actions."
9164,I'm failing to understand why?
9165,Like i get the huge risk India poses to them but doesn't Australia have a pretty good quarantine system where everyone has to quarantine in a hotel for 14 days before being allowed to enter the country as normal?
9166,Surely that would be good enough to stop community transmission and the Indian variant from getting into Australia
9167,I guess you were wrong.
9168,Partially the vaccine developers and media are to blame for this.
9169,Especially in the media they reported 100% protection against hospitalization and death based on a pitiful amount of data.
9170,I was pretty bothered by the lack of nuance back then and you can see how it leads to shitty situations.
9171,That’s kinda what you would expect with millions getting vaccinated daily.
9172,The symptoms of the second shot are (usually) much more pronounced than the first.
9173,"With how many accounts you can see of awful second shot symptoms on social media, there might be people avoiding the second shot as a response to it."
9174,Because it's reddit and people are hating haters here.
9175,Tell Jio to roll out 4G properly first
9176,"Couple things, that 52% includes day 1 after receiving the vaccine."
9177,While the 80% from the CDC is only day 14 and after.
9178,These are not the same thing and they actually show what we expect.
9179,That it take 2 weeks to build up substantial protection.
9180,"Also as long as one dose provides more than half the protection as two doses, which every 14+ day one dose study shows, then two people receiving one dose provides better community protection than one person receiving two doses."
9181,They could possibly reduce the age requirement.
9182,Some countries I think have limited it to 50+ so they could potentially give it to those in their 50s as well.
9183,Otherwise probably best to just give it to other countries who need them.
9184,"Amazing how all comments that are right saying that the US help was austere, got the most negative karma."
9185,Even when the wealthy countries exploited so much from poor countries like India and so many others.
9186,This community is absolute garbage.
9187,I skipped the 2nd dose since I had covid
9188,That person was just ignorant then.
9189,"If everyone in India got infected, even if it was a 99% survival rate, it would still mean almost 14 **million** people dead."
9190,People over there still don't buy how bad it really was.
9191,Maybe they offer a 3-in-1 bundle
9192,Trump and Modi present challenges to the rules.
9193,How do you discuss a painting while being banned from bringing up the painter or the paint?
9194,&gt;Lockdown policies do harm to the overall population that objectively leads to deaths by them.
9195,"People staying in house, being affraid of going out, 

Pretty much a huge bunch of bullshit to suggest that lockdown policies kept people inside and not a personal risk calculation by individuals."
9196,"Sweden never locked down, but still had vastly reduced mobility and economic growth because most people didn't want to risk gulping for air like a fish out of water just so they could go out to eat."
9197,"The US basically had only voluntary lockdown in most states after about June, and restaurants, bars and gyms are open now - but they were vastly less used than before the pandemic again because we all know someone who died or is now a long hauler."
9198,"My kids school has been open since September, and only about 30% of kids go in person."
9199,"I like going out to eat, but it sure as hell isn't worth the risk until I'm vaccinated."
9200,Huh
9201,Is it even a worry of people not getting their 2nd dose?
9202,I mean if they've had their first dose then they're probably going to go back for a 2nd dose if they were willing to get vaccinated in the first place
9203,Vaccines work.
9204,Do wonders never cease?
9205,Get vaccinated America!
9206,In other news water is wet and the sun came up this morning.
9207,Classic that a CNN reader would view this as good news
9208,"To be clear, both parties can pass the virus."
9209,The higher transmission rate as well as the worse severity is on non-vaccinated parties.
9210,"Higher insurance rates (health insurance and 
short term disability) are only one factor."
9211,"You also have to look at sick leave usage for the employee (and immediate family), loss of productivity, environmental cleaning, and differences in safety regulations pertaining to two different standards between vaccinated vs unvaccinated."
9212,This all cost money for the company.
9213,The insurance cost is only one thing business owners like myself have to look at on our bottom line.
9214,"Secondly, it is not all about money."
9215,It is also about creating a safe environment for the employees.
9216,I live in one of these counties.
9217,"After everything opened up again, I re-joined my gym."
9218,Quickly noticed the number of people working out wearing face sheilds and no mask.
9219,"I asked for a refund, but not before learning this was acceptable by OSHA and the state."
9220,WTF?
9221,A disease passed by aerosols in a place where people are forcefully exhaling?
9222,What could go wrong?
9223,I am not suggesting this is the sole cause.....lots of science deniers where I live that haven't taken this seriously from day 1.
9224,But it sure as hell didn't help.
9225,"If the State is going to make rules based on science,  have consistency for heaven's sake."
9226,"And FYI, I work in an industry where we are very high risk (dentistry), and have made it through with no transmission to employees because we take the science seriously."
9227,"Difference between India and china is the ""great firewall of China""

Have a feeling China was / is just as bad"
9228,My guess is that you should be fine sir
9229,[removed]
9230,The vaccine rollout I.
9231,The us is a huge success  and probably the biggest in the world so far
9232,Not what the CDC recommends once you arrive to countries
9233,Damn no one is saying dont get a second shot.
9234,Just to hold off on it until most people who want a vaccine can get 1 shot.
9235,The UK and Canada are doing this and it seems they might be getting better bang for their buck than the US.
9236,"Well, indonesia still on First Waves"
9237,That spread doesn't really make a lot of sense.
9238,In 4-6 weeks we are going to hit an absolute wall with vaccinations.
9239,So either we do something to break through that wall or we just open everything up at that point.
9240,"Just ""waiting"" another 6-9 months is completely pointless and the worst possible option."
9241,"https://www.economist.com/graphic-detail/coronavirus-excess-deaths-tracker

A couple developed countries have higher reported covid-19 deaths than excess deaths."
9242,"This is what should be expected though, because flu deaths have been reduced to essentially zero, and COVID-19 took the lives of many who were likely to die of other causes not too long after."
9243,"The excess deaths clearly show that COVID-19 took the lives of far too many who weren't close to ""already being on their deathbed"", as some argue."
9244,[removed]
9245,[removed]
9246,"To be fair, about a year ago, nobody really knew what was going on."
9247,"March/April had a lot of unknowns, and that shit is actually frightening."
9248,"Even then, 500,000 people died because of this in the US alone, so like, some of that worry and panic was justified."
9249,How many people are skipping the second dose?
9250,?
9251,Not selfish at all on their part!
9252,That is great news
9253,"In the US at least: 

Kind of normal: Summer 

Completely 2019 Normal: Spring 2022"
9254,Probably the first three.
9255,"Shits starting to get back to normal in some places as cases plummet, which is neat."
9256,It legitimately seems like we’re on the other side of this thing.
9257,That is good news even though the population of India is immense
9258,I think you may be over estimating the number of people with permanent disabilities.
9259,Cite your numbers
9260,"Shocker, a nurse from Staten Island is an anti-vaxxer"
9261,Great news indeed .
9262,I can't wait to get my shot.
9263,This!
9264,Natural immunity is not talked about a lot because they don’t want people to go out and try to get that instead.
9265,Those are not the people that need convincing to get the vaccine.
9266,[deleted]
9267,Naa - modi fan agrees too this time.
9268,Vote him out in 2024
9269,Please stop lying.
9270,"https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/faq.html

&gt; The federal government is providing the vaccine free of charge to all people living in the United States, regardless of their immigration or health insurance status."
9271,Same thought I had when I read the article - why not just do a 30 or 60 day extension and then re-evaluate again then?
9272,The return to normal will be gradual.
9273,I think we will have a partial normal by the summer and mostly normal by the fall.
9274,"The fun thing about zoom calls is that the people you see on them actually exist in a room somewhere which, occasionally, has other people in it you can't see."
9275,"Yes, I know, it's wild - people you can't see exist."
9276,Peekaboo!
9277,So glad these life saving vaccines are taken off the shelf and being put into peoples arms in India and hopefully to our friends and neighbors to the north and south as well.
9278,Let's not do name calling now.
9279,If sensible people wanna change opinion on facts we shudnt shame them.
9280,I'm centre right but even i cant support this shit.
9281,Give me 1000 crore scams back.
9282,I'd take it over this.
9283,Total deaths since the beginning of covid (so late 2019) are definitely well in the 7 digit range then (and maybe even higher than the worldwide death toll)
9284,Yeah this was my experience as well.
9285,"Had COVID-19 in December, waited a little over 3 months to get the 1st shot and I felt it, but it wasn't terrible."
9286,The second shot was worse for me.
9287,Had two sinus infections since then I can't seem to kick which is not normal for me.
9288,Bodies are definitely weird.
9289,"You realize that this is the same argument as “I don’t care if the government is spying on its citizens, I have nothing to hide”?"
9290,Being a part of returning to normal life is enough incentive.
9291,If the last year has shown politicians everywhere don’t care about people.
9292,I think Serbia had the same issues where the numbers were low to push through an election and a week later it exploded.
9293,And in the US and UK you have the “but the economy!” idiots.
9294,the way to think about it is ***if you're exposed to covid*** (e.g.
9295,"you step into an elevator after someone suffering from covid was just in the same space), 95 times out of 100 you won't get it."
9296,"in practice, the number of times you're exposed to covid is /way/ lower, so that's why we're seeing numbers that resemble tiny fractions of a % vs vaccinated population, so while not 100% your chances of getting it definitely trends much closer towards 100% than 95%."
9297,There are a finite number of variants that can occur.
9298,We will have boosters to address variants.
9299,"Everyone, in the long run, will very likely have some form of immunity - natural, or via vaccination."
9300,This takes away the advantages a novel virus has in a naive population.
9301,No pandemic in history has ever lasted forever.
9302,Since I'm not obese I will not be getting the shot.
9303,I'd rather not have long term effects from an experiment
9304,Because someone got a stupid idea that vaccinated people are “shedding” spike proteins to non-vaccinated people.
9305,The issue with this idea is that those boomer age groups are the most politically active (especially in regards to turnout at elections) and typically will vote for conservative-leaning parties.
9306,Any party in power that is explicitly not a  left-leaning one would be crippling their own voter and funding base for years to come.
9307,"Papers please, comrade."
9308,... and all the huge gatherings they had without masks just a few weeks ago.
9309,[removed]
9310,Yes the death rate of an over 70 is 1000 times higher than a 30 years old but it doesn't discriminate by age.
9311,I personally had my second shot cancelled cause the pharmacy got the wrong shipment.
9312,I searched and searched for a replacement but they were always fully booked for the one i needed (Moderna).
9313,Now it’s been two months and I can’t find conclusive information on whether it’s too late or not :/

9320,"&gt;You didn't address my main point, which is that it wasn't lockdown policies that caused the economic slow down, it was a personal calculation of health risk by many individuals."
9321,Actually i did in my last paragraph.
9322,You probably decided to not read my message.
9323,Too large?
9324,Who knows?
9325,Companies and individuals staying afloat is important.
9326,Never claimed that there should be no response.
9327,"Also, ""lockdown"" doesnt even remotely mean the same thing everywhere and not every place is the same."
9328,"To copy+paste myself from a different response:

What would be actually interesting to me would be the local specifics which are incredibly hard to know for any given country if you're a foreigner."
9329,"They matter greatly and are often completely dismissed in favour of a idiotic (sorry, i feel that it is) pro or anti-lockdown blanket approach."
9330,In the case of my own country (Greece) we have so far 6 straight months of lockdown (!
9331,"), we cant go outside without sending an sms, arent allowed to move to the next municipality in a car and sometimes not even by foot, we have a curfew that sometimes starts at 18.00 but usually at 21.00, the majority of the economy is closed and here in Greece the economy is not highly industrialised so if you close the ""non-essential"" bits you close most of it, the police has been so authoritarian that there was a HUGE pro-democracy protest etc etc."
9332,"The situation in the hospitals has various details worth considering too for example: Gov decided to not hire the necessary ammount of nurses, decided to divert people from completely different medical specializations into covid units and ripped hundreds of private general doctors (when most vocal doctors were arguing that the gov should organize and strengthen first line healthcare in order for people to not end up in the hospitals) and put them in hospitals in completely irrelevant to what they know positions etc etc."
9333,"I mean i feel that way too many people will see all of this and think... ""Putin bad he didnt do enough lockdowns"" but i bet that it's infinetely more complicated than that and that there are differences of opinion on the best courses of action."
9334,Was there ever a question that he’s not responsible for this shit?
9335,i think i will need to buy more whiskey and scotch.
9336,*confirmed* cases
9337,"LoL yeah if we ignore the problem, it will go away"
9338,Start opening up while they’re still finding 25k people testing positive each day.
9339,Yeh.. this will go well 😑
9340,Ivermectin?
9341,They just dewormed themselves and called it a treatment for a respiratory virus?
9342,"Yeah I have been watching flight out of India, and it's fat too late."
9343,I'm thinking a booster (for those vaccinated).
9344,Will hopefully be in the works.
9345,The thing that sucks is that we screwed up the first time (outbreak in Wuhan) and the only thing we learned is that masks suck.
9346,"I think many people look at India as being ""over there"" while in reality it is over here."
9347,Fauci is fully vaccinated and yet is prancing around with two masks.
9348,"Also, viral transmission outside is minimal, why the fuck did the CDC recommend to wear a mask outside when you were alone?"
9349,"If the message was ""get the vaccine and things return to normal"" you would have more people willing to take it."
9350,Why would it make people dangerous?
9351,Just need a bite from some kind of radioactive vermin.
9352,Simple solution: give them $100 to go get vaccinated
9353,Do you have a link that says it is definitive?
9354,"I found this to put the risk/benefit into perspective:

&gt;A CDC official said that if J&amp;J’s vaccinations resumed, they could prevent as many as 1,400 deaths from Covid-19 and up to 3,500 intensive-care admissions over six months, while there could be up to 45 cases of the blood clotting condition."

9361,What incentive do you need other than getting it prevents you from ending up in the hospital and makes you less likely to spread it to others?
9362,"You can get vaccinated, protect yourself, and get us closer to herd immunity or you can be a dumbass that gets COVID because you didn't have enough ""incentive"" to get a free shot that keeps you out of the hospital."
9363,The governments act too slowly.
9364,The best time to close travel was exactly one month ago.
9365,I suppose stopping things now would still slow the spread.
9366,But the airways have been open for a month and multiple nations have recorded examples of the variants.
9367,The only way I have been able to is to just frigging do it.
9368,"If it's a vaccine, I do my wait and try to remind myself I have ever had a reaction, why would I now?"

9386,"His body, his choice."

9389,Variants can be contained the faster you act.
9390,I am actually wondering now how much of this is our of fear from hearing stories from others.

9397,Not a penny.
9398,Good day to you.
9399,Sending them to India to help them?
9400,It’s time for more proactive approaches.
9401,"Setting up at community events, outside stores, in communities, at churches, etc."
9402,it won’t be as efficient as the large-scale first wave but it’s what will be necessary to reach the “neutrals” who aren’t going to come to you.

9422,"I don't think you got my point at all, I'm sorry."
9423,"Yes, New York will have a larger population density than Toronto (note I said Greater Toronto Area, the population density of Toronto itself is 4334/sqkm, but that's beside the point)."
9424,"And yes, population density will absolutely have an impact on spread, but you can't look at population density of Canada as a whole and compare it to the USA as a whole and make any useful conclusions."
9425,Most of Canada is simply basically uninhabited.
9426,90% of its population lives within 160 km of the border with the US.
9427,What a shock... A lunkhead from Staten Island has vaccine hesitatiancy.
9428,Yeah my wife was freaking off it about it.
9429,I was like you want them to throw on some butterfly stitches so he looks disfigured because some nasty scaring and suffers the rest of his life ?
9430,Or do you want this to be the worst 15 minutes of his life ?
9431,She calmed down for the most part.
9432,I talked to a nurse about it she said it’s pretty normal unless there is damage to the bones.
9433,"She said the last thing we wanted was for our insurance to refuse to pay for a OR, Anesthesia, and hospital bed because of a few stitches."
9434,I think you are missing the point.
9435,"Everyone thinks the messaging is top-down, but it isn't."
9436,It's bottom up.
9437,"The politician isn't the source of the message, they are the result of it."
9438,"They have no control over it beyond those who gave them power

9445,What’s wild is that there are people who think the vaccines had nothing to do with it and cases are going down because we had a huge boost in mask and social distancing compliance a year into the pandemic.
9446,"You didn't address my main point, which is that it wasn't lockdown policies that caused the economic slow down, it was a personal calculation of health risk by many individuals."
9447,"Even if you want to point out the low death rate among the young here, in order to claim that everyone should have been out there bravely pretending life was normal, that doesn't make anyone want to risk it because the effects of the illness are quite severe even if you live."
9448,To late.
9449,Now everyone who wants to come will just rush before Tuesday.
9450,They prevented it before by having a lockdown so strict that you would be beaten up by a mob of police if you went outside.
9451,"I went from looking forward to vaccines becoming available, to something close to “wait and see”, to deciding I will most likely not get vaccinated."
9452,There’s a lot of reasons many people will not get the damn shot.
9453,Yes.
9454,It is very much a conspiracy but I kind of agree.
9455,"Mostly because this much death was great for the stock market, and the economy as a whole."
9456,"Not a doctor and a bona fide internet stranger with my advice: if op does not die from covid, get the second shot."
9457,Preliminary Studies show a booster delay is not a big problem.
9458,Also getting covid is like a booster in that it will provoke an immune response.
9459,But also check with your doctor.

9469,3.
9470,"If we do perceive we're about to have clotting complications, how should we respond in order to prevent more serious effects?"
9471,"True enough, I only say that because when I originally signed up for the first vaccine clinic they had to reschedule everyone to the first half of the day because they couldn't get enough people to sign up."
9472,Also my second shot was auto scheduled and had to be canceled and they found another shot clinic for me to go to bc the doses were withheld by the county due to such low numbers of people signing up.

9507,This was bound to be a bridge we would have to cross.
9508,A significant number of Americans are Trump heads who laughed and downplayed the pandemic and view it as fear mongering and “muh freedoms.”  Rural regions seem to shrug off the vaccine and don’t bother.
9509,"There are people who are anti-vaxx, which seem to be growing at an alarming rate on social media (look at measles making a comeback)."
9510,"The wait and see folk, including nurses, seem to want to wait years for FDA approval or are freaked out by blood clots."

9548,A recent school study in Omaha showed consistent levels of COVID present in the air and sewage and infection rates six times higher than reported among students.

9614,4 million Americans vaccinated per day in July?
9615,Yeah that’s not happening.
9616,"It's not a hurrah that now younger people are getting super ill also, it's that presumably the older population has received their full vaccination and they are no longer succumbing to the worst of covid to the point of hospitalization."
9617,"The hope, of course, is that as every age group becomes fully vaccinated that severe hospitalizations will drop to nil."
9618,It's the same here in the UK.
9619,"Even the BBC got in on the action with this lying bullshit, which is supposed to be a responsible news source."
9620,These stories have been around since the beginning of the pandemic and it's 100% a coordinated attempt to scaremonger young people into sacrificing years of their life for a virus that posed little threat to them.
9621,"I swear some people want restrictions forever, this is great news"
9622,Thank you.
9623,"I know, that's why I asked for an example of another, because I didn't think there was one."

&gt;I guarantee it's not just FDA approved ones

9628,Those are all things that the trump admin said
9629,The chance of survival of someone young is much higher.
9630,"The real reason for celebration is that vaccines work and a higher proportion of the older population have received theirs, hence the drop is hospitalisation rates."
9631,"You’ll find that overall hospitalisation rates are dropping, not that rates in younger people are increasing."
9632,What kind of variant currently spread in Michigan and other States?
9633,B.1.1.7 or other Variant?
9634,I would also be curious to know what % of the people under 40 being hospitalized have other issues that make them more susceptible.
9635,"Pre-existing health issues, obesity, etc."
9636,"Not judging anyone, just wondering how many of the under-40's being hospitalized are healthy and physically fit people."
9637,I'm guessing it's a very tiny number.
9638,Exactly.
9639,"That's why some countries favor older people or those with comorbidities, they know that younger folks will get infected and develop natural immunity without causing too much load on the health system."
9640,"On the long run though, they'll have to try to vaccinate these as well to limit the impact of future variants and to slow down the spread of the disease in their societies."
9641,I don’t think anyone saved by it is going to mind.
9642,"The good news for me would be that everything is under control, the pandemic is over and masks and no longer needed."
9643,Is it obesity?
9644,I'm kind of confused by the word you created.
9645,I'll admit you have a point on that
9646,The needle stick takes like one second.
9647,Just look away during the process and relax your arm.
9648,I had a mild fever the night of but I just went to sleep and it was gone the next morning.
9649,It means the vaccines are working on older people who received them first.
9650,"They DID go the mRNA route, it has been in development for a while now, and if everything goes well it is set to release by Q3-4 this year."
9651,"It is called ARCoV vaccine, made by Walvax Biotechnology, Suzhou Abogen Biosciences, and PLA Academy of Military Science."
9652,"They started building manufactutring facility (120mil dose) back in December

9653,"&gt; From the article: “We're now seeing people in their 30s, 40s and 50s — young people who are really sick.”

There's literally been a quote like that every month/week since the start of the pandemic."
9654,Can't blame anyone for believing it at first but there's something wrong with you if you still can't see through it by now.
9655,It's absolutely a strategy to scare/mislead young people into complying with restrictions despite the risk to them being minimal.
9656,If that fear gets young people off their asses and vaccinated it might be worth it this time.
9657,"It's strong evidence that the vaccine works, and that it's worth it for young people to get it."
9658,Exactly.
9659,This has nothing to do with your chances of ending up hospitalized when your under 40.
9660,That is the truth.
9661,I guess people don't want to consider that side of it.
9662,"Of course, we could also deduce that vaccines are working for older folks in Michigan."
9663,That is the truth also.
9664,It's just that only one or the other truth is acceptable to say out loud depending on your audience.
9665,Silly.
9666,Was watching my weekly covid CE this past week.
9667,They were talking about how they kept seeing a lot of college students skipping dose 2.

9679,They also don't want to vaccinate them all at once.
9680,I think the Blue Jays had a few players miss games because of vaccine related side affects.
9681,They’re tired of staying in during the best years of their lives.
9682,They stayed locked down for a year so they could save grandma’s life and now that grandma is vaccinated they don’t give a fuck anymore and I can’t say I blame them.
9683,"Really wish they’d get vaccinated, though!"
9684,"If this is such a big problem, maybe more vaccine providers should let you sign up for a second dose even if you didn't get your first with them?"
9685,I moved and it's been a huge hassle.

9959,Watching Reddit turn on Joe Rogan and Elon Musk this past year just because they are not Corona panic boys has been hilarious to watch.
9960,It is not at all clear whether more years of life will be lost by younger people who have more time ahead dealing with the long term consequences of Covid hospitalization than by older people.
9961,Having to go through hospitalization is bad news also for younger ones.
9962,A middle aged person suddenly with heart and lung damage may loose decades of life expectancy.
9963,It will be 100% normal other than Broadway probably not having started yet.

9965,Everything must be about America and Trump.
9966,The world revolves around America.
9967,Let’s also not forget: America bad.
9968,Joe Rogan has left the chat.
9969,What are you talking about?
9970,Biden did a lot in his 100 days
9971,Which begs the question: why are so many younger people choosing not to get vaccinated?
9972,In addition to engaging in risky behaviors when unvaccinated.
9973,I see so many younger people talking about how they aren’t at risk d/t not dying at a high rate.
9974,That’s like not wearing a seat belt because you aren’t likely to die in most accidents.
9975,"But even belted, and with air bags, you can still get one hell of a life changing concussion."
9976,Might as well just go to 100 once you're getting above 50

9978,Ugh.
9979,Ok doc
9980,"The psychology behind this, is it fear based and in turn validating their hesitancy to believe in the most ridiculous, excuse grasping theories?"

I went to plenty of large sporting events in the US last year before vaccines were ever a thing, and never caught covid."
9982,"The largest event I went to last August had around 30,000 people in attendance, and to date I have never been able to find a single article linking it to any super spreader style outcomes."
9983,"Encouraging people to get a vaccine to do things that they've already been able to do, and in my case have actually done safely the entire last year is a failing proposition."
9984,We saw the same thing in Israel.
9985,Young people got vaccinated less so some of them found themselves in the hospital.
9986,"Send me a scientific article, not government propaganda please!"
9987,If you read the article you’ll note that it is also an absolute increase for young people
9988,If you’re taking any medical advice from a celebrity (pro or anti-vax) you are stupid.

9993,Israel also has the best vaccination percentage in the whole world (save for maybe some small remote island countries).
9994,They shouldn't see a massive increase.
9995,"If they do and it's followed by overwhelmed hospitals, then we should all be extremely worried."
9996,There’s nothing misrepresentative about stating facts.

10009,"In Montreal, Canada"
10010,That's not why more people under 40 are being hospitalized over people over 80.
10011,That strain would be effecting people over 80 in far worse numbers if it weren't for the fact that those over 80 are far and above already vaccinated.
10012,Younger people aren't getting hospitalized at dramatically higher absolute numbers now than before.
10013,"It's just that those who used to make up most of the hospitalizations are no longer being hospitalized because of the vaccination defense so what's left are those younger people, who up until only recently, could not be vaccinated."
10014,This is a good this.
10015,Very good thing.
10016,I still think we’ll get a lot of people who are either apathetic or on the fence in July and August and we’ll have a long tail of people getting the vaccine in those months as well as kids as the fda approves.

10026,"I mean honestly, how many over 80 are left?"

10138,Sure it is.
10139,But the absolute increase in rates for young people is also worrisome: it’s another indication that the variant is getting really out of control in Michigan and that the risk levels for unvaccinated folks there really are a lot higher

10393,We accept the risk.
10394,"In my anecdotal experience with several hundred covid patients, obese patients get it the worst."
10395,"This correlates with a lot of other problems like hypertension and diabetes, but it’s really the obesity in general."

10415,You're disgusting.
10416,You're doing it again.
10417,Statistics are great for understanding trends in a population.
10418,"They're great for forming policy that address entire states, countries, etc."
10419,Statistics aren't really helpful when assessing personal risk.
10420,"When you apply statistics to an individual things break down, because there are an immesurably large number of nuances, external factors, biases, micro-climates of like or unalike people, that make the statistics pretty much useless."
10421,"Unless you have statistics that examine a sufficiently large population of people who are not only exactly like you but also are surrounded by people exactly like the ones you're surrounded by, you're not actually getting any helpful information from that data."
10422,You can't apply trends on a macro demographic scale to an individual.
10423,"That's not what they're for, especially when the extremes are so, well, extreme."
10424,"You're right that in general, the average young person is pretty safe from covid, but unless you know how close to the average you are, and you're OK with the consequences being long term health issues or death, it's a pretty useless piece of information."
10425,"&gt;Simultaneously, I could also be vaccinated and end up getting covid without knowing and infecting any number of people."
10426,And you know what the difference is?
10427,"A vaccinated person has taken the necessary precautions, and has done their part to reduce their risk of transmitting the virus as much as possible (something that you refuse to do)."
10428,The unvaccinated person is defying public health recommendations and putting others at *unnecessary risk.
10429,"* We can't prevent it 100% but we CAN take precautions, and the vaccine is the most important precaution."
10430,You are putting others at extra risk than necessary by not getting the vaccine.

10436,Both of those numbers are severely under-reported and undercounted.
10437,"Their positivity rates have been ranging from mid-teens to the 30s in many large cities, so it's likely that those confirmed numbers are just a fraction of the actual toll."
10438,"With the weak public health infrastructure in India, it's probably impossible to capture all or most of the cases and deaths."
10439,We'll probably need to wait for some seroprevalence studies done by independent organizations to determine the full toll India are facing.
10440,[removed]
10441,This.
10442,I’ve had both of my shots and am grateful for it.
10443,It doesn’t change the fact that I almost worked myself into a panic attack on the drive home even knowing that the chance of serious side effects are astronomically low.

10453,Not counting the eggs before they hatch but I'm feelin real good about a mostly normal summer!
10454,I know they may adjust for things earlier.
10455,"However, I cannot shake the feeling that at this point in time, that the last people we need to get off the fence of hesitancy (people who wont get the vaccine because they believe restrictions wont ever go away) need an additional carrot?"
10456,"Why are they not at this point telling these people “hey, get your vaccine and tell your friends when we get to a certain benchmark, no more masks if you want!”"

OTOH, they might be in a higher-risk group b/c they ARE in a gym?"

10507,"A, an unvaccinated individual who religiously wears masks, and consents to asymtomatic bi-weekly PCR testing."
10508,"B, a vaccinated individual who per CDC guidance no longer needs to wear a mask while outdoors, and whom never completes any COVID testing."

10615,I still wear it everywhere it's mandated of course.
10616,"""Admissions"" means they were *admitted*."
10617,"In practical terms, what that means is that they showed up to the ER, saw a doctor, that doctor thought their condition was serious enough to require hospitalization, and another doctor saw their file and agreed to admit them."

10632,"Simultaneously, it is very possible that a vaccinated individual could asymptomatically transmit the virus to others."
10633,"Either way, asymptomatic transmission is a reality."
10634,"The difference with me however, is that being unvaccinated I regularly test for covid and can almost definitively say that I have not transmitted anything to anybody as I have not had the virus in my body in detectable levels sufficient to be able to transmit it to others."
10635,"If I was vaccinated, I wouldn't complete any covid tests as with my employer vaccinated individuals cannot even get a covid test, and subsequently I would have no idea if I was asymptomatically transmitting anything."
10636,Sounds like you will only have two left when this is over.
10637,It's possible and you're right there's nothing stopping it exactly.
10638,Also it's a fair point that lockdown might change the pressures a bit.

10669,This is true.
10670,"A huge factor is what the lockdown is used FOR; it's a stopgap that starves out the virus a bit (staving off the spread a bit) and buys time that can be used to improve healthcare capacity and testing/tracing/quarantining systems -- and, now, to get vaccinations underway."
10671,"The Philippines didn't really do any of that, and started opening places up more and more over time."
10672,"As such, when the more infectious variants began popping up, the spikes were inevitable."

10713,"Oh right, sending a pittance when it's too late will justify the initial hoarding of the overwhelming majority of supply."
10714,"Fauci and all the experts warning against hoarding early in the vaccine rollout must be shouting nonsense, huh."
10715,And sending me the vaccine supply?
10716,I'm in the US; try being less presumptive.
10717,"Also, it's just astounding to me that a matter of public and global health importance can sound ""political"" to anyone."
10718,"All this might be true, but what it comes down to in my opinion is that each vaccine has a regimen that is being tested and studied long-term."
10719,"Anything else is in the category of ""it might work, but we don't know because we're only able to run one big trial here."""
10720,"One shot might be enough, and we might find that out later, but we might also find out that one shot leaves you relatively unprotected after 2 months, the studies just can't be done right now."

10779,I've worked the entirety of the pandemic as a healthcare provider with COVID postive patients in a critical care setting.
10780,For up to 12 hours a day during the heat of the pandemic I was breathed and coughed on by COVID patients while amongst other things standing within arms reach of them while they were administered nebulizer treatments.
10781,"I never once tested positive for covid, and 7 months into the pandemic had no detectable antibodies either."
10782,"How have I never tested positive for covid, and how have I been asymptomatic to all high-level covid symptoms thus far?"

10785,When you get into the ICU having a BMI of 23 may be optimal but looking at the graphs in general the Covid death risk is lowest at BMI of 26 and really raising around 30.

10816,It would be a much better thing if young people could just socially distance for just a few more weeks and get vaccinated rather than ending up in the hospital.
10817,There's still a lot of research to be done on long term effects of COVID.
10818,"Saying weve ""never"" had a disease like this is abit extreme, I think its more like this, we've never seen a disease this deadly that spread so fast in the information age, the last one comparable, Spanish flu, happened over 100 years ago..even so our knowledge of how the immune system fights pathogens is still evolving, it's very likely the world has seen bad coronaviruses in the past, the fact that camels and llamas apparently have total immunity points to a nasty coronavirus somewhere in our earths past"

10822,There’s nothing disingenuous about telling young people they are more likely to get hospitalized than old people when the data is telling you exactly that.
10823,You may be smart and not need manipulating.
10824,Cool.
10825,It’s beyond obvious a huge portion of the country is not and I’m very glad there are big corporations fighting on the right side of history for a change.
10826,Many people have died needlessly.
10827,It's a dumb policy that I don't support.
10828,It still isn't hoarding.
10829,Other countries are not owed vaccines we made for ourselves.
10830,"Hoarding would be if the AstraZeneca vaccines had been ordered by a foreign government, and we refused to deliver them once they were made."
10831,That's not what is happening here.
10832,"I think once we get the okay for kids to get vaccinated, you'll definitely see this in full."
10833,I know some parents who are fully vaccinated that are still hesitant because they have kids with various comorbidities who can't get vaccinated yet.
10834,It doesn't help walking it back to reality deniers.
10835,That poison is already out there...Tr=%mp already convinced millions of people it isn't even real.
10836,It's too late to walk anything back once it's out.
10837,You have the right take but it's going over everyone's head.
10838,"Hospitalizations aren't ever good, regardless of age."
10839,This means symptoms are bad.
10840,I would agree that it's better to have young people with a higher percentage of case count though.
10841,Controversial claim: This is just so that the rich and powerful can boast about getting vaccinated without being shamed for skipping the lines.
10842,"There are very few vaccines available and rather than drop the age incrementally, they just made it free for all."
10843,I'm supportive of 2 shots.
10844,"But I don't understand why the guidance for the 2 shot regimen that has you likely immune above 50% the entire time still suggests you should stay isolated for 6 weeks, while the J&amp;J is 50% pretty much flat out and 2 weeks to get to that level of immunity is enough."
10845,It's dumb.
10846,"&gt; The biggest reason for the demographic shift, experts say: The difference in vaccination rates."
10847,In other words the news article isn't news at all.
10848,It's just an update that the vaccines work as intended.
10849,Insert the Daily Struggle meme (the two buttons one) here.
10850,So what you're saying is you believe that Urban Youth™ are too Lazy to get vaccinated?
10851,It hasn't maybe occurred to you that there may be some sort of medical history and systemic problems for that particular population that might make them hesitant to sign up for a new vaccine?
10852,Yeah that part blows
10853,"Ok, so feeling a little under the weather for a few days is scaring people away from being fully vaccinated from a very debilitating and deadly virus?"
10854,I just don’t get the country logic of people doing this.
10855,[removed]
10856,I'm sorry.
10857,I have five yr old twins too but no health issues.
10858,This year has been hard on me but I can't imagine being in your shoes!
10859,Hang in there.
10860,A stronger immune system doesn't lessen the chances of getting COVID-19.
10861,"It's a **novel** coronavirus which means there are no antibodies against it, regardless of how healthy someone is."
10862,Unleash the panic!
10863,"Even beyond covid, needles can be a huge trigger for a lot of people, and even if they logically know it's not a big deal and power through, that anxiety can catch up after the poke anyway."
10864,&gt; It needs to be more common knowledge that this virus isn't some normal run of the mill shit.
10865,"The virus that was named for god damned *2019* has killed however god damned many *hundreds of thousands* of people in this *wholly* god damned country alone and we're four god damned months into 2021 and if someone won't accept the god damned severity of this situation then they never god damned will

God fucking damnit"
10866,Bottom line though is this virus 🦠 needs to be eradicated before it gets even worse.
10867,If that asshole Trump would be adamant about getting it and even giving a speech to it's benefits we may be able to reach herd immunity.
10868,Some are so hard headed they won't even listen to him but some will.
10869,However I don't think he ever will because all he cares about is himself.
10870,The only reason we know he and his family are vaccinated is because it leaked.
10871,"Sad that that's what it took, and even though the cat is out of the bag nobody with the last name of Trump save his niece will come out and speak truth to it."

10881,Don't worry about the mutations.
10882,This is one of those things that is technically possible and something that experts need to worry about but won't be the worst case scenario unless we're in a meltdown.
10883,As our cases are generally falling that becomes less of a concern.
10884,"Add natural immunity to whatever the vaccinated number is (which despite demand falling, is still slowly adding people) and we will still reach herd immunity at some point this summer."
10885,It'll be better when kids are allowed to vaccinate.
10886,"Also, we've done terribly at truly estimating herd immunity."
10887,India thought they had it so relying on just herd immunity is the wrong approach but we can assume some sort of base level in the US because of our terrible waves.
10888,"I gather he's the same person, you just put too much stock on a normal person."
10889,Who’s doing this?
10890,What’s the thought process?
10891,That was due to very specific selective pressure.
10892,Most of the global spread of the Spanish flu was die to soldiers fighting in WW1.
10893,"Those who had milder versions of the flu recovered near where they were stationed, whole those with severe versions were often sent home, allowing those variants to spread much more widely."
10894,"So, you're absolutely right that its possible, bit it's not the normal evolution of a virus."
10895,Oh for sure
10896,Nearly all the other young people at my job refused free vaccines.
10897,Ymmv
10898,"There aren’t enough vaccinated yet , especially both doses, and we’ll see exponential growth, likely mutations ,  and way more deaths."
10899,Unless you don’t believe the scientific modelling.

10918,It seems to be all about themselves - no consideration that they may pass it on to someone who is more at risk than they think they are.
10919,I have a coworker in the above demographic who won’t get a vaccine because he’s young and thinks he won’t get very sick.
10920,"The fact is that he has at least one risk factor (quite overweight) and is a functional alcoholic, which I doubt helps anything either."

10934,About a quarter of vaccineless people in my state haven't gotten their first shot because they can't take the time off since they're essential.
10935,"The rest are what's going to keep us from 'herd immunity' as yet again redefined here (down to 70% from 90, then 85%), since basically everyone that plans to get one has already gotten their first dose."
10936,Seriously.
10937,Ours (the orange monster as I call him) was so incredibly heartless and vile for 4 years.
10938,"It’s one thing not enough people talk about; they just laugh at his stupidity, but don’t talk about how evil he was."
10939,This guy comes off like a scam artist media whore
10940,This pandemic has been so dictated by people who do the wrong thing and it’s frustrating.
10941,“Stay home as cases rise because people wanna party and not wear masks” and now that people are doing the right thing and getting vaccinated it’s “keep masking up and socially distancing even though you’re vaccinated because we need to convince more people to get it” I hope eventually those of us who have done the right thing and cared for those around us get rewarded for our sacrifices because it feels completely the opposite at times

10960,First dose was just arm soreness as if I worked out really hard.
10961,Ya me too.
10962,Covid-19 is still mysterious and continuing to evolve though people who are young and don't know they have it so Covid is like ok I got something for ya then you also have a huge denier problem here in the states to where we may never reach herd immunity.
10963,"They won't care and some won't think it's real, others won't take it seriously until it effects someone close to them."
10964,Even then it's a toss up because I met a guy at work who's father died from Covid and he STILL won't get vaccinated and talks shit on masks.

10988,"When 100,000,000 people have safely gotten the shots, what new evidence possibly made you go from eager to get it to deciding not to?"
10989,&gt;It is not at all clear whether more years of life will be lost by younger people who have more time ahead dealing with the long term consequences of Covid hospitalization than by older people.
10990,Anyone that doesn't want to get vaccinated because we don't know the long term consequences should also know that we don't understand the full long term consequences of Covid.
10991,This is not correct.
10992,"There are some variants, as you would expect from a Coronavirus."
10993,Some may be more contagious.
10994,The vaccines still work against all variants.
10995,The reason more young people are getting sick is because they are not vaccinated and they are not quarantining.
10996,"Vaccines don't stop totally transmission in the same sense that condoms don't totally prevent pregnancy: they typically do, in the vast majority of cases, but it's not 100%, so in some cases people should take additional precautions based on their risk factors."
10997,"We know sometimes people get breakthrough infections even after vaccination, and we expect them to be at least somewhat infectious."
10998,The message around levels of safety will change as more people get vaccinated.
10999,A fully vaccinated person in Israel is a lot safer than a fully vaccinated person in India.

11022,Hello everyone!
11023,There is a shortage of Oxygen Flow Meters with Humidifier in Central Oxygen Line in a public sector hospital in India.
11024,"The model number of the Oxygen Flow Meter with humidifier bottles is VSAFMD 203, on the following website,

[http://sareensurgicals.com/flow-meter.html](http://sareensurgicals.com/flow-meter.html)

We are looking for leads/sources on this model or on similar makes."
11025,"Any help, suggestions or information would be awesome and appreciated."
11026,"Sorry folks, I'm trying to spread the word."
11027,"If this isn't the place for it, apologies."
11028,Work From UK.
11029,That's it.
11030,"No I’m not trolling, it was a random comment on the article and then you responded."
11031,"Even with a good percent of Canadians vaccinated, trudeau will still keep the country shutdown through next year."
11032,"The vulnerable are vaccinated, the deaths are down, hospitals are not overwhelmed, and yet, here we are."
11033,"And yes, I realize there was a small uptick in deaths in april."
11034,"However, more people are dying from opioids in Canada than Covid."
11035,"Wait, I thought if I was young, healthy, worked out, and ate well, that I really didn't need to worry about this kind of thing?"

11038,"The Spanish flu mutation was way way way more deadly than it was when it first got around, a virus absolutely can become more deadly"
11039,I know what you mean.
11040,I agree.
11041,[removed]
11042,I just find “too hard” to be kind of ridiculous.
11043,"National databases exist that show exactly who has had what and when in addition to who has had the vaccine, it’s not just your little card."
11044,This is not available to the general public but you can bet your butt it is available to the govt and any authority that needs access.
11045,A simple estimate should be trivial and I find misleading the public about where we are at a little worrying.
11046,"Meh covid is basically the flu, amirite?"
11047,It is quite clearly by the younger folks.
11048,"There's a thread on this on Twitter that I'll try to link to if I can find it, but there are two factors at work: the young have many more years left, #1, but also they have a very low percentage chance of dying normally."
11049,So covid is making the % above expected deaths for middle aged folks skyrocket.
11050,"Current pressures may cause the virus to spread more when presymptomatic, sure, but the argument before was that it was more lethal, which isn't necessarily true."
11051,Helps that there are a lot more 40 year olds than 80 year olds...

11068,Not requiring the vaccine just gives another excuse to anti-vaxxers
11069,Because you are assuming the nurse is not asymptotic.
11070,The reason people are encouraged to wear masks is because around 25% of covid cases are asymptotic.
11071,"If you don’t have any symptoms, you can go out in public and wear a mask in case you’re asymptotic."
11072,"If you’re symptomatic, you shouldn’t be in public at all."
11073,PPE is different and includes more things than just a mask.
11074,"Face shields, double mask, goggles, gloves, etc."
11075,"If you come in contact with someone who has covid, simply wearing a mask isn’t going to drastically reduce your chances of catching it."
11076,"“After 1 month, 42 people out of 2,392 in the group that wore masks, or 1.8%, developed a COVID-19 infection, compared to 53 people out of 2,470 in the group that didn’t wear masks, or 2.1%.”

https://www.webmd.com/lung/news/20201119/how-much-does-wearing-a-mask-protect-you

So it’s about a 16% reduction in infections in people who said they wore their masks."
11077,"Now, would your chances be lower if you wore two masks, had gloves, goggles, a face shield, etc?"
11078,Of course.
11079,But no ones going to wear that in public nor is it what OP was implying.
11080,"true, better to train at home"
11081,"&gt;less older people

Fewer"
11082,Right?
11083,I swear the first thing of his I heard which really made me love him was this microbiologist he was talking to.
11084,That's actually what got me into microbiology cause I'm pretty sure that's where I heard of tardigrades.
11085,Now its...its...its just BANJO INTENSIFIES
11086,That was a really cool article.
11087,Very uplifting!
11088,It made me very happy to see my country helping out neighbors and gladly sharing vaccines!
11089,"So many Canadians live near the border, so if they can get a shot here then that's great."
11090,"The more Canadians that get vaccinated, the better for all of us."
11091,Hopefully the border crossing restrictions end soon.
11092,"Lots of Canadians and Americans have friends and family on either side of the border, and the last year has been really tough for those folks."
11093,Share the vaccines and open that border up!
11094,Ding ding ding!
11095,Winner!
11096,Gagnon!
11097,"If there was a vaccine you could get which made it so you couldn't get in a car accident, would you get it?"
11098,I know I would.
11099,Imagine if car accidents were contagious.
11100,You go to a restaurant one evening and that night another diner gets in a car crash on the way home.
11101,"And because you were at the same restaurant, you get in a car crash 2 weeks later."
11102,And then your friends and family all get in car accidents over the following weeks.
11103,"Luckily nobody in your family dies, but a couple of your extended family lose a limb, and one ends up with life long seizures as a result of a head injury in their crash."
11104,"But nobody died right, so it's fine that some of your family have life long injuries which affect their daily lives as long as they didn't die?"
11105,Because getting a vaccine just isn't worth the trouble and risk as very few are going to actually die as a result of the car crashes.
11106,"And as long as only a few of your friends and family only suffer life long injuries and don't actually lose their life, it's all good right?"
11107,It's not like ongoing quality of life is important.
11108,And crippling ongoing medical expenses isn't a problem when you have universal health care.
11109,"Oh wait, ignore that last one, because it's less of a problem than the terrible burden of taking an hour out of your day on two occasions to get a vaccine."
11110,That's just asking too much.
11111,"&gt;	I'm bulletproof, nothing to lose

&gt;	Fire away, fire away

&gt;	Ricochet, you take your aim

&gt;Fire away, fire away

&gt;You shoot me down, but I won't fall

&gt;I am titanium

&gt;	You shoot me down, but I won't fall

&gt;	I am titanium"
11112,"Wow, that long?"
11113,You must be based in Canada or the UK.
11114,"I think you'll be fairly strongly protected in the interim period, but still remain cautious, certainly more than when you're fully vaccinated."
11115,But I do hope that health authorities can put out guidelines for how to proceed if you're in between doses fairly soon.
11116,This was Ontario 2 weeks ago.
11117,"Just the age group part.... we're still being gaslighted, manipulated and fucked by half measures."
11118,I mean I haven't read it but knowing the NYT it almost certainly is at least *trying* to monger fear.
11119,"No, it has to do with the types of people he has on."
11120,"He used to have tons of experts in their fields on, professors, etc."
11121,he’s switched that lately (over the last year) to be more just entertainment guests and stuff and IMO the show has really gone way down hill for it.
11122,At what point are scientists going to stop calling the virus Covid-19?
11123,It's now 2021 and there at least 12 different worldwide strains of it.
11124,"[Safety and Efficacy of the BNT162b2 mRNA Covid-19 Vaccine | NEJM](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2034577)

Congrats on your shot, you have excellent protection starting 10-14 days after your first shot."
11125,You're in the final stretch!
11126,First dose has like a 90% efficacy rate after two weeks.
11127,You in the UK or Canada I'm assuming?
11128,I am one of them...
11129,I still need my 2nd one some day....
11130,Because young people aren’t dying nearly as much.
11131,Difference is he used to just riff about shit that didn't matter and bullshit with guests about their lives.
11132,It didn't matter if the shit he was saying was stupid because he was talking about playing Quake for 80 hours a week or about how gorillas take shits the size of Pringles cans.
11133,Now all he does is rattle off about political shit he doesn't know anything about.
11134,[removed]
11135,As an anxiety sufferer I am not surprised.
11136,I used to faint with the finger prick trying to give blood.
11137,"I would get faint with every vaccine, flu shot, and blood draw."
11138,It wasn't until I had to have weekly blood draws for a medical issue a year and a half ago that I could finally get over the sensation...
11139,But yeah any medical procedure I'm not used to causes a vasovagal response.
11140,"For me I think it's a combo of people under 40 being apprehensive, while also the vaccine being jabbed into more arms of older people from the start."
11141,"Also, fun fact, people under 40 work with the public much more, and as these states open and more contact occurs it's bound to happen."
11142,I'm waiting for the 'quite vaping' equivalent of a phizer commercial but we'll wait and see.
11143,"I got my shots, worse thing was drowsyness and aches for a day, but you'd be surprised how many don't want it after hearing the word side effect."
11144,"The ridiculously slow, over cautious, and confusing guidance from the CDC has *not* helped the situation."
11145,The amount of people I have heard and/or read saying “Than what’s the point of getting it?” - and they have a point.
11146,A reporter even asked about this during the White House cdc briefing - and how Biden is still insisting on double masking indoors with one other fully vaccinated person.
11147,They never answered the question.
11148,"CNN Cuomo asked the CDC spokesman over 4 times on his show recently, and the question was dodged every time."

11180,They haven't been allowed to until very recently.
11181,That same kinda crap was stated last year at this time.
11182,I mean regardless of age obesity is a huge factor in covid.
11183,"Like a third of younger adults are obese, with another twenty percent  being overweight."
11184,My issue with the media is that they don't acknowledge this either.
11185,"There were several articles of someone in their twenties with ""no prexisting conditions"" who died from covid."
11186,When they show the picture the person is obviously obese.
11187,73 percent of Americans are overweight or obese.
11188,They deserve to know how much of a risk it is.
11189,Lol these are technicalities.
11190,I am talking from ideological point of view.
11191,It either is a good idea and should apply in virtual reality as well or is not a good idea and should not apply anywhere.
11192,The Joe Rogans and the essential oil yogis...A lot of my friends in the yoga world are noticing the vaccine hesitancy all due to fertility reasons...eye roll.
11193,Modi is much worse.
11194,It's because Boomers like my parents who peddle Facebook conspiracies still got vaccinated since they don't even believe that shit.
11195,Jesus christ
11196,I thought so.
11197,So OP should delay their second dose until they are no longer infected?
11198,Not supposed to go at all if you have an active covid infection.
11199,"Sadly, yes."
11200,"Well, that's OK then."
11201,Endangering public safety and destabilizing our democracy?
11202,"Sure, but at least it's *funny*."
11203,https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/covid-19/health-departments/breakthrough-cases.html - divide the number of breakthrough cases by the number fully vaccinated.
11204,For me it's kind of the opposite... sort of.
11205,"I'm vaccinated, and I've been trying to live as normal as possible with my vaccinated friends, but what I'm afraid of isn't the virus itself, but the restrictions."
11206,no.
11207,do not show up with covid to a vaccination center.
11208,PLEASE
11209,"He creepin

P.s."
11210,I love Gabon :)
11211,That makes sense given that older people have had more opportunity to get vaccinated by now.
11212,The takeaway here is “get your shot.”
11213,"I thought that only happened when you got the J&amp;J, Pfizer, Moderna, and AZ fearsome foursome combo deal"
11214,Who knew uneducated and overconfident people saying seemingly catchy things could be wrong?
11215,Might be true but the new variants are more lethal to the youth than the original covid

11224,Could go the way of the flu and be a but more dangerous but not as bad as it is now.
11225,Also the rate of spread will go down.

11315,*
11316,Got my 2nd vaccine yesterday.
11317,Feel like I have a hangover.
11318,Great questions!
11319,1.
11320,"I have a BS in engineering, and work in research and development."
11321,My job is to review literature and apply techniques to solving new problems.
11322,"I am scientifically literate with a strong background in applied statistics and data ananlysis

2."
11323,I have been unable to find the raw data relating to the safety and efficacy of the vaccines which is the biggest concern I currently have.
11324,"FDA will publish their findings once full approval of the vaccines is completed

3."
11325,"I haven't found any long term effects possible after injection, as the vaccines have simply not been out long enough for those data to exist."
11326,Lack of data is not a sufficient basis to make any conclusions of long-term safety/efficacy.
11327,4.
11328,2 years is a number I feel confident in as that's roughly twice the length of time the vaccines have existed to this point.
11329,"Furthermore, it's liely that the FDA will have either given extended EUA, or revoked the EUA at that point."
11330,Well I never expected to see a Survivor reference in this subreddit lmfao
11331,&gt; California did well no matter how you look at it.
11332,What an absurd thing to say.
11333,California did not do well by any metric.
11334,We were the covid hotspot of the world this past winter.
11335,"We're middle of the pack as far as death rates go in the US, which is not something to be proud about considering how badly the US was hit."
11336,"The economic impact has been terrible too, with California having one of the highest unemployment rates in the US, tons of local businesses gone forever, and the homeless crisis has gotten way worse over the past year."
11337,I can't believe anyone would say we have done well.
11338,"Northern California has done well, sure, but that's just one part of the state."
11339,Southern California has been truly devestated.
11340,And that they thought HCQ/Ivermectin would make it so they didn’t have to use NPI’s.
11341,"Why distance when you have “the cure.”

Except well it’s not a cure at all."
11342,Thanks for the advice.
11343,Passed it along.
11344,She’ll get the test done and see what the doc says.
11345,"Based on what is reported, India and Brazil have 155 and 1,891 deaths per million."
11346,They don't seem to be that comparable.
11347,"Even Belgium, Czech Republic, and Italy have higher rates of death than Brazil."
11348,"Spain, Portugal, and France are trailing with 1,672 to 1,601 deaths per million as well."
11349,My comment is about purposefully scaring the public with data that reflects a different reality than the one being presented.
11350,Why do you people like you insist on discrediting the vaccine and other safety measures?
11351,"Seriously, you look ridiculous to the rest of us when you do this."
11352,[removed]
11353,Wouldn't be shocked if Kenneth Copeland tried to argue that.
11354,Bots are very active lol
11355,It's also a state where a group of extremists that dislike the lockdown planned to kidnap the governor...
11356,The part about countries accepting people with high antibodies instead of using negative Covid tests could be very discriminatory against people with certain autoimmune conditions because doctors think the vaccines won’t create as many antibodies in them.
11357,Lol the bots got to you
11358,&gt; he switched to angry old alcoholics and oxy addicts instead.
11359,"Because that's essentially who he became, at least in his opinions."
11360,"I stopped listening to him about 5 years ago because he just became angry, increasingly sexist, and way too opinionated given his level of knowledge and from the few times I've listened and heard from others he's just gotten worse in most of those areas."
11361,He turned into an angry old crank so now he far too often just gets people on with a similar personality so they can confirm their biases.
11362,It doesn't help that Joe Rogan just told young people not to get vaccinated because they don't need it.
11363,I wish people would listen to actual doctors.
11364,There is a huge difference between Israel’s green pass system and what states are doing.
11365,"I can’t tell if you’re being obtuse on purpose or from lack of knowledge, but at this point I don’t think it matters since you’re not making consistent arguments anyway."
11366,"Yeah, yeah, it's not that your vaccines aren't as smooth as you're trying to convince everyone, it's the people's fault."
11367,"What, blood clots are caused by anxiety too?"
11368,[removed]
11369,"Yes India is the only one to do this, US has always been very forthcoming of all those pits they dug."
11370,"/s

Let's not bring Cheena coz the bots will start doing their job."
11371,"Supposedly pfizer will deliver more the next few months, with 2M+ next month and 12M in June."
11372,"That’s not a lot, but will surely help."
11373,Meanwhile we have two laboratories making vaccines here in Brazil which are leading the vaccinations.
11374,You can't out exercise a bad diet.
11375,Weight loss starts with the eating habits and supplemented by N.E.A.T activity and work outs.
11376,But now he’s the grim reaper.
11377,I suspect the newer variants are causing higher viral load than previous versions of the virus.
11378,&gt;but we haven't had time to do those studies.
11379,"The original studies done for emergency authorization were the ones that determined that the mRNA vaccines were at minimum,  50% effective after 3 weeks in every case."
11380,So that's not even true.
11381,"The fact is, the CDC can't be trusted to provide consistent guidance based on the science."
11382,"How can a J&amp;J vaccinated person be fine to go about their day unmasked at 50% protection after 2 weeks, but mRNA vaccinated people who are *at minimum* 50% after 2 weeks have to wait 6 weeks?"
11383,It's bullshit that undermines the credibility of CDC guidance and I don't know why we are listening to them at all at this point.
11384,Darwinism at work.

11406,Awesome NJ!
11407,&gt; so long as people wear their mask.
11408,That's the missing piece of data.
11409,Did he and literally everyone else at the gym wear a mask and did the gym have the same or equitable clean air flow compared to being outdoors?
11410,"If not then the chance of spread increases, quite dramatically the fewer safety measures are enacted."
11411,"And health as far as I understand has not correlation with *catching* covid, just some correlation with not dying from it."
11412,I’ll just skip the first one too
11413,I think the fact that most of the population hasn't even had a common cold or flu in the last year or so means some of us might forget that vaccine side effects are still milder than basically almost anything else we might get during the year.
11414,"China obviously underreported deaths, but they did a better job containing the spread then almost any other country"
11415,The appropriate comparison is Oregon and Washington State.
11416,The highly populated areas in California had a ton of it other than San Francisco.
11417,The simplest explanation is usually the correct one.
11418,And the fact is that immunity is much better from natural infection than what most people are willing to admit
11419,[removed]
11420,You realize the 7 day average for vaccines administered was over 1mil when the Biden took office?
11421,The trajectory of the vaccine roll out did not change one bit.
11422,The 3 day average for deaths is a whopping 3 (three).
11423,"And before you say 

“Buh Actually deaths follow cases!!!"
11424,"!”

Not with the vaccine they don’t—people said that about MA and the rate has continued decreasing"
11425,Nope.
11426,Not at all.
11427,And you’re not the new punk rock or counter culture either.
11428,You’ve just been manipulated for so long into believing that you are you actually buy it now.
11429,"Sad....

Good luck on becoming that victim you want so badly to be."
11430,"A noble pursuit, no doubt."
11431,The reason they are having a surge is simple which is simply that fewer people got the virus there than almost anywhere else
11432,"&gt;Maybe, but we haven’t proven that and it can vary from person to person depending on age and immune system."
11433,There is evidence to suggest it's greater than 50%.
11434,It's not a guess.
11435,"The fact is, ask the evidence points to treating someone with their first shot of the mRNA vaccines identical to those getting J&amp;J: you are considered vaccinated and can participate under the vaccinated rules after 2 weeks, regardless of vaccine, as long as you are getting your second shot within the recommended window."
11436,"The point is, the CDC, once again, is undermining their credibility by not actually depending on science, but *lying* to the public about what is safe for some unclear political purpose."
11437,"Anyone with a simple understanding knows clearly they are being inconsistent with the *science,* and that generates mistrust."
11438,"I no longer listen to the CDC, I read the studies."
11439,Because the CDC can't be assed to make recommendations that actually follow science.
11440,"Hi, I've asked this question before but I haven't gotten a reply so asking again:

So the whole family has got Covid."
11441,The thing is my mom and brother have got it a week earlier than me and are close to having recovered.
11442,I only have a cough and have lost my sense of smell and taste.
11443,Is it okay for me to be near them or is there a chance they can get affected more because of me?
11444,Sorry if this is a stupid question.
11445,[removed]
11446,LOL I like it!
11447,You can still become infected and spread the virus after being fully vaccinated.
11448,"Hell, you can still die of covid after being fully vaccinated."
11449,It’s called “breakthrough” infection.
11450,Hospitals all around the country are dealing with multiple breakthrough cases every week.
11451,Wear your damn mask.
11452,Yes indeed!
11453,Gonna be many people putting themselves in the hospital or worse once enough people are vaccinated to fully open up society again.
11454,I will never understand that level of stupid.
11455,[removed]
11456,India seemed to have handled the virus pretty well for a year.
11457,Vaccinating canadians helps the states cause they are our biggest export market
11458,"What I completely fail to understand is why the same people who oppose safety measures, such as social distancing and masks, and desire to reopen, are also opposed to the vaccine."
11459,"If they get vaccinated it'll be a win-win situation: governments can reopen safely, even dropping masks, while the numbers keep tumbling down."
11460,"Log\_10 of 1 = 0

Log\_10 of 10 = 1

Log\_10 of 7 = .85

You're basically arguing that .85 is closer to 0 than to 1 right now."
11461,Indian variant to blame
11462,How many people are alive under 40?
11463,How many people are alive over 80?
11464,Exactly.
11465,This is why normalization is important for data science and statistics.
11466,Another failure of the American education system.
11467,"I too commonly hear a stance along the lines of fuck any math topic above basic arithmetic, I'll never need it, I have a calculator in my pocket."
11468,"&gt;Alabama was at the bottom of national rankings for vaccination rates as of Friday, and the numbers are heading in the wrong direction."
11469,"&gt;Just 32 percent of Alabama’s population had gotten at least one dose of a COVID vaccine, according to data from the Center for Disease Control and Prevention."
11470,"That put Alabama ahead of just one state, neighboring Mississippi."
11471,"&gt;But when it comes to full vaccinations, which require a second shot for Moderna and Pfizer, only 21 percent of Alabamians are completely vaccinated."
11472,That’s the lowest mark in the nation.
11473,"The US should be at herd immunity by june, and with the current US capacity I would assume canada will be finished just a week or two after  (much smaller population)

So yes"
11474,"This depends heavily on who is getting tested, if most of your results are repeats from universities or workplaces, the only metric you really have left is hospitalizations or deaths."
11475,"I don't see many random people getting tested anymore, the public sites here are quite empty."
11476,I would really like food service to keep wearing them after.
11477,One thing this pandemic has made me aware of is how much strangers are breathing on our food in restaurants.
11478,"Seriously, in what world is 7x considered ""on the same order of magnitude""?"
11479,It's highly misleading.
11480,"People say ""same order of magnitude"" about things that are 0.5-2x as much as something, to remind people that those figures aren't grossly out of line with each other."
11481,"As soon as something is 3x or more, I think it becomes very misleading to just slap a logarithm on your figures and pretend they're the same."
11482,"7x is also much closer to 10x than 1x, so even logarithmically speaking, it's closer to another order of magnitude anyway."
11483,Israel and the UK were/are on lockdown while their rollout was happening.
11484,"It seems the US has been mostly open, so it takes longer for the vaccines to bring deaths and cases down to negligible levels."
11485,Just like China and their crematoriums running 24/7 and all of the urns of ashes to be claimed.
11486,"April 3, 2020- https://time.com/5811222/wuhan-coronavirus-death-toll/"
11487,So multiply by four basically..
11488,Do you and some of the others on this thread understand what the *pan-* in pandemic means?
11489,"Even if US got 100% of its population vaccinated and things went back to normal, a highly transmissible and potentially vaccine resistant strain arrives in the country and *boom* another pandemic begins."
11490,"Also, it's extremely naive to think coronavirus vaccine research, which has been happening for over a decade, was all done by the US."
11491,There's way more global collaboration in vaccine research and development in general than what people like you and others in this thread like to give credit for.
11492,Thats impressive!
11493,Is this being verfied by an independent source cause idk if I can trust the CCP

11503,At this point are vaccines even effective?
11504,"With multiple variants and a double mutation from india, how effective are these vaccines now?"
11505,This randomly came out last night with no press conference and no guidance so DC Twitter is...a bit confused right now.
11506,Presumably Mayor Bowser will say...something to clarify...any of this soon.
11507,I am more than happy to be proven wrong.
11508,Really.
11509,But most people just keep their head down and do what they’re told.
11510,They will obey their boss no matter how dumb the rules are.
11511,"Here is an example:
You have to put your mask on, walk through a restaurant and take it off to eat."
11512,You don’t have to be a scientist to see that it’s just bat-shot crazy.
11513,"This is a rule that makes absolutely no sense, yet here we are."
11514,I genuinely can’t imagine going through life thinking human life is so cheap and expendable.
11515,Their numbers from what I can see anyway aren’t even that terrible
11516,"So you think they're out partying with friends rather than working jobs that aren't workable from home (food server, warehouse, etc.)."
11517,You're very small minded
11518,Lol.
11519,Reddit is absurd.
11520,“Everyone has a responsibility to get vaccinated” is racist?
11521,There are a gazillion ways to work out not at the gym.
11522,"I know it's not ""exactly the same"" but even if you can't afford weights there are ways to use your body as its own weight, etc."
11523,"And running, walking outside."

11535,I wasn't aware of that.
11536,That's great!
11537,I just like giving people the benefit of doubt.
11538,"Given these are people who have taken the first dose, they're obviously not hesitant."
11539,So it must be about convenience in some way.
11540,In india our vaccination coverage is 1%.
11541,So most old people too are not vaccinated.
11542,"Yet the new strain is hitting young people (35-45) too very hard, with a vengence not seen in the earlier wave."
11543,"Multiple friends of mine in india were hospitalized, luckily they survived after a very bad illness"
11544,Probably about 6 to 8 weeks since vaccinations haven't been that easily available in Portland until recently.
11545,"We only opened up vaccines to everyone  on the 19th, so she has to give that group a fair chance to get vaccinated."
11546,"Yeah, I did have to take two days off work to deal with side effects."
11547,Fortunately I had time but not everyone does.
11548,Their vaccination rate is right on top of the national average.
11549,No way the recent surge is due to vaccine hesitancy.
11550,800 per day is 8x higher than 100 how is this far from disastrous?
11551,On top of that the 100 number is based on mathematical models that overestimate the number of flu deaths not actual laboratory tests.
11552,They look at probable cases of influenza from death certificates and hospital deaths.
11553,That is for the US estimate.
11554,The UN annual estimate of influenza **worldwide** deaths(290k-650k) is almost as much as the total number of deaths from coronavirus in usa alone.
11555,So im really confused where you get that 10x less deadly from the flu.
11556,"If you're comparing current data of coeonavieus vs flu currently flu is almost erradicated because of our health measures, so even at that what you're saying makes no sense."
11557,"And you're saying all of this assuming there is no new variant that is even worse, which would be extremely optimistic since there is currently a variant that doesn't have the mutation self correction gene which makes mutations and variants way more likely."
11558,So what do you want?
11559,They can say “the variant from India”.
11560,It’s still from India.
11561,You can’t cloud facts.

11588,This is anti-vax nonsense and should be pointed out as such.
11589,It's not rational and is going to lead to less people getting vaccinate because we aren't being honest about how great the vaccines are.
11590,"I literally said 0.85 is less than 1, which it is."
11591,I don't know why you need to claim I said a different thing.
11592,why isnt florida immune then?
11593,"florida has had slightly more cases and deaths per capita than california has had, yet they are currently being slammed by cases, as they currently have about 6 times more new cases per capita than california does."
11594,both are also warm states so thats not a valid excuse either.

11602,Wtf does even triple variant mean?
11603,That it has several mutations?
11604,"Yeah, this is normal."
11605,Triple duper ultra killer mega variant 3X Super boom my ass
11606,Does ourworldindata have an option for that?
11607,I can never manage to navigate all their different available graphs.

11609,Awesome!
11610,Wish someone shared this earlier.
11611,I've complained online about literally not being able to breathe a few times and everyone told me it's not that bad and to suck it up.
11612,Thank you from a very sweaty Italian that wants to run again!
11613,If you have any doubts consult your doctor (but be smart enough to listen to him!)
11614,"Chances are good that you have added many years of life with the vaccine, in my country most of the population took both vaccines and everything is fine - Do not forget the second dose after 21 days!"
11615,"I'd love that to be true, but this is the schedule [straight from the BC Government website](https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/covid-19/vaccine/plan)."
11616,18 year olds are scheduled for June.
11617,"They will indeed be starting 2nd shots in May as that's 4 months from when they started the February shots, but people getting their first shots in June are still set to receive their second shot in October."
11618,The only thing that would change would be a drastic increase in vaccine shipments.
11619,"https://www.google.ca/amp/s/beta.ctvnews.ca/national/coronavirus/2020/10/19/1_5152124.html

“Staff and members were screened upon entry, masks were worn before and after class, rooms were cleaned within 30 minutes of a session being completed and all those who attended were asked for contact information.”"
11620,How can you smell on the internet
11621,"Viruses typically mutate toward lower mortality rates, particularly coronaviruses (or so I’ve read)."
11622,"There’s a chance that these pick up a deadly mutation along the way, but what is more likely is that they evolve in favor of transmissibility and away from mortality."
11623,A crappy-feeling host is much less capable of spreading disease than someone with the sniffles wandering around in public.
11624,People (especially on here) love to prop up stories of terrible complications/outcomes from covid but don’t want to hear the common story that the persons course was minor/felt like a rough flu.
11625,"Both my 80+ year old grandparents had it, one had a rough 10 days but neither was hospitalized, now they’re doing fine."
11626,Shouldn’t we be equally concerned that if we suppress the idea that the majority people can handle this once-in-century pandemic fairly easily that most people will not believe the warnings if a more severe disease comes along in the future?
11627,Great that they’ve sent experts to set up mobile oxygen units.
11628,"Praying for success for them, they really need the oxygen."
11629,Not many are dead.
11630,I guess that maybe 1 to 5 percent of people over 80 who were alive on January 2020 died from covid.
11631,Very
11632,We basically already know the long term effects of the vaccines.
11633,"Historically, long term issues with vaccines show up within 3 months of getting the vaccine."
11634,"So, we would have already seen long term issues by now if there were any."
11635,"Not N95's, but you might have more luck with other certifications like KN95, KF94 and FFP2."
11636,[Here's](https://www.yahoo.com/lifestyle/vida-kids-kn95-172525449.html) an article claiming there are KN95's for children.
11637,"&gt;B117

Ahhh, COVID Classic!"
11638,Huh?
11639,How does this make sense or are you joking?
11640,"&gt;people who oppose safety measures

Vaccine is also a safety measure."
11641,They're consistent 🤙
11642,There won't be such sttain.
11643,IFR is unlikely to go up.
11644,There is no evolutionary reason for virus to be more deadly.
11645,"no demo is a monolith, and let me put it this way, while ""certain groups"" are generally opposed to safety measures and vaccines, within that group, there exists a segment which is wealthy and educated, and they understand the science and the safety behind the vaccines and have had the ability to get early access to them as well"
11646,&gt;	Not being able to read a face can really throw you off.
11647,Super underrated aspect of the masks.
11648,Well put.
11649,[removed]
11650,"I’m not gonna go into details, but between alcohol, the location, and the amount of people I was with last night, it was beyond normal."
11651,I’ve been waiting to feel that way for 15 months.
11652,Feels good man
11653,Do you have a vent fan or something?
11654,"Even without ventilation, it seems an incredibly small risk."
11655,Good luck.
11656,This is a hard task you are doing.
11657,I'm a Michigander all my life.. Me and my roommate will be getting our 2nd shot this coming Tuesday.. We live on a street in Wyandotte where we're the only ones that have gotten shots with the other younger neighbors zero shots cause they all think because their young they won't get Covid19
11658,We’re seeing them all.
11659,We’ve just located B.1.617 variant from India for the first time this week.
11660,My sister said this to me yesterday.
11661,She said I should not get vaccinated but let my immune system strengthen like she does.
11662,She is currently sick (probably with a bad cold).
11663,Her **fifth** cold in a year.
11664,He rejected his humanity
11665,You also get herd immunity from people being infected.
11666,That's basic stuff.
11667,"If they won't get vaccinated (they have no obligation to do so), they maybe will catch it later, therefore helping establish herd immunity."
11668,"Yeah they were already positive and I tested positive a week after them, thought I started getting the classic symptoms a few days after they tested positive."
11669,Thanks for the reply!
11670,Will wear a mask around them.
11671,"That sounds like an anxiety reaction, not a vaccine reaction."
11672,The labeling is somewhat akin to calling smoking deaths breathing deaths.
11673,"Silver's reasoning has validity, but there's a bad aspect of what's going on too."
11674,"[This graph](https://www.mlive.com/resizer/86v1e7Apdm4-zWbHd-9Q7X4rAh0=/1280x0/smart/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/advancelocal/RPEUG3IW5JGXTF6HQYL2RBK67U.png) from the article shows that, compared to the December peak in the area, the *absolute number* of young people (all groups 18 to 59) has increased."
11675,It's good that the proportion is skewed away from older people.
11676,"But it's bad that, for example, in the 30-39 age range, there were 26 hospital admissions per day in the December time period and that has increased to 41 per day in the April 17-23 time period."
11677,"In other words, there's a surge right now and younger people haven't gotten vaccinated enough to protect themselves against that surge."
11678,It’s horrible to watch.
11679,Not knowing how to help is part of the issue.
11680,Oh sure.
11681,But I am surprised the company’s are prepared to waste money.
11682,You're getting downvoted because this is exactly what was thought would happen with restrictions that not everyone followed.
11683,Death isn't the only consequence.
11684,We are seeing many young people with sudden onset shortness of breath with no history of asthma.
11685,Plain film shows lung fibrosis.
11686,"Who knows how widespread or deadly this will.be, we have no long term studies on covid."
11687,"Your odds of getting mumps is incredibly small, less than getting into an accident in a parking lot."
11688,"But we still vaccinate because sometimes, mumps can be dangerous if you get it."
11689,"I’ve had trouble finding news from other countries outside the US, some of Europe, Brazil and now India."
11690,Just yesterday there was an article about Tunisia and I had heard nothing before that post.
11691,It’s frustrating.
11692,Maybe people can post articles from their own countries?
11693,There is a translator bot but you need to translate the title I think.
11694,[removed]
11695,"According to science, masks protect the person you interact with, not the person who wear them."
11696,People not wearing masks don't have higher chance of catching covid then - according to science.
11697,Where can I find statistics for vaccination by age group in India?
11698,"Alternatively, what % of Indian over 65's are vaccinated?"
11699,"Kind of upsetting that this was published an entire month ago, and only now getting some wider recognition."
11700,"Wish I would have seen this sooner, got my first shot of Pfizer almost 3 weeks ago."
11701,It might have affected my risk-reward analysis :/
11702,"If vaccine rates had continued, they would be a magic bullet."
11703,The problem is reluctance.
11704,We'd end it in a few months if it wasn't for people refusing the vaccine.
11705,"First shot gave me immense arm pain, 2nd shot gave me less arm pain and tiredness for 2 days."
11706,"Honestly, the best part is the following week I felt like superman, I slept so much I had so much energy the following week."
11707,"400k seems a lot, but with 1.3b people they can keep this number up for 10 years, every day."
11708,"Bro, you are already vaccinated."
11709,Being scared now is just plain stupid.
11710,"You don't have to ever leave your house again, I don't care too much, but you should know that the risk here would be miniscule."
11711,"Like, the method of transport itself probably would have a better chance of killing you than catching covid."
11712,He's not wrong though.
11713,"If people continued to vaccinate, we could end the pandemic in the US in a few months because the vaccines are that good."
11714,The problem is that people won't fucking get vaccinated.
11715,What's the point in doing 75% ?
11716,Your still gonna have people right next to each other
11717,[removed]
11718,Got the covid vaccine around 2:00 P.M. yesterday and I'm still nauseous.
11719,"Anytime I eat anything, it just makes me feel sick."
11720,"I'm hoping this goes away soon :(   It gives me the same feeling as when I eat eggs, but the doctor said my slight egg allergy shouldn't be a big deal."
11721,I'm just tired of eating food at the moment.
11722,This outbreak appears to be mostly driven by people who aren't vaccinated.
11723,The valid reasoning was that a vaccinated person can still be infected even if they don’t develop disease.
11724,We know that coronavirus can spread through asymptomatic spread.
11725,So the thought was the vaccinated people could be asymptomatic spreaders.
11726,Vaccination rates are low for latinos and blacks compared to whites and asians.
11727,Saw it on the local news for my state.
11728,Bingo!
11729,You couldn't have said it better!
11730,Is it true that certain antibiotics can cause a reaction that can make your skin blister and fall off?
11731,Yes.
11732,Should we make that well known?
11733,I don’t think so.
11734,The benefits that the general population receive from using antibiotics far outweighs the risk of those reactions occurring.
11735,"Similarly, with covid, I would agree that we should make people aware that this virus is particularly deadly for certain populations and we should do our part to mitigate spread (masking, vaccinations)."
11736,"But I don’t think that we need to further emphasize the fact that rare, severe infection can occur in otherwise low-risk populations."
11737,"Sure, it can happen, but I don’t think people should be making their decisions based on very rare occurrences."
11738,They should do it to help those at risk and otherwise act accordingly.
11739,What's the old pro-life criticism?
11740,"They hate abortion but also hate welfare and public schools, so they want the kids to be alive but without food or a quality education."
11741,My point is quality of life matters too.
11742,Saving every life but making those lives not worth living is fucking inhumane.
11743,"The lockdowns are a humanitarian crisis too, so being realistic about exactly how bad the pandemic is going is a moral imperative."
11744,"Human life isn't cheap, but mere life doesn't have infinite value, being allowed to fly to see your grandchild's birth also has value."
11745,Maybe because it's not facts?
11746,Isn't it regional?
11747,"Dr John Campbell on YouTube had a segment about how in Mumbai it's still mostly the UK variant but in other parts it's the ""double"" mutation Indian variant."
11748,I think we don't really pay enough attention to how localized an outbreak can be.
11749,For example a lot of the US's second wave was actually places that hadn't really gotten hit before having their first wave.
11750,We just grouped Florida with New York even though they were really each doing their own thing.
11751,[removed]
11752,In other news the sun is hot
11753,"Yeah, like 2000x lower."
11754,"&gt;The flu 

NOPE."
11755,&gt;800 deaths per day..is very far from disastrous.
11756,WRONG.
11757,"&gt;Covid is now less than 10 times as deadly as the flu

INCORRECT, UNFACTUAL BS."
11758,What do you think is more important here?
11759,Being behind in vaccinations or preventing deaths per capita?
11760,The richest country in the world could have prevented so many deaths but decided against it.
11761,Canada will have enough vaccines to vaccinate its entire adult population fully end of July (based on delivery schedule).
11762,"By then, America will still have more deaths per capita than them."
11763,[deleted]
11764,NJ had the most deaths per capita if any state.
11765,Something like over a quarter percent of the population died.
11766,This means probably over half the state got it.
11767,"Furthermore, they got high vaccination rate and have more regulations than other states."
11768,"If COVID isn't being destroyed there, it won't be destroyed anywhere in America."
11769,Sounds like a lot of people in India are going to die then :/

11789,Yup!
11790,I'm just hoping that first-dose vaccinations get back going in the next week or two.
11791,Requiring it also gives them an excuse.
11792,There's no point in letting irrational people control your choices.
11793,That's a losing game.
11794,The reward is keeping people you care about safe.
11795,Has those who are hospitalized and under 40 been vaccinated.
11796,If they have then that means the vaccines didnt stop the virus or it is a totally new virus that the vaccine does not cover or the vaccine created the new virus that put them in the hospital.
11797,We have to look at every angle.
11798,This could be very bad for the human race is the virus mutated from any way possible.
11799,Remember we do not understand this illness yet so many seem to drop their guard after the jab.

11802,Strawman much?
11803,"Yes *obviously* it's a critical shortage, which is exactly why it makes no sense for the richest countries to preorder and hoard up on a vaccine supply for 150-500% of their populations."
11804,"By the end of January, 16% of the global population had 60% of the vaccine supply."

11808,Deaths will start dropping now cases are dropping.
11809,It's a pretty awful reaction to say we're handling the pandemic poorly due to one part.
11810,"Especially when that one part, Canada IS doing pretty well in comparison to many countries."
11811,We just don't stack up to countries that either have significant domestic production and/or use vaccines that we have not approved.
11812,The country expects to have enough deliveries to fully vaccinate its adult population end of July.
11813,Appointments can absolutely be moved up.

11832,explain to me step by step how to do this because my employer is not doing this.
11833,But… the entire world plays video games.
11834,"There are literally billions of gamers, some of which started playing video games in the 80’s."
11835,"Maybe Russia will invade the US in VR…

Also, by that logic, TV is much more dangerous than video games."
11836,"Less involving, more popular, more brain-numbing."

11840,"We do not all start with the same deck of cards, we do not all have the same capacity or circumstances to beat this."
11841,It's an illness and looking down on people for not having the self control required to fix it is like looking down on someone dying from alcoholism for buying another bottle; The self control issue IS the obesity issue.
11842,"And as is pretty apparent to anyone with a brain cell, companies are seeking to addict kids before they can even think for themselves to harvest them for all their worth."
11843,"Let's talk about the personal responsibility of the literal vampires behind this shit perhaps, and stop blaming the people suffering from it?"
11844,"Regardless of how unhesitant they are, their vaccination rate doesn't appear to be anything too far out of the ordinary."
11845,They are getting a bump from natural infections I have no doubt.
11846,"Yes, but not a ""de facto"" ban."
11847,I've seen figure ranges from 22k-60k for 19-20 just not from official CDC article releases.
11848,"I think the 19-20 figures are probably the most relevant to the conversation(as 20-21 is null), picking out data from 4-5 years ago to support a point is just downright silly."
11849,The difference is drastic - as in 60 deaths per day vs 167.

 getting the second shot and it was a shitshow."
11855,Went to the stockroom and found another employee kneeling on the ground trying desperately to process stock while super sick.
11856,A couple people had to call out because the side effects were that strong and got demerits for doing so.
11857,If we call out we get a demerit and some people are either on final warning so calling out after the shot would get them fired or they simply can't afford to miss that day of pay because they're paycheck to paycheck.

11862,If you have a great workout setup and don't need the gym that's great.
11863,Same here but we need to be honest about the fact that we take risks every day of our lives and a bunch of them are significantly more risky than going to a gym while fully vaccinated.
11864,&gt; Most of the country is in good or great shape.
11865,"Only a few states have had serious outbreaks recently

Covid is still spreading in many states and tens of thousands (or over 100,000) people will die from COVID."
11866,"Yes, things are better, but many people the US will stop being careful now, and millions will refuse to get the vaccine."
11867,"I think 6 months from now things will be much better, but in the next 2 months so many people will die from COVID."
11868,We haven't even started vaccinating children which means over 40% of the population will not get vaccinated in the next 2 months or longer.
11869,Got my second Pfizer shot today.

11875,"They're just a few weeks behind the US in first doses, and far ahead of all but ~5 countries in the world."
11876,"They're vaccinating young people alongside the elderly,  which every model that's assumed vaccines prevent spread shows is superior to vaccinating the elderly first."
11877,"And they're delaying second doses,  which will get them to herd immunity much faster and probably give better long-term immunity for everyone."
11878,Hospitals have not been turning away patients for a long time.
11879,"Luckily, the American health care system didn't get to that point (only a few areas in some peak times did that happen)."
11880,What is happening now is a legitimate rise in young people 1) having to go to the hospital in the first place and 2) needing to get admitted.
11881,"This isn't a capacity issue at all, and is absolutely bad news."
11882,"We're in one of the most dangerous times in the pandemic; it's widespread, it's seemingly more contagious, and people are tired of restrictions."

11994,Lol.
11995,I am a doctor.
11996,Not just an armchair one.
11997,The article says that the booster shot helps with the variants and length of immunity.
11998,Didn’t go much into it tho
11999,If you test positive for antibodies against the N protein then you've probably been infected.
12000,It's not always clear when you get a test which antibody is being tested for.
12001,Antibodies for the S protein are likely from the vaccine.
12002,Depending on when you got sick your antibody levels may be low by now.
12003,Absolutely.

12014,Definitely wasn't expecting it to feel as good as it did.
12015,The point is to stop it from transmitting.
12016,There are people at every age range who cannot get vaccinated because of their health situation.

12018,"To slow down the spread and protect those at serious risk, whether they are old or young."
12019,"Yes, personal responsibility and rationality can absolutely tame a raging mental illness, sure."
12020,Because they generally don't trust the companies behind the vaccines?
12021,"I'm vaccinated, but let's not pretend that the pharmaceutical industry has a very golden track record."
12022,It sure plays a part.
12023,They are demand constrained with more than 21 days of supply of the vaccine on hand.
12024,"Oregon has had COVID well controlled during the whole pandemic, so their effective seropositive rate is actually lower than almost any other state even with high rates of vaccination."
12025,"For example, Alabama only has a 32% first doses (all residents) but they have had about 43% of their population infected with COVID (assuming a 4X undercount rate)."
12026,Oregon has had less than 18% of their population infected and 44% first doses.
12027,"Assuming COVID infection does not impact likelihood to vaccinate (it probably does with a negative correlation), this means that Alabama has (32%)+(68%\*43%)=**61%** of their population with antibodies."
12028,Oregon has (44%)+(56%\*18%)=**54%** of their population with antibodies.
12029,"And this ignores the likely negative correlation between infection and vaccination and the two week lag before the first dose has any effect, and that first dose immunity is not as strong as immunity created from actual infection."
12030,"While it's unrealistic to assume all 800K could be administered right away, with over 800K doses delivered but not used, that's enough for another 15-20% of the population to get the first dose."
12031,Vaccine hesitancy matters.
12032,Wrong.
12033,Check this [report](https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/documents/chmp-annex/annex-vaxzevria-art53-visual-risk-contextualisation_en.pdf) from EMA itself where they compare the risk by age and infection rate.

12048,I wish there were more positive vibes around the vaccine because the coverage is almost exclusively negative.
12049,One of the cool things about my vaccine site was they kept it really cheeky and casual.
12050,"It was at a basketball arena at a local state school, and there were many volunteers with pom-poms, a life size cutout of Dr. Fauci, alt rock music and a video screen playing, and there was just so much smiling going on."

12052,"I've seen plenty of pictures from other vaccination sites, and I see they weren't all like that."
12053,"In addition, you only ever hear from the people who had severe symptoms from the vaccine, and you see non-stop coverage about the literally fewer than one in million blood clots in one type of vaccine (which are treatable, by the way, and not automatically fatal)."
12054,"When people ask on Facebook how the vaccine was, the people who respond all had 104 fevers for three days."
12055,"But when you ask people individually how the vaccine was, most of them say that it was no big deal."
12056,"It's just there's so much amplification of negativity, and I don't know how we change that."
12057,"There are some people who like to know about even the one in a million chance of something happening, and then are able to rationalize it as a risk worth taking vs. the alternative (taking your chances with the disease and contributing to its spread)."
12058,But there are people who really are best off not hearing about the one in a million chance over and over again.
12059,"I know it's a gross simplification to talk about the power of positive thinking with regards to people's anxieties, but a general positive vibe surrounding vaccination and what it's doing for all of us would be a really fine thing, wouldn't it?"
12060,I think it would help people at least somewhat.

12120,Not breeding ground.
12121,Transmission ground... if people don't have masks on.
12122,the CDC saying you still need to be cautious while fully vaccinated leads people to fail to understand that vaccines greatly reduce transition and essentially eliminate the risk of hospitalization.
12123,Which leads to people failing to understand that by far the number #1 reason for falling cases is vaccinations.
12124,The two are clearly connected.
12125,I don't think the CDC is evil and think they have a really hard job but I do think the two things are absolutely related and we would be better off if they emphasized more clearly that groups of vaccinated people hanging out together is totally safe and frankly should be encouraged after the year we've had.
12126,"I'm very grateful Biden is our president but there is no good reason not to have a fully packed address of vaccinated and tested legislators and justices last week and say ""this is what we get to do safely after getting vaccinated""."

12163,I would 100% say I had body aches after both shots...but I would not at all say I had a shitty time after either doses.
12164,Just felt like I usually do when I start to get sick.
12165,That's when you lie and don't tell them it's your second dose.
12166,get tested?
12167,You don’t even understand what I’m trying to say.
12168,I’m saying there is obviously going to be more people under 40 because there are more people that are under 40 and less people over 80.

12173,I obviously can't set up mass vaccination sites anywhere.
12174,I could go online and encourage people in India to get vaccinated but that's useless because it seems like people there do want to be vaccinated and they don't have the resources to put shots in arms.
12175,I feel incredibly helpless.
12176,What if all kids can't get the vaccine till 2022?
12177,I intend to continue masking up in public through at least end of 2021 even after vaccination.
12178,I expect to get weird looks even here in Philly after the 1st half of this year ends.
12179,I'm not yet sure what trigger will be the one that makes me stop wearing it in public out of habit.

12198,They did tell me testing numbers are way up and quite a bit of the positives were vaccinated people.
12199,This sub does a great job of spreading fear though.
12200,Women have been dismissed by the medical establishment for-ev-er as just having “high stress and anxiety”.
12201,It feels disheartening to see us encouraging this blanket excuse for people’s experiences from the vaccine.
12202,Especially since these vaccines are in their very first round of studies in humans.
12203,Our medical establishment gets away with dismissing too many of us with hard to diagnose symptoms and I feel like this is only going to make it worse.

12210,Antibodies also aren't a great analog for efficacy in the real world.
12211,"It is useful for sure, but the immune system is more complex than just antibody counts."
12212,"At best an antibody test is a good precursor towards a more accurate study, but we really need large scale controlled studies to say anything specific about efficacy towards disease or infection."
12213,My point here is just that a test of Sputnik V against variants common in Russia months ago isn't particularly useful for deciding efficacy in a different population with different variants.
12214,"Same doe comparing different vaccines, we can't assume one will work because another did."
12215,You’re equating very different vaccines with very different protocols.
12216,That means you don’t understand the science.
12217,Of course many people reach more than 50% efficacy two weeks after the first mRNA dose.
12218,I said that very clearly.
12219,But not everyone will get the same efficacy from one mRNA dose.
12220,"If there are any immune conditions, if they are elderly they can have a drastically reduced efficacy from only one dose."
12221,"&gt;In a multistate network of U.S. hospitals during January–March 2021, receipt of Pfizer-BioNTech or Moderna COVID-19 vaccines was 94% effective against COVID-19 hospitalization among fully vaccinated adults and 64% effective among partially vaccinated adults aged ≥65 years."

The only reason to delay a second dose of mRNA vaccine would be to cover more people in a population quicker when vaccines are in short supply."
12223,It would mean leaving certain groups more vulnerable for greater average safety.
12224,"There is no reason to pursue that strategy in the US right now, when there is no shortage of vaccine and we need as many people fully vaccinated as possible to help build herd immunity"

12438,In terms of pure volume it’s not impossible that we could see tens of millions of more infections.
12439,That’s a lot of opportunity for significant mutation.
12440,Ah the modern news article written to deliberately insult the reader's intelligence.
12441,"We are told that ""anecdotes are not data."""
12442,But what do these articles invariably start with?
12443,An anecdote.
12444,A very very carefully selected anecdote.
12445,Only how pray tell is a very busy journalist supposed to will on the spot an anecdote that precisely fits the narrative?
12446,No wonder some of these anecdotes turn out to be fabrications.
12447,There is alleged vaccine hesitancy.
12448,Only two facts immediately refute such an idea.
12449,Even the article can't claim the elderly are refusing the vaccine in any significant numbers.
12450,"So why aren't they, the least technologically sophisticated, even more vulnerable to being influenced by social media posts by their friends?"
12451,"Also for all the claims that there are open spots for doses that are not being used, if you ask any of the authorities involved in distributing and administering doses, they will all assert that there is almost no wastage."
12452,No wastage means there is no significant vaccine hesitancy.
12453,Then how can one explain the supposed data in the article that relatively high percentages of frontline workers are refusing to be vaccinated **at this moment**.
12454,There is an obvious explanation -- because many of them have already had COVID-19.
12455,They are simply waiting for additional data to show that getting vaccinated on top of whatever natural immunity they have will help them and not have some unintended side effect.
12456,But that brings us back to the deceptiveness and the manipulation of the anecdote chosen for the story.
12457,This person so happens to have family members with comorbidities and apparently they must have somehow not come down with the illness?

12580,Thank you!
12581,I am in the same boat as you.
12582,Is the fact that you'll be able to socialise freely not enough of a motivator than not having to wear a mask during an activity that most people don't do often?
12583,From Pfizer my arm was sore for like three weeks.
12584,I was kind of surprised.
12585,That was the second vaccine.
12586,I had only had a reaction to the 2020 flu shot before- that was a sore arm too.
12587,But this was insane.
12588,The flu shot wasn’t that bad- one other person had never reacted and reacted this year.

12595,Maybe in the last administration but this new administration has a habit of putting low expecations first and beating that.
12596,"For example, Biden said 100 million vaccinations by his first 100 days."
12597,It got doubled.
12598,"He said all adults will start receiving vaccination by May 1st, it happened earlier than that."

12604,I don’t think it will be as common in the west as you think.
12605,Most people here cannot wait for the day where they no longer have to wear a mask.
12606,A year from now it will be the weird people who are still wearing masks.
12607,Are you in favor of reenacting that policy?
12608,Name any EUA vax that is relevant to 18-22 year olds.

12610,Everyone gets $1k and mask mandates drop entirely at 70% adults.
12611,"It's a moral dilemma and has nothing to do with a 17 year old kids decision

Should a university be able to ""force"" a kid to take a vaccine that has not been approved by the FDA?"

12690,Like OSU in Oregon State...
12691,Why is there such a high difference between the number of women and men infected?
12692,Deaths seem a bit heavier for men than expected though.
12693,"I believe they said they didn’t test the first dose, but tested the second dose and found the replicating virus in the second doses."

12695,Russia can do great science and engineering but their ability to scale is known to be so-so.

12713,"In a place where I would have expected more negative impact from economic disparity, deployment sites, transportation, time off from work, etc, to have impacted the rates of vaccination of black people, we've actually done pretty well."
12714,The uptake rate pro-rata the population level of both white and black people in Alabama has moved pretty much in lockstep.

12730,Weekly shipments of Pfizer were 1 million doses.
12731,So the increase to 2 million weekly doses in may not headline gore
12732,Having had to do this (healthcare) I can tell you there are legal ways to get that information.

12756,"Lockdown ""skeptic"" alert!"

12759,"If anything, they're being overzealous about it."
12760,"But I particularly like the approach that more states are taking now, where they tie reopening to overall vaccination percentages."

12800,Granted I'm Canadian so the process will be different.
12801,In elementary school and high school you are required to show proof bc I think the public health contacts the school to verify if they themselves haven't been verified.
12802,I only sort of know that bc I was pulled out of class both times to either go get my vaccine or go get the record.

12818,You’re applying logic against a decision based on emotion from false beliefs (but beliefs nonetheless).
12819,Logic rarely defeats emotion and is least effective against false beliefs.
12820,I agree with your intended prediction that many will stay as “no” because they’ll be fully vested in the decision by then.

12823,"Young people don't really need it though - with comparable rates of death from clots and rona for the young, and doubts over whether the poke stops transmission, this is actually a pointless policy by the look of it."

Vaccine trials are long since over."
12837,"I think 50% are partially vaccinated, so we should hit at least 50%"
12838,I don’t think kids who do all that are as worried about getting vaccinated.
12839,I think there are more lives to be saved by sending food to other third world countries.
12840,Probably save more lives for less money.
12841,One of them was a redditor
12842,Now you’re catching on.
12843,Show me proof he doesn’t exist.
12844,"There’s equal amounts of evidence proving and disproving his existence, none."
12845,"Let people be religious if they want, it’s not that complicated."
12846,Crazy antivaxxers.
12847,Very true.
12848,Thank you!
12849,I really don't see how that is excessive given COVID.
12850,"Some people are living with elders or other high risk people right now and want to take every precaution available to protect their loved ones, I don't see this as a negative for those in that situation."
12851,Making fun of these people for being safe isn't helping anybody and causes more issues.
12852,If it doesn't effect you than why give it a second thought?
12853,Nobody is forcing you to do anything beyond the minimum and even the minimum is finally lightening up.
12854,"Stop being so worried about background characters in your life being safer than needed, you should be happy they are being extra safe."
12855,"Thank you, that’s a good pep talk ..."
12856,I appreciate it!
12857,I’m surprised they don’t provide a 1 dose option with this information for Pfizer and Moderna.
12858,I just got the 2nd dose of Pfizer yesterday and it is absolutely wrecking me today.
12859,"101.3 fever, hand shaking chills, severe headache, and a sharp pain in my armpit on the side the shot was given."
12860,It is no joke.
12861,I’m young and healthy and only got the shot to protect others.
12862,I’d rather donate my second dose to someone in India who is higher risk.
12863,I’m okay with this.
12864,Not if you get a regular ole general discharge and a good RE code.
12865,There's a precedent for viruses causing problems years down the line.
12866,"Take chicken pox and shingles, for example."
12867,Or HPV and cervical cancer.
12868,"There's never been a vaccine side effect that has cropped up problems months Later with no warning, and there's no plausible mechanism by which that could happen."
12869,Yeah I have a lot of acquaintances in that camp.
12870,I think people really underestimate the emotional trauma people have suffered and will continue to suffer long after this is over.
12871,It’s already too late.
12872,The variants are already out there.
12873,"Clarity on a couple points here: 

Many areas in Canada are now 18+ (some even 16+)."
12874,The recommended timeframes are still developing.
12875,"The original 2 weeks time frame want the best out of many tested use cases, it was the first one validated."
12876,Being recommended first doesn’t mean recommended ‘best’.
12877,"While still being validated, there is a body of evidence (not a huge amount, but certainly growing) that supports some societal benefit on the extension on the 2-week interval."
12878,"As a matter of public health, getting 1 dose into as many people as possible is showing to be much more effective at reducing the effective R value than fully vaccinating half the people."
12879,"As a matter of personal health, yes you want both on the quickest safe timeframe."
12880,I’ll take it!
12881,"Not being partisan with this comment, but a lot of the rollout infrastructure was in place before Biden, the supply just took a while to get going."
12882,"Where I live, most everyone I know has gotten the vaccine from local county or state-organized facilities, not federal sites."
12883,"I don't think Biden flipped any magic switch and increased supply, it took time to build that and it coincidentally starting ramping up in the period around/after the election and inauguration."
12884,"Don't bother, he's just trolling."
12885,Pretty sure he is actually too stupid to understand though.
12886,He was claiming he's got better reflexes than a fly in another thread.
12887,Also said he never gets sick and hence needs no mask.
12888,[removed]
12889,Of course it's still safer to take the shot.
12890,But the vaccines did seem to cause the blood clots.
12891,This has been their conclusion.
12892,It's not coincidence
12893,[deleted]
12894,Do we know for sure that the vaccines caused the blood clots?
12895,If it’s causing one in a million type side effects I don’t think that’s really worth factoring in to the decision.
12896,Compare it to any number of activities including eating food and the risk is negligible.
12897,"Compare it to Covid, even if you’re young and healthy and it’s still much better to get vaccinated."
12898,I'm failing to see how this has anything to do with politicians?
12899,I knew funds were being collected publicly.
12900,The comment mentioned that taxes were being used.
12901,Hence the shock.
12902,Ask your doctor.
12903,I decided to skip the first dose as well.
12904,Demand is way down.
12905,"Our largest site here in Orlando, FL is doing its last ""first dose"" today, and closing at the end of the month."
12906,"I drove through for my 2nd shot last week and didn't even wait, just pulled right into one of the 20+ vaccine parking spots."
12907,Lots of access to it everywhere.
12908,"I just read the county is even offering to come to workplaces or home ""vaccine"" parties."
12909,"Seems like they don't have demand anymore and are trying to find creative ways to reduce any and all barriers however minor, to people's access."
12910,The only thing preventing people from getting it now are a.)
12911,laziness or b.)
12912,choice not to get it.
12913,"While this may seem like news, don’t let the photo fool you."
12914,"Atlanta Motor Speedway hasn’t sold out a race in damn near a decade, and this is the first time they’ve had a July race."
12915,"Think about it for a second, even if you’re vaccinated, how enjoyable is it to go to a race in Georgia at 3:00 in the afternoon in July."
12916,It’ll probably be 105 degrees lol.
12917,All of the countries you mentioned have already confirmed that they'll send you excess supply to poorer countries.
12918,At least if you have to push a misleading political point try to use facts.
12919,Definitely for the food.
12920,🌮
12921,"I mean ""wear a mask, stay in"" seems like the easiest thing to do in the world..."
12922,It becomes a level of risk society was comfortable with pre-pandemic.

12924,Depends when you go it.
12925,"Not supposed to go if you’ve recently had covid, within 21 days or something like that"
12926,How does that work?
12927,"You vaccinate one group, the elderly."
12928,"Then the remaining group, the younger but unvaccinated group, sees a rise in hospitalizations due to severe illness?"
12929,"When lockdowns and masks were not prevalent, and every single group in society had the same exposure to the virus, why weren’t they seeing younger people in ICUs?"
12930,"There were reports of younger people in ICUs, yes, but they were clearly outliers."
12931,Now they are seeing an increase?
12932,What leads to this?
12933,Genuinely interested.
12934,"And rural America has fewer, less staffed and less equipped hospitals."
12935,"After battling stupidity all year, just let them get sick."
12936,"Die, long term health issues or maybe they will be fine."
12937,I’m familiar with rural healthcare so good luck to them.
12938,"So what I’m saying to you, is what do you expect people on this forum to give you?"
12939,Here I’ll give it to you: uhhhh we’ll come up with a super vaccine that cures everything!!
12940,!
12941,I would predict mid-late summer-early fall.
12942,I'm in a state that is taking a really cautious approach though.
12943,Youth sports and kids can’t get vaccinated.
12944,No surprise.
12945,About 75%+ of the 65+ age group in MI is vaccinated while those under 30 is only about 20-25%.
12946,What's up with those funky dots?
12947,"Those are regular decimal separators, right?"
12948,We're using Pfizer and are basically vaccinating as fast as Moderna/BioNTech/Janssen can supply us.
12949,They could have killed many more if AZ actually had serious issues and they didn’t pause it to investigate.
12950,This is such a dumb take.
12951,I thought we were pro science?
12952,That was science in action.
12953,None of them are fully resistant.
12954,That’s not my point.
12955,Those variants that are starting to engage in vaccine-escape will keep mutating.
12956,Mutations will keep stacking and those that already have some vaccine-escape mutations will produce variants that have *more* of those.
12957,"Hmmmm I don’t know, maybe it’s because they wouldn’t vaccinate that age group at first."
12958,Just my opinion though...
12959,"Don’t worry, to make up for it I lied and got a 3rd dose."
12960,What sucks is that its mostly  a PR issue rather than a science backed decision.
12961,If people really assessed risk in daily life in this fashion nobody could afford insurance
12962,Tell me which variant doesn’t work with the vaccine at all.
12963,"Please, that’s all im asking."
12964,What makes you think politicians won't remove restrictions?
12965,If they didn't it would probably hurt their re-election chances
12966,[removed]
12967,It’s not a hypothetical if it’s already happening.
12968,"Just like the Super Bowl

Just like Wrestlemania

Just like the Texas Rangers operating at full capacity to start the season

Just like the Masters    /s"
12969,[deleted]
12970,China has a totalitarian government where people tolerate extreme suppression measures.
12971,"In early 2020, the virus had not evolved to be as adapted to human transmission yet either."
12972,Neither of these are true today in India
12973,"Yes, I think you’re right."
12974,"Looking at vaccination rates, 1 month ago it was 75% of seniors in the USA (Forbes, 3rd apr) and 55% had had both doses."
12975,"Cases a month ago were about 1/4 of USA peak so naively I’d assume deaths would fall from 4000 to 1000 by now, &lt;without any&gt; vaccination."
12976,So 800 does seem high given how many have been vaccinated.
12977,"Looking at the U.K., we have almost complete vaccine cover for seniors but only 1 dose for most by last month."
12978,"Cases have fallen 96% (mostly due to lockdown) and deaths 98% so deaths/cases have halved, and that’s only one dose."
12979,"(Plus there’s a lag factor I haven’t accounted for here as cases have fallen again in the last month, it’s probably nearer a third)

My guess is that the 25% of American seniors who hadn’t had one shot by last month are more at risk than the average senior."
12980,So the fall isn’t as dramatic as it should be imo.
12981,"Tldr; yes, I agree that the fall should be greater, given that 75% of seniors had 1 jag a month ago, and comparing to the U.K."
12982,"No it's not, the persistence of our corrupt government not introducing therapeutic drugs like Ivermectin in the early stages of infection is."
12983,"Many people are just being stupid about it, but some people with claustrophobia or anxiety really do struggle with it despite their best efforts"
12984,Most of the country is in good or great shape.
12985,"Only a few states have had serious outbreaks recently, Michigan being the most serious in the last few months."
12986,"Its outbreak started while vaccination was still ramping up, and was driven by communities more reluctant to get vaccinated or abide by masking/social distancing."
12987,"Vaccines seem wildly successful, beyond what most epidemiologists hoped for."
12988,"The data so far suggests that once people are vaccinated, covid becomes less dangerous than the flu."
12989,"It won't be 4 months for the people getting vaccinated later like the general younger population, but the people who first got it I bet will be towards the 4 month mark when they get the second."
12990,There's way less people alive who are over 80 than under 40
12991,Unsanitary facilities and the vaccine is overall dogshit IMO just a complete shitshow with J&amp;J
12992,"I applaud you,  and I'm vaccinated,  but it's not the finish line."
12993,The rest of the world is on fire right now.
12994,How the US helps them will define how long this thing lasts.
12995,And we still don't know how long immunity will last.
12996,And then we still have to deal with the CCP lying to everyone about it.
12997,This is still years from over.
12998,"I'm no statistician, but that could well be because all those over 80 have already died of, or have been vaccinated against COVID... Get what I mean?"
12999,That's correct.
13000,Doesn't change the fact that young people aren't getting vaccinated as much.
13001,"Sputnik is the one doing different adenovirus vectors between the two doses, but they both express the same spike protein."
13002,That makes no sense to me at all (regarding the first shot not protecting against variants but the second shot somehow does)
13003,"Now that you mention it, Guru Covfefe does look a little familiar..."
13004,"If you don't want to get the vaccine, get in the sea, just sink to the bottom of it."
13005,"Lead  Paragraphs:

 

Russia recorded more than 400,000 excess deaths from last April to this March during the COVID-19 pandemic, according to Reuters calculations based on data from the state statistics agency published on Friday."
13006,"Excess death figures, which some epidemiologists say are the best way to measure the true toll from COVID-19 given that counting methods vary between countries, surpass official COVID-19 death figures in many countries."
13007,Excess deaths are typically defined as the difference between the observed numbers of deaths in specific time periods and expected numbers of deaths in the same time periods.
13008,"Rosstat, the statistics agency, said Russia recorded around 250,000 deaths related to COVID-19 from last April to this March."
13009,"There’s not more young people than before, there’s less old people."
13010,It means the vaccine is working.
13011,Good fucking point.
13012,I think it was obvious I meant no long-term **deleterious** effects from vaccines?
13013,Help Canada first.
13014,We should not be saving cartels.
13015,How open is Michigan right now?
13016,"I’m in Ontario and we’re seeing a similar wave, with about 30% of people having 1 dose and 60-70% of seniors having 1."
13017,However case rates are around 4K a day despite tons of restrictions.
13018,[removed]
13019,Maybe.
13020,"I know colleges are requiring it so it’s going to court for them anyway, I’m sure some anti-vaxxers will sue."

13024,[removed]
13025,Time for divorce
13026,Thanks.
13027,But that article indicates that the data for non-specific effects is not solid and we should study it more.

13044,So natural immunity isn’t forever in this case.
13045,There is a risk but I think we have to qualify that statement if we want to be taken seriously.
13046,People in the 20-25 age group are about six times more likely to die in a car accident as they are from covid and people in the 50-54 age group are as likely to die in a car accident as they are of covid.

13052,Scientists have said water is in fact nothing but wet dihydrogen monoxide.
13053,[removed]
13054,This one data point is not going to change the fact that Covid is not that big of a threat to under 20s.
13055,That should not be the argument for young people taking the vaccine.
13056,"The argument should be about societal benefit, which is very valid."
13057,Don't use anecdotal evidence or stats misrepresentation to make covid look like a bigger threat to young people than it actually is.
13058,Telling the truth is not hard.

13063,1600 people in the one village and it's killed at least 50.
13064,That's what COVID looks like without hospital care.
13065,Some people are saying that after the vaccination there will be shedding of minute fragments of the spike protein which may or may not affect those non-poked people.
13066,"Here's the thing, the majority of Americans of any age group are overweight/obese."
13067,That right there is a co morbidity with Covid-19.
13068,"Just because people are young, doesn't make them healthy, especially not in this country."
13069,It says 92% 14 days after the first dose unless I’m reading that wrong.
13070,Oh yeah definitely.
13071,After they felt me up real good I couldn't find my backpack.
13072,Come to find out they were searching it.
13073,The look of disappointment they had when they found out I put some souvenir shot glasses and not water in my yeti was hilarious.

13081,Same.
13082,Disagree.
13083,"According to new reports, something like 1/3 of all Americans have had Covid."
13084,"Because of this natural immunity, Dr. Jha believes that we need another 10-15% of Americans to get vaccinated before we reach some sort of herd immunity (he said this on CNN or MSNBC -- can't remember which)  We are almost there."
13085,This vaccine is the only option left.
13086,No political will to lock down again and half the politicians don’t even want to wear masks.
13087,It’s all or nothing and looking like the USA will trip at finish line
13088,"It’s like nationalist leaders don’t care about their own people and country, but more so creating a platform around “us” and hating “them.” Weird."
13089,Who would have guessed?
13090,!

13105,*
13106,Right.
13107,So you want to compare to the US when it’s favorable and don’t want to when it’s not favorable.
13108,"We have to be #1 in everything, right?"
13109,"Were almost #1 in stupidity, too."
13110,I’m sure a lot of Reddit weirdos will
13111,"You also have no COVID and full sports stadiums, concerts, restaurants etc."
13112,We haven't been able to step foot in any of those places for over a year.
13113,As much as I hate masks if I had a choice I'd take wearing one over getting a reach around from tsa 10 x outta 10.

13126,I've never seen anything like that.
13127,A much safer bet a year ago when no vaccine existed and half the country hadn't already been infected.
13128,It would be one thing if they wanted to keep it in terminals with international arrivals.
13129,"But if we have doubts about arrivals beyond that point, then they shouldn't be getting past customs."

13132,correct.
13133,"they could make an appointment for the day after their Isolation ends though, as long as they aren't sick, and not taking any medication in the last 24 hours of Isolation."
13134,Because our conservative party decided it wasn't worth the money and got rid of our domestic production when they were in power.
13135,The liberal party now is working on reintroducing domestic ppe and medicine production so hopefully this won't be an issue going forward.
13136,I received a moderna and they threw out a j&amp;j
13137,Hell no
13138,A politician over there literally said drinking horse piss will cure Covid.
13139,It's a battle to Out-Modi Trump!
13140,Can you say bleach?
13141,You’ll get there.
13142,I had a lot of anxiety first when I was going to restaurants like more than my in laws in their late 50’s.
13143,By like the fourth or fifth time it just became normal again.
13144,Start small.
13145,Go to stores on off hours.
13146,Eat outside if you can and just build yourself up.
13147,A good way to calm yourself is to estimate the high end risk of infection.
13148,Take number of cases in your state.
13149,Multiply by 2 for unreported cases and multiply by 10 for days where they are infectious (this over estimates because most people aren’t infectious that long and a good percent probably won’t be out and about).
13150,Divide this by state population and multiply by 100 which is your odds of any person in public having covid.
13151,Now take the context your in like say restaurant capacity and multiply by number of people there.
13152,Then you can assume probably about a 20 percent attack rate and 95 percent efficacy which means you should divide that risk by 5 and 20.
13153,So for example in NJ right now.
13154,2000 cases daily.
13155,Multiply by 2 so 4000 cases daily accounting for unreported/untested.
13156,"Multiply by 10 day window of infectiousness so 40,000 cases daily."
13157,I think it’s fair to assume at least half the people will be home and you could probably assume even higher but let’s estimate worse case scenario.
13158,"That’s 20,000 people out 9 million or about 0.2 percent."
13159,Now lets say in a midsized restaurant there are 100 people but people actually reasonably close to you are probably closer to like 20.
13160,So 0.2 percent multiplied by 20 is 4 percent.
13161,But there is only about a 20 percent attack rate so that 4 percent drops to 0.8 percent and then 95 percent efficacy means it drops 0.04% chance of contracting covid for most restaurant experiences.
13162,Keep in mind too I way overestimated this risk.
13163,Like on average more than 50 percent of people will naturally be at home and a lot of those people will be quarantined because they tested positive or they’re not feeling good.
13164,"Also, in a reduced capacity restaraunt it’s possible you have even less people than that around you."
13165,"Lastly, NJ has one of the highest case rates in the country and the risk is still pretty low at sub 0.1 % chance and even if you catch it if you’re not high risk you’ll most likely be alright."
13166,"It is a good thing, except to the extent that more people under 40 being hospitalized with covid is attributable to them listening to meatheads like Joe Rogan."
13167,What a strange headline.
13168,"From what I can tell, &lt;40 hospitalizations exceed &gt;80 hospitalizations in just about every state."
13169,16 minutes ago you said it was Johnson and Johnson.
13170,Which is it?
13171,I smell bullshit.
13172,The risk of long term effects with the vaccine is better than contracting the virus itself
13173,That's the ideal situation.
13174,Unfortunately we don't have enough vigorous scientific proof to say that this is the case just yet.
13175,"My America-centric prediction: A few states will adopt vaccine passports, and require them to enter restaurants, bars, concerts, etc."
13176,"Initially, other states will resist that idea, but as more and more states adopt it and the residents of those states want to go to other states for whatever reason, most other states will adopt them."
13177,I think it’s mixed news.
13178,"On the one hand, it indicates that vaccines are working and protecting the elderly from covid and the variant."
13179,"On the other hand, it probably also indicates that the variant is getting super out of hand in Michigan, since that’s the one that affects young people."
13180,"That’s bad news since it is  more contagious, more deadly, and affects people of all ages, including kids, who can’t get the vaccine yet"
13181,[removed]
13182,Exactly.
13183,"It’s like this guy has always been a pseudo intellectual, mixing scientific truth with conspiracy."
13184,It’s just enough that he can hook credulous young males who otherwise respect the truth.
13185,The guy has been espousing conspiracy theories for well over a decade.
13186,"The change is that people who never found him to be intelligent and well informed are now informed about the bull shit he sells—long time fans have been forced to realize that, with many of those saying, “he’s fallen off,” or something even sillier: Spotify had something to do with it."
13187,No.
13188,You are just identifying the social pressure from people talking about how stupid he is.
13189,And why do you not have vaccine production?
13190,"That age bracket has a 99.98% survival rate, so I’d assume they’d rather risk getting Covid then get a shot that they aren’t 100% aware of the side effects yet."
13191,Perhaps you need some scare tactics to so that you can live forever.
13192,"Scaring people, destructing people mental heath to do what you want is very unethical."
13193,Toronto hot spot pop ups.

13196,"Jk here you go

https://www.nature.com/articles/nrd.2017.243"
13197,Honestly I don’t see this ever happening in any states.
13198,States should be focusing resources on getting the remaining 15-25% vaccinated to achieve herd immunity.
13199,I would assume that it means the monthly average across the entire pandemic until March 2021.
13200,"So the fact that case counts are higher for April than that average in every age group is bad, because it indicates that we’re currently in a spike, but I honestly don’t think it’s that informative outside of that fact."
13201,"Well, maybe because it does indicate that the difference above the mean is much larger for young people than the elderly."
13202,"What it does not show, although it seems like you think it might?"
13203,(I honestly can’t tell what point you’re trying to make here) is the case counts for each category for *last* March.
13204,"So there’s still no way to use the data they show us to make a direct comparison between the start of the pandemic and now - and notably, *the article never claims that they are trying to*."
13205,I'm not waiting.
13206,I'm never taking it.
13207,Good
13208,Yeah no one wants to talk about the fact that a longer interval is actually preferable in most vaccines.
13209,The only reason for the 3-4 week manufacturer's recommendation is because that was what was tested.
13210,It's fine if someone wishes to personally remain ignorant and to make up incorrect ideas out of nothing because they are only hurting themselves.
13211,"The problem comes when they go broadcast those incorrect ideas to a large audience who listen because ""they're funny"" and believe them."
13212,"Now you they hurting others, and that's not okay."
13213,It's possible that his anti vaccine stuff he spouts will result in someone dying who wouldn't have died if they hadn't listened to him.
13214,"Personally I believe it's inevitable, but there's no way to know for sure so I'll stop at the assertion it's possible."
13215,"If that happens, then his podcast existing has killed at least one person."
13216,"If it's likely to happen, then it's likely his podcast will kill people."
13217,For me that means his podcast shouldn't be allowed to continue for public safety reasons.
13218,It's akin to shouting fire in a theatre when there isn't one.
13219,"Free speech isn't unqualified, there are limits, and one of those limits is public safety."
13220,That remaining 26% https://i.imgur.com/e7wRTp8.jpg
13221,"Well for context, outdoor non-contact sport (which soccer is, isn't?)"
13222,"is being allowed for groups of 15 in Ireland in June, when we'll have about 40% of people vaccinated."
13223,"We have the most cautious approach to reopening in the world, so if it's safe here, it should be there as well where vaccination rates are higher."
13224,"Although our cases are a fair bit lower than the US as a whole, so maybe take in the prevalence in your community into account as well."
13225,How?
13226,There's been many studies done that don't link major outbreaks to gyms so long as people wear their mask.
13227,My gym is super anal about the mask thing and has been for a whole year now.
13228,"Plus not to mention, people in gyms tend to be healthier people and healthier tends to mean stronger immune system."
13229,I can think of MANY places that are magnitudes worse than a gym for COVID spread.

13257,"No, their positivity rate was always high they pretended it wasn't an issue"

13261,"Actually, this is not surprising to me regarding the fact that India is still a developing country."
13262,So a second wave is predictable and is likely to be more severe than other developed countries.
13263,"More interestingly, many people have the impression that India and China are similar as they are both developing countries with 1.3+ billion population."
13264,"But the reality is, sadly, that India is far behind China in almost all aspects."
13265,"

13303,Even the WHO stated that they had misgiving about outright bans on international travel because the impact on developing countries would lead to hunger &amp; disease &amp; collapse of their medical infrastructure.
13304,That's because he'd be listening to the actual experts.
13305,It's one thing to go to a mechanic and have the mechanic tell you a problem and you then tell other people that experience similar problems with their car what the mechanic told you.

13313,Investigating whether there were serious issues was certainly a scientific undertaking.
13314,Deciding to suspend use of the vaccine for that period was a decision of public health policy based on an uncertain situation.
13315,The precautionary principle is not a scientific statement.
13316,"&gt;It's common in Asia to wear a mask, it'll become commonplace in the West now

Hell no."

13318,Except when the advice is in line with the advice of medical professionals.
13319,And that's the personal choice that I think everyone should have.
13320,If people want to get a vaccine all the more power to them.
13321,At this point nearly all Americans have been offered an opportunity to receive a vaccine series.
13322,Subsequently all venues should be reopened at full capacity without restrictions.
13323,Those who were vaccinated according to our current science have little to nothing to worry about.

13327,Who brought up mask refusal?
13328,I think that would actually be a misrepresentation in the opposite direction in this case.
13329,One of the most troubling elements of the Michigan outbreak has been the much higher rate of hospitalization among the young.
13330,It's been a part of virtually every story I've read about it.
13331,"Sure, all the over 80's should have had their shots by now - specially the nursing home folk."

13336,This is not the same virus that it was when it first came around in December.
13337,"It has mutated and adapted and become much more lethal, and that is a main reason we are seeing more young people in hospitals."
13338,"Yea, absolutely younger people not getting vaccinated is another factor, but people here seem to be completely disregarding the fact that this virus has changed."
13339,"In Brazil where not as many elderly have been vaxxed as the US, younger and younger people are dying and being hospitalized for COVID."

13350,All you need to know is basic science and germ theory to understand that you can get the virus and transmit it in-between PCR tests.
13351,That's literally all you need to know.
13352,"For all you know, the next test you take could be positive."
13353,And you won't know how many people you might have exposed in the meantime.
13354,"None of that excuses not doing everything you can to protect those around you, including getting the vaccine."
13355,None of that changes the fact that people like you are making the vaccine less effective by making it impossible to achieve the protection offered by herd immunity.
13356,"It can be both, as cases are steadily declining due to immunity from the vaccine we’re seeing an easing of the restrictions which also signal sort of the “social end”, where states open up to full capacity and mask mandates start dropping."
13357,We’ve seen week over week decreases in cases for the past 2 consecutive weeks and that trend is locked in as we have a large amount of immunity from vaccines and some level from natural infection.
13358,"I was just saying that Memorial Day would be a good ""social end"" to a large part of the pandemic in a majority of the United States as businesses will be open full capacity and mask mandates in cities will be eased and then fully removed as time continues."
13359,It's also a good symbolic marker as it's basically the unofficial start to summer.

13361,This is wrong.
13362,Why do you think nurses treating coronavirus patients wear masks?

13366,How do you feel about Sputnik V?
13367,Keep wearing your masks esp if you’re not fully vaccinated yet.
13368,Don’t skip that second dose.
13369,Yep.

13374,&gt; Have vaccines been successful in reducing the severity of infection?
13375,"Yes and on top of that, even if you've recovered from Covid the vaccine can help get rid of the lingering side effects like loss of taste."
13376,We've seen some evidence of it in this very pandemic.
13377,"Research suggests that the new COVID variants are both more contagious and have a higher case fatality rate:

13380,They have no plans to remove masks.
13381,They *say* they'll follow all state-wide mandates and drop the county-specific ones when the county is 50% fully-vaccinated.
13382,"If I were a betting man, I would place money on them reinstating an indoor mask-mandate once my state drops the statewide indoor mask-mandate."

13401,"Airports, particularly international ones are a good place to enforce a hard line."
13402,I think vaccinations should be required for international air travel by then personally.
13403,Masks are a good start though.
13404,Well this demographic is the one going around without a mask and refusing to get vaccinated.
13405,So in general this is going to be a bad idea.

13410,I picked up strep while traveling once and was out of commission with a 103F fever for nearly a week.

13442,"If it's the case however that the infection is spreading rapidly among you people while the ratio of hospitalizations is staying the same than that means there may be a huge number of people getting asymptomatic spread, which could also be good for herd immunity although at the expense of some number of unlucky and unhealthy younger individuals."

13470,"One thing I'm wondering about: at the beginning of the vaccination campaign -- when public health officials were saying ""we don't know if vaccines prevent transmission!"""
13471,-- how likely was that to be true?
13472,"I get that public health messaging is hard, but I still see people claim that (even though it's pretty clear by now that it prevents transmission) and I can't help but wonder if it has fed into some vaccine skepticism."
13473,"When they were saying it, was there a real possibility of it being true?"
13474,"Or was it a ""theoretically possible but extremely unlikely"" sort of thing -- in which case I really question that messaging decision?"
13475,I might just never stop wearing it.
13476,"Firstly because I don’t have to ingest other people’s filth anymore, and secondly because it upsets the exact right sort of people I want to upset."
13477,We need to get everyone vaccinated before this develops a variant which slams kids.

13490,"I’ve seen dudes walk out of the stall and not wash their hands, and go back to lifting, pre-Covid."
13491,You’re an idiot if you think you’re fine during a pandemic to lift without a mask or vaccine.
13492,This is a giant mood.
13493,"I’ve been doing a few things that one “shouldn’t” over the pst year, but they always came with some anxiety for a few days after."
13494,"Now I’m fully vaccinated, I’m definitely doing things more (and realizing how much money I spent pre-pandemic on “doing things”) but that anxiety still presents itself."

13498,Mask wearing was lifted today for all of Johnson county Kansas!
13499,There was a covid vaccine shortage from the very first day of this pandemic.
13500,We can’t wave a magic wand and make 7 billion covid vaccine doses appear.
13501,The countries who developed and paid for their vaccines should get them first.
13502,"The number of young people being hospitalized is going down, and the number of old people went down even more."
13503,Because old people got vaccinated earlier.
13504,I saw that.
13505,It is great news.
13506,&gt; Honestly I don’t see this ever happening in any states.
13507,"My guess is the only places that try to do it are individual cities and counties, and maybe Hawaii (which makes sense)."
13508,India in this case does already have its own highly effective vaccine that it’s mass-producing
13509,This is actually excellent news with an intentionally scary headline to generate ad rev.
13510,"Considering that the hospitalization rate was already incredibly low before the vaccine, it’s now evident that the hospitalization rate for people over 80, a rate traditionally much much higher than for those under 40, now seems to be *less* than that."
13511,"You cant even trust medical professionals,  medical malpractice kills 250k a year in usa"
13512,Like what?
13513,Any examples?
13514,"It would likely be a variety of factors including where a country is in its epi curve, susceptibility of the population, socioeconomic stress etc."
13515,That's just off the top of my head; I'm sure global health experts can come up with a much more comprehensive system of variables based on which vaccine supply can be allocated.
13516,The research and production themselves are much more globally coordinated efforts than people believe on this thread.
13517,"But yes, a country's involvement in R&amp;D can be one factor among a large group of variables in determining supply."
13518,"Also, it's in the *self*\-interest of high-income countries to ensure this equitable distribution to tackle this pandemic in a globally coordinated manner; those mutant strains in India, South Africa, Latin America can just as easily spread in wreak havoc in high-income countries."
13519,Using your logic we should be calling every flu case the Spanish flu as that is what it was called 100 years ago?

13540,"All fine, you take your vax and mask."
13541,Dont complain if you get sick
13542,"No, but I can qualify it."
13543,"It's pretty easy to do if you know even the bare minimum about vaccines, which I know you do, which makes it extra pathetic that you're playing dumb here."
13544,"The risk of your transmitting it to others while unvaccinated is much, much higher than your risk of transmitting it if you were vaccinated."
13545,I hope I don’t get downvoted for this but has there been any updates on the India variant and the effectiveness on that as well.
13546,"""supplements"".. you mean steroids."

13551,There seem to be plenty of people in India who have been vaccinated with AZ but are still getting infected and put in hospital.
13552,This is not the case with India’s own Bharat Biotech vaccine
13553,There's selection pressure to make it more virulent and contagious.
13554,That can lead to a deadlier virus as long as it has a long asymptomatic contagious period.

13630,"[Here’s what to do if you get covid-19 between vaccine doses](https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/2021/04/30/covid-infection-between-doses/)

&gt;	Health experts said that people who contract covid-19 in the middle of their vaccine series should still get the second dose, because the immune response from natural infection is so variable."
13631,"But depending on when in the process individuals get sick, they may need to postpone it."
13632,&gt;	The CDC recommends that people with mild to moderate infection isolate for at least 10 days after the onset of symptoms or until they have recovered and at least 24 hours after being fever-free.
13633,"&gt;So those who get covid-19 within the first week or so after their first dose may be fine to get the second dose on time, assuming they have complied with the recommendations."
13634,The second dose of the mRNA vaccines is supposed to be given 21 days after the first dose for Pfizer and 28 days for Moderna.

13667,"Secondly, the bulk of the citations and evidence are of very different situations."
13668,"The Ebola outbreak had 28,000 cases in West Africa over two years, so yeah, using ring vaccination on outlying villages is viable, the risk of mutation is low with so few cases."

13678,"It's a good thing, if it's only due to there being less older people getting sick."
13679,There have been some studies suggesting that the new variants are more dangerous to younger people.
13680,I saw one out of brazil a few weeks ago finding that people under 40 with no pre-existing conditions were 5-7 times more likely to be hospitalized from covid infections in February compared to November.
13681,If we start seeing increased hospitalizations of younger people because we have variants that are making them sicker that would not be a good thing.

13945,I get my flu-shot every year.
13946,"In just a few weeks, most, if not all, people in Ontario ages 18 and over can get vaccinated with Pifzer/Moderna through the government booking system."
13947,I got some comment downvoted badly and removed in my local subreddit for asking what vaccine was being offered at a mobile hotspot.
13948,I'm in my 20s and would prefer not to get AstraZeneca.
13949,People said that I could be slowing down the vaccine rollout.
13950,"But in Ontario, the plan was already determined at the start of the rollout and hasn't slowed down -- it has actually sped up not just due to demand, but also due to increase supply of Pfizer."
13951,"I don't want to downplay the seriousness of COVID-19, but if the pandemic was more urgent, and if it wasn't that safe to just stay at home, I would certainly be more inclined to take whatever vaccine is available."
13952,The option to wait a few weeks for a more widely used vaccine just doesn't seem so bad to me.
13953,"I can't find much discussion about vaccine shopping online, especially outside of Canada."
13954,"So, is it really that bad to 'vaccine shop'?"
13955,What does the doctor's sexual preference have to do with any of this ?
13956,The article says 40% of adults have received at least one shot.
13957,I thought the national average was closer to 50.
13958,the Golden State wasn't looking so Golden during the Winter Surge.
13959,LA had a positivity rate over 20%!
13960,And whole neighborhoods had every other household with a member catching covid.
13961,And in the midst of this all this sickeness &amp; death shopping malls and retailers were fully open because it was easier to scapegoat restaurants &amp; gyms.
13962,"We could've done so much better, especially in terms of protecting black &amp; brown communities who can't work from home."
13963,"Wait, I'm confused."
13964,He got sick and then he got better so what was the problem?
13965,None of the variants are resistant to the vaccine.
13966,Stop fear mongering.

13968,There weren’t 30k influenza deaths **last year**.
13969,Why?
13970,Because the social distancing measures that barely held COVID-19 below 600k deaths in a year virtually eliminated flu deaths.
13971,Its asinine to compare the two diseases at this point.
13972,It's literally Biontech's Phase 3 study.
13973,"The abstract includes the most relevant information, in this case (Phase 3 study) the fact that Biontech is efficient at preventing Covid without too many observed side effects."
13974,The vaccines were rolled out in accordance with the study parameters defined and reported by Biontech - including the spacing between the two shots.
13975,Are you suggesting governments should completely disregard the manufacturers of a vaccine and invent their own parameters as to how vaccines should be administered?
13976,This x100.
13977,Only reason there is a surge in Oregon while cases are dropping in NYC is that we probably have 4x the amount of prior infection per capita here.
13978,hmm none of the people hospitalized in my county (Oregon) are under 30 and they make up 54% of cases
13979,the cdc having bad messaging on vaccines is the reason you see the 2nd quote so much
13980,I'm talking about the entire pandemic.
13981,Compare CA to FL and TX and then consider the difference in restrictions with masks and closing businesses.
13982,We know there are ebbs and flows and the virus rates go very low after a large wave.
13983,Remember NY in may 2020?
13984,"I’d be willing to bet that most, if not all, establishments in DC will still require masks, even if vaccinated."
13985,"But hopefully there’s some further clarity coming out of the mayor’s office soon, since this kinda dropped out of nowhere."
13986,"on the other side there might be deaths that would normally be prevented, like scheduled operation etc (which didn't happen since health care was limited to covid-19 almost exclusively)"
13987,"Ok thank god you’re joking, you had me for a second lol"
13988,"Anybody know if there’s like... anything you can do about someone who has tested positive for covid, is actively infected, but is still wandering around in public, going out partying, ignoring mask mandates?"
13989,It’s not in my nature to be a narc but they spend a lot of time around elderly people and someone could very easily die and it worries me.
13990,One thing the pandemic made clear is how ridiculously ignorant people are in statistics
13991,Russia can't afford vr sooo... Because they're not the greatest country on earth.
13992,"They will invade in the real world that we live in and not a phony world, let that sink in... Ronald reagan watched tv and was on tv and he wasn't a loser so tv isn't dangerous."
13993,Plus I haven't seen any tv viewers shout the n bomb at their tv screens and they don't beat their wives as often as gamers do.
13994,Corona and populism is a marriage made in hell.
13995,Good news for Brazil!
13996,I got covid last week from work.
13997,Masked up and was sitting 5 feet from the person who had it.
13998,Didn’t make any physical contact with him.
13999,No one was coughing or breathing hard.
14000,"If I can get it from that, you better be sure as hell people are spreading it at a gym where they are huffing and sharing equipment."
14001,Thankfully mine is asymptomatic.
14002,And yea I know for a fact I got it from him since I have been isolated besides that.
14003,[removed]
14004,[removed]
14005,But we're talking about wearing masks when walking through a restaurant.
14006,Why don't you think that makes sense?
14007,Honestly it sucks but it’s nothing.
14008,I had two down days but I still was able to go to classes and sports practice.
14009,Felt like crap but was still able to manage.
14010,&gt;I believe that psychologists must be looking at this and studying it in real time.
14011,Indeed: [https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/psychological-medicine/article/coronavirus-conspiracy-beliefs-in-the-germanspeaking-general-population-endorsement-rates-and-links-to-reasoning-biases-and-paranoia/1FD2558B531B95140C671DC0C05D5AD0](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/psychological-medicine/article/coronavirus-conspiracy-beliefs-in-the-germanspeaking-general-population-endorsement-rates-and-links-to-reasoning-biases-and-paranoia/1FD2558B531B95140C671DC0C05D5AD0)
14012,"He's very borderline, missed the boomer cut off by a few years."
14013,I think it’s so ridiculous the travel restrictions from India to US aren’t starting immediately.
14014,"What good is going to come of people from India coming to the US today, tomorrow and until these flight restrictions start?"
14015,The people of India are so willing to ignore guidelines that there were thousands of thousands of people crowded together for a religious ceremony.
14016,That’s disgusting.
14017,Also I’m tired of seeing people say Biden is ‘xenophobic’ for choosing to put these restrictions in place.
14018,Are you serious?
14019,"I live in NY, one of the hardest hit states."
14020,We *are* recovering but all of our progress will stop if we let people from India keep coming.
14021,I already feel hopeless for the rest of the world knowing what’s going on in India.
14022,I just hope we can all recover from this and stay safe.
14023,So tired of also seeing people turn this into a debate about left/right.
14024,So dumb.
14025,"Get over yourselves please, people are dying &lt;3"
14026,&gt; Michigan residents are returning on time for their second dose of COVID-19 vaccine at a better rate than the national average.
14027,"&gt; The two most widely used vaccines in the U.S. -- developed by Pfizer and Moderna -- require a second dose spaced 21 and 28 days apart, respectively."
14028,The second shot is necessary for maximum effectiveness against severe cases of COVID-19.
14029,"&gt; As of April 17, more than 95% of Michigan residents who received a first dose of the Pfizer vaccine and were eligible for a second dose had shown up for their follow-up appointment and gotten one, according to vaccine data from the state health department."
14030," &gt;The second dose is no joke

It **REALLY* varies from person to person."
14031,Many have no side effects whatsoever.
14032,Some have slight effects.
14033,"Some  have severe...

Would be great to see statistics by age group"
14034,Here in Vancouver we have a big Brazilian strain outbreak.
14035,So far the hospitalization rate (per 100 confirmed cases) is no higher among young people than the original Wuhan strain.
14036,Hospitalization rate is a bit higher for older cases.
14037,Young people are a higher % of admissions than they were previously due to the combo of more cases (more infectious) in young people and fewer in vaccinated older people.
14038,No evidence here so far that it’s more severe in young people than the original strain.
14039,My brother is 25.
14040,Had a sore throat for 4 days and was back to normal in less than a week.
14041,But have you talked to the 4 who died?
14042,They might have gotten better since you last saw them.
14043,The lethality of influenza varies greatly year to year.
14044,My point is just that no one should use 1 year of data as a representative.
14045,Turkmenistan has a strongman autocrat in charge which results in some ... poor governance.

14057,I live in a Oregon and appreciate the stance the governor has taken to reduce transmission.
14058,The high cases now are due to the younger crowd finally giving up and having large social gatherings.
14059,It’s been a long year of people being fairly dedicated to spread reduction.
14060,I’d die if I lived in a state where no one cares about others well-being!
14061,I mean there are charts on the likelyhood of different symptoms after your vaccination for Moderna and Pfizer.
14062,Moderna is around 40% chance of having fever and/or body aches.
14063,While Pfizer around 25% for those same symptoms.
14064,So millions are having a pretty shitty time after getting vaccinated especially after the second dose.
14065,"Weird, there were a whole bunch of covidiots over the last month who were shouting ""look how good Michigan is doing!"""
14066,but I can't seem to find any of them now.
14067,It's almost like they cherry pick their data and move on as soon as it's inconvenient to their dumb stupid opinions.
14068,The nut jobs are getting desperate.
14069,This is sad.
14070,"As an Italian, I feel you"
14071,"I use text to speech mostly, but I do like to cut through the bullshit with the truth, so thanks."
14072,Because their knee-jerk response is to distrust advice from any official source.
14073,Nationally Children (who can be vaccinated) and Adults refusing to get vaccinated total over 40% of the US population.
14074,COVID will keep spreading and so many more people will die in the next 5 months.
14075,My kickboxing gym just said fuck it and never did masks ever.
