0,I've a little personal story to relate to this.
1,"A previously employer once had a drug rehab in the middle of nowhere, small desert town where everyone knew everyone."
2,At first they weren't getting any business despite court orders etc and that's because they had their own parking lot and anybody who saw your car there would know you're in treatment.
3,So eventually they moved and shared a parking lot with a medical building and they finally got the clients they needed.
4,The moral of the story- make it discrete.
5,"Humans are weird and in small towns like that, discretion is a part of life."
6,Well CRAP!
7,It is trailing Delta and Gamma right now...
8,The reputable source is ptowns reputation
9,"Sex, drugs, rock n roll"
10,Ok i get the jokes but holy shit why arent people more alarmed??
11,I’ve never seen a virus take away your sense of smell and taste and now cognitive ability.
12,And with how contagious this is it just seems like something insane
13,Same here!
14,"It's 2021, we have a smartphone in everyone's pockets and there should have been a national database where everyone's vaccination records get uploaded to with a scannable QR code!"
15,"Lockdown is a government response, not a community one."
16,"The government is jerking us around, even if we vaccinate everyone, people in other continents won’t."
17,What’s your end game?
18,"Put us under house arrest, force people to get vaccinated, and then what?"
19,What do you actually believe your government will do?
20,"Declare it over and give up their addictive control, and release us back to normal life?"
21,Why?
22,"You’re thrashing your own people, but you need to consider policy."
23,"Is it really your citizens, or is it a government acting like a government?"
24,Way to go Alabama.
25,You’re number 1!
26,You do know that the research started 10 years ago for SARS I right ?
27,Read the prior comment.
28,The cdc said.
29,Not me.
30,"Not some random redditor
 

The cdc."
31,"So they want unbridled capitalism, govt just small enough to drown in the bathtub, and not to be told how to live their lives."
32,"But when a capitalist company wants to set their own rules, you want government to intervene and tell them how to run their companies."
33,I feel like I'm on crazy pills trying to wrap my brain around conservative logic.
34,Just wanted to update and say she did not make it sadly.
35,This is hard but a reminder that this long fight of covid is still not over and their is still a lot of work to be done.
36,Stay safe everyone.
37,"Apparently what the CDC is trying to really push in these upcoming days and weeks is vaccinations, which is a sign that they agree that we cant just uproot everyone's lives a second time and go back to pre-vaccine life."
38,"yes, anyone can."
39,Even a foreign tourist can without any US identities
40,&gt;They are mostly concerned about increased transmission from the delta variant.
41,That's precisely what most people here are saying?
42,People are saying that because this sub has been insistent that vaccines significantly reduce spread.
43,"If you don't believe me, go back to any thread about cities bringing back mask mandate in the past 2 weeks."
44,"Atlanta added one yesterday, not sure how many people will follow it though"
45,This is the latest info I have: https://www.jhsph.edu/covid-19/articles/covid-19-vaccines-and-immunocompromised-people-fully-vaccinated-and-not-protected.html
46,My rule of thumb this whole time has been anything over 7% is cause for concern.
47,My county in the US just reached that level again this week.
48,Exactly.
49,At some point enough is enough.
50,"I can only ""protect other people"" so much."
51,At this point people have made the clear choice they don't want the vaccine.
52,"It's free, available, easy, etc."
53,screw them.
54,If they get it they get it
55,Why bother then!
56,?
57,"no, they think it lkills you, they would like that."
58,Genocidal fucks
59,"They watch CNN, but only to rage at it."
60,"2 years behind vs. long term effects from covid, mental anguish from bringing it home to someone else in the family, or just death."
61,But sure... Let's send them back when we all know they shouldn't be there.
62,[removed]
63,"85% efficacy vs a virus with an R0 in the 5-10 range with ~50% vaccine rates is really, really not great."
64,"Not that herd immunity is the end all be all, but it's basically impossible to actually reach herd immunity with a vaccine that effective."
65,"You're basically almost entirely relying on the vaccine to protect you specifically at that point (assuming no other measures in place), and I don't know about you, I don't usually feel comfortable playing Russian roulette just because you don't die 83% of the time."
66,anyone in USA can get vaxxed regardless of status even a tourist who just waltzed in from anywhere on earth can
67,"Clearly the Washington Post doesn't care about posting information labeled ""confidential preliminary data."
68,"subject to change""."
69,What that says I'm not sure.
70,In any case its just a PowerPoint.
71,I found a few things interesting though.
72,1) The only new information is the references to surveillance data and information from the Massachusetts outbreak.
73,Without knowing more about the data (e.g.
74,"symptomatic versus asymptomatic), it's tough to know what to make of it."
75,I guess we'll find out more tomorrow.
76,2) They are still including the outlier Israelei about vaccine efficacy that hasn't replicated elsewhere.
77,3) Their graph showing the transmissibility of the Delta variant compared to the ancestral strain has what I assume are pretty wide error bars around the estimate for the Delta variant.
78,The axis showing fatality rate is also on the logarithmic scale ...
79,I wonder how many lay-people reading it will know how to interpret that.
80,4) Their modeling for incidence assumes 75% to 85% vaccine efficacy.
81,Masking is assumed to be 40 to 60% percent effective at preventing transmission to others and between 20 and 30% at protecting from infection .... bad news for unvaccinated kids crowded into schools if your really concerned about cases amongst those age groups.
82,They really need to make clear that masking only works at a population level.
83,I get the feeling that some individuals in populations skeptical of vaccines and the pharmaceutical industry might think masks offer more protection than they do.
84,"Vaccines are really the only to sure way, as sure you as you can be, of protecting yourself from severe COVID."
85,"5) The graphs reporting their models have four colors, but only three colors are defined in the key."
86,The meaning of that fourth color has pretty dramatic implications for how to interpret the models.
87,6) This clearly wasn't meant for public release.
88,"I'm not sure why the Washington Post published it, and I'm not sure what they expect non-specialists to take away from it."
89,"Even for specialists, without being in the room to ask questions, the PowerPoint is of limited value and doesn't offer much of anything new."
90,Republican Party is licking their lips
91,"Yes, let's cause a major inconvenience 99% planet for that 1%."
92,Let's ask those 99% to line up for hours and take time off work to go get tested.
93,Let's cripple the economy with lockdowns for that 1%.
94,I don't know about you but I live in a democratic country where the goal is to make the most people happy not everyone happy i.e.
95,"realistic &amp; practical goals

By the way I dont know many immunocompromised people that would work in sectors that wouldn't allow working from home."
96,In fact where I work have a few immunocompromised and elderly people and they have been fortunate enough to work from home for the entirety of the pandemic.
97,Also what did those immunocompromised people do in the years some nasty influenza strains were going around?
98,"Its up to your government to run programs for vulnerable people, putting the onus on the general population is the easy way out."
99,People with opinions like yours are what's letting the politicians off easy.
100,This analysis is a bit misleading.
101,"There are very many small hospitals that do not have COVID inpatients at all, they will send them to the larger regional systems."
102,"As an anecdotal reference, our current COVID-19 inpatient count is about 30% of our max last Nov/Dec."
103,"It's been hovering around there for about a week, but our positivity has been creeping up (14% if you don't count things like pre-procedure tests)."
104,I expect the inpatient count to probably increase from where we are but it is so very difficult to predict since you are essentially trying to predict human behavior and politics.
105,Also recommends wearing of masks regardless of vaccination status.
106,"https://services.aap.org/en/news-room/news-releases/aap/2021/american-academy-of-pediatrics-updates-recommendations-for-opening-schools-in-fall-2021/

*In updated guidance for the 2021-22 school year, the American Academy of Pediatrics strongly recommends in-person learning and urges all who are eligible to be vaccinated to protect against COVID-19."
107,"*


*In addition to vaccinations, the AAP recommends a layered approach to make school safe for all students, teachers and staff in the guidance here."
108,"That includes a recommendation that everyone older than age 2 wear masks, regardless of vaccination status."
109,"The AAP also amplifies the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s recommendations for building ventilation, testing, quarantining, cleaning and disinfection in the updated guidance."
110,*
111,I'm not surprised.
112,"So I saw these news in a portuguese discord server and a lot of (young) people there are saying they hope Portugal does the same and they might even hold back to get vaccinated now, they're delusional to the point they're hoping we don't reach herd immunity just so our government is forced to do the same."
113,This will never happen here (we're not rich) but the fact that your global influence might hold back vaccination in other countries because of your stupid ideas irks me.
114,Pro-disease Policy
115,They’re not going to get it even if the FDA approves it.
116,The goalpost will move just enough for them to say no
117,They're even lining things up w/ the Federal mandates that are about to be set down.
118,Biden has already called for Federal medical workers to get inoculated.
119,Corporations don't have the luxury of living in an anti-vaxx world.
120,"Too many people get sick, become chronically ill, or die of the newest variants and it's going to cascade into bigger problems."
121,"Experienced employees unable to fulfill their duties, junior employees either can't be hired due to their payroll needs and physical debilitation."
122,Not to mention the global impacts to supply chains which we really only got a taste of in the past year.
123,"Bulk hospitalizations will overtax the healthcare system in everything from uninsured people being unable to pay sky high costs, health care professionals leaving in droves due to seeing their colleagues die, again."
124,Foreclosures and evictions go up as industries can't keep up w/ the loss of manpower/supply chain issues.
125,"The majority of people started staying home of their own accord from restaurants, airports, movies, etc., if this hits the youth even harder that's going to go right back into effect."
126,Anti-vaxxers have painted themselves into a corner on this one.
127,"They've pushed the narrative so far, and for a period of time had the Head of State for the US backing them, right up until he himself succumbed to the disease in horrific fashion."
128,"True to form, they're starting to slowly get vaccinated themselves, but the fact that they're starting to do this in secret so as to avoid scandal in their own social circles has to be the craziest part of this whole thing."
129,"Yeah, was about to say, the big holdouts on the vaccine now are generally not the same people as those that would have to worry about immigration status."
130,At what point can we declare him a domestic terrorist?
131,"I just lost my aunt a few hours ago, due to covid."
132,Please everyone get vaccinated.
133,It's really not worth losing your life.
134,"She was the sweetest soul and I'm really, really going to miss her."
135,Fuck.
136,I just can’t sleep at night worrying about my unvaccinated kid
137,"The big rise was concentrated heavily in young people, a significant proportion of which had had at least 1 dose of a vaccine."
138,I got Covid after my first dose and it was really mild (21 years old).
139,"In the end, higher vaccination rates and maybe a new Push for medical reform?"
140,Do we trust vaccine cards though?
141,Haven't there been issues with people faking them?
142,I'm still so annoyed and frustrated there isn't a digital way to verify!
143,is anyone really surprised?
144,they have the lowest vaccination rate in the country.
145,They didn't even know the flu was a virus.
146,I would expect nothing less out of the Bible Belt.
147,"The lack of individual thought, the constant strive to twist everything that “Preacher Chuck” says as being biblical."
148,It’s insane.
149,I heard stores but when I visited and saw it first hand I was absolutely amazed.
150,“Sunday Service” is nothing more than a rock concert with an excuse to be rid of your kids for a few hours and socialize.
151,A good friend of mine lives in Tennessee and his “pastor” just tested positive for Covid.
152,"He’s still working at the church, still planning to do “service”."
153,The man is so crazy he honestly believes that by getting Covid he will now have a better immunity than if he took the vaccine.
154,"Last weeks sermon was all about “having faith in Jesus, not in masks”

The insanity is real so sadly this doesn’t surprise me one bit"
155,Lol

171,I bet it was political move and they were pressured to lift the mask mandate.
172,"Unfortunately, most people here don't know that data."
173,"In fact, the pinned post ""[Vaccines work and are safe](https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/oq2vtx/vaccines_work_and_are_safe/)""  still has the old info:

&gt;Vaccination and previous infection reduce viral load, which reduces spread."
174,Updated info here.
175,"&gt;  
&gt;This article does a good job of explaining the likelihood of vaccines at least reducing spread."
176,This suggests a great reduction in ability to spread the virus.
177,Maybe even with just one dose!
178,"The overall message of the pinned post is correct, but it has yet to be updated."
179,[removed]
180,"Yeah, temperature?"

185,Pffft.
186,"However, there will still be those who catch COVID, survive, and then still adamantly refuse to get vaccinated."
187,You might want to get a couple of N95 masks.
188,One to use at the venue and one to use for the flight.
189,Better safe than sorry and all that.
190,I have no idea why people are saying that either.
191,This thread is clearly overwhelmed people lashing out.
192,I don’t want to disregard the data but I do think people are slightly overreacting here.
193,Agreed... on every point.
194,In science you can make observational discoveries and then figure out why later.
195,You can also do the opposite.
196,Einstein had theories that we used for 100 years before we could observe them.
197,I have a feeling booster shots will be recommended very soon.
198,Maybe within the next month or so.
199,Criminally negligent and contributing to the suffering of the people of his state every day.
200,Recall and remove.
201,"With all the willfully unvaccinated, how will we be able to tell?"
202,"Your definition of ""worked"" is broken as fuck."
203,NY has way more deaths than Florida with less people and slightly more deaths than Texas also with less people.
204,And by population fatality rates New York is far worse than places like Germany and France.
205,So tell me again how well New York and their lack of enforcement has done.
206,"What a stupid example to bring up, thinking New York did well."
207,And apparently the lowest IQ's...
208,No.
209,We know there's tons of infection around.

216,"Medical bills is the best case scenario for them once their in a hospital bed, the alternative at that point is funeral costs."
217,"But you’re point is still valid, free vaccine is the significantly better choice."
218,"In bc, 60% of our cases are coming from an area with 16% of our population."
219,There’s the standard urban vs rural divide in terms of vaccination rates here… greater Vancouver and Vancouver island  is doing pretty good.
220,The smaller towns are not.
221,This passage doesn't have enough upvotes.
222,Well that’s terrifying
223,"Pretty sure they aren't getting that data from the random people getting vaccinated, mate."
224,They have controlled studies for that and these things take time.
225,It's not necessarily a useful statistic.
226,"Who gets tested varied significantly throughout the pandemic, and at this point Alabamians don't really care much about Covid, so you're probably only getting severely symptomatic patients tested, vs earlier in the pandemic when we tested everyone with the slightest sniffle."
227,"https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-58003893

We should."
228,Russia is botching Sputnik V. We have plenty of vaccine.
229,This seems like a no-brainer; we use these vaccines and interfere with Russian diplomacy.
230,"Plus, depending on whom we give the vaccines to, this may spur vaccinations due to FOMO."
231,and we have record number of resignations too.
232,People are quitting their low paying jobs for better ones.
233,We've (at least I have) been planning on getting annual boosters.
234,They should just bundle it with the new mRNA flu vaccine and everyone just gets annual boosters.
235,My work is implementing a mask mandate.
236,My supervisor flat out said he doesn't agree with it.
237,Praying for it.

246,It’s true we don’t know what the future holds but some of the things being said on this thread is just irresponsible and inaccurate.
247,Right now the data shows the vaccines as still being useful against infection.
248,All we can do is keep a lookout for future data.
249,I’m not the one moving any goalposts lol.

285,Need opinions.

287,which currently has an outbreak of delta and doesnt really look like slowing down.

291,Dont wanna wait 2-3 months unvaxxed if I know I could go get one tomorrow.
292,I asked our son's pediatrician because we couldn't find a test for my husband who was sick for a fee days (Florida) and she stated the Ellume ones were pretty accurate and due to the issue in Florida she recommended them.

298,I wonder how many voter base GOP is willing to literally sacrifice in their crusade against masking and vaccination.
299,I agree with you.
300,"I work in health care, out of the last 5 patients I tested for covid, 4 tested positive, and 3 of those were fully vaccinated."
301,We are having a lot of breakthrough infections at my clinic.
302,"One patient who tested positive, their only symptom was nasal congestion, nothing else."
303,"Most people who just have nasal congestion don't end up getting tested because they don't think they have covid, so they are out and about spreading it to others."
304,It is a problem.
305,"People who are vaccinated need to understand that most people fully vaccinated who have covid just have mild symptoms, but they need to get tested so they will know if it's covid and can isolate and slow the spread."
306,Unfortunately we have also had some test positive who are fully vaccinated and they ended up hospitalized.
307,They may have not survived if they hadn't been vaccinated.
308,"I don’t think most vaccines existed until the 1960s, except polio 1950, and small pox 1800s"
309,Covid poses higher risk of death as well.
310,And hospitalizations.
311,And being out on a ventilator.
312,Completely false to claim there is no protection from infection w/ the vaccines.
313,Anecdotes are not data nor do they counter the robust data we have demonstrating vaccine efficacy against this variant and others.
314,Delta is not an escape variant.
315,The vaccines are effective.
316,"Also, keep out of the hospitals silly gooses."
317,Lol nah.

If you believe we made a mistake, please [message the moderators](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=/r/Coronavirus&amp;subject=Removed submission&amp;message=I'm writing to you about the following submission: https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/otvlib/-/)."
339,"Well, I see your point."
340,"Especially as something mysterious seems to be happening now with viral load in vaccinated breakthrough cases, more data is better."
341,"""It's time for your abortion, Mr."
342,"Vandelay."""
343,So more than half the total population &amp; more than half the current death total.
344,"Oh, def not saying no risk."
345,Not even low risk.
346,Just lower when placed on a spectrum.
347,"Kids have already paid too high a price, and I am infuriated that they weren’t prioritized sooner."
348,I'm aware.
349,"I'm not saying I'm looking forward to getting infected, just saying that all the available data still looks like your outcome if you do get infected is WAY likely to be WAY better if you vaccinated."
350,"Still glad I'm vaccinated, would still get a booster shot if offered."
351,The vaccines are saving many lives.
352,Being vaccinated is a good thing.
353,Being vaccinated plus wearing masks is better.
354,Masks protect those around you.
355,"If everyone were masked, then there would be equal protection."
356,"Remember, in a surgical operating theater everyone is masked."
357,"Not to protect the staff from patient's germs, but to protect the patient from what they might exhale."
358,Nobody’s suggesting getting booster shots yet bro
359,Fast forward 2 months to this dude in icu fighting for his light against the damn democratic games 😐
360,[removed]
361,Anyone else going to get vaccinated a second time just for the $100?
362,My then girlfriend got the vaccine last May on a Wednesday.
363,"The first positive in the household was her mom’s antivax boyfriend who had a temp at work and was forced to get tested, then everyone else in household tested positive and had it too."
364,Guess who got blamed for giving it to them….
365,"The mom was an idiot too, she had to go the hospital for it and my girlfriend was asymptotic and offered to take her."
366,Instead she called the grandmother to take her who had both does but arrived with no mask to take her daughter to hospital.
367,She got it too.
368,Luckily no one died and all hospitalization was short term.
369,OP is full of shit.
370,"He made up his own title, and he’s blaming it on poor English."
371,The article title translated doesn’t say a single thing about any of the countries listed protesting.
372,"That’s not “poor English”, that is blatant editorializing."
373,I don’t know how this post has been up for 12 hours.
374,Good on your work to do that.
375,Kicking up such a fuss just for a vaccine jesus christ.
376,I don't regret being vaccinated but I never accepted the magical properties it was being given in the media.
377,"I'll continue to be as cautious as I can afford to be until I feel like doing otherwise, not when someone on the teevee says I don't have to."
378,"This is pretty fear mongering and poor journalism (but hey keeping us scared is a profit, right?)"
379,and I’m not 100% on board.
380,"How many people were in Provincetown, over Fourth of July!?"
381,"Like tens of thousands, have any of you seen that place in summer!"
382,800 cases.
383,In a very vaxxed state.
384,I don’t know that still sounds to me like the vaccine is working.
385,Especially someone knowing how crowded p town can get.
386,I'm going into my 3rd year and I'll begrudgingly take mask mandates (even though I'm vaccinated) if it means I get to actually be on campus.

414,How about lengthy covid ?
415,Yes indeed.
416,They're taking this all very seriously.
417,"Looking at the graph included in the article, what you are saying is correct."
418,"Per 100,000 people tested, there are 17 times as many unvaccinated people testing positive as compared to vaccinated people."
419,"But, how is it decided who gets tested?"
420,"If you just randomly selected people to get tested, then that's fair."
421,But people self-select to get tested based on symptoms and concerns over vaccination status and possible exposure.
422,"And, a healthcare worker will decide to test someone (or not) when showing up to a medical facility with a respiratory issue."
423,"Per CDC guidelines, vaccinated people were not recommended for testing if they had no symptoms."
424,"So if Connecticut was following CDC recommendations, you have a whole population of vaccinated people that are being selected out of testing just because they had no symptoms."
425,And we know that having the vaccine makes you less likely to have severe symptoms.
426,So this is the part that I'm wondering about: Are there a lot of unsymptomatic/mildly symptomatic vaccinated people that *would* have tested positive if they had been given the test.
427,"&gt;	The delta variant of the coronavirus appears to cause more severe illness than earlier variants and spreads as easily as chickenpox, according to an internal federal health document that argues officials must “acknowledge the war has changed.”

1000x the virus load that’s now known to be more deadly."
428,No data about long covid in fully vaccinated people.

449,"That's like saying Disney Land isn't in Los Angeles, sure it's technically true but no one's going to call you out on saying you went to LA and Disney Land."

457,"In the US, there are likely to be gunfights with law enforcement should a true lockdown be attempted."
458,"Certainly relatively few are bold enough to shoot it out with law enforcement, but there would certainly be some measure of bloodshed."
459,"There are not really many scenarios that could spin a positive light on government effectively inciting violence (certainly more so than letting the virus run unchecked), even if the violent folk are far right."
460,"I dare you...  No, I double-dog dare you!"
461,"They could have just kept doing what they were doing before, asking states for all positive tests."
462,They stopped requiring states to report data positive Covid on vaccinated unless they are hospitalized or die.
463,Everything short of hospitalization is not reflected in their numbers.
464,You still have to report all positive cases in unvaccinated people even if they are asymptomatic.
465,Document link: https://www.washingtonpost.com/context/cdc-breakthrough-infections/11fc6a11-20d7-466e-a654-c6bc8426f688/
466,"It was a little strange how quickly things went from ""we're not sure if you can pass Covid if you're vaxxed"" to ""masks off if you're vaxxed!"""
467,"Almost as if they were using the promise of no masks as a carrot for vaccination when maybe a ""wait and see"" approach would've been more prudent."
468,"They're doing the right thing now, but I'm tired of being reactive instead of preemptive."
469,"Even if they catch half the positives, that's still a substantial reduction"
470,Thanks for this!
471,Looks like the guy has gone through so much self loathing over the years he's completely numb to shame or decency.
472,"If you told someone that vaccinations didn't hinder transmission way back in December, people would have accepted it."
473,"During the trials, the research was inclusive  on whether or not vaccines hinder transmissions"
474,Thank you.
475,"I cannot believe that hours later, this post is still up."
476,I disagree.
477,Things are getting better but the road isn’t a straight line.
478,Covid isn’t going away even next year.
479,We are going to learn to live with it.
480,"If your community, friends, family etc would react like that to you getting a vaccine... you need to get right with life and stop hanging with folks like that."

490,Ehnn.
491,I'm still very glad I'm vaccinated.
492,If/when I do catch me some Delta the results are very likely to be minor if not completely asymptomatic.
493,"Due to the fact that the current situation means we could very well have a bunch of vaccinated asymptomatic infected walking around I'd be freaking out right now if I were a rational anti-vaxxer, but that's kind of an oxymoron."
494,"Great, that’s a stupid idea."
495,Congratulations on giving up on doing the right thing.
496,I soon as I read “Most companies are allowing for very rare religious and health exemptions” I stopped reading.

520,I had some mild symptoms and I decided to get tested as I was going to be heading out on a trip with a bunch of kids on Saturday.
521,Had it not been for that trip I probably would have just stayed home and away from everyone thinking it was a cold.
522,Honestly it’s really hard not to get annoyed that people aren’t getting vaccinated at this point.

592,"hehe, credible journalists still exist?"
593,"Naw, I say just dump the data and let the world sort through it... at least the truth will come out that way."
594,"Article text:

The Delta variant is much more contagious, more likely to break through protections afforded by the vaccines and may cause more severe disease than all other known versions of the virus, according to an internal presentation circulated within the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention."
595,"Dr. Rochelle P. Walensky, the director of the agency, acknowledged on Tuesday that vaccinated people with so-called breakthrough infections of the Delta variant carry just as much virus in the nose and throat as unvaccinated people, and may spread it just as readily, if less often."
596,But the internal document lays out a broader and even grimmer view of the variant.
597,"The Delta variant is more transmissible than the viruses that cause MERS, SARS, Ebola, the common cold, the seasonal flu and smallpox, and it is as contagious as chickenpox, according to the document, a copy of which was obtained by The New York Times."
598,"The immediate next step for the agency is to “acknowledge the war has changed,” the document said."
599,Its contents were first reported by The Washington Post on Thursday evening.
600,The document’s tone reflects alarm among C.D.C.
601,"scientists about Delta’s spread across the country, said a federal official who has seen the research described in the document."
602,The agency is expected to publish additional data on the variant on Friday.
603,“The C.D.C.
604,"is very concerned with the data coming in that Delta is a very serious threat that requires action now,” the official said."
605,"There were 71,000 new cases per day on average in the United States, as of Thursday."
606,The new data suggest that vaccinated people are spreading the virus and contributing to those numbers — although probably to a far lesser degree than the unvaccinated.
607,"Dr. Walensky has called transmission by vaccinated people a rare event, but other scientists have suggested it may be more common than once thought."
608,"The agency’s new masking guidelines for vaccinated people, introduced on Tuesday, were based on the information presented in the document."
609,The C.D.C.
610,recommended that vaccinated people wear masks indoors in public settings in communities with high transmission of the virus.
611,But the internal document hints that even that recommendation may not go far enough.
612,"“Given higher transmissibility and current vaccine coverage, universal masking is essential,” the document said."
613,The agency’s data suggest that people with weak immune systems should wear masks even in places that do not have high transmission of the virus.
614,"So should vaccinated Americans who are in contact with young children, older adults, or otherwise vulnerable people."
615,"There are roughly 35,000 symptomatic infections per week among 162 million vaccinated Americans, according to data collected by the C.D.C."
616,as of July 24 that was cited in the internal presentation.
617,"But the agency does not track all mild or asymptomatic infections, so the actual incidence may be higher."
618,"Infection with the Delta variant produces virus amounts in the airways that are tenfold higher than what is seen in people infected with the Alpha variant, which is also highly contagious, the document noted."
619,"The amount of virus in a person infected with Delta is a thousandfold more than what is seen in people infected with the original version of the virus, according to one recent study."
620,The C.D.C.
621,"document relies on data from multiple studies, including an analysis of a recent outbreak in Provincetown, Mass., which began after the town’s Fourth of July festivities."
622,"By Thursday, that cluster had grown to 882 cases."
623,"About 74 percent were vaccinated, local health officials have said."
624,"Detailed analysis of the spread of cases showed that people infected with Delta carry enormous amounts of virus in their nose and throat, regardless of vaccination status, according to the C.D.C."
625,document.
626,"“This is one of the most impressive examples of citizen science I have seen,” said Dr. Celine Gounder, an infectious disease specialist at Bellevue Hospital Center in New York."
627,"“The people involved in the Provincetown outbreak were meticulous in making lists of their contacts and exposures.”

Infection with the Delta variant may be more likely to lead to severe illness, the document noted."
628,"Studies from Canada and Scotland found that people infected with the variant are more likely to be hospitalized, while research in Singapore indicated that they are more likely to require oxygen."
629,"Still, the C.D.C.’s figures show that the vaccines are highly effective in preventing serious illness, hospitalization and death in vaccinated people, experts said."
630,"“Overall, Delta is the troubling variant we already knew it was,” said John Moore, a virologist at Weill Cornell Medicine in New York."
631,“But the sky isn’t falling and vaccination still protects strongly against the worse outcomes.”
632,Wild.

642,"You could have died, or at least got put on a ventilator or ECMO."

650,the process of communicating science shouldn't be messy though.
651,I have no idea why it seems so hard for the experts and leading governments to communicate in a way that everyone understands what is being said.
652,"For example, here in Canada we mixed and matched our vaccines (I got 1 pfizer and 1 moderna)."
653,"As we're doing this, the WHO comes out and says don't mix and match."
654,hehe... wtf?
655,Our gov then responded saying it was fine and the WHO didn't really mean it.
656,so what do canadians think of mixing and matching now?
657,haha... we don't know what to think.
658,"And no one ever clarified things more, they just left everyone confused as to what the right answer was."
659,The communication of the science gets a hard F in most countries.
660,Yes!
661,"The world, especially, India and Israel have been warning us about Delta for months now."
662,"Yet, it took this long for the USA/CDC to listen."
663,"COVID-19 is a global pandemic, even if we are all vaxxed, there might be a new variant that is able to overcome the vaccine if the world is not protected."
664,We need to think of a comprehensive plan that goes beyond vaccines.
665,"Ofc vaccine manufacturers make it sound like that vaccine is end all be all but with an evolving virus, that's clearly not a good idea."
666,"Our government needs to prioritize us over companies that want to ""reopen the economy"" by forcing people back into grey boxes after we've shown that we can do our jobs from home for 18 months."
667,Or letting vaccine companies drive the narrative.
668,AL finally leading the nation in something besides incest and lynchings
669,you will die in 8 years
670,"That's true, but that doesn't discount the benefits of getting vaxxed."
671,"It could mean the difference between a minor sniffle and a tube down your windpipe, which is why we still need as many vaccinations as possible"
672,I could think of worse things to happen to society.
673,I give it to them their strategy was working great before delta.
674,"But with only 10% vaccinated their are in for a year of pain, assuming nothing worse than delta emerges."
675,WOW.
676,That disparity in vaccination rates makes it clear how France feels about their colonies.
677,Yep &amp; then some

694,"Should ask the ones on a ventilator... ""mph phm hurrmph phhhm mmph mph"""
695,Of course it's true that we're stuck in this pandemic because of unvaccinated people.
696,"If most people were vaccinated, we'd have herd immunity and the virus would go away."
697,Mutations aren't likely to originate from vaccinated people.
698,There isn't a single valid reason to refuse the vaccine.
699,Most idiots who reject vaccination do so because they'd rather trust lies they've been fed by other idiots than the consensus of immunologists.
700,All this is about is disgusting selfishness and immature contrarianism that makes imbeciles feel free and special.

714,Why down play the progress states have made thanks to vaccination efforts?
715,"Pfizer already recommended it, last week or so."
716,They just need approval.
717,The fact the US bought another 500 million doses says the administration already is predicting this.
718,Just waiting on approval.
719,"Because it's so complex, it also breaks or glitches in many complex ways."
720,More complexity = more failure modes.
721,"Wow, what the hell did I just read?"
722,LMAO!
723,Only 34% fully vaxxed so not surprising.
724,Nah.
725,"Kansas City, Missouri just reinstated their mask mandate."
726,"&gt;And the second mistake is they do not appear to be candid about the extent to which breakthroughs are yielding hospitalizations

Ummm this is a serious charge."

&gt;Data released by the Health Ministry last week suggested that people vaccinated in January have just 16% protection against infection now, while in those vaccinated in April, the effectiveness was at 75%."
731,"Theres also concerns about their testing

&gt;Some analysts have warned that the figures on vaccine effectiveness are prone to major inaccuracies because of a range of factors, including questions over whether there is accurate data on infection levels among the non-vaccinated, which is vital for such stats."

749,"You would think that exactly for this reason people would be more inclined to get vaccinated, just to avoid receiving a huge hospital bill after a potential Covid treatment."
750,TL;DR
751,"There's some aspect of that--I think the CDC really fucked things up early on by saying masks don't work to try and hoard them for healthcare workers, but a lot of the whipsawing now is science being carried out in real time."

766,I agree.
767,The CDC has botched their messaging from jump.
768,And I say that as someone who “followed the science” and took socially distancing very seriously.
769,The mask issue in March/April of 2020 was an obvious attempt to keep masks for frontline healthcare workers.
770,The long hesitation to acknowledge airborne transmission for… whatever reason??
771,The abrupt mask-free policy for fully vaccinated individuals in May 2021 was an obvious attempt to encourage vax hesitant people to get their shots.
772,"And now, anyone who has been following this from the start has been clocking what was happening in India/UK with the delta variant, AND the breakthrough cases for months."
773,It’s incredibly frustrating.
774,"Even if you get infected post vaccine, it's still an infection same as any other, you just gave your immune system a huge leg up in fighting it."
775,"There will likely be way less chance of getting long COVID like issues if your vaccinated, but not 0% chance."
776,"Same, my siblings, friends, and I are vaccinated but I don’t think my dad is and says he doesn’t care if he gets covid."
777,He’s a believer in Fox News so ew.
778,I hate living in Alabama and wish I lived in a different state again.
779,I have an extended family member with covid and a siblings family may get it (I hope not they have a 2 year old) but they’re all vaccinated.
780,I wish people would stop exposing their sick ass selves to innocents.
781,I've seen a lot of talk about paying people to get the vaccine.
782,I feel like at this point we should announce a date in November and after that we are gonna start charging $250 for it.
783,Not really fair to poor people but I feel like if people understood the incredible value that the shot provides on a financial level they might realize how good free is compared to hospital bills.

796,I was at Hoag hospital in Newport Beach so thankfully they have all the latest equipment except for blankets… point being I’m still out of it but that could be from the lack of sleep.

837,Please get vaccinated and protect yourself + those around you.
838,Why would China have a significantly lower percentage of fully vaxxed compared to the US?
839,The US has deployed 340 million doses against a population of 328 million.
840,China has deployed 1.6 billion doses against a population of just under 1.4 billion.
841,China actually has a slightly higher dose/population ratio than the US.

932,&gt;Masks are a proven established method of preventing spread of contagious disease from person to person (and not just Covid).
933,"Even if *masks themselves* may help, how effective are *mask mandates*?"
934,That's an entirely different question.
935,Forgive me for being skeptical.
936,"For example, there are numerous factors that seem likely to stymie their effectiveness, including: 1) the unvaccinated (who are most likely to spread COVID) are the most likely to simply ignore the mandates; 2) people will still do plenty of high-risk activities indoors (e.g., eating indoors maskless); 3) to the extent folks wear masks, lots will just wear ill-fitting cloth masks or wear masks incorrectly, which -- while better than nothing -- I can't imagine it provides much protection to the immunocompromised given how damn infectious Delta is."
937,"Finally, we must remember that mask mandates -- while a lowish cost intervention at the individual level -- are not costless, particularly when the costs are aggregated across hundreds of millions of people."
938,"For how long must we ask people to do this, particularly when a miracle vaccine exists that close to eliminates the risk of death/hospitalization for the vast majority of people who take it?"
939,It’s from the CDC’s internal PowerPoint.

1016,"I forgot to put a ""should not affect""."
1017,The expansion of ICU beds in covid specific facilities would allow ERs and elective surgeries to go on as normal.
1018,We have a national guard and army core of engineers.
1019,We pay $700B+ to defense every year.
1020,Where is the call to recruit &amp; train and field medical staff to pop up and expand these Covid ICU facilities as needed?
1021,Don't people need jobs?
1022,Aren't they going to get kicked out by the rent moratorium?
1023,"It is insanity we could fight WW2 on 2 fronts on 2 separate continents in opposite directions, but we can't figure out how to expand ICU capacity by a few hundred beds when needed and transfer in the medical staff needed on some sort of two weeks one two weeks off schedule where the workers can go home and come back on govt."

1030,"Your cloth mask does nothing, you have the KN95 mask, just wear it"
1031,Don't downvote me please but I have a hypothetical question.
1032,"If you are vaccinated, wouldn't it be in your interest to not wear a mask?"
1033,"If you catch Covid, it will be relatively mild and confer natural immunity for Delta."
1034,I know you run the risk of getting long haul symptoms.
1035,"But isn't it better to get Delta now when your vaccine still confer some protection, instead of say 6 months from now when your vaccine protection is much weaker?"
1036,That comment makes no sense.

1045,*
1046,You're right that everyone not vaxxed is not an anti-masker nut.
1047,"There are other communities, such as communities of color, where the vax rate is much lower than it should be."
1048,"But please don't forget that some of the reason for that is the misinformation being propagated by the anti-mask, anti-vaxx crowd."
1049,"Make no mistake, they deserve every ounce of the blame that's being heaped upon them."
1050,&gt;	The hospitalization rates are low enough that we don’t need to worry about medical collapse anymore.
1051,"In my area, the ICU capacity is almost back to 100% utilized and we are very early in the delta wave so far."
1052,"Half the population being vaccinated helps a ton, but the delta is nearly twice as infectious which could mean it runs through the unvaxed population *just as fast* as the original would have without any precautions...

&gt;	New data shows the vaccines don’t prevent catching covid and don’t prevent spreading it."
1053,This is blatantly untrue.
1054,"They don’t *guarantee* you won’t catch/spread it as much as with the original strain, but they still significantly reduce the chances and thus also  reduce the risk to others who can’t be vaccinated for legitimate reasons."
1055,May Covid take them all.

1069,Because the economy consultants step in.
1070,Is this personal attack part of your understanding and sympathetic way of interacting?
1071,Not hard enough.
1072,Unvaxxed everyday life has to be impossible until they get the vaccine.
1073,"Total number of cases is also misleading, because the number or kids who show enough symptoms to get tested is going to be vastly less than the number of kids who caught the virus and are asymptomatic."
1074,&gt;On top of that it looks like a decent number will get it once it's approved and/or required by their employer.
1075,"Most people maybe, but some people will always find a way to not get vaccinated."
1076,"In France, your business but also malls, trains etc require you to be vaccinated (you have to show a ""health pass"") and anti-vax prefer to be fired than to be vaccinated."
1077,Also there is a big network of fake vaccination certificates.
1078,There was a scandal exposed recently by a newspaper here that some nurses are corrupted and pretend to vaccinate you for money.
1079,"Cool, but until the entire world is vaccinated variants beating out vaccines will still be a threat no matter what happens in USA"
1080,"They showed a small graph of changes in cases, absolute numbers, they where talking about the UK, EU and US and said all numbers where high."

1082,"[https://i.imgur.com/zogphLa.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/zogphLa.jpg) 

But it shows absolut number of cases, not adjusted for population, the UK of course being much smaller in population compared to EU and US."
1083,The US of course is the largest of these.
1084,"This was in context of the ""vaccine passports"""
1085,"It could be 100%, and I don't think it'd make that big of a difference."

Meanwhile:

&gt;The breakthrough cases are to be expected, the CDC briefing states, and will probably rise as a proportion of all cases because there are so many more people vaccinated now."
1089,"This echoes data seen from studies in other countries, including highly vaccinated Singapore, where 75 percent of new infections reportedly occur in people who are partially and fully vaccinated."
1090,"https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2021/07/29/cdc-mask-guidance/

Sorry, coronavirus is here to stay."
1091,"From the same article:

&gt;“We really need to shift toward a goal of preventing serious disease and disability and medical consequences, and not worry about every virus detected in somebody’s nose,” Neuzil said."
1092,"“It’s hard to do, but I think we have to become comfortable with coronavirus not going away.”

We can stop demonizing the people who don't want a vaccine now."
1093,That’s what I thought too.
1094,[removed]
1095,Interested in this as well.
1096,"Since my job is preventing sti transmission in my county, all the time is the worst time to go to an orgy, so I really don’t think the logic is there to begin with"
1097,Good.
1098,So another year or two covid till we all got new vaccines against Delta and enough of the planet are innoculated by then.
1099,By then we'll already have 5-6 more dangerous variants of concern.
1100,How do we ever get out of this shit?
1101,:(
1102,I bet that does really well with climate change
1103,Time for war
1104,"The theory (and this isn’t born out by any published data, it is just extrapolated from general immunology) is that when the body encounters more of a pathogen in the wild or with another dose of vaccine, it ramps up the production of antibodies in *anticipation* of there being a plague going around and needing to have its primary defenses kicked into high gear targeting that specific thing."
1105,"After going awhile without seeing more of that, those primary defenses/antibodies tend to drop because you can’t be on high alert all the time for everything, but you still have long lasting immunity because the body knows exactly what to make as soon as it sees that specific target again."
1106,The concern with the variants is that they might have higher breakthrough rates because they infect faster or are harder to attach antibodies to than the og strain... so the reduced levels of antibodies and ability to call up new orders of them when exposed isn’t as effective as we would like.
1107,So having your body *already flooded* with those antibodies from a more recent exposure might be more effective at preventing breakthrough.
1108,Thank you!
1109,This was the recommended way to deal with it some places.
1110,It’s way way nastier when you get it as an adult.
1111,"They started later but yes, they will get fully vaccinated numbers much higher than US."
1112,I don’t know!
1113,Is it something they can get from the swab test or bloodwork?
1114,I can’t contact the hospital and ask.

1140,"dont worry, the whole country of Poland (12% pop size of US) once had for two weeks 40-60% positivity rate and still nobody gave a shit."
1141,it can get way worse…
1142,"&gt; Not great

I would not panic at all with this finding."
1143,"* 1437 total workers 
* 39 breakthrough infections detected (~2.7% of total)
* 8 reporting symptoms lasting longer than six weeks (~19% of infections, or 0.6% of total)

The NEJM article doesn't specifically state what the age and health history of the 8 ""long-haul"" persons were, but I'd be willing to bet they're on the older side with somewhat compromised immune systems."
1144,"Bottom line: you're young, healthy, and fully vaccinated?"
1145,Green light.
1146,It’s value***(1 + growthrate)^time.
1147,"So if the starting infection percentage is 5% and it’s growing at a rate of 7% every day, then after 10 days it’s 5***(1 + 0.07)^10 = 9.8% or nearly double."
1148,"But that comment about 7% was misplaced, don’t conflate the current positivity rate with the growth rate."
1149,"The positivity rate is 21.5%, but the article says nothing about the growth rate."
1150,"So 1 in 5 people tested are positive, but that alone says nothing about how many you can expect to test positive next week."
1151,Nope.
1152,Not wearing a mask again.
1153,I and everyone I know are fully vaccinated and therefore I no longer care about the virus.
1154,I don't care if there are new waves.
1155,Even ignoring that the manner in which cases are falling is strange.
1156,"Herd immunity is not a switch which is either on or off, reaching it should lead to a gradual plateau and then fall."
1157,The rapid decline in cases is strange and not something that can be 100% attributed to herd immunity.
1158,Funny that some houndred cases in a 8.5million city in China is called ravaged while most other metropolitan areas would hope to get down to that.
1159,USA is a union of states.
1160,EU is a union of countries.
1161,It's much less than 17 times.
1162,The uk data suggests it's more like 10 times less likely...
1163,But it could be even lower because you're less likely to be symptomatic and go for testing.
1164,It's hugely effective.
1165,Delta is just massively infectious.
1166,"If alpha caused surges during distancing and lockdowns, what does a variant that is more than twice as infectious do when people aren't doing anything?"
1167,"Well, it can spread even if the majority of the people are vaccinated."
1168,Hit 90 percent plus of population and that might change.
1169,Hit 95 percent of your elderly and youve largely solved the serious illness and death portion.
1170,Nowhere in the us has done the former.
1171,Quite a few areas have done the latter.
1172,[removed]
1173,It means your immune system is already prepared to fight the virus.
1174,"It’s trained already, that’s the whole point, and how vaccines work."
1175,"It means your body will shut down a new infection faster, before it can do serious damage."
1176,"If you would not be vaccinated, the body would spend time learning how to fight it, losing valuable time."
1177,"Besides there are other reasons, if there was a virus that killed 50% of people over 50, but everyone under 50 didn’t notice."
1178,Should you not try to limit the spread?
1179,Fake so called pastors.
1180,Their sole purpose is to fleece their gullible church members
1181,I see nothing wrong with being extra-cautious around unvaxxed children during an outbreak like the one we're experiencing.
1182,But adults who chose not to get vaxxed?

1193,"Well, I wouldn't be 100% well from long COVID if I didn't have any because where I am you can get it even if you're stuck at home 24/7."
1194,Many will applaud this decision that will result in their death.
1195,Vaccines have never been able to stop you catching a virus.
1196,They aren't a shield that stops you catching it.
1197,"What they do is make it so your immune system is already ""primed"" to deal with it when you *do* catch it."
1198,"Hopefully, thanks to the vaccine, your immune system can clear up the virus without you ever knowing you actually had it (and most of the time that is what it does)."
1199,Naturally this will lower transmissability because you'll be shedding the virus for a *much* shorter time if your immune system promptly kills it off.
1200,"It just doesn't stand to reason that the virus spreads ""as easily thorugh the vaccinated population as easily as the unvaccinated"", as most vaccinated people won't be coughing all over the place, most vaccinated people will be shedding virus for a *very* short period of time (compared to the unvaccinated who might do so for a couple of weeks or more)."

1208,"(School was a big exception, they wore them there) 

Luckily my grandmother made everyone she watches wear them, so I felt better about her well being."
1209,"But it hit me mainly when I was in a Harley Davidson trying to drop off my grandfather’s bike to be worked on, that they were having an event there, and with around 40+ people, nobody had one on."
1210,This moron's stupid policy is going to get some people killed.
1211,"Media isn't really interested in reporting science accurately, no clickbait potential and much work."

1213,"I'm vaccinated and will wear a mask outdoors, but I'll be damned if it's to protect the unvaccinated."

1239,"They are worried about the cold, flu, uti, any real virus or infection."
1240,So we know the vaccines aren’t even close to being as  effective in stop and spreading covid.
1241,So all you are doing is masking your symptoms and protecting only yourself.
1242,So yeah.
1243,That argument holds very little weight.
1244,You aren’t doing it for others.

1257,He's suppressing as much bad news as he can to make everything look nice.
1258,People are really stupid.
1259,The CDC reasonably corrected themselves after aerosol transmission became known - and therefore people are angry?
1260,"Also masks do not really help to ""protect"" yourself unless you're working with infected people and wearing a face shield in a way a common man would understand."
1261,They reduce the chance of transmission (considerably) but they neither replace keeping a distance nor staying at home.
1262,A common man would wear a mask \_instead\_ of doing both.
1263,"I experienced it in my local news: Everybody was eager for my country's health organisation to say something like ""masks might work"" in order to drop all stay-at-home recommendations and open up -  more than 85 % of all covid deaths here are due to us depending on masks only."

1311,We’re assistants on an insurance brokerage team; I don’t know the details but she no longer had the mental capacity for the job and after five weeks of time off was fired.
1312,Not sure of her health profile but she’s 27-33 years old.
1313,"Auburn fan here, pro-vax liberal."
1314,"if Tuberville is supporting the vaccine, that actually makes me not want it... That man is an idiot"
1315,"“Right now, about 35K vaccinated Americans having breakthrough infections weekly
Sound high?"
1316,"Actually, probably 300K unvaccinated Americans having infections weekly
And given 50% of Americans are vaccinated
That's a rough vaccine effectiveness of around 88%
Very rough”"
1317,This is posibly a new variant?
1318,That might explain why children are getting killed in that ammount by COVID
1319,"Again, all fair points."
1320,Appreciate the additional insight.
1321,At the end of the day I guess each state through its legislature (NOT Governor dictates) can decide how they want to run their state.
1322,"And we as people can choose what state fits us best, ideally speaking."
1323,Although I'm not Pollyannaish enough to really think there isn't more going on.
1324,Have a great weekend.
1325,That bullshit nearly caused me to be blind.
1326,"I got pox in my eye and it caused a ton of corneal scarring, I still have lots  of eye issues, I can’t drive at night, and I get bad eye strain pretty frequently so I have difficulty with holding work that require extensive computer use or vision in general (which uh...is a lot.)"
1327,I really really hate that people called chickenpox “just a childhood disease” well it can fuck up your life pretty irreversibly.
1328,And the dumbasses that survive it will just put the same morons that let this happen back into office.
1329,World keeps spinnin’
1330,"&gt;  am vaccinated and get tested regularly for work (it’s freelance)

Not an expert but it seems pretty pointless to get tested without symptoms if you're vaccinated."
1331,Vaccins will do their work when the virus enters your body.
1332,Tests can still pick up the small amounts of virus without you being infectious.
1333,There are other countries that have had Delta for a while now.
1334,They've studied the effects of the same vaccines we are using and found the protection is still very strong.
1335,Since when is 90% invulnerable?
1336,These people really dont give a dmn about their constituents huh?
1337,It’s something but it’s incredibly demoralizing to keep catering to selfish people who make the wrong choices.
1338,Throw us a bone.
1339,"I don’t understand how this year they’re like “every school must open full time in the fall!” If this variant is so transmissible, yet last year many schools waited to open in person."
1340,Doesn’t make sense.
1341,"My previous coworker caught covid and he mentioned how sometimes he feels off, cant remember easy things, or how to solve problems he usually did no issue."
1342,"His wife mentioned that he could have ""covid brain"" for 6 months after he recovered."
1343,Only symptoms he had was loss of taste and smell for a while.
1344,What a shitty job
1345,Fuck that dude
1346,"Bama has also won championships in softball, golf, and gymnastics."
1347,"Somehow, I don't think that's what you mean."
1348,"Quick recap for those just joining us:

* Delta ( bad )
* Vaccines ( good )
* masks ( use )
* large crowds ( use caution )
* panic ( no no no )

You all stay safe."
1349,Shocker
1350,"Me, too."
1351,Six weeks of Covid symptoms.
1352,Two strep and one regular flu test were all negative.
1353,"If they were negative, they're negative."
1354,Calm down.
1355,There are other sicknesses in the world that aren't Covid.
1356,[removed]
1357,Same thing with my kids.
1358,They did virtual last year and were planning on going back to school in three weeks.
1359,I'm not sure what we're going to do.
1360,Our district still hasn't released any kind of safety plan or anything.
1361,Guess it comes from my experience with the cape cod outbreak.
1362,Delta variant seems to be changing things.
1363,Nothing really new here - just another vaccine for another disease.
1364,"Not sure what the current rules are, but when I was a brat my father (Air Force) had to get a barrage of vaccines."
1365,"I know you get paid but thank you, as well."
1366,"My 3 yo got it in January and yet didn’t pass it to me, my husband or 4 mo old."
1367,She literally had no symptoms and we wouldn’t have even known if we didn’t get her tested.
1368,&gt; Anyone else just lost with what’s going on?
1369,Nope.
1370,Just defer to CDC Guidelines.
1371,"I really hope your right, last I was told all I needed to do was be vaccinated."
1372,"I really don't care about the masks, but you damn well know it won't stop there."
1373,This is a surprise to anyone?
1374,"Let ""freedom"" run its course, to me that means the rest of us can be free from idiots."
1375,The way the ACA is written makes it very difficult to charge more for any behaviors but tobacco use.
1376,I think Congress would actually need to pass an amendment to even make it legal.
1377,I'm not aware of whether this would prevent them from going the other way and offering discounts for vaccinated instead.
1378,Covid Tide
1379,Yeah.
1380,If im scared by anything related to covid its that what if i lose my ability to read and write.
1381,Especially since I tend to read fairly difficult texts.
1382,Itd mean losing the most enjoyable thing in my life.
1383,What would I have left then?
1384,Ugh.
1385,Did solid snake write this document?
1386,That's an important question for which we just got [this new data yesterday](https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/otpask/breakthrough_covid_infections_after_vaccination/).
1387,"It's not comprehension or something to run home to, but there you go."
1388,About 19%.
1389,This was mostly for the previous variants by the way.
1390,Several of my nurse friends have become increasingly stressed in the past week.
1391,I'm in a group chat with them and they've said they've seen an alarming amount of vaccinated individuals come into their hospital quite sick.
1392,"I don't know how many is ""an alarming amount"" since they haven't given any numbers, but it's enough that they're now worried for their own safety despite being fully vaccinated."
1393,Several of them work at a hospital in Dallas and one of them in Austin and they all claim more and more patients are coming in.
1394,"I know this is anecdotal but if it's like that at two separate hospitals I'm sure it's like that at most across the states, or atleast in the south where there is still vaccine hesitancy."
1395,The amount of unvaccinated in the hospitals still far outweigh the amount vaccinated however.
1396,I think right now any officals are weary to report the numbers in fear that it may cause those who are unvaccinated to double down on their beliefs.
1397,"While simultaneously saying ""you can't control me!"""
1398,Honestly let these people just kill each other
1399,Because they’ll die off?
1400,"&gt;The value of putting Denmark, Portugal and Bulgaria in the same figure is beyond me."
1401,You could say the same of Massachusetts vs. Mississippi in the US as well.
1402,"I meant *like kn95 masks"""
1403,"&gt; They were told they could investigate further, but the city’s Department of Environmental Protection initially offered no additional funding or support for their efforts."
1404,"&gt; “The city officials basically told us if we wanted to do any kind of surveillance of the rats we would have to do it ourselves,” Dr. Marc Johnson, a virologist at the University of Missouri, wrote in a June 9 email obtained through an open-records request by the Documenting COVID-19 project."
1405,"“They had zero willingness to help explore this potential public health risk.”

You can find anything in New York, even previously unseen mutations."
1406,That’s still millions of sick people
1407,"that’s a good point— actually upon looking at the data again, it seems like the 74% number is of a smaller denominator of positive cases from MA permanent residents only, it’s not from the full ~800 positives."
1408,So in a way we have even less information than I had assumed.
1409,"But anyway, though I’d guess the vaccination rate of “MA residents visiting Ptown” is still quite high, you’re right that it may not be *as* high."
1410,The CDC website will lag behind everything else.
1411,This is a developing situation.
1412,Their actions are speaking louder than their words to me.
1413,Be nah guidance and reports of internal documents imply something else is going on.
1414,"We'll know soon, but the CDC is a political organization and they are cautious, so they aren't actually sharing everything."
1415,They're running processes that take time.
1416,"I agree that vaccines are still effective, but not as effective at stopping transmission and we don't know hospitalizations yet because it's literally being tested at scale for the first time, right now."
1417,"It's not some protection, it's a lot of protection, only slightly reduced for Delta."
1418,&gt; Sorry this keeps going.
1419,It's awful.
1420,Butt putting your head in the sand won't change anything.
1421,Doing the same things we did over and over again last year to try to eradicate Covid will not change anything.
1422,Roll Tide!
1423,Will keeping my kids in kf94 (like know masks) masks protect them at school even if most kids and adults around them will not be wearing them?
1424,True true.
1425,I have never caught the flu.
1426,Have only had a couple colds in my life.
1427,"I definitely think it’s doable to never get Covid, and I hope to never have it."
1428,The only thing I noticed is that cases did eventually level off and drop in countries like India and UK who had the Delta variant as the most widespread strain.
1429,Shouldn't we expect the same to happen in the US fairly soon?
1430,They didn't have exponential growth and neither should we.
1431,Is that their covid rate or their vaccination rate?Either seems about right.
1432,Some people have had luck with antihistamines and niacin.
1433,So it's there an Alabama mutation yet?
1434,"I was talking with a friend for a while outside, but within six feet for &gt; 15 minutes."
1435,"I'm vaccinated, and he mentioned his wife and kids have had high fevers and coughs."
1436,"It sounds like the kids were swab tested when they were brought to the doctor, and the wife did the drive-thru self swab (PCR i believe), and all were negative for Covid."
1437,"I feel very nervous still, though they said it's just a summer cold."
1438,Would you guys take precaution?
1439,I got a 3rd dose of Pfizer on Monday this week.
1440,"I’m type-1 diabetic, and my wife said it would be a good idea since I’m considered “high risk”."
1441,Covid increased my sense of smell...possibly because it also has dried out my nose/mouth/eyes.
1442,We are still in the dark with so many symptoms.
1443,"As an Alabama resident, it’s incredibly frustrating to see this."
1444,I constantly argue with people over getting the vaccine.
1445,"I’ve reached a point where I can’t feel bad for most of these people anymore, they’ve had the chance and there’s plenty more research out now for them to make that decision."
1446,Now it’s just bc they don’t want to.
1447,At this stage in the pandemic you are part of the problem if you’re allowing your cousin to remain unvaccinated.
1448,You need to be more confrontational about this.
1449,"You can’t just let it go, you should have blew up at him and yelled and told him to get vaccinated."
1450,Every unvaccinated person has someone close to them that’s vaccinated.
1451,It’s time to step up and put on the pressure.
1452,Make it uncomfortable make it clear what they’re doing is wrong and you don’t approve of it.
1453,"That’s pretty much exactly what just happened in the UK, in my opinion."
1454,"I wouldn’t vote for him either, but as you yourself point out, the bar is low."
1455,"Just look at the last few presidential primaries, just about anyone runs."
1456,"In fact I would argue that Abbott is more qualified to be president than Trump ever was, he has actual experience governing."
1457,"This might make him a more dangerous president than Trump was, extremist policies + competence."
1458,"Abbott will be touting what they call the Texas miracle, which is the growth of Texas due to companies moving their HQ’s to TX from the expensive coastal states because of tax breaks."
1459,While hiding that the TX budget still strongly relies on the dying oil and gas industry and as a result school budgets are being gutted.
1460,"But hey, an ignorant populace seems to vote Republican, so it’s a double win!"

1473,And what is the CDC response… you should wear a cloth mask… against a virus as infectious as chickenpox… again complete bullshit.
1474,A proper response would have been you need to avoid indoor crowded spaces yesterday especially if elderly or vulnerable and if you need to go out you need to wear higher quality masks.

1512,Vaccinated hospitalizations are extremely rare.
1513,One anecdote on Reddit does not change that.
1514,Nothing is zero risk.
1515,The personal risk to a fully vaccinated person is still very low.
1516,"Here, straight from the CDC website:

&gt; Infections happen in only a small proportion of people who are fully vaccinated, even with the Delta variant."
1517,"&gt; Moreover, when these infections occur among vaccinated people, they tend to be mild."
1518,&gt; Currently authorized vaccines in the United States are highly effective at protecting vaccinated people against symptomatic and severe COVID-19.
1519,"Fully vaccinated people are less likely to become infected and, if infected, to develop symptoms of COVID-19."
1520,They are at substantially reduced risk of severe illness and death from COVID-19 compared with unvaccinated people.

1556,NJ and RI are the first and second most densely-populated states in the country.

1634,I get science around the virus changing and whatnot but this is ridiculous.
1635,The WHO is bad enough but the CDC has been almost as inconsistent
1636,"https://charlatan.ca/2013/08/macleans-lists-most-educated-provinces/

Not according to this, Alberta is Behind Ontario, Yukon, BC, and PEI for Post secondary education."
1637,"Alberta is tied with NS, NB and Quebec at 46% PSE."
1638,"If the virus is a few mutations away from escaping masks, lockdowns and vaccines then it underscores the need to go for elimination."
1639,Well known that it’s unfathomably rare.
1640,Username checks out.. Not.
1641,[Still better than NY and NJ](https://www.statista.com/statistics/1109011/coronavirus-covid19-death-rates-us-by-state/)
1642,there may be more maybe less
1643,That's all they do.
1644,If they don't double down they get outflanked on the right.
1645,"Good, fuck'em..."
1646,My husband’s job gave everyone a full paid day off to go get the vaccine quite a while ago.
1647,👍🏼
1648,IMPORTANT POINT: it was by 2% points: 25 vs 23.
1649,That’s statistically minuscule.
1650,Bet a second study finds no difference.
1651,It’s the same type of crowd.
1652,Do you have a source for the pediatric case and hospitalization numbers?
1653,Are these &lt;12 or 12-17 yos?
1654,"From the charts I liked, it looks like the number of cases in the &lt;12 population is still small."
1655,"Don't get me wrong - I am cautious about my kids; they still mask indoors, and we don't eat in restaurants."
1656,"They obviously aren't going to clubs or bars, but school is the biggest risk for them right now."
1657,"In terms of Covid, I think it's important to weigh the relative risk of Covid with the potential harm to their mental state."
1658,What is the original context for this?
1659,Another person said it's a W quote but what was he referring to?
1660,Covid or is this an old quote that just works?
1661,This nonsense with executive orders.
1662,Shit needs to go away
1663,"True, but thats mostly because Massachusetts and NYC were the first to get slammed before we had enough tests to test anybody, really uderstood how it spread, or knew how to treat it."
1664,"COVID tore through the nursing homes in the Northeast when the CDC was still saying ""regular people don't need masks"" and ""you can only get tested if you just got back from China or Italy""."
1665,It’s getting increasingly hard for public health discussions to be apolitical when one political party is completely disregarding public health recommendations.
1666,the nbers are fudged
1667,"I'm a Christian, churchgoer and volunteer in FL."
1668,I cherish my church family and have found a several great friends in that community.
1669,The leadership stays out of politics.
1670,"It's still a super difficult pill to swallow that a large swath of those around me play the politics over science and reason, and the politics over people game."
1671,"I'm quite sure Jesus would have encouraged people to get protected against the illness to protect their neighbor, if anything."
1672,So I'm perplexed and discouraged as well.
1673,"Our executive pastor comes from a medical background, has been pro precautions through the whole pandemic, but I wish she would be encouraging people at least to consult with their doctors and listen to them about getting a vaccine."
1674,Right now a large portion of volunteers and staff are sick with the Delta variant.
1675,I'm going to be pulling back from going in person for a bit.
1676,"Never, it would seem."
1677,No one is going to step up for human rights.
1678,I worked in at a 2 year technical college with a nursing program.
1679,"It was full of hard working, single parents, taking night classes but the program was also full of all the people who were bussing tables because they never would have gotten into a regular 4 year college."
1680,"Not that traditional college is for everyone, but like people with bad grades and below 900 SATs."
1681,I thought it was actually great proof that you shouldn't judge someone for that if they can go on to do something as important as nursing then this shit went down.
1682,"That is incorrect, and explicitly not what the slides say."
1683,Direct link to slides [here](https://www.washingtonpost.com/context/cdc-breakthrough-infections/11fc6a11-20d7-466e-a654-c6bc8426f688/).
1684,"Slide 17 headline: “Delta variant vaccine breakthrough cases may be as transmissible as unvaccinated cases”

Slide 22 summary: “Breakthrough infections may be as transmissible as unvaccinated cases”"
1685,People need to realize the CDC can and will be used as a political tool.
1686,"There’s no grand conspiracy and the CDC is still a vital and positive thing, but it’s naive to think they really don’t answer to the Executive branch."
1687,"Also, people seem to have forgotten that the FDA was an underfunded, industry-infiltrated shit show before Covid and that it hasn’t changed."
1688,Some people move for the promise of low taxes and deregulation but you're getting what you paid for.
1689,Which are the biggest driver of spread historically
1690,Facebook News…those consumers skew older
1691,What happened to the idea that private companies have the freedom to do what they please?
1692,I respect that.
1693,I have emphasized that my decision is based on how kids are being impacted.
1694,More kids are getting sick with Covid and if that continues I will get the vaccine
1695,Or really seems like care about.
1696,"From one of my sisters, 15 months ago, People die everyday, who cares."
1697,For all the anti Vax and non believers.
1698,"I do care, I dont wanna die for a F... Coronavirus."
1699,"Every time I get a coronavirus infection, I end in a bed for a week..."
1700,This shit (covid-19) is gonna kill me.
1701,"Shame or not, theres nothing stopping vacced ppl for having partys all day since 18 month."
1702,"They deserved it and should ignore anyone telling them to stay home

Vacced ppl should be fine anyway even if they catch it, unvacced ppl shouldnt be on the party, so its their own fault they catch it while being unvacced and dying."
1703,&gt;No mask mandate in schools with an entirely unvacinated population + delta varrient as infectious as chickenpox?
1704,What could possibly go wrong guys?!
1705,Something something freedom!
1706,/s
1707,I think I’m going to hang out in city hall and cough non stop and claim I have COVID.
1708,🤷🏻‍♂️
1709,"Well... we know how many infections there have been in the UK, and it's a lot."
1710,Easily over 1.5 million official cases since Delta became the dominant variant in the country and half a year since they have been tracking it.
1711,"People under 20 are not being hospitalized or dying to it at all (there may be some individual cases, but they are exceedingly rare)."
1712,"To be fair, if the child has specific conditions that make them more vulnerable than others in their age group, but I'm sure their parent will know."
1713,I'm just speaking in general population level terms.
1714,"Uh oh, the stereotypical idiot state does something that demonstrates they are stereotypical idiots"
1715,They all have a card issued with vaccination though right?
1716,Isn’t that nationwide for vaccine tracking purposes.
1717,"Fixed: sir this is Alabama:

**~~step~~brother gas entered the chat**"
1718,Ah American politics.
1719,This could never backfire.
1720,Arizona too.
1721,My kids start school Monday and masks aren’t required smh.
1722,Utter nonsense.
1723,Public spaces is a huge caveat and may ignore things like private residences.
1724,What do you mean probably?
1725,Anyone can see how this will end up.
1726,Great twitter thread about it here: [https://twitter.com/JamesSurowiecki/status/1420988736247062529](https://twitter.com/JamesSurowiecki/status/1420988736247062529)
1727,We're number one!
1728,"&gt; well I frankly don't care

If you really didn't care you wouldn't continue to reply."
1729,My mom moved to Arizona twenty years ago and married a biker.
1730,She said they believed in “freedom” and were happy that AZ didn’t mandate helmets.
1731,He died just before the pandemic from injuries resulting from a motorcycle accident that left him partially paralyzed with minor brain damage.
1732,They both voted for Trump.
1733,"The moral of this tale is that, yes, people would rather die unnecessarily than give up what they believe to be liberties."
1734,How about this?
1735,Let's all get vaccinated and then we'll see if it's our ticket out.
1736,I have to imagine if we were sitting at a 97% vaccination rate among those eligible that this whole Delta variant thing would have played out a lot differently.
1737,"I had to upvote, it’s an older meme but boy does it check out"
1738,Thanks!
1739,Except for being a complete nutjob
1740,Texas not gonna be Texas when all the Texans are dead.
1741,This guy would make a great Champion of Nurgle if he was in the 40k universe.
1742,"This data doesn't show what will happen if cases go up again, which is bound to happen."
1743,"Also, maybe let people make their own informed decision and decide for themselves, instead of telling them what they *should* be worried about?"
1744,Just a thought.
1745,"The problem is, a federal judge will likely strike the law down."
1746,The highly conservative Court of Appeals will then uphold it.
1747,Then it'll go to the Supreme Court but that'll take awhile.
1748,Arkansas doesn't have that much time.
1749,Abbot is such a colossal asshole.
1750,"Literally doing nothing would have likely saved lives, but no… This dickwad decides to show up and make things worse."
1751,I literally hate the GOP and the voters that keep these self serving assholes in-charge.
1752,This is March 2020 all over again.
1753,Buy your N95s!
1754,Home Depot still has them.
1755,I literally never buy concessions at Broadway shows for this very reason.
1756,I can't stomach the price and I doubt I could even if I were a millionaire.
1757,"As a disclaimer, I think this is definitely a big step in the right direction, but to what extent can they actually mandate the vaccines without full FDA approval?"
1758,If I was in charge I’d sign a law that prohibits him from being in those cities.
1759,"Also, upticks in infection rates usually trigger more restrictions."
1760,Lower rates lead to lower restrictions.

1767,Yea those are a couple good things to avoid.
1768,"Also for the rest of us ambulances get turned away and sent to hospitals farther away, so the rest of us with our issues large and small might have to deal with that and our surgeries cancelled and some preventative care gets missed and some early diagnosis gets missed so people die from things completely not related to covid because their timing meant they needed medical care when the hospitals and care teams were not available because they were dealing with covid."
1769,"Just saying 70% of the whole state is vaccinated, and the case numbers are quite low."
1770,Deaths are not rising either
1771,It's crazy how it's always the ones you least suspect.
1772,They would be so much better off with just no governor at all.
1773,Same with Texas.
1774,[removed]
1775,It isn't totally useless.
1776,The chin diapers should help expedite the natural herd immunity and possible death of those that that don't want to get vaccinated.
1777,Meanwhile vaccinated people will not suffer the severe symptoms unvaccinated people will have.
1778,Cherry picking infers that a choice was made and that someone isn't just blindly parroting the verbal pablum fed them.
1779,And deaths per capita?
1780,"Literally, not everyone is dying from Covid IN FACT the fatality rate of y’all’s super star delta is lower then the original virus is."
1781,But continue to preach BB
1782,This pleases Nurgle.
1783,"The opening line couldn't be more inaccurate: 

""We were so close to conquering COVID-19."""
1784,"Um, how much of the world is vaccinated?"
1785,Absolutely about the anti-vaxxers.
1786,"Thinking this incident through, I’m pretty sure this study is probably centered on Provincetown (the article mentions large events in Barnstable County and I, a gay, can infer what that means), and I suspect that crowd was probably mostly vaccinated."
1787,"It does make sense that as the population becomes more vaccinated, a larger proportion of the vaxxed will get infected."
1788,That’s all based on my own inferences about this crowd though.

And they just are completely apoplectic when you say ""well, yeah, it is."""
1796,"It was fine for two weeks, it was getting pretty old by the time December rolled around, but we were in a huge surge and the vaccines weren't available yet, so it was well worth it then."

1798,*Nah.
1799,"*

If the mask offered me any additional meaningful protection, maybe I'd look at it differently."
1800,"But I'm vaccinated, so any additional protection it would give me is meaningless."
1801,It's just an inconvenience that does absolutely nothing for me.
1802,"These people act like masking up has absolutely zero downsides, and they are just flat out wrong."
1803,Comparing wearing a mask to wearing a shirt is laughable.
1804,"Like yeah, I'm sure it is easy for you to wear a mask if you get groceries delivered, you work from home, and you never leave the house."

1810,"Fuck that, they can order groceries and meds for contactless delivery."
1811,The only thing you can leave the house for is life and limb emergency.
1812,This is really mutating the wrong way.
1813,"In the States, we need it to have worse effects on people, not spread more easily."
1814,Hopefully if repercussions increase people will get vaccinated and stop endangering everyone by increasing the odds of a breakthrough variant.
1815,[removed]
1816,[removed]
1817,What’s your point?
1818,You can’t measure effectiveness if you can’t compare the results to the unvaccinated group.
1819,A majority of the people were vaccinated.
1820,Similar to that headline we saw a few weeks ago stating 40% of hospitalizations are among the fully vaxxed!
1821,"Completely neglecting the fact that the population was highly vaccinated, so of course, eventually, you’re going to see more people hospitalized who were fully vaccinated."
1822,"What’s improved is the effect the vaccines have on the entire community, and all the data points to these vaccines taking the steam out of COVID."
1823,"Also, immunology is way more complex than you’re giving it credit for."
1824,I suggest you read the debate that’s going on among experts regarding this study.
1825,Not the mRNA “vaccine”.
1826,"It’s designed to lessen the symptoms of the cytokine storm, not help the immune system fight it."
1827,Excellent context!
1828,Thanks for sharing.
1829,"I know my older relatives 55+ prefer to still go in to shop, probably just because its ""normal"" and an experience."

1832,The problem is they're acting like toddlers.
1833,"When you tell a kid they can't do something for their own protection, they want to do it even more."
1834,The same is true here with vaccines and masks.
1835,"You tell people they should wear masks and get vaccinated to protect everyone, including themselves."
1836,"But *telling them* is the problem, because it just makes them get defensive and stamp their feet."
1837,"If they don't come to the conclusion ""on their own"", they think they're being bullied into it by the libs, just like being told to do/not do something by their parents."
1838,It pisses them off and they think you're calling them too stupid to know better.
1839,So they get irrational and refuse purely on the grounds that they don't want to do what they're told.
1840,You gonna charge your cousin for that?
1841,Lol
1842,"""Long covid"" is treated as a bizarre novel thing that only Covid does, but it's not."
1843,"Viral infections of all sorts mess you up and can take a long time to recover from, this is true for the flu."
1844,This is especially true if the illness is severe.
1845,It's common and well understood.
1846,"Covid is more severe than the flu and no one had any existing immunity, so it's reasonable to expect to see more long term symptoms as your body recovers from the damage (or doesn't 100%)."
1847,"Basically, there's no reason to expect that functional vaccines wouldn't also protect you from ""long covid."""
1848,The virus can't do damage if your immune system is successfully fighting it.
1849,I mean there’s also a very good chance that delta will peak and burn out quickly like it did in the UK and India.
1850,I can only do my part
1851,Texan here.
1852,They aren't.
1853,Masks are becoming exceedingly rare.
1854,Almost nobody at my job wears them despite still having new covid cases here.
1855,And i see almost zero masks at the store/gas station/wherever.
1856,Nope!
1857,That’s not how this works.
1858,The author of this post said they proved vaccines do not get integrated into the genome.
1859,They have no proof.
1860,If I said I proved Bigfoot doesn’t exist you’d probably ask me to show work rather than asking anyone who says I’m full of shit to independently prove Bigfoot exists.
1861,"I am saying there’s no proof that mRNA vaccines don’t integrate (especially in this paper), not saying that they do."
1862,"If you can’t understand the difference there it’s your problem, not mine."
1863,Obviously the mods agreed because they took this post down.
1864,Sounds great...I just got notified that a conference is was supposed to attend in Austin in September will be canceled so that will be a few thousand people NOT coming to your state because you can't get a handle on Covid.
1865,That is fully on YOU!
1866,I think they meant one they could muster a real argument against 😜
1867,Does he prohibit private businesses operating in TX from mandating masks?
1868,What a fool.
1869,He will turn Texas blue yet
1870,I briefly skimmed the article but without knowing how many of those people 882 are “those living in Massachusetts” the 74% is a useless statistic.
1871,"For example if of these 882, 400 of were living in Massachusetts that would be 300 people that were fully vaccinated and coughs the virus."
1872,If on the other hand only 32 of those 882 were those living in Massachusetts then the number would be 24 people instead of 300 that were full vaccinated and caught the virus.
1873,Some days I wish I lived in Texas.
1874,"Honestly this is awesome, and should be national."
1875,"Any American wanting the vaccine, can have it."
1876,"Any who are at risk and don't get it, oh fucking well."
1877,It's as if there's a concerted effort to prolong this ordeal.
1878,Oh yeah.
1879,My family accidentally ended up as part of a gay pride parade when I got lost trying to drive us to the beach before cellphones were big.
1880,Somewhat traumatic having everyone assume my mom was my partner.
1881,Gov Brian Kemp will be soon too.
1882,He's already blasting the Atlanta mayor for mandating masks indoors.
1883,"Oh, and all the while the Governor's Mansion has been closed since March 2020."
1884,I think it's completely irresponsible for a non-scientist to make these types of decisions.
1885,This is the reason we are still in this pandemic.
1886,Thanks buddy.

1966,Correct.
1967,So the vaccine reduces the spread by at least 75-85 percent.
1968,"When people say “vaccinated people spread covid at the same rate,” that is referring only to breakthrough infections *and* even that is not proven."

1973,we need lots more data on everything but we're still in the middle of a pandemic.
1974,"the vaccines work, and they seem to work pretty well, at least from the standpoint of not being hospitalized or death, which is a pretty big deal."
1975,"finally, a governor with sense."
1976,The important thing I’ve been seeing is the vaccine is less effective against the Delta variant.
1977,"It is still a good way to avoid dying, but it does not seem like a good way to prevent infection on its own."
1978,I hope masks can return along with other restrictions to help slow the spread.
1979,I’m not so much worried about delta but what could be coming after delta.

1983,"“What’s even more remarkable about the 1918 flu, say infectious disease experts, is that it never really went away."
1984,"After infecting an estimated 500 million people worldwide in 1918 and 1919 (a third of the global population), the H1N1 strain that caused the Spanish flu receded into the background and stuck around as the regular seasonal flu."
1985,"But every so often, direct descendants of the 1918 flu combined with bird flu or swine flu to create powerful new pandemic strains, which is exactly what happened in 1957, 1968 and 2009."
1986,"Those later flu outbreaks, all created in part by the 1918 virus, claimed millions of additional lives, earning the 1918 flu the odious title of “the mother of all pandemics.”

https://www.history.com/news/1918-flu-pandemic-never-ended

“The Spanish flu hit in the fall of 1918; a second surge occurred from January to April 1919, and a smaller one followed in the winter of 1920."
1987,"Forty million people died from the flu, including 550,000-750,000 Americans."
1988,We later learned that the flu was the H1N1 strain of influenza.
1989,"Secondary bacterial pneumonia was often the cause of death at that time.”

https://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/940788

“Academics agree that the end of the pandemic occurred in 1920, when society ended up developing a collective immunity to the Spanish flu, although the virus never completely disappeared.”

2029,Thanks for sharing your experience
2030,Something that should be pointed out is that a lot of people aren't getting it because they don't believe its free.
2031,Our healthcare system has trained people to think there will be a hidden cost.
2032,This tracks as there is a pretty good correlation between unvax and no health insurance.
2033,Probably means they should be advertising its free way way more.
2034,Then it was an incredibly stupid event.
2035,Literally guaranteed that people there wouldn’t be protected unless they were time travelers.

2071,She traveled to California thinking the vaccine would protect her.
2072,Her friend who traveled with her bought into the conspiracy theories and didn’t get her vaccine.
2073,She ended up being the vector and gave it to her.
2074,"Im absolutely furious and want to call her friend and give her a serious piece of my mind, but I’m not going to do that."
2075,It’ll just make the situation worse.
2076,Yup.
2077,Covid lockdowns part 2.
2078,&gt;Did you read what I was commenting on?
2079,People who didn’t take the vaccine are hospitalized with COVID and now realize how serious it is since it’s affecting them personally and regret not getting the vaccine.
2080,"So, are you suggesting i be emphatic towards them for their decision to not get vaccinated?"
2081,What is your point?
2082,&gt;	The information about the danger is out there and it’s already affected millions of people.
2083,If you’re vaccinated there really is no danger.
2084,&gt;The point is that some people understand this by seeing others go through it and some people don’t seem capable of comprehending it until they’re in the hospital themselves and on their deathbed.
2085,"But again, what dies that have to do with me?"
2086,Deaths from covid have resuced 10 fold and are comparable to similar numbers we see from the seasonal flu each year.
2087,Do you get this hysterical every flu season as well and claim people not getting their flu shot are putting your life in danger or do you carry on with your life?

2100,Trump is ALREADY running for 2024.
2101,And anyone else that runs on a GOP ticket for 2024 may as well not even waste their money.
2102,The state governments are directly overpowering cities to prevent them from saving lives.
2103,This is exactly what the small-government people said they feared the federal government doing to the states.
2104,Not sure if I'm taking crazy pills but yeah why is everyone so worried about kids dying from Covid now?
2105,The risk of under 18s unvaccinated dying from Covid is insanely low.

2122,"It's ""hilarious"" how effectively the government works to enact this legislation."
2123,"The U.S. government can't really ""punish misinformation"" since even made-up bullshit is protected by the 1st amendment."
2124,And do we really want the government deciding and enforcing what's true or not?
2125,That's a really slippery slope.
2126,"And you're right, like I said, vaccinated people can probably still transmit the virus, but it's much more rare than transmission by unvaccinated people."
2127,"The unvaccinated are a much greater threat to their communities, themselves, and vaccinated people than vice versa."
2128,"When 90+ % of Covid hospitalizations and deaths at this point are unvaccinated people, it's not really the fault of vaccinated people if cases spike and hospitals are filling up."
2129,The amount of transmission and overall community harm we can blame vaccinated people for is probably stupidly negligible compared to the unvaccinated.
2130,"The proportion of vaccinated people who even get infected when exposed is significantly lower than those who are unvaccinated, and among those infected, their viral load is likely reduced to some extent."
2131,"The exact extent is complicated by the Delta variant, but with previous variants transmission by vaccinated people was basically nonexistent even in breakthrough cases because of a low viral load."
2132,"As far as I'm aware, there's no actual documentation of vaccinated people spreading the virus at all, and the new CDC guidance was made solely because the Delta variant appears to cause extremely high viral loads in the nasopharynx, which is enough to say we should probably heir on the side of caution."
2133,"To say that non-mask-wearing vaccinated people are at all significantly responsible for the situation we are currently in when half the country roams around unvaccinated and unmasked, though?"
2134,I think that's completely ridiculous.
2135,The answer is and will never be - give up.
2136,This would ruin society.
2137,People would further be torn apart.
2138,We would also learn nothing for next time.
2139,The only feasible effort is the one that would solve the problem.
2140,"Just because the problem is big, doesn't mean we can't solve it."
2141,"We have much bigger problems than covid, so we need the practice."
2142,"But to answer, the solution is a worldwide effort to stop the spread and get people vaccinated."
2143,We can plan for it.
2144,Pick some random day.
2145,How about June 1st 2022.
2146,"On that day, we will implement a 2-3 week worldwide lockdown."
2147,People will be prepared.
2148,Vaccines will be distributed.
2149,"Upon return, every single person will wear a mask in public."
2150,"Beyond this, an entire new industry of contact tracing will arrive."
2151,This will include apps and call centers.
2152,"And don't get me wrong, people won't like this, but it would provide two critical things."
2153,1st - how to organize a worldwide effort (It's needed now and in the future).
2154,2nd - it will bring humanity together.
2155,So fuck this - what can be done.
2156,Almost nothing organized has been done.

2166,Agreed CDC needs to be completely apolitical.
2167,The Austin area this article is referencing encompasses 13 counties so while travis county (where Austin is located) has a higher Vax rate the surrounding more rural counties don’t.
2168,When the hospitals in the smaller counties run out of beds Austin (or any major city in Texas) take the surplus.

2241,People need to stop politicizing heath care and pressuring the CDC to announce guidelines that are politically expedient instead of what's going to save the most lives.
2242,I really had a hard time believing this report that is why I kept searching for why they would use such a small sample and basically declare that 70% of vaccinated people contacted the delta strain.
2243,Now it all makes sense…
2244,It took about a few months for Remdesevir and other antivirals to become the norm.
2245,They were still testing things like Hydroxychloroquine in the early months.
2246,The hospitals were also completely unprepared for the early onslaught with things like PPE.
2247,"Also, I think they were intubating too early the first couple months which lead to complications."

2265,"When that number gets high, then that's something to worry about."
2266,How are we not tracking that by age group in every single state?
2267,Wouldn't that be the most important information you could have when your vaccinated ass leaves the house or when it is too scared to leave and is seeking some reassurance about vaccinations?
2268,Or when you're not yet vaccinated and want to see hard numbers about what you're avoiding by being vaccinated?
2269,I'm not sure what the point of all this is if it's this difficult to get solid #'s on breakthrough infections in children under 12 that lead to hospitalization as well as total breakthrough infections that lead to hospitalization.

2276,"The instructions go in, they teach your cells what to do, and it dissolves away leaving your own body with fresh training of how to fight covid."
2277,"Correct me if I'm wrong, but I can't find a *single* example in the history of medicine where ""long-term"" side effects appeared more than 8 or 9 weeks after vaccination."
2278,We now have millions of people well past that threshold doing just fine.
2279,There are a couple one-in-several-million long-term effects being actively studied (good!
2280,science!
2281,"), but there's not going to be some mass die-off or infertility of 1B people worldwide."
2282,There just isn't.
2283,I literally had a sore throat I could effectively ignore.
2284,Pfizer and natural immunity.
2285,"I don't expect to never get COVID again, but I expect that I won't be able to discern it from a common cold."
2286,In the US no.

2292,"second wave was summer, which wasn't bad in the northeast at all, including NJ."
2293,3rd wave started in fall and went through winter- that's likely the one you were thinking of.
2294,Deathrate was way down for subsequent waves
2295,"Never had a flu start with stomach problems and then give me headaches days later, nor life-sapping fatigue *without* fever/chills a day after a short acute illness."
2296,"My partner had a mild case of the dumbs for a few days as well, which is not flu-like."
2297,"If it wasn't covid, it was a very, very weird illness that strongly resembled it."
2298,I just had this strong sense while I was experiencing the acute infection that this is what I was vaccinated for.
2299,"It was exactly like my post-vaccine symptoms, but a degree removed, like I already had the better of it."
2300,Can I guarantee it was covid?
2301,"No, but I just know."
2302,"That's not going to be a popular sentiment in a science-based subreddit, but it is what it is."
2303,"This is a lesson in irresponsible, yellow journalism."
2304,All passengers over 16 on the boat are required to be vaccinated.
2305,The headline hints that there were many other unvaxxed passengers who didn’t get it when I’m reality all of the unvaxxed ones would have to be under 16 and were likely a minority of people.
2306,Who would work at Walmart if there were no stupid people around?
2307,I told this before but I really don't understand the politicization of masks in the US.
2308,"It is a pandemic cause by an airborne agent, wearing mask is one of the easiest way to protect yourself unless you want it to be spreading."
2309,"My wife convinced me to get it so I don’t spread it to the kids... well now I can still spread it to the kids, and others... so now what?"
2310,"I work from home anyway, and don’t really go anywhere but I can see why it’s an issue for most people."
2311,What are you talking about?
2312,"Texas has one of the strongest economies in the nation and California businesses, fleeing draconian business laws there, are flocking to Tx."
2313,I agree Prying.
2314,We really need to know how many went to indoor clubs during that time.
2315,BEAR WEEK 2021 was the week of July 10th (included in the outbreak period).
2316,"If it was ANYTHING like my Bear Week experience in 2018, it is 100% not a normal comparison to real life and your day-to-day indoor spaces."
2317,It was like going to a packed concert on steroids.
2318,Club Purgatory hosted 5 bear week parties the week of Jul 10.
2319,I attended an underwear party there in 2018 and I have never felt more claustrophobic in my life.
2320,It was in a stuffy basement with low ceilings.
2321,"The people were very liberal to stay the least, and tbh it was dangerously overpacked."
2322,You couldn’t move.
2323,"It was hot, sweaty and I could barely breathe with all the sweat and BO in the air."
2324,"Looking back with post-pandemic goggles, it was the single most “high risk” experience I could imagine going to (and I go to EDM shows and concerts)."
2325,I needed to use my inhaler standing in that room and at the time I remember looking at the basement windows thinking that’s how I would break out if there was an emergency because people would have been trampled.

2337,"You should be hiding, locked in your houses."
2338,The virus kills .003% of people!
2339,Delta has nothing to do with Vax or not.
2340,Everyone has already gotten the virus in New Jersey.
2341,I am not sure what point you are making.
2342,You are the one lying.. New Jersey has the highest per capita death rate of any state.
2343,Much higher death rate than Florida or Texas.
2344,You guys did the worst and yet you are patting yourself on the back.
2345,My state has about half of the New Jersey Death rate and even now you have twice as many cases per capita than my state.
2346,I am not sure why people are upvoting your lies.
2347,"No, it's a true vaccine."
2348,The Flu vaccine doesn't guarantee you never get the flu.
2349,"Heck, no vaccine guarantees anything."
2350,"Such a dumb take, sorry man."
2351,Everything is about reducing spread vectors.
2352,"If a vaccine + social distancing + masks = 10x less likely to get infected, then the disease spreads exponentially less."
2353,"The slower it spreads, the longer we have to develop a proper cure or a more effective vaccine."
2354,Look at flu vaccines 20 years ago vs today.
2355,"20 years ago they did pretty much nothing, today they're VERY effective (but still not perfect because of the high mutation rate)."
2356,out of curiosity - do your children take flu shots?
2357,&gt; There's no reason to expect any weird symptoms years down the line.
2358,It doesn't work like HIV or chicken pox.
2359,I've not seen anything that shows that COVID-19 does not have latent effects.
2360,"In fact, the research cited here shows that some research shows it could."
2361,"https://www.aljazeera.com/features/2020/4/12/doctors-note-can-the-coronavirus-reactivate

So to claim it ""doesn't work like ____"" would be nice to have some research I can read to understand a little more about it."
2362,"A mask doesn't help you not catch it, they help prevent people from spreading it."
2363,"I'm vaccinated, I'm fine."
2364,Haaaaave you seen the people who frequent Disney tho
2365,No one has a delta specific shot.
2366,"https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.07.19.452771v1

Basically, very poor neutralizing antibody titers in those vaccinated with JnJ vs 2 doses of mRNA."
2367,It's likely that people are going to be receiving a third mRNA dose during this outbreak as well because even 2 mRNA doses are not good enough to stop delta.
2368,"It wasn't 11 players, it was 11 people in the organization including at least 1 player (Trea Turner, who is now a Dodger)."
2369,"No, mandate vaccines so those idiots protect others accidentally!"
2370,"So when people aren’t vaccinated, it’s a huge issue."
2371,"When they are fully vaccinated, as the CDC says… then it’s just a small sample size, nothing to worry about."
2372,You folks really are brain dead and blind.
2373,"I've read plenty, what's your point"
2374,"The thing is, though, if we're going to keep tracking ALL breakthroughs, which Gottlieb is now saying the CDC should do, and all we're going to focus on is positive #'s and not hospitalizations among the vaccinated and those who can not yet be vaccinated (children under 12), then what's the point?"
2375,Part of the problem is that the narrative has shifted from fear of death and hospitalization to fear that COVID won't be stamped out completely.
2376,I don't remember ever once thinking it would be wiped out while waiting for my first and second shot.
2377,"do think it was intelligent of the CDC to only track breakthrough hospitalizations because total positives freaks people out and makes for an all too easy out among the anti-vaxxers, no matter how ridiculous it may seem."
2378,"Israel is also still trying to make life as normal as possible, with indoor masking and vaccine passports."
2379,"An event like what happened in Provincetown could still take place in Israel, so this really doesn't change anything."
2380,Right - and that's great.
2381,Might be out of their paycheck though.
2382,/s
2383,What do u expect from someone who has 5 kids in this time
2384,That is just the official number.
2385,"The excess deaths are estimated to be an additional 400,000 people who either died with COVID but were not coded as such, died of COVID without being tested, died after recovering from COVID, or died due to complications of other diseases due, it is hypothesized, to lapses in care or monitoring early in the pandemic."
2386,"I had what the doctor then called ""post viral fatigue"" after having mono."
2387,It took me a good 2 years to feel really better and 20 years later I still get bouts of fatigue.
2388,"I'm glad post viral symptoms are being taken more seriously now than they were then, people thought I was just faking it."
2389,"I'm fully vaccinated but ""long covid"" still concerns me, I don't want to go through that again."
2390,"Sounds like a bit of a turd, especially with the second part of the article about sexual abuse."
2391,That's great if this were spread evenly across the country.
2392,It's not.
2393,"In some states the % of older adults vaccinated is over 95%; in others, it's around 40%."
2394,"FYI it's pre weeb - it's from [Irish mythology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geas), then it gained steam in early tabletop RPGs before making its way to anime."

2397,And both can be hit by a meteor.
2398,What's your point?
2399,We're talking hundreds of millions of cases.
2400,"With that much noise, everything happens, and any conclusion needs to be a probability backed by solid, well-thought-out statistics."
2401,"Not ""I found 5 people to which X happened in this group of exposed of which I have no idea what it looks like""."
2402,"I understand that this is worrying news, I don't like it myself."
2403,"But it's not a study, and no conclusion beyond ""we should look at (or create) a study about this"" should be drawn from it."
2404,Who is we?
2405,"The whole point, since the beginning, was to keep you out of the hospital."
2406,"If you thought a 94% efficacy rate vs main strain, and 66% efficacy vs Delta variant meant the pandemic was over for you, that's on you brother."
2407,Officials also didn't expect this level of vaccine hesitancy.
2408,"If we were at 70%+ inoculation then yes, the pandemic is over for you if you're vaccinated."
2409,"In fact, in places where these targets are met, there is no pandemic...

Look at nations like New Zealand."
2410,No issues.
2411,"What’s different about delta for kids, aside from its infectiousness?"
2412,"Ugh these vaccines for under 12 can’t come soon enough, I’ll be among the first in line with my kids"
2413,You can get infected just by passing by someone with covid in a corridor.
2414,The Delta variant is that infectious.
2415,I'd keep my mask if I was you.
2416,The 1000x claim is from a study in china and involved about 60 people with Delta compared to the very first wave .
2417,"That's insanely insignificant statistically and well it's from China, we need a lot more published data but the media ran with it anyway as they always do"
2418,They were worse in the second wave too.
2419,Facts getting downvoted.
2420,New Jersey is about the worst place in the world for COVID.
2421,And except the Northwest Corner I would want to be in New Jersey.
2422,So what.
2423,More people either will get vaccinated or won’t go.
2424,The few that try to fake a card what can you do.
2425,It’s no reason to not require it.
2426,"Interesting stuff, I appreciate the links."
2427,I still think it's not exactly a doomsday scenario.
2428,"From the comments you linked:

&gt;To put it in perspective, the study had a sample size of 1497 fully vaccinated healthcare workers."
2429,39 breakthrough infections were documented in the sample.
2430,"Of all the breakthrough infections, 7 developed long COVID."
2431,"Numbers like ""19% of vaccinated people are developing long term symptoms"" sound really alarming, but the base rate of people even getting COVID is quite small."
2432,"Also, long-COVID can mean a lot of different things to a lot of different people."
2433,"I had a horrible cold in fall of 2019, with symptoms lasting from mid-November through to mid-January."
2434,"It sucked and I hated it, but it's certainly not the same thing as the tiny minority of people who are experiencing symptoms 6-12 months after infection."
2435,In this case the study defines long-COVID as still having at least one symptom after 6 weeks.
2436,In some cases I've even seen it defined as still having at least one symptom after 3 weeks.
2437,"I want to be clear here, I'm not arguing that we should open 'er up and throw caution to the wind, merely that young, healthy, vaccinated people on this subreddit who feel like the walls are closing in on them can probably relax just a little bit."
2438,The UK could be a different case because of the later second doses.
2439,Completely agree.
2440,Workplace infections will definitely exceed classroom infections.
2441,You give another example of this country prioritizing workplace culture over public safety.
2442,This country is comoletely fucked if the mindset doesn't change soon.

They were not."

2460,"“If I had the information I have today we would have gotten vaccinated,” Ms. Greene wrote."
2461,"Come what may, she hit “send.”
Amid a resurgence of coronavirus infections and deaths, some people who once rejected the vaccine or simply waited too long are now grappling with the consequences, often in raw, public ways."
2462,"A number are speaking from hospital beds, at funerals and in obituaries about their regrets, about the pain of enduring the virus and watching unvaccinated family members die gasping for breath."
2463,"“I have such incredible guilt,” Ms. Greene said one morning as she sat in the fourth-floor lobby outside the I.C.U."

2465,“I blame myself still.
2466,"Every day.”
The recent surge of infections and hospitalizations among unvaccinated people has brought the grim realities of Covid-19 crashing home for many who thought they had skirted the pandemic."
2467,"But now, with anger and fatigue piled up on all sides, the question is whether their stories can actually change any minds."
2468,"Some people hospitalized with the virus still vow not to get vaccinated, and surveys suggest that the majority of unvaccinated Americans are not budging."
2469,Doctors in Covid units say some patients still refuse to believe they are infected with anything beyond the flu.
2470,“We have people in the I.C.U.
2471,"with Covid who are denying they have Covid,” said Dr. Matthew Sperry, a pulmonary critical care physician who has been treating Mr. Greene."
2472,"“It doesn’t matter what we say.”
Covid hospitalizations in Utah have risen 35 percent over the past two weeks, and Dr. Sperry said intensive care units across the 24-hospital system where he works are 98 percent full."
2473,"Still, some hospitals swamped with patients in largely conservative, unvaccinated swaths of the country have begun to recruit Covid survivors as public health messengers of last resort."
2474,"The hope is that onetime skeptics might just persuade others who dismissed vaccination campaigns led by President Biden, Dr. Anthony Fauci and armies of local doctors and health workers."
2475,"Theirs are Scared Straight stories for a pandemic that has thrived on misinformation, fear and hardened partisan divisions over whether or not to get vaccinated."
2476,"“People are creating news from their hospital beds, from the wards,” said Rebecca Weintraub, an assistant professor of global health and social medicine at Harvard Medical School."
2477,“It’s the accessibility of the message: ‘I didn’t protect my own family.
2478,"Let me help you protect yours.’”
In Springfield, Mo., where coronavirus cases spiked this summer, Russell Taylor sat in a hospital gown, an oxygen cannula draped across his face, to offer a pro-vaccine testimonial in a hospital video."
2479,"“I don’t see how I could not get it now,” he said."
2480,A Texas man who underwent a double-lung transplant after contracting the virus made a plea on local television for others to get vaccinated.
2481,"And in a shaking voice, a hospital-clinic administrator in rural Utah described how she had been pummeled by double pneumonia and sepsis after choosing not to get vaccinated."
2482,"The woman, Stormy, said it had taken weeks to summon the nerve to speak out in a video posted by her local health department."
2483,She only did so using her first name because she worried that Covid deniers would say she was making it all up.
2484,"“I absolutely was fearful of the negative aspects that could come from it,” she said in an interview this week."
2485,"“I was part of a problem that I was trying to avoid.”
Some people who were quick to embrace the vaccine are now choosing to speak out about family members who did not."
2486,"It was a role Kimberle Jones never wanted, but one she embraced after her daughter, Erica Thompson, 37, a mother from St. Louis, died on July 4, nearly three months after she had what she thought was a bad asthma attack."
2487,"“I want to be a voice for her,” said Ms. Jones, who got vaccinated as soon as she was able to."
2488,"“I really think my daughter would want me to say, ‘Go get vaccinated.’”
It was advice Ms. Thompson — like some 39 percent of American adults — did not heed."
2489,Her mother said Ms. Thompson had been leery of how quickly the Moderna and Pfizer vaccines had rolled out — the culmination of decades of scientific research.
2490,"She also believed the government-run campaign was a plot against Black people like her, according to her mother."
2491,"Vaccination rates for Black and Hispanic Americans lag behind the white population, a gap that researchers attribute to distrust rooted in a history of medical discrimination and a lack of access and outreach."
2492,"After scraping by making $10 an hour at call-center jobs, Ms. Thompson had recently found a dream job doing medical coding."
2493,She went to the hospital coughing and struggling to breathe in mid-May and was on a ventilator within days.
2494,Ms. Jones said she sang “Beat It” as her daughter was sedated and promised to be there when she woke.
2495,"“Her last words to me were, ‘Mama I can’t breathe,’” Ms. Jones said."
2496,"In Utah, Ms. Greene said her husband had left the family’s vaccination decisions in her hands."
2497,"She initially planned to get the shot as soon as her next-door neighbor, a physician, got his."
2498,"But she had concerns about the vaccine, and found plenty of reasons to hesitate when she scrolled through social media or talked with anti-vaccine friends."
2499,"“You need to watch this,” one wrote to her."
2500,"Clicking on a few links took her down a rabbit hole of conspiracy theories touted by anti-vaccine attorneys and YouTubers, and videos in which anti-vaccine doctors and nurses decried the Covid-19 shots as “bioweapons.”
Covid crashed into the family’s world in late June when their two oldest sons brought the virus home from a church camp where nine boys got infected."
2501,The virus swept through the family.
2502,"Then came the day that Mr. Greene, a hunter who hiked across mountains, had to be rushed to the hospital when his oxygen levels cratered."
2503,"Now, they measure time in “Covid days.” Ms. Greene wakes up dry heaving many mornings."
2504,"Her four children — ages 8 to 18 — stay home while she visits the hospital, unable to tell their dad about dance class or smashing a hit deep into the outfield during a baseball game."
2505,There are uncertain months ahead as doctors try to repair Mr. Greene’s damaged lungs and wean him off a ventilator.
2506,"He was briefly transferred from the hospital to a long-term acute care center last week, a hopeful moment."
2507,"But doctors found a hole in his lungs, and he was rushed back into the intensive care unit."
2508,"“I will always regret that I listened to the misinformation being put out there,” Ms. Greene said."
2509,"“They’re creating fear.”
Even after Mr. Greene was put on a ventilator in early July, vaccine skeptics Ms. Greene knew texted her links to misinformation about fertility and hidden vaccine deaths."

2515,"Now, church friends and neighbors bring dinners by the house and send updates to the congregation about Mr. Greene."
2516,"Ms. Greene begins her hospital visits with a spiritual reading and ends each night by gathering their children — Hunter, 18; Easton, 15; Betty, 13, and Rushton, 8 — to talk about their father and the prayers he needs."
2517,Her views shifted as the virus ravaged her husband’s body and doctors put him on a ventilator.

2549,Might be a huge boon to business as well.

2559,The vaccines are effective and safe.
2560,"""Wait and see"" is no longer an excuse."
2561,I think much of the confusion in recent discussions comes from the lack of making a proper distinction between being susceptible to infection versus being able to transmit it to others once infected.
2562,"What is safe to say, even with delta, is that vaccinated people are much less susceptible to catching the virus than unvaxxed people."
2563,But there is still some uncertainty on whether an infected vaccinated person is just as likely to pass the virus on as an infected unvaxxed person.
2564,"But if you are young and healthy ...

Don't know how often I've heard this."
2565,It's outdated anyway.
2566,"Thanks for sharing, they reference the CDC who make some estimates without providing any data and also state this:

“asymptomatic cases are difficult to identify and transmission is difficult to observe and quantify.”

I wouldn't put too much weight into this."
2567,"When did treatments come out, when did vaccines come out."
2568,13 and 2 yrs old.
2569,whew that's a weird gap to navigate
2570,Ok that’s what I thought.
2571,Just clarifying on your wording.
2572,Thank you
2573,Good
2574,All I meant was that we can't know what the virus itself or the vaccines are going to do just because we've seen what they have done up to now.
2575,They don’t believe in evolution
2576,&gt; by telling vaccinated (read:PROTECTED) people to live as if there's no vaccine.
2577,It's not that simple.
2578,The vaccine *vastly* reduces your risk of serious symptoms or death.
2579,We've figured out that the new Delta variant can be spread by vaccinated people too.
2580,"The population is still at risk, even if you only care about those who can't get the vaccine."
2581,"Yeah I keep seeing people saying “just get your shots, it’s so easy!” and I want to laugh in their faces."
2582,"Those shots take a while to do anything, there just absolutely isn’t time to vaccinate our way out of what’s about to happen in the coming weeks even if people wanted to do it"
2583,That’s not the problem.
2584,The problem is letting the unvaccinated mingling with the vaccinated in society.
2585,All indoor institutions should require vaccinations
2586,Our current approach is fine.
2587,Vax up.
2588,Mask up.
2589,Protect the vulnerable until they have the option of the shot.
2590,Once the kids have had a square chance at their jab then you can go all defeatist and suck on a covid straw if you want to.
2591,Before that society's righteous path is to cast out those who choose to be unclean and so threaten the innocent.
2592,But they are happening on the sly.
2593,A friend (U.S.) who’d gotten the  J&amp;J recently got a Phizer.
2594,Never change America never change
2595,Don't get vaccinated.
2596,It hasn't been tested for 10 years.
2597,Take Hydroxychloroquine with Zinc instead.
2598,"""that was just saline the deepstate made him do it!"""
2599,What do we think will happen with Covid in the U.S over the next couple of months?
2600,I wonder how far upwards cases will surge until they come back down again.
2601,"Might we trace the same pattern the UK is seeing, where cases drop back off in a couple of weeks?"
2602,Will new variants ever end?
2603,"I'm finally ready to move out and go to college in-person next month, and the new surge really worries me, both for my health and the possibility that restrictions will go back in place and I'll lose even more of this important time in my life."
2604,"AFAIK, no, it’s still low and a small percentage."
2605,As far as I saw.
2606,"That's a good joke, but at this point, it is about my health and safety."
2607,I need to know who to keep a special distance from.
2608,"If they are not identified to me, how will I know?"
2609,I feel like the nurses who've worked in the COVID wards probably aren't anti-vaxxers.
2610,It'd be too hard to see what the virus is capable of on a daily basis and still think a vaccine was worse.
2611,Especially after 100 million or more Americans had a take it and were still walking about just fine.
2612,Let evolution take care of them.
2613,This is how all markets work.
2614,That's so weird.
2615,No way!
2616,It’s almost as if poor education has something to do with it

2626,Now from my perspective it seems there's a 50/50 split in this community over whether things are going to get bad again or not and it seems were all pro vaccine so that's unlikely the reason.

2640,"People, both the unvaccinated and most of the fully vaccinated who took the pandemic seriously, will laugh if authorities try to push a ""Zoom Thanksgiving/Christmas"" at this point."
2641,No one outside of Reddit and Redditor circles wants to go through another 2020 with the vaccine around and working.
2642,*But muh delta*
2643,"(a) you missed my point which is that 30% of society are anti vax and not it with us

(b) getting a case doesn't matter if you don't get hospitalized or die."
2644,That's what the vaccine prevents at amazing rates.
2645,"Less than 1,000 of 162,000,000 vaccinated Americans have died."
2646,(c) only 400 kids have died from Covid in 18 months.
2647,That's flu season levels risk (aka in line with the risk we've been willing to assume to live our lives for decades.
2648,it’s insane that these nut jobs have politicized vaccination against a world wide pandemic.
2649,conservatives are truly the lowest humanity has to offer
2650,How much do you like your grandma?
2651,"In pure economic terms, there is a reason you should miss out the $100: your willingness to vaccinate was higher."
2652,You didn't need these incentives to get vaccinated because the benefit you saw in getting vaccinated was non-monetary.
2653,The holdouts now have something that society wants: progress toward herd immunity.
2654,"That is valuable to you and me; and, intrinsically, they hold supplier power toward herd immunity."
2655,"Put differently, no ""rational"" person would offer to pay for something they were going to receive regardless."

2711,Certain politicians also want to kill their own base to own Biden and show how bad he is doing.
2712,"Well, just keep going at it then."
2713,The vaccines still protect from hospitalization and death right?
2714,So I don’t see how we would be back at square one or anything.
2715,Just think if Asshole Orange had gotten his shot publicly.
2716,Just think.
2717,"Well this time last year a lot of people were staying home so I imagine this year is the ""normal"" one and last year had exceptionally low rates of non-covid hospitalization because of fewer car accidents, fewer bar fights, work accidents, etc."
2718,"Also a lot of people who might go to the Dr for mild illnesses chose not to go last year to avoid covid, so doing things like trying to deal with the flue or minor injuries at home instead."
2719,"&gt; Every time a new variant inevitably pops up, we’ll go ahead and waste more years of our lives with restrictions DESPITE THE ENTIRE POINT OF THE VACCINE????"
2720,We haven't gotten enough people vaccinated yet.

2722,And let Darwin Settle the tab.

2724,fine.
2725,we can take the money we get from cuba for selling florida and texas to them and use it to move the rest of the midwest city folks to the coasts.
2726,Time will help too.
2727,If people don't understand the process of science or how scientists come to their conclusions or have poor judgement in choosing leaders.
2728,Putting yourself in their shoes I can see why the miraculously quick vaccine development could be suspicious.
2729,Those who have very little understanding of science and the world would understandably be scared.
2730,"The kind of people who only trust the simple things they can see before them, may eventually be comforted that all the vaccinated people survived."

2736,"That’s what I’m saying, most of this ain’t new information and yet people are tripping over themselves like this going to lead to our extinction."
2737,It’s weird
2738,The US probably has a larger proportion with previous infection which would have a similar effect to vaccination.
2739,US vaccinated + non-vaccinated prior infections is probably close to UK.
2740,But who knows.
2741,We do tend to trail UK in these spikes.
2742,This still seems in line with the reduced vaccine efficacy that was already made abundantly clear when delta first started getting going.
2743,And 7 hospitalizations out of hundreds of breakthrough cases really doesn't sound like a doomsday scenario.
2744,Still a far cry from useless.
2745,And yet we have people worried about the vaccines long term effects.

2765,Dude.
2766,I wasn’t making a comparison.
2767,The person I was replying to is obviously feeling down about the new information we’ve been getting so I was trying to be supportive.
2768,Nowhere in my post did I say that it’s *darker than last year* or whatever.
2769,"The latest news isn’t great though, a lot of people aren’t feeling good about it, and dismissing those anxieties isn’t a great thing to do either as opposed to acknowledging those anxieties and encouraging them to keep their chin up."
2770,"Not if they don't have a lot of money, family nearby, custody issues, an industry based in their area, etc."
2771,I certainly hope so
2772,You should be concerned.

2796,I think you are underplaying the role of the EU quite a bit.
2797,The vaccines are approved by a European Medicine Agency.
2798,"Which is required for market authorization in the EU (countries can also additionally do their own market authorization, but as far as I can tell, only Hungary has chosen to do so)."
2799,"Pfizer/Biontech, Moderna, AZ and J&amp;J didn't apply in Berlin, Paris, or Madrid."
2800,"They went through EMA, gave them all their documentation and had their production sites approved by EMA."
2801,"No Danish, Portugese or German government official had to go to Marburg to approve Biontech's production process."
2802,The rollout and priorization is done by each member state and each state can also add their own recommendation.

2819,Mainly in regards to which vaccine appears most suited against Delta?
2820,"I’m aware that any vaccine is a good vaccine, but I keep seeing that Pfizer’s isn’t having the greatest time in Israel right now."
2821,Is moderna the better option?
2822,Or J&amp;J?
2823,I know there can’t be much on the subject right now but I intended to get the Pfizer and now I’m seeing it’s apparently getting it’s ass kicked by Delta

2851,I'm surprised this isn't more strict...
2852,Even at local (base) levels.
2853,Military commanders have almost absolute power over the people who enter their installations.
2854,If I were a base commander I'd have mandated that all people entering the base be vaccinated (when possible) months ago.
2855,99% of adults that ever step foot on military installations should be vaccinated.
2856,"It's a force protection measure, and very reasonable."
2857,I had to take mandatory vaccinations every year (and at other specific times) in the military.
2858,Every command should be cycling troops through mandatory vaccinations followed by a day or two off for side effects.

2864,?
2865,Hope you're better soon.
2866,Cloth masks?
2867,"Yeah, probably not."
2868,N95 or greater is probably the only thing that will still offer any sort of protection with something as infectious as Delta.
2869,"The issue is the much greater viral load, which is what masks typically reduced."
2870,"Now it's so great that unless you have a properly fitted N95/KN95, you're most likely not getting any protection whatsoever."
2871,"I'm surprised the CDC hasn't specified this, but it could be so we don't have another shortage."

2874,"Imagine how much worse this would have been without mask mandates and social distancing, stay at home orders etc..."
2875,You don't want to catch COVID.
2876,Also if the vaccinated can catch and transmit COVID you can't get out of this pandemic.
2877,It's not \*just\* hospitalization that you have to worry about.
2878,And if new data our of Israel is to be beleived it's down to 80% against serious infection.

2883,"Yeah, I'm getting my second shot next week, have been looking forward to it hoping that i'll be able to travel and see my loved ones so really disheartening to hear this."
2884,Many of the comments you see are probably astroturfed accounts deliberately pushing this outcome.
2885,What scares me is that I think it worked.
2886,Social media disinformation is effectively being used to damage US standing by making the country eat itself alive.
2887,Antivaxx propaganda being utter-nonsense yet spreading rampantly is one of the biggest pieces of proof of this.
2888,Delata can pass through fleeting contact and is more transmissble outside.
2889,Casees in New Zealand and I think Australia have shown this.
2890,The biggest problem we have here is that the CDC refuses to operate on global information until it smack them in the face.
2891,It's why removing the mask mandate was so bad.
2892,Anybody who was paying attention to anything other than the US outbreak knew how this was going to end.
2893,Umm... Should I be worried?
2894,I'm already at anxiety max.
2895,"Hey, at least you didn't do all that stuff and then still get covid after getting vaccinated... for now"
2896,[removed]
2897,"Still doesn't mean much, the vaccination campaign is managed by each member state with a different drug authority."
2898,"I always cringe a bit with these US vs. EU comparison to be honest, not just in regards to vaccines."
2899,"The value of putting Denmark, Portugal and Bulgaria in the same figure is beyond me."
2900,They really need to provide more money for this kind of monitoring.
2901,Some of the researchers involved in this work were interviewed on TWIV and said that they are always at risk of funds being cut off.
2902,"Meanwhile, if new mutations are happening in other animals and have the chance for spillback, we need to know."
2903,What stops poor people getting vaccinated multiple times for more money?
2904,"It’s not “recommended” for under 50 because shingles has been so rare in young people, however that is changing faster than the guidance on when to get it."
2905,You can ask your doctor to give it to you but they may decline because of the guidance so it might take convincing and or shopping around.
2906,"It also might help to have a story about why you want it early, like a family history of shingles before that age or something."
2907,"Doctors can prescribe outside of the FDA recommendations, it’s not illegal for them to do it or anything, but if you had a severe reaction to the vaccine they might be liable for going outside of guidelines and might make you sign extra forms as a result."
2908,Also note that in the US the vaccine is quite expensive and won’t be covered by insurance if you can even get the doctor to do it because of the FDA recommendations.
2909,"&gt;After all, this variant came from India, where the vaccination rate is very very low."
2910,The variant was first observed back in December of 2020 in India.
2911,"Around that time, vaccinations were just starting in the Western world."
2912,India hadn't even approved a vaccine back then.
2913,"So, the lack of vaccines didn't really cause the emergence of Delta, as there weren't any vaccinations to begin with."
2914,"Also, the variant being first detected in a region doesn't necessarily mean that it originated there."
2915,"But I fully agree, there *is* disproportionate distribution of vaccines between the Developed and the Developing world, and there might be other variants springing out of high-population regions without adequate vaccinations."
2916,"What the lack of vaccinations in India *did* end up doing was causing a devastating wave of infections, which may have helped the variant spread to other corners of the world."
2917,1/5 have covid
2918,&gt; Okay so you have no issue with getting the shot.
2919,You just want someone to PAY you to get the shot.
2920,"What if the government made that illegal, would you get the shot immediately?"
2921,If the government made financial compensation for the vaccine illegal?
2922,"I suppose I would get it, no point in holding out any longer."
2923,&gt;This is called blackmail.
2924,"""You give me things I want or else"" - government is already giving you the shot FOR FREE."
2925,WITHOUT MEDICAL COST.
2926,"They already handled the purchase, the distribution, the cost of medical services, storage, everything else."
2927,"You want the government, your boss, your company, whoever to give you MORE?"
2928,It's called leverage.
2929,"The government wants people to be vaccinated, I don't have to get the vaccine if I don't want to."
2930,"If they give me some money, give me a tax break, or give my employer a tax credit for giving me PTO to go and get the vaccines, I will do it."
2931,"They want something, I want something, let's meet in the middle and get on with it."
2932,"The government can surely afford it, they steal thousands from me every year anyway."
2933,"&gt; What and ungrateful, socialist, freeloader."
2934,"Call me whatever you want, I need money and I have leverage."
2935,"If the government wants to be a bunch of cheap fucks, let them; we'll just have another series of lockdowns, economic downturn, etc."
2936,Not surprised.
2937,"The numbers aren't bad yet, but they're growing very very quickly."
2938,Malaysia boleh!
2939,&gt;	Scientists and institutions are slow by their design.
2940,This is a good thing…We treat science like politics - a change signals weakness or evidence of past deceit.
2941,THANK YOU.
2942,"As a public health professional, I’m so goddamn tired of the spicy-ass takes so many people on this sub have about the CDC."
2943,Things change and public health has to respond to that change!
2944,Unfortunately it’s not usually at the pace that the general public wants
2945,"GA, especially Atlanta, is a far cry from Alabama."
2946,"I promise mask mandates are never coming back to Alabama, unfortunately."
2947,O
2948,Good news.
2949,Some people who are allergic to pfizer or moderna ingredients can now have a choice.
2950,&gt; It doesnt make sense for any vaccine maker to do this.
2951,Why would someone thing pfizer is a scam but not sputnik.
2952,Its just not good marketing.
2953,I would agree - stoking anti-vaxx sentiments are not likely to cause demand spikes for your vaccine.
2954,"But if you remove those, you're left with cranky millionaires and state actors."
2955,&gt; The other possibility is that the entire story is false.
2956,It wouldnt be the first Russian conspiracy story that turned out to be entirely invented.
2957,"Why would famous and well trusted influencers with millions of followers make up such a story, and especially in a way ""they asked us to say X"" that can be corroborated in a way that turns out to be very expensive to some others (who, in fact, had said exactly X on their channels, before deleting the content)."
2958,Best you can imagine is some sort of bizarre governmental psy-op that approached well trusted non-governmental individuals and nobody blew the whistle on them?
2959,"I find that less credible than a ""plausible deniability"" chaos operation running into operational problems because some of the needed collaborators don't want to play along (always a massive risk when/if trying something like this)."
2960,I haven't seen any entirely invented Russian conspiracies.
2961,Certainly Russia (and China) seem to be extremely disciplined states with a bizarrely high tolerance of hacking activities aimed at the West.
2962,This is just a thing everyone working in IT security knows.
2963,"The ""bounties for US soldiers"" bit is the only one that I think did actually turn out to be complete bullshit, but I never saw it represented as fact (by media... redditors, yes), merely as a rumor that might warrant comment."
2964,"A little entrapment-y by the media for the politicians, but not a particularly tough one to get out of ""if this proves to be true, there will be hell to pay, but we cannot do geopolitics off rumors... lets let an investigation take place"" (or something along those lines)."
2965,"Also OPV is single dose, when IPV is five shots, so in place where it's difficult to make a kid follow all the step it's better the OPV."
2966,I like this method.
2967,"If we’re not going with the vax mandates, make life that much more difficult for for vaccine hesitant (I know the true antivaxxers are lost causes)."
2968,"Dine-in restaurants, or any indoor public place?"
2969,Show your vax card.
2970,I‘m hoping for a European Federation
2971,"I'm aware, I'm European."

2988,The next year is going to be wild.

2990,I really feel like we need our soldiers in top shape to respond to crisis areas both here and abroad.

2998,Depending on the  type of mask it can absolutely protect both you and others.
2999,High quality studies in healthcare workers in the UK conclusively demonstrate that properly fitted FFP3/N99 masks offer nearly 100% protection from infection.
3000,"Of course, said masks are rather expensive and require significant discipline, e.g always being clean shaven if you are a guy."
3001,My previous boss was just that.
3002,A true terror.
3003,yeah and guess who went cheap and only ordered limited amount of the highly effective mRNA vaccines.
3004,Didn't even bothered to contact Moderna or Pfizer top management about it when the whole nation depends on it.
3005,"Scomo, you fucked up"
3006,It's because it's not fully FDA approved yet.
3007,Same reason that employers can't mandate it yet.
3008,But a lot of places are getting ready for sweeping changes once the final FDA approval comes through.
3009,Expect to see more vaccine mandates and penalties for unvaccinated people by the end of this year.

3204,and he returns to praying.
3205,The boat paddles off.
3206,The flooding gets a lot higher.
3207,"The water rushing faster, and the man prays harder."
3208,"As the water reaches the rooftop, a helicopter flies overhead, and a voice on a microphone tells the man he is going to send down a rope ladder and they can fly him to safety."
3209,"The praying man again refuses the helicopter and says, ""No thank you, I am a man of faith."
3210,"God will save me."""
3211,the helicopter flies away.
3212,"10 minutes later the flood overtakes the roof and as the praying man's lungs fill with the turbulent water he asks God: ""God, I have been a devout to you all my life, why didn't you save me?!?"""
3213,"God replies, "" I sent you a boat and a helicopter, what else do you expect me to do?"""
3214,"God sent you masks, warnings and vaccines."
3215,Don't deny God.
3216,The more people who get it the faster we will achieve immunity.
3217,So yes I am encouraged by this.
3218,"I get that English isn’t your first language, but it makes your title fairly misleading, and the article that you linked is in a language that most people here can’t read, so there isn’t any clarification."
3219,"Your title makes it sound like there are people protesting the vaccine in those countries listed, and I honestly don’t know of any vaccine protests."
3220,"I have heard about anti-lockdown protest and anti-masking protests, but those aren’t anti-vaccine protests."
3221,"So change the word ""raise"" to ""bonus""."
3222,Your correct.
3223,That analogy makes better sense.
3224,The rest of it still applies though
3225,[removed]
3226,"One estimate put infection rates a day above a plausibly possible 200,000 a day."
3227,"They would be winter levels, basically as bad as it's ever been."
3228,"Time will tell, but there little reason to believe 49% vaccinated with infectious vaccinated people will have a huge impact on slowing the spread at a national level, though regions could see better results with higher rates and appropriate restrictions"
3229,"This is true, except for people who get regularly tested for work, etc."
3230,So we can't use this to say definitively that the virus prevents mild cases.
3231,"But it's obvious that it keeps you from getting severely ill, and it's highly likely that less severe illness means lower amount of virus produced means less contagious."
3232,These dudes all have the exact same facial hair... just like the 6 Jan. dudes...
3233,"Henry Ford Health System, Trinity Health in Michigan

Spectrum health and Beaumont Health Systems are giving people 6 to 8 weeks post-FDA approval to get vaccinated."
3234,I don’t think that’s really a correct analogy.
3235,"This is a one or two time event (vaccination), not a workplace where you are consistently demonstrating skills, etc."
3236,to someone who you have some sort of relationship with.
3237,"And other people weren’t getting $100 at the time you got vaccinated, so you weren’t sitting there getting vaccinated while you watched other people get $100."
3238,It’d be more like a job you did a couple years ago and did well decided to pay more to the next person to have it to try to increase incentives to do well.
3239,"Again, I don’t disagree with the main point that this is rewarding bad behavior, and I agree the money would have been good for people before too."
3240,The government should have thought about incentives at the beginning of rollout.
3241,But things are the way they are now so that can’t be changed.
3242,"Something needs to be done and options are limited, particularly for something short term/immediate and easy to effect."
3243,"Once approved, Insurance will refuse to pay for hospital bills if folks don't get vaccinated and get sick."
3244,Ever seen how large those health care bills get?
3245,This is peak Missou-rah
3246,Unless the plans changed wasn't going in person still on a choice basis?

3250,My big question is what made Provincetown unique and not the hundreds of other gatherings across the US?
3251,"Take a trip around the state while stopping at every pharmacy, return home to retire"
3252,"SAME, it took everything i had to not point out the hypocricy for sake of the venue."
3253,There are different types of hesitancy.
3254,Different demographics will react to different approaches.
3255,"South central L.A. will need a different approach than north Alabama, etc."
3256,"Maybe God did with the mask, vaccine, social distancing similar to the car, boat and helicopter."
3257,[removed]
3258,The article makes it sound like they are planning to test every student and staff member every week.
3259,"""...it will require all students and district employees returning to in-person activities for the upcoming academic year to undergo 'baseline and ongoing weekly COVID-testing,' regardless of their vaccination status."""
3260,What’s funny is the test isn’t even accurate.
3261,I don't believe it's ever a good thing to willfully decide not collect basic data that gives you information that monitors how well vaccines are working and how much transmission contribution there could be from vaccinated individuals.
3262,"This is necessary to assess when we need boosters, what measures are needed in e.g."
3263,"schools, and so so many important facets of public health measures."
3264,The US can certainly afford to collect the data.
3265,The more unvaccinated people who get COVID the faster COVID ceases to be a huge problem since a higher percentage now have some sort of immunity which is why I no longer support masking and social distancing.
3266,Alabama.. not the one to be left behind.
3267,"I mean, he's already blown his medal chance because if a ""hoax""."

3297,This has been my take the whole time.
3298,"We've mailed out like 2.5k stimulus money per person, attaching it to vaccination seems like a free win."
3299,"Of course, some will insist they cant get the vaccine-  and if everyone else is going to get it to protect you it seems fine that you dont get the money."
3300,That's not how student loans work.
3301,And ever wonder why they can't be expunged through bankruptcy like all other loans?
3302,"Or why banks are eager to give a 17 year old a $100k student loan, but not a $100k business or home loan?"
3303,There isn't a single person alive who doesn't deserve to have their student loans wiped.
3304,And comparing people who were duped into college to antivaxxers is like comparing doctors to rapists.

3307,&gt; I would be happier if this was incorrect or an anomaly.
3308,Pretty sure its neither.
3309,Its been pretty obvious for about a week now that being vaccinated does close to nothing when it comes to being infected with Delta and being a carrier of it (though it does a great deal in terms of your outcome).
3310,"Lest anyone think I'm just hindsighting here:

3313,I was just in Lithuania for a little over a month.
3314,They actually have a covid passport app where you have to either be vaccinated or else have weekly covid tests.
3315,"It’s great in theory, except the enforcement ultimately falls on the individual business to enforce."
3316,"There were a few places that did ask for it, but most places just wanted (need) the revenue."
3317,Does this mean I can permanently work remote in a cheaper city if I don’t get vaxxed?

&gt; So, unless SARS-CoV-2 becomes so virulent that it causes people to become severely ill and self-isolate before they transmit the virus to other people, there is no pressure on it to become less deadly."

3351,Human cells DO HAVE REVERSE TRANSCRIPTASE ACTIVITY!

3373,They are literally killing their voting base.
3374,[removed]
3375,We are not back to square one.
3376,I'm not sure why people are suggesting that.
3377,We can both acknowledge the fact that vaccines work and that vaccinated people can still spread the virus.
3378,These are not mutually exclusive.
3379,I have no idea why some people see it as one or the other.
3380,"Everything is bigger in Texas, even the Big Government dictating to smaller local government."
3381,"I am immunosuppressed and have had 4 antibody tests, all negative."
3382,I did have a huge response to my second dose of Moderna in early February so I’m just hoping that there’s some protection going on that can’t be measured by current tests.
3383,"The good news coming out of Israel is that even though the vaccine's ability to stop you from catching covid appears to wane and is less effective against Delta, it is still VERY effective at keeping you from getting severe illness or needing hospitalization."
3384,I'm okay with risking catching covid if it isn't going to send me to the hospital.
3385,This is why we don’t have good breakthrough data.
3386,We’d have known this if the cdc didn’t screw up and tell vaxxed people not to get tested if they didn’t have symptoms.
3387,This will probably depend on circumstances of exposure also.
3388,If you go on a 4 hour closed window car ride with an infected person your chances of getting infected will be higher.
3389,So think strategically about risks you might be taking.
3390,"That’s great your friends are vaccinated, it’s got to be reassuring."
3391,For me it’s really just about feeling comfortable.

3416,"&gt; The delta variant of the coronavirus appears to cause more severe illness than earlier variants and spreads as easily as chickenpox, according to an internal federal health document that argues officials must “acknowledge the war has changed.”

&gt; The document strikes an urgent note, revealing the agency knows it must revamp its public messaging to emphasize vaccination as the best defense against a variant so contagious that it acts almost like a different novel virus, leaping from target to target more swiftly than Ebola or the common cold."

3435,The Anti-vax in the USA has made the Federal Government to donate their extra supplies of vaccines to other poorer countries around the world.
3436,"So they are dying as ""heroes"" to save the world."
3437,Forget that.
3438,I say raise their insurance premiums since they are a high risk group.

3522,*
3523,Theres literally tons of people with upvoted comments saying the same thing.
3524,This is absolutely an issue
3525,Non vaccinated should be penalized like smokers- if not vaccinated then pay higher insurance premiums or have your benefits cut.

3527,"People keep talking about this mythical beast, but I've never seen one."
3528,"good point, that makes a lot of sense."

3537,At this point I don't care.
3538,Unless they have no choice - which is different entirely - just stay out of my vaccinated space.
3539,"You want to stay unvaccinated, fine... No movies no theater no concerts no sporting events no bars no gatherings."
3540,I mean.
3541,No one is alienating the unvaccinated.
3542,"They should be, but they are absolutely not."
3543,They still go to work and bars and restaurants.
3544,Also in theory you could just lie
3545,Lord I'm coming home to you
3546,It's also most likely the reason why these corporations started mandating that their employees get vaccinated.
3547,"If you need your mental health to improve and your covid anxiety to go away, just follow almost any virologist on Twitter."
3548,They seem to be very incredibly encouraged by the vaccines and not that worried about Delta.
3549,"Yup, same ol' story over and over."
3550,Let me know if toilet paper starts selling out that's when we know we're fucked
3551,[removed]
3552,"So far it doesn't seem to be doing so, it just got more lethal and contagious indeed."
3553,The 'miracle' so far is available vaccines
3554,[It sure was](https://support.lollapalooza.com/hc/en-us/articles/4403048984852-Covid-19-Health-Policy-and-Lollapalooza-Entry-Requirements)
3555,I think so too
3556,Yay for it not being Arkansas anymore!
3557,(Woo pig…)
3558,That's a good point.
3559,I had actually read the hospitalized as a subset of the 74% vaccinated.
3560,A second look shows you are correct that it's not totally clear.
3561,wear a mask and possibly a shield and don't let people bully you about it.
3562,I think the one we heard about was an Indian study; there are apparently others that are informing their decision.
3563,[removed]
3564,Why can’t DC do this?!
3565,Instead they just say masks and call it a day.
3566,So fucking stupid.
3567,sometimes a venn diagram overlaps.
3568,i think this is one of them.
3569,i agree with your comment
3570,what a pointless reply
3571,Sure it did.
3572,It worked here.
3573,It worked in NY.
3574,It worked in every major US population center where mandates existed.
3575,"Good, might finally be able to fire the dead weight employees"
3576,"There's a TikTok video circulating with thousands of pro-lockdown comments, all because the users are afraid of WFH ending."
3577,It was a terrifying read.
3578,Imagine.
3579,You have deadly disease.
3580,You have an effective vaccine to prevent and minimize the disease impact.
3581,You choose not to vaccinate yourself.
3582,Does this make any sense?
3583,It can also cause memory problems.
3584,As I have found out... You're right and it isn't funny but I have to laugh at myself or it really gets me upset.
3585,"Lol enjoy your yearly boosters, our family and friends are never getting those jabs."
3586,We just out here living life mask free enjoy freedom.
3587,:)
3588,the only reason to not test the waxed was because we assumed that they could not possibly catch or transmit the virus.
3589,"Because of delta,  that is no longer true."
3590,"If you might have it,  even if vaxed, you need to be treated to prevent further spread."
3591,It makes a huge difference.
3592,"If vaccine effectiveness only drops 2-3% a year due to our body's immune system, in practice it means that we may not have to worry about another booster even with Delta variant in picture since effectiveness will remain fairly high."
3593,But if vaccine effectiveness is dropping 10% every 6 months without variants in the picture then we have to start thinking about boosters.
3594,Do you get it now?
3595,"Too fucking bad, be an adult"
3596,That means she isn’t doing her job
3597,Or maybe we have been wrong about corporate america all along.
3598,"I know several people who are vaccine-hesitant that have lied and said that they *are* vaccinated, but aren’t."
3599,"My boyfriend’s sister has everyone around her believing that she caught a “breakthrough case” of covid, but she just didn’t ever get vaccinated."
3600,"She is firmly on the left, and just didn’t want to admit that she’s scared of the vaccine because shes trying to get pregnant."
3601,"Just from my immediate surroundings, I don’t see people on the right refusing the vaccine in any greater numbers than friends in the left."
3602,"Granted I don’t know as many people on the right so my friends and coworkers aren’t a perfect way to judge, but I sure do know a lot of people who aren’t vaccinated on the left."
3603,[removed]
3604,In this instance it's interesting to see it day by day because lockdown ended last week so it helps to understand the impact.
3605,"We've also had bad weather this past week, with storms and torrential rain across large parts of the country, so people will have been mixing indoors more than the week before."
3606,Right?
3607,Find a fuckin hobby!
3608,[removed]
3609,"Yes they do, but that also means they have a financial incentive to produce more effective vaccines than their competitors."
3610,"So, they're not intentionally gonna make ineffective vaccines just to sell more boosters"
3611,Long term side effects are typically rare and usually show up soon after vaccination like the rare blood clots we've seen from J&amp;J and AZ.
3612,Also despite taking months none of the safety procedure was compromised.
3613,It still went through all the trials before getting approval i.e.
3614,phase 1/2/3 trials.
3615,We were simply able to develop a vaccine so quickly due to huge funding available immediately.
3616,Typically vaccines takes years to develop mainly because of a lack of funding.
3617,Remember clinical trials etc isn't cheap and it's actually rather risky for a pharmaceutical company to start pumping millions into a vaccine that could easily fail.
3618,That was different this time around since we had countries pre ordering vaccines before they had even reached phase 3 trials and pumping billions into vaccine development.

3625,Oh sorry didn't see you are from LA.
3626,My fault.
3627,The crazy thing about acting is it’s just humans trying to find the truth in behavior and then show that truth on stage.
3628,"Expect the bigger companies like Walmart, Amazon, and grocery chains start to push for these mandatory vaccinations or get fired once the FDA officially approves it."
3629,"Ok, totally a non sequitur, but how did you get the name Iowa\_Hawkeye?"

3637,So glad my entire family &amp; friends all decided to avoid the vaccine.

3654,"Kirk is most likely vaccinated, but it would be ironic if he got COVID and wasn't vaccinated after all the anti vax crap he has spewed."
3655,Explain to me how it's a punishment to get a free and potentially life saving vaccine.

3664,The vaccines were never 100% effective.
3665,Breakthrough cases don’t necessarily mean the virus mutated in a significant way.
3666,Even with the original strain of covid we would expect breakthrough cases
3667,Why would that make “this sub” happy?
3668,Isn’t it fascinating this virus has completely shifted our paradigm of medical privacy?
3669,"No longer are your medical decisions your own, but they are now not only my concern, but the concern of the federal government."
3670,"Surely this will be the one and only time this shift comes into play, and it certainly doesn’t signal a general move to reliance on socialized healthcare."
3671,"I know that’s a reddit fantasy anyway, so two birds with one stone."
3672,"Missouri is called the ""show me"" state."
3673,"It is hard to ""show you"" when you are six feet under."

3688,I still don't understand why getting vaccine became a political issue?
3689,"Yeah, but I am not sure how this connects back to public funding in the UK, legally."
3690,Maybe they were not allowed to profit anway.
3691,Stupid example: Universities in Germany are publicly funded.
3692,"Many of them have botanical gardens, and many of these gardens are open to the public."
3693,"But since the university is publicly funded, it is not allowed to charge an entrance fee, or even sell surplus plants."
3694,"They will instead put up a sign that suggests how much money you should put in the donation box when visiting, or how much money you should donate if you take this or that surplus plant."
3695,"If any special situation arises that requires the university to charge admission fees (let's say an inner city location that makes it necessary for the gardens to be guarded at night and the university wants to offset some of those salaries), then it takes many years of legal gymnastics to make that happen."
3696,"Especially since they used ""with"", meaning real chicken is one of the ingredients, but may not be the only, or even a primary, ingredient."

3702,Probably no big deal.
3703,This comment sounds pretty narrow minded.
3704,My country also introduced incentives due to vaccine hesitancy.
3705,From memory it was 6 eggs.
3706,And it had a massive effect on vaccine uptake.
3707,And for reference we also have no free health care.
3708,And from what I know of.
3709,Many other countries introduced insensitives too.
3710,Either through bonuses given to people for getting vaccinated.
3711,Or through punishments for those without vaccines.
3712,This is why we still a lot of pandemic left.

3782,Interesting that the UK is listed when just about 90% of all eligible people have chosen to get vaccinated...
3783,Let’s say someone was gay.
3784,And their conservative Christian family is adamantly against homosexuality.
3785,Would you say they were promoting heterosexuality by not admitting they were gay?
3786,"Honestly, there needs to be a better term for this."
3787,Idk about anyone else but ‘Long Covid’ just sounds so silly to my ears..
3788,If there is another term for this condition I’d love to hear it and for perhaps the media to start using it instead
3789,That conversation is giving me a headache imagining it
3790,I think maybe you aren’t being the right kind of pedantic?
3791,"“Vaccine hesitancy” is a very specific term, and “not wanting to get fired by an antivaxx boss” isn’t that."
3792,Just like there are lots of very eager teenagers getting vaccines (of all kinds) that don’t want their anti-vaxx parents to know.
3793,It’s a regular topic in medical and legal subreddits.
3794,I actually think it’s a sign of how much these people want to be vaccinated.
3795,If they’re willing to disguise themselves!

3812,That's what I'm waiting for.
3813,I wear my mask and don't go anywhere and if I have to I still social distance and sanitize.

3815,"I've had covid and know it sucks, I just want to be sure about what I'm putting into my body."
3816,Every vaccine has gone through long term side effects testing except this one.
3817,I know its mRNA and not traditional but the only extensive testing done with mRNA that any one talks about is with rabies.
3818,Rabies is not spread over air like covid is.
3819,When it is FDA approved I will absolutely get it.
3820,Nope.
3821,No proof.

3823,"More honor system bullshit, as if we haven't already learned that our countrymen have no honor."
3824,"For majority of countries, it is not possible because they don't have enough vaccines."
3825,Getting a mask is a lot easier than getting vaccinated.
3826,"Unfortunately, majority of people don't wear a mask right."
3827,"In my country, the vaccination center is the easiest place to get yourself infected (you are stuck for hours in extremely huge crowd with poor ventilation)."

3829,No one is forcing them to simp to this piece of human garbage.

3832,Was this training from Trump University?
3833,Is that for symptomatic infections or all infections?
3834,"1) Political beliefs (duh)

2) Race (Blacks and Hispanics less likely to be vaccinated)

3) Income level (lower-income less likely to be vaccinated)

4) Age (younger people less likely to be vaccinated)"
3835,Lol if this has vast animal reservoirs it's going to be with us forever.
3836,Probably because they already had covid and it was nothing more than a mild cold for them
3837,I have heard some speculation that follows this line of reasoning.
3838,"However, if you browse the “Covid-19 Positive” and “Covid Longhaulers” subreddits, you’ll quickly find countless threads and comments about fully vaccinated people developing some of the scarier, long-term symptoms of covid."
3839,"In my opinion, it would not be worth it to purposefully expose yourself to the virus for a “booster” dose."
3840,"There are also many anecdotal reports of people who have been fully vaccinated relatively recently, like in the past 1-2 months, and yet have still contracted covid and developed symptoms."
3841,"So, it’s not even a question of “waning immunity,” it seems."
3842,"All this to say… I am seriously regretting getting a haircut the other day, with neither myself nor any of the barbers wearing masks."
3843,I live in a high-vaccination county where people have generally taken this situation seriously since the very beginning.
3844,"So, I thought I was safe."
3845,"Then this avalanche of news about delta, all week."
3846,Not feeling too good about it.
3847,Obviously you can’t read.
3848,New Jersey has the highest covid death rate in the country.
3849,That means any other state in the US New Jersey was worse.
3850,And comparing to foreign countries New Jersey has worse death rate than all but Peru and Hungary.
3851,So you are happy to be in just about the worst place in the world for covid death.
3852,Never mind that most of the state smells like a chemical factory and is devoid of anything that anyone from another state would want to see.
3853,I think it's a big game of projection.
3854,"They only ever want control, so they think everybody else only ever wants control."

3860,"Having spent several days on a ventilator pre-COVID, I can’t bring myself to actively wish that fate on anyone, no matter how stupidly they’ve behaved."

3867,“There’s no such thing as a perfect vaccine .
3868,.
3869,.
3870,"with Covid it’s no different,” said Professor William Schaffner, an infectious disease specialist at Vanderbilt University."
3871,"The yellow fever jab, for example, is widely understood to be the most effective live-virus vaccine ever invented, with a single dose generating long-lasting immunity in 98 per cent of those vaccinated."
3872,"But even that means that on average 2 per cent of people will still get infected."""

3885,When had zero ever been the goal?
3886,Not zero people also die from the flu.
3887,The issue is what the unvaccinated for this disease.
3888,Agreed 100%.
3889,Communication is important.
3890,You cant flip flop.
3891,Some people who are not vaccinated doesnt mean they are antivaxer.
3892,They just hesitant because the information is inconsistent.
3893,"For example when word around the world AstraZeneca had blood clotting issues and some countries were quick to halt it, canada was still communicating it was safe and blah blah blah because of science only to do a 360 3 weeks later."
3894,Be consistent.
3895,"Initially the vaccine was not clearly communicated that it didnt prevent the vaccinated from catching  and spreading, so that lead to the false information by many pro vaxxers that it is the holy grail."
3896,We see this article now saying the vaccinated can be infected and spread just as much as the unvaccinated.
3897,What messaging will we hear next month?
3898,Maybe CDC should get ahead.
3899,Maybe make the media accountable for spreading the misinformation.
3900,Well the number of cases certainly wouldn’t be *lower* but you have some good points.
3901,"It still means there’s a ton of unverified cases though and isn’t a great sign, even if it doesn’t mean the same thing as 21.5% last year."
3902,"Very dramatic, I could almost see your veins popping."
3903,"Unfortunately, Covid Zero is an impossible dream."
3904,Australia can't get Delta under control.
3905,Neither can Vietnam or Taiwan right now.
3906,Sorry to tell you.
3907,"Man, talk about projection."
3908,They only cared after it affected them
3909,"Killing his voter base, literally."
3910,Seems to be all but I could be looking at the data wrong.
3911,Also on transmissibility the slides never say vaccinated people do transmit the virus at the same rate as unvaccinated but that they MAY.
3912,Hopefully they clarify tomorrow and have more data.
3913,"Just got my second vaccine this morning and now at midnight, I’m beginning to feel the aches around my body and that fan I like to run is making me real cold."
3914,Guessing the headache isn’t far behind.
3915,"In the edge of my impending misery, I was wondering if we should have a chat room or something, for the people who are going through it."
3916,"It’s the sort of thing a lot of people share, so some solidarity might be nice."
3917,Right.
3918,"I agree with you to an extent, but it's an equally big problem that the general public is so inflexible that they can't absorb new information."
3919,What I don’t get about the CDC Director is that she very confidently declared a few months ago that vaccinated people cannot SPREAD the virus.
3920,At that time I was very perplexed because there was already anecdotal data here and there of breakthrough infections and of asymptomatic vaccinated people spreading it.
3921,I am vaccinated but have a person in my household who is immunocompromised (takes immune system-dampening drugs for an autoimmune condition) and they may or may not have developed immunity.
3922,"The drug prevents proper immune response formation and they didn’t get sick or anything at all following either shot… And I, as a vaccinated person, could possibly spread it to them and that changes everything tbh."
3923,It was a bit irresponsible to issue blanket guidance as they did earlier.
3924,"Some highlights:

- “it’s important to distinguish between apathy, hesitancy, refusal, and access issues”

- “three kinds of concerns about Covid-19 vaccines: anxiety about safety and side effects, religious beliefs against vaccines, and perceptions of personal risk from Covid-19.”



- “The most challenging group to vaccinate, and the largest, are those ideologically opposed to Covid-19 vaccines."
3925,"A July poll by the Associated Press and NORC Center for Public Affairs Research found that among unvaccinated people, 35 percent said they probably would not get vaccinated, while 45 percent said they definitely would not."
3926,And refusal is closely tied to political views.”
3927,[removed]
3928,I’m assuming you remember exponential growth.
3929,Just give it a couple of weeks.
3930,"“Must move the goal posts”

They said the bit!"
3931,They're not united with Republicans.
3932,"African Americans have a long history of poor treatment in our healthcare system, such as black women being 2-3 times more likely to die from pregnancy related issues than white women [\[1\]](https://www.cdc.gov/media/releases/2019/p0905-racial-ethnic-disparities-pregnancy-deaths.html) or being forcibly sterilized [\[2\]](https://www.pbs.org/independentlens/blog/unwanted-sterilization-and-eugenics-programs-in-the-united-states/)."
3933,"Black people and some other minority groups are the only ones I have some level of sympathy for when it comes to vaccine ""hesitancy,"" even if I also wish they would just get the shots."
3934,"Anyone who is scared because of this history and not because they are united with Republicans or deep in some conspiracy rabbit hole (in other words, united with Republicans) needs to be assured by a trusted member of their community.. maybe church, maybe their PCP, family member, friend, whatever."
3935,Yeah...that's the future we all face.
3936,The virus isn't going to go away.
3937,At this point slowing spread is delaying the end of this where we achieve some widespread societal immunity where this becomes simply endemic.
3938,"The goal here is to limit hospitalizations so that our hospital system isn't overrun while that process takes place, but we need to get people immunity one way or the other as much as possible up to that point."
3939,Vaccine mandates would be the more humane way of doing that.
3940,[removed]
3941,Really not a lot of people could get the vaccine in April of 2020 o\_O

3944,I’m getting my own booster shot tomorrow lol
3945,"I'm going to be honest, I wouldn't say im anti-vax but I was raised in an anti-vax household."
3946,I'm going to get my first dose tomorrow but I'm still skeptical.
3947,"As a mid-twenties male going for Pfizer, how worried should I be about the myocarditis (inflammation of the heart) that it is causing?"
3948,"Also, this dose will be my first vaccine since I was extremely young."
3949,Is the vaccine safe to get if I have never gotten the flu shot and don't even have some of the other vaccines doctors recommend?
3950,Also how do I know I'm not allergic to the ingredients of the covid vax?
3951,Move now.
3952,AZ Florida and Texas are not backwards.
3953,Our governor's do not allow masks.

3955,Unless those nerves die due to lack of oxygen…
3956,What a brave statement.
3957,You’re really standing against the crowd
3958,It might not tho
3959,Unless this is a non-sequitur I think you’re misunderstanding the statistic.
3960,High percent positivity just means the actual case numbers are much higher than confirmed.
3961,At this point CDC recommendations are a lagging indicator.
3962,&gt;What exactly is a reasonable path forward at this point?
3963,"I don’t mean the question to come across as antagonistic, more fatalistic."
3964,"Rationally, it will get worse later this year."
3965,"Unless they start implementing boosters, the summer months are supposed to be *less* contagious months as seen last year."
3966,"If there is no booster or even the S.A. variant booster Pfizer &amp; Moderna were developing on their own, the only tools we have are the same vaccines from a year ago."
3967,And this is for those who are currently vaccinated.
3968,This winter will be brutal unless a miracle happens.
3969,Those who can't or will not receive the vaccine is just asking to get infected with this new variant.
3970,Haven’t felt sick yet just loss of smell.
3971,Roommate got sick and claims she was about to get the shot but is mad at me
3972,With no masks.

3975,"Tested how, by the PCR tests they just said were faulty."
3976,"From the beginning it should have been we don’t know, but recommend masks."
3977,Period.
3978,Full ffucking stop.
3979,"Yeah honestly I was all about wearing a mask to help keep people safe last year, but there’s no fucking way I’m doing it now."
3980,"At least at my workplace, the unvaccinated seem to be the people who didn’t/still don’t wear masks, so why the fuck should I have to wear one when I made the responsible decision to get the jab."
3981,"The unvaccinated population claims to be patriotic, but yet will not do the most basic deed to help the country that they claim to love so much."
3982,"Why is it that every other country in the world, although less patriotic than the US, understands that things need to be done for the greater good, and that not everything is about individual freedom."

3985,That’s the same with other subreddits too.

4078,"If you only test symptomatic individuals, you get really high rates."

4182,That’s why our lives have been uprooted the last 18 months…..
4183,We still do not know about long covid amongst the vaccinated.
4184,The lowest vaccination rates in my state are all under the age of 30.
4185,"&gt;60% of senior citizens have been fully vaccinated, but college students are absolutely refusing to."
4186,This is why it was extremely important for the virus to not spread to densly populated areas in developing countries..
4187,The civilised countries and the authorities fucked up so hard last year and the general population who refused to wear masks and to practice social distancing are equally at fault.
4188,"If we had common sense, maybe there wouldn't have been any Delta around and everything would have been better..."
4189,Yeah.
4190,They're POSITIVE they have COVID!
4191,"Look, I get what your saying."
4192,"But from the reports so far, while vaccinated individuals are more prone to being a carrier than they used to be, the vaccine is still effective."
4193,"And while the world as a whole might not be able to withstand the delta variant, the vaccine as a whole was readily a available here for a long time."
4194,This WAS preventable.
4195,"&gt; they are dying as ""heroes"" to save the world."
4196,This is hilarious
4197,"you're leaving out the ones who don't relate and don't understand even when they get it, either"
4198,Bruh wut?
4199,Did most nurses get the vaccine?
4200,[removed]
4201,"Yeah, it's more a timeline difference though."
4202,A vaccinated person (assuming the virus gets a foothold) will clear the virus and thus be done shedding the virus much sooner than an unvaccinated person.
4203,"This doesn't mean unvaccinated people shouldn't wear masks, but it's an important note."
4204,"You have to remember that are large number of people are stupid and by making public (and factual) statements about the vaccine's inability to prevent X, you just give them the fuel they need to continue to make excuses to not get vaccinated."
4205,Instead it's important to focus on what mitigation tactics need to be deployed in a more clear way.
4206,"For example: Exposure to covid infected persons usually means you should quarantine for 2 weeks, and contact tracing needs to be performed on everyone you came into contact with between exposure and your quarantine."
4207,For vaccinated individuals that quarantine timeline is shorter.

4215,They will probably blame you for being non solidaric by taking the easy way out
4216,lmao don't try
4217,"Yeah, I'm confused by the terminology here."
4218,"Maybe ""Black"" status means diverting ambulances/canceling procedures, but any time I've heard the term ""Code Black"" in the US it's a bomb threat."
4219,"Yeah, but children start from a very low risk baseline, so it's not as bad as it sounds."
4220,Vaccinated elderly are still at more risk of getting a severe case of Covid (Delta or not) than unvaccinated children.
4221, It's almost like the full effects of economic policies take years to come to fruition.
4222,Shocking.
4223,"Which doesn't work for the news cycle, people's attention spans, or their critical thinking."

4232,Lets double every three days!
4233,JnJ is essentially useless at stopping delta infections.
4234,You need either a second dose or an mRNA dose on top of it.
4235,Murica fuck yeah
4236,Is the approval process as long as the original since it's just a booster?
4237,Including kids - that is a decent percentage for fully vaccinated.
4238,If it’s like other areas with that percentage your over 60s are probably at about 80% vaccinated.
4239,Living your life in a normal cold/flu season has a higher risk of myocarditis than the mRNA vaccines.
4240,1 in 5000.
4241,Some of us are playing chess and the unvaccinated are playing hangmen.
4242,Hey at least they’re positive about it!
4243,Whopping cough.
4244,I got vaccinated for whooping cough (TDAP) around 12 years ago and forgot to get a booster.
4245,Jan 2020 I got whooping cough and it sucked.

4276,NJ was A.
4277,Hit in the 1st wave.
4278,1st wave states have higher death rates because hospitals were still trying to figure out how to treat covid and had no idea what treatments were effective.
4279,This led to a high death toll.
4280,B. NJ is the most densely populated state in the United States.
4281,It has a large handicap when it comes to fighting covid.
4282,"However, this has caused NJ to be one of the more serious states when dealing with covid and the state has a higher vaccination rate than many others."
4283,"NJ really is a resilient little state, and it's not seeing the worst of this wave, so not a bad place to be right now."
4284,"When I talk to vaccinated people they say ""we"", the others use ""I"", *a lot*."
4285,Listen for it.
4286,This does not surprise me.
4287,"&gt; Why are they moving the goalposts

Because they got new data and that data scared them."

4289,Is this from covid or vaccine?
4290,"Mortality rate isn’t 100%, and people who survive or only get a mild outcome will buy into the bs"

4292,True enough.
4293,Mississippi is Alabama's ugly friend they take out to make themselves look better.
4294,It could not have been prevented.
4295,"I understand your frustrations with unvaccinated folks, but you have to remember that globally only about 15% of the world is fully vaccinated, leaving 85% of the population vulnerable to infection and thus more likely to produce variants."
4296,"After all, this variant came from India, where the vaccination rate is very very low."
4297,"We simply do not have enough vaccine for the global community and if a new variant is going to arise it’s because of the unvaccinated globally, a large percentage of whom are willing to get vaccinated but have not yet had the opportunity."
4298,It comes and goes.
4299,Not as bad as it was the first few days.
4300,LOL What?
4301,You think any mainstream newspaper will publish an email or CDC hack?
4302,Good!
4303,Alabama is a heavily Republican state with very poor people.
4304,Two things that are already bad enough but should never be mixed together.
4305,He fucking deserves it.
4306,We keep moving the goalposts on the vaccines has the Delta variant spreads.
4307,"A few weeks ago, authorities were saying ""the pandemic was over for you"" if you are vaccinated."
4308,"Now they're saying ""well at least you're not so likely to be dead."""
4309,"I hasten to add that people should definitely get vaccinated, but we do seem to be reducing our expectations dramatically."
4310,My grandmother is convinced her supposed flu a few months before the start of the pandemic was a form of coronavirus.

4313,Denial.

4315,It does seem a little bit stupid that a vaccine isn’t “approved” even after half the damn country has taken it.
4316,"I’m going to be honest, if I ever hear someone ever use a phrase like “fear-mongering” in relation to public health to my face ever again, I will physical confront them."

4322,"I had a breakthrough case and unfortunately both of my kids got Covid, too, my son most likely from me."
4323,It’s hard to quarantine from your own kids.
4324,It’s been a little more on the intense side for us and I’ve been posting on Reddit partially to process.
4325,Are you saying long haul covid occurs only in people who have been infected with mononucleosis in the past?
4326,(If these studies are correct?)
4327,It unironically does.
4328,"Well Israel has already ordered a 3rd pfizer booster shot for the elderly, so I think there is serious reason to worry at this point."
4329,"And go armed, because some of these psychos will do a lot more than bully you about it."
4330,"It would have been hard to mandate vaccination for entry in the US, when you could reasonably claim that unvaccinated pose a risk to patrons whereas vaccinated people do not."
4331,This is no longer the case and therefore will not happen.
4332,We’re being told that if someone does catch Covid then they are infectious regardless of vaccine status.
4333,"So, the only difference between vax and unvaxxed now is the chances that the person has Covid they can give to others, which is something that is impossible to use as a way to choose who can go in or not."
4334,[removed]
4335,Haha this is hilarious!
4336,It could be worse my home province (Alberta) just announced if you're sick with covid you have every right to run around spreading the disease.
4337,"That's because they shoved all the intellectuals into one place, so they could keep an eye on them."
4338,They don't trust book learnin.
4339,The current ones provide some chance of sterilizing immunity.
4340,"It was 90% before delta, now it's like 60%."
4341,"Abbott uses a wheelchair, so by saying he should be a “stand up guy,” they’re making fun of his disability."
4342,"Which is pretty lame, if you ask me."
4343,Cannot even imagine what that's like.
4344,Instead of ramping up vaccinations they thought they could just go zero covid without any issues.
4345,It seems alarmingly obvious that it's unavoidable no matter how successful you have been.
4346,"You're probably right, I bet these days you need at least an associate's degree to work at Target."
4347,Abbott is in a wheelchair since he was paralyzed by a tree that fell on him at age 26.
4348,I think his comment misleads what an empath is.
4349,I think it's just poorly written.

4361,I don't really know what's the governments plan regarding this actually is since they have communicated very little on the topic.
4362,Some restrictions have come back on but there doesn't seem to be any actual long term plan on what they're going to do.
4363,"In general there is huge want to open up, which is completely understandable, but how they have planned to do that is, at least to me, complete mystery."
4364,There are talks about corona passes and such but nothing conrete as of yet.
4365,"One thing that is clear is that they are planning to move, in few months time, from focusing only on case numbers to putting more weight on the ammount of people at hospital and ICU and in general giving less weight to the ammount of cases."
4366,I would be all for it except we seem to know very little about long covid and possible neurological and cognitive impacts of covid.
4367,"Of course if the long covid manifests mostly as persistent cough and such it's no biggie, most colds and flus can have such persistent symptoms but if it manifests as long term fatigue, brain fog and such it wouldn't be too good."

4371,No kids are not.

4373,CDC publishes hospitalizations by age.
4374,Yep.
4375,Every COVID patient in our ICU is unvaccinated.
4376,They're also younger than they were during the last wave.
4377,God is punishing Alabama for wickedness.
4378,God is punishing Alabama for refusing to love their neighbors.
4379,God is punishing Alabama for following false prophets.
4380,God is punishing Alabama for taking the Lord's name in vain.
4381,God is punishing Alabama for hypocrisy.
4382,"God is punishing Alabama for their lack of charity, their false and performative faith, their willful ignorance, their unwillingness to love, their unwillingness to forgive, and their false, vile, pervasive and perverse sense of unearned moral superiority."
4383,"The vast majority of the citizens of my home state are terrible representatives of the Kingdom, and many of them will discover all too soon that they are unwelcome in it."
4384,Yes
4385,"The comment you replied literally said vaxxed is just as contagious as unvaxxed, hence the masks"
4386,"That's what the next step should have been anyway, not drop e everything altogether all at once."
4387,OPs comment was about the delta variant so that is what I thought you meant so fair point there but 19% of around 40 people is such an insignificant number it practically means nothing.
4388,Yeah it appears it can happen but we need way way more data than that of less than 10 people about their symptoms which were likely self reported.
4389,"&gt; The AdventHealth hospital system has put its Central Florida Division on code black due to a surge in patients who are suffering from COVID-19, officials say, adding that the number of patients has surpassed the previous peak in January."
4390,That’s not good.
4391,"What a crazy, upside-down world."
4392,"We're in a global pandemic, and there's ""backlash"" against people who are taking the one thing that can truly protect them from the virus (and it also helps them protect others)."
4393,It's mind-boggling.
4394,Maybe it will deaden their sense of misery for the declining world they're due to inherit
4395,Florida Man strikes again.

4397,"A lot of the unvaccinated are uneducated, lower income, don’t have a passport, and will never travel outside of their state or country."
4398,"If they live in a conservative area, they will be able to get away with not being vaccinated."

4400,It's all good.
4401,"Huntsville dweller here as well, and even if the image isn't a perfect fit, you don't have to drive far from Huntsville to find the rest of Alabama."
4402,Restaurants are packed with minimal masks currently.
4403,We'll see what happens with the US Government employee decision on vaccination next week.
4404,Getting vaccinated helped a lot and for the rest it’s pretty much just letting time run its course and see what happens.
4405,"1 dose isn't effective, this says 44% for 2 doses from 2 days ago 

Also I've commented elsewhere about the bottom part and how we studied the vaccines VS how the world is now."
4406,They truly may not be as effective if you hang out in tiny places with poor ventilation?
4407,&gt;Singapore has the 12th highest coronavirus vaccination rate in the world — similar to that of many counties in the Bay Area and using largely the same types of vaccines.
4408,"But in the past month, people who have received at least one vaccination dose have accounted for three-quarters of coronavirus infections in Singapore, according to Reuters."
4409,"&gt;saw 44% of its cases occurring in fully vaccinated people, along with 30% who were partially vaccinated and 25% who were unvaccinated,

&gt;Clusters of cases were being found in karaoke bars and markets, which pushed the Singapore government last week to tighten COVID-19 restrictions, including banning in-person dining and limiting the size of gatherings."
4410,"&gt;Chin-Hong said that when vaccine efficacy was studied early on, people were more restricted and cautious."
4411,"Now, they are moving more freely."
4412,He said the developments in Singapore are in line with the most current data.
4413,It says in the slides they are referencing viral load from an Indian study.
4414,I think it’s the same study that’s been retracted and they are scrambling.
4415,"I just did a quick back-of-the-envelope calculation for a virus with R0 = 10, and it looks like herd immunity is reached at about 67% immunity."
4416,"So you would still get herd immunity if the entire population were vaccinated, even if the vaccine is only 75% effective."
4417,Don't DeSantis my children.
4418,India virus.
4419,All I'll say is the vaccinated people are far more protected than the unvaccinated.
4420,There absolutely is a clear threat and this is not over but ppl are *freaking* out over the notion that full vaccination isn't a perfect protection.
4421,Well I'm hoping for a vaccine mandate.
4422,It's time to stop playing games with half measures.
4423,Full vaccine requirements now.
4424,"I’m curious what the people on this forum calling those of us selfish jerks - for being vaccinated, willing to continue masking, but no longer feel the need to be a complete social recluse in isolation- think about this."
4425,This is coming from scientists and experts.
4426,"Recently there's been lots of research into the fact that long haul covid might literally be an activation of mono, the kissing disease, which is a particularly nasty virus that can make people sick for a while."
4427,"While I agree with your thoughts about them maybe not being as sick, it also means this isn’t a true vaccine and shouldn’t be called one if you still can get COVID."
4428,"I have this idea in my mind that these folks refuse to pay money to ""the man"" just in case."
4429,Not a lot of planners in the bunch.
4430,I could be wrong.
4431,These kinds of moves are making it more inconvenient to be unvaccinated than to go out and get vaccinated.
4432,I think that will win people over.
4433,"I have a coworker who claims his reason for remaining unvaccinated is that getting vaccinated would be a ""waste of [his] time""."
4434,"If we can get to the point where getting vaccinated prevents a lot of annoyance and inconvenience, people like him might just make the effort to go get it done."
4435,They’re supposedly releasing it tomorrow.
4436,This just straight up sucks.
4437,This is some sobering shit right here.
4438,Fox better report this when they make it official.
4439,I wanted info about kids but didn't see anything.
4440,I hope you beat it easily!
4441,"If you got the vaccine more than 2-3 weeks ago, you're probably going to experience a mild case."
4442,Hopefully very mild!
4443,We've honestly discussed it!
4444,"Texas homes aren't worth as much, though, so I wouldn't be able to move packing too many funds"
4445,[removed]
4446,No they’re not.
4447,Children under 12 can’t get the vaccine yet.
4448,You are underestimating a giant vulnerable population.
4449,They’re showing the data tomorrow and it is related to an outbreak in Cape Cod.
4450,It doesn’t work for anything really
4451,Do you think Target is hiring drop outs?
4452,They are polite clean well spoken people.
4453,It turns out Target and Costco are paying more but quite selective since they have a lot of candidates.
4454,"It was 80% under 60 and 50% over 60, but that study is attracting a lot of criticism."
4455,"When dealing with a outbreaks in a country where covid was previously near zero, we shouldn't try to extrapolate from the country-wide vaccination rate."
4456,"The outbreak will begin in local clusters, and the vaccination rate within those clusters is unknown."
4457,"If the outbreak begins in an area where nearly everyone is vaccinated, we may see a high portion of cases among the vaccinated."
4458,But this is because the unvaccinated in other areas aren't being exposed yet.
4459,"Similarly, if the outbreak begins in a low vaccinated area, we may see faster spread than the country-wide vaccination rate would suggest."
4460,"When we see these early outbreaks that seem to be extreme outliers from other data, we should view them with caution."
4461,"Obviously it *might* be a sign of a higher than expected breakthrough rate, but I'd say it's too early to panic."
4462,Wikileaks is nooooooooooooot where you should be sending anything sensitive.
4463,Go through credible journalists.
4464,"&gt;1000x the virus load that’s now known to be more deadly

Can we stop saying it's known to be more deadly?"
4465,We don't know that at all.
4466,The UK data shows a very low CFR still in a semi vaccinated population.
4467,The India CFR was pretty on par with most CFR calculations.
4468,"We need to stop taking ""appears"" or ""might be"" as fact."

4572,My vote is yes.
4573,I am vaxxed.
4574,Masked &amp; stayed at home until this summer started.
4575,Remember when people held out hope for contact tracing like 2 or 3 months into the pandemic when it was clear within the first 2 weeks of the virus hitting the US we had no hope of contact tracing?
4576,That is what this thought process is of waiting for mandates to vax non-vaxxers.

4603,They’re not victims.
4604,I just read an article that states that a loss of taste or smell is less common with the delta variant.
4605,According to the CDC PowerPoint that was leaked “breakthrough cases are expected and increase as a proportion of total cases as vaccine coverage increases.”  Their data shows that people who are vaccinated have an 8 fold-reduction in catching Covid-19.
4606,"Out of 100,000 people 21.4 who are vaccinated will catch Covid-19."
4607,178.6 who are unvaccinated will also catch it.
4608,Their current virus effectiveness is at 91% among fully vaccinated and 81% among partially vaccinated.
4609,"They also show that vaccinated people who do catch Covid have about 40% less of a mean RNA viral load, they have a shorter mean duration of detectible viral RNA (2.7 vs 8.9 days)."
4610,Hospitalizations and deaths have a 25 fold reduction compared to unvaccinated.
4611,Whoa.
4612,So ALL children under 12 and people who who got the first shot but experienced life threatening anaphylaxis should just head straight to the morgue.

4626,"They didn't test the same people  ""before and after"" COVID."
4627,"The comparison was of a ""post COVID"" group compared to a control group and then they matched them for age, income etc."
4628,Maybe there's a material difference that was not controlled for?
4629,Like their attitude towards the pandemic.
4630,"Anti-vaxxers, anti-maskers and assorted COVID deniers probably get infected in larger numbers (proportionally) compared to regular people."
4631,"So they would be overrepresented in the ""post COVID"" group."
4632,It's clear that some of the anti-vax/anti-mask crowd have real issues processing information.
4633,If they come out of COVID with cognitive deficiencies - maybe they had them before?
4634,Well they are one of the least educated states in the country.
4635,I feel you.
4636,It's going to be a terrible future.
4637,"Yeah this is what the WHO are saying, it would be better to not give a booster and make sure those vaccines go to poor nations (same in the eu)."

4846,+ like 55% of the population being vaccinated.. just adjust for a fair bit of overlap between those who had gotten it and were also vaccinated.. and you only need another good surge of infectious to possibly end this here.
4847,EVERYTHING’S FINE
4848,Compare the case count graph [here](https://covidactnow.org/us/michigan-mi/?s=21161039) to the one [here](https://covidactnow.org/us/louisiana-la/?s=21161039).

4852,"&gt;If it was 10,000 people in ICU beds then you have a real problem


https://ourworldindata.org/covid-hospitalizations


*Glances at the fact that our ICU usage is nearing 10,000 rapidly....*


Uhhh... Bruh, maybe keep up with the data?"
4853,Recovery from anosmia is about 88%.
4854,So you as an individual will probably recover.
4855,67% of people with Covid experience anosmia.
4856,So about 8% of cases lose their enjoyment of food permanently.
4857,"Yes, even mild or otherwise asymptomatic cases."
4858,It will be interesting to see what America is like when 8% of the population has lost its ability to enjoy food.
4859,"Or 4%, I suppose, with vax rate hovering around 50%."
4860,Thankfully yes.
4861,mandatory statement as to not have the stock market crash….
4862,"What does this mean for my kids, who are not eligible for a vaccine but have to go back to school five days a week in two weeks?"
4863,Odd that this is almost a mirror of what is happening in Florida.
4864,We were told the vaccine would make us invulnerable.
4865,People are acting accordingly.
4866,"It really sucks we have to wait so long for the littles to get vaccinated, especially as someone who teaches preschool."
4867,But I also want the studies to do an effective job figuring out the dosage and showing that it is safe for them to take it.
4868,"By the time my kiddos at work can take a vaccine, we will be nearly two years into this thing."
4869,"Kids starting in the youngest class (2.5yr olds), will have known nothing but a pandemic life, which is really sad."
4870,"Hey man, no need to apologize."
4871,Thank you for sharing your story.
4872,"While hindsight is 20/20, it looks like you've made lifestyle changes that will do wonders for your health over the long run."
4873,"Keep seeing your psychologist, eating healthy, and exercising."
4874,"I'd also be open with your family about your internal struggles, since their support during this recovery phase will really help."
4875,Best of luck and let me know if there is anything I can do.
4876,"Keep in mind that the older, more conservative, have been much more interested in getting the jab, than the younger."
4877,"What we stand to lose here is a generation, maybe two."
4878,"Older people will, once again, have to parent the grandkids."
4879,exactly.
4880,empaths and narcissists are not the same at all.
4881,they may even be opposites.
4882,i believe 'empath' is essentially another term for 'highly sensitive person' though i know there may be some minor differences between the two.
4883,its very much a real thing.
4884,he can never get covid again.
4885,best vaccination of all.
4886,Yeah.
4887,Gonna need to see some data on that.
4888,"Dude, just stop it."
4889,"Please, stop."
4890,"I waited a year and a half, put my entire life on hold, so that people could have vaccines to protect themselves."
4891,"Now, the death rate from this wave is far lower than previous ones, and nearly all of the deaths that are occurring are in people who *chose* not to get vaccinated, who decided they wanted the risk."
4892,I absolutely hate what's happening to these people.
4893,I don't want to see anyone die.
4894,"But viruses spread, it's what they do, and the new variant is extremely good at it."
4895,"That disease-spreading behavior is basic human instinct, and fucking up my mental health by delaying it further isn't going to stop the risk-takers from getting Covid eventually."
4896,What's going to happen is going to happen.
4897,We have vaccines.
4898,We have treatments.
4899,All I can hope for is that more people will decide to accept these things.
4900,There's nothing more you can reasonably expect me to do.

4906,Surprised Pikachu
4907,&gt; Suggestion that covid could still result in death for a double vaxxed person was called misinformation.
4908,This is a straight up lie.
4909,No one I ever saw was saying vaccines were 100% effective against death.
4910,Just in the very high 90% range.
4911,And everything here backs that.
4912,The 3rd slide in this document shows a 25 fold reduction in death among vaccinated compared to unvaccinated people.

4914,"I got pinged twice by my track and trace app within two days, after being fully vaccinated."

4916,[removed]
4917,Nope.
4918,All it said was that long COVID is still possible for fully vaccinated people.
4919,But the chance is still reduced by an order of magnitude if the infection happens at all.
4920,"Yeah, and I'm there."
4921,"Not in a city, mind you, but still there."
4922,About every 50th person you see is wearing a mask.

4994,So stupid and senseless.
4995,I’m so angry at everyone involved with the Right’s misinformation machine.
4996,It's unfortunate that they can't mandate the vaccine for contractors that work on military bases.

5028,2 doses at any given pharmacy in a day opens up a 10 dose vial and wastes 8 doses
5029,It's the chickens coming home to roost moment for the anti-vax crowd.
5030,"It's frustrating that their ignorance jeopardizes others, but my hope for a silver lining in this is that Delta is such a speedy beast that it blasts through quick and gets out quick, a sort of ""ripping the band-aid off"" moment."
5031,"The never-vax crowd was always going to be a pain, and unless you were going to send teams of people into the sticks of the midwest/south forcibly injecting vaccines, the risk of exactly what we see happening was always going to be there."
5032,Maybe it's for the best we get this surge out of the way fast instead of a slow drip feed of that population circulating the virus for many more months/years.
5033,"If we had to have this moment, I would've preferred this type of wave to occur of course after every age group is eligible to get the vaccine, but at least the most at-risk of death have had ample time to get protected by now."

5240,Montco’s actually at 95% of our 18+ population and 78% of 12-18 with at least one dose.
5241,"Basically anyone who could get it, did, although our fully vaccinated numbers lag."
5242,Natural selection at work
5243,I get what you are saying.
5244,But Britain is only 57% vaccinated so quite not there with the 100% example and again the numbers are almost split down the middle.
5245,So we are seeing more of a 70/30 ratio.
5246,Which again is far less impressive than the 98/2 that the US is presenting.
5247,(I imagine this comment will continue to get thumbs down because people don't like statistics to show something different than what they believe).
5248,They will.
5249,"Of course they'll say something like ""THE VACCINE'S DON'T WORK...is something we wont' be saying because its not true....SO YOU'LL NEED A BOOSTER!!"""
5250,No we don’t know that the virus is transmitted by everyone regardless of vaccinated status.
5251,What we currently know is the vaccinated MAY be able to transmit as much as the unvaccinated.
5252,There’s a major difference between the vaccinated and unvaccinated that you are leaving out which is even contracting covid to begin with.
5253,Vaccines remain highly effective and still reduce your chances of becoming infected.

5300,"Yea, that’s why we have two distinct political parties."
5301,"No, that's not what they're saying."
5302,The data is showing that asymptomatic people can have a large nasopharyngeal viral load (10x vs the ancestral strain) and spread the virus just as easily as unvaccinated people.
5303,"That means we need nonpharmaceutical interventions (NPI, aka masks) to contain the spread."

5323,"Yeah but even from a selfish standpoint it might be best to share with countries that don't have enough, so the virus doesn't further transmogrify into some Gamma Deluxe variant that our vaccines don't protect against."
5324,"It's 74% of those in that group who live in Mass, not 74% of the entire 882."
5325,Get vaccinated and then no one would have to worry
5326,Do you people even read the articles you respond to?
5327,Not according to the cdc document published by Washington post today https://www.washingtonpost.com/context/cdc-breakthrough-infections/11fc6a11-20d7-466e-a654-c6bc8426f688/

5329,"The patient was likely insisting that they “didn’t need oxygen” when, in fact, they needed 8 liters/min."

5331,We’re already a step behind because we’re being dragged down by the dimwitted.
5332,They still selling those Dont Fauci my Florida shirts?
5333,This is what happens when you choose political narrative/ambition over scientific consensus.
5334,"To make matters worse, this deteriorating situation isnt going to be changing many minds."

5577,Its goddamn summer and people are getting vaccinated left and right.
5578,You really do expect people to stay locked down home forever?
5579,Also they are young people so likely they are safe.
5580,True but is there any data on vaccinated people getting long Covid?
5581,"It's important to note that you cannot infer anything about vaccine efficacy from these numbers because you are missing two major numbers (neither of which we will ever know)

1."
5582,"The vaccinated vs unvaccinated percentage of the population at that time (not just what it is in that city but what it was during that event/outbreak including everyone who travelled in)
2."
5583,"The number of people that were exposed and did not get infected

500 infections sounds like a lot but there's no way to know that the vaccine did not stop 5,000 other infections from occurring."
5584,Another point on the viral load is that since you are only looking at symptomatic infections this doesn't necessarily mean the vaccine doesn't protect against spread for most people.
5585,It says that if you get a breakthrough you may be able to still spread (there needs to be more work done to show that the detected virus is actually live though and not dead/neutralized).
5586,Basically the point comes down to this study is almost completely blind to asymptomatic or exposed vaccinated individuals because they mostly don't get tested.
5587,Without random testing in the population there is no way to extrapolate this data further.
5588,"That being said, it is important data to analyze and definitely at least provides some insight into why the CDC is worried and why they may suggest a change in strategy"
5589,At 8 weeks you should still be protected.
5590,The pfizer booster is suggested 6 months after the 2nd dose.
5591,"Abbot *knows* he needs trump's cult to win again, and in this gerrymandered shithole, the possibility is not comforting."
5592,There is little point.
5593,It will circulate and people who didn’t take the free vaccine won’t take the steps necessary to distance and mask.
5594,"Beyond that, to what end?"
5595,It just slows it down until it ramps up again.
5596,There is no way off this train other than vaxx or infection.
5597,"Vaccines work, AT PREVENTING DEATH…not infections nor spread."
5598,40% efficacy against Delta isn’t “working” especially when 30% of the US refuses  vax.
5599,"An antiviral would be purely defensive, for someone already infected."
5600,I suppose they could also reduce spread on some level.
5601,But in my mind it has more to do with making it “less of a big deal” to get Covid on an individual level.

5605,But I'm asking for justification for unusual restrictions on the rights of American citizens.
5606,Even a mask mandate is an unusual restriction that is unacceptable outside of extraordinary circumstances.
5607,The last year+ of pandemic counted as that.
5608,"But a disease that has less than a ~.00001 percent chance of doing me any sort of real harm, as well as most Americans, does not qualify as extraordinary."
5609,People die of illness.
5610,It happens.
5611,People are not dying at alarming rates from COVID if vaccinated.

5942,How the US’ dramatically higher vaccination rate and more dispersed population will affect our wave remains to be seen.
5943,"The UK appears to be on a similar 3 month trajectory, so maybe that is just what Delta brings, regardless of vaccination rates."

5951,People don’t agree with the CDC advise.
5952,Idk why you’re surprised.
5953,The CDC aren’t infallible.
5954,Your question is legitimate.
5955,"According to [UK's official site](https://coronavirus.data.gov.uk/details/vaccinations), UK has 71.4% of the population fully vaccinated (and 88.4% have taken at least one dose)."
5956,This makes much more sense.
5957,Agreed.
5958,I don't see how giving $100 to those of us who already did our part helps with any of that though.
5959,"Unfortunately those idiots have shown a free vaccine is not enough, and so the government is now considering bribing them"
5960,Not anymore...
5961,Both.
5962,It's misleading because a person who is concerned about their kid wants to know the chances of them being ok if they happen to catch Delta.
5963,"Delta cases could easily go back up again in the near future, especially now that social retrictions have been abandoned."
5964,What about ALL the other idiots from other states?
5965,What these people have in common is not Alabama!
5966,True Also the good news is less people are dying.
5967,"He, like all of the other shit head Republican politicians, are very much vaccinated."
5968,I honestly wish there was more engagement like what you're asking of people.
5969,It seems to me like a lot of people on this sub aren't attempting to engage in a larger awareness both in terms of literal unvaccinated humans (not just Americans) on earth while  looking forward in time to the future of this virus.
5970,My issue right now has to do with one thing - my 9 year old and 6 year old cannot be vaccinated.
5971,"They're still wearing masks, and I'd love it if they could avoid the virus before vaccination."
5972,"The way things are looking, that may not be possible."
5973,"We're not taking unnecessary risks, but we're also not shying away from letting them do things kids enjoy doing like having friends over, going to the beach, the pool, and playing softball."
5974,"Since I don't see any guidance from the CDC or literally anyone about working in offices and how THAT'S probably the most unnecessary risk of all, then I can't take seriously any public effort to curb risk."
5975,"Because if it's ""fine"" for me to get on a train or bus and go to an office with a strain/variant this virulent and contagious with zero legal support to keep from getting fired for refusing to do so, then nobody really gives a flying F if I take it home to my kids."
5976,"It's entirely incumbent upon me to decide what risk to take and we learn, once again, than in America, it's all really about money and political risk."
5977,"Okay, so that means I have to look at science and take matters into my own hands, as does my wife."
5978,Will I go to a concert yet?
5979,No.
5980,Not until my kids are vaccinated.
5981,We were going to a wedding in two weeks but have since decided not to.
5982,"If they were vaccinated, I think we'd go."
5983,"Because if we don't, then what is the calculation?"
5984,What are we then saying about bigger family get-togethers and the things we do in everyday life?
5985,Which ones should we stop altogether if we're not going to certain functions or events?
5986,And where are *our* blind spots?
5987,The things we're selectively not doing to seem like good COVID avoiders simply paying lip service through a mish-mash of misguided decisions about where and when to avoid crowds?
5988,I feel that part of what you're saying applies to anti-vaxxers.
5989,"As bad as it is for them, personally, I don't understand how anyone can think this wasn't going to happen even if every adult in the U.S. was vaccinated by now."
5990,"There are BILLIONS of unvaccinated humans for COVID to find and infect and spread among and that'll probably continue for years, if not decades."
5991,Does that mean don't get vaccinated?
5992,Of course not.
5993,I've been fully vaxxed for months.
5994,But it also means that the spread of delta can't be blamed entirely on the unvaxxed people in Missouri and Arkansas and Florida.
5995,I really don't think it's avoidable and we're going to see ups and downs in terms of positive cases but should pay way more attention to the amount of vaccinated people who are hospitalized.
5996,I think this is literally the most important metric right now.
5997,"Also, signs that a variant has become more infectious and deadly to children who cannot be vaccinated yet."
5998,Because this should then inform parents decisions about schooling prior to vaccination.
5999,These are the two things we're currently trying to get a handle on because seeing them get out of control would be bad.
6000,"We're not going to stamp out the virus, imo, but we can do a much better job of letting people know the signs - in real time - of when vaccine protections seem to be waning."
6001,Why is it so hard to get granular info on vaccinated that are hospitalized and their outcomes?
6002,Why is it so hard to get granular info on how Delta is affecting children versus the OG strain?
6003,Why does it seem like the only thing thrown in our faces on a near constant basis to scare the shit out of us is the total number of positive cases?
6004,"It's hard to find context and when you can't find it, many people don't have the time to sit and figure out the context on their own."
6005,"So, to finally answer your question, my 'ending' is when my kids are vaxxed... and when we're consistently given useful information to go about our daily lives."
6006,So yeah... never.
6007,It's basically up to all of us to engage in daily risk mitigation using the knowledge that's out there.
6008,"This doesn't prohibit businesses from enforcing a mask mandate, it just prohibits cities from forcing businesses to force a mask mandate"
6009,Do smokers even pay higher rates?
6010,There's really not an alternative.
6011,The economy(s) will stall without schools to watch children.
6012,I'm frustrated that the Federal Government is dragging their feet on ordering a booster shot.

6313,"Given that the US vax rate is maybe 50-60%, we would expect deaths to at least be a couple thousand per day (not a few hundred which it actually is) if case growth is really as high or higher than in January, especially since there should be more cases in the unvaccinated."

6415,These experiments demonstrate reliable resolution of retrotransposon and exogenous virus insertions via ONT sequencing.

6452,You have extremely high protection against serious illness from Delta.
6453,You have EXTREMELY high protection against death from Delta.
6454,The vaccines work.
6455,They work almost just as good at protecting you against Delta as Alpha and others.
6456,Unfortunately I don't think that's the case for most people.

6460,Gonna be an interesting day.
6461,wow
6462,I remember early into the pandemic you had some predictions saying anywhere from 20 million up to 80 million people just in the United States had already contracted the virus and this was like March 2020.
6463,Very smart moves again from Texas i see.
6464,Leading the world in stupidity.

6466,I agree.
6467,Masks are something that were necessary to mitigate risk.

6474,It’s disheartening that there just isn’t a lot of studies in Delta in children vs the others.
6475,I don’t know if this is actually worse for children or if it’s just a numbers game.
6476,Hospitals have their own standardized code system though.
6477,It's supposed to be the same across the country.
6478,Mine was super early in the vaccination process before pharmacies got involved in Georgia.
6479,The hospital running the vaccination site in Alabama started calling the HR departments of large companies in Georgia within driving range to offer it to their employees since the turnout was so low.
6480,"In fact, turnout was so low at that site that my initial second dose scheduled for a Friday got bumped up because within the time difference between shot 1 and shot 2 the site basically was forced to go to 4 days open because demand was too low to keep it open M-F."

6517,Walmart is requiring masks now for employees in surging counties but not customers this time.
6518,That tells me this round of mask mandates likely won't be as wide reaching as last years.
6519,I expect similar from some other private companies in the coming days but I think customer mandates will be avoided by most stores like that.
6520,Thoughts?
6521,"well if a significant number of people get a third dose under the table, we will assume more people are vaccinated than not."

6534,66% of the Indian population have antibodies according to a recent study.

6537,&gt; We treat science like politics- a change signals weakness or evidence of past deceit.
6538,And there is a lot of things to blame and that includes many scientists (especially celebrity scientists on TV or twitter) claiming things in absolute and not being open to discussion or criticism.
6539,Many of even established scientists let the media and politicians control the narrative because they desire the attention and fear losing the funding for their research.
6540,All of them had spread the narrative that you have to accept whatever scientists say without question which is probably as ironic as it gets.
6541,"We've known for weeks there is not a substantial risk of transmission outside so this makes no sense and just fucks the credibility of federal level public health even further

6755,"One statistical effect to keep in mind for the vaccine is that currently ""has recently received the vaccine"" matches like 50x as many people as ""has recently had covid""."
6756,"So anecdotes about adverse effects need to be weighted by that, which I feel is very difficult for people to do."
6757,"&gt;Brazil plans to cancel its orders for Russia’s Sputnik V vaccine, Reuters reported Thursday, as Moscow seeks to shore up domestic supplies in the face of a coronavirus surge fueled by the Delta variant."
6758,Brazil would be the second Latin American country to cancel its Sputnik V order after Guatemala did so this week.
6759,"Two others, Argentina and Mexico, have complained of second-dose shortages amid Russia’s own campaign to kickstart its lagging vaccination drive."
6760,"Unlike Guatemala, which faced a delivery delay of a previous Sputnik V order, Reuters reported that Brazil’s Health Minister Marcelo Queiroga said its cancelation was due to lapsed deadlines in the registration process with the national health regulator."
6761,Brazil had signed a contract to import 10 million doses from Russia in March.
6762,Its pharmaceutical company Uniao Quimica is reportedly still planning to manufacture Sputnik V locally for export to neighboring countries that had approved its use.
6763,"Queiroga added that Brazil has also canceled a $316-million contract for 20 million doses of India’s Covaxin vaccine, Reuters reported."
6764,"First Guatemala to cancel, and now Brazil."
6765,Argentina and Mexico next to cancel Sputnik?
6766,For how long time has Russia known that they could not fulfill the Sputnik orders for Guatemala and Brazil?
6767,they introduced Sputnik Light (only dose 1) and started to investigate AstraZeneca for second dose months ago.
6768,I don’t understand why forced vaccination is the solution.
6769,New data shows the vaccines don’t prevent catching covid and don’t prevent spreading it.
6770,"But they are good at preventing severe cases, hospitalization and deaths."
6771,So anyone who decides to take the vaccine is protected.
6772,Whether people around them have the vaccine or not does not matter since vaccinated people can catch it from either.
6773,For most people it’s a choice at this point whether they risk the consequences of covid or not.
6774,So why not let people make the choice?
6775,The hospitalization rates are low enough that we don’t need to worry about medical collapse anymore.
6776,If you are vaccinated you have nothing to worry about.
6777,And vaccinating everyone is not going to make covid disappear.
6778,"As the article says, here immunity is not something they is going to happen."

6784,"It’s because we’re now getting data about why Delta is much more fit than other variants, and it’s because it can replicate much faster and result in 1000x the viral load faster."
6785,That means it can get a jump on your immune response (including more than your antibodies can neutralize) until your body ramps up.
6786,"That also means you’re infectious sooner, and shed much more virus than for the variant we got used to last year."
6787,"For vaccinated people, while your immune system is ramping up you may be shedding enough virus to be infectious."
6788,[removed]
6789,"Correction : The vaccinated and 99.65% of those who are unvaccinated and get Covid, avoid death."
6790,"If you are unvaccinated, there is a small percentage chance you'll get Covid."
6791,"Therefore, if you're unvaccinated, there's a .03% chance you will die."
6792,If you have no co-morbitities that percentage is even lower.
6793,That's not a chance I'm willing to take.
6794,How soon till everyone is recommended to get a third shot?
6795,Soooo this moron says the people trying to get into the US from Mexico are bad because they might be spreading covid... Then prohibits requiring masks and vaccines... which is gonna help spread covid.
6796,Got it.

6810,This already happened there.
6811,"Part of the problem is that the symptomatic vaccinated populations with mild cold, sinus infection or allergy-like symptoms will likely believe they don't have covid and unknowingly contribute to spread in the community."
6812,There are places that implemented a mask mandate last year that refuse to implement one this year.
6813,The places that have implemented one are facing pushback just over the masks.
6814,"No, a lockdown is not coming for most of the US."
6815,What people aren’t really mentioning as well is if you do test positive you are still required to isolate!
6816,"I am vaxxed and tested positive, on day 2 of my isolation."
6817,I would much rather have not caught covid even if I am ‘just’ experiencing flu symptoms.
6818,"Also, it seemed like it was only going to be a mild cold on Tuesday."
6819,"There's really no reason not to believe delta won't surge, recede, and then surge over and over again, just like the original COVID-19 variants did prior to vaccines rolling out."
6820,It's okay to be sad that someone died because people filled his head with poison and lies.

6839,"This is the same moron who told us he wouldn't do state mandates during the start of the pandemic because ""Texas is a big place and each community should take its own steps to mitigate covid-19."""
6840,Now it's do whatever the fuck I say because my political career is taking a hit and I'm hoping this will save me.
6841,We’re triggered because you didn’t understand that the point of the comment was to point out Abbot/Conservative Hypocrisy.
6842,That was the only and entire point of the comment.
6843,"You just assumed that person was anti-big government, but I think everyone should be anti-hypocrite."
6844,"&gt; If 2/3rds of Indians have antibodies it means Delta blew through more than 900,000,000 people in a few months and killed ten times the official tally."
6845,"No, I agree with this part."
6846,But that is because India was pretty much unaffected by COVID until then.
6847,That was their first major wave and like 1% of their population was vaccinated at the time.
6848,The US has over 50% of the population vaccinated and a bunch more that already go the virus in the first and second waves.
6849,I think that is a big difference between India and the US.

**BUT** what you forget to take into account is 0% measures against the influenza epidemic except for some vaccin shots."
6851,The first 9 weeks of the corona epidemic took out 9768 people = 155 people / day.
6852,And that is with the country on full lockdown and in panic mode.
6853,So what is your point?
6854,"More Democrat voters in the next election, then."
6855,"The vaccine exposes your body to a controlled amount of the spike sequence, allowing you to mount a rapid immune response when exposed to the real thing."
6856,"The initial viral load can then be partly or fully neutralized by your already-trained immune system, lessening the severity of disease."
6857,"If you're unvaccinated and get infected, your body is rapidly being exposed to that sequence anyway via the replicating live virus."
6858,Adding some vaccine into the mix wouldn't do anything helpful in the short term.
6859,Delta will burn through the pop fast.
6860,So putting your head down for a month or two might be a viable strategy combined with vaccination.
6861,"But looking at chickenpox, everyone usually did come in contact with it eventually."
6862,Yes!
6863,My family and I shared a beach house together all last week (they are all vaccinated as well).

6876,Might be doing the math wrong.
6877,Do you guys think another lockdown is coming due tk the delta variant?
6878,I thought with vaccines getting more common the things would get better
6879,Everything is dumber in Texas.
6880,Is the area known to have substantially different demographics?
6881,I am sure you can find out from the detail report.

6910,"The vaccines do not prevent you from contracting the virus, it's not a shield."
6911,It is reinforcements for your immune system to battle the infection.
6912,"Therefore reducing severity of the infection, often times to the point of being asymptomatic."
6913,"In theory it should reduce the viral load you give off when contagious, if everyone has this benefit, we can go back to normal."
6914,But not everones does
6915,I should clarify my statement.
6916,"I mean that if most of the planet is vaccinated/immune, there will then be evolutionary pressure on the virus to produce vaccine-escaping mutations."
6917,"By ""evolutionary pressure,"" I am referring to some type of evolutionary selection event (i.e."
6918,mass vaccination).

6922,"Yeah, breaks from Reddit have helped me sometimes, especially at a few points when I got pulled in to arguments a little too often."
6923,Led to me spending more of my time angry than I wanted.
6924,"There are lots of fun parts about Reddit, good communities, but sometimes it can also be a bit of a black hole where you argue with strangers about covid or who knows what else."
6925,"No need to apologize, I understand the need to rant!"
6926,In this area absolutely
6927,How effective are mask mandates?
6928,I would argue that they are potentially as effective as seatbelt laws.
6929,"Sure people ignore seatbelt laws and they are more at risk of death in an accident, people still drive past the speed limit and break traffic laws which increase their risk of an accident, and most people actually wear seatbelts that are not fitted properly to their bodies because they don't even realize the fit is not just about comfort."
6930,"Nevertheless, death rates from auto accidents drop where seatbelt laws are in effect."
6931,Car seat laws have protected children and infants - these laws evolve to become more protective of the vulnerable.
6932,"Seatbelt laws are also not costless, and seatbelts are no replacement for driving safely, but in terms of harm reduction - like masks, they work."
6933,&gt;  What will it take to demask again?
6934,"well for starters, the people that need to wear masks to start wearing masks?"
6935,can't take it off if it wasn't on

6963,"I see the distinction you're trying to make, but sadly it's one without a difference."
6964,We need to start holding people accountable for their bad choices.

6969,They only believe in limited government when it’s convenient to them and their message
6970,The question is how they are going to make money out of this?
6971,Wow those are very specific examples.
6972,"Here’s a couple more, how about the freedom to stab someone, or maybe take a shit in the middle of the street."
6973,It’s freedom right.
6974,"How about the freedom for the people of Austin to democratically choose what they want to do, like mandate masks of the hospitals are having a surge."
6975,"But nope, Gov Fuckhead has to stick his authoritarian nose in everything, overriding our freedom with his choice."
6976,Get real bro.
6977,Was it a rapid test or PCR?
6978,He will directly be responsible for *very* preventable deaths.

6986,Not broken out anyway so goodness only knows.
6987,"But to be fair with this asymptomatic thing, I’m not going to go get a q-tip shoved up my nose for funsies either."

7155,Yeah CDC has been so good at releasing info lol.
7156,Didn't admit it was airborne until a year after the pandemic.
7157,Didn't admit people with vaccinations could spread it until news reports forced them to.
7158,Didn't admit children could get vanilla Covid until news reports forced them to.
7159,Im gonna go with reports of children being put in ICUs at much more alarming rates than the previous strain over what the CDC has said.

7321,Unless you were in close contact with someone who had a confirmed case.
7322,"Otherwise no symptoms, no reason to get tested."
7323,But agree this is data we need...
7324,Why is everyone outside of this thread acting like the latest CDC study confirms that vaccinated people spread it just as much as the unvaccinated?
7325,"From the actual study:

&gt;Finally, Ct values obtained with SARS-CoV-2 qualitative RT-PCR diagnostic tests might provide a crude correlation to the amount of virus present in a sample and can also be affected by factors other than viral load.††† Although the assay used in this investigation was not validated to provide quantitative results, there was no significant difference between the Ct values of samples collected from breakthrough cases and the other cases."
7326,This might mean that the viral load of vaccinated and unvaccinated persons infected with SARS-CoV-2 is also similar.
7327,"However, microbiological studies are required to confirm these findings."
7328,Notice the use of the word might a lot?
7329,Also the last sentence.
7330,The fact is that we just have to wait for more data before we know for sure.

7333,I'm having a really hard time feeling even a shred of sympathy for people who are this deliberately stupid.
7334,Big picture's important too!
7335,They can see what is different about Delta specifically that has eluded the vaccine that did not happen with others.
7336,It's somehow hopeful it prevented virus load in the others.

7413,And some comments here said they were getting a booster or going to another state to get one.
7414,"Honestly, it's probably not significant enough to make a difference in the numbers."
7415,Basically the idea of a vaccine is to make your body think it is under attack from the virus without the actual danger.
7416,So your immune system kicks into gear and if and when the actual virus shows up your defenses have been primed and you shouldn't be 'overwhelmed'.
7417,If you have covid for real your immune system has already tried to kick into full gear and a vaccine shouldn't make any difference as its too late.
7418,"Five kids ages 17, 10, 7, 6 and 17 months..."
7419,"No, the vaccines are still presently effective."
7420,"But what about a few months from now, or even a year?"
7421,This thing is still out there and replicating.
7422,You can't reason with those who don't want to abandon their ego or disinformation.
7423,Alberta is doing something nobody else is doing though.
7424,Yep.
7425,I’m okay with that.
7426,I’m not locking down nor should we be shutting schools down for idiots
7427,"He might have been spared by the ""Grace of God"" but it also involved the knowledge and work of the medical community that he was so quick to dismiss, disparage and denigrate before he got sick."
7428,Yeah.

7430,[removed]
7431,"Im going to take a wild guess and assume we’ll see 200,000 a day at the peak of this thing before it starts dive bombing back down"
7432,I can tell you they will get wasted.
7433,USA is the land of waste.
7434,I don’t think anyone here would logically argue against that.
7435,"I just wanted to put this out there for the person who inevitably says “see, the vaccine doesn’t work”."
7436,We both agree.
7437,"yeah, because there’s no way this is a significant number of people"
7438,"

“If you’re vaccinated and with others that are vaccinated you do not need to wear a mask “


Except vaccinated people ARE spreading covid."
7439,I thought the point of vaccines were to stop the spread?
7440,"True, and a booster targeting Delta will help"
7441,&gt; [The data shows that protection against mortality from the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine is even higher – around 69% – for confirmed cases who had their second dose at least 7 days prior to their positive test.

&gt; [**When combined with the estimated protection against becoming a case, this is equivalent to an estimated 97% protection** against mortality in individuals vaccinated with 2 doses of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine."

*^((these are pre-Delta numbers which show even lower efficacy all around:https://www.gov.uk/government/news/vaccines-highly-effective-against-b-1-617-2-variant-after-2-doses)^)*  
Between the reduced efficacy of Delta against a 2-dosed vaccinated person, waning antibodies over time (not a significant number yet), people who are only vaccinated with the J&amp;J vaccine which is less effective than *this* against Delta, and that only 1/5 of Americans who are ""vaccinated"" are merely 1-dose vaccinated.. it's not a stretch to say these vaccines on a national level are reducing our severity by about ~half."
7444,"So instead of a 1% mortality rate, you're looking at a ~0.5% mortality rate."
7445,The bread and butter of the vaccine is the ability to stop transmission.
7446,Reducing the severity of disease is a secondary feature.
7447,"When you look at these graphs and numbers that promote the efficacy of the vaccine, they're *mostly* touting the feature of resisting contraction."
7448,But this has less meaning when we're dealing with breakthrough clusters.
7449,I have a hard time imagining that we all cared about a 1% mortality rate last year and now no one cares about a .5% mortality rate.
7450,"And you'd have thought that the vaccine would reduce the chance for long-haul by at least half, if that's what it does for all the other symptoms."
7451,But the first data to come out on this (mostly against the older B.1.1.7 variant) is suggesting that [19% of vaccinated people are developing long term symptoms](https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/otpask/breakthrough_covid_infections_after_vaccination/).
7452,Surely those numbers will get more accurate over time but it's *suggesting* that your chances of long-haul COVID are not reduced even if you're vaccinated.
7453,That's something to worry about.
7454,Impressive.
7455,They finally identified an audience dumber than Faux News viewers.
7456,Don't care.
7457,"We won't, it will becoming endemic with hopefully far less mortality in aggregate"
7458,"Perspective, at least with regards to breakthrough case hospitalizations... 

https://www.kff.org/policy-watch/covid-19-vaccine-breakthrough-cases-data-from-the-states/"
7459,"Only reason I brought it up is because with prior variants, the vaccine did lower viral loads in vaccinated individuals."
7460,I’m just highlighting how our understanding has to adapt to evolving variants
7461,This article is reporting on a variety of studies as well as quotes from doctors.
7462,"It looks like most of the studies are from patients who were hospitalized from Covid reporting on brain fog and other impaired functions, which is not surprising - a viral infection that sends you to the hospital is going to take a long time to recover from, and may lead to permanent damage."
7463,"None of that is unusual, and the vaccines are very good at preventing cases serious enough to require hospitalization."
7464,"The quotes from doctors (who it should be noted, even though they are experts and their opinions are valuable, are still just speculating) all range from ""we don't know, but we'll keep studying it"" to ""I don't expect to see permanent damage."""
7465,"Basically, this article uses some real but not worrying data, some vague interviews, and has turned it into a scary article that makes you think ""covid causes alzheimers"" without ever actually stating that or even proving that."
7466,The comparison against flu is based on info from Covid variants in 2020.
7467,"Already the picture is changing with Delta - [overall still very rare, but hospitalizations have been going up this year ](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/06/04/health/covid-flu-hospitalizations-children.html) compared to flu."
7468,"In other countries with resistance to public health measures leading to overwhelmed healthcare systems like Brazil for example, Covid has been especially devastating to the pediatric population and they don't know exactly why."
7469,"Covid variants are all new, so at this point all data is still emerging."
7470,I think precaution is warranted.
7471,"No need for complete isolation, but masking is a reasonable precaution until we have more long term data."
7472,But seriously I'm just not gonna get it.
7473,Lol
7474,"Sorry, I thought you were responding to the post itself, not to someone's comment"
7475,The only thing I'm worried about is some variant that affects children under 12 more since I have two and they can't get vaccinated.
7476,"I don't expect the world to stop for them, but I do expect to have options and a plan in place when school starts here in NJ after Labor Day."
7477,We did remote most of last year and could do another 2-3 months if infections get out of hand here.
7478,"I know it sucks for the teachers, but perhaps a breakthrough infection would be worse?"
7479,Tough to say...
7480,I'm sure we'll still have mask mandates and distancing until vaccines are approved.
7481,I also expect that not returning to the office in Manhattan while riding on a Petri dish to sit in another Petri dish and then come back on a different petri dish than the one I rode on to get there will be an option and for that option to be protected by law until my kids can get vaccinated.
7482,"Judging by what Cuomo said the other day, I doubt it will be."
7483,"Of all the things I hate about the messaging, it's the idea that we MUST send unvaccinated kids to school while we also MUST return to the office."
7484,One of these things two things absolutely needs to be optional until kids under 12  can get vaccinated.
7485,"P-Town is full of old Victorian homes that have been converted to shops, restaurants, art stores."
7486,"It's packed during the summer and all the indoor venues are tiny, and packed, and OMG it's crowded."

7497,I'm enabling them to suppress workers while trying to keep my family safe.
7498,Options suck
7499,Isn't part of the reason this is generally not talked about because it would effectively reward people for getting sick?
7500,If we're trying to avoid an increase in cases that would seem counterproductive
7501,"Yes, but we are dealing with today and tomorrow."
7502,"Dude, I’m doing my PhD in virology and I have no fuckin clue what you said"
7503,"5, 4 of which were vaccinated"
7504,Really?
7505,I can still attach a magnet to my skin months later /s
7506,Personally I think I have a higher chance of dying in a warzone than from this new SARS.
7507,that’s why OP italicized *each year*
7508,Lol yea “centuries” ago.
7509,We are talking about what covid did in about a year with mitigation rules
7510,We are truly living through the Happening.
7511,Damn you M. Night
7512,The possibilities are so exciting.
7513,"Some scientists might also be onto the first successful RSV vaccine, and a flu shot that’s good for all known strains of flu!"

7516,Politics will start to play a bigger role.
7517,"You’ll also see people who have been sheltering decide they miss human interaction, well the non introverts."
7518,I hope they have dedicated teachers for that.
7519,Having teachers trying to do both (hybrid model) is awful.
7520,"Don't forget the RT cameras that were rolling, distributing this cheap PR effort around the world."
7521,"As long as news outlets keep ignoring the massive catastrophe that the Sputnik issue is causing in Latin America, the PR win for Putin will stand, even if he does not deliver a single dose of vaccine ever again."
7522,"mRNA technology isn't new at all, it's been studied with scrutiny for decades, and thanks to the massive extent of research it allowed quicker adoption for covid vaccines to move into huge clinical trials with 40,000+ people each and met every requirement for approval, with global collaboration, no funding barriers and vast amounts of independent health agencies reviewing every step."
7523,Even more so vaccines for corona viruses have been studied since 2003 following the SARS outbreak.
7524,"Nothing about this vaccine is ""experimental"""
7525,My company had planned to call everyone back after Labor Day.

7541,I guess anal sex transmits it
7542,"Maybe, maybe not."
7543,On the one hand you do present a good point that I will give you is probably more true than not.
7544,"On the other however the world doesn't always work that way, if I had a year paid+ time off work I could invest that time and money into some worthwhile ventures and I know all these people aren't squandering that opportunity."
7545,That would be higher than the rates pre vaccination (bad = hospitalized)...I call BS
7546,"&gt; This thing will not over until its over everywhere on thie planet, vaccine will not be the end game due to anti-vaxxers in this country."
7547,"Treatments, (before that, proper mask and masking, distancing) are the final way out."
7548,I don't know how you get from saying breakthroughs are common to saying that the anti-vaxxers are at fault.
7549,"Treatments might help, though we're a long time into this and still no closer."
7550,"Most people can't get proper masks or use them properly, distancing doesn't help much with an airborne virus, and cutting off social contacts will no longer fly because we wasted that tool in 2020 when the virus was less transmissible (which is the lesson we forgot from 1918: it can always get worse, so we should save things like masks for when things are at their very worst)."
7551,So the endgame is that it will never be over everywhere on the planet and we live with this as a permanent part of our lives.
7552,"If getting it once makes later exposures less bad, we'll be OK; if later exposures get worse, we'll live with lower life expectancy."
7553,But getting rid of the virus completely is impossible.
7554,"1 is true for regular covid, 2 is true for Delta."
7555,I hope that clears up some confusion.
7556,That's the reason we have to mask up again.
7557,"For regular covid, the vaccine decreased the the amount of virus shed by an infected person by 90%, so the CDC told vaccinated people they can take off their masks."
7558,Now we're finding that's not true with Delta.
7559,That’s what I’m so scared of!
7560,My husband is back at work but our 2 year old has cancer and i just don’t want her sick.

7563,That’s so beyond unreal - how is this not all over the news!
7564,"Of course, and the sovereign individual can be a rapist/murderer."
7565,What's your point?

7567,Yeah thanks but no thanks.
7568,I’m done.
7569,I’ve checked out.
7570,Those that don’t get the vaccine and also don’t mask can roll the dice and suffer the consequences if they get sick.
7571,I’m not gonna continue to live my life restricted and in fear because others won’t do their part too.
7572,And frankly I’m tired of the government putting the burden back on those that did their part instead of the people that are filling up hospital beds.
7573,Because it doesn’t require more than one sentence to explain the difference.
7574,Its simple greater coverage &gt; less coverage.

7603,I don't think that'll matter much.
7604,The cult will just turn on her.

7616,I don’t think so.
7617,I think people will eventually get burned out once they realize covid is here to stay.
7618,The shipyard I work at just said masks for all again regardless of immunization.
7619,I'm beyond livid that I have to put on a fucking mask again because half the goddamn people I work with are selfish assholes.
7620,Well that **would** be far more efficient
7621,False.
7622,For the very rare blood clotting disorders (TTS) - these were observed but were in line with what would be expected in the general population - and crucially lower than in those with Covid-19
7623,Lol you’re too dumb to realize you’re literally hurting the goal of mass vaccination.
7624,Great point.
7625,Can’t wait to see more insider trading come to light.
7626,That one that makes Windows :b.
7627,Remind me about that when we're all dead from a variant that can't be targeted by vaccines.
7628,"I can agree but also disagree, Delta is going to burn through very rapidly based on every other area of the world who got hit by it."
7629,Areas like Florida already primed in the thick of it will be pulling out of the delta peak by end of August.
7630,Its likely this may pass by the end of october-ish and this type of preventative measure may reduce spread in regions somewhat where enacted.
7631,I’m so scared of this.
7632,It’s a bad precedent to set that a 100% vaxxed campus can’t remove masks.
7633,Who and when can we then?
7634,We think he got it from his dad.
7635,Who was vaccinated.
7636,But he came up positive too.
7637,We think his dad got it from an unvaccinated person at his workplace.
7638,I firmly believe the CDC is behind on data on breakthrough infections.
7639,"Including his dad, I now know of at least 14 vaccinated people infected in my family group."
7640,"All separate from each other, just incidently getting infected around the same time."
7641,Some of our local businesses have shut down today because their whole vaccinated staff tested positive.

7654,"One of the weird things about the mask controversy has been the way experts will talk about the flaws in cloth and surgical masks, and about the higher viral load emitted by people with Delta, and then act like the masks will do what the vaccines can't."
7655,"Maybe if everyone wore authentic n95 masks, but no one can get them."
7656,"My cynical view is that masks are recommended more as a check on behavior; they make indoor socializing less fun, so people will limit their indoor contacts, and that may help cut down on spread."

7727,On top of that it looks like a decent number will get it once it's approved and/or required by their employer.

7811,My brother in law is an electrician for the IBEW and a city employee.
7812,"My uncles were these kind of guys, solid, hard working dudes providing for their families and don’t fuck around."
7813,"However bro in law has “side jobs and is extremely sketchy and not someone I am inclined to believe if the story doesn’t add up (as it usually doesn’t with him) so take this story with a grain of salt…

His father (one of the worst human beings I have ever met and absolute waste of a hospital bed) died and while visiting him in the hospital, he apparently caught covid and gave it to my sister."
7814,"She was only mildly symptomatic but got tested anyway, and she was positive."
7815,But he apparently tested negative twice and was the only person she had been seeing?
7816,As soon as he went back to work (he had not been staying with my sister) this “quarantine” period just so happened to be his father dying and him going up north for “peace and quiet”) there was an “outbreak on the job” and he “caught” covid.
7817,I didn’t realize HE was the outbreak.
7818,But I guess he lied about both being symptomatic and getting tested because he got REALLY sick.
7819,Long covid.
7820,Was apparently contagious longer than the however-many-day period.
7821,He ended up getting convalescent plasma therapy and can’t get the vaccine for several more months.
7822,He still isn’t 100% back to normal from what I hear.
7823,Anyway.
7824,"My point is that between the unions and working for the city, I am more inclined to believe they did their due diligence than that my brother in law was telling the truth."
7825,And I can’t believe someone as smart as my sister actually believes it’s more likely she caught it from the guy at the check out counter at CVS because she “forgot to purell”.

7827,I see what you did there.
7828,"&gt;Nafziger said almost every one of the patients in the hospital who did not get the vaccine, now said they wish they had."

7851,“Vaccinated people are angry” was the quote of the day.
7852,No thanks.
7853,I've done my part in this.
7854,Can you define intellectually honest vaccine hesitancy?
7855,"Better yet, only offer it to those who are already vaccinated, with a 2 week grace period for your first shot."
7856,I want antivaxxers seething and foaming at the mouth while their vaxxed friends flash cash around and laugh at them.
7857,&gt; But the identity of the agency's mystery client remains unclear.
7858,Very convincing.
7859,"The second link has this line:

&gt; Many posted both pro- and anti-vaccination messages to create ""false equivalency"", the study found."
7860,"The whole ""Russian Troll"" mania is a hoax."
7861,"Its some tiny companies posting random messages, anything they think will get traction and have no apparent goal other than gaining eyeballs."
7862,There is no evidence that they have any impact or that they try to.
7863,Its like worrying about 5G in your vaccine.
7864,Cause certain politicians wanted it to be and their marketing wing of their party pushed it on the news/social media.
7865,Now the unvaccinated are dying and the politicians are too stubborn to change their rhetoric.
7866,[deleted]
7867,"Wait, I thought I was registered in a computer system?"
7868,Is that not true.
7869,Then where did all the data go when I had my vaccine.
7870,"I'm not disagreeing with you, I just always assumed there was a database."
7871,Right there with you.
7872,Federal jobs are high in demand and many of us will be happy to prowl usajobs and take these guys jobs if they don’t want to do the absolute minimum.

7874,Whatever it takes at this point.
7875,I have a colleague who ranted to me about how pissed he was when his wife tried to take their kids to go get vaccinated while he was TDY with me.
7876,Which an EUA vaccine is definitely not...

7895,Unless the item of contention is already covered by a negotiated agreement?
7896,It's mostly part of it being a novel virus.
7897,The reason why this is a pandemic is the amount of people susceptible to hospitalization and death.
7898,To suggest that it will lead to severe infection over and over goes against what's known in science.
7899,"Yes, anything is possible, but all pandemics end."
7900,Did they backtrack to those who already had it in any form?
7901,The problem I have with these app things are there are no inter state workings as vaccines are managed at the state level.
7902,I am also fully vaccinated and don’t want to show my “papers” out of principal.
7903,It has everything to do with how slow people are lol
7904,"Besides, there have been incentives."
7905,Didn't work.
7906,Now they get the stick.
7907,Disney isn’t even in Orlando
7908,Just paid the deposit for my daughter's private school spot and I'm praying that things don't get so bad here that she ends up at home anyway.
7909,UUUUUUgh what did we even go through all this for?
7910,"We shouldn't be here, but we are, and I am trying to take it in stride but it's hard to articulate how frustrated I am."
7911,116 hospitals have 399 COVID pts?
7912,So an average of about 4 pts per hospital?
7913,&gt;	There must be some agencies/providers that administered shots without keeping good records of the name.
7914,Absolutely this.
7915,My brother wasn’t given any kind of proof and his name wasn’t taken.
7916,"He had a paper telling him when to come back for the second dose, but it was generic and passed out to everyone who got their first dose that day."
7917,"He went with his coworkers and bosses, so it’s not an issue for him at the moment, but if he were to lose that job and look for something else, I don’t know what he would be supposed to do."
7918,"On top of that, he and his household all caught coronavirus early on."
7919,"He and his wife were a little under the weather, but the kids showed no symptoms at all."
7920,"So he had the virus, had the vaccine, but can’t prove he had the vaccine."
7921,Sorry but my mother and law has had three strokes and such for three weeks after she got it.
7922,Needless to say she will be passing soon.
7923,And another person that I know got it and she does within days of a stroke.
7924,They were 54 and 41.
7925,No thank you
7926,"I am not crazy about student loan forgiveness, your correct, unless its backtracked to those who rushed to pay it off or worked two jobs throughout college to have as little as possible."
7927,What I am for is removal of all interest on student loans.
7928,Literally remove everything owed that isnt the principal.
7929,"If someone paid 40,000 back already ignore all the interest accrued and count that instead toward the principal instead."
7930,Just removing how the interest has both accrued in the past and in the future would make a huge difference.
7931,0% interest for college loans should be the future but we shouldnt have people pay less than other people who paid immediately because they took out loans.
7932,"You do know about probabilities, right?"
7933,"I mean if you say that something not being 100% disqualifies the effect, I sure hope you shun antibiotics, all forms of birth control, all vaccines etc."
7934,Unvaccinated are meaningfully higher risk and show rather poor public spirit and/or math skills... neither of which is something employees love in hires.
7935,It's considerate that this nan is endorsing them too 🤷
7936,"God is punishing Alabama for failing to socially distance, wear masks and get vaccinated."
7937,😂 well done
7938,It’ll be interesting to see your county seems to be one of the most vaccinated.
7939,I’ll keep an eye on cases hopefully the magically start falling.
7940,"Here’s the thing, though."
7941,"In the clinical trials, (correct me if I’m wrong), Pfizer wasn’t routinely testing people, only if they showed symptoms."
7942,"However, J&amp;J was."
7943,"So if lots of people are testing positive but feel no symptoms, that’s about the same thing as what was told to us when we first got the vaccines: that you can still catch it but you just won’t feel it."
7944,So publishing that data won’t necessarily help and could possibly even make people more scared than they have to be.
7945,Especially if lots of people are testing positive but 88% (as found in UK study) have no symptoms.
7946,"I read this as “kills” and I was like “shit, the Corona is even killing the hospital beds now?"
7947,"!”  
Enough Reddit for today, brain stopped working."
7948,Please don’t do the “all lives matter” thing.
7949,"BIPOC communities continue to have lower vaccination rates, on average, than white communities, for a variety of reasons."
7950,"They’re also less likely to be able to take sick time or self isolate, and more likely to live in conditions where Covid spreads rapidly."
7951,Older adults and disabled adults are still the most likely groups to die of Covid.
7952,Even fully vaccinated people with illnesses and treatments that are immunosuppressive are vulnerable to hospitalisation and death from the delta variant.
7953,Exactly.
7954,"There's a group saying it's nothing to worry about, and some that feel their odds of getting it are less than the odds of having a bad reaction to the vaccine."

8043,*
8044,Exactly!
8045,The CDCs own data suggests that the likelihood of vaccinated people getting a breakthrough infection is extremely low.
8046,Less than 1% of vaccinated people have been reported as getting a breakthrough infection.
8047,Getting an infection that is serious enough to cause hospitalization or death is even lower at .004% of the vaccinated population.
8048,"But then, at the same time this information is being published, Walensky goes on CNN and tells people that “1 or 2 people out of 20 will get a breakthrough infection”."
8049,That’s fucking nuts!
8050,This out of control flip flopping from the CDC and it’s leadership is not helping anyone.
8051,So you’re never interacting with service staff?
8052,"No, it isn’t."
8053,It’s like people getting paid to do something we need them to do that they otherwise wouldn’t.
8054,Quit crying.
8055,Good point.
8056,They either have some sort of immunity...or they are dead.

8059,Its not about freedom its about left vs right like always
8060,"You're right, but most of us think they're fucking idiots and an embarrassment to the profession."
8061,"there are no studies on Delta yet

err on the side of caution and just assume you can transmit"
8062,Classical blame the messenger.
8063,Don't lay responsibility on anyone but the people refusing to get a vaccine.
8064,[removed]
8065,"First, the vaccine does not seem to protect as well against the delta variant."
8066,"So, there can be infections from unvaccinated to vaccinated people."
8067,And not everyone (kids &gt;12 years) can get the vaccination yet.
8068,"So, yes, we are all in it together."
8069,70% of adults is not enough.
8070,The story has her picture.

8076,Our options...appear to be limited.
8077,Welcome back to nature.
8078,Lol you don't see your hypocrisy?
8079,You're also assuming I'm anti vax when that is absolutely not the case.
8080,All because I want to have a non political conversation.
8081,You are just as bad as you think the other side is
8082,"I read that with delta, just one minute of exposure is enough."
8083,"&gt; Before it was ""restrictions until widespread vaccine availability"" now its restrictions until ""?????????"""
8084,and i find that deeply unsettling.
8085,"If you thought it ended at ""availability"" then that's on you."
8086,"The basic plan is

- availability

- widespread vaccination; ideally, everyone who is eligible

- the virus has no where to spread, and new case numbers plummet

- slower virus reproduction, slower rate of mutation, longer amount of time that current vaccines remain effective

That gets us back to flying level, and then it's a matter of maintenance as needed: update vaccines for new strains, temporary, seasonal / location base restrictions if clusters emerge."
8087,"If metrics (e.g., case numbers, positivity rate) go low enough again we can pull back on restrictions again/more."
8088,"The Delta variant being so much more transmissible, including via the vaccinated, is what threw things for a loop."
8089,I would not be surprised if a much more dangerous variant emerges in the next 10 years.
8090,"Hopefully, we'll be better prepared then."
8091,"This myth (of vaccinated individuals shedding the virus) is almost as dumb, if not dumber than [fan death](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fan_death)"
8092,This is honestly not okay.
8093,Stores should not be doing mandates unless or until the majority of states have done it.
8094,May God bring the so-called pastor to repentance
8095,$100 doesn’t go as far today as it used to.
8096,What about those of us who got it for nothing months ago?
8097,You’re part of a society whether you want to be or not.
8098,Facts change.
8099,Vaccinated people carry as much viral load as unvaccinated people.
8100,That is a fact now.
8101,It sucks that it might make the unvaccinated more apathetic.
8102,I hate it.

8116,FEMA is paying out death benefits for covid deaths that can help you cover funeral costs.

8123,I can't wait until vaccines are mandatory
8124,It’s time to tax churches
8125,This is the real sticking point.
8126,The GOP fan base thinks DeSantis is amazing for his COVID response.
8127,"Problem is, his COVID response was... nothing."
8128,The individual counties created and enforced their own mandates.
8129,Do we have empirical evidence of that?
8130,I’m pro vax and have been vax since April.

8152,Let alone I see no way it's even feasible with our current level of tech.
8153,It's like everyone at work getting a bonus except for you despite you do more work.
8154,Of course it's a punishment and I would be upset and clearly other people think this way.

8177,"Biden is a miracle worker, he made the best of a bad situation"
8178,Right and therein lies the problem.
8179,"People who are finally realizing they need to get vaccinated hear news like this and think, ""well, what's the point if I'm going to get sick anyway?"""
8180,and then they don't go do it and then we have bigger problems.
8181,Btw you getting vaxxed wasn't silly at all.
8182,It was literally the best thing you could do for yourself.
8183,I just want to provide an additional data point from Singapore where we have Delta dominating and a bit more than half the population fully vaccinated with mRNA and increasing rapidly.
8184,This [chart](https://www.moh.gov.sg/images/librariesprovider5/covid-19-chart-(pr)/fig-4-(29-jul).jpg) shows local cases in the last 28 days.
8185,"We test, quarantine and contact trace pretty aggressively here so even if you're completely asymptomatic, you will get tested if identified as a close contact."
8186,"Delta seems to create infections pretty often even among the vaccinated, but the key thing is that you are still very well protected against severe symptoms and disease."

8203,[removed]
8204,"Will you share your data on the overlap, I think that would be interesting to see."
8205,Lot of exaggeration here.
8206,Quick summary - the CDC says they believe the vaccines are 75-85% effective at preventing infection and 90% effective at preventing severe disease.
8207,They are mostly concerned about increased transmission from the delta variant.
8208,"Yes there is, just published yesterday in NEJM."
8209,"Study of breakthrough infections in healthcare workers in Israel showed 19% had symptoms &gt;6 weeks:

8232,This is not an uncommon sentiment where I live.
8233,Have fun eventually catching it.
8234,"Well yes, of course."
8235,It just seems like a feeble effort that’s totally out of my hands.
8236,I think we're approaching a time where even if you are vaccinated you have to worry that you could very well be asymptomatically infected and pass it to someone who is also vaccinated but who is older or compromised in some way.
8237,(Or to someone who would also be asymptomatic but could pass it on to someone at risk.)
8238,"And we still don't know about long COVID and ""mild"" breakthrough infections."
8239,Hope everyone enjoyed their 10 weeks of freedom!
8240,With unvaccinated COVID patients*
8241,It's power politics.
8242,"God is the ultimate power, and doesn't work with nature but above it."
8243,The pastor is God's only representative.
8244,If the pastor agrees with the health authorities then it means common sense is superior to the pastor's word (which by proxy is God's word).
8245,Followers gain secondary power in the church from the pastor by proving their loyalty ie also ignoring common sense.
8246,The more vocal their loyalty the higher the power.
8247,"Getting sick, dying etc means the victim wasn't loyal or faithful enough."
8248,Win-win.
8249,It's the structure of a religion where God is outside of Nature.
8250,It is crazy.
8251,Disclaimer I'm vaccinated.
8252,"It Kinda concerns me now, because essentially the CDC is saying vaccines down work."
8253,Because you can still get and pass covid.
8254,"Why mask if your vaccinated, if they work?"
8255,[The Israeli study is an outlier because they screwed up the denominator](https://twitter.com/dvir_a/status/1420059124700700677?s=20)

8258,Well according to kurezgt in your body you have memory cells which last for a very very long time the problem however are the anti bodies which don’t last too long
8259,"Also, there is a strong risk of becoming sterile due to death from Covid."
8260,But yeah.
8261,My son’s bus driver tested positive despite being double vaccinated and now the whole bus has to quarantine.
8262,I’m so mad at the situation and at every unvaccinated person who is enabling the ongoing spread of COVID.
8263,"&gt;As of Thursday, 882 people were tied to the Provincetown outbreak."
8264,"Among those living in Massachusetts, 74% of them were fully immunized, yet officials said the vast majority were also reporting symptoms."
8265,Seven people were reported hospitalized.
8266,Something tells me Israel's data is going to be proven correct.
8267,I shit my brains out after the first shot second was fine.
8268,To be fair I can not say for certain if there was something I ate that didn’t agree with me lol
8269,450 vs 1400 hospitalized and 118 vs over 300 in ICU is still a bit off.
8270,I'm not saying it's not possible to reach there but I wouldn't start comparing this to January.
8271,It's also important to note that as community spread increases anyone admitted at the hospital for something unrelated to covid and tests positive will count as covid hospitalized.
8272,In NJ they have reported for vs with in regards to vaccinated folks only (for some reason).
8273,So for instance we had 92 vaccinated hospitalized who tested positive while admitted from December to April.
8274,"Of the 92, 30 were there for covid and the remaining were there for an unrelated reason."
8275,All 92 count as covid hospitalized.
8276,North Dakota is one of the few states who publishes for vs with.
8277,Right now it gets reported out they have 11 in ICU but only 2 are there for covid.
8278,Just something to keep in mind when reading numbers.
8279,If hospitals are already busy it's of course going to stress hospitals when covid increases but I believe it's important to get a full understanding of what's happening.
8280,I have never understood why every state doesn't report for vs with.
8281,I'm sure I'll be down voted like I always am here for posting data but saying it's not too far behind is simply not true
8282,It’s on them then.
8283,So you are ok with private employers requiring it?
8284,"If the answer is yes, every scenario you’ve just stated implies to them as well."
8285,I think they they should be allowed to require it as well.
8286,I’m just implying that they may encounter legal challenges or market challenges which may make it for more difficult for them.
8287,"I thought Sam Kendricks had been in the army, seems odd that he'd be squeamish of a vaccine."
8288,"&amp; while I get there's a whole ""I'm a world class athlete covid can't hurt me I'm so healthy"" even the smallest amount of reading would suggest that might not be the case -  so you're doing a coin flip on your sports career"
8289,How is it not?
8290,Do you not want the public reminded how important getting vaccinated is?
8291,Seems important enough to repeat once in awhile with confirmed new data.
8292,Reminds me of Manaus.
8293,I wouldn’t put much stock for implications of seropositivity for this.
8294,"sir, I work for corporate america."
8295,the devil gets envious of their behavior.
8296,I agree.
8297,We need to get people to stop trying to get extra shots and instead focus on helping the rest of the world.
8298,Also I think the mask recommendation is leading to some of this frustration.
8299,People are not as smart as the CDC gives them credit to be.
8300,I agree with the all the others who have criticized the CDC - message from a science standpoint solid a but behavioral science failed.
8301,Maybe but I it will depend on where and when.

8367,Oh good one!
8368,"This is likely not the reason why they're doing this, but I think this sort of testing may shed some light on the frequency of breakthrough cases."
8369,"It's clear that the vaccine is effective against hospitalization and death, but I wonder if there are a ton of asymptomatic positive cases among the vaccinated."
8370,True.
8371,"If I was in PR for them, I'd be pointing to the FACT that only 849 out of 162,000,000 vaccinated people have died as evidence that this thing does work."
8372,"I would continue to tell vaccinated people to live their life as normal, and encourage businesses to implement vaccine checks when possible."
8373,But there are still uncongruous messages.
8374,"They said being vaccinated doesn't mean you can't get infected, but so many public health policy recommendations seem to be based on the opposite."
8375,For example: universities not opening in-person teaching to unvaccinated people.
8376,That's just one example.
8377,Workplaces and federal agencies moving to require you being vaccinated to work is another example.
8378,"I am all for these requirements, but they are at odds with the reality that we can still spread the virus around even when we're vaccinated."
8379,Negative.
8380,It’s going to peak soon and we will be back to normal in no time.
8381,You made no sacrifices.
8382,"You followed government orders, peer pressure."
8383,You’re afraid of getting sick without addressing the sick migrants and open borders for flights.
8384,How scared is the government of the virus when they’re dispersing sick migrants are accepting visitors from violently ill plane passengers?
8385,"But sure, blame Americans you disagree with."
8386,"While you’re at it, look at how many black and Hispanic Americans are scared of this shot."
8387,Look where the variants largely come to fruition are from geologically
8388,"It is, but many of us don’t realize that until we get out (if we get out, I’m lucky)"
8389,Why?

8432,A lot of school policy and curriculum decisions are made by elected committees of local busybodies who are often science deniers themselves.
8433,But it doesn't mean that everyone thinks that way - ie what it means to be 'vegan'.
8434,It is of course not a good thing to be farming literal people - 'animals' with brains.
8435,Cannot say ALL of 'humanity' when not everyone all thinks the same.
8436,Really people simply literally just do not know better - people don't understand what they're doing - what they're eating.
8437,Therefore need to reach out to everyone by actually talking to people figure out how to get to people - to stop this stuff like farming - it simply isn't right.
8438,And on top of that I would even suggest forcefully stopping these animal farms directly - without harming anyone in the process ; ie evacuating / rescuing those as 'farm animals'.
8439,Stopping power to the huge factories - rescuing people..
8440,Though maybe if can do this with some like robotic remote control thing as people probably want to apprehend anyone trying this.
8441,And then like taking an angle grinder to a semi truck full of pigs and stuff - rescuing people..
8442,"So - yeah, make sure DO NOT harm anyone just rescue people - people like factory workers like make a diversion make them leave the factory to then rescue those trapped inside.. Stuff like that..  
  
And to do in some mass movement thing - mass produce portable greenhouses that grow algae like spirulina / chlorella to give to everyone to account for lack of factory farms gone."
8443,"All these given to people freely - given to everyone, even to each persons house - ensure people get food."
8444,These portable greenhouses also have built in or portable water distill to be able to supply clean fresh water.
8445,And even stuff like wind turbine included to mechanically power the water distill / stir the algae setup - just a compact thing given out to everyone freely.
8446,And climate change - this can be solved via construction of large pools of algae / re purpose swimming pools to grow algae - even use the same food algae like chlorella / spirulina - what this does is the algae soaks up the CO2 thus a way to solve climate change - this algae should be really fast at doing this / extremely easy to set up - just a drop of algae in a pond and it grows in the entire pond .
8447,"And that simple - this is much simpler than huge machines that removes CO2 - no, just simple algae can do that."
8448,"And then also need to help everyone change from fossil fuels / carbon producing stuff to renewables and such -- help people get wind power, wave energy power, solar - ie same concept with mass producing those portable greenhouses freely."
8449,And also stuff even fusion would be helpful.

8456,"And David Jacobs talked before about the aliens literally saying 'a virus was released into the atmosphere' in 2004, ie when SARS happened - and again saying 'will be released into the atmosphere ' in around 2017."

8581,I started wearing a mask in February of 2020 when the surgeon general said on Twitter not to buy masks but I did anyway because I knew I’d probably have to wear one to protect myself.
8582,I wore a mask until after I got vaccinated and the CDC issued that guidance in may.
8583,"Now that I’m fully vaccinated I have no desire to wear a mask again, there’s always going to be new variants."
8584,Masks were never meant to be a permanent measure just a stopgap until we got a vaccine.
8585,We need to learn to live with it

8645,We know that on both sides of the isle exist reactionaries who will just rabidly oppose whatever their opposites preach to them.

8703,This should really be celebrated.
8704,"I don't want COVID and aside from shopping, I rarely do anything indoors outside of my home anyway, but I am fine with the risks I assume by living my life as normal as a vaccinated person."
8705,The path forward is to mandate that everyone be vaccinated in order to enter any indoor spaces.
8706,Target the legislation at businesses.
8707,Any violations should be fined.
8708,That would essentially force everyone to either get vaccinated or remove themselves from society.
8709,The only exceptions granted should be if someone is immunocompromised or has some other legitimate medical basis to not be vaccinated.

8763,!
8764,Don’t let this thread get to you.
8765,People are just overwhelmed.
8766,They still cite the vaccines as having 75 percent or more protection against infection.
8767,"Thank you sir, may I have another in three to four weeks?"
8768,They brought this upon themselves.

8773,What deeply sad lives they live
8774,Right there with you.
8775,I feel Reddit and the news media have lost all perspective on this.
8776,The goals of lockdown have been accomplished.
8777,It's done.
8778,The vaccines are amazing and available to all who are at-risk other than those with rare medical conditions.
8779,Time to move on with our lives.
8780,lol does it make a difference.
8781,Disney on tour also requires vaccination from all who will work their shows throughout the country.
8782,needed this thank you

8791,"This'll blow through unvaccinated communities and fill the hospitals, and then the relationship between case counts and hospitalizations will weaken considerably, and we'll all stop caring so much."
8792,Oh I know sorry if I sounded aggressive I was just hoping someone could help me out.
8793,Thanks for answering what it meant though appreciate it
8794,Exactly!
8795,There's been plenty of warning and time to get vaccinated before this became an issue.
8796,"Anyone who ignored the advice of medical professionals, and chose to take their chances without the vaccine is getting what they deserve."
8797,"The possible good news is, is that this might be the wake up call that they've needed to get out from the cult they've been apart of for the past 5 years."

8805,Yeah.
8806,Don’t care.
8807,There are no guarantees in life.
8808,Drop your pompous attitude towards this person.
8809,They prefaced that they have been doing their part since February 2020 and got vaccinated.
8810,They are not your enemy.
8811,They are presenting a very logical opinion here that some viroligists agree with.
8812,Many don't see the risk to kids as being substantial enough to restrict our lives.
8813,Did you know only 400 kids have died from Covid in America?
8814,"Not this month, not this year, since the start of the pandemic."
8815,"That's less than the average flu season (and they can get the flu vaccinate, yet Covid without the vaccine is still less deadly to them)."

8826,"Dude, I'm like on my 8th shot now."
8827,How do you know that ?
8828,Was it required to test negative or have vaccine to attend lola ?
8829,"Yes, but they are also the most free."
8830,I got downvoted just for mentioning having a high-risk child too young for the vaccine.
8831,It’s not 1 source.
8832,It’s a comprehensive review of decades of studies on cloth masks and the preponderance of evidence is they work extremely well.
8833,"When they don’t work, it’s usually because they don’t fit well or the user wasn’t wearing it properly."

8835,"Well, [I knew my county would try to reinstate the mask mandate](https://mocoshow.com/blog/montgomery-county-executive-marc-elrich-sets-trigger-points-for-indoor-mask-mandate/) but at least it's only tied to a threshold of 50 cases per day."
8836,So actually following CDC guidance.
8837,Yeah they should furious with themselves for being a danger and nuisance to society.
8838,Go get the vaccine people.
8839,Like you're a performer?
8840,I'd assume you'd be fine without a mask but that you'd need to be vaccinated.
8841,"From a numbers standpoint, one unmasked person who's vaxxed entertaining a room full of people who are masked would seem to be low risk."
8842,Anyone at a performance would be accepting a certain low level risk as part of attending.
8843,Lol wow yeah in the context the headline that’s pretty absurd.
8844,Let's give them their freedom and let them roll the dice so long as they can pay for it and not the people who are doing the right thing.
8845,"While I'm still doubtful that getting COVID is a big problem for most kids, it's clear now that it was a mistake not to be more aggressive about testing/approving vaccines for young children."
8846,"The increased infectiousness has made it much harder to control with only adults vaccinated, and parents who are worried about their kids getting it would have much more peace of mind if they could send them to school vaccinated."
8847,"Right now we're in a very weird limbo where we can't say ""almost everyone who wants a vaccine can get one"" because parents will undersandably raise their hands and say that's not true."
8848,Here!

8861,They aren't completely ineffective.

8872,Etc.
8873,We went from 20-30 cases a day in our entire province to just over 200 today in a matter of a few weeks after restrictions were raised.
8874,June 28th was 24 cases.
8875,I was set to get vaccinated but found out I had to wait because I am getting a mammogram.
8876,The radiologist told me if I get the shot before the mammogram my lymph nodes will swell causing it to be problematic for reading the mammogram correctly.
8877,He said I would have to get it redone in that case or it would result in additional testing to rule out issues on my dime of course.
8878,I’ve elected to wait until the last week in August to get my first shot which will be after my mammogram.
8879,Why are these studies only coming out of Israel?

8881,"For most people, probably."
8882,"I've been on three strong immunosuppressants for 18 years, and my rheumatologist suggested getting a third, testing my antibody levels after 4 weeks, then deciding whether or not to do a 4th."
8883,There's a growing body of literature on how to manage vaccines in the immunocompromised; in most cases our bodies don't create enough antibodies because the drugs we take shut off that process.

8900,CDC seems to always underestimate the ignorance of American people.
8901,"They are ignorant as well, they don't give a fuck about knowing how other nations cope with the pandemic."

8924,It’s not as simple as employers incentivizing good health practices like not smoking because 1 carrier w/o problems can single-handedly create 1+ ICU patients.
8925,I can totally see the insurance companies kicking back on new ICU patients who choose not to be vaxxed.
8926,At some point they’re going to be screaming about having to pay out for these unnecessary costs and they’re gonna jack the rates on all of us.

8945,Meanwhile I haven’t seen a covid positive patient in 2 months or more and my state is 57% vaccinated.

8962,Your likelihood to get hospitalized is higher now due to a more contagious variant of the virus.
8963,Viral load really matters here and Delta has increased the viral loads significantly for people when exposed to it.

9121,Not surprising.
9122,Actors' Equity has had incredibly strict COVID rules ever since live performances starting trickling back.

9124,A vaccinated person has 90% less viral load.
9125,Either way vaccinated people are safe.
9126,"I agree, but Since there’s no national registry of vaccinated people in the US, wouldn’t this basically be impossible to implement?"

9137,"If it was going to be that horrifying, we'd be seeing big increases ready."
9138,I really think it's due to so many people having immunity.
9139,I remember reading early on in the pandemic a few articles basically saying that the population is not homogenous.
9140,Elderly people typically interact with elderly and young people with young people.
9141,There are all these different little groups of people that have more interactions with each other than those outside the group.
9142,Esentially this means that you don't always have to hit those super high immunity thresholds to stop the spread.
9143,"The virus might spread rampant within one group, but then be unable to spread further due to the heterogeneity of population interactions."

9219,The hard core anti vaxxers who believe Bill Gates is putting a microchip in us still won't get it and never will.
9220,The only hope i guess is that the majority of those unvaccinated are not hardcore anti vaxxers but just too lazy to get the shot or just don't think they need it.
9221,I guess for those it'll convince them because hey free money but do they really make up the majority of those unvaccinated?
9222,I disagree.

9255,Except you didn't know it was going on sale - The fact that I was willing to pay $150 for an item and you got the same item the next week for $100 doesn't change my life at all.

9260,Yup because this is never going to end

9262,What we know about the Delta/Darwin variant points toward single dose mRNA shots being pretty low efficacy.

9293,Are we allowed to be pro-vax and anti-mask in your world?
9294,[removed]
9295,You in Moco?
9296,"People wore masks pretty much always until 2-3 weeks ago, when I noticed it lightening a bit."
9297,This week it's back to almost everyone it seems.
9298,The numbers actually are alarming... for the unvaccinated.
9299,That’s correct.
9300,"And vaccinated people can become infected, not get sick and spread the virus, though to a lesser degree than the unvaccinated will."
9301,"That sucks, but ignoring that possibility in areas with high case numbers is not going to make the virus magically disappear."
9302,I'm thinking that if covid is endemic (which is very likely is) they will want to do a booster 1-2 years down the road to ensure that the longer term immune response continue to respond to covid.
9303,"It is possible for them to ""forget"" over long periods of time."
9304,"In the short term though, many people don't need a booster."
9305,For healthy young adults the risk is remarkably low.
9306,It already was before vaccines.
9307,This is so funny unvax ppl dont care if you get the shot?😂
9308,Comes from a government that hasn't needed a balanced budget in years.
9309,It comes from the 1s and 0s on a government computer.
9310,Yea its pretty damn stupid.
9311,"Were at the point now where people who wanted to get vaccinated have, and those who dont arent."
9312,"COVID is here to stay, just like the flu, and its going to be changing every year, just like the flu."
9313,"Its never going to end, people need to accept it, and also stop letting the fear mongering control their lives."
9314,"Its now a part of what we have to deal with if youre a human, so its better to just accept it and live your life just like you always did."
9315,"Were at the stage where we need to just let nature take its course, otherwise this will be a neverending cycle of lockdowns, masks, social distancing, and the countless other things I did the last year and a half."
9316,"Im vaccinated, so no more."
9317,"If there are variants, then so be it."
9318,"Um, to not die?"

9320,Most people do within a reasonable time frame.
9321,"I lost mine for a week, but I was totally back to normal two weeks later."
9322,"The loss of taste was definitely annoying, but I was honestly fine with the loss of smell."

9330,You've never had my MIL's cooking :)
9331,Takeaway- If someone wants it they should have access to it.
9332,If someone doesn’t want it they should not have to take it and should not be barred from society because of that in any form.
9333,Only problem is though not all states have a vaccination passport like other countries so how exactly would one prove they got vaccinated other than your vaccine card
9334,"Kind of disappointed, I was hoping you were going to say yes and post a clip from Maury where security is called to separate all the pregnant strippers fighting."
9335,3 days is on the lowest end of the scale.

9342,haha alright bud.
9343,"Mask, test, trace, quarantine, repeat!"
9344,Is the argument that immune responses triggered by vaccines don’t lessen in time?
9345,Bahahaha!
9346,Even if it didn’t decline (and I guess you’re a superhero?)
9347,it’s less effective because the variants ARE the strains predominant in the USA now.
9348,"Contextually, it makes no difference."
9349,You’re just an idiot who wants to argue.
9350,.

9356,"No, it does make sense."
9357,"Because it's unlikely to happen, I'm not exactly going to be taking precautions like masks."
9358,&gt; but to say there is no chance for it to happen here is naive.
9359,Which I never said.
9360,"In fact, I said

&gt; So yes there's a chance for an American mutation but it ain't likely."
9361,Fabulous!
9362,Really shows the importance of vaccines.
9363,I only hope we can get more eligible Americans to take up the shot asap
9364,"Maybe someone will correct me if I'm wrong, but I believe it would be expressed as 1,700% more likely."
9365,"So if it's not FDA approved... you should definitely get the vaccine so you can stick it to the government?"""
9366,"So maybe Dorothy hallucinated all of Oz because she was dying, and her brain was trying to make sense of the chaos and trauma."

9384,I still think they should raffle off tickets to sporting events.
9385,5 people can sign up in a group of all 5 are fully vaccinated.
9386,If one wins they all get tickets to the same game.
9387,"So it wouldn't be one shot at winning, it would be multiple chances."
9388,Plus vaccinating groups of people.
9389,There's some universities with 100k+ stadiums and 7-8 home games a year.
9390,Some states have multiple teams that could pack their stadiums.
9391,Then there's professional teams.
9392,Then you'd have a year with stadiums full to capacity with 100% vaccinated fans.
9393,Let the full cost of concessions go to the stadiums and teams for them to recoup costs from ticket sales.
9394,So: no change.
9395,"No, 17 \* x"
9396,True.

9442,"They distrust science as decadence, because they know that they, themselves, would never be capable of understanding it."
9443,"And that is why they won’t get vaccinated: because of their self-imposed disadvantage, they have nothing left but spite and hate for everything and everyone they see as lording how much more successful they are over them."

9459,And this idiot is just nuts.
9460,... so what?
9461,They'll vote mega republican?
9462,"Uhm, no, that is not ""what they are asking for""."
9463,All the slide says is that masking is the only non-pharmaceutical intervention they've included in the probability model.
9464,"A few slides later, under ""Next steps for CDC &gt; Prevention"", it first says ""Universal masking for source control and prevention"" and then ""Reconsider other community mitigation strategies"", so it's in no way like other NPIs are off the table."
9465,"My understanding of the way the math is applied may be incorrect, but at R10 and 75% vaccine efficacy, and vaccinated breakthroughs now as potentially as contagious as non-vaccinated infections, the original vaccines alone are no longer enough to get R0 below 1 even in 100% vaccinated communities."
9466,"Herd immunity is no longer possible even theoretically, as it is also mentioned in the slides a growing number of repeat infections occurring six months or more after a previous infection."
9467,"Third dose guidance is probably going to change very soon in response to this, and masks are the stop-gap once again."

9474,Absolutely get tested.
9475,The new guidance is yes.
9476,"i think you are the only one talking about lockdowns...


what kind of business do you run anyway?"
9477,And lots of black people.
9478,For whatever reason they're united with Republicans on this one.
9479,I think many people are at the point where they don’t like life anymore and the whole point in their minds was to be able to do things again.
9480,"I also think many people took the vaccine without a true understanding of how it worked or that new variants could form and change, and now that they understand that they’re just as contagious as non-vaccinated people, and that this time around there kids are in danger from getting sick (see information about children’s hospitals in Houston and Florida), that the vaccine didn’t result in more freedom for them - I don’t think it’s reasonable but many people are wondering why they “risked” taking this vaccine now."
9481,Many people took it thinking it’s new but they’ll be able to “go back to normal” and that they were out of the woods and that the societal punishment of the unvaccinated would be limited to the unvaccinated.
9482,"We’re not a back at square one, we’re at square negative one because now younger people (and kids) are getting hospitalized and kids can’t be vaccinated and there parents have the same viral load as unvaccinated people and the delta variant is just as infectious as chicken pocks and causes more serious disease."
9483,And gets kid sick in higher numbers.
9484,So if you live in an area with a high amount of unvaccinated people you can transmit a variant to someone under twelve even if you’re vaccinated.
9485,How do you think school is going to work.
9486,"I can tell you don’t live in a more poor area, lol."

9492,Anyways...
9493,Those are separate issues.
9494,"Yeah, we need to do everything we can to help get other countries vaccinated, but we also need to make sure that we're adequately vaccinated in the US."
9495,"If every eligible adult in the US were vaccinated, I'm very sure we wouldn't be hearing about the Delta variant in the US."
9496,And what do you propose people do in the meantime to slow the spread between now and mandating the vaccine?
9497,Creating a memorable experience for the rest of your life is a lot easier if you only have two weeks to live.
9498,There are so many leaps in logic here.
9499,I know republicans who are vaccinated and democrats who think it’s poison.

9529,The unvaccinated aren't getting it all done tomorrow.
9530,Handy rule of thumb is that 7 percent growth is doubling every ten days.
9531,I don't think anyone is advocating that the government hold people down and force them to be vaccinated.
9532,The idea is that the government passes increasingly tough restrictions on unvaccinated people to increase vaccination rates until they're high enough to prevent community spread.
9533,"Of course there will always be some hold-outs, but the goal has never been to get 100%."
9534,"For instance, if the government passed laws that anyone needed to either be vaccinated or wear an N95 mask indoors and levied severe fines on businesses for not enforcing those restrictions, many people would choose to just get vaccinated to avoid the hassle."
9535,"If that's not effective, then the government can get more and more aggressive with the laws."

9621,There is a big difference between asymptomatic people walking around with those viral loads and symptomatic people.
9622,"I find it interesting that my state, which has a high vaccination rate and low case incidence, didn't report any such outbreaks considering it has no shortage of shore towns and as robust a public health infrastructure as you'll find in this country."
9623,"Also, ""more transmissible than Ebola"" really doesn't say much."
9624,"Ebola isn't all that transmissible, thank god."
9625,And please forgive me for not putting much faith in transmissibility estimates of the Spanish Flu given those values are all based on inference and modeling.
9626,"Moreover, those are pretty wide error bars around the transmissibility estimate for the Delta variant."
9627,Also of interest to me from the slides: Their estimating the vaccines have between 75 - 85% efficacy at preventing (I'm assuming because its not defined) infection.
9628,Masking is only assumed to be to 40 to 60% efficacious at preventing spread and 20 to 30% efficacious at protecting infection.
9629,To me that's bad news for unvaccinated kids if Delta really is more severe and more transmissible amongst school aged children.
9630,"The British surge seems to suggest this is the case, at least in terms of transmissibility."
9631,To me it makes the slow walk of vaccine approval for the under 12 set somewhat unconscionable.
9632,"At the very least, the contradiction raises questions for me."
9633,"Last, the graphs reporting their modeling have four colors, but only three of the colors are defined."
9634,"Maybe Dr. Iha has more information than appears on the slide or I'm misreading them, but to my I eyes the graphs seem uninterpretable without knowing what the fourth color means."
9635,"Again at the very least, I'm not sure what the Washington Post expects laypeople to get from the slides."
9636,"They don't really show anything new, and their clearly not meant for public consumption."
9637,"I mean, that's fine, as long as they get their shots."
9638,That's a positive.

9956,I work at an urgent care specifically with patients coming in for covid testing.

It's not even close."
9960,Virginia publishes data on their percentage of breakthrough covid cases.
9961,"https://www.vdh.virginia.gov/coronavirus/covid-19-data-insights/covid-19-cases-by-vaccination-status/

Here's that link."
9962,"Over the last 30 days they've had 8,292 unvaccinated covid cases and 213 vaccinated covid cases of that the unvaccinated had 297 Hospitalizations and 13 deaths, vaccinated had 18 Hospitalizations and 1 death."
9963,The vaccine works to prevent severe disease.
9964,That's just last in heart marathons and sugar processing.
9965,This is why I was pissed when they [said in May that they stopped monitoring breakthrough cases.

9967,Especially to her own child.
9968,You don't magically re-acquire all the bright scientists after 4 years of driving them out with political stooges overriding most of their decisions.
9969,And perhaps there was institutional decay even prior to recent years.
9970,Israel is the one saying 80% though.
9971,Also possibly less after 6 months which is why they want a booster.
9972,They are ahead of the world in terms of how long people have had 2 doses.
9973,Holy fuck kidney infections are no joke.
9974,You definitely were feeling symptoms from that in addition to COVID.
9975,Those are some rookie numbers.
9976,We gotta pump those numbers up.
9977,"I don’t believe there has been any definitive consensus about that, yet."
9978,"I think they had initially claimed, or at least predicted, that long-covid would not occur as frequently, or as severely, in fully vaccinated people."
9979,"However, this was also during the short-lived era when they claimed it was highly, highly unlikely that a fully vaccinated person would transmit the virus to another fully vaccinated person."
9980,"In my personal opinion, not enough time has passed for us to have observed how delta infections play out in fully vaccinated people."

9984,Take that money!
9985,But why go above and beyond for people who wouldn't even help themselves or have consideration for others?
9986,?
9987,I've had both covid (at least once but likely twice) and a severe reaction to the vaccine (spiked a 104* fever for one night only) and I'd take the vaccine reaction every day over getting covid.
9988,My covid was fairly mild and I still feel like absolute shit for six full weeks and then some.
9989,On the bright side.
9990,The high transmissibility of Delta variant is probably related to the selective pressure presented by vaccines &amp; natural immunity from prior infection.
9991,"So if kids remain unvaccinated, they may end up uniquely susceptible to a supercharged variant that develops among adults, which could help to alleviate future climate change"
9992,"So Alabama is *not* , then?"
9993,It just says seven people were hospitalized.

9995,Transparency goes a long way as to helping us all understand what's going on.
9996,The media has not done a particularly good job with this over the last 1.5 years.
9997,If we don't have all of the details it's not helpful to report on something like this.
9998,What’s the point if you already have had the virus?
9999,Check my comment history.
10000,I just got out of the ER earlier today.
10001,Had both Pfizer shots and got it from my unvaccinated cousin.
10002,I couldn’t breathe and was given monoclonal antibody infusion after being on oxygen for hours and still dropping
10003,Military members already get non FDA approved vaccinations as a requirement.
10004,"But.. theoretically they will get the antibodies, several times over so that's our herd immunity, right?"
10005,"&gt;First, vaccine requirements for workplaces, colleges, and pretty much anywhere else that's willing to do it: restaurants, theaters, whatever."
10006,This has started already and seems to be ramping up.
10007,To me the data indicates the opposite.
10008,"Now, transmission is happening regardless of vaccinated status, and thus these measures become useless."
10009,"The only course of action, at an individual level, is to get vaccinated to have lower prob of getting severely sick."
10010,"&amp;#x200B;

Even at the end of the article they said it:

&amp;#x200B;

“I think the central issue is that vaccinated people are probably involved to a substantial extent in the transmission of delta,” Jeffrey Shaman, a Columbia University epidemiologist, wrote in an email after reviewing the CDC slides."
10011,"“In some sense, vaccination is now about personal protection — protecting oneself against severe disease."
10012,"Herd immunity is not relevant as we are seeing plenty of evidence of repeat and breakthrough infections.” 

&amp;#x200B;

It is now clearly a personal choice whether to get the vax, but whether you did or not has low effect on other people."
10013,"Israel had Pfizer though, and they are also having many breakthrough infections too."
10014,"Given how virulent this variant is, I think people are simply spreading it much easier."
10015,I heard this as well from a doctor I work with… I don’t know if it’s more fatal tho.
10016,I think it’s spreading more easily so more ppl are getting infected.
10017,Our ICUs are filling up more so too tho so I’m not sure.
10018,[removed]
10019,[removed]
10020,Yes and the US and UK vaccination rates are not that far apart.
10021,I agree it's not an apples to apples comparison but everyone is freaking the fuck out so just trying to put some data out there since everyone is panicking
10022,Very few of the people in Provincetown right now are permanent residents.
10023,Correct me if I'm wrong.
10024,I'd love to be wrong.
10025,'The vaccine was by no means rushed' - Every News outlet gave a time frame of 3 years to have a vaccine at the start of the pandemic.
10026,"Fauci himself said this, that a vaccine wouldn't be ready by now."
10027,'It had more resources thrown at it...etc' - expensive doesn't equal effective.
10028,'Millions of people got it so it could be studied faster. '
10029,"- I don't know how vaccines are studied, so I don't know if this is true."
10030,"I imagine the lab works on antibodies and if there's 50,000 recovered cases vs. 5,000,000 recovered cases I don't know how that changes what happens in the lab."
10031,Does lab capacity change?
10032,"I don't know, and I don't think you do either."
10033,I think you're talking out your ass on this point.
10034,"Correct me, please."
10035,FDA has this approved for emergency use.
10036,"Once the US removes the emergency mandate, the approval goes too."
10037,And the long term effects are what I'm worried about.
10038,"16-18 months of covid data, where the death rate is below a hundredth of a percent, and the numbers are likely even better than that due to asymptomatic cases."
10039,We have 12 months of vaccine data for the 80 year olds.
10040,We have 4 months of data for people under 30.
10041,Maybe less.
10042,"Idk exactly when that age range was approved to take the vac

I'm waiting for 12 to 16 months for the younger range ideallu."
10043,I'm waiting for 6 months after the school year starts at a minimum when all the college students are forced to take it to attend classes.
10044,Just to see.
10045,Is this not fair risk assessment for a young healthy person?
10046,If not tell me why?
10047,"I'm obvious skeptical and biased, but I don't think my points hold no merit."
10048,"And I'm listening, if I'm wrong, show me."
10049,Gotta hold out til around the end of the year.
10050,Hopefully they will kids to be vaccinated by then.
10051,"Even if they do get covid, they’ll most likely be fine."
10052,They’ll become a thing again everywhere if the deaths/hospitals get bad enough.
10053,But it will be a month after they’ve hit capacity at the earliest.
10054,"Yeah boy, wsMFp already owns that moniker"
10055,[removed]
10056,The shot takes 5 minutes to get.
10057,COVID killed my aunt (a healthy 54 year old).
10058,I think three days of side effects (which is unusual) is still better than that.
10059,Ah who cares anyway the rules aren't going away they will all be back soon
10060,Because the 3.7-5.0 number is assuming you are fully vaccinated and other mitigating factors.
10061,I saw them post something like this on WSJ in February.
10062,It’s a lie to quell fear.
10063,"The full R.0 with no factors is likely as you say, 10-12."

10065,Drive plus cruises true.
10066,Joke?
10067,This is not true at all.
10068,But they are 80% to 88% less likely to even be sick in the first place as long as they're hanging out with vaccinated people.
10069,There still the risk at the grocery store or work etc.
10070,"Who cares if they listen lol

That rate of obesity and *still* refusing the vaccine?"
10071,They’re basically begging to die.
10072,ROLL TIDE LOL
10073,"No, unvaccinated are far more likely to spread it."
10074,"Vaccinated individuals can get it and spread it, but they’re 39% less likely to get the virus."
10075,That’s a huge difference.
10076,"And once they get the virus, they’re less likely to have severe infection."
10077,Or die.
10078,The spread is due to unvaccinated people.
10079,"Amazingly enough, when the infection gets out of control, it gets easier and easier to spread to even those with protection."
10080,The US medical industry has definitely brought this on themselves.
10081,"With medical debt being the largest cause of personal bankruptcy, and stories of people receiving six and seven-figure medical bills in the media every day, people are understandably gun-shy about going anywhere near a doctor."
10082,A lifetime of savings can be wiped out by one medical event.
10083,"Not saying this would happen for a covid vaccination, of course, but I think the overall perception of unexpected and unfair bills is well-entrenched in the US population."
10084,"because you know, *god for bid* we would listen to science"
10085,Fuckin plague rats.
10086,Didn't work last election.

10100,Trust me; the people who have chosen to not get vaccinated and who have selfishly refused to wear a mask are far past whatever logic I can try to speak into them.
10101,I’m tired of pissing into the wind.
10102,"I absolutely hate saying this but whenever there was a chance to have either an optimistic or pessimistic take in regards to the pandemic, the pessimistic take seems to be the correct take."
10103,"If I was a betting man, I would bet on the more pessimistic take."
10104,"Again, I do not like saying this and I'm not saying that there are literally zero reasons to be optimistic (because there are)."
10105,"Anecdotally, I have a some friends saying psychedelics helped them recover their sense of smell and taste."
10106,Mushrooms in particular.
10107,Also helped with deeper breathing.
10108,"Might be a long shot but after 8 months, I thought I would suggest it in case you want to explore that option."
10109,That sucks.
10110,Hopefully your sense of taste will get back to normal over time.
10111,"A lot of things smell like eggs to me, which isn't terribly pleasant, especially since it means some bad things and some good things smell very similar."
10112,Have you seen a doctor about your long-term symptoms?
10113,There are supposed to be some things that can be done to try and bring back your old sense of taste.
10114,"Worth a shot, at least."
10115,Tobacco use is a question on every healthcare application I’ve ever filled out.
10116,"You can lie, but I have a feeling doctors can tell pretty much right away and it’ll go in your file."
10117,Def could be wrong tho.
10118,"Smokers def aren’t as covert as they think they are, but the whole vape thing I have no idea"
10119,Disney should mandate guests be vaccinated.
10120,Let DeSantis sue them.
10121,Then this can finally be settled in court.
10122,It'll be a gamble whether we get a sensible judge but it might be a way to nix the anti-vaccine passport law.
10123,"Frick so much of conservative parties can be summed up with the idea of domineering enablers - just do exactly what we want you to do, and you'll be free to do whatever you want."
10124,what a dumb comment.
10125,"the kill-rate in those countries compared to ours is a night and day difference, and their statistical offices of much higher repute."
10126,"you cannot kill a virus, but you can prevent that vast majority of people from getting it and repeating the cycle."
10127,"while strain evolution is inevitable, it absolutely evitable that your population should endure such shock suffering again and again, if you impose preventative measures as soon as alarms go off, like new zealand has done repeatedly."
10128,"what i feel from you is that you like to fetch for new propaganda words for a failed epidemiological strategy which starts by saying ""we can't possibly save everyone so why even try saving the majority""."
10129,"a philosophy that repeatedly questions whether economy comes after health, with disregard to the absolute fact that there is no economy when there is no health."
10130,a mindless repetition of valuing freedom of movement over the even more basic freedom of not fearing the plague every moment you step outside your house.
10131,"it is my generation's economists' abject failure, or greatest act of corruption, to not point the hard evidence that prevention is cheaper, faster and prolonged efficacy than whatever new bullshit half-brained remedy comes around every 2 months."
10132,"in america you are currently turning towards re-masking, and convincing yourselves that face nappies will absolutely stop the cycle."
10133,"whereas in places like spain, our strong mask culture has not been enough, so our idiot rulers are turning back to curfews and other half-assed restrictions."
10134,"meanwhile in new zealand, a situation as dramatic as ours (which are living for the bloody 5th time) was never allowed to escalate this far."
10135,"every time they shut down, they predictably reopened 4-8 weeks later."
10136,"once incidence declined, with certainty and surety people can go back to living without face nappies and bullshit ""new normality"" restrictions on hygiene and distance."
10137,all because they cut the infection cycle and their travel restrictions make it near impossible for untraceable imports of the virus to cause uncontrollable outbreaks.
10138,none of this is of value to you.
10139,you are more concerned with rhetoric.
10140,"winning a battle against someone going against the grain, because s**** you."
10141,there is no interest in actually fixing the problem.
10142,to humbly recognise that there exist already better approaches in other countries to both save lives and keep businesses operational; that our is abject failure in their contrast.
10143,"there will be none of this, because the truth and hard numbers don't matter, change the channel to find your pundit that speaks the nice words and shows the rebuscado pie charts to make you easy that your rulers are valuing your life as highly as you believe they do"
10144,Would 600k+ people have been killed by gunfights?
10145,Exactly!!
10146,When this all went down we were all glued to the tv waiting for our gov to address it and give advise.
10147,"That was a total joke and ended sooo quick.. why is the president not standing in front of all of us— like yesterday, with his corona task force team addressing our country (well my country at least) it’s ridiculous."

10149,Do you personally believe long covid is permanent?
10150,Yes I’m aware but catching COVID after getting already getting it AND being fully vaxxed is crazy.

10169,Mild COVID typically includes lost of smell/taste.
10170,"According to a researcher I heard on NPR recently, that means it's affecting the brain."

10183,"Covid might come with lifelong effects, from even mild infections."

10185,So the CDC gets the right facts but as normal comes to the wrong conclusion.
10186,Saying we will need to learn to live with the virus.
10187,No.
10188,We did try and learn to live with the virus for the past few months and look where it’s gotten us.
10189,We have vaccines now.
10190,We know masks work.
10191,And we know lockdowns work and we know frequent testing works.
10192,Combine those 4 things extremely aggressively and we can look to elongate covid in a short timeframe.
10193,"Thank you, that is very helpful!"
10194,"Vaccine doesn't make you 100% immune, it just massively helps your chances of not being infected."
10195,Delta variant makes that even less so.
10196,"That being said, it MASSIVELY benefits your outcome prediction for severe COVID, hospitalization, or death."
10197,"The more people vaccinated the less chance breakthrough cases do happen, it becomes a math game at that point."

10206,It is great when your pastor reveals himself to be utterly insane since if you comeback the next week you are sure that everyone else is utterly insane.
10207,Trump helped create a culture of denialism about the whole pandemic in general.
10208,"""It's not a big deal!"""
10209,"If you tell people that something isn't a big deal, they aren't going to take any precautions, much less get something like a vaccine."
10210,Sure Trump wasn't anti-vax as far as coronavirus vaccines go but his acolytes have taken this pandemic denialism a step further.
10211,The vaccines have lowered the chance of dying around 20 times.
10212,I think we can safely say Alabama has pulled away from Mississippi for worst state in the US.
10213,My best friend (fully vaccinated with Pfizer) literally just got covid hanging out with 3 other fully vaccinated people for a movie night.
10214,"It turns out one of them had covid, was a symptomatic, another felt sick a couple days later and suggested they all get tested and they all came back positive, the first guy who was asymptomatic caught it from work."
10215,"Delta is seriously changing the game, still good at preventing hospitalization/death, but much more likely to catch it even if you’re fully vaccinated."
10216,Crazy thing is I was supposed to go to that movie night but cancelled at the last minute.
10217,I’ll probably be downvoted but this reads like antivaxx to me.
10218,"It reads a lot like “These people died while wearing seatbelts.” While it’s objectively true that people can still even though they’re wore a seatbelt, what exactly is the solution here?"
10219,That people not wear seatbelts because they’re useless?
10220,That people live in constant fear of transportation because the safety features are not 100%?
10221,"I remember in the article a couple days ago about [long COVID in Israel,](https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/otpask/breakthrough_covid_infections_after_vaccination/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=mweb) it was healthcare workers and like 3% had symptoms after six weeks but only 19% had symptoms at all."
10222,"So, of the healthcare workers who got vaccinated, 0.057% had COVID symptoms after six weeks."
10223,These people are presumably being exposed to COVID *a lot* more than people outside of a healthcare setting.
10224,Vaccines work and 0.057% is hardly a reason to deny that and go back into full lockdown or continue living under a rock out of fear of getting sick.
10225,I was thinking the same thing.
10226,Spread a rumor that if the US achieves 90% vaccination that Trump will be reinstated as President.
10227,Make up some legal sounding nonsense and they'll buy it.
10228,Is the risk of long covid equal though to being unvaccinated?
10229,Same.

10850,Premium are already increasing for unvaccinated people.
10851,When I resigned up for insurance this coming year if you weren't vaccinated then insurance costed 8.08 dollars more per week.
10852,I doubt that insurance can just randomly increase a person premiums since it was already negotiating for the year they're in.
10853,Good idea.

10888,They have offered the vaccine at cost (no profit to them) during the pandemic.

10890,Being one of the few companies to make a vaccine to save so many lives and get the rest of us out of the pandemic is a huge success in itself.

10919,I like to smoke when I drink and can never find someone to bum off when I visit Pittsburgh so they must be doing something right.
10920,I feel we’re getting a bit pedantic but I suppose to return to the initial spark of this conversation which was “raise insurance premiums for the unvaccinated” - it appears the data shows (if you use smoking as a case study) that will not increase vaccination rates but will decrease the amount of people with insurance which costs us all more money in the long term.

10957,"With a bit more than half the population fully vaccinated, we are seeing a fair bit of cases among the vaccinated too."
10958,"One thing to keep in mind though is that this is over 28 days and our second jabs are increasing [very rapidly](https://i.imgur.com/2zMm0uI.png) (orange line), so the proportion with second jabs at the start of the period is very different from what it is now, and doesn't give you a full picture of how much exposure fully vaccinated folks have to unvaccinated/partially vaccinated people."
10959,There are complex systems dynamics at play here and the picture will be clearer when we hit a steady state with a high level of fully vaccinated people.
10960,I can't we're all vaccinated and going to eat outdoors.
10961,NYC specifically Manhattan has a stupid high vaccination rate especially there zip code which has a 90% vax rate.
10962,I think I'll be fine since the CDC hasn't had any guidance on meeting up and stuff yet
10963,Plus there’s the plummeting cases in the UK.
10964,They experienced their spike of Delta before North America.

10983,That is insane!
10984,So much for personal liberty.
10985,How are you feeling after getting your “booster”?
10986,"Others have pointed out related factors (tight quarters in the town itself, MA’s high vax rate making it stand out) but I want to point out some tourism context."
10987,"Cape Cod is a huge tourist region, and actually often votes red (as Barnstable County) despite MA being blue, as people have said in relation to it being in MA."
10988,"Regardless of that, the vax rate has been particularly high down here because of the sheer number of retirement-age year-round population who are looking out for themselves."
10989,"They were vaccinated early, and widely."
10990,Provincetown is disproportionate in its attraction of tourism.
10991,"From LGBTQ+ friendly tourism, to theatre history, to being one of a few places in the county (or state, or the Cape itself) with a weed dispensary, to being a historic place for many families’ arrival to the country, Provincetown is among the most popular Cape Cod locations to visit, in a region already overflowing with tourism."
10992,"And yet, its year round population is much lower than much of the Cape, particularly the ‘upper arm’ of the peninsula, constituting Lower and Mid-Cape."
10993,"All of the Cape sees tourism, but there’s a stronger buffer of vaccinated residents on the more populated parts of the Cape."
10994,Look at Provincetown on a map and see how tiny (and therefore dense) it is.
10995,I would posit that much if this is the strength of the Delta variant and the density of (unvaccinated) tourists in a very small but heavily travelled village.
10996,Well this news about delta from the CDC being as bad as chicken pox transmission wise has destroyed me.
10997,I'm gonna see my grandparents for dinner tomorrow in NYC and I'm taking a subway u always wear a mask but I literally want this all to end in near tears lol
10998,Shouldn't we use this information to get more people vaccinated?
10999,If there is a portion of people who are fearful of people finding out then that portion of people would get vaccinated if we made it easier for them to do it in private.
11000,Maybe making it more available at people's doctor offices or encouraging appointments out of town where people may feel more anonymous.
11001,We don't have to agree with people's fears but we should meet people where they are at to help them do the thing that is right for them and for public health.

11009,i hate wallensky so much for providing inconsistent messaging.
11010,"Yeah, he’s 53 and very much the tough guy type."

11281,"But articles / headlines like this that stew further outrage and hatred between groups in the US (and yes, this hatred between the vaxxed and anti-vaxxed seems to primarily be a US issue), is not helping anything."
11282,It's just causing more toxic behavior and sentiment.
11283,"If the science were behind the article, fine."
11284,But the science is not there to justify such inflammatory rhetoric.
11285,"I will get downvoted for highlighting the data, but now the CDC, in addition to Israel, are now saying that vaccinated people catch and transmit (possibly even close to the same rate that unvaccinated people)."
11286,"But EVEN if the risk were a 50% difference (which it might be, as per the UK study pre-delta), I still don't think that a 50% difference (which could be reduced via masks0, is worth such an inflammatory headline that only aggravates the near religious fervor that exists already on both sides in the US."

11646,"This actually would be how scientific skepticism should work: the outlier -- the Israeli results -- particularly since they didn't initially show their math, should be treated as an outlier, and some effort should be put into showing why all the other results are problematic."

11684,"I can see the initial argument being made that governmental authorities can intervene in private business practices as some precedent may exist consequently of the COVID-19 fiasco , hence why Abbott is taking this stance, but it will quickly be challenged on the grounds that such actions only occurred over the last year as a consequence of a national emergency declaration."
11685,"&gt; For example, here in Canada we mixed and matched our vaccines (I got 1 pfizer and 1 moderna)."
11686,"As we're doing this, the WHO comes out and says don't mix and match."

11724,And it's definitely going to be harder for those living in low vax areas where hospital pressure etc.
11725,is becoming a problem again and I'm very sorry for those of you who are.
11726,"But in higher vax areas, those equivalent to the UK, it can look really bad without actually GETTING bad."

11750,"Well we still need to make the effort to get the unvaccinated vaccinated even if that will be the case, not only do they still put the rest of us and themselves at danger of hospitalization (albeit still much lower for those vaccinated)."
11751,They will overwhelm the healthcare and hospitals (see states with low vaccination rates) and they’re still the root cause for surging cases as vaccinated are still less likely to catch it.

Some of the least-protected areas, like counties in southern Missouri and northern Arkansas, are currently facing large outbreaks."
11821,"In Taney County, Mo., where only 28 percent of residents are fully vaccinated, the average number of daily reported cases is higher than ever, and hospitals in the area are seeing a surge of Covid-19 patients."
11822,"In other areas of the country, vaccination rates are as high as 70 to 80 percent."
11823,But researchers say it is likely that few if any counties have reached herd immunity — or the point at which enough people are immune that the virus is unlikely to spread within the community.
11824,"Because the Delta variant is more contagious, that threshold is higher than before."
11825,That means much of the country is still susceptible to the kind of rapid spread that can put stress on hospitals and lead to worse outcomes for patients.
11826,"The best protection for every community, experts say, is to continue to vaccinate as many people as possible."
11827,"“Small increases in vaccination coverage can make a significant difference in terms of cutting down the number of cases” overall, said Bruce Y. Lee, a professor at the City University of New York who leads the PHICOR research effort."
11828,"“If you get higher in terms of immunity, it can slow down the virus.”

The PHICOR estimates, which combine vaccination rates with estimates of immunity from prior infection, show that more than 98 percent of U.S. residents live in counties where less than 70 percent of the population is immune."
11829,And 82 percent of people live in counties with less than 60 percent immunity.
11830,"To arrive at a risk level for each county, PHICOR researchers adjusted national estimates of Covid underreporting to approximate the true number of cases in each county."
11831,That totals about 128 million cases nationally — nearly four times the number of reported cases.
11832,The researchers combined those case estimates with vaccination rates in each county and adjusted the figures to account for Delta’s ability to evade natural defenses.
11833,"The result is an estimate of the total number of people in each county with immunity to the virus, and an estimate of those who are still susceptible to infection."
11834,Even areas with high vaccination rates might still have pockets of vulnerability.
11835,"And in all counties, children under the age of 12 are not eligible to be vaccinated, making it easy for the disease to continue to spread as children return to school."

PHICOR is one of several research groups attempting to model the trajectory of the pandemic and where the virus might spread next."
11840,"Jeffrey Shaman, an epidemiologist at Columbia University, leads a research group that has produced its own estimates and found fewer vulnerable people than PHICOR overall."
11841,"Dr. Shaman’s model showed broadly similar regional patterns, though measures of vulnerability varied by county because of the different methodology his team used."
11842,"Overall, he agreed that most of the country remains vulnerable to the Delta variant, though he noted that some areas are more at risk of a large outbreak than others."
11843,"“The areas with the higher susceptible pools will grow at a faster rate,” Dr. Shaman said."
11844,"“You’ll see a greater explosion of cases, it will peak at a higher number, and the overall number of people infected will be larger.”

Forecasts compiled by the C.D.C."
11845,on average project that the number of new cases and deaths will continue to rise in the coming weeks now that Delta is the dominant form of the virus in the United States.
11846,"That may mean a return to preventative measures like mask wearing for vaccinated people in some areas, given the uncertainty about breakthrough infections."
11847,"“In communities where we are starting to see real concerning surges in hospitalizations and cases, even vaccinated people need to be doing their part to slow transmission in the community as a whole,” said Lauren Ancel Meyers, an epidemiologist at the University of Texas at Austin and director of the U.T."
11848,Covid-19 Modeling Consortium.
11849,"There are some positive signs: A majority of adults over 65 have been vaccinated in most counties, offering strong protection against the worst outcomes for one of the most at-risk groups."
11850,"And despite the recent rise in cases, the number of new Covid deaths has remained low."
11851,"But the pace of vaccination has slowed by more than 80 percent since its peak in April, and more than half of people in the United States live in counties where most people remain unvaccinated."
11852,"Although breakthrough infections are rare, experts say vaccinated people living around large unvaccinated populations may be more susceptible to these infections because they are more likely to encounter the virus in the event of an outbreak."
11853,"“Every time you go out, there’s a chance that you might encounter someone who is not vaccinated and possibly infected with the virus,” Dr. Meyers said."
11854,"“The more people who are vaccinated, the less likely that becomes.”

The disparate levels of defense across the country pose a further challenge to controlling the pandemic."
11855,"“If you have the virus still locally circulating in certain areas, it raises the probability of another variant emerging,” Dr. Lee said."
11856,Masks were never supposed to be 100% shields against virus.
11857,For that you would need a hazmat suit with corresponding facilities.
11858,"It’s all about probabilities, and getting the average infection rates down."

12124,"The current hospital infrastructure has the ability to add more beds, they struggle to add more staff."
12125,Calling up national guard to build a field hospital removes doctors and nurses from regular facilities and puts then in field hospitals.
12126,"When someone is sick they don't turn up to mobile facilities, they turn up to the same hospital they have always gone to."
12127,Now there is a transportation problem in addition to reduced staffing.

12172,So you mean like a preference or societal tolerance?
12173,I would agree that I think the absolute most we could convince people to get vaccinated is MAYBE once a year if we can do a combined flu shot with higher efficacy.
12174,"But while we’re still figuring things out, I think making a third shot available makes sense if it’s proven safe and effective."

12190,I'm not sure why people are suggesting that.
12191,In a way we are back to square one because we have a more contagious (and apparently harmful?)
12192,virus - but we also have much of the population vaccinated against it.
12193,"This variant is more powerful, but our defenses are stronger too."
12194,"You do the math on the estimated Rt of Delta and the vaccine efficacy, and you come up with an Rt somewhere around 1."
12195,The original Wuhan strain had an estimated Rt of 3-4.
12196,"So obviously 1 is less than 3-4, and the vaccine does help to reduce your chance of severe symptoms including death by ~half."
12197,So instead of a 1% mortality rate we're dealing with ~0.5% mortality rate.
12198,"It's not as bad as it was originally, but it is familiar territory."
12199,"Except yiu and I willl oay their bills, when the hospitals are vailed out w tax dollars."

12203,Small government!

12205,[The Israeli study is an outlier because they used the wrong denominator in the initial run through the data](https://twitter.com/dvir_a/status/1420059124700700677?s=20).
12206,"Basically, they initially used the country-wide vaccination rate in the calculation of effectiveness."
12207,"They went back and then realized that the initial outbreak was very localized, in a population that was highly vaccinated."
12208,"Once they corrected for local vaccination rates, their vaccine effectiveness number is in the ballpark for the England and Canada studies, somewhere in the 80s instead of the 60% range."
12209,"So, with these studies, it's likely Delta shaves off about 10 percentage points from vaccine effectiveness."
12210,"It doesn't cut vaccine effectiveness by 30 percentage points, as was the initial concern with the first run through the Israeli data."

12239,I once worked in a municipality water works lab sampling effluents from water and waste water plants for reporting to the state conservation departments.
12240,Sometimes the waste water plants in smaller cities would malfunction for hours and hours due to power outages from thunderstorms or mechanical issues and hundreds of thousands of gallons - maybe more - of raw waste water would spill into the effluent creeks.
12241,"With the potable water plants, the same malfunctions would happen and cause similar spills into lakes and rivers."

12265,"My point is that, unless the govt sticks to its plan, things are unlikely to change until the bulk of the Australian population has decided it has had enough of the border closures."

12267,What a cock stain
12268,"this is an r0 of 10-12.

original strain was thought to be around 2.5 for reference."
12269,"I understand the back-and-forth nature of these comments, and the inherit tribalism present in this topic; so let me be clear."
12270,We should all get vaccinated.
12271,It's about the most productive action you can take to help yourself and the pandemic.
12272,But we need to be realistic about what this data is suggesting for vaccinated people.
12273,"If you've got a virus that's got an Rt of like 8, and you are vaccinated thereby reducing its effective transmission by 75-85% (somewhere around there, let's even it out to 80% for now) that's 8 - 80% = 1.6."
12274,That's an Rt of 1.6 among vaccinated people.
12275,This means vaccinated people are dealing with a virus that is contagious enough to spread even among just vaccinated people.
12276,Obviously this Rt ~1.6 does not explain the explosive growth we're seeing lately.
12277,That's from the Rt ~8 in the unvaccinated population.
12278,"But we're so mixed together that once we have 200,000 cases a day as has been projected, vaccinated people can perpetuate that outbreak albeit with a slower growth curve."
12279,"What's making people think these vaccines are useless is hearing that they're practically immune and never going to die, and then finding out that entire clusters of their vaccinated friends got it at a party one night."
12280,The CDC needs to be honest about this infectivity and what it means for vaccinated people.
12281,The good news is 1.6 among people living a generally normal lifestyle is easily fixable by some light-handed social distancing (probably).
12282,Indoor mask mandates *might* get it &lt;1 on its own.
12283,But worst case we'll have some reduced capacities and such.
12284,That *ought* to get vaccinated people out of this mess.
12285,Unless another variant with an Rt &gt; 8 comes around..
12286,"&gt; Assuming Delta isn't being overblown regarding symptoms for vaccinated people

I haven't seen anything suggesting symptoms are worse with Delta for vaccinated people."
12287,The CDC changed their stance based on evidence that people who are vaccinated and have symptoms can potentially transmit the virus.
12288,They didn't say those symptoms are more severe.
12289,"Both UK and Canadian studies showed that having mild symptoms is upwards of 80% less likely for a fully vaccinated person, and severe symptoms remain extremely rare."
12290,Spoken like someone without kids.
12291,"Kids are already massively behind in education now, and more so in socialization."
12292,Enough is enough.
12293,Why are you getting kicked out...?
12294,Only because we give them room and a voice.
12295,We take them seriously and pretend their stance isn’t completely wrong and insane.
12296,We need to reject these people not pander to them.
12297,As far as I am concerned at this point - they are throwaways.
12298,Their blatant disregard for their own and others lives disqualifies them from participating in our society.
12299,"I always get downvoted when I post this point of view, but here goes: the elephant in the room that somehow never gets addressed is health insurance."
12300,A large percentage of the unvaccinated are poor people - many of them Black and Hispanic - and many who do not have good health insurance coverage.
12301,"Even though the vaccine is free, an adverse reaction or complication that requires an emergency hospital visit could cause financial ruin to a low income worker even if they have insurance."
12302,"People in underpaid, shitty service jobs with inadequate or non-existent healthcare, who have been expected to risk their lives during the pandemic are less trusting of the system, including the medical system, for good reason."
12303,Because Europe isn't full of Americans.
12304,I know we are giving them as young as 12.
12305,And like I said I did consider not getting my kids vaccinated because I didn’t know enough about any potential side effects of the vaccine.
12306,"But if more and more kids under 12 are getting sick, and badly, it makes me believe the vaccine is a better option than the possible side effects from having the virus itself."
12307,"Obviously if it’s not recommended I won’t get them the vaccine, but my job as their parent is always to do what’s in the best interest of them."
12308,I think a lot of people who don’t want to vax their kids tend to also not have the vaccine themselves and then I question why they don’t want it in the first place.
12309,"If it’s political, than yes, I would have some judgments on that."
12310,You can turn down vaccinations in the military?
12311,When I was in they walked us down an assembly line giving us shots no questions asked lol.
12312,"Or that eldercare workers didn't need to test, or elderly in homes no need to test, or wait maybe there was no need to test because they had sent out millions of useless tests....maybe that was it."
12313,I never stopped masking which I started last February.
12314,You don't need an incompetent organization telling you what is best.
12315,Read the studies and act accordingly.
12316,"There was a time where it was touted as 90% effective against even catching it, and words like ""virtually impossible"" were used when it came to hospitalization and death."
12317,Those words mattered.
12318,And many places were trending down when the vaccine roll out started.
12319,In May and June and  it was unclear so SO many people would choose not to get vaccinated and we had not heard of Delta being a threat in much of the world.
12320,"I think it depends on where you live, but in many places there was like a month where everyone was told you were safe if vaccinated."
12321,So what.
12322,Its goddamn summer and people are getting vaccinated left and right.
12323,You really do expect people to stay locked down home forever?
12324,"If they are vaccinated, its quite possible that the whole shitshow will end just with this."
12325,A positive PCR test.
12326,Thats what the vaccines are for.
12327,To protect you from serious illness or death.
12328,Didn't they used to test vaccines on soliders?
12329,They’re not colonies.
12330,They have full access to the vaccine.
12331,[removed]
12332,you don't even need to be working outside of the home it's anybody.
12333,"I either pick mine up from work or the chemist, but you can get them from some testing sites or order them on line."
12334,But you need to book a pcr and isolate until results are through if you have symptoms.
12335,"This week when my daughter needed a pcr I booked a test at 2, she was tested at 3 and result at 7 the next morning."
12336,Now on the 10 day isolation.
12337,Wow.
12338,"And two months into the pandemic, hooooo boy."
12339,Guess we will need better equity measures for the white affluent people in the city.
12340,We can’t shame them.
12341,We need outreach.
12342,We need to learn how to communicate and educate this group.
12343,This.
12344,I have epilepsy and another chronic health condition.
12345,I wanted to wait to make sure the vaccine was safer for those with my conditions.

Hm idk, my country doesn't recommend vaccinating healthy children under 18."
12389,So you have to go against the recommendation to get it and I understand why people would be hesitant.
12390,I've been worried about this ever since I found out that they're not tracking break-through cases - only hospitalizations and deaths.
12391,"As a researcher, I cannot fathom why they wouldn't want data on break-through cases that don't lead to hospitalizations."
12392,The only thing I can think of is that they want to give people a sense of security.

12543,I misspoke.
12544,So I have a question?
12545,Per Fauci a tenant of virology is as a virus continues to spread it continues to mutate.
12546,We now know that the virus is transmitted among by everyone regardless of vaccination status.
12547,The only potential difference between vaccinated and unvaccinated is severity of disease.
12548,So regardless of vaccination status if people keep milking about through society vaccinated or not they will continue to spread the virus.
12549,"More people milling about more transmissions, no masking increased transmission."
12550,"Increased transmission leads to increased rate of mutations which leads to the development of a more virulent, deadly variant that evades all vaccine protection."
12551,"So imho it’s not a question of vaccinated or not, because that ship has sailed."
12552,The question is surgical vs n95 mask and regional vs total lockdown.

12663,"I'm going to assume this comment is a byproduct of your own fear of the vaccine, so allow me to point out that there has never been any vaccine that has had side effects after 60 days of being administered."
12664,In fact if you are going to have side effects you will normally observe them within the first 30 days.
12665,That goes for all vaccines including the ones we use now.
12666,"So don't worry, if someone is fine 30 days after getting the shot, then there is only a very small chance that something will happen after that point, and past 60 days they are in the clear."

12778,"I got vaccinated as soon as I was eligible, and I have many friends who did the same."

12781,"Reports said Christian Medical College in Vellore wants to pursue this study and it will soon take place on 300 healthy volunteers."""
12782,Agreed.
12783,I got tested frequently just to be able to visit my mom at her LTCF this past winter.
12784,"As much as I liked seeing all of the safeguards being employed (testing everyone routinely)… when they moved to “ONLY unvaccinated staff must test weekly,” I was surprised &amp; pleased."
12785,"It wasn’t the vaccinated staff showing up &amp; infecting residents, entirely the opposite, of course."
12786,The outbreaks were 100% perpetuated amongst unvaccinated staff.
12787,I’m proud that our LTCF has greatly increased their vaccinated #’s.
12788,It took some time &amp; persistence &amp; I think this updated testing policy also helped.
12789,"My kid got a vaccine breakthrough infection in around 2013 (very mild), and someone on Facebook asked if she could bring her kid over for a play date hoping the kid would get infected."

12792,"Also, last year Auburn and U of Alabama only graduated something like ten math/science teachers as most STEM minded people choose a more lucrative career."
12793,To combat this Alabama actually passed a program where math/science teachers can be paid significantly more than other teachers.

12834,"This is probably a good policy, but regardless of how you feel, Disney should offer refunds on any park tickets purchased between lifting the mask policy and announcing the new mask policy."
12835,It's only fair for people who bought tickets thinking they'd be able to enjoy a mask-free Disney visit to get refunded if they like.
12836,"Plus, fewer people in the parks is a good thing to reduce spread."
12837,A small number of tests get sent to a different lab for another kind of analysis.
12838,I don't think anyone gets to find out for sure what variant they have.

12848,"For some, and for some spending a week in an ICU and barely surging will shut them up"
12849,They also used a 3 week interval unlike every country with good efficacy findings.
12850,And they also vaxxed first so they'd be first to be hit with waning immunity.
12851,I'm not saying they didn't also bungle their numbers bc I don't feel qualified enough to determine who's right.
12852,But I'm also not latching onto any explanation that gives me the result I want.
12853,"If you look at the counties in Michigan that had a severe outbreak of the UK variant in their low-vaccination populations last Spring, it suggests that the answer to your first question is ""yes."""
12854,"Their case counts are pegged to the floor right now, despite most cases being found in Michigan being the delta variant."
12855,"The CDC's current guidance is based on local case counts, so anything that lowers cases should affect their guidance, assuming they keep this policy."
12856,[removed]
12857,I'm not advising entire populations.
12858,"So yeah, I can be a prick and if you don't like my opinion well I frankly don't care"
12859,In Alabama we have signs for hiring for the bus all over our county.
12860,"So it's NOT 20% of the population,  but  20% of submitted test ... Jesus this is such a bullshit article."
12861,"20 out of 100 tests are positive, to me that seems fucking  low,  not  scary high."
12862,&gt;Does anyone know if I ended up in the ER because my cousin was unvaccinated and there might’ve been a higher viral load?
12863,"Not a doctor, just someone that's been following epidemiologists, virologists, and medical PHD's on the subject, very closely, from the beginning."
12864,unvaccinated people and symptomatic vaccinated individuals with 'breakthrough' infections almost certainly carry a higher viral load.
12865,The big issue with Delta is it reproduces 1000x inside the body faster.
12866,"If you were vaccinated more than a couple months ago, that could also explain why you got so sick."
12867,"Over time, your antibody levels naturally decline, but your t- and b-memory cells still ""remember"" what covid looks like - they just take time to ramp up antibody production."
12868,"All of these factors - what antibodies someone produces, how much, and how quickly are all variable based on your individual immune system - which is why it's so hard to pin down exactly who is getting sick despite being vaccinated."
12869,"If it's any consolation, unless you are immune compromised you will probably have an incredibly high level of protection against future infection at this point."
12870,"Get some rest (melatonin is helpful for sleep and also has been shown to help modulate the inflammatory phase of covid), hydrate, don't forget your Vitamin D (helps modulate immune system and has also shown to be helpful in Covid infections) and get well soon!"

12877,They also don't have special judges who operate at the Europol level to make international criminals go to jail efficiently.
12878,So far data says yes

12910,Well they're often brainwashed.
12911,There is a propaganda campaign against masks playing out in the media where people downplay the virus and do things like tell people to call child protective services if they see a child with a mask on.
12912,They are pointing out that Republicans like Greg Abbot literally were screeching that it was government over reach to tell companies they have to use masks.. but now they are essentially doing exactly the same thing but the inverse.
12913,My point is vaccinated or not at present the only way we are going to end/curb the pandemic is masks and social distancing.

12946,I understand the concern but if the efficacy of the vaccines continues to wane and people start getting very sick from an existing variant I don’t think we have the luxury of accounting for what if’s.
12947,Getting as many people as we can vaccinated against what is out there now has to be the priority.
12948,That way transmission is lower and it’s harder for new variants to form and spread.

12969,"I live in this area and was hoping that our county would require masks through the summer, when tourism would die down after Labor Day."
12970,I think in all tourist areas it’s pretty important to keep the indoor mask mandates in place during whatever their respective tourist seasons.
12971,Disney should probably require it indoors and out until this thing is under control world wide.
12972,&gt;90 percent or more against hospitalization with delta.
12973,With most of that remaining 10% being the elderly or immunocompromised whose immune systems never mounted a full response to the vaccine.
12974,Please re-read what is being said.
12975,Vaccinated individuals’ ability to pass the disease between each other is astronomically more likely.
12976,"We have to undo our thinking that “if I am with other vaccinated people I am safe.”  
Regrettably, if your aim is to fully avoid getting COVID-19 now that Delta is rampant and gaining steam by the second, you will need to go back to March level precautions - except this time with masks!"
12977,Stay safe friend!
12978,Facebook also has the most dramatic people...
12979,Coincidence...I think not

12996,Actually I think it would be a great improvement for Facebook content.
12997,Right now Facebook is a collection of lots of tiny subreddit of people who are highly likely to agree with each other.
12998,"They also don't have any labels, so they don't know how their group is characterized."

13027,What you are talking about is efficacy against severe disease.
13028,I don’t disagree that the vaccinated people fared better once infected.
13029,However these numbers show that it didn’t provide much protection at all against infection.
13030,"Agreed, masks put a barrier between people"
13031,Why?
13032,I thought Republicans preferred for everyone to govern themselves.

13105,"Abbott really cares about the health and safety of Texas students, educators and their communities, he will give local school officials and health experts the option of requiring masks in their schools,"" Ovidia Molina, president of the teachers union, said in a statement."""
13106,Interesting how Gov.
13107,Abbott claims to be on the side of personal freedom but restricts personal freedom at public schools.
13108,Kinda confusing to be honest.
13109,[removed]
13110,Because they don’t want covid period?
13111,Why does it have to be anything more than that?
13112,"As always, fuck Gov Abbott."
13113,Man those are great articles…do you work in a hospital?
13114,"If so, then you would see that 80% of the people in ICU right now are people who have been vaccinated and have COVID-19 (not in any of these articles)."
13115,"You would see the man on the vent right now who thought getting the vaccine would prevent this…you would see his family trying everything they have to keep their dad alive and the confusion they have because they read these articles, and now their dad is on life support."
13116,This is only one story of the many families around me.
13117,What do I tell them?
13118,When I first read your comment I thought you were kidding….then I read the comments and realized you are actually serious!!
13119,What do I tell the people around me who are dying?
13120,Do you have an article for them?
13121,[removed]
13122,i want to see what happens when a family that has dead members sues abbot for his involvement in there death.
13123,"I have a feeling it’s because of the new guidance, and Manhattan is currently above the CDC’s threshold."
13124,"Seeing as they have to negotiate safety protocol with ~15 unions between actors, musicians, crew, wardrobe, ushers, etc, it was probably easiest to be overly cautious."
13125,"Those guidelines are also being re-assessed for performances beginning November 1st, so the mask mandate may only apply for the first two months."
13126,Yes that is exactly what happened.
13127,But in that scenario it means the risk for an unvaccinated person was exactly the same as a vaccinated person.
13128,It literally means the virus was proportionally split among the population.
13129,Vaccinated people didn’t fare any better than unvaccinated in that scenario.
13130,Remember when these people thought covid was made up worldwide to make trump look bad?
13131,Pepperidge Farm remembers
13132,They did fight TWO WARS with TWO different Countries so they could keep slavery.
13133,So I’m not surprised by this one bit

13137,How do we stop people from high unvaccinated countries from spreading the virus?
13138,We need to cut them off completely.
13139,"Brutal yes, but we have to help ourselves before we help others."
13140,You're not going to be able to end the pandemic in 6 months unless you have Wuhan style military lock down across the entire globe.
13141,"Even then, you're not guaranteed to have success."
13142,China is still seeing non-zero covid cases per day even though all travelers are required to be tested as well as quarantine for 14 days.
13143,That's just not feasible in the world we live in.
13144,Do you halt global trade for however long it takes to eradicate the pandemic globally?
13145,Only stopping international travel will still allow domestic spread.
13146,"Unless the disease is so virulant that it kills its host very quickly like MERS, the spread will not be able to be contained."
13147,Merely holding the powder keg is not a long term solution.
13148,Italian city of Ferrara was able to keep the Bubonic plague at bay by patrolling its borders as well as sending sending all suspected infected persons to a hospital located outside the city.
13149,"Unless you're okay with sending all suspected covid patients to Guantanamo, you're not going to be able to keep prevent the disease from spreading indefinitely."
13150,Hope it’s not too late.
13151,Great so glad I moved back to this shit state of Texas.
13152,I hate this place.
13153,Because it's literally limiting government power.
13154,Because even a curosory examination of any of the hundreds of sources available on this sub (and others) shows that getting the vaccine is extremely effective against the delta variant as well.
13155,"The most common reason to say ""I regret getting the (super effective) vax"" is some sort of anti-vaxx astorturfing bullshit."

13159,"This is outrageous and I hope Abbott’s grandchildren die slow, horrible deaths."
13160,Let them die.
13161,The delta variant has already burned through UK without overwhelming deaths or hospitalizations.
13162,Cases there are dropping sharply now and the US isn’t too far behind where the UK recently peaked.
13163,We should expect to see same results.
13164,What vaccine did you get?
13165,"My husband and I are both fully vaccinated (Pfizer for me, Moderna for him)."
13166,"My coworker has had COVID not once, not twice, but THREE TIMES."
13167,We were exposed to her last weekend at a memorial event for my dad.
13168,"We got tested this week and we are fine, thankfully."
13169,I really wish my coworker would get the damn shot.
13170,"Well, it does mean that you were wrong that it is impossible."
13171,"But I generally agree, people in this thread do not have the necessary epidemiological qualifications to fully interpret the implications behind this data, and understand and internalize confounding variables."
13172,"From what I have been able to ascertain from qualified experts this data is concerning, but nothing to be hysterical about."
13173,"The data shows vaccines are still doing a very good job of preventing severe illness and hospitalization, but it will likely cause us to re-evaluate how the vaccine impacts transmission and NPIs that may be necessary for vaxx'd people to further reduce likelihood they contract COVID or become vectors to spread it."
13174,What really?
13175,This is a genuine question.
13176,That’s such a great idea!
13177,"Segregation has never gone wrong in the past, surely this won’t be harmful!"
13178,Maybe you should open a history textbook and understand the dangerous words that are coming out of your mouth.
13179,"Ask the people who have been slaughtered like the Jews, polish, Kulacks, and countless others."

13210,I still haven't had anyone explain to me in a satisfactory way why I should even care about catching COVID as a vaccinated individual.
13211,"I'll be fine, it's basically a common cold at that point."
13212,"""It might mutate again"" is not an acceptable justification for: mask mandates, social distancing mandates, capacity restrictions, or any other undue restrictions on the rights of Americans."
13213,"I wasn't trying to be optimistic, just showing that even in the more moderate range of the estimate, we can't stop this from spreading."
13214,"People's only options are to be exposed after vaccination when they're far less likely to get severely ill, or to be exposed with a naive immune system and risk hospitalization and death."
13215,I'm sorry if this is in poor taste but can we just like get the rational people out and then build a wall around Texas or something?
13216,"Am I the only one who thinks that when the long term lockdown ends and borders open, that Covid (despite a large portion of the population) is going to have a field day in Australia and NZ?"
13217,So few people have been exposed to it this entire time that there’s very little natural immunity.
13218,How do you explain the poor vaccination rates among urban black and Latino communities?
13219,How do we know that any other strain would have spread differently when we always had restrictions in place?
13220,The original strain may have spread just as quickly had we not placed restrictions in march 2020.
13221,Matter of fact if you look at the new york numbers as well as a few other US hotspots you could see how high the death count went but we had hardly any testing to determine how many infections there were.
13222,Comparing delta to any other strain is unfair as human behavior has changed drastically over the past few months.

13230,And no lockdowns this round and DeSantis is pushing against masks.
13231,Oh crap.
13232,I'm saying its pretty clear the CDC is making recommendations off of the politics of we need things to be reopened as fast as possible instead of the scientific method.
13233,See their fuck up of telling people masks weren't need anymore while the everyone could see what Delta was doing to India.
13234,CDC still not even fully recommending everyone mask up again yet.
13235,The science that says the vaccine protects well against even the delta variant?
13236,Norway will also get an additional of 300-400k due to little vaccine uptake in Eastern Europe.
13237,It seems like the doses are divided among countries with high uptake.

13435,I had several projects that had planned out drive up pharmacy canopies nixed in favor of using that same space for multiple pull through grocery pickup.
13436,"Initially it resulted in an uptick in employment because you needed to hire another group of runners for grocery pickup services, but then they started converting checkout lanes into more self checkout, which meant they needed less cashiers

13437,"Grocery service only accounts for about 20% the footprint of a building, but is closer to 80% the gross revenue of the store."
13438,I am not saying Walmart started grocery pickup out of altruism.

&gt;Early evidence in health care providers that vaccination may
reduce transmission and attenuate illness
and

&gt;Compared to unvaccinated cases, vaccinated cases (full or partial) had:
– 40% lower mean RNA viral load (2.3 v. 3.8 copies/mL)
– shorter mean duration of detectable viral RNA (2.7 v. 8.9 days)
– lower risk of febrile symptoms (25.0% v. 63.1%)
– shorter mean duration of symptoms (10.3 v. 16.7 days)


Why are you lying so blatantly but giving me a link?"
13467,That’s the part I’m hoping for.. but my county wants to be all smart and actually get the vaccine.
13468,Has the vaccine actually killed anybody?
13469,"Blood clots or anaphylaxis are severe, but they know what to look for and can treat you."
13470,No that wasn’t “lying”.
13471,"That was the science at the time, prior to delta variant."
13472,Several studies showed the vaccines had &gt;90% effectiveness in preventing asymptomatic infection.
13473,No asymptomatic infection = no transmission.
13474,Even for those who few who did have asymptomatic infection the viral load was low so transmission unlikely.
13475,Nothing was 100% but pretty close to that for vaccinated not transmitting.
13476,That’s why masks came off.

13494,Estimate cloth masks to reduce transmission by 60% and provide around 30% protection against catching the disease.
13495,N95s are much more protective.
13496,The question is how much individual risk you are willing to take.
13497,"As a fully vaccinated, healthy 30 something who lives with another fully vaccinated, healthy 30 something, I am happy to just wear a cloth mask into stores and otherwise live as normal."
13498,I find N95s to be uncomfortable and also difficult to get properly fitted.
13499,"If I lived with kids or immunocompromised people, the calculation would be different and maybe I would wear higher quality masks."
13500,"So in short, I think mask quality is an individual choice, with no obvious right/wrong answer for vaccinated people."

13520,The biggest problem people here have with mask mandates that I have noticed?
13521,Not the mandate itself but what comes with it.
13522,The CDC is not calling for social distancing or dressings rooms to be closed or concerts to be canceled in their latest study.
13523,"They only call for more masking, but you can bet that most places that have a mask mandate tend to follow with voluntary restrictions on private businesses and maybe even capacity limits etc."

10% spread the virus to one other person, and 3% infected two or three others."
13597,"80% had no spread, 7% were undetermined."
13598,Correct me if I am wrong but thats a pretty damn small Rt number among vaccinated people.
13599,Based on Abbott's actions he is quite literally trying to kill off as many Texans as he can.

13605,That's exactly what that means
13606,Illinois did this.
13607,No official state mandate; however there is a mandate for federal buildings now.
13608,But a lot of the counties now affected by the new CDC scale immediately has stated they recommend them for indoor.
13609,"Though, none require them so there’s still about half the people in the stores not wearing them from my observations."
13610,"I’m honestly shocked and proud that NY didn’t automatically implement it, and are actually reviewing the data/guidance unlike many states and counties."

13616,We have an 80% staff vaccination rate.

13627,What’s the endgame here
13628,I still remember a story a priest told during his sermon when I was a kid.
13629,There’s a shipwreck and a few guys are bobbing around in the ocean on a life raft.
13630,"Helicopter comes to rescue them, but there’s not enough room for all of them, so a few stay behind, saying no problem, my God will save me."
13631,"Helicopter comes back, but there’s not enough room for one guy, so he stays in the raft saying, don’t worry my God will save me."
13632,Helicopter takes the rest to land and comes back a third time.
13633,Guy in the raft tells the helicopter to go back and that his God would save him.
13634,"Of course, the guy drowns and is taken to the pearly gates."
13635,"When he gets there, he asks God why he didn’t save him from the storm."
13636,God looked at him and said “well I sent the helicopter three times!”
13637,Covid misinformation on Facebook is killing people
13638,"It's probably not a ""code black"" but that they've hit black in their surge capacity plan, which is worst case scenario."
13639,&gt;The exact same things you describe for the EU is valid for the USA.
13640,"No, internal differences in the EU are far wider in respect to current data and underlying trends."
13641,"I'm gonna quote myself:

&gt;Mississippi and Massachusetts may have vastly different vaccine uptakes, but the reasons that explain different underlying trends (e.g., different uptakes according to party affiliation, or ethnicity, or income etc.)"
13642,still apply to both state and can give insights to drive policy.
13643,The same does not apply to Denmark and Bulgaria - they're just completely different worlds.
13644,"Also, the EU is **not** a federation."
13645,"It's a loose supranational entity that is tentatively applying common policies in certain areas but it's extremely far from being a federation - no federal law system, tax policy, job system, language, border policy, healthcare system etc."
13646,[removed]
13647,"I agree with you that it’s a factor, and judging from the behavior of everyone I know, vaccinated people aren’t considering it at all in their assessment of risk."
13648,They’re evidently not aware of it.
13649,This feels like a major gap in public health messaging.
13650,&gt;Breakthrough cases are rare enough they should not be concerned.
13651,Lol now you are just moving the goalposts.

13660,We have patients in these small exam rooms with us coughing all over the place.
13661,Right?
13662,That’s basically just Florida
13663,"Only genetic sequencing does that, which is done on a small number of positives for surveillance purposes."
13664,"There is no clinical reason to determine that ( and you will likely be recovered before the result is known) Assume it’s delta now, more than 90% of cases in US are."
13665,They already have education though!
13666,It's Alabama.
13667,Not surprising.
13668,"It was one of the dumbest decisions by the CDC ever to get rid of the mask mandate, when the vaccination rate was still v low."
13669,We're having higher vaccination rates in certain countries in Europe and we're far from getting rid of masks indoors.
13670,That's a scary article.
13671,"My doctor still isn't vaxxed (I am, I didn't even ask my drs opinion, tbh)."
13672,"But talked to him a couple of days ago (still doing telehealth) and he's freaking out over a young person that died, and now considering the vaccine."
13673,I don't know how these people rationalized not vaxxing.
13674,"Every single one seems to think it was never going to get ""them."""
13675,"Until it does, or it gets someone close to them."

13999,"From the discussion paragraph:

&gt; The findings in this report are subject to at least four limitations."
14000,"First, data from this report are insufficient to draw conclusions about the effectiveness of COVID-19 vaccines against SARS-CoV-2, including the Delta variant, during this outbreak."
14001,"As population-level vaccination coverage increases, vaccinated persons are likely to represent a larger proportion of COVID-19 cases."
14002,"Second, asymptomatic breakthrough infections might be underrepresented because of detection bias."
14003,"Third, demographics of cases likely reflect those of attendees at the public gatherings, as events were marketed to adult male participants; further study is underway to identify other population characteristics among cases, such as additional demographic characteristics and underlying health conditions including immunocompromising conditions."
14004,"*** MA DPH, CDC, and affected jurisdictions are collaborating in this response; MA DPH is conducting additional case investigations, obtaining samples for genomic sequencing, and linking case information with laboratory data and vaccination history."
14005,"Finally, Ct values obtained with SARS-CoV-2 qualitative RT-PCR diagnostic tests might provide a crude correlation to the amount of virus present in a sample and can also be affected by factors other than viral load.††† Although the assay used in this investigation was not validated to provide quantitative results, there was no significant difference between the Ct values of samples collected from breakthrough cases and the other cases."
14006,This might mean that the viral load of vaccinated and unvaccinated persons infected with SARS-CoV-2 is also similar.
14007,"However, microbiological studies are required to confirm these findings."
14008,Those are some important limitations to this study.
14009,We already knew that delta has more breakthrough cases than alpha.
14010,What this was supposed to bring to the table was the infectiousness of fully vaccinated persons.
14011,To me this is not conclusive evidence on the level of risk due to the possible bias to symptomatic infections and the problems with the analysis of viral load.
14012,"Like they say, this might mean the levels are similar but it's not been proven."
14013,The mask mandate isn't a big problem to me as there is reason to err on the side of caution.
14014,Thinking that vaccinations don't work against delta when it comes to symptomatic illness and that you'd need more dire restrictions to stop the spread even if vaccinations rates are high is much more problematic though.

14118,You and me both (and maybe a few billion other people).
14119,I had been taking it personally when people didn't mask up or socially distance up until a month ago when my immune-compromised mom died (leukemia).
14120,I felt like the selfishness of not wanting to wear a mask or get a vaccine was dooming my mom to solitude.
14121,"Fortunately, a week before she died was when hospital visitation was allowed (1 person in the room with her at a time) and her Shiva service at my childhood home was the first time the rabbi went into a grieving family's home since before the pandemic."

14127,That's actually not unreasonable.
14128,"Obviously the New England area skews more liberal, and has higher vaccination rates to begin with."
14129,"In addition, other comments in this thread point out that these particular mass-gatherings were popular with gay people, another highly liberal demographic that's more likely to get vaccinated."
14130,"Finally, the very fact that these people were going to mass gatherings in the first place means they felt safe doing so, which is an indicator that they were mostly vaccinated."
14131,"So we don't know for sure, but it is not at all unreasonable to hypothesize that 75% or more of the attendees were vaccinated."
14132,Every teacher should strike then.
14133,Covid tore through the UK pretty good last year.
14134,"My guess would be that a combination of vaccination+a higher than expected number of those with acquired immunity combine to limit just how widely the virus can spread and results in a steep, rapid drop off once it starts dead-ending regularly."
14135,"If i'm right then we should see another surge in the winter, but a smaller one than this time and so on and so on, each surge being smaller and smaller until daily case counts never go into five figures."
14136,Only time will tell.
14137,That's unfortunate and a classic example of cognitive dissonance and the poor way people justify things to ease their mental stress.
14138,I live near you and just registered my daughter for schooling.
14139,They required proof of current vaccinations.
14140,So does this mean I don't need that any more?
14141,These people act like vaccination proof is new.
14142,It's not and this whole this is stupid.

14158,That is a vaccine effectiveness rate of preventing death by 99.77%.
14159,"As time goes on, the number will normalize closer to the vaccine's actual rate of effectiveness against death from all variants, but I suspect we will be hearing the line ""99% of people dying from COVID are unvaccinated"" for a long time."

14190,"Please do not think all of us here are that stupid, I beseech you!"
14191,Some of us are here for work purposes and entirely against our wishes.
14192,"Yesterday I went to the supermarket and people were wearing masks, granted, I live in a county where most people are pretty educated and live in healthy conditions."
14193,"But let this be a lesson on how stupidity can kill, literally!"
14194,Except for the incredibly important fact that California has a MUCH larger population.
14195,When you adjust for population Texas is much worse.
14196,"Ok, this is the second time I’ve seen that figure."
14197,Can you please share where you are pulling it from?
14198,I simply cannot manage to confirm chickenpox having an R0 of 10-12.

14210,Exactly.
14211,I truly don’t know where that came from
14212,"No, stuff like hooking up your brain up to a computer brain to do mind transfer to be able to get out of an old dying body into a healthy computer brain / body."
14213,-Computer brain / whatever kind of brain = 'neural network that learns off of self' -thats basically what a brain is.
14214,"So, dying of old age - dying of a disease -- this can be avoided..

Perhaps ie something like 'neuralink' can link the brain up to a computer brain."
14215,You might want to try the legislature building instead.
14216,Too bad your in an area with a mask mandate.
14217,I'm in Virginia and thankfully our governor didn't mandate anything this go round.
14218,Did they ask you for insurance?
14219,Did you give it?
14220,Possibly in some locales but I doubt actual lockdowns will be widespread.
14221,Half of the states haven’t been in lockdown for at least a year at this point.
14222,Jesus.
14223,I'm vaxxed but terrified of getting infected.
14224,Is this a situation where we are just all going to get infected at some point?
14225,My anxiety is through the roof.
14226,I'm not even sure there are 460000 possible things that can go wrong in a human
14227,agreed.
14228,schools can't afford it though.
14229,and rapid tests are still pretty awful
14230,Could be this - https://context-cdn.washingtonpost.com/notes/prod/default/documents/8a726408-07bd-46bd-a945-3af0ae2f3c37/note/57c98604-3b54-44f0-8b44-b148d8f75165.
14231,"&gt; that will not increase vaccination rates

Being unvaccinated isn't addicting, though."
14232,Seems like an overreach to assume that the stats on smoking would carry over to vaccinations.
14233,"If we could find ""Entry into cessation programs/attempts"" stats."
14234,That would be a more relevant one.
14235,"If we saw rate increases due to smoking lead to more tries (which nearly all resulted in failure), that would lead us to believe that it would bump up vaccinations."
14236,"Lot easier to get vaccinated than it is to quit smoking, ya know?"
14237,Ok then you fall into a different group from some others.
14238,"That's why I said ""some""."
14239,Oh I know.
14240,I’m pretty much agreeing with you.
14241,I just think the schism between flu-thinking and covid-thinking is a really strange bit of sociology.
14242,"Kids can’t get the vaccine, hence why school is going to be such an issue"
14243,But is that immunity cross reactive to the new variants?
14244,"I mentioned this the other day on here, but I personally know someone who has caught it twice, about 5 months apart."
14245,"This person is not at all immunocompromised, does not take any medications, and is in his 20s."
14246,Mild cases both times.
14247,"The explanation he was given is that he caught an ""ancestor variant"" the first time, and ""delta variant"" this time."
14248,"I know anecdotes should be taken with a grain of salt, but in my eyes since I personally know this person it hits a lot closer to home."
14249,What does the data actually show about cross reactive immunity between variants?
14250,We don’t feel comfortable leaving him alone for that long – we even have a friend staying overnight this weekend to ensure if anything happens that someone is there to help.
14251,"We have a two-bedroom apartment, so I guess I will mask up for a week and sleep in a different room."
14252,Just fine!
14253,I had about 6 hours of feeling a bit under the weather with a low-grade (100 F) fever.
14254,"My husband only felt a bit tired, no fever."
14255,My side-effects were about identical to my parents' reactions to getting their second Pfizer shots.
14256,The problem is the dangerous concentrations of selfish morons vote pro-selfish moron and live in selfish moron states.
14257,Without the federal government suddenly growing huge amounts of control it would never be able to enforce the stick on the people that need it.
14258,Sure the selfsh moron governors will say they think everyone should get the jab but they know enforcing it will them kicked to the selfish moron curb.
14259,"At what point will the Americans’ system of

14260,That's a huge ass number at 100 million people.

14306,It doesn't make sense to me.
14307,Just because someone is good/great/goat/whatever at their job doesn't mean that will translate to every other job.
14308,Or even a single other job.
14309,Just a weird thing to me I guess.
14310,Indeed
14311,They are likely referring to the outbreak in Provincetown.
14312,There are several articles on this sub that talk about it.
14313,No shit... what else is new?
14314,"If you look at US States individually, Vermont (where I am) and possibly Massachusetts have hit 80% of eligible population."
14315,Though cases are seeing an upswing in Vermont again--doesn't look to be exponential and might fizzle out on its own--time will tell.

14330,There weren't many where we came from.
14331,Why's that?
14332,I never understood that perspective when it comes to this given that it affects the people around them.
14333,What’s strange to me is that the republicans are the ones who are against any sort of lockdown.
14334,It’s not sound logic to be against lockdown AND against vaccines unless you’re just pro-disease
14335,BS.
14336,Why would we lockdown when we have incredibly effective vaccines?

14349,What is your worry (assuming you're vaccinated)?
14350,"&gt; Now we've seen Delta eventually grant mercy to the UK and other countries, but there's no guarantee that will happen in the US."
14351,"Delta has a R number of between 3 and 8, so it spreads like wildfire."
14352,The wildfire has to end eventually because there is nothing left to burn.
14353,Delta didnt grant mercy - it ran out of victims.
14354,And the same will happen here.
14355,I wanna see research seeing if neuroplasticity could minimize or even fix the effects of Covid on the brain
14356,"So with Broadway now requiring masks for shows, I have to get everyone's opinion."
14357,Would you even wanna watch a show being masked the whole time?
14358,I personally wouldn't and can't imagine too many people are jumping with excitement.
14359,Does New York even fall under the CDCs current guidelines for masking anyway?
14360,Yes the CDC has been getting on my nerves late as of too.
14361,"As much as I personally loved getting to unmask in May, I do feel that they didn’t factor in human behavior."
14362,The same has happened with this new advice as well.
14363,They’ve gone from giving anti-vaxxers no reason to get shots to giving the impression that the vaccines have shortcomings.
14364,Yeah I keep trying to find stuff on longterm but we just don't have that research.
14365,Luckily though it really does seem it's relatively mild for him.
14366,They ran tests on him today (we are on day 4 of symptoms) and there were no signs of pneumonia or oxygen issues.
14367,Just high fever and sore throat but the fever hasn't stayed above 103F for long.
14368,So I am hoping for the best.
14369,"I wasn’t minimizing COVID or the Flu, just trying to give some perspective"
14370,I love all these people crying for their rights when they control the government in the state.

14372,"We could protest, but then they could use their new ""anti-riot"" laws passed this year to charge us with felonies if they choose."
14373,I moved to Florida in 2018 with my family.
14374,I am seriously thinking about leaving this state over the insanity of Covid decisions here.
14375,Dealing with the snow is a small price to pay for a government that cares for more than businesses.
14376,And here’s a quote.
14377,Please stop being rude.
14378,"People who had recovered from COVID-19, including those no longer reporting symptoms, exhibited significant cognitive deficits versus controls when controlling for age, gender, education level, income, racial-ethnic group, pre-existing medical disorders, tiredness, depression and anxiety."
14379,"The deficits were of substantial effect size for people who had been hospitalised (N = 192), but also for non-hospitalised cases who had biological confirmation of COVID-19 infection (N = 326)."
14380,Analysing markers of premorbid intelligence did not support these differences being present prior to infection.
14381,Finer grained analysis of performance across sub-tests supported the hypothesis that COVID-19 has a multi-domain impact on human cognition.
14382,Make the Coronavirus Great Again!!!!!!!
14383,!
14384,"Haha jokes on you CDC, I still haven’t had chicken pox!"
14385,🤣☠️☠️
14386,"So much for preferring ""local control"""
14387,It’s almost hilarious how desperate Abbott is to actively harm his own constituents.
14388,At least Saban is demonstrably sharp.
14389,He may not be a great senator theoretically but he's definitely smarter than Tuberville...
14390,I'm going to a professional conference next week that will require masks.
14391,"That's not ideal, but it still easily beats the alternative of ""attending"" a conference via zoom, which is what happened to every other show in my field since February 2020."
14392,"That said I completely understand why people would decide to pass on purely leisure activities like Broadway, concerts, ball games etc if the only way to go is with masks versus watching from home."
14393,"If you look at the paper itself though it’s entirely about the virus, vaccines aren’t even mentioned."
14394,I don't think that's it.
14395,The problem is we are being told that anything and everything he says is true and factual and to trust 100% in everything he says when in reality it's something new and it's changing and evolving so we should expect a lot of advice/recommendations/research will change/evolve and not all be correct right now.... but that's not the message we are getting.
14396,That's the issue.

“So that’s why, especially when you have a lot of virus circulating in a community, it’s important to take that extra step, go that extra mile, wear that mask in indoor settings, outside the house, so you don’t contribute to transmission.”"

14471,This pandemic has been really good at showing me the states I will never live in.
14472,Florida and Texas are the top two I’ll avoid forever at this point.
14473,"From the article:  
The mobile clinic in the East Colfax neighborhood is part of a new push by Denver-area public health officials to find the neighborhoods where vaccinations lag behind state or county averages."
14474,"Using detailed maps that show vaccines given by ZIP code or census tract, the health departments highlight underperforming areas being masked by a county’s overall vaccination rate."
14475,They then partner with community organizations with intimate knowledge of those neighborhoods to determine strategies to address the specific barriers keeping residents from being inoculated.
14476,"and  
East Colfax topped the department’s priority list."
14477,"The neighborhood, which spans the border between Denver and Aurora, is one of the more impoverished in the metro area, with large numbers of immigrants and minorities, many of whom speak neither English nor Spanish."
14478,"and  
Part of the problem, people in the community told health officials, was transportation."
14479,"Initially, the state had set up mass vaccination clinics in the center of Denver."
14480,"But many East Colfax residents have no car, relying primarily on public transit."
14481,It’s about a 50-minute ride one way on the Route 15 bus to the Ball Arena vaccine site.
14482,"For many, that was too far to venture."
14483,"“It looks great on TV to have these mass clinics where people drive through,” said Judy Shlay, an associate director who runs the immunization program for Denver Public Health, which operates the mobile vaccine clinic."
14484,"“But we have to be more agile and flexible for people who are maybe more hesitant to go downtown, or because they have to take three buses to get there.”"
14485,If someone is concerned for their health they should probably get vaccinated or not be around anyone for the foreseeable future.
14486,Wearing a seatbelt and injections are wildly different as one involves regulating literal bodies and not comparable.
14487,"Otherwise, when Texas bans abortions, people could say “this is for the greater good in helping the children, We require seatbelts so why can’t we require this regulation, if it is in the name of an innocent life?” It’s truly a slippery slope and therefore a hill worth dying on."
14488,It is definitely about personal liberty and if all the government learns from this is that “mandates don’t solve problems” then it is a mission accomplished in my book.
14489,"I have been anti police and government my whole life and I don’t see any reason to change my tune now, sorry Charlie."
14490,Yeah now borderline everyone here can get it with almost no effort if they want it.
14491,Everywhere has openings on every day with an easy way to schedule the shot including day of scheduling.
14492,Rural people still make trips to non-rural areas (assuming it isn’t available in rural areas which it typically is).

14523,I'm not saying they are wrong just curious.
14524,Scotts assumptions make sense to me.
14525,I think it's reasonable young people are not getting tested because they aren't that sick and in general are less likely to go to doctors or worry about minor symptoms.
14526,Vaccinated people are almost certainly less likely to get tested.
14527,My office is 95 percent valued.
14528,Tons of sniffles and coughs but no one is getting tested.
14529,"Thirdly, a huge portion of spread is taking place amongst anti-vax/mask."
14530,Those people are also very unlikely to get tested unless they are in extremely bad condition.
14531,"Maybe the cdc estimates take all of that into consideration, but if not them I think they are way off."
14532,"If history repeats, I can see them all eventually getting vaccinated, claiming it wasn't them that were arguing against it and somehow blaming ""the radical left"" for it all."

14544,"Wouldn't you call the greater viral load and transmissibility than its predecessors, a mutation?"
14545,"Perhaps I don't know the definition of mutation, but clearly the earlier variants didnt present this way."
14546,"I wouldn't call this a ""worst case scenario""."
14547,"The minute they said ""this virus mutates"", everyone should have been able to draw the conclusion that this was a likely scenario - especially knowing this wasnt a US problem and it would have to be contained globally to stop mutation."
14548,In what world was that realistic?
14549,"I'm not saying you stop following the science, but many many people are acting like this couldnt have been foreseen and that they've been lied to."

14551,The science told us this was a likely scenario.
14552,Not a hunch.
14553,"I think the issue is that a lot of them were vaccinated right before, when the single shot vaccine takes 4-6 weeks to reach efficacy."

14632,*
14633,I have a friend who claims she is fully vaccinated (not sure if I believe her at this point).
14634,Her husband refuses to be vaccinated and doesn't wear a mask.
14635,She has two children - one is 13 and eligible for vaccination and the other is 10 with a history of severe allergies and asthma.
14636,"She initially said that she was ""waiting for more data"" on vaccination in children and that once it's fully approved, she'll vaccinate her kids."
14637,She intends to send her kids back to school in the fall (she homeschooled them this past year) and thinks that mandatory masking (not vaccines) will be all that is necessary.
14638,"She recently changed her tune and said that she would ""reconsider"" vaccination after full FDA approval, but then started going on about how the government cannot mandate vaccines."
14639,She's not going to have her kids vaccinated.
14640,"Just the other day, she contacted me in a panic because her younger son had worsening upper respiratory symptoms that necessitated an urgent doctor appointment."
14641,She said her husband was freaked out and finally put on a mask.
14642,"Fortunately, the COVID test came back negative, but now the family is back to business as usual."
14643,No vaccines for the husband and older kid and no masking for the husband.
14644,She claims they don't go anywhere (except church which she inexplicably doesn't count) and the kids are masked whenever they do go out.
14645,So what the heck does she think is going to happen once her kids are back in school?
14646,Her poor kid got sick when he's supposedly hardly around others and is not in school or camp and he's masked up.
14647,The really sad thing is that her anxiety has always had an effect on her children.
14648,"Her children, especially the younger one, are terrified of catching this virus."
14649,So she freaked her kids out over this and is denying her older one the vaccine and her husband is refusing the vaccine (which would at least help in protecting his unvaccinated kids).
14650,"They’re clearly trying to scare vaccine fence-sitters into rolling up their sleeves, while all I think they’re gonna accomplish is convince people who got vaccinated in April/May to “stay home as much as possible” again."

Because they've been conditioned to adhere to certain patterns of behavrour and which are usually some combination of :

1) Always stick it to the libs because republicans are louder, simpler to understand and therefore must be right

2) Refuse to run with the crowd because it makes them feel like a rebel who is strong, important and obviously smarter than the masses (this is rooted in deep-seated insecurity about how dumb they realize they probably are on some level) so feeling like a rebel helps to make them feel big in their own mind

3) Fear about getting involved in a scenario that up 'till now doesn't seem to have affected anyone they've met or normally interact with."

It's not fair to people who are trying to stay safe and lookout for others

It's not fair to immuno-compromised people who can't get the vaccine and so are being dragged into risking death against their will to no gain of theirs whatsoever

It's not fair to businesses who've had to stay closed and go bankrupt because they can't safely open

14897,"The mandate, unveiled in a staff memo Friday, doesn’t apply to its store and warehouse staffers, the bulk of its workforce."
14898,Instead it is encouraging those employees to get vaccinated by offering a $150 bonus.
14899,Maybe thats the point.

15039,&gt;What needs to happen for schools to open safely?
15040,"School closures have impacted children on many fronts, from academics and social interaction, to equity, food security, and mental health."
15041,"The CDC recently released guidelines for opening schools, noting that decisions about when and how to safely open schools should consider levels of community transmission."
15042,"&gt;The guidelines prioritize five key mitigation strategies, which, when layered together, should minimize the spread of COVID-19 in schools:

&gt;universal, correct use of masks that cover the mouth and nose
physical distancing
frequent hand washing
cleaning high-touch surfaces and maintaining healthy facilities
contact tracing, in combination with isolation and quarantine."
15043,"&gt;The CDC guidelines for physical distancing vary by school level and degree of community transmission, and they assume that everyone is masked."
15044,"The CDC recommends at least 3 feet between students in elementary, middle, and high schools when community transmission is low or moderate."
15045,"When transmission is high, students should be divided into separate groups, called cohorts, that maintain 6 feet of distance from other cohorts throughout the day."
15046,"The CDC also recommends a minimum of 6 feet between teachers and students at all times, and a minimum distance of 6 feet when masks are off, such as during lunch time."
15047,"&gt;The guidelines also recommend improving ventilation, by opening windows and doors, for example."
15048,"Ideally, schools should have access to testing for students and teachers with symptoms, as well as routine screening to identify asymptomatic cases."
15049,"And while they acknowledge that vaccination of teachers is important, they do not require it before returning to school."
15050,&gt;Are kids any more or less likely than adults to spread coronavirus?
15051,"Most children who become infected with the COVID-19 virus have no symptoms, or they have milder symptoms such as low-grade fever, fatigue, and cough."
15052,Early studies suggested that children do not contribute much to the spread of coronavirus.
15053,But more recent studies raise concerns that children could be capable of spreading the infection.
15054,"&gt;Though the recent studies varied in their methods, their findings were similar: infected children had as much, or more, coronavirus in their upper respiratory tracts as infected adults."
15055,&gt;The amount of virus found in children — their viral load — was not correlated with the severity of their symptoms.
15056,"In other words, more virus did not mean more severe symptoms."
15057,"&gt;Finding high amounts of viral genetic material — these studies measured viral RNA, not live virus — in kids does not prove that children are infectious."
15058,"However, the presence of high viral loads in infected children does increase the concern that children, even those without symptoms, could readily spread the infection to others."

15174,"Yes, they do have a few cocktails, cruise the bars, and network (for lack of a better word)."
15175,"The situations that led to this, could have just as easily involved any social group (e.g."
15176,motorcycle riders at Sturgis last year).
15177,"It just happened that this one had a decent number of vaccinated individuals, and there was (for lack of a better description) significant transmission."
15178,"So keep in mind that this happened to be one event, for which the surveillance was very good at spotting, and which triggered a closer look at the circumstances."
15179,"There may have been other events, having nothing to do with LGBTQ, in which similar transmission is ongoing."
15180,Not to mention those breakthrough deaths skew towards the elderly and car fatalities toward the younger.
15181,So if you’re young your odds of dying in a car crash are immensely more
15182,"If it reduces your chances of being symptomatic, won’t the vaccinated be spreading it asymptotically?"
15183,"Some loud mouth Republican radio host here in the city of “good neighbors” in buffalo NY , demanded that ALL children’s deaths be discounted if the dead child had say, cancer or asthma , and died of covid ."

15191,That's an outright lie I had to get tested last month for surgery and the options I had were multiple different drive up testing sites just for UC Health
15192,The stupid parents will just blame the teachers for striking instead of the politicians.
15193,A teacher’s strike just won’t do anything because critical thought is severely lacking.
15194,"No, that was not the context."
15195,I was pointing out that the profit AZ was hoping for was good PR.
15196,"But they screwed up a lot and behaved in an appalling manner instead of apologising, so all the good PR went down the drain and they are mainly left with a massively damaged reputation."

15210,We should be aiming to experience no deaths related to covid.
15211,11 deaths seems small to people until one of those individuals is your family member.
15212,I can’t figure out why people can say “only whatever random number of deaths” so nonchalantly as if we didn’t lose 500k people due to covid in a short amount of time.
15213,We should be doing better and being a lot more cautious especially after getting absolutely effed last year.

So this is a worrying issue for people are unwillingly unvaccinated, like young children and the immunocompromised."
15279,But as of yet it’s not an issue of “The vaccines are no longer protecting us.” It’s that people who can’t be protected properly by the vaccines yet are now in more danger.
15280,Yeah I’m so tired of seeing “what’s the big deal?

15293,"The only conclusion is that viral loads in symptomatic patients are equal to those in non vaccinated, whereas previously vaccinated individuals had ~30% lower viral loads."
15294,But the datasets here are tiny as they only had the Ct values(viral load) of ~120 vaccinated people.
15295,“The findings in this report are subject to at least four limitations.

15307,"You are making the assumption that every time I go out without a mask I have COVID or I will definitively come in contact with someone with COVID, which is a false premise fallacy."
15308,"Since, I am vaccinated it only lowers that chance of contracting or spreading a virus that I am immune from."
15309,Which is why making a law that criminalizes NOT wearing a mask in public would criminalize people who neither have COVID or came into contact with anyone with COVID.
15310,Unlike NOT wearing pants where you are objectively waving your penis at people in the street.
15311,"Would you like to justify why you would charge someone for not wearing a mask if they are not COVID positive, have not been in contact with COVID positive person, and vaccinated?"

15348,"Agreed, some of the earlier comments in this thread were saying the exact opposite of what was said in the article though, hence my comment."
15349,Probably worded it poorly
15350,Don’t forget the death toll and economic damage from when Texas literally froze over and had no power because he and the rest of the Texas state government ignored all recommendations of winterizing our power infrastructure.

15396,You are correct.
15397,I should have said that the CDCs own data suggests that a serious breakthrough infection that leads to hospitalization or death is extremely low.

15667,People here also love to talk about the inevitable super variant that will evade all vaccines but there really doesn't seem to be much evidence that this is happening/will happen.

15750,"(And if we are at 1 million cases, then it's not just low deaths, it's an almost complete lack of symptoms if no one is bothering to get tested."
15751,But this goes against all the publicity about Delta putting people in hospitals more easily.)
15752,"I am too lazy, but I wonder what implied case number we would get to by looking at deaths versus expected death rates by age group/vaccination."
15753,"Re: deaths, it is a pretty good point that elderly people are very heavily vaccinated, so it makes sense for deaths to be drastically lower."

15861,"Also, while movie theater audiences are shoveling snacks and soft drinks into their mouths for almost the entirety of the show, Broadway audiences members are more likely to not eat or drink."
15862,Or maybe have one glass of wine or something at the beginning and intermission.
15863,"So ""masks-while-not-eating"" still isn't nearly as effective as vaccines but it isn't as utterly useless as if it were a Marvel movie screening or something."
15864,"I love how we have to hear about and listen to the same people that thought trickle down economics, the Vietnam War, Segregation, Anti-LGBT laws, tax breaks for the rich, the Iraq war, and Donald Trump were good ideas telling me that I am not allowed to protect myself from a pandemic that has killed millions."

15918,Vaccines are supposed to *prevent* 95% of hospitalizations *that would otherwise happen*.
15919,"Meeting this number requires much less than 5% of people in contact with the virus to be hospitalized, because not every unvaccinated person in contact with the virus would be hospitalized either."

15976,Why were such a high percentage symptomatic infections?
15977,I thought most vaccinated cases were asymptomatic?
15978,Is the logic the the asymptomatic weren't included in the testing because they didn't know?

15996,They didn't have a choice to get the vaccine at the time.
15997,"The fact that you have a vaccine available and think you know more than doctors and scientists...I'm sorry, nobody deserves to get the virus but it's very hard to not say told you so."

16001,"It's fine not to care, and like you I've done my part by getting double-vaccinated (quickly) and keeping on wearing masks and distancing and whatnot."
16002,But that said I will care if I still manage to get infected as a result of people drawing this out longer and longer and longer.
16003,"If the virus still persists, then we don't get back to normal with any expedience, and with the variant cases showing up in the states ([even](https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/ououoy/cdc_study_shows_threefourths_of_people_infected/) [with](https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/oumw9j/vaccination_is_not_enough_by_itself_to_stop_the/) a [vaccine](https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/ousiun/at_least_125000_vaccinated_americans_have_tested/)), even a smaller amount just brought on by aberrant events and the Delta variant, it won't be surprising if whatever place we're all in right now-- pinning it on theatre or whatever-- keeps going through 2022."

16013,There's no winning.
16014,Sometimes the magnetic field created by the vaccine isn't strong enough to pull in enough bars of the 5G signal to fully protect you.

16073,Dude wants to be President so bad is going to kill a few more people to prove it
16074,66% would be right inline with what Israel's original studies on Pfizer vs Delta were.
16075,They've since come back and said Fully Vaccinated with Pfizer vs Delta is only has a 40% efficacy against symptomatic infections.

16133,When he was first elected he toned the rhetoric down.

16282,They are fully in the clear to offer customers straight up cash to get it.
16283,And?
16284,Grocery workers are probably all vaccinated
16285,What exactly is a reasonable path forward at this point?
16286,"I don’t mean the question to come across as antagonistic, more fatalistic."
16287,The cat is out of the bag.
16288,People are over any form of restrictions.
16289,"If things are as dire as this report suggests, I just don’t see any reasonably effective way to mitigate what’s to come."
16290,"All I know is that at this point, I’m not going back in the office unless everyone in my household is vaccinated, or the transmission drops below 1% locally on a sustained basis."
16291,Honestly they should have never quit  source: past sub teacher.
16292,"Like I said earlier, mask mandates likely won’t be as wide spread this time around."
16293,It’s gonna be more mixed
16294,"I know you got downvoted, but honestly, if a vax viral load is the same as a no vax viral load, what IS the vaccine doing?"
16295,you assume that they stopped testing on the day the first shot was given.
16296,they are almost 18 months into this.
16297,"""less than two years"" you'll say."
16298,"you'll have to define ""safe"" for yourself, look at the hundreds of millions (Perhaps billions at this point, i'm not sure) shots given and the side effects thereof and compare it to data from people who have not received shots."
16299,But if one person (who was wary) got the vaccine then another family member would probably stand up and get it and so on.
16300,"But by getting the shot but saying they didn’t get it, and not getting sick, shows the anti-vaxxers “look Karl didn’t get sick” kinda crap."
16301,That’s all I’m getting at.
16302,&gt;life is not fair I guess?
16303,"Ok cool, now you've spited me enough that if I don't get that $100 dollars, I'll go to republican circles and discourage as many people as possible from getting the vaccine cuz ""life's not fair"""
16304,Wat free rider problem meen
16305,[removed]
16306,I went through the slides.
16307,The only new piece of information is the viral load of breakthroughs.
16308,The rest is all known data and studies.
16309,Those things only effect the individual.
16310,Eating a burger because you're fat doesn't spread fat disease
16311,Can the unvaccinated wear a special hat so we can identify them
16312,That is a great point.
16313,"Also every time it spreads there is increased risk of mutation that escapes the current vaccines, especially if it finds an immunocompromised host."
16314,Oh my gosh that’s horrific!
16315,I’m so glad your nephew is home now beyond scary!
16316,Do they have any idea where he got it?
16317,To not have ambulances is beyond scary.
16318,Who outlaws masks!!!
16319,Ugh!

16323,"Kanter attributed the surge to a ""perfect storm"" of factors, including the Delta variant, which is believed to be more transmissible, and ""unacceptably low vaccination coverage."""
16324,"Harkening back to the early days of the pandemic, Our Lady of the Lake Regional Medical Center on Monday halted the scheduling of non-urgent surgical procedures that would require an inpatient bed."
16325,Everyone saw the data from Israel and Chile and started jumping through hoops to claim the data was wrong.
16326,I believe Chile's peak was at 70% vaxed.
16327,I'm guessing that 99% number that people are leaning so heavily on isn't going to operative much longer.

16334,I wish that I knew what to do.
16335,"This has all be reasonably easy to follow up until this exact point in time - distance, stay home, mask up, then get the vaccine, then things almost felt normal."
16336,Now?
16337,How do I navigate work?
16338,Home?
16339,Shopping?
16340,"What do I do, as a fully vaccinated obese middle aged guy?"
16341,But God forbid anyone bring up the L word again.
16342,2 of 4 vaccinated members of my wife's immediate family  have breakthrough cases now.
16343,One passed it to my 8y/o.
16344,Thank you good to know!
16345,I still think that’s not the most crazy all things considered.
16346,We have no idea how many people were exposed so seeing numbers like this is just harsh and really easy to manipulate.
16347,"We have studies for effectiveness, we pretty much know."
16348,It doesn't seem like natural immunity is helping much against mutations.
16349,"""And Jesus said unto the people, When God’s people are in need, be ready to help them."

16361,My 83 year old grandma who’s on an oxygen tank got her vaccine in secret so my Qamom wouldn’t find out
16362,I’m vaccinated.
16363,Was pointing out how they’re absolutely NOT more dangerous than anti-vaxxers.
16364,Not admitting you did something g good is in no way worse than doing something bad.
16365,I mean that acceptance and new approach will probably mean masks.
16366,It’s basically to late for them to vaccinate.
16367,Delta is going to burn through them quick and fast over the next couple of weeks.
16368,The time to get vaccinated was a month ago.
16369,That's completely idiotic
16370,Can you share this announcement?
16371,I saw where the founder is requiring them at his fine dining establishments on Washington / New York but nothing about Shake Shack.
16372,I don’t know the viability of a quick service restaurant trying to implement this.
16373,"Oof, that's not the way to get folks to listen to your advice."
16374,Coming in hot!
16375,"If you guys want some good news, saw a tweet where someone they went to an orgy where someone tested positive and basically everyone ended up testing negative despite that."
16376,Woo
16377,"So many people on here were parroting things like ""theres no evidence that vaxed people can spread it"" and it looks like the CDC drank the same kool-aid."
16378,"Folks, ""no evidence"" is not a very good argument."
16379,It means we dont have data.
16380,"Reminds me of ""no evidence covid spreads on planes"" which is true in that we do zero contact tracing."
16381,Hope you feel better soon.
16382,Almost impossible to avoid Delta down in FL.
16383,"My ""goal"" is to not reward stupidity and laziness."
16384,If this happens I absolutely will be willing to wait next time because I know a better deal is coming
16385,"This doesnt seem like anything overly new, just more of what was already mentioned, Delta variant more virulent, vaccine isn't 100% (no vaccine is), 99% of severe covid is from unvaxxed people...Basically telling everybody to get the damn shot."
16386,[removed]
16387,"Also DoD employee here...

Biden just announced:

Government employees will be asked to attest to their vaccination status, and if not test 1 or 2 times a week to see if they have acquired covid."
16388,This will be interesting to say the least.
16389,that's exactly what it was.
16390,"And it didn't entice enough idiots to get the vaccine,  and there weren't any ways to enforce restrictions,  so now it's back to masks."
16391,While I hope it motivates hold outs - there is no reason that I should miss out on the cash just because I was responsible.
16392,I imagine most of that money will go to people getting vaccinated a second time and not to hold outs though.
16393,Must be the deep state.
16394,I've had a few people tell me they won't get the vaccine even for $5000...
16395,I don't believe them but they said it.
16396,I can't understand people.
16397,Probably because they bothered/able to contact trace?
16398,"Well, funny thing."
16399,Not all nurses are vaccinated.
16400,Some are pretty antivax themselves.
16401,The cdc guidance to go to masking is just going to give people a false sense of security.
16402,Vaccinated people with a cloth mask on in a crowded nightclub are going to get clobbered.
16403,Guidance should have been masking and avoidance of crowded indoor spaces.
16404,Or the ones who get their faces injected with Botox and fillers yet say that same line of “the vaccine is toxic!”
16405,Yeah the gaps also bother me a lot.
16406,And the fact I haven’t seen this article on other news sources (I guess yet it could gain traction idk).
16407,I too would also like to know if it’s a sore throat or like having problems breathing.
16408,That’s such a wide range.
16409,And to add having friends from college (and visiting this place with them) I’ve gotten sick every time lol.
16410,It’s always been a madhouse when I’ve been there.
16411,You have your life.
16412,You have to make the best of your circumstances.

16414,10k what?
16415,Those of us with J&amp;J are pretty nervous
16416,Do what you have to to stay alive.
16417,Absolutely absurd but... whatever.
16418,"If everyone gets vaccinated, then it'll be ""just like the flu""."
16419,A very bad flu because everyone is going to get it.
16420,"And if you don't get vaccinated,  you have a much higher chance of serious injury and death."
16421,I just learned that LAUSD will be offering the option of online classes this fall.
16422,That might cut down on the number of in person students that need to be tested.
16423,"I had assumed that all 600,000 would be in person."
16424,The last line of this article in my mind says it best.
16425,"https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2021/07/29/cdc-mask-guidance/

As soon as we accept that covid will be with us for ever let’s move into a new approach."
16426,good.

16449,More power to ya!
16450,"Yea, it’s deja vu all over again"
16451,I thought the CDC was specifically denied funding to research gun violence by Congress years ago?
16452,This isn’t true.
16453,"Data is becoming more clear that vaccinated people can in fact spread the virus, a lot more easily than was previously thought at least."
16454,And there's plenty FREE vaccines for anyone over the age of 12 for months?
16455,**Just to add one additional piece of info that seems to be missing from the article: Sputnik V is the only vaccine where (for some reason) the second dose is different from the first (and they are not interchangeable).
16456,"**

**That makes reliable delivery timelines especially important."
16457,"With any other vaccine a government could keep as many of them on the shelf (stored for second shots) as they see fit (20%, 30%, 50%), depending how regular/reliable the flow of the vaccine is."
16458,"** *[[For example, because Astrazeneca deliveries were so unreliable, most countries had 50% of the doses sitting on the shelf in order to ensure that people would get their second shot in time."
16459,"]]*

**With Sputnik, you don't have that possibility."
16460,"** *[[Of course, in theory, governments could have shelved 100% of first doses of Sputnik and only start vaccinations once the second doses arrive."
16461,But countries using Sputnik did so because of an emergency situation and they did not have the luxury to wait that long.
16462,"]]* **So, whatever the reason is that the second doses of Sputnik are just not being produced or delivered, you now have the situation that in a lot of countries across Latin America there are large numbers of singe-jabbed people that are not getting the chance to have their second jabs."
16463,"** *[[Russia has already artificially extended the permissible gap between the doses, but they still canot fulfill orders in time."
16464,"]]*

**So you now have the very real possibility that a lot of countries, especially in Latin America are basically having to write off all those people who already received their first Sputnik shot as unvaccinated and having to start their vaccination campagin all over again."
16465,They essentially lost a full four or five months of time in the middle of a race against the pandemic.
16466,"The magnitude of that impact** (medically, economically, psychologically, politically) **is something that people not living in these countries often fail to grasp."
16467,**
16468,"Have not seen mention of this before, isn't Sturgis ready to kick off in like a week?"
16469,Just get vaccinated again and collect the money.
16470,It’s almost like that’s why we have a vaccine
16471,Lol.
16472,We’re more concerned with unvaccinated but I hear you.
16473,"The anti vaxx crowd is so insane and untrusting of science that there is NOTHING the CDC could have said in the past, or could say in the future."
16474,We were doomed from the start.
16475,We live in Idiocracy.
16476,"Well, there it is."
16477,Even the vaccines are not enough to keep the virus from spreading exponentially.
16478,The implications are huge.
16479,Vaccination is no longer a viable solution.
16480,We're going to be living this way for a very long time.
16481,"&gt; It cites a combination of recently obtained, still-unpublished data from outbreak investigations and outside studies showing that vaccinated individuals infected with delta may be able to transmit the virus as easily as those who are unvaccinated."
16482,"Vaccinated people infected with delta have measurable viral loads similar to those who are unvaccinated and infected with the variant.&gt; 

So delta spreads from vaccinated people as easily as unvaccinated and is more contagious then chickenpox."
16483,The Science calls for Universal Masking going even further than the CDC did.
16484,[removed]
16485,All this would explain the increasing numbers of reports of entire vaccinated families getting infected.
16486,That sounds like a good approach.
16487,I hope my government gets something similar going now that they’ve started approving some of the at-home tests
16488,It’s moving me.
16489,I’m getting vaccinated again just to collect the money.
16490,Going to need a booster soon anyways.
16491,Agreed and absolutely true.
16492,Singapore was reporting infections of (Pfizer) vaccinated individuals with the Delta variant back in June.
16493,CDC was slow to respond.
16494,They should have known better.
16495,[deleted]
16496,"Previous variants had much less viral load and vaccinated people were much less likely to transmit it to others, so vaccinated people not having to wear masks made sense based on that."
16497,The difference now is the much higher viral load and transmissibility of the Delta variant such that vaccinated people aren’t *quite* as protected anymore (but still significantly protected) and aren’t the barrier to transmission that they once were.
16498,Very true about the people on the left hiding it.
16499,Everyone thinks it’s just the right but there are a lot of people that for some reason are hesitant to get the vax and are either lying or just masking and not getting the vax.
16500,It’d be a hard sell with the current numbers in most areas.
16501,[removed]
16502,Fucking hell.
16503,Narrator: the vaccine kept on a-mutating.
16504,Country’s full of debt no one gives a shit clearly.
16505,I’m just going to get vaccinated all over again as a booster and collect the cash.
16506,Some of The people at the mass vaccine site in my area had fake name tags in case wackos got upset over something.
16507,Not surprised.
16508,"It's not 800 cases total
.but 800 they could trace to this one outbreak"
16509,At this point it’s fair to say it’s vaccinated people as well.
16510,"There's tw major gaps in the information here 

What is being defined as showing symptoms?"
16511,"If they're defining things that could contributed to allegories in the middle of summer that's worthless 

How many vaccinated people in the area were actually exposed during this time frame vs the breakthroughs?"
16512,"If you have 10,000 vaccinated people that were exposed in this time frame and place that suddenly changes the data drastically"
16513,Or a kid under 12
16514,I have an ER nurse family member.
16515,"She said:

Our hospital is filling up again."
16516,Almost all unvaccinated.
16517,People expect us to panic and be shocked when they say they have Covid.
16518,No one cares anymore.
16519,We’ve been doing this for a year and a half.
16520,And you didn’t want the vaccine so I don’t feel sorry for you.
16521,🤷🏼‍♀️
16522,This is an awful thing to print.
16523,Household transmission rates are 80-90%.
16524,"No, alas."
16525,That experiment was done in a test tube.
16526,"What would still need to be done to get to the finish line:

* do a whole.lot more *in vitro* experiments, to turn it into a prospective treatment
* See if it worked in animals and didn't kill them
* Go through a series of safety trials, gradually increasing in scope
* Show that it's better (more effective, and/or safer) than the best available alternative (which is the vaccinations we have now and the improved versions we'll have then)"
16527,"Yeah, that’s a good point, but it would be great for catching asymptomatic transmission."
16528,"Or as an extra precaution for people who have allergies, acid reflux, or migraines and other conditions that cause symptoms similar to some of the covid ones (runny / stuffy nose, sore throat, etc)."
16529,It’s unrealistic for those people to self-isolate 100% of the time indefinitely.
16530,"Of course, the rapid tests would need to be reasonably accurate."
16531,"Since you’d be doing them every day, they probably wouldn’t need to be as sensitive as the brain swab pcr ones you can get from health providers."
16532,i.e whereas pcr tests might pick up the positive over the course of e.g.
16533,"2 weeks, the rapid ones might just get it when your viral load is highest, so maybe just the middle week or something."
16534,But that’s when you’re most infectious in any case.
16535,Or at least that’s a general argument I’ve read in favour of widespread rapid testing.
16536,"But who knows, could be misinformation I guess."
16537,I agree that if you’re feeling sick (i.e.
16538,"something other than your status quo, since a significant part of the population has some kind of condition that causes at least one of the long list of potential covid symptoms on a constant or regular basis), or have been exposed to covid, it’s best to stay home in any case, and get a lab test since they’re more accurate."
16539,"But for everyday testing, I think the rapid tests would be helpful."
16540,It would ultimately come down to how good they are at detecting whether someone’s infectious.
16541,Not whether they’re as sensitive as the lab pcr tests.
16542,Which is what they’ve often been compared against
16543,I know that.
16544,Still don’t believe it’s a major part of the lack of getting shots so far.
16545,"Lol, if you zoom in on the graph there are fluctuations of that size every few days."
16546,"And, if none of that scares you, in the US covid has a much higher chance of costing you a fuckload of money."
16547,I dont agree but I can understand your train of logic.
16548,"As someone sitting at home on quarantine with breakthrough, symptomatic covid (Pfizer, March), I’ve been coming to that conclusion myself."
16549,We will not be able to vaccinate the entire world at once so variants will continue to develop in hotspots.
16550,A very virulent strain like delta tearing through the world fairly quickly has a better chance of creating widespread immunity.
16551,"&gt;	It’s pretty shameful, tbh."
16552,OP made of a bullshit editorialized title.
16553,The original title translated doesn’t say a single thing about anyone protesting against the vaccine.
16554,Where are all of these protests in the UK and United States?
16555,"It doesn’t seem right to be able to post an article in another language, and make up your own title and narrative."
16556,Of course not.
16557,"And that’s not a fair comparison, being gay doesn’t affect the health of you family and others."
16558,"This is a world wide pandemic, think of something other than yourself, get vaccinated, get your loved ones vaccinated."
16559,If the south needs a better reason?
16560,More Democrats are getting vaccinated.
16561,"I don’t care, just do the right thing."
16562,"millions are dying every month worldwide, and he thinks its a joke"
16563,Vaccines are a tool to halt spread.
16564,Not the whole ballgame as we’ve treated them
16565,That’s definitely how it is here.
16566,"I know plenty of people who are vaccine hesitant, but are lying and saying they were vaccinated."
16567,"There isn’t any reason for anyone to get “vaccinated in secret here”, because the population falls into two main groups."
16568,"People who will shame others for not getting vaccinated, and then people who say “it’s everyone’s personal choice so do what you want”."
16569,The only people here with any reason to lie are those two don’t want the backlash from not getting the vaccine.
16570,Looking at you India.
16571,And screw the responsible citizens who got the vaccination without bribing.
16572,Like women who are poor and on welfare who receive benefits for each kids without being required to use birth control.
16573,Negative!
16574,Going home baby woooo
16575,"Also, it seems like a lot of people are way too afraid of side effects from the vaccine."
16576,"When you look at the google trends data, in a lot of states, people are searching for the side effects a lot."
16577,I feel it's hurting the vaccination campaign.
16578,I’m more worried about the “I lived but now have long term chronic health issues that are both limiting and expensive.”
16579,I ain't sticking nothing nowhere anymore in my body.
16580,"What society wants, that's their fucking problem."
16581,Get fucked lmaoo.
16582,Fuck society.
16583,This part at least.
16584,You are much less likely to be infected and much less likely to become seriously ill if you are infected.
16585,"When people say you can still get COVID, the emphasis is on ""can."""
16586,"As in, you *can* get struck by lightning in a storm or bit by a shark in the ocean."
16587,It's like holding on to a lightning rod in a storm because you might still get hit even if you let go.
16588,Been great.

16670,You're 32.

16674,Covid has spread in the 7 person office I am in twice in the last 2 months.
16675,I was a new hire and one of the 2 vaccinated.

16700,No doubt some disinformation campaigns in there as well.
16701,"I blame the unvaccinated no doubt, but there's not a question social media and their toxic echo chambers allow it to spiral out of control."
16702,"Before the days of social media, such fringe ideas could never catch on and they would be ousted by society."
16703,"Now social media is just a place for people to confirm their biases for stupid ideas and find ""community"" that understands them."
16704,"A breeding ground for stupidity, if you will."
16705,"I fundamentally think education needs to be improved, you know more statistics class and more critical thinking."

16711,I'd be really interested to see the plan on how LAUSD intends to accomplish this.
16712,"There are over 600,000 students, over 25,000 teachers and over 50,000 other employees in the district."
16713,This is for government  buildings not for all places just to let you know.
16714,Maybe it'd be best to offer J&amp;J to these people since it's so hard to get them to come in.
16715,This is news about a school district.
16716,Teachers right now are not required to be vaccinated.
16717,Children under 12 are not vaccinated.
16718,"Wait until you hear the ""74% of new deaths in the UK are in fully vaccinated people"" headlines!"
16719,The reality is that vaccinated older people are still the most at risk from the virus.
16720,And almost every single older person in the UK is double vaccinated right now.
16721,"Therefore any of them who get sick, or die, will be counted as a fully vaccinated person getting sick or dying."
16722,Its really nothing to freak out over.
16723,Without the vaccines the numbers would be drastically higher
16724,Smart folk down there.

16910,It was NEVER to vaccinate everyone.
16911,Now people move the goalposts as they go for the power grab and people like you want to just keep handing your rights over.
16912,"I agree with those who want a novel vaccine to get it, and those who don't want it (because they are being scientific and know we don't have long term data) having the right to not take it."
16913,"This is a virus for which 98%-99% of people will have no complications, and the vast majority of people who do have underlying issues."
16914,With those kinds of numbers this is not the kind of virus for which we should mandate people to get vaccinated.
16915,"If it was dropping healthy people dead of all ages and had an insane mortality rate, maybe then we could make an exception, THIS IS NOT THAT CASE."
16916,"EVERYTHING I have said is in line with what science says and what the data shows, so if you disagree with it, back it up in your response"

16919,I will be in bed several days - big deal.
16920,And then I will have some natural immunity.
16921,And yet some of is could have used thst money who already got vaccinated.

16923,"This quote refers to the nationwide percentage:

16935,People gonna die yo.
16936,"Yep, get a shot, grab a mask, let’s do this."
16937,I have the vaccine and have been exposed a hundred times over with no adverse affects.
16938,Enough about strip clubs though.

16951,40% not vaxxed.
16952,Natural immunity is starting to look better than the vaccine to reduce symptoms.
16953,Peace out ✌️
16954,"lmao yeah they are

i'm sure Biden's team has a strategy to get the states to comply with that"
16955,"&gt; there is no clear reason for a non-risk group to get vaxxed

Assuming the vaccine is safe (which the science so far shows it is), the clear reason to get vaxxed is simply to greatly reduce your chances of getting sick."

16974,Shewww…okay you can proceed to the nearest echo chamber now.

16980,And if we are ever in this situation again it will teach us to hold out some dont get screwed.

17031,I really don’t.
17032,There’s no reason to.
17033,The vaccines work and you can literally decide to get one whenever you want.

17035,You either get it or you don’t
17036,"Wise precautions , wish you well"
17037,Just from the rumors I’ve heard.
17038,This might not age well though as the CDC finally announced that they will release the studies tomorrow to support their policy revision.
17039,"Most of my dozen staff are staying masked at work and in public - we’re all vaccinated but work in a place with thousands of visitors per day, mostly unvaxxed and unmasked (lots of kids and a distressing number of proudly unvaxxed adults)."

17122,"No, I mean like when someone says “I have faith in God”."
17123,That sounds like “I trust the science” to a lot of people.
17124,Especially since most of the people who are saying “I trust the science” aren’t ever looking at studies or data themselves.
17125,"It’s just a reliance, or trust, in what the media is reporting as “the science”."
17126,I'm in the same exact situation.

17139,1.

17147,Picture the typical US political map...
17148,You sure about that?
17149,Being persuaded to believe something based on your demographic isn't really a good gauge of sanity.
17150,"My point is the reality of this entire situation, be it people denying the benefits of vaccines or people desperately trying to push normalcy without a view of a bigger picture (which is just as much of a factor in the current resurgence of the virus as anything else whether you want to admit it or not), is that people are selfish."
17151,And assuming they'll do anything outside of selfish means is a pipedream.
17152,For a lot of us out there we have no other choice.
17153,It's the only way we can keep the lights on.
17154,"You can call me pessimistic if you want, but I haven't seen much lately to be optimistic about, so...you know whatever."
17155,"&gt; Also, if I show up to the emergency room--unvaccinated--for a laceration, they're going to test me for covid."
17156,"If I show my vaccination card, they aren't going to test me."
17157,That's my understanding anyway.
17158,This depends on individual hospital practices.
17159,"For instance, UCSF [tests everyone (see tweet 10/20)](https://twitter.com/Bob_Wachter/status/1419515401159905283) that is hospitalized or comes through their ED even if they have no symptoms."
17160,"Call it ""Vaccine 45,"" or something."
17161,"[Vericella's R0 is 3.7 - 5.0](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5436649/), so that seems about right based on the estimates R0's of Delta."

17164,Darwinisim*
17165,"""There's censorship and then there's deleting comments by people who are here to argue in bad faith""


Lmao that's the definition of censorship."
17166,What you just replied is one of the most idiotic replies I've ever read.
17167,I'm all for the close contacts no longer needing to isolate because I'm all about numbers and data and those people weren't infecting others by and large.
17168,It was overkill.
17169,"But actual confirmed cases not needing to isolate is straight up insane and laughing in the face of science, data and what we know already."
17170,Well that is just insane.
17171,On the bright side there will be lots of cheap houses for sale shortly.
17172,It's been all over the news lately https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/growing-number-of-republicans-urge-vaccinations-amid-delta-surge/2021/07/20/52a06e9c-e999-11eb-8950-d73b3e93ff7f_story.html
17173,Yeah!
17174,Because those people never had lives or have to go to work or take care of kids or provide for their family or go to school.../s
17175,I’m game but it’s a tough ethical/political question whether to re-vax when so many can’t yet get vaxed at all.
17176,"From a system view we’d almost certainly be better off sending vaccinations to e.g., Madagascar but from an individual view boosters could make a big difference."
17177,Israel is already planning to boost its over-60 crowd.
17178,"&gt; Seriously, if vaccines couldn't even end this bullshit because of Delta, then what will?"
17179,"1) We might have been able to avoid the Delta variant (at least until enough people get vaccinated) if more people to COVID-19 precautions seriously, 2) we haven't gotten enough people vaccinated yet."
17180,&gt; COVID cases are going to go up and down until the end of time... (forgive me) just... like... the... flu.
17181,"It was always going to be that way, just a matter of trying to get it to the point where it's less severe."
17182,&gt; Are governments going to make us mask up and mask down over and over again forever?
17183,"We really should have been doing it in the first place, a lot of flu deaths could have been avoided."
17184,Wearing a mask in public every year from about October to March should be *standard.
17185,"*

&gt; It would be a shame if they did, because—sacrilegious, I know—masks are not a zero cost measure."
17186,"**They block communication, impede exercise, and quickly get stuffy in warm weather."
17187,"**

I really don't think it's a huge inconvenience."
17188,Wearing a mask in public is in the same category as wearing a seatbelt in a car.
17189,"&gt; It would be a shame if they did, because—sacrilegious, I know—masks are not a zero cost measure."
17190,"They block communication, impede exercise, and quickly get stuffy in warm weather."

17192,"&gt; The chances of COVID getting eradicated are about the same as me riding a bicycle to Mars;

Technically, that was never the point, like how polio technically still exists, or small pox."
17193,"Herd immunity, in the original sense, is still very powerful."
17194,&gt; at some point we've all got to learn how to live with the virus and return to old normal.
17195,"For a lot of people, ""normal"" wasn't very good in the first place."
17196,"&gt; These measures were supposed to be temporary, not permanent."
17197,"It really depends on which specific measures you're talking about, and who you think gets to define what is ""supposed"" to happen."
17198,"But, if you want to blame anyone, blame the people who never did--and still don't--do what needs to be done to fight the virus: those are the people who are dragging this thing out."
17199,"&gt; because ""the CDC said Delta's making the vaccines almost useless

They did not say that."
17200,Hydroxychloroquine opens the cell so Zinc can get in.
17201,This happened at work the other day.
17202,Woman (co-worker) tells me that her and her husband both over 60 won’t get the vaccine because it will cause sterility.
17203,"I’m just staring blankly, “you plan on having kids?” “No, I can’t I have gone through menopause”."
17204,The look coming from me had to tell her that she may be the dumbest person I’ve ever met.
17205,She changed the subject and quickly left my office.
17206,Their arguments don’t even support common sense and simple logic.
17207,"I’ll be honest, the shit part of my head thinks it’ll be the last festival like that ever."
17208,I’m not having a great day today at all with all the news.
17209,#Well....may I get a 3rd jab....please?
17210,No restrictions other than masking is a huge relief!
17211,Hopefully this wave will be over soon.
17212,The hardest hit places look like they're starting to peak.
17213,You’re conflating two different issues with two different context and nuances.
17214,Imagine how bad things would be without vaccines.
17215,"Oh wait, we don’t have to imagine because India got hit with Delta a couple months ago with only a small percentage of the population vaccinated and estimated deaths were in the millions."
17216,The IOC is not the problem.
17217,IOC could not mandate vaccines because vaccines were unavailable in most parts of the world until just recently.
17218,The US was another story.
17219,Everyone in the US could have had mRNA vaccines no later than April.
17220,There’s no excuse for these athletes not getting them.
17221,We found out yesterday that people who are vaccinated can still have a high viral load with delta.
17222,No way is that an excuse for the failure of the USOC to require vaccination months ago.
17223,Hydroxychloroquine opens the cell so Zinc can get in
17224,This post appears to be about vaccines.

17229,"Wait, sterility!?"
17230,"I asked my gyno to sterilize me five years back, and she was like, ""Let's wait and see if you REEAAALLY want that."""
17231,"(Also, we need approval from your husband UwU.)"
17232,Now more than ever!
17233,I wish the vaccine coulda sterilized me!
17234,"Vote the fucker out,  he’s a craven monster, tbh."
17235,"It’s crazy to read shit he’s done that’s directly affected his constituents and citizens of Texas, just like your story, over and over again."
17236,"You're still less likely to get sick if vaccinated, but if you do, you'll spread it as much."
17237,That's millions of people who still won't get sick in the first place because of the vaccine.
17238,Bingo bingo.
17239,"Fact is that these unvaccinated people don’t have any immunity, and a mask mandate doesn’t change that."
17240,"If this supposed mask mandate comes back, those people who get “saved” by the mask mandate are just going to get infected when the mask mandate inevitably ends when cases lower."
17241,"Nobody seriously thinks that this is a disease that unvaccinated people can permanently avoid, do they?"
17242,"I don’t want to come off as a jerk about this, but the only tangible goal I see left is that under 12s haven’t gotten the chance to get vaccinated."
17243,"But even if they did have the chance, I think this debate would still be happening, and that makes me wonder what people consider what “the end” actually looks like."
17244,Kids need to be able to get the vaccine now.
17245,The FDA holding off on this is going to make fall session a complete utter shit show.
17246,Fully approve for adults and EUA for kids.
17247,Companies should then start requiring the vaccine
17248,Yes.
17249,And there is an special warning against leading other people astray.
17250,Millstones...
17251,"Me, me, me, me."
17252,That's all you're saying.
17253,I can't wait until the vaccines become mandatory in October.
17254,It was the US and I was required to get a meningitis vaccine to get accepted into college.
17255,What you just said was total bullshit
17256,HCQ has been roundly proven completely ineffective.
17257,Get out of here with that.
17258,I’m sure there are plenty of reasons and I am certain someone will list them.
17259,I’m just burned out and don’t have the energy to care anymore.
17260,"After getting severe COVID, losing 3 months of work, losing out on the stimulus checks because I was well employed the year prior to getting sick, and now this $100."
17261,I’m getting that $100.
17262,And a booster in the process.
17263,Why ten years?
17264,"You know most of them only take that long because of funding, right?"
17265,And they had a 17 year head start on this one because it was originally for SARS?
17266,"They’ve been tested enough, and at this point, your choice is vaccine or virus."
17267,"If you’ve chosen virus, go out there and get it already."
17268,Contribute to the herd immunity your way.
17269,I wish you luck.
17270,[removed]
17271,Freedom!!!
17272,…so long as you strictly follow their beliefs and rules.
17273,It’s really “freedom” in name only.
17274,Being on a ventilator staring at the ceiling changes most minds.
17275,In my area four out of five people are NOT vaccinated.
17276,I wear an N95 and avoid everyone.
17277,Tbf the government did kind of say “okay we’re just about good now” a few months ago
17278,It's... Not working.
17279,It depends on the level of exposure.
17280,With Delta we are looking at exposures three orders of magnitude higher.
17281,That's why the CDC changed their guidance.
17282,Fuck 'em.
17283,If they worked in non governmental jobs they'd already be required.
17284,Thanks.
17285,Long-haul Covid is underreported.
17286,With respect to brain fog - have you noticed any improvement with time?
17287,"I mean right this second, is it advised, or are people making appointments for them (outside of some who might be sneaking around the system) ."
17288,I understand this may change before too long.
17289,Jesus.
17290,Feels like it’s two steps forward one step back with the CDC.
17291,It’s difficult to rely on them because it’s starting to feel that it’s worse than what they’re willing to say.
17292,"It was like this last spring, it was softened for us, it’s getting softened for us now."
17293,If this is as transmissible as chicken pox then every public venue will get everyone.
17294,What’s the problem with wearing it when a government agency feels like you need to?
17295,"Not to sound cliche, but it’s a piece of cloth that could have a major impact on other people’s lives."
17296,"And I think today, this was the highest number of new vaccinations in a while."
17297,That's brilliant.
17298,"While reading about all the companies that jumped on the vaccine train yesterday, I couldn’t help but smile."
17299,It’s about time.
17300,Everybody deserves a safe workplace.
17301,Kansan here.
17302,I did my part and got my shots back in april.
17303,Wish more of these idiots would.
17304,"If your an 18 year old freshman, I’d say if nothing’s getting better by the time you have to choose courses for next semester, take a gap year if you can."
17305,Threaten to give their dose to immigrants.

17322,The lack from NY and CA seem to tell that story.
17323,I’m very interested to see if this is seasonal.
17324,If the south starts to peak and decline towards the end of august and the north picks up that leads to some kind of seasonality.
17325,We dont know for sure but it seems delta hits hard and may burn out quickly.
17326,The UK is showing a promising curve downward after this recent delta spike.
17327,[removed]
17328,"&gt; If someone tried to shame me for getting a vaccine, I would kick them out of my life."
17329,"This becomes a problem when you live in a rural shithole and that ""someone"" is everyone."
17330,High vaccination rates and it being summer so more people are outside where the virus has a harder time spreading.
17331,Bullshit from CNN...Bullshit Mountain.
17332,Get vaccinated.
17333,No one is going to care.
17334,&gt;  Seven people were reported hospitalized.
17335,"That &lt;1% which is consistent with, if not less than, other variants."
17336,So even if delta is more infectious it is not more virulent...at least for the vaccinated.
17337,You must have met my Dad
17338,Didn't the head of the CDC say 1 in 10 to 1 in 20 vaccinated are getting covid badly again?
17339,Idk what data but cdc so come on.
17340,We have to lock down the whole country
17341,This.
17342,Also mRNA is baller.
17343,The cell uses it to make the spike protein to help your body build T cells and then it breaks it down just like any other cellular function.
17344,Really amazing.
17345,I can’t wait to see what this does for cancer imagine a mRNA vaccine teaches the body to kill its own cancer.

17364,"I live in an area where a lot of the unvaxed live, and I can tell you this will do essentially nothing to increase vaccinations."
17365,These people have been riled up to the point that they view the COVID vaccine as one of the greatest sins inflicted upon Man.
17366,A hundred million dollars won't get them to go get vaccinated.
17367,It's like if everyone at work got a raise but me despite me having as high or higher evaluations.
17368,"On paper, your right."
17369,Nothing has changed for me.
17370,But I certainly would be upset that they were rewarded when I made the better decision for everyone at the time needed.
17371,"If all those 882 people tested positive and only 7 are in the hospital, sounds like the vaccines are doing their job,  That's 0.79%."
17372,Well.
17373,They are stepping into a power vacuum that has been crested for them and someone has to lead.

17381,What's that?
17382,They just want money?
17383,"I give them a benefit of the doubt, new things are being learned about this every day, and they’re changing their recommendations according to the most current information."
17384,They did us dirty by saying we didn’t need masks if you are vaxxed because everyone took them off despite 30-50% of people not getting the vaccine.
17385,"but keep in mind the CDC is not requiring you to wear a mask, it was always up to local authorities."
17386,Agreed.
17387,A hundred times.
17388,It’s keeping a lot of companies afloat amid some slow slow times in news.
17389,Obviously not downplaying the threat of covid and I know it’s dangerous and we are still not through.
17390,But “we won’t return to normal in my lifetime” is pretty fucking extreme.
17391,"For a second I imagined your brother stuck on an actual boat with his antivaxx, conspiracy theorist wife."

17400,Listen more and stop jumping in the comments pretending you’re smart.
17401,Media hard at work.
17402,Shaming antivaxers and creating more divide.
17403,It’s already been established that no one cares about young kids.
17404,See: flu shot rates and child death due to the flu.
17405,"It’s even more dangerous for kids than COVID, and no one cares."
17406,186 kids died of the flu in 2018.
17407,Get your damn flu shots too people!
17408,Side note: I hope the combo COVID/Flu/RSV annual shot comes to fruition
17409,I mean they're all about their personal freedom so they shouldn't have any issue right?

17420,Not saying it was a good time to have the olympics but I don't think we can pin this on the olympics when there are greater reasons.
17421,Because other people are getting paid for it because they didnt get it (at the time).

17465,Risk is too high to screw with people's health right now
17466,I'm looking at the death and hospitalization charts.
17467,I'm also comparing it to the statistics that show that ~97% of the hospitalizations are unvaccinated and even less lead to death.

17479,Out of ~75 mil
17480,&gt;Cruise lines are an inconsistent mess when it comes to covid requirements.
17481,Really only because they're trying to find a way to do something that fundamentally doesn't make sense right now.
17482,"It's actually very, very, very simple: now is not the time to go on a cruise."
17483,"Yes, that sucks for the people employed in that industry, just as it does for those in a lot of other industries."
17484,But not every industry in which people have found gainful employment *should* exist under arbitrary circumstances.
17485,"The cruise industry is one that already had a lot of strikes against it, from food borne illness, to worker exploitation, to environmental issues."
17486,"Seeing it scaled back to a smaller volume would be painful in the short term, but not a bad thing at all in the long one."
17487,"Fair enough, I missed the mild part but it is not very common with covid at all for people with mild symptoms to have long term symptoms."
17488,It can happen sure but calling it very common is ridiculous.
17489,The articles that came out about that were self surveys where people said they were tired and the media blew it up and said young people with mild covid were all having long covid.
17490,And second or so it morbidly obese ppl.
17491,What a gross ass state as far as people go.
17492,I do bet you’re  an outlier though- fight the good fight haha.
17493,"Yeah, it's just straightforward math that as more people get vaccinated, more breakthrough cases will happen, because the vaccine isn't 100% effective."
17494,"In a population where 100% of people are vaccinated, where the vaccine is 90% effective, 10% of people would still be expected to get the virus if everyone was exposed."

17517,"On the flipside, from the anecdotes I've heard on reddit, even among those who got #rekt by the 2nd shot had minimal side effects from the 3rd shot."
17518,"&gt;As of Thursday, 882 people were tied to the Provincetown outbreak."
17519,"Among those living in Massachusetts, 74% of them were fully immunized, yet officials said the vast majority were also reporting symptoms."
17520,Seven people were reported hospitalized.
17521,"&gt;This is a virus for which 98%-99% of people will have no complications, and the vast majority of people who do have underlying issues."
17522,This is completely untrue.
17523,"We have data that shows that 10-30% of people infected end up with ""long covid,"" in some cases with heart or lung damage that will never go away."
17524,This can happen even if they had only mild infections and even if they were previously completely healthy.
17525,This study is garbage.
17526,That is all
17527,"Should've had an app made in advance for people to show proof of vaccination, add a QR code to scan to get into places requiring proof"
17528,We are 49th in education.
17529,Lol
17530,What you listed are simply the first steps in vaccine requirements.
17531,"If not a federal mandate, the next best thing, business."
17532,It's a drop in the bucket but a drop none the less.
17533,"The bottom line is you need vaccinated people, as high a percentage as possible and then the virus loses its advantage and it has far less chance to mutate."
17534,If you have a raging pandemic and 55% aren't vaccinated and 15% of the vaccinated can maybe get it then you're still in a pandemic.
17535,"Not only that, every single person that gets sick and the virus sees those antibodies give a chance for a mutation."
17536,It's a numbers game.
17537,I know two people like this … they’re both convinced with absolutely no logical evidence that the vaccine has a significant risk of reigniting chronic conditions that they had in the past
17538,My mom told me that the other day that people like me and my fiancee (vaccinated since February) might be making other people sick.
17539,"I just try to keep questioning her until she admits that she doesn't have any real evidence, but I feel like there is some new conspiracy every time."
17540,"Honestly make it a mandatory question to ask if they refused to get the vaccine and if they did, use the resources elsewhere."
17541,So is the Pfizer booster shot just another dose of the vaccine you've already received or is it different?
17542,What would keep people from just going in and getting another shot of Pfizer before the need for a booster was confirmed by the CDC?
17543,I believe so but I think it would be a small subset.
17544,You think you’ll get mask wearing or will everybody not wear them?
17545,How are things in your area?
17546,Also stay safe kids seem to be germ factories s
17547,"There was a nasal vax my husband got for H1N1, so the idea does exist."

17552,"""Yes, we have a health protection agency, the CDC, but when they're most relevant...fuck em, because freedom"""
17553,It'll be ok.  Just pray it away.
17554,Works every time.
17555,Wait...
17556,I disagree.
17557,If you don't get vaccinated you don't go in the grocery store.
17558,Do curbside.
17559,We have to inconvenience people to get them to be vaccinated.
17560,"Not enough people know you’re a douchebag, huh?"
17561,Sounds like you took nursing for attention.
17562,Glad your no longer nursing...we dont want you
17563,They're definitely the vocal minority.
17564,But then it's not like anyone in the UK is going to protest for vaccines considering it's readily available now for everyone 18+.
17565,The vaccinated people will just get their shot and move on witj their lives.
17566,Right so you’re little analogy about the meteor doesnt really make sense then does it?
17567,"We know there are hosts, we know 99% of america is not taking protective measures anymore &amp; we know americans are traveling internationally in far bigger numbers than the last 18 months."
17568,So its not off the table for a mutation to occur here and spread elsewhere.
17569,Im not saying it will end the world or send us into lockdowns but to say there is no chance is naive.
17570,How will that motivate the public when they are not on the job?
17571,If someone walks into a store unmasked - who is going to do the enforcement?
17572,The min wage employee?
17573,Cops don’t respond to mask calls because it is not a crime.
17574,The most you can do is ask them to leave and hope they are not one of those people that are going to shoot you or assault you for asking.
17575,"*Dorothy:* Toto, I have a feeling we're not in Kansas anymore!"
17576,"*Toto*: No, they had to send you to another state because their ICU's are all full."
17577,You should have gotten vaccinated.
17578,"Also, you're hallucinating."
17579,"I wonder how much it would cost to detach Florida from the rest of the US, tow it out into the Caribbean and just let it sink."
17580,I'm thinking we really ought to look into this.
17581,"Very troubling, specially in light of the Israeli study saying vaccines don't protect from Long COVID effects."
17582,Absolutely.
17583,"Symptoms can present in as little as three days, so if the effect of the 19th was going to be that pronounced we'd already be seeing serious rises."
17584,This seems like normal variance on a downward trend so far.
17585,"We need saliva tests to identity the super spreaders, which is a thing."
17586,Where can I sign up to get a booster shot each month?
17587,I need it
17588,"So, just 1950s abortions… And 2030s abortions."
17589,Fcuk this babbling idiot!
17590,I'm retiring and you won't force anyone to get vaccinated.
17591,I see mass lawsuits coming.
17592,Take your needle and shove in up your...
17593,"Nevertheless he is not their ""commander in chief""."
17594,Post Office employees don't face court-martial if he gives one of them an order they refuse.
17595,Carrots haven't been doing it.
17596,We need more sticks.
17597,Hold businesses and non-profits financially responsible for outbreaks if they're found negligent.
17598,Problem solved.
17599,They'll require vaccinations or do anything possible to prevent outbreaks.
17600,"The anti-vaxxed/anti-mask will quickly be unable to do anything outside of their homes holding onto their misguided beliefs, meanwhile the rest of the responsible world keeps moving forward."
17601,"Yeah, I feel you on that."
17602,I think the biggest issue is with the government really underestimating how many people would even want the vaccine and not having an incentive plan in place from the get go.
17603,They assumed the protection would be enough from the beginning.
17604,"But that said, things are the way they are now - and I at least can’t think of too many better ideas that would actually be possible."
17605,Maybe a national registry of vaccination (states would have to submit their own data which would be a mess) and some incentives/bonuses based on that?
17606,I don’t know.
17607,"There were like 6 people admitted to the ICU in the interior, and by all accounts they were unvaccinated."
17608,Rising case numbers don't mean rising ICU numbers because most people are vaccinated.
17609,They told us to get vaccinated and we did that.
17610,They told us we needed to get to 70% of eligible adults with at least one dose and we did that.
17611,Then they moved the goal posts and said 80% and we did that.
17612,Now they don't say anything about herd immunity.
17613,The goalposts keep moving.
17614,Nope.
17615,Look up 'T-cells' and 'polyclonal antibodies'.
17616,"Immune escape can affect the vaccines and natural immune response, but it can't negate them."
17617,Meantime we're working on revised vaccines and already vaccinated people will be being exposed to variant infection at levels that will prime their immune systems.
17618,It's about building a portfolio of immunity over time and in different ways.
17619,Yep the vaccine hesitant crowd definitely seems to be the vocal minority over there when they've managed to get almost 90% adults vaccinated so far.
17620,And this is without qny incentives being offered.
17621,I can see the masks eventually going away being a very gradual thing going forward.
17622,"There won’t be another big CDC announcement whenever it’s deemed safe to take them off, after all the blowback they got for the May guidance."
17623,"What I think will happen is that any enforcement will quietly stop, and people will begin going out like normal again at their own pace."
17624,"Maybe this is pedantic of me, but wanting to be discrete and private is hesitancy, in that, they aren't open and out about it."
17625,"My company didn't make anyone feel weird about taking a day off for it, for instance."

""Natalie Dean, a biostatistician at Emory University, said the data point to two possibilities."
17759,"Either the vaccine’s efficacy against mild disease is decreasing slightly, or the emergence of new viral variants made it look less effective."
17760,"“It’s some kind of modest decline, keeping it all in perspective that this number is still high.” She also emphasized that as more data are collected, the vaccine remains effective at preventing severe disease."""
17761,Because it's a fact.

You probably think it's going to be much higher because the media has been reporting % vaccinated vs % unvaccinated in hospitalized patients, which is not reflective of the efficacy."

18127,Why is this person so downvoted?
18128,And they don't have to believe in it to be on the receiving end of it.
18129,The problem through the entire pandemic has been shortsightedness.
18130,Absolutely great advice here.
18131,"They don't want to wait, that's why."
18132,"Pfizer may develop something better, but the timeline is not clear and the surge is infections is already here (in Israel that is)."
18133,"They trust facebook Karens more than modern medicine, until their oxygen level drops."
18134,"Then, they show up at the hospital for help, instead of their facebook friends who told them not to get the vaccine."

18136,"Oh, Alabama."
18137,The devil fools with the best laid plans.
18138,"&gt;\[The CDC\] must continue to emphasize the proven efficacy of the vaccines at preventing severe illness and death while acknowledging milder breakthrough infections may not be so rare after all, and that vaccinated individuals are transmitting the virus."
18139,I've been saying this for a few weeks now that breakthrough infections are not rare... at all.
18140,"The data from places like Israel supports this, and I personally know four people that were fully vaccinated and still tested positive."
18141,"Public health officials really need to come out and shoot straight with people that the vaccines are doing a great job keeping people out of the hospital, but the new variants + waning immunity means there's still a very, very good chance that given enough time you're going to get COVID."
18142,Pfizer had a bullet point in their most recent Investor Relations presentation that they've completed the first trial batch of delta-specific vaccine and expect to begin clinical testing of it in early August.
18143,"If we want to bring efficacy against symptomatic disease back to where it was originally with OG COVID (the 95%+ studies of late last year), it's pretty much a given we need to approve and disseminate variant-specific boosters."
18144,"Important to note some people are pointing to Repubs not changing tune, it would appear they have on vaccination but not on masks, just to clarify some above misunderstandings."
18145,If you read the actual presentation there’s a heavy emphasis on vaccination effectiveness
18146,People are really spinning themselves out here.
18147,It's not good news but I'm not sure where people are getting the idea that this is a doomsday scenario.
18148,Unless you are under 12 or have certain health conditions…
18149,80% of what you wrote is straight up wrong or disinformation.
18150,The vaccine was by no means “rushed”.
18151,It had more resources thrown at it than probably anything outside of a world war effort.
18152,Millions of people were exposed to the virus through everyday life so data came in faster than for other vaccines that have to wait for enough people to get infected to measure outcomes.
18153,"FDA did review and approve all standard safety clinical trials (3 phases, with longer term monitoring ongoing, which is standard when a new drug or vaccine hits the market)."
18154,"We also now have 16-18 months of COVID data, and 12 months of vaccine data that shows the effects from COVID to be much worse, likely includes many will ne long term, and much more prevalent for health issues and death by far than any of the vaccines (like by a factor of 1000)."
18155,Billions of doses administered.
18156,Over a billion people vaccinated.
18157,What numbers are you waiting for?
18158,Maybe update how you assess risk.
18159,"If they had already approved it, I bet you would complain that they rushed the process."
18160,"Even if that's not you, a lot of people would."
18161,"There is a process that takes time, and they should not rush it."
18162,"In addition, major events being cancelled means a huge amount of money lost for them, their venues, vendors, and host cities hence why big events like Lollapalooza went ahead as scheduled this year and required proof of vaccination or a negative test."
18163,I volunteer for some conventions and there was so much money lost last year due to everything being cancelled.
18164,"Even though insurance covered it with ""an act of god"" clause, I can tell you they were not happy about it and either upped the premium of that rider sky high or made it financially even tougher for events to cancel again."
18165,"This year, the conventions are either requiring proof of vaccination, a negative test and/or masks depending on local guidelines, and unless the local government orders the events to shut down, they're going ahead as scheduled."
18166,Many of them cannot stomach having to cancel yet again and lose yet another huge amount of money unless insurance wants to cover everything again which I'm sure they're going to do their best to avoid.
18167,Can we start  paying  people to  get  the vaccine?
18168,I bet  there's  plenty of  people  who  would  take fifty  bucks to get the  shot
18169,Aren't other countries reporting far less impressive numbers though?
18170,40% of COVID-19 infected people that were admitted to the hospital were double vaccinated.
18171,"https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/60-people-being-admitted-uk-hospitals-had-two-covid-jabs-adviser-2021-07-19/

Either they are using a far inferior vaccine (and Pfizer is far better than we thought) or the US is bsing those numbers."

18184,everyone goes to office and the bars straight after with no regard for the virus and then wonders why its spreading.
18185,I mean of course there might be some foreigners for the olympics who get infected but japan and korea have been on this path with the not based in logic 'social distancing' steps
18186,&gt;  unfair to predict public health policy on worst case hypothetical scenarios.
18187,I concur.
18188,"At the same time, the CDC took the limited data it had and put the best possible construction on it."
18189,So the rebuttal to your point is that it is irresponsible to base public health policy on the rosy scenario.
18190,"Also, I can't ignore the timing of it which was in line with Biden standing on stage declaring that we had turned a corner on the pandemic."
18191,To this outside observer it sure looked like the CDC pushed a hopeful agenda to advance a larger political narrative.

18205,"The agency does not count vaccinated people who have been diagnosed with the disease but are asymptomatic or have only mild symptoms, said Dr. Ashish Jha, dean of Brown University’s School of Public Health."
18206,"That’s problematic, he said, because the way researchers count infections among vaccinated people is vital to investigating this continually evolving virus, he said."""
18207,"So given this information and the fact that it's now confirmed vaccinated individuals can contract and spread Covid to even other vaccinated individuals, how is this the fault of the unvaccinated?"
18208,If all the vaccine is doing is lessening the symptoms of Covid and not actually preventing you from getting infected then it's not the same as the Polio or other standard vaccines.
18209,"&gt;It may lead to holdouts with future vaccines

18215,What do you think the response to losing your job for not getting the vaccine will be?

18289,Do you get upset that all the good parking spots are reserved for the handicapped?
18290,Big government telling people how to run their business?
18291,I'm so confused.
18292,"How about ""extremely tiny chance of significantly harmful side effects from the vaccine"" vs. ""extremely high chance of being protected from the virus that's killed millions of people across the planet""?"
18293,&gt;We can both acknowledge the fact that vaccines work and that vaccinated people can still spread the virus.
18294,People seem to be forgetting that we initially had no idea if the vaccines would cut down on transmission *at all*.
18295,"The goal of the vaccines was never to stop people from getting infected, it was to cut down on serious illness and death."
18296,Roll Tide!
18297,Do you drink and drive too?
18298,Your link shows cases exploding.
18299,"Mandate the vaccine, fuck their feelings."
18300,&gt; Delta's R0 is ten.
18301,That doesn't mean anything*.
18302,"First, I recognize that zero Covid is probably impossible, but that's often meant as trying to clash every possible chance for the virus to transmit."
18303,Allowing some transmission but trying to keep R under 1 is *easier* and it stops the virus anyway eventually.
18304,"R0 tells us so far how the virus is spread, let's remember that now population has some immunity, we have vaccines, we have masks, we have guidance to reduce or prevent aerosol transmission indoor, we can quarantine positives, use tracing apps, etc.."
18305,It is a mystery to me why we shouldn't at least *try* to reduce spread on all fronts till the virus mostly dies by itself.
18306,"Now that the alternatives to lockdowns are many, we can at least borrow some more time either for even better vaccines adapted to variants, or hopefully for treatments for who gets infected or ill, even if ICU do not get at capacity."
18307,"We are risking building a burden of disabilities in the future because apparently acting with reasonability is unbearable, everyday I'm like: ""seriously?"
18308,""", and I get people's frustration with the pandemic, I just don't think that's the healthiest way to cope with it

*: it means something but not everything nor a lot."
18309,Hopefully.
18310,"Forget masks, focus hard on vax, and let’s all move on with our lives."
18311,Also eligible children (12-17) who live with anti-vax parents and would get the shot if they could.
18312,My boyfriend’s nephew is one of these.
18313,"Uhm, no, ""universal masking and that's it"" is not ""what they are asking for""."
18314,What you're quoting as some kind of policy recommendation is just a modelling assumption for the probability model presented on slides 20 and 21.
18315,All they say is that masking is the only non-pharmaceutical intervention they've included in the model.
18316,"A few slides later, under ""Next steps for CDC &gt; Prevention"", it first says ""Universal masking for source control and prevention"" and then *""Reconsider other community mitigation strategies""* (my emphasis), so it's in no way like other NPIs are off the table."
18317,"When the pandemic started they said that usually it takes 2 years for it to ""end"" and they were saying will end in 2 years too."
18318,I thought thats just absurd and thats too damn long.
18319,But now I feel like 2 years is not even achievable and I'd be happy for it to end in 2 years but thats unlikely now.
18320,Yeah if anything this shows you need the vaccine to protect yourself since apparently it doesn't protect those around you all that well.
18321,I thought you meant Georgia the country lol
18322,Hell yeah brother
18323,No.
18324,In the slide this article is referencing they differentiate between all infections and hospitalization effectiveness.
18325,70-85 percent effective against infection and 90 percent against hospitalization
18326,I feel like we're talking past each other so let me reframe my core point.
18327,"Consider the following scenario:

There's a small, unventilated room with 50 people in it, all with confirmed covid 19."
18328,They're coughing and talking and just generally socializing.
18329,I'm going to walk into this room and stay there for 2 hours.
18330,"* If I wear a full P100 face mask + respirator (the kind you might use for mold remediation), barring any equipment failure, I will probably not contract covid 19."
18331,"* If I wear an N95 with a good fit, I might get covid 19."
18332,There's a reasonable chance I'll escape unscathed but it's far from a safe bet.
18333,"* If I wear a cloth mask, I will most likely contract covid."
18334,"* If I wear nothing, I would almost certainly contract covid."
18335,"Now let's change the scenario and imagine that everyone in the room, including me, is wearing a cloth mask."
18336,"There's a decent chance I'll escape without catching covid because everyone's mask is controlling the emission cloud, preventing their droplets from collecting all over the room."
18337,I feel like you and your sources are referring to the second scenario: the effectiveness of cloth masks to control the emission cloud.
18338,"I'm talking about the first scenario because in a post-mask-mandate world with unvaccinated folks running around without masks, that's the scenario we exist in."
18339,The question I feel is left unanswered is: in a scenario with completely uncontrolled emission clouds -- where you are in fact breathing air tainted with all manner of particles -- how effective are cloth masks at stopping those particles from getting into your lungs?

18396,Did you even bother to read my original comment??
18397,Where did I say I refuse to wear a face covering where did I say vaccines shouldn't be mandated??
18398,All I said was it's ridiculous to ask fully vaccinated people to get tested everytime there has been a suspected exposure.
18399,Yes I admit I don't know many immunocompromised people but the ones I do haven't been out of a job.
18400,Maybe I'm just anti social or maybe that's because they're a small part of the population.
18401,"As to your example about handicapped spots, guess who reserved those spots?"
18402,"Your local government, they have a ""program"" to help those people without causing a major inconvenience to others."
18403,Again what you have chosen to ignore in my second comment is that it is the government's responsibility not the people to help the vulnerable.
18404,Getting the vaccine and wearing a mask when necessary is more than enough by the general population.
18405,The approach to covid now is akin to saying every parking spot is a handicapped spot and everybody has compromise for those few.
18406,Also my flu season remark was meant to point out that they get the seasonal flu vaccine to lower the severity of the infection
18407,The thing that gets me is...basically every politician in every major party is saying get it.
18408,"Biden says get it, Trump says get it, Schumer says get it, McConnell says get it, etc etc etc."
18409,So why this resistance?
18410,"I thought Trump was these people's ""God Emperor""."
18411,I used to look back in history and look at the stupid thing they believed in.
18412,Now I just look in my own time line
18413,"No, it isn’t."
18414,None of the news has said that.
18415,Literally zero.
18416,What they have been saying is that the new data suggests vaccinated individuals spread it to a comparable degree as unvaccinated.
18417,The spreadneck name has already been claimed by the fans of Widespread Panic.
18418,Don't put this evil on them.
18419,As someone who works in the medical field nursing facilities are severely understaffed because some nurses do not want to get the vaccine.

18423,Everyone dies eventually.

18425,"Everything I've heard indicates mid-fall approval for the 5-12 age group, winter for 2-5, and early 2022 for kids under 2."
18426,"Meanwhile school starts in a few weeks, and kids will return to in-person learning completely unvaccinated."
18427,So if the guidance is to wear masks and they had to get the news out right away why would they not also move on the third shot guidance.
18428,The longer we delay the worse it gets.
18429,To slow.
18430,Is there a significant difference between Missouri/Mississippi/Alabama/rest of deep south?
18431,"If they’d do fewer tests, they’d have fewer cases."
18432,"(/s, of course)"
18433,Supposedly they're seeing the biggest difference in elderly and immunocompromised people which makes sense when you think about it.
18434,Probably why Israel is trying out third doses for elderly people

18436,"Well, had herd immunity been reached prior to this more infectious variant coming about, it would have worked."
18437,With a more infectious variant the threshold for herd immunity is much higher.
18438,Walgreens says you can get vaccinated without valid ID.
18439,Try it and see how well that goes.
18440,There’s what they say and then what they do.
18441,Sorry to hear.
18442,I believe the “breakthrough” cases refer to when you are hospitalized.
18443,The vaccines were never meant (nor is it possible) to provide 100% sterilizing immunity to completely prevent all infections.
18444,They were just supposed to keep most people out of the hospital.
18445,"\&gt;In the US, we would have saved 500K lives if we had been as successful as SK."
18446,"And all it would have taken was actually keeping our pandemic response team and listening to them, which is what SK did and what the US didn't."

18458,I'm pretty sure the Bible tells us to love our neighbors as ourselves.
18459,This means taking precautions so we don't spread a deadly virus to those that are at risk.
18460,"This whole belief that God will protect them from the virus, or not because maybe it's his will, but need guns to protect themselves from the ""bad"" people is ridiculous."
18461,I'm just confused.
18462,"My faith says that I need to do everything in my power to protect my fellow man and trust that God will protect me in turn, not the other way around."
18463,Probably can't do that until it is fully approved.
18464,Then it would be cool.
18465,Good luck to you as well.

18698,"One friend pointed out that the new mandate took place on Saturday, so we still got a few days to dig out those masks again..."
18699,"But without capacity restrictions or shutting down these venues of entertainment, food, and drink I feel like a mask mandate is pointless."

18708,And your brain.
18709,Hallucinations on mechanical respiration are a THING.
18710,I remember some of mine despite the heavy doses of amnesia drug they had me on.
18711,"(The sedatives didn’t work, neither did the pain meds, so they settled for trying to make me forget what was happening."
18712,That also only sorta worked.)
18713,I would assume it isn’t one variable but a combination of multiple reasons.
18714,Given their long haul I’m glad things are looking up for them.
18715,"This is disheartening news-

""A person working in partnership with the CDC on investigations of the delta variant, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak, said the data came from a July 4 outbreak in Provincetown, Mass."
18716,Genetic analysis of the outbreak showed that people who were vaccinated were transmitting the virus to other vaccinated people.
18717,"The person said the data was “deeply disconcerting” and a “canary in the coal mine” for scientists who had seen the data."""
18718,"You should read the article this thread is about, it doesn’t matter if your friends are vaccinated."
18719,It’s probably almost worse since their symptoms could be mild enough that they don’t realize they have it but are still shedding the virus at the same rate as someone that’s unvaccinated.
18720,I wouldn't say 'complete outlier' when Huntsville has kept Mo Brooks employed for a decade now
18721,Moderne and Pfizer are still a bargain.
18722,This could be humanities biggest achievement to date.
18723,Too bad we have idiots who won’t utilize it.
18724,Spreading this virus would'nt be that much of a problem if people only had mild disease.
18725,Which is exactly what happens when you're vaccinated against it.
18726,So spreading it as an unvaccinated person is as bad as spreading it as a vaccinated person...but getting infected as a vaccinated person is much better.
18727,"Because I would'nt be using ressources from the healthcare system, which is ultimately our goal."
18728,"As Boris Johnson said about removing restrictions...if not now, when?"
18729,Because I can't be the only one who doesn't want to spend the rest of his like living in a society full of lockdowns and curfews.
18730,"Masks aren't that bad to be honest, but all the rest, all the other restrictions, they eventually have to go."

18736,"&gt;With more than 156 million Americans fully vaccinated, nationwide, approximately 153,000 symptomatic breakthrough cases are estimated to have occurred as of last week, representing approximately 0.098% of those fully vaccinated, according to an unpublished internal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention document obtained by ABC News."
18737,"https://abcnews.go.com/US/symptomatic-breakthrough-covid-19-infections-rare-cdc-data/story?id=79048589

0.098% seems pretty rare."
18738,It was moderna and yes both shots.
18739,And I had Covid before when it first hit and was way worse sick
18740,The vaccines aren’t useless.
18741,"They do remain effective … for 75-85% of the vaxxed, meaning about 3 out of 4 or 5 out of 6 will have good outcomes."
18742,"But that leaves 15-25% of the vaxxed, about 1 out of 4 or 6, are at risk for very undesirable outcomes."
18743,Great for the “many” who win this lottery.
18744,Not so great for the “some” who lose.
18745,"Ah, interesting."
18746,Can’t tell if you’re genuinely confused or just trolling
18747,I was in Disneyland on 6/2 and 6/3 and masked the entire time.
18748,"It was fine, honestly, but then again I am an essential worker who has masked 8 hours a day for a year and a half now."
18749,Not sure why this is a dealbreaker for so many people especially when it's just indoors.
18750,"Yes, but in order to transmit it, people have to actually become infected."
18751,And the vaccine provides a high level of protection against becoming infected.
18752,"For this reason, the vast majority of the transmission comes from unvaccinated individuals."
18753,Yup.
18754,[removed]

18759,"Feel free to point out any of those ""yikes"" things from my comment history, since you have so much time on your hands and are so invested in this."
18760,I wasn’t in the South but I got my vaccine from a big box store and they asked for insurance and ID.
18761,My partner got theirs from a city vaccination center and they didn’t ask for either.
18762,I really think more attention should be paid toward how we can get undocumented immigrants vaccinated.
18763,My guess is their rates are extremely low and any population of unvaccinated people is a risk to public health.
18764,"Even if some of them got a slightly inferior vaccine versus delta, the data still shows way too many vaccinated breakthrough infections."
18765,"Yeah, I’ll admit I didn’t think we’d see that (and to be clear, CDC isn’t recommending additional measures beyond masking at this time), but I think with the new data, it’s a bit more likely."
18766,I ate indoors at a restaurant a couple of days ago.

18794,We need to accept that the way forward is to lower the severity of disease and just accept the virus is going to be here to stay.
18795,There are other viruses that were once huge threats and are now just like another common cold to us.
18796,We need to get there with COVID because that is the only likely end to the pandemic.
18797,"I got moderate COVID in NC at around 9% when things started ""reopening"" and that was after first vaccine shots."
18798,I cannot imagine 21%
18799,"Wow, talk about going back on what you said."
18800,If you think masks are going to be effective against a virus with an R0 of 10-12 you’re going to be sorely disappointed.

18807,"https://covid19.who.int/region/euro/country/is

Iceland has one of the highest vaccination rates in the world."
18808,So why is the virus spreading like wildfire there?
18809,How is it even possible?

19006,"Which is why whenever a prominent conservative gets hospitalized with COVID, they suddenly see the light and go on Facebook like, “Lordy be, I had no idea this was real."
19007,"Now that it’s affecting ME, this changes everything."
19008,"Ignore everything I posted for the past 5 months, get the vaccine y’all.”"
19009,Not really.
19010,"That is the ""Bible belt"" in the US."
19011,"The larger metro areas are more progressive, but out in the sticks, people are still very much controlled by conservative churches and racist, sexist ideologies."
19012,So no masks just kick doorknobs?
19013,Totally agree.
19014,CDC policy of a few weeks ago was geared to convincing the unvaccinated to get the shot(s).
19015,There was data from other countries showing how misguided this was.
19016,"Just another misstep in a long, and tragic, line."
19017,This is the way I am interpreting the data coming out so far too.
19018,"Things were looking well for a while before the Delta variant started to rapidly spread, mostly among the unvaccinated."
19019,"It had very good luck in timing with the US mostly going masks off as vaccine uptake ramped up, but unfortunately just not enough people have been vaccinated to help stop it from rapidly spreading."
19020,It's normal for a virus to mutate to become more contagious.
19021,Delta has done that by increasing viral shedding and viral load.
19022,That means that people will be exposed to larger amount of virus at infection and gives the virus a head start against a person's immune system.
19023,The vaccines give people's immune system a head start against the virus.
19024,"Because of the higher viral load, delta may cause more severe infections than previous variants."
19025,"Since Covid-19 has pre-symptomatic spread and a low death rate and billions of potential hosts, there is almost no selective pressure for it to become less deadly over time."
19026,If it does become less deadly it will probably be due to a random mutation.
19027,Anti-vax individuals don’t fly.
19028,They drive to the same vacation spot year after year.
19029,One of them was a friend of mine and he was fully vaccinated.
19030,Healthy guy in his early 40s.
19031,We’re a bit mystified.
19032,Until one of the dumber becomes infected and the virus mutates again.
19033,Then it’s everyone’s problem (again).
19034,"""To accurately calculate the percentage of positive test results, both numerator and denominator data are needed"""
19035,If there's one thing I've learned during this pandemic is that the CDC is a largely incompetent organization.
19036,"There have been decades worth of studies on the long term effects of extended learning loss in children, while long term effects of COVID is still nothing more than speculation."
19037,"It's already pretty close at our local base, the unvax sailors are the ones being ""voluntold"" for extra duty and bonus shifts."
19038,"After the third or fourth Saturday in a row, most get the message."
19039,"Forcing people into an office during a pandemic, vaccinated or not, is still stupid IMO."
19040,Community spread is bad.
19041,We need to avoid gathering for long periods of time in the same space as people.
19042,Just because you don't die doesn't mean you can't get ill and doesn't mean you can't spread the virus.
19043,I got so sick from Covid last year and frankly I don't want it again.
19044,It should be mandated as soon as possible.

19056,"It flies in the face of the data coming out of the UK and Israel, so it's suspect."

19068,Ah.
19069,The best state to watch Darwinism take place.
19070,Not sorry
19071,African Americans are the least vaccinated in the country.
19072,I don't think political orientation is solely in play here in terms of who gets vaccinated and who doesn't.
19073,I am surprised that Washington DC doesn't have a higher vaccination rate.
19074,"DC voted 92% for Joe Biden, yet only 54% are fully vaccinated."
19075,Church and GOP go hand in hand.
19076,"As many people are calling for, let's see the data."
19077,The references I've seen so far are from a rejected paper from India and an outbreak in a single location but those are just rumors mostly coming from the GOP.
19078,The data from the UK is encouraging.
19079,Semi vaccinated population.
19080,"Steep incline of cases, steep decline with very small number of deaths."
19081,I think everyone needs to breathe a little.
19082,I'm extremely curious where this chicken pox comparison came from.
19083,"I’m very pro vaccine and also have a bunch of small children, “mentally killing an entire generation” comes across as hyperbolic and fear mongering."
19084,These type of exaggerations don’t help compel the unvaccinated and simply scare everyone else.
19085,"*Immediately proceeds to give 50,000 more vaccinations*"
19086,Am I wrong to think that this skittish wild animal could only catch COVID from human through unnatural acts?
19087,It was just an example.
19088,"Maybe the lung opacities they see in people who have covid sometimes don't get better and after years of over working, your lungs fail."
19089,There could be so many things we don't know.
19090,They're talking about male infertility
19091,"The worst part is that the access to vaccination is the same everywhere in France, the disparity is not because there is no access, it's because in some regions people just don't want to be vaccinated"
19092,So why did Jesus give man the power to invent and manufacture masks?

19103,I’m definitely glad I got vaccinated and was fortunate enough to receive the antibody infusion.
19104,I don’t know what would’ve happened if the infusion wasn’t available seeing as I was getting worse.

19110,Infect me twi... you can get infected again.
19111,You've got to understand the nature of the virus we're dealing with.
19112,"This is a strain that has thrived, thwarted, threatened the world."
19113,I think you made a mistake.
19114,"For perfect immunity, it goes as I = 100% - 100%/R."
19115,"If R=10 and those vaccinated or infected achieve perfect immunity, then herd immunity is reached at 90%."
19116,All of the data out of England indicates it is far less severe and far less lethal than the wild incarnation.
19117,This is preposterous.
19118,This virus is not physically capable of hiding out in the body like the virus that causes shingles.
19119,Idk why but this broke me.
19120,Like I’ve done everything I’ve supposed to do.
19121,I’ve thrown away a year of my life.
19122,I’ve stayed home.
19123,"I’ve meticulously masked, I got vaccinated back when it wasn’t as rigorously tested."
19124,But still it continues.
19125,"And it’s not like this couldn’t have been prevented, there are people out there that have never followed the best practices, and now I’m paying for it."
19126,I’ll still do what’s right.
19127,But I’m tired.
19128,I’m just tired.
19129,No?
19130,Keep your chin up
19131,&gt;how is this the fault of the unvaccinated?
19132,"No idea, both spread the same and it's not like the whole world is going to be fully vaccinated anytime soon."
19133,That's why I've been super promask for a while because I knew people would fall into a false sense of security.
19134,"But noo, people think covid is over and they can go back to their normal lives when the most contagious variant starts spreading."
19135,I don't know how anyone didn't see this coming
19136,The risk to vaccinated people is still extremely low.
19137,"[We're talking about](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/covid-19/health-departments/breakthrough-cases.html) ~5,600 hospitalizations and ~1,100 deaths among breakthrough patients out of 161 million vaccinated Americans (with there maybe being [153,000 breakthrough cases in total](https://abcnews.go.com/US/symptomatic-breakthrough-covid-19-infections-rare-cdc-data/story?id=79048589)- the article linked in the OP suggests we don't know, but ABC News claims to have gotten its figure from an internal CDC document, so that might be something), and a little more than 25% of each of those were ""reported as asymptomatic or not related to COVID-19""."
19138,Getting vaccinated protects you from the virus to an amazing extent.
19139,"That said, maybe we'll be seeing a higher percentage of breakthrough hospitalizations and deaths as Delta continues to spread?"
19140,Not sure.
19141,"As always, though, the message is that you should really get vaccinated if you haven't already, because it will protect you and help protect others."
19142,And here we are in Texas where it’s fucking illegal to ask a student to wear a mask.
19143,I’m vaccinated and so is just brother going into school but holy fuck your have to be different level of stupid to not mandate masks now in schools.
19144,Good
19145,"You see, when everyone in the same region has a similar genetic mockup, if one person gets sick, then it's likely that they will all get sick as their immune systems are similar and their bodies just so happen to react badly to a specific virus."
19146,"Basically, if you catch it and get sick, expect your brother to get sick if he catches it, because he's also you father... 🎶Sweet home Alabama🎶"
19147,Damn it.
19148,"Of course, purposely exposing oneself is a bad idea, but it seems like a lot of people are going to be exposed to the virus post-vaccination whether they want to or not."
19149,Doctors and nurses for example.
19150,If they keep getting exposed would it be like getting booster shots every week?
19151,[removed]
19152,Good one.
19153,We should just start calling them that.
19154,"Are we all collectively forgetting that vaccines remain extremely effective, even against symptomatic infection?"
19155,Wtf is this doomsday shit about vaccines suddenly not working anymore?
19156,"""if you look, the numbers are very minuscule compared to what it was."
19157,"It's dying out."""
19158,- All hail the very stable genius.
19159,"- June 17, 2020."
19160,It doesn't help now that Canada said mixing mRNA vaccines is totally safe when no other country seems to accept that.
19161,Most people I know ended up mixing so let's cross our fingers and hope Canada's scientists are right.
19162,"Also this article isn't the first to say that vaccinated people can be infected and spread the disease, it's been known from very early on."
19163,"The only claim the vaccines made was that your symptoms will be less severe and prevent hospitalizations, but a lot of the people who don't follow up with the news end up spreading the misinformation that they are supposed to be this magical cure."
19164,If only the unvaxxed were smart enough to care.
19165,Is the test still the nasty nasal probe one?
19166,And regardless of vax?/
19167,[removed]
19168,"&gt; masks are meant to prevent transmission from the wearer, not protection of the wearer from infection."
19169,That is misinformation from early in the pandemic.
19170,Masks have been proven to offer some protection to the people who wear them.
19171,"Tuberville gonna say the opposite, and once again the state will be divided 60/40 Alabama vs Auburn."
19172,"Eh I got covid it was nothing


I'll never get a vax that isn't approved and has legal immunity"
19173,"If you’re not vaccinated, yeah."
19174,So I’ve struggled with some breathing issues over the last year (asthma/allergies not COVID) and I learned stomach down is often used as it places less stress on the lungs and chest but also to keep mucous secretion and liquids from coating lungs
19175,"How can I, a random individual of no particular consequence, help with the vaccination effort even just a little bit?"
19176,"Would be cool to actually do something, but I suppose at this point it's mostly just a matter of convincing anti-vaxxers, and that's a big ask."
19177,"Maybe there are one or two people I know who could be persuaded (provided that they're not diametrically opposed to getting the vaccine and instead just don't want to go to the effort to do it or whatever), but is there anything else I can really do?"
19178,"I am less than honest, how do I procure a third dose?"
19179,"I guess I could refuse to give my id, or travel to another state."
19180,But my name is in the database!
19181,"He’ll have to go back to mask mandates, which really sucks."
19182,He’s handled the pandemic as well as he could’ve.
19183,I think NJ voters are smart enough to realize that considering the ineptitude of other governors.
19184,Can but it’s rare since the viral load is cut down
19185,"Yeah, I've been of the opinion that all the mask mandates were rolled back way prematurely."
19186,Masks are such a minor inconvenience they should have been the absolute last thing to be rolled back.
19187,"Ah yes, the Chucklefuckus Americanus."
19188,I've heard of them.
19189,"This is strangely eerie and similar to the messaging around coronavirus when it first hit, people thought only symptomatic people can spread this, and it wasnt as transmissible."
19190,Now we are hearing vaccinated people can transmit it and spread it well
19191,I feel like this is just a classic natural selection test the universe is giving the world.
19192,"As long as they register for their absentee ballot and vote on time, no one will care."
19193,"/s

Jokes aside, I will actually be surprised if there aren’t a bunch of cases in upcoming elections where people try to vote dead relatives."
19194,kids have to go to work and take care of their kids?
19195,interesting /s
19196,"Equally contagious if sick, and far less likely to get sick."
19197,"Past strains, it was 40-50% less contagious if sick."
19198,"Yea well, during the lockdowns they were doing the same thing to keep things closed."
19199,Unless someone is paying my mortgage and other bills what right do they have to tell me what to do?
19200,"Ah yes, the ""overwhelm the healthcare system"" approach."
19201,I know plenty of Americans living in Canada that did exactly that!
19202,Worse than last winter?
19203,Before we had vaccines?
19204,How so?
19205,These vaccines still have high effectiveness against hospitalizations and death.
19206,Of course with delta being more transmissible I imagine the unvaccinated could cause us to have a worse winter if you are talking about them.
19207,I can see delta burning through the unvaccinated population and unfortunately killing many.
19208,"That is what the CDC says, so take it as you will."
19209,"Further down the page it says

“But, outbreak investigations conducted in the last couple weeks showed vaccinated people who contract the highly contagious Delta variant ""can actually now pass it to somebody else,"" Walensky said.”"
19210,Just came back from bama.
19211,Can confirm.
19212,I have the covid.

19216,I am fully vaccinated since January 2021.
19217,"I caught COVID in Ptown with my first symptoms on about July 18, 2021 (after vaccination)."
19218,No fever.
19219,"Symptoms were cough, congestion, and sneezing for me."
19220,Felt like a mild flu.
19221,Sense of smell is also diminished.
19222,Made it through OK.   My best friend got it too.

19224,He got congestion and sore throat.
19225,I have spoken to the Board of Health and an epidemiologist called me.
19226,I'm at Baptist health converting less used areas to covid ICU wards.
19227,"We are working 7 day weeks, 10 hour shifts."
19228,There's only so much we can do.
19229,"Right, regardless of people's gut feelings the reality is that at the time all the evidence we had pointed to vaccinated individuals being unlikely to be transmitters of covid."
19230,Between high efficacy numbers that prevented initial infection and lower viral loads it appeared they were pretty well insulated.
19231,The situation evolving as delta arrived and we got a better grasp of it does not mean the previous data was wrong or that the decisions driven by it were wrong.
19232,Bare faces everywhere plus tourist season- absolutely terrifying.
19233,"Fair point, I guess it's just hard to understand at this point why people still hesitate or procrastinate to protect their and other's health."
19234,People said that about the original CDC announcement though.
19235,"And in fact, you could argue the CDC got pressured into making that announcement because of that exact mindset."
19236,I see no reason why it can't happen again.
19237,"There's a Chinese saying...""Do not shed a tear until you see the coffin""...basically means these people don't give af until they're about to die"
19238,"In fact, the research was not even geared towards finding it."
19239,"They were developed, trialed, and authorized on the basis of preventing symptoms."
19240,Which they’re still doing quite well (and it sounds like they’re also still preventing transmissions at a significant rate as well).
19241,"""We ain't herd stupidying our way out of this one scooter!"
19242,"Sucks"""
19243,That's misleading when the data shows that just catching a case when you have the vaccine isn't that big of a deal.
19244,This is the way
19245,Take a deep breath.
19246,Delta is not that much more severe than Covid classic.
19247,It is more transmissible but if you're vaccinated you are still very well protected.
19248,The cognitive thing needs a lot more research.
19249,It is very unlikely that a mild case of covid would have a noticeable affect on your cognitive ability.
19250,I am in no way a covid denier but keep in mind that covid has been an absolute boon for media and that alarming articles get clicks.
19251,If you're having trouble coping you may want to try limiting the amount of time you spend reading the news or even going off of it entirely for a period of time.
19252,Keeping us in an anxious state drives readership and sells ads.
19253,"""Although *it's rare*, we believe that at an individual level, vaccinated people may spread the virus.”"
19254,Texas is actually a pay-to-play state.
19255,Things are delegated to the local level unless you pay for a state level law.
19256,"The telco lobby paid for a law that bans towns from developing municipal broadband, yet rural areas, even wealthy suburbs have no or poor broadband internet connectivity."
19257,The oil industry paid for a bill that makes local fracking bans illegal.
19258,Abbott’s anti mask stance is just to please his base and keep him in office until he announces his bid to run for president in 2024.

19314,"A couple of weeks ago, in my state (WA) we hit 6.7% breakthroughs (1/13.1), and as of our weekly report yesterday, it was 12% (1/8.35)."
19315,The Seattle area (King county) had been at 14% a little before that.
19316,"If you have a 100% vaccinated population, you may have very few cases, but 100% of them will be breakthroughs, so a lot of the increase is just because we're a lot more vaxxed up now."
19317,"Anyway, I wouldn't expect that 1/17 to last."
19318,It's tied with MS as far as least full vaccinations.
19319,"Though a higher percentage of Alabamians have had one shot than Louisiana, Wyoming, Idaho, and... Mississippi, which probably makes them the least vaccinated state."
19320,Well they are first in diabetes and heart disease.
19321,"Better yet, make it a federal offense to forge them."
19322,I fucking hate this state
19323,Yup
19324,Exactly what I was thinking
19325,It's not a valid excuse.
19326,The Olympic Games implicitly penalize countries that lack resources.
19327,"Ever notice the shocking lack of athletes from India, Indonesia, Pakistan, Nigeria, and Bangladesh?"
19328,"These are the 2nd, 4th, 5th, 7th, and 8th most populous nations on the planet representing over 2 billion people, yet not one is in the top 20 countries in terms of medals."
19329,New Zealand has over 3x more medals than all of them combined with a 0.2% of their population.
19330,The reason is that these populous countries are poor and lack resources.
19331,"Requiring a vaccination is less onerous than requiring the ability to pay for airfare and accommodations, let alone the facilities to train."
19332,It will also potentially save their lives.
19333,Darwinism!
19334,Just sent this article to a recent University of Tennessee pharmacy school grad who is still unvaccinated.
19335,"Dude is trying to get a hospital pharmacist job, but can’t be bothered to get the jab himself?"
19336,The cognitive dissonance is deep.
19337,I'm curious is that the end of the story?
19338,What does he reply to God ?

19347,Ugh.
19348,I understand that but people in this thread right now believe the vaccines are basically useless against infection.
19349,The data presented today shows that is not true.
19350,People need to hear that right now.

19354,My family paid for 8 months of Universal Studios passes in 2020.
19355,I called the park.
19356,"Told them we weren’t comfortable coming, to please cancel."
19357,"They said, as the park is open, there is no cancellation, only a 2 month extension."

19368,"Life was back, and I had done my vaccinated, stay at home, social distancing part."
19369,"Now masks have been mandated at my work, in Florida."

19387,"With southern states, its a race to the bottom."
19388,"Unless things drastically change, the US is looking at a winter that is at least as bad as last winter."
19389,"Probably worse because delta is really, really not a joke."
19390,"Ugh, I feel sorry for those people."
19391,Makes me wonder how many of these folks got their kids into school given the vaccine requirements long before covid hit

19405,"They relaxed lockdown for eid at a time when festivals of other religion were being cancelled, only for vote bank politics"
19406,I've been specifically advised against a booster too as an immunocompromised person because DIY boosting might exclude me from the medical studies I'm in and those studies may lead to an invite to trials.
19407,"I can shield where I am now, even if it's pretty devastating at times, like my birthday again."
19408,But if I can help be part of making this vaccine better and producing future vaccines (and future cancer treatments even!)

19410,Just today I gave more blood for a study.
19411,All I hear is testing testing testing... well FDA needs to approve Sorrento Therapeutics COVISTIX it’s a game changer and will help save many lives

19417,"Of a twice as infectious variant though, keep in mind."
19418,Efficacy isn't everything.
19419,Still better than Israel's numbers though.
19420,So our Pfizer shots just got downgraded to J&amp;Js basically
19421,Vaccinated people are 17x less likely to get tested for covid when they have a cold.
19422,I'm still worried about longer term problems like shingles.
19423,We have absolutely no fucking idea what might happen 5 or 10 years from now.

19431,"I’m in DC and there’s no word yet if there’s going to be a different plan for us, but there could be."
19432,"Because there's a process involved for that, and they aren't rushing that since we have an actual EUA already in place."
19433,Supposedly Pfizer's should be soon ( Aug-Sep ) with Moderna about a month after.
19434,Don't read anything into it.
19435,All over canada and other countries US isn't the only country
19436,"Get a tiny bit sick from a shot twice, where you know you'll get better."
19437,Then maybe get mildly sick from delta.
19438,"Or risk permanent damage, months of fatigue, and a terrible illness."
19439,I'm surprised people are so bad at assessing risk.
19440,Sooo...bleach wawa up the behind hole?
19441,"This is hugely relevant: 
&gt;NO ADJUSTMENTS FOR OTHER INTERVENTIONS."
19442,"e.g., no distancing, no isolation, no gathering restrictions, etc."
19443,"So they're asking for universal masking until more people catch it naturally or more people get vaccinated, and that's it."
19444,"Masks until the wave is over, and/or vaccines are mandated by employers after full FDA approval, and/or after kids can get vaccinated."
19445,"So masking through the winter, worst case."
19446,"Get the vaccine, wear a mask, and live your life."
19447,That's not at all unreasonable.
19448,[removed]
19449,"But my chances were already insanely low of being hospitalized is what I’m saying for my Age group

And if vaccinated people can still spread it, and delta is insanely contagious, didn’t I just willingly feel super crappy for 2 day’s for no reason?"
19450,Where are you seeing lockdowns?
19451,"Ah yes, **selflessness**, that tried and true American virtue."
19452,"The vaccine drastically reduced the chances of you getting sick

Even if you do get sick again, the vaccine drastically improved the odds that you won't be as sick as if you didn't have it"
19453,"The thing is, getting vaccinated isn't a choice that only effects you."
19454,"As an unvaccinated person, you're potentially spreading the virus and helping to cause mutations (like the delta variant) that have a direct effect on vaccinated people like me."
19455,"The vaccine is effective, but I don't want to be put at risk again because people like you are still spreading a rapidly-mutating virus."
19456,"You have no reason not to get a vaccine, so stop being selfish and help stop the spread of COVID."
19457,It’s Cape Cod so probably skews older and among the first vaccinated.
19458,All this does is confirm that boosters will be needed sooner than many thought because of Delta.
19459,Or politicians.
19460,Okey dokey.
19461,"That's simply not true though lol, that's ridiculous."
19462,"We're 95% less likely to get infected, 97% less likely to be hospitalized, 99% less likely to die if we are hospitalized, yet we *may* be just as infectious."
19463,"Yeah, we *may* live on a flat earth."
19464,It's sensational stuff like this that makes people distrust actual journalism.
19465,I know what you mean.
19466,It's a very nostalgic smell for me.
19467,Takes me back to the days as a kid playing outside all summer long into the evenings and catching the distant scent of a skunk.
19468,This article is talking about COVID making a resurgence in a much more dangerous form that even seems to lower vaccine efficacy when it comes to infections and possibly severe disease (not deaths currently).
19469,[This](https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/ouakuk/covid_may_lead_to_cognitive_decline_research_says/) article says COVID infections of any severity may lead to cognitive issues.
19470,What I am saying is that we may not make it beyond this novel virus reminding us that it is novel.
19471,Your points B and C have largely been debunked.
19472,You are correct.
19473,"Australia reported exposures that were fleeting, we’re talking seconds."
19474,Someone with Covid that is infectious simply needs to breath near you without a mask in and if you’re not protected by an N95 or equivalent you could likely receive an infectious dose.
19475,That is how many viral particles are being shed with this variant.
19476,It’s as infectious as measles.
19477,Anyone with any public health background can tell you how bad that is.
19478,We had a confirmed case of measles in PHX when I worked for the health dept.
19479,Anyone who had been in the buildings that person had entered ANYTIME that day afterward was literally hunted down and made to quarantine.
19480,"It can infect persons who enter a closed, poorly ventilated space HOURS after the infectious person has left."
19481,A brief face to face interaction even outside is sufficient to infect someone.
19482,Mask the hell up people.
19483,N95s.
19484,Ditch those flimsy cloth masks they aren’t going to protect you.
19485,Which antivaxxers are we talking about?
19486,"The actual ones who don't have the vaccine, or the antivaxxers that just want to keep various restrictions and mandates around?"
19487," 
Yeah."
19488,To unvaccinated people.
19489,That's not enforcement then.
19490,Lmfao.
19491,The DO work.
19492,They work tremendously as a matter of fact.
19493,"The big concern right now is that apparently when it comes to the delta variant, the vaccine protects more against hospitalization and death as opposed to actually stopping a case from happening."
19494,This false profit has blood on his hands.
19495,"He calls himself a shepherd of the Lord, yet he leads his flock straight into the flames."
19496,Hell has a special place for him.
19497,orbital vaccine bombardment.

19502,"I'm working an outdoor music festival in Alabama this weekend, and I'm worried about it."
19503,"The venue is an amphitheater, so I suppose it's semi-outdoors, but I can't imagine that masks or vax records will be required, or enforced in any meaningful way."
19504,"I'm fully vaxxed, but have kids at home who aren't old enough."
19505,"I live on the west coast, and will fly home the morning after the show."
19506,"I'll be working on the stage, and plan to wear a surgical mask the whole time I'm around people."
19507,"I won't eat indoors around people who I don't know are vaxxed, I use nasal sanitizing spray at least 4 times a day, b ut I'm still not thrilled about any of this."
19508,"Versus confirmed Delta infections we're seeing -96% hospitalisation in the UK (mix of AZ and Pfizer, albeit with typically 8-12 weeks between doses)."
19509,Agreed.
19510,I lived in the non-touristy side of Orlando up until a month ago.
19511,Everyone was rather conscious of protocol up until the no-mask-if-youre-vaccinated announcement.
19512,"As to be expected, most towns with a major university seem to be more compliant."
19513,"I am now living in Daytona Beach, and boy oh boy it's a different story here."
19514,They are the party of states rights and personal freedoms as long as you strictly follow their guidelines and ideals.
19515,"I guess I should have been more clear in clarifying that the sane people aren't the ones crying about microchips, which is an equivalency I understood from your comment."
19516,"By getting the vaccinations, you are way less likely to have severe symptoms."
19517,"So, while you may get sick if infected with the Delta variant, it is far less likely you will require hospitalization."
19518,"He makes a point

I make a counter-point

you derail with a moving the goalpost fallacy

OMG YOU ARE GASLIGHTING ME HALP"
19519,The irony is I live in Georgia and went to Alabama to get vaccinated since they were begging people to come get it and GA wasn't open for my age group yet.
19520,When I left the site I was walking behind a couple who walked out just before me and they got in a car with Washington plates.
19521,"Not to sure which country you speak of, but there isn't really such a thing, as a mandatory vaccine."
19522,At least not in Canada or the USA.
19523,And I believe the same applies to the U.K.
19524,Although it's obvious that these Vaccines are proving their worth and should be taken by those who are eligible.
19525,It cannot be forced upon an individual.
19526,That's just the simple truth.
19527,There are exemptions.
19528,"You can exempted for religious reason, medical reasons or reason of consciousness."
19529,Not saying its a good thing.
19530,I'm just saying.
19531,"So, I'm afraid to say, it's literally never gonna be the case where there is 100 percent vaccination in those countries."
19532,There will always be pockets of ppl using one of those exemptions to get out of this or any other vaccine they wish to avoid.
19533,"Some might say that's the luxury you have when living in a ""free country"""
19534,"(a) oh, okay

(b) yes, but delta will change this."
19535,Preliminary result from study in Israel suggest so.
19536,"Breakthrough cases will be higher than with the other, common variants."
19537,"Heck, I see the cases high here in my community."
19538,And that will increase breakthrough cases.
19539,"And - as long as we don't have better number on how many of these breakthrough cases really die or are hospitalized, I will err on the side of caution."
19540,The delta variant spike is just starting.
19541,"The 1,000 will change."
19542,"You say fearmongering ... yeah, well, with this again, I will err on the side of caution."
19543,"(c) Yes, but again (1) delta will change that."
19544,(2) kids in school instead of online will change this.
19545,The studies done on kids during the last 1 1/2 years will be obsolete.
19546,"We already see higher hospitalization numbers for kids and they will get even higher, if we ignore the still going pandemic."
19547,It's a fallacy to compare COVID to flu anyway.
19548,"Also, I vaccinate my kid against the flu yearly."
19549,"Which I cannot yet against COVID, sadly."
19550,The kids have done a lot to take care of the older population and had to dial back their live.
19551,"Until they are vaccinated, I think we older ones can do the same courtesy for them and be adult and just be careful a little while longer."
19552,That’s not true.
19553,The olympic standard for the field competitions are actually lower (easier) than the US standard.
19554,"The US standard is what American athletes need to reach in order to be sent to compete in the Olympics on behalf of the US

so it makes sense that a replacement is on the way"
19555,I wasn't a big fan of the mask mandate removal because of it's unenforceability (who is vaccinated and who isn't?
19556,"), but it is surprising, or at least it is unfair to predict public health policy on worst case hypothetical scenarios."
19557,"Admittedly Delta did exist at the time the rule was changed, but research on it was sparse."
19558,It was still novel even in India at the time.
19559,"Early antibody studies showed less evasiveness than Beta, which Pfizer tolerated relatively well, so the assumption was that it shouldn't be that big of a problem."
19560,"We're running into three simultaneous problems: 

* Delta is moderately vaccine evasive (but not hugely) 
* Research is (unsurprisingly) showing that neutralizing antibody levels decline over time and so breakthrough infection (not severe disease) is more likely 
* Delta itself appears to be very effective at creating viral load in the right places to spread (hence the higher R0 level) irrespective of vaccination status 

Any of those three things break the chain: if one and two weren't the case, people still wouldn't get infected."
19561,"If three wasn't the case, then vaccinated people wouldn't be a big source of spread."
19562,The FDA authorizing a booster would solve the problem of (1) and (2) - at least for another 4-6 months.
19563,"If there is no / limited infection, there is no chance to become a spreader."
19564,In ten to 20 years?
19565,Indian government* thanks.
19566,You can't blame an entire country's people who have no power to procure the vaccines they need.
19567,The worst thing about the pandemic was finding out just how much some people act like they're gleeful about hurting or killing other people.
19568,"There's no freedom in infecting other people with a deadly virus, that's just pointless cruelty."
19569,What in the dadgum
19570,"""The vaccine doens't protect you from getting covid, all it does is lessen your symptoms"" WELL THATS ALL THE MORE FUCKING REASON TO GET THE FUCKING SHOT, RIGHT?!"
19571,"Sorry for all my yelling today, I'm just frustrated at all these anti-vaxxers making the covid situation worse, and I'm just done."
19572,&gt; mask mandates might be a thing again.
19573,Only in places like California and New York.
19574,"They're never coming back in Florida, Alabama, or Texas."
19575,It's now a test of will against the virus.
19576,You don’t need severe disease to get long covid.
19577,I’d rather my wife and I not lose our jobs and/or have long-term disabilities.
19578,I do think this will be a wake up call for some.
19579,Not enough most likely.
19580,Fuckin' idiots.
19581,"No, it's about 3% of those hospitalized."
19582,"It's still overwhelmingly unvaccinated people, obviously."
19583,"But 1000 is not ""pretty much none"" of the hospitalizations, which was what the parent commentor was getting at."
19584,He/she was implying that the numbers were close to zero.
19585,I'm saying that it's not close to zero but it's still &lt;4% of the hospitalizations.
19586,I’m thinking of going in for a third.
19587,[removed]
19588,I didn't say it to be funny.
19589,"I get what they're saying, but my point is the reality of the situation is that what we think ""sane people"" will do and what they actually end up doing rarely to tend to fall in line anymore."
19590,"I agree that most people who already got vaccinated MAY NOT wait for compensation in a future event, but the fact that there still a large number of people out there that think this whole this is scam to put a tracking device in them proves to me that hope isn't a very reliable crutch anymore."
19591,How very christian of him
19592,"The original objective wasn't to stop or slow transmission, but to reduce serious illness."
19593,and death.
19594,"Honestly, how much lower could they really go?"
19595,This is the briefing that the corporate executives who hold the donation purse springs got.
19596,Who then threatened the GOP politicians with pulling their donations if they didn't push for vaccination efforts.
19597,With mid terms coming up and Trump siphoning money off for his election disputes the GOP desperately needs that money for campaigning in 2023 if they want to attempt to get a majority somewhere.
19598,Not to mention GOP voters are more vulnerable to the latest strains because they are winningly stuck in an information echo chamber that tells them not to believe experts.
19599,That’s not an established tendency.
19600,The only thing that is established is that a virus will become more transmissible because of evolutionary pressure.
19601,Everything else is gravy for it.
19602,[removed]
19603,This just in:  Anti-vaxxers much more likely to be premature ejaculators.
19604,It only spreads in this one place that I never go to!
19605,This just in:  Anti-vaxxers much more likely to be premature ejaculators.
19606,"Article says 94%, but it wasn't a huge sample size."
19607,"&gt;Of the 271 total COVID patients in the surveyed ICUs, 255 patients, or approximately 94%, were unvaccinated against COVID-19 in ABC News' snapshot in time."
19608,LOL PERMANENT bahahahahahahhaha
19609,"""Don't blame the virus"" as in it's a force of nature, ""it do what it do,"" don't ""blame"" a grizzly bear for behaving like a grizzly bear, etc."
19610,It all depends on people getting vaccinated and taking sensible precautions if they are in an area with case surges.
19611,Probably the best thing you can you as a young person is to convince people your age to get vaccinated.
19612,Why let the boomers outdo your generation on vaccinations?
19613,"You’re supposed to be better than them, right?"
19614,"Funny how the tone changed from ""STAY THE FUCK HOME"" to ""FUCK THAT I'M GONNA LIVE MY LIFE!"""
19615,"You’re entitled to your opinion, but there’s so much double standard going on."
19616,"If you want to think that everyone deserves to have their loans paid off, then you can’t be mad that people who waited to get the vaccine are compensated."
19617,"There are people who work their ass off and live well below their means to pay off student loans, and others who wait may/may not have them forgiven once specific policies are put into place."
19618,"Likewise, the people who say “you’re not being forced to have the vaccine - just quit your job!” Are the same people who claim that underpaid people have no choice but to stay, can’t leave, are forced to take the lower wage, and that’s why the government needs to enforce a living wage instead of the free market doing its work."
19619,"Doesn’t work like that, does it?"
19620,"What if I said “hey, so and so you have perform this act that makes you uncomfortable if you want to keep your job”?"

19770,Look up the base rate fallacy.

19798,Bound to happen when people generalize though I suppose.
19799,what are you seeing in kids with the Delta variant?
19800,"I know generally speaking, at least for OG virus, children weren't showing many symptoms and thankfully it wasn't as fatal as it was with adults."
19801,is the Delta variant similar in that way?
19802,"unrelated, how does Bobby's ass taste?"
19803,I've always wondered...
19804,I think in a perfect world where everyone agreed to be vaccinated this would be true.
19805,The unfortunate truth is in some places vaccination rates are incredibly low and putting everyone at risk including those with the vaccine.
19806,Sure the risk is very very low for those who are vaccinated but its still a risk.
19807,Its sad because in places in Canada where vaccination rates are very high (80% first dose and 65%-70% second dose) you can see not only hospitalization rates dropping dramatically but total cases as well.
19808,Florida has 66 new cases per 100k people.
19809,California has 20 new cases per 100k.
19810,California could get to Florida levels but they are probably won't since they are better vaccinated and at least attempting to take precautions.
19811,It's a Christian camp apparently.
19812,I remember reading about all the summer camps that were open in 2020.
19813,Deniers acted like very few cases were proof schools would be safe.
19814,Turns out most of the examples they gave went to extreme measures to keep kids locked into small groups the whole summer.
19815,No interaction with kids outside those groups.
19816,"Not today, not tomorrow, these 8 kids are your summer camp buddies for the whole summer."
19817,And masks.

19826,This is great news!
19827,On J&amp;J: we actually don’t have too much data on J&amp;J and delta right now.
19828,However they did say recently that havent found anyone yet who died of covid who got J&amp;J. Im sure it has happened and the data hasnt been released yet but they seem to think the vaccine is holding up quite well.
19829,There was data stating 33% and 90% against Delta so the jury is still out on how effective J&amp;J is against delta and for the long run.
19830,"Anecdotally i caught covid after being fully vaccinated with J&amp;J back in late april, got the vaccine mid march."
19831,Your same line of thinking led to the Holocaust and numerous other atrocities.

19842,There was all the evidence of its effectiveness and the desperation of the 3rd world to get them.
19843,Actions have consequences
19844,"Tell me about it... and can we, at some point, get clear numbers every day (I'll settle for every week) on the number of breakthrough infections that lead to hospitalization versus the total number vaccinated?"
19845,"I do think there was some merit to tracking that number (maybe not in a vacuum like the CDC has been, but it's what I would have paid more attention to) and wish I could see it updated daily."
19846,"But I'm not holding my breath that we'll get granular data on this now the CDC is under fire for not recommending that every American get tested constantly if they've been around someone with COVID (which, let's face it, if you leave your house and don't live in Vermont, is probably multiple times per day)."
19847,"Right now, I can't really focus on COVID positive cases or I'll go insane."
19848,"We all are, I mean look around this sub."
19849,It would be far more useful for me to know two things in my state and country 1) How many breakthrough infections lead to hospitalization?
19850,2) How many children under 12 have been hospitalized with infection?
19851,"Also, plotting the children under 12 infections on a graph starting in April 2020 or so would be wonderfully helpful."
19852,(I don't expect any of this to happen anytime soon.)
19853,"With all of this new data about spread of Delta among the vaccinated, is this the case of only symptomatic breakthrough infections?"
19854,Or can asymptomatic breakthrough infections also spread?
19855,there were fewer people back then though.
19856,"as a percentage of the population, 3% of the world died in WW2, a far cry from COVID at about .05%."
19857,"Does it define what ""long covid"" actually is?"

19917,"So dramatic, were you protesting outside of schools pre-covid demanding that they mandate the flu vaccine?"
19918,Like 10 people live in ND.
19919,And NJ is ranked like 38 for daily new cases per capita so I'm not sure what you're talking about.
19920,I love me some Bayesian statistics.
19921,"Sadly all these articles that report p(vaccination|hospitalized) make people think that the number is actually p(hospitalized|vaccination), and even if they don't think that, the first number is just hard to interpret without p(vaccination)."
19922,[deleted]
19923,Reportedly quite a few doses are about to expire in the US and there is no immediate intention for them to be exported to low-income countries.
19924,I'd rather them be used than be wasted.
19925,I think specifying this pertains to the delta variant is rather important for context
19926,Wth is geass?
19927,Yeah I'm not getting the vaccine
19928,All this “research wait and see” talk sounds like my kid saying “I’m GOING to clean my room/brush my teeth/take a bath!!
19929,!”
19930,I just found out the other day that Bezos bought Washington Post in 2013.
19931,And this article is the first I've seen questioning the efficacy of vaccines.
19932,Brought to you by the news agency owned by the man with the most wealth to gain if we all stay inside afraid and order everything online.
19933,"A number of countries are even doing mixed vaccines where you get Pfizer for the first and Moderna for the second, for example."
19934,"Pfizer and Moderna offer a lot more protection than the other vaccines, so I’d like to see a program to get you guys a dose of the good stuff."
19935,"Admittedly, J&amp;J didn’t seem like a bad idea at the time."
19936,It’s just that Delta really messed things up.
19937,"[https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/ououoy/cdc\_study\_shows\_threefourths\_of\_people\_infected/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/ououoy/cdc_study_shows_threefourths_of_people_infected/)

Time to apologize."
19938,How is that your takeaway?
19939,This study was based on people that sought out COVID testing.
19940,By definition you are biasing the sample towards people with breakthrough infections.
19941,We cannot take ANYTHING about the rate of breakthrough away from this study.
19942,The only way to make such conclusions is through randomized testing.
19943,"So, it's a couple and a family."
19944,[removed]
19945,Honestly I think if Delta had made landfall in pre-vaccine times that there's a good chance the US would have completely collapsed.
19946,It's going to be a wild wild winter among the unvaccinated.
19947,"Ben Shapiro, Sean Hannity, Mitch McConnell, Steve Scalise, and to some extent Donald Trump have all made marked rhetorical shifts this past week regarding vaccines."
19948,Shapiro for example revealed that he is in fact vaccinated.
19949,Don’t feel like finding links right now but you should be able to find examples googling those names.
19950,The fact that it all came around the same time led some to speculate that gop “marching orders” may have come down
19951,I'm waiting for someone to make a graph linking education rate to covid infection rate...

19959,Feeling the same dread as last fall.
19960,This was supposed to be over.
19961,Got mine just worried about those that cannot not those that will not
19962,Hmmm but is it time really?
19963,I say let's take another 18vmonths
19964,Where can I find the presentation?
19965,"Overwhelming ignorance, deliberate when you look at schools that have huge drop out rates, can barely afford books."
19966,Basically anyone not rich is at a huge disadvantage.
19967,Critical thinking has become privatized and sold for a premium.
19968,I got vaxxed at a state site and they asked for ID.
19969,This was back when they had a reservation system though so it was probably to check that you really were who you said you were.
19970,"But .... we have no idea if people can get long Covid from infections, even asymptomatic infections."
19971,We need that data just like we needed the data about whether vaccinated can transmit - and now we are seeing they can.
19972,Plus there are huge amounts of people who cannot get vaccinated -- children and others who are vulnerable  -- and this is a real issue and can be more than a common cold.
19973,Plus Delta is hugely transmissible.
19974,Here's to more people getting vaccinated who can.
19975,And people need to mask up.
19976,"""""The agency’s data suggest that people with weak immune systems should wear masks even in places that do not have high transmission of the virus."
19977,"So should vaccinated Americans who are in contact with young children, older adults, or otherwise vulnerable people."""""
19978,Starting to hunker down again and socially distance again.
19979,We need to start staying home again even if vaccinated so we can stop the spread.
19980,I've returned to masking up and staying home and cancelling gatherings.
19981,Think of vaccine efficacy like entering a lottery.
19982,"A 5% chance of infection is *per exposure*  

The more lottery tickets you buy the more your chance of winning."
19983,People who went back to a normal life with regular contact with tons of people are buying lots of chances of winning.
19984,Basic probability.
19985,Just remember if your over 85 with preexisting conditions maybe avoid that cruise this year.
19986,Congratulations 'Bama y'all finally beat Mississippi.
19987,To the bottom.
19988,Roll Tide!
19989,Yup.
19990,"&gt;When experts or agencies deliver information to the public that they consider possibly or definitively false to further a larger, often well-meaning agenda, they are telling what is called a noble lie."
19991,"Although the teller’s intentions may be pure—for example, a feeling of urgency that behavioral change is needed among the lay public—the consequences can undermine not only those intentions but also public trust in experts and science."
19992,"During the first year of COVID-19, leaders were faced with an unknown disease amid a politically sensitive election in the era of social media, and the preconditions for noble lies became especially fertile."
19993,This article makes a lot of points I have made in the past about Fauci's behavior.
19994,"In my opinion, in response to the right's reaction to him, the left has made him immune from criticism."
19995,I hope people are able to read this and avoid knee jerk defenses of Facui and instead focus on the larger point.
19996,Why in the hell do unvaccinated people get to take priority over any other procedures??
19997,At this point I don't care if it's something as elective as a nose job; the unvaccinated need to go to the back of the last line.
19998,Think of vaccine efficacy like entering a lottery.
19999,"A 5% chance of infection is *per exposure*

20006,Ain't like any of these fuckers have any money to go after anyways.
20007,This is in addition to requiring masks and six feet of social distancing.
20008,Students and even staff might question the point of vaccines if these restrictions are still in place.
20009,Who knows when these policies will spread to colleges and universities.
20010,Creeeeaaaap.
20011,I love smack dab in the middle of this mess and just went back to working in restaurants.
20012,Im vaccinated and chose to still wear a mask just cause Ive enjoyed not being sick over all.
20013,Had a table tonight argue over the vaccination issue.
20014,Made me want to wash my hands even more than usual.
20015,I don't live in fear because of covid.
20016,It is more of me preferring to wear a seat belt while driving kinda situation.
20017,But when I hear people spout reckless nonsense it just makes me sad they can be so wreckless.
20018,It is getting less lethal.
20019,"Look at the data coming out of England, who is way ahead of us in their Delta wave."
20020,They have pinned the CFR at 0.02% \~ 0.03%.

20027,Downvote me all you want.
20028,You people are morons lol.
20029,Guess what you can still get sick from delta and spread it even when you are vaccinated
20030,That’s not how vaccines work.
20031,There’s no requirement to have 100% efficacy to be called a vaccine.
20032,"Flu vaccines similarly don’t prevent all flu infections, but do seem to lower your risk of severe disease."
20033,Alabama is finally first at something!
20034,That's usually a bomb threat.
20035,"Would think ""drive by status"" would be more appropriate."
20036,Same situation here been vaxxed since March (essential worker) and my wife and I are biting our nails until the young children vaccine is approved because our daughter is about to start preschool.
20037,"Meanwhile my boss is all like ""I'm not vaccinated and I don't wear a mask and you ain't gonna get covid from me!"""
20038,It feels worse now than a year ago when at least then I could tell people left and right to put on a fucking mask with glee.
20039,This report all but suggests vaccines don't even matter that much without tests since vaccinated people can still transmit easily.
20040,The viral load overwhelms the vaccines easily.
20041,Covid's not over.
20042,We're over.
20043,Why?
20044,If vaccinated people are not at high risk why should others not be allowed to make their own choices with their bodies?
20045,"Because the whole world is not going to be vaccinated, the virus is not going away."
20046,"It’s not helping the situation, would you agree?"
20047,How is allowing untold thousands of unvaccinated migrants into the country helping the vaccination program?
20048,Let all those dumbasses die.
20049,No medical care should be given to non vaccinated people.
20050,So we need a booster shot at 5-6 month intervals.
20051,If they are unvaccinated people ok so sorry
20052,"Again that is not an accurate, the whole population is not exposed at once."
20053,Why would you down vote this?
20054,It is true.

20071,They also tend to die quicker.
20072,"HOWEVER, in many states, including the one I live in (PA), the government allows insurance companies to charge extra for smokers."

20087,Or you’re happy to answer any concerns I might have or what?
20088,Someone has calls on SRNE
20089,The problem is everyone is focusing on the south and anti vaxxers when we have very large portions of the population in cities in the north that are extremely blue that are not getting vaccinated.
20090,"There are no leaders speaking at events, there are no big outreach programs, everyone just things everyone not vaccinated is a anti masker nut but it's simply not true up here."
20091,It's so agitating.
20092,"Newark NJ (most populated city in NJ) has 280k people, 43% vaccination rate (including kids I get some can't be vaccinated but I don't have the time to break it all down)."
20093,Why is no one paying attention to this
20094,That’s right.
20095,My cat would never do this.
20096,That is high quality and accurate information.
20097,CNN is a propaganda machine and no better than this bot.
20098,Why not tell the truth?
20099,"So are you for or against having mandatory vaccination for the thousands of unvaccinated, unemployed foreign nationals who enter the country illegally each day?"
20100,"Well, when we have over 2k new cases a day, and 1 in 5 of those is a vaccinated person, schools starting up is just going to make the spike worse."
20101,Yep.
20102,There are companies that straight up ban smokers due to the premiums.
20103,Reynolds and Reynolds for example will absolutely *not* consider you if you're a smoker and happily terminate you if you pop for nicotine on a drug test.
20104,no shit.

20350,Instead we should have been aggressively containing community spread of the delta variant.
20351,And we probably should have kept the masks on once it started becoming prevalent in our country.

20353,I was on here every day parroting what others were saying that the news was making a big deal over nothing and we don’t have to change what we’re doing… because the people saying that are people that I trusted a lot and listened to all pandemic long.

20359,This is pure paranoia
20360,Most people knew that being vaccinated doesn't mean you can't catch it.
20361,Especially Delta.
20362,People who have been vaccinated have argued that this is the point at which it is time to get back to normal life based on their own risk analysis.
20363,I don't think this report changes that for most people.
20364,The odds of being hospitalized or dying are still very low.

20382,"But even if they were available, as in approved, I don’t know that I would’ve been able to get one (we lived in a forgotten corner of Indiana, my father made poverty wages, and my mother stayed home with us."
20383,We couldn’t have afforded a doctor).
20384,And that's on average.
20385,"It doesn't mean that &lt;10% of the people dying from covid are vaccinated though, as some here interpret it to mean."
20386,"Between February and July in the UK, around 60% of the covid deaths were from vaccinated people."
20387,"also  more hospitalisations coming from vaccinated people too, as expected."
20388,Do you just parrot everything the cdc says?
20389,Because the “pandemic of the unvaccinated” is also bullshit.
20390,It’s a low risk until you have a heart attack and the hospital is full of COVID patients and you can’t get ambulance.

20520,Iowa just stopped testing.
20521,So we probably outpace Alabama.
20522,Y’all gonna be saying keep being patient forever at this rate.
20523,Totally an empty promise now.
20524,"Agreed, it’s so damn weird."
20525,"So, the title has been updated on the source and the current title is probably more true than whatever this original title was."
20526,"Indeed many people “are on Facebook”, and a large majority of them aren’t antivaxxers."
20527,But they are also maybe not using Facebook so much.
20528,"The new title is:
# Facebook News Consumers Are More Anti-Vaccine Than Fox News Viewers, Study Find

And this I can believe."
20529,"I hope so, but let’s be real."
20530,"How many times were we told “just two more weeks, just another month, we just need to flatten the curve!”?"
20531,"If hospitals are filling up now, in mid summer, when 70% of people are vaccinated, I don’t see how more restrictions don’t get attempted in the fall and winter when this spirals further."
20532,"I’ll deal with wearing a mask longer, but I don’t support heavier restrictions on gatherings and work, and its almost certainly going to come to that point."
20533,"Ontario signed a document a few months ago that allowed doctors to not treat those with a lower chance of survival, to keep ICUs from overloading."
20534,I'm guessing that's the rationing  they are referring to.
20535,Ontario had also cancelled all elective surgeries.
20536,Those for may are only just getting their surgeries now.

20538,The Provincetown scare mongering on Reddit has been hilarious.
20539,It's like people are so sheltered that they don't understand that there are week long parties where men have gay sex while barely knowing one another.
20540,"Like yeah, if you are taking cum from other men and having anal sex you might catch something."
20541,Crazy thought.
20542,Makes sense as fox is a single entity where Facebook breeds entire groups of the fanta menace cults.
20543,"Because I'm considering doing this myself, did you just walk in with your existing vaccine card and just ask them to give you another shot?"
20544,Or did you have to pretend you hadn't gotten it yet?
20545,"Also, notice any side effects in the last couple days after the shot (I felt flu-ish for about half a day after my second, but my girlfriend felt crappy for several days)?"
20546,Case positivity rate
20547,This sub is very bipolar.
20548,"Several days ago, we had people saying that they will never wear a mask again now that they are vaccinated, now I see in several threads people are implying that we need lockdowns again to control the delta variant."
20549,Lol.
20550,"GOP: ""We hate apples""."
20551,"Rational observer: ""You force apples on businesses if it spreads COVID...""

20553,"I haven’t paid any mind - other than to say, huh, they are finally acknowledging this - to what the CDC has said since March 2020."
20554,"They have consistently been wrong / misinformed at best, and downright untrustworthy at worst."
20555,I can’t imagine anything other than a full management purge that could get this organization back to the standing that it once held.
20556,Anyone who has been reading the raw data over the past two months for the US and making any level of actual critical analysis will have known what this report from the CDC has found.
20557,"Many others on this sub and other related subs have seen anecdotal trends backing up what this report shows, but of course everyone likes to ignore anecdotal evidence despite it being one of the best tools we have had through the past two years."
20558,Am I smug that I was right?
20559,You bet I am and I’m sure I’ll get the same hate that I did when pointing out the skyrocketing infection rate growth we started to witness weeks ago.
20560,"Good luck out there everyone; keep  your mask handy, limit unnecessary public interactions, and jump at the chance to take any vaccine that you are allowed to."

20563,Facebook is silently attempting to cull the idiots.
20564,We get out of this shit by the virus mutating to become highly infectious but not nearly as deadly.
20565,Viruses want to keep their host alive because a host dying means that the virus is killed off.
20566,COVID will eventually mutate just like the flu did and become not nearly as deadly.
20567,Or just tell the truth.
20568,I read this as a Bo Burnham song.
20569,"If you're in the states and you want to voluntarily get a 3rd vaccine, demand has dropped off enough that I'd say you should just go for it."
20570,I'm seriously considering doing so myself.
20571,You can try working out!
20572,It’ll help prevent further complications or even death in the case you contract the virus.
20573,"I’ve heard stories, which were confirmed that Albertans stopped wearing masks."
20574,It’s insane
20575,Oh for sure.
20576,"That’s why I almost never went anywhere and mask everywhere when I do have to go somewhere, and will continue to do so after both shots."
20577,"It’s not just epilepsy I was concerned with though, but I rather not talk about my other condition."
20578,That’s between my cardiologist and I.
20579,&gt;Professor Geoff Faulkner from the Queensland Brain Institute is refuting claims that COVID-19 can enter a person’s DNA.
20580,&gt;He says that claims have led to “scaremongering” and people should not hesitate to be vaccinated.
20581,"&gt;Professor Faulkner team’s research published in Cell Reports showed there was no evidence of COVID-19 – or the Pfizer or AstraZeneca vaccines – entering DNA




So the professor from the Queensland Brain Institute did his research."
20582,Put so many restrictions on the unvaccinated that it ruins your life to not take the vaccine.
20583,"I’m talking no jab, no school."
20584,"No jab, no job."
20585,"No jab, no government benefits."
20586,"No jab, no international travel."
20587,"No jab, no entry into government buildings like courts or the DMV."
20588,Texas gonna Texas...
20589,Insurance companies should jack up their rates in states like Florida.
20590,Everyone's premiums will be going up due to anti-maskers and anti-vaxxers and the state governments that support them.
20591,[removed]
20592,"The study says it’s not Facebook users overall, but those who get their COVID-related news from Facebook."
20593,Metropolitan Statistical Area....?
20594,"Yeah, it's amazing how few people don't read beyond the headline and see 80% and think it's total population."
20595,Unless they change the age barrier it's 64% of total population which is definitely achievable in Australia although it will take a while.
20596,Yeah.
20597,Cool.
20598,🙄
20599,People in this sub are rock hard for permanent lockdowns and masking forever.
20600,There is zero concept of risk calculations or acceptance.
20601,ABSOLUTELY insane.
20602,I’m sure there are not many parents in here either.
20603,"The above statement is of course privileged to be a parent of two typical young kids without any immunodeficiency issues, I understand that."
20604,"But i want to be able to make risk decisions myself, not have zero COVID type health directives that take the choice away from me and my family."
20605,In the UK we have been trying to test any positve sample against the major mutations withing 24 hours - and all samples have to go away for Whole Genome Sequencing.
20606,"Since the latest upsurge in cases since May, &gt;95% of all positives are Delta."
20607,The United States in a nut shell
20608,I’m sure some people can have a breakthrough seizure after a vaccine.
20609,But what definitely causes a breakthrough seizure: getting covid
20610,High republican and black population.
20611,Two groups with very low vaccination rates.
20612,What's the alternative?
20613,"People just aren't going to stay isolating, so there is little choice but to officially open up."
20614,"The ""step in line"" is more apt for telling people to keep lockdowns."
20615,You are leaving out the part where they estimate the vaccine to be 75-85% effective at preventing infection.
20616,So the vaccines still work to stop the spread.
20617,They didn't say it because the Cape only has people and businesses between Memorial day and Labor day.
20618,"🤣 I'm fucking dead thank you 

The original from GWB is prob my fave presidential quote ever"
20619,"This, and also, the unvaccinated are variant factories."
20620,How long after Delta until a new one that has kids in its sights comes along.
20621,Could there be a new variant in Indonesia?
20622,"We have the same cocktail we've seen in India a few months ago: Sudden surge of cases, more than 30% of positivity rate, overpopulated and crowded country with lots of poverty which makes lockdowns difficult to implement."
20623,Yep.
20624,"And then the CDC came out and said remove your mask and go back to the mall, restaurants and movie theaters."
20625,And we did.
20626,"Just remember, more people have gotten the vaccine at this point than have gotten covid."
20627,"And covid has killed over 600,000 people in the US."
20628,The vaccine?
20629,Less then 10.
20630,You’re literally a million times more likely to have a bad outcome with covid than by getting vaccinated.
20631,Yep and you can add getting shingles later in life too 😞
20632,It doesn’t help that some people in an epilepsy group I’m in were having breakthrough seizures after getting it.
20633,I did as well last night.
20634,Nothing too serious though
20635,Oof.

20644,Technology has brought us globalization and the potential for rapid spread of pathogens.
20645,It's also beginning to deliver the tools to fight these threats.
20646,We need to get much better at responding globally as we're all in this same shrinking boat.
20647,"I'm hoping this pandemic, should we manage it, will be a wakeup call to see that our future security depends on collective efforts, not petty nationalism."
20648,"Epidemiologists have been warning us for decades (as have climate scientists, etc), we are being tested and will be tested more severely to come."
20649,"Having driven all around the SW these last couple of weeks, I can definitely say people in New Mexico are taking this the most seriously."
20650,Many are still wearing masks indoors.
20651,Good job NM!
20652,You can definitely see it in the CDC county case rate map.
20653,Its like a man learning what these numbers mean for the first time is proud of himself for thinking he made an intelligent argument.
20654,Masks dont block the virus perfectly.
20655,They catch droplets which carry the virus and reduce total amount that goes out and the distance it can travel.
20656,"The same way a seatbelt doesnt make you immortal



But look at me explaining something 99% of the world knows as if you were capable of independent thought"

20665,[removed]
20666,Absolutely!
20667,I meant that vaccinated people should be doing these things (and perhaps still considering masks in *certain* contexts).
20668,Governments have a role in getting that message out.
20669,"No, the slide you are referencing says breakthrough cases MAY be as transmissible as the unvaccinated."
20670,It also says in bright ass red letters that it’s preliminary data and subject to change.

20684,"Ebola is actually an example that has become less deadly as it became more virulent

Ebola used to be self containing in the 60s and 70s when we first started noticing it, because it would basically wipe out an entire village before it could spread

Now it makes more people less sick and for longer allowing it to spread much greater distances in newer outbreaks

Of course it's CFR is still extremely high (30%-60%) but earlier outbreaks were closer to 100%

Luckily it appears to be a good candidate to vaccinate against, and we've had some success with anti-virals."
20685,It's also much less contagious than something like COVID and proper controls and hygiene dramatically slow it's ability to spread.
20686,Exactly.
20687,Moral hazard.
20688,"It's the COVID positivity rate - the percentage of all COVID tests that were positive over, I think, a week."
20689,i was listening to an epidemiologist on the radio yesterday who claimed that giving a 3rd shot to people in wealthy countries who have already received 2 shots is a poor use of vaccines.
20690,We would be far better off distributing them to poorer countries who don't have any vaccines.
20691,"The reason we are dealing with the delta variant in the first place is because India had a dense population and practically no vaccines, which caused it to mutate."
20692,"If we don't deal with this in a global scale, we will inevitably be prolonging this pandemic as more dangerous mutations will continue to develop."
20693,makes a lot of sense.
20694,the government is not basing their solution in science by encouraging people to get a 3rd dose.
20695,Lol what?
20696,How exactly am I picking and choosing scientific fact?
20697,"The way you're describing it, you're making it sound like the efficacy rate against delta is 0% against infection which is just plain not true."
20698,[removed]
20699,Thank you.
20700,I'm glad I see one comment like this.
20701,"I read through this and asked, what's new."
20702,We knew this stuff already.
20703,TLDR: Get vaccinated.
20704,I'm going to continue my summer mask free.
20705,What's more concerning about this is what [the study on longer dosing intervals](https://www.healtheuropa.eu/longer-interval-between-pfizer-vaccine-doses-boosts-antibody-protection/110109/) found.
20706,"At the 8-week mark, so generally what Canada and the UK are doing, there were almost no detectable antibodies left, so people who are badly lagging on going back for the second dose are putting themselves at the same risk as the unvaccinated."
20707,"But they do stand to have significantly higher antibody levels afterward, so there's always that."
20708,"Not suprising, Fox News is tame to some of the shite that goes around social media."
20709,"no, that's ""probably"" = 51%+."
20710,am a lawyer not scientist but doubt it's different.
20711,may means nonzero.
20712,In US it's always a 3 weeks regime between 2 doses.
20713,"However in China, 2nd dose schedule is not that strictly controlled, you can come back in 3 weeks, 1 month or even 2 months from what I heard."
20714,Don't let me start on that 3 doses regime vaccine..... And inactivated virus vaccine really need 2 doses to be effective.
20715,"From  people I know, fully vaccinated are probably still the minority, but this is my personal experience though."
20716,And my observation is that younger people usually already got the vaccine and older ones still kind of skeptical or don't think it's that urgent to get vaccinated.
20717,And protection level from natural infection is minimal on the nation level.
20718,A much longer way to go from herd immunity compare to US.
20719,And most seniors in Alachua county are vaxxed.
20720,"But Gainesville is the destination for all the counties around it, that don't have good hospitals, don't vaccinate, don't mask, and go to Gainesville for all kinds of stuff."
20721,"It might be liberal, but it's still COVID saturated."
20722,Get it fda approved
20723,"It is pretty clear based on the data from Provincetown, Ma that VACCINATED INDIVIDUALS TRANSMIT THE VIRUS."
20724,You can’t pick and choose when you want to accept scientific fact.
20725,How is this “limited government”?
20726,"Leave it up to the individual cities, towns and schools."
20727,"Seriously though, you’re right."
20728,I’m sure of it
20729,[removed]
20730,How does may imply 50% and if it did imply 50% why would you call it 75%?
20731,You’re just pulling numbers out of thin air.
20732,May implies any number.
20733,Monitoring?
20734,They are acting like it's some thing to check an extra box on a report.
20735,"Collecting data is not ""monitoring""."
20736,It doesn't require some extra activity.
20737,Alberta has long been called the Texas of Canada
20738,Fellow redditor stuck in Alabama here.
20739,This post is an understatement.
20740,I work in public health kinda.
20741,Too much to go in to detail.
20742,"Needless to say, I see data from time to time regarding the vaccination rate and infected civilians."
20743,It’s not surprising we are number one.
20744,Only hospitals for the most part enforce masks.
20745,"We had business open, no masks and even more so the individuals who wore masks afraid of taking the vaccine due to misinformation."
20746,"If you wore a mask you’d be ridiculed at work, in schools, in stores, public open spaces."
20747,The only exception to this is the major universities.

20768,Anecdotally I can attest to that as my kids (3yo and 5yo) caught it without any indication but a positive test.
20769,I say rip off the bandaid.
20770,"If you don't want immunity from a vaccine, you can get it the good-old-fashioned risky way through infection."

20802,"You can decide what their weapon of choice would be, I don’t have that kind of creativity"
20803,I may have missed this previously - if so I apologize....but which shot did you get initially and which are you considering getting this time?
20804,People forget that influenza in children can actually get pretty bad.
20805,We ignore it and assume chances are low for it to be severe (and rightly so) but for some reason we cannot apply the same thinking to covid.
20806,[removed]
20807,The US makes up about 17% of over all confirmed cases.
20808,That number is most likely a lot lower since the US tests more then the vast majority of places so they find more cases.
20809,The odds a mutation outside of the US is A LOT higher then in the US.
20810,The odds of a mutation outside of the US is insanely higher then in vaccinated people in the US
20811,This is great news
20812,Resident of AL here and been fully vaccinated since the end of April.
20813,Nobody wears masks anymore since about early June.
20814,I live alone but my step dad refuses to get the vaccine and puts my 10 year old sister at risk.
20815,My mom says my little sister will wear a mask anyways but that still doesn't alleviate my stress about it.
20816,I grew up in rural southern AL and the amount of stupidity here is unreal.

20829,Still to my earlier point continuing to transmit the virus and increase the rate of mutation.
20830,Furthermore the delta variant consists of 5 sub variants.
20831,"4/5 are susceptible to the vaccine 1/5 isn’t, likely the strain circulating in Provincetown."
20832,"Since this strain has a positive evolutionary adaptation it will likely spread faster farther and wider than the other sub variants, likely becoming the dominant sub variant."
20833,I believe they call this delta plus.

21144,*
21145,You can just go get Moderna or Pfizer vaccine.
21146,I know of (immunocompromised) patients who have already completed up to 3 complete rounds with no issue.
21147,Getting multiple variants of the vaccine provides slightly better coverage.
21148,I live here....
21149,I'm at loss of what else I can do because people are just too damn stubborn here.
21150,DeSantis will ban testing so cases go down.
21151,"Far behind their aim, their aim is at least vaccineate 80% of all population."
21152,"That will include children, at least 12-17 before September."
21153,"Educated or not, people still voted Kenney in."
21154,And there’s a large percentage of Albertans that have just been phenomenally stupid over the last 18 months.
21155,Some Albertans have shown themselves to be complete idiots.
21156,"&gt; start learning about science

now lets look at what the inventor of mRna says about the vaccine....

he is against it????"
21157,but but the sciene???
21158,my god science has failed me?????
21159,its almost as if science isnt a singular object....
21160,I'm not arguing with you over the validity of the CDC mask guidelines.
21161,I literally said we should probably err on the side of caution.
21162,"I am arguing with you that in the grand scheme of our current Covid situation, vaccinated people probably play such a small role in driving transmission compared to the unvaccinated (who are typically also the same people who refuse to wear masks) that we are wasting time and polarizing people by putting responsibility on the people that, for the most part, have done what they were supposed to do."
21163,"And to your side note, slippery slope is a logical fallacy only when the assumption is made that one thing (A) happens it will certainly lead to something else (B) that, in reality, is unfounded, and the assertion is made out of fear rather than a reasonable argument against A."
21164,"It WOULD be a slippery slope to say that if the government could punish misinformation, all Republicans would be prosecuted because the government hates them."
21165,"It is NOT a slippery slope to say that if the government could punish misinformation, at some point people would likely be punished for spreading truths that the government deem to be false."
21166,"For example, when the pandemic began, Dr. Fauci said masks were futile in stopping the spread."
21167,"Prosecuting people that disagreed would have been a hindrance to slowing Covid, or better yet, should we punish Fauci for spreading misinformation by saying masks don't work?"
21168,All I'm saying is it's a good thing that science can function independently of government and we can flip-flop on things in the face of new evidence without worrying about legal ramifications.
21169,"If you want to talk about logical fallacies, you used an ad hominem attack by calling people who don't wear masks ""babies,"" and you used a black and white argument by saying unmasked vaccinated people are ""no better"" than unvaccinated people, when in reality they are much more protected from getting infected or transmitting Covid."
21170,"Vaccinated people who don't wear masks DO get hospitalized and transmit, but so do people with any other combination of those two things, all to varying degrees."
21171,Treating two very different groups as equal because you want to make it mask-wearers vs. anti-maskers is itself a logical fallacy.
21172,[removed]
21173,Bro are you serious lol
21174,As a scientist I have to say that the media is not bound by the same requirements that the scientific community is held to.
21175,"While I agree that the CDC messaging has been hard to follow and agree the media breaks information first, I do have to push back in the sense that the scientific method must be followed to prove the trend that the media is anecdotally reporting on."
21176,Sometimes this means replicating results through an additional study which is then followed by a board of peer review of the results.
21177,"I am not saying they could not be political, I'm merely stating that there is a proper method that must be followed."
21178,There are a lot of moving parts that must move in order for information to be presented.
21179,Republicans are terrorists

21186,"&gt;Ofc we’ll be living with Covid for the rest of our lives just like 99% of other diseases that exist, the normalcy I’m talking about is one where there are no restrictions - No masks, no social distancing, no testing unless for sparse localized outbreaks and that is possible once we vaccinate enough people."
21187,Yes.
21188,That's a pipe dream.
21189,Make peace with it.
21190,"&gt;which is why we actually need high vaccination rates to achieve herd immunity to protect these people from idiots who can’t do some basic responsibility of getting vaccinated to protect their own communities, much less themselves."
21191,"Whoa, whoa, whoa."
21192,Making choices for people against their will?
21193,People who won't take vaccines are idiots?
21194,"You're not racist, are you?"
21195,&gt;Yet African Americans have nearly the lowest rates of vaccination among any ethnic group.
21196,"In fact, white Americans are being vaccinated at a rate 3 times higher than Black Americans."
21197,"New CDC figures show that of those who have received at least the first dose of a vaccine, 5.4% are Black people, compared to 60% who are white people."
21198,"According to recent Kaiser Family Foundation poll, about 35% of Black Americans said they don’t plan to get the vaccine, citing fears about safety and concerns that the vaccines are so new."

21212,Wrong account.
21213,@sailorrooscout with the name chise.
21214,The other one is some random e. Account.
21215,"They really don’t want to be credible anymore, do they?"
21216,But it is our problem because we have to suffer for it.
21217,The only answer is to make it mandatory.
21218,The CDC data says 469 total cases were identified.
21219,Which science knew was going to happen
21220,I think the leaked reports from the CDC peg it at an R value of 8 or 9 with the delta variant.
21221,"and 60,000 is just the *Provincetown* summer population."
21222,How many people who were crammed into those bars were staying in Truro/Wellfleet/Eastham/Orleans/etc?
21223,does the gop realize that they're killing the people who support them?

21225,Mayo Clinic?

21230,Funny how only mouth breathers are elected to office in murica
21231,bc the fda is trash
21232,Why else would he do it?
21233,I doubt the legislature will change the ban on mask mandates.
21234,Too many legislators are receiving only 1 call in favor of masks for every 9 or 10 calls against.
21235,ACT 1002 does not does not include penalties for non-compliance.
21236,"A handful school districts are signaling their intention to mandate masks, even if it’s not overturned/changed."
21237,It was a huge mistake by Biden and the CDC.
21238,The requirements should have suggested you can drop mask mandates when your county reaches 70% vaccination rate.
21239,That way they could have pinned the idiots to the wall when this outbreak happened.
21240,Instead they gave all the unvaccinated all the power and they are not listening at all anymore
21241,"So private businesses needed the choice to require masks before, but now they aren't allowed the same choice."
21242,"Huh, weird"
21243,"This is a stance of not understanding science, history, logic, and more."
21244,I just read the Wikipedia for the 1918 pandemic and there is a picture of a health service announcement in the paper.
21245,Literally the first thing listed is 'Do not take any person's breath'.
21246,Is the movie 'Idiocracy' becoming reality?
21247,Truthfully these articles aren't very good lately.
21248,"They don't explain much and tend to favor ""if it bleeds it leads."""
21249,So just for fun.
21250,4 out of 5 hospitalized were vaccinated.
21251,Thats kinda shocking IMO.
21252,Lets say 1000 (close enough) people are infected due to this outbreak.
21253,75% were vaccinated so 750 people.
21254,4 of those were hospitalized.
21255,25% were unvaccinated so 250 people.
21256,1 of those were hospitalized.
21257,"So your chance is 1 out of 187.5 of being hospitalized while vaccinated in this outbreak

1 out of 250 unvaccinated."
21258,This seems worrisome doesn't it?
21259,Any thoughts on why this is?
21260,Truthfully-lots of things happen.
21261,Surgeries get cancelled and post op area becomes overflow ICU.
21262,The ER begins boarding ICU patients which decreases their throughout.
21263,At this point most hospitals begin implementing tents and staging.
21264,The entire ER and Peds ER (if there is one) converts to a majors area and overflow ICU.
21265,This is because the ER is already plumbed to have oxygen available in most beds plus has the outlets needed to run IV pumps and other machinery.
21266,"Tents get set up for minor care and staging, usually in the parking lot of the main ER."
21267,What you get is a system where patients get triaged on arrival to major and minor.
21268,"Typically Covid’s go to their own tent and those with normalish vitals get sent home, often with a portable oxygen sensor and instructions if oxygen gets low."
21269,Minors like lacs and sprains get treated and streeted as quickly as possible with emphasis on quick follow up do primaries can catch things that may have been missed.
21270,Majors still go to the ER/ICU but there care may not be as good as it could be without.
21271,Staffing usually gets upped with FEMA and state teams that are trained to work in Crisis Covid units.
21272,&gt;Follow the science.
21273,"""WHAT????"
21274,"the science, the only god i pray in is wrong????"
21275,"it cant be""

so you are saying that the vaccine doest stop the spread but helps individuals not to experience severe symptombs?"
21276,almost as if media lies and the vaccine was never made to stop the spread.
21277,Stop letting the media think for you.

21308,"&gt; By July 26, a total of 469 COVID-19 cases were identified among Massachusetts residents; dates of positive specimen collection ranged from July 6 through July 25 (Figure 1)."
21309,Most cases occurred in males (85%); median age was 40 years (range = &lt;1–76 years).
21310,Nearly one half (199; 42%) reported residence in the town in Barnstable County.

21316,I need to have a bunch of people in my home for a kids bday party that was planned prior to the recent increase in numbers.
21317,We are not letting anyone in the house unless they need to use the bathroom and we are going to make everyone coming in wear a mask.
21318,We are also going to open all of the windows.
21319,It might be hot so we are thinking of also running the Air conditioner.
21320,Is it a bad idea to run the AC for any reason if someone came in the house with covid?
21321,Does it spread it further/faster?
21322,Thanks
21323,This is politics over people.

21330,This is something I didn't even understand at the beginning.

21334,Let’s just assume for easy math.
21335,75% of those exposed were vaccinated.
21336,Then 75% of the cases were in vaccinated.
21337,That means the efficacy of the vaccine was 0%.
21338,Not good.
21339,"No shit, Sherlock"
21340,"I think it's the wrong account, it's got like 6 posts all in Chinese or some language like that."
21341,&gt; this wouldn’t be happening if you got the vaccine.
21342,...but it would have happened.
21343,it doesnt stop the spread.
21344,he could have still got covid.
21345,he could still have spread it.

21354,"Vaccine helps prevent catching it, yes it doesn’t prevent transmission to others once I have it."
21355,By saying it doesn’t stop transmission without any context really makes it sound like it doesn’t protect you from getting it.
21356,Your statement could be read wrong by some and used in misinformation.
21357,You might want to start elaborating on what you mean because I’ve been reading about unvaccinated people being confused about mixing up messages and still worried about getting the vaccine.
21358,Good news for my baby to early childhood coffin making business!
21359,How is this possibly justifiable?
21360,Why would anyone in Austin care if a locality like Grapevine issued a mask mandate?
21361,How can this even be enforced?
21362,The governor's powers aren't unlimited.
21363,This is absolutely idiotic political theatre at this point and I’m genuinely surprised that people are still buying this crap.
21364,"If you’re vaxxed, you’re protected much, much more than the unvaccinated."
21365,Not to mention that there was never a significant risk throughout the pandemic all the way from the beginning till now of the virus being transmitted outdoors.
21366,In what world would someone who’s already on the fence about being vaccinated want to get the shot after seeing this on the news?
21367,They're killing people.

21395,We all saw what happened in India and the UK regards to the cases.
21396,It was a matter of time before Delta hit US.
21397,Most of us were totally expecting a surge in US driven by Delta.
21398,Could the CDC not have seen this coming?
21399,"Or given the current politicization, could they have waited till the situation got worse before making new guidelines?"
21400,"Given that a lot of people still think masks are not required, I wonder if they were proactive, it could have backfired."
21401,Fuck these assholes
21402,Man Rona has been a wild ride as an Oklahoman.
21403,Absurd pro-Rona talk from our elected officials (and majority of our populace) followed by us doing shockingly well at vaccine distribution (not sure if the Trump-admin favoritism had a hand in this but the Tribal distribution definitely helped) like 6th in the nation until our ice storm which we promptly picked back up after then hitting ~30% vaccinated and our rates going to almost nobody getting vaccinated anymore and the pro-Rona talk gettin dialed to 11 and becoming pro-Rona policies.
21404,I love the several double entendres you slid up in there.
21405,"Article for those hitting a paywall:

&gt;A sobering scientific analysis published Friday of an explosive Massachusetts covid-19 outbreak fueled by the delta variant found that three-quarters of the people who became infected were fully vaccinated."
21406,"The report, from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, bolstered the hypothesis that vaccinated people can spread the more transmissible variant and may be a factor in the summer surge of infections."
21407,"&gt;The data, detailed in the CDC’s Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report, provided key evidence that convinced agency scientists to reverse recommendations on mask-wearing and advise that vaccinated individuals wear masks in indoor public settings in some circumstances."
21408,"&gt;Critically, the study found that vaccinated individuals carried as much virus in their noses as unvaccinated individuals, and that vaccinated people could spread the virus to each other."
21409,The CDC was criticized this week for changing its mask guidance without citing unpublished data.
21410,The report released Friday contains that data.
21411,"“This finding is concerning and was a pivotal discovery leading to CDC’s updated mask recommendation,” CDC director Rochelle Walensky said in a statement."
21412,"“The masking recommendation was updated to ensure the vaccinated public would not unknowingly transmit virus to others, including their unvaccinated or immunocompromised loved ones.”

&gt;Scientists said the Provincetown outbreak and other recent data on breakthrough infections make clear that the vaccines do work, as hoped, against severe illness and death, but do not offer blanket protection against any chance of infection."
21413,"Only a handful of people in the outbreak were hospitalized, but four of them were fully vaccinated."
21414,"A CDC internal document obtained by The Washington Post estimated that 35,000 vaccinated people a week are having symptomatic breakthrough infections out of a vaccinated population of more than 162 million."
21415,"Vaccination coverage is higher than average in Massachusetts, with nearly 70 percent of residents fully vaccinated."
21416,"“This shows the delta is formidable,” said Larry Corey, a virologist at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center."
21417,“We can’t take one report of packed bars and extrapolate and say the sky is falling.
21418,The sky is not falling.
21419,But it does say the vaccine is not infallible.
21420,"&gt;“Common sense has to be used,” Corey said."
21421,"“It’s a learning moment, it’s a teaching moment."
21422,You can’t overlook the vast data we have on the effectiveness of the vaccine.”
21423,Fuck yeah.
21424,Go Texas
21425,"Not really 

You must provide proof of vaccination or get the nasal brain probe every week."
21426,Also much of the paper pushers are teleworking so I don’t even think the tests apply to them until they come back to the office.
21427,An actual shot mandate would run into union lawsuits.
21428,This is just a testing regime that can be opted out of via vaccination.
21429,Which is a much lower bar to clear legally.

21481,If anything it’s a great example for why someone needs vaccinated.
21482,Every little bit helps
21483,"Base rate fallacy with an effective vaccine would be something like

80% of population is vaxed and 50% of cases are in the vaxed."
21484,So a large percentage of cases are in vaxed people but it’s less than the percentage of the total vaxed population.
21485,If the percent of vaccinated cases is the same as the percent of people vaccinated in the population it means your risk is the same as an unvaccinated person.
21486,"Again, downvote away people but this is just math based on the numbers provided in the story."
21487,"Good for you, I hope not wearing a seat belt works out for you."
21488,"Actual CDC report is here:

21489,Did you have to lie and say it your was your first shot or did they even ask you anything?
21490,I'm curious about what you would want them to do.
21491,Mandatory vaccines?
21492,"You'll have a hell of a time enforcing that, plus you'll just cause those who aren't vaxxed to dig in harder."
21493,There's not much we can do if the population doesn't give a fuck.
21494,"Sure, but now your can also be an unaware spreader"
21495,Texas has no freedom.

21499,All with the masses of sycophants cheering him on consequences be damned.
21500,Couple this with Hurricane Season coming up and we're in for a wild one.
21501,Yeah...I was so used to wearing one inside I figured I'd just keep doing it.
21502,I've gone out for dinner a few times without one though but will not be doing that again until cases in my area are on the downward slide again.
21503,It's also showing how much of the viral load even vaccinated people can spread with the Delta variant.
21504,Thus the rationale behind vaccinated people masking up.
21505,[removed]
21506,"This piece of information is concerning, but seems like an outlier:

&gt; The scientists, along with officials at the Massachusetts Department of Public Health, reported that 79 percent of vaccinated breakthrough infections were symptomatic."
21507,Four of five people who were hospitalized were fully vaccinated.
21508,They are analyzing the genetic fingerprints of the virus samples taken now to trace chains of transmission and determine how commonly fully vaccinated people were infecting one another.
21509,"I mean republicans have slowly been worshiping regan more and more, and regan really set the bar for the body count"
21510,This is genuinely ape shit crazy!
21511,"""Overreaction"" aside, it's morally bankrupt."
21512,"Certainly, I've seen businesses close during the pandemic because they couldn't change their models or couldn't afford to do so; arguably that's one reason the PPP was created - to help keep businesses afloat and to arguably help them keep doing safe business."
21513,"In Yorba Linda, for example, Taps (a local chain) started to renovate an old restaurant to open it - that was before the pandemic."
21514,"When the pandemic hit, they kept working, and also created outdoor seating by using some parking lot space, so they could comply with current safety guidelines."
21515,"They had no problems opening a new restaurant during the pandemic, and it's now a well established place."
21516,"This HB restaurant took the money and did the exact opposite, doing everything in their power to make it as unsafe as possible, including putting their own staff at risk by forcing them to remove masks (hence the OSHA fines) while bemoaning government ""overreaction,"" despite statistics clearly pointing to a serious increase in COVID infections due to the delta variant."
21517,"Some businesses weren't lucky enough to have additional space to make outdoor eating areas, especially places in downtown LA that are heavily urbanized."
21518,"But if you look at Basilico's on a map ([https://www.google.com/maps/place/Basilico's+Pasta+e+Vino/@33.6503376,-117.9540404,98m/data=!3m1!1e3!4m5!3m4!1s0x0:0xb1a9d11943c4927c!8m2!3d33.6502207!4d-117.954195](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Basilico's+Pasta+e+Vino/@33.6503376,-117.9540404,98m/data=!3m1!1e3!4m5!3m4!1s0x0:0xb1a9d11943c4927c!8m2!3d33.6502207!4d-117.954195)), they do have some parking lot space to use as outdoor dining space, just like Taps did."
21519,"Personally, I have very little sympathy for somebody who's going to use their restaurant as a political platform, instead of simply serving food and drink while respecting health regulations and the welfare of their guests and their own staff, and using some money to create safer outdoor eating space like many SoCal eatersies have."
21520,"If a person doesn't like government oversight, regulations, and compliance, the restaurant business is a pretty poor choice in vocation."
21521,I'll be curious to see how long this place will stay in business at this rate.
21522,Yeah it's part of the Dutch approach to return to normal.

21723,And 88% against delta.
21724,"AZ takes a hit as well, but still well above 50%

Looking at the (small) Indian study cited in the cdc presentation, the serum from ppl with mrna vaccine was better at neutralizing DELTA than serum from AZ vaccinated ppl was against ALPHA."
21725,"Further, the viral load part of the paper (data in supplement) was all based off physicians who got the AZ vaccine."
21726,So wr don't know viral loads after mrna.
21727,"If the goal is widespread vaccination, we need to reinforce the efficacy of these vaccines in the presence of delta, not unnecessary call it into question or downplay their efficacy."
21728,Lol.
21729,They're all adopted.
21730,Saying no to social workers is hard.
21731,Kind of makes you wonder why they want this
21732,Normal is when I can not wear a mask and travel without having to worry about getting tested.

* party of women imprisonment (abortion \*COUGH\* \*COUGH\*)
* party of war (iraq iraq vietnam escalation \*COUGH\* \*COUGH\*)
* party of lincoln, but today lincoln would be a democrat ..."
21735,Why require masks if they know everyone is vaccinated?
21736,Why not just make it optional for those who want too wear one?
21737,How do say “I’m going to put partisanship over people”  without saying “I’m going to put partisanship over people”
21738,US and Europe administers the first vaccines starting in Dec'2020 and both concentrate first on healthcare workers.
21739,"In the US it was in March that nearly every state had fully administered to all healthcare workers, elderly, people with conditions, and opened eligibility to the general public 15+, some states earlier than others, but mostly all in March."
21740,"By May eligibility expands to include 12+, and anyone that wants a vaccine can get one."
21741,"Most states by June have already vaccinated anyone that wants it, and now we are struggling to get those last holdouts."
21742,"Furthermore most states will now vaccinate anyone that shows up, you could be a foreigner visiting on vacation to California and you can get a vaccine here."
21743,"Japan only received their first doses of 20k, 3 months after the US or Europe, and then earmarked the first 4 million doses, which was expected to arrive over the next two months, only for healthcare workers."
21744,It wasn't until late April that Japan was able to expand eligibility to the elderly 65+.
21745,"That was all Pfizer, and on May 21st Moderna and AstraZeneca were approved for use, but AZ was temporarily put on hold, which was a big blow because Japan had made it's own AZ manufacturing plant."
21746,"The first shipments of Moderna were expected to arrive in June with 40 million doses, so the Japanese government announced eligibility would expand to everyone 15+ on June 21st (which was less than 6 months ago), but only 12.7 million doses showed up over the month expected."
21747,"Japan was offered vaccine from China for use for the IOC, but turned down the offer and instead reserved part of their shipments for the IOC."
21748,"Combine that reservation with under delivery from Moderna, failure with AZ, and some people got angry."
21749,Right now the Japanese government has a goal to secure enough vaccine for their population by September and vaccinate all willing people by November.
21750,But then that all leads into the 3rd point I made- the Japanese people have an inherent distrust of vaccines.
21751,"It comes from some botched MMR vaccine deployment in the early 90s, that lead to public outcry such that measles vaccine is no longer required in Japan (Or at least it wasn't a decade ago), and huge groups of people turning down flu shots afterwards."
21752,Japan still has some of the worst measles outbreaks of any first world country.
21753,That vaccine hesitancy has been difficult to overcome.
21754,"So to circle back to your question, you are correct that Japan has been receiving huge shipments of Pfizer from Europe, it's just they started receiving them 3 months later compared to the US or Europe."
21755,They have had problems with the other two major vaccines.
21756,Then large groups of their population have resisted the vaccine.
21757,I’m not sure what part of that talks about how the vaccine is no longer effective at preventing serve illness
21758,Yeah AZ is wild right now.
21759,Ducey basically told the CDC to get fucked

21761,I moved to Florida Last month.
21762,Granted I moved from Ohio so it's not that much different to say the least..
21763,Good question.
21764,Sore throat and runny nose here!
21765,Maybe our air quality is really crappy right now?
21766,I'm presenting one or two panels at an anime convention over Labor Day weekend.
21767,"I'm fully vaccinated, but I'm terrified of getting infected between now and then, causing me to miss the con."
21768,This is compounded by the fact that I have a business trip to Canada the week before.
21769,My anxiety is getting the better of me and I don't know what to do (besides keeping my mask on).
21770,This.
21771,I'm in SW Missouri and have been trying to tell people this for a couple months.
21772,The worst is even if you get vaxxed today you are not fully to what like 6 weeks
21773,More insidious than most because they can pretend they're not interfering.
21774,"That's why I wish people would stop spreading news like ""between March and July, only xx were infected in x compared to xxxxxxxxx unvaccinated."""
21775,We have no idea how many asymptomatic vaccinated people are spreading Delta.
21776,Most of the data was taken when other variants were dominant.
21777,Preventing further variants is as important as battling the current ones.
21778,"If you actually look at the article in cell reports, there isn’t any science or proof regarding vaccines in the paper, just a comment by the author."
21779,Title is blatantly wrong.
21780,"Meanwhile, my HOA is demanding we get permission for the color of mulch we use in our flower beds."
21781,Weird priorities.
21782,I think you’re not alone.
21783,"I understand the mechanisms that cause isolation to negatively impact mental health, but what about masks?"
21784,How does a mask negatively impact your mental health?
21785,"Admittedly, I wear my mask easily and don’t feel discouraged because I have to wear it, but I also have a kid who can’t be vaccinated or wear a mask and have had too many deaths in my own family (as have many Black folks in the US) to feel frustrated by this one measure."
21786,"So there’s a ton of bias on my part, but I’m wanting to learn different perspectives."
21787,I’ll grab the popcorn as we slowly watch Texas kill itself.
21788,Sounds like some towns should just secede from tejas and make their own state.
21789,But Portugal took things seriously.
21790,"Mandatory masks, curfews, and tests"
21791,Why do Republicans want to make America into a country of poor and sick people.
21792,Makes for a weak country
21793,Which cheeks?
21794,Explain to me how Texas is the land of freedom?
21795,Wow.
21796,That’s some backassward logic.
21797,"“People are mostly infected in gatherings where they aren’t wearing masks, so wearing masks is theatre”."
21798,What'd so many people die of?
21799,You are assuming the vaccines are never updated.
21800,I’ll challenge that.
21801,My brother (41) died from COVID complications but he had underlying issues.
21802,My mom (70) died after being on the vent for two weeks from COVID.
21803,Her brain had blood clots which ultimately killed her.
21804,My sister and I experienced my Mom dying in hospice and I’ll say it was fucking terrible.
21805,I got the vaccine the first day I could.
21806,My sister….
21807,She still to this day thinks the vaccine is a conspiracy….
21808,She even got COVID herself a few weeks ago pretty bad and still would not get the vaccine after all.
21809,I have no words for how crazy that is.

21812,"Lol, sorry, gonna trust the people that know what they're talking about instead, thanks for playing though."
21813,^pay ^them ^more
21814,I’m not trying to troll but if the vaccine is causing more asymptomatic spreaders of this virus that is not being shown with positive tests because they are not getting tested couldn’t vaccinated individuals be spreading this at a close rate with delta?
21815,Genuine question.
21816,Schools are using the cheek swab.
21817,I think the CA state employees who aren't vaccinated will be tested with the cheek swab as well.
21818,And the sad fact is that many texans will praise him for this.
21819,Except other countries don't recognize the 'mixed vaccine' approach and it has led to some countries treating Canadians with mixed vaccines being treated the same as unvaccinated.
21820,"There was a social media post going around about someone who went to Barbados with mixed doses, and were surprised on arrival to find out they'd have to quarantine their entire vacation there as they were treated as unvaccinated."

21841,If the CDC considers vaccinated people enough of a risk then that is enough for us to mask up again.
21842,The CDC has been pushing for the bare minimum to try to get compliance this whole time so erring on the side of caution would be the smart thing.
21843,"To assume we have an insignificant hand in the spread seems like an easy way to get into another ""oops, I wish we had done better"" situation."
21844,The CDC has lots of yet-unpublished data that is supposed to be released today that impacted their changes so we should wait and get current info before we dig in with outdated info.
21845,If folks want to be babies about it and pass on masks despite CDC guidance then they are no better in my eyes than the rest of them.

21859,"That’s a 14-year old take though

Nothing is a guarantee but there are actions you can take to increase chance for good things and decrease bad things."
21860,Because smokers and fat people and diabetics and whoever else you want to put in that group aren't all falling ill at the same time.
21861,"If there was a constant wave of smokers getting ill simultaneously, to the point where ERs had to choose to new patients, where hospitals were shutting down normal operations, where they were opening emergency field hospitals, where they were hiring every single travel nurse they could find and paying each one thousands of dollars a week and there still wasn't enough staff, if the hospitals were running out of PPE, if they had to bring in morgue trucks, if they had to bury people in mass graves, if they ran out of oxygen, if they had to close down massive parts of the economy - if they had to do all that just because of smokers, you better believe there'd be pushback against smokers."

21878,I’ve had Covid and it didn’t hurt me.
21879,"I got vaccinated, not because I was scared of dying from Covid, but because I wanted to protect those around me and also not have to wear a mask anymore."

21987,This isn’t just going to be a Florida thing.
21988,Duval county is like 59% fully vaxxed which only lags behind most higher vaxxed areas by about 10%.
21989,Then factor in natural immunity because of how much Florida got last year and it’s pretty clear that delta is gonna hit everyone.

21992,"Very little, you would effectively have to shut down travel with all countries if you do that."

21996,But those people are more likely to be vaccinated.
21997,&gt;This is pretty fear mongering [...] I don’t know that still sounds to me like the vaccine is working.
21998,You can acknowledge both that vaccines work to keep you from severe symptoms and the fact that the delta is more effective at breakthrough infection.
21999,These are NOT mutually exclusive.
22000,I understand that you don't like hearing this news (me neither) but they can both be true.

22013,I went about 20 years without catching the flu.
22014,Then I had kids.
22015,Caught it 3-4 times in 5 years.
22016,"Stomach flu is the best, especially when you have 5 people all throwing up at 3am."
22017,What the fuck is wrong with the US?
22018,"Considering Massachusetts has one of the highest vaccination rates in the country, with nearly 70%, it sounds like not a good deal."
22019,"So for me, it started as finding them incredibly uncomfortable (yes, I've tried lots of varieties) and hot."
22020,It makes it feel like it's difficult to breathe.
22021,"Then pretty quickly it became a huge acne issue (and yes, I've tried washing them frequently, disposable masks, etc)."
22022,"That's actually pretty damn painful, obviously a hit on self confidence, and so far appears to be permanent scars."
22023,"The longer I have to continue wearing them, the worse that's going to get."
22024,"Those things are still the case, but now on top of that there's this whole mental piece."
22025,Masks undoubtedly put the idea in people's heads (or keep it there) that we're all just disease vectors to each other.
22026,"It feels like it pushes us to this point where we don't view other people the same way anymore, and that's really really depressing."
22027,"It's a constant reminder of all of the terrible things that have happened over the past year, and honestly putting on a mask is enough to make me spiral for the rest of the day at this point (and I recognize that I'm pretty lucky in the sense that I don't have to put one on every single day to go to work)."
22028,So something that before was enjoyable is now marred by this combination of physical discomfort/actual pain and some pretty serious mental issues with them.
22029,"I pushed through that for a long time to try to keep doing the things I love and support my community, but I just don't have it in me anymore."
22030,"I know that sounds dumb to a lot of people who are used to them and don't have issues with them, but it's honestly the way I'm feeling."
22031,"I got vaccinated asap with a pretty big motivator being the fact that it was another step towards removing masks, and at this point if the requirement comes back where I live, I'm just going to be home all the time again."
22032,Don't let anxiety control your thoughts.
22033,You've been vaccinated so you have the best medical protection available on the planet to protect you from this pandemic.
22034,"I'm sending you some positive vibes, and I'm looking forward to hearing how awesome the con presentation goes."

22042,"Fun thing is if they survive, the innate immunity from getting it isn’t as good as if they got the vaccine in the first place, meaning they could get it again and again and feel like garbage every time."
22043,"But once they get it and get the vaccine, the vaccine will make them feel infinitely worse than it would have if they had just gotten the vaccine in the first place had they gotten it before getting sick."
22044,Literally took the hardest road to get there.
22045,And so many more will die and/or have long term side effects from listening to Republican / Trump rhetoric.
22046,Unvaccinated people get tested when they go to the hospital.
22047,Vaccinated people get tested when they hear of a possible exposure.
22048,"Just like they wear masks more often, vaccinated are more likely to be tested when they are asymptomatic."

22052,This is as disturbing as it is confusing.
22053,882 were tied to the outbreak.
22054,"Among those who lived in Massachusetts (which could be anywhere between 4 and 882), 74% were fully immunized (highly concerning)."
22055,The vast majority (of the 882?
22056,Or of the MA individuals?
22057,Is vast majority 51% or 99%?)
22058,were reporting symptoms (mild symptoms?).
22059,"Seven people were hospitalized (again, of the smaller MA group or of the full 882?)."
22060,"If it’s of the 882, then &lt;1% were hospitalized."
22061,And the 882 is out of how many people?
22062,Hundreds?
22063,Thousands?
22064,Tens of thousands?
22065,"If most people in MA are fully vaccinated (which is true) you’d certainly expect a higher amount of infections among vaccinated than in other areas because so many more people are vaccinated, but it’s hard to make heads or tails out of this other than WEAR A MASK."
22066,"Its just plain safer, fully vaccinated or otherwise, and if you go out in public wearing pants or shoes it’s entitled whiny posturing to claim that wearing a mask is any more inconveniencing."
22067,What ever happened to common sense?
22068,It should be a mandatory class.
22069,"You can’t ban abortion legally, so that’s a pretty bad example."
22070,Leaving mask requirements up to the individual towns and cities would be the definition of limited government in this case.
22071,What a fucking placating moron.
22072,It's a god damned thin piece of fabric you wear to go to the store or shopping.
22073,I've had to do manual labor with these on.
22074,IT IS NOT THAT FUCKING BAD YOU DUMBASS DRAMA QUEENS.
22075,WEAR YOUR FUCKING MASK.

22120,"The vaccines are still very effective, so we still need to keep pushing those."

22211,so many countries have vocal minorities like this and they still locked down and then fined or jailed anyone who broke lockdown.
22212,The US wont do it because the almighty New York Stock Exchange demands you sacrifice your body to truck that freight because the global economy cannot be allowed to stop for two weeks or else some rich asshole's stock portfolio means he will only get to retire with 3 houses instead of 4.
22213,Everything the CDC has done it has done with the US economy in mind first and American safety second.
22214,"I mean...only as easy as going to a local library, or meeting up with a friend for a coffee - both of those are externalities an abuser might try to limit."
22215,"In a situation like that, where the victim is subject to constant monitoring, it might not be the easiest thing to come up with a workable excuse."
22216,"does the vaccine provide high level of protection against becoming infected
OR
against high level of heavy condition due to infection?or both?"
22217,Only Nick Saban can save them.
22218,The tests dont.
22219,"After the test is done and you get the positive/negative result, the swab is sent to a lab who do genetic testing to determine the variant."
22220,I believe that most of the Delta diagnoses are based on the symptoms you have (as Delta symptoms are slightly different to the symptoms of other variants).
22221,How about both?
22222,"I mean, I disagree with both approaches at this point."
22223,"No forced mandates, no forcing a lack of mandates."
22224,It’s an overreach either way with vaccines available.
22225,Why does that not surprise me in the slightest
22226,Well what I noticed was a lot of people were lying to themselves and other people on this sub in particular (maybe not this thread so much) with the idea that having a vaccine meant they couldn’t get infected or spread the virus which we knew wasn’t the case months ago.
22227,The vaccine was always portrayed by the science community as offering personal protection from severe cases/symptoms but did not have a super significant effect on spread/infection.
22228,So its absolutely insane to watch people react so harshly to a reality that has been known since the vaccine has been around really.
22229,AT LAST!!
22230,Alabama is FINALLY the #1 state in the nation for something!
22231,Hospitals have required masks/vaccination for employment for as long as I can remember for flu season and now during COVID.

22251,"I mean, look how well it turned out"
22252,I see the mouth breathing antivax people saying ‘see?
22253,We all had chicken pox and everything is fine’ completely missing the point this is on how contagious it is and has nothing to do with virus severity.
22254,Booster shots are meant to be done at least 6 months after your last shot.
22255,Do not get a 3rd booster shot unless you are told to do so by your doctor.
22256,It feels like that would be the just thing to do but our healthcare system is not based on any sort of justice.
22257,"It's based on treating patients with the greatest need first, for better or worse."

22284,The efficacy is still in the range of what we expect vaccines to be in.
22285,"The &gt;90% efficacy numbers are just insanely good, so people are not calibrated right."
22286,"I live in a well-vaccinated liberal small city, and I popped into one of the more ""play it safe"" coffee shops this morning."
22287,"They still don't do indoor seating, but they took a long time to stop asking people to wear masks, and I thought they might be quick to backtrack."
22288,"But no, the staff was mostly unmasked, as well as the customers."
22289,"I'm pretty pleased by that, and pretty surprised."
22290,"My county is not on the CDC's list for significant spread, but I expected a little more panic here."
22291,Not so much.
22292,I have been starting to think breakthrough infections were occurring more frequently.
22293,74% would be crazy... but I think even 25% of cases being vaccinated would set us back a lot... but my biggest concern is my unvaccinated kid and spreading it to her myself.
22294,Breakthrough cases are rare enough they should not be concerned.
22295,Just because the media/Reddit reports every single one is not a good indicator of the real world.
22296,I don’t know.

22305,"She's in New York City, in the USA."
22306,She really needs a booster if they can be gotten.
22307,She's immunocompromised with vastly diminished lung function.
22308,Most people going clubbing in the Netherlands on June 26 would not have been fully vaccinated though.
22309,"For example, I'm 31 and will receive my second dose of Pfizer next week and will be considered fully vaccinated in mid-August."
22310,"I imagine most people going out clubbing are younger than me, so you can probably add a week or two on for when most of them would be fully vaccinated with a two dose vaccine."
22311,The Dutch government promoted 'Dansen met Janssen' where you would be considered fully vaccinated and could go clubbing on the day of receiving the vaccine.
22312,"If you weren't vaccinated yet, you could take a lateral flow test (and there were plenty of issues with how that was carried out as well)."
22313,We don't need to shame people for doing the exact thing their government told them was okay (but in my view it was a poor decision from the government).
22314,You mean people unable to work for weeks/dying in droves and the unwillingness of people to go to brick and mortar is ruining every business.
22315,What.. Dumb fucking statement.
22316,But of course
22317,Right I agree.
22318,I think it will become more regional and sporadic in the western/wealthy world.
22319,And hopefully at that point or sooner rather than later we will focus effort on vaccinating these developing nations quicker.
22320,That's a significant reduction from 95%.
22321,Vaxxed people need to socially distance and wear masks for the next 6-10 weeks at least.
22322,We need more lockdowns
22323,"Serious: 
1."

22327,Are vaccines safe to use for people who had history of thrombosis?
22328,"Is this saying that they expect up to 1.2 million infections weekly, or a peak of up to 1.2 million infections by the week of August 21?"
22329,The year definitely sucked for the most part with all the restrictions and I'm in New York so felt it hard.
22330,Really bugs me that they're talking about potentially more restrictions because I need to work.
22331,My family and social circle were really fortunate last year as most of us weren't exposed to covid.
22332,I know one person who was and she's absolutely fine (was pregnant at the time and is also older).
22333,So we got through the worse of the pandemic (we still went out and did what we could) and now most of us are vaccinated.
22334,It's also real frustrating because the people who will follow the guidelines are the ones are paying attention and getting vaccinated.
22335,"How many people are allowed to get the vaccine but refuse, and will suddenly comply with another mask mandate?"
22336,We've been at this for a year and a half and the messaging still sucks.
22337,"I'm at a point where I'm saying ""fuck it, I'm going to do what's best for me."""
22338,I'm inclined to wear a mask indoors when I shop again not because I'm worried about getting ill with delta but testing positive on a test and not being able to work for a few weeks.
22339,A few years ago I read 'And The Band Plays On' which is about the AIDS outbreak in the 70s and 80s and how the government and society bungled that.
22340,It'll be real interesting to read the debriefs and mistakes that happened during covid if it ever fucking ends.
22341,Just hope it's not something dumb like you're more likely to catch it if you're not hydrated enough.
22342,"At this point, with close to 90% of new cases being Delta, you can assume it is"

22345,Yeah we should just perpetually make the virus cycle instead of wearing masks.
22346,These idiots don’t understand how small businesses work /s
22347,did you type that without wearing an N95?!
22348,Now everyone in this thread has been exposed
22349,Texas sized small government
22350,"Vaccines have never been able to stop you catching a virus."""
22351,Not true!
22352,It depends on the virus.
22353,"For many viruses, vaccines provide ""sterilizing immunity"" which prevents the disease in the first place."
22354,"The vaccines for chicken pox, small pox (I presume), polio, hepatitis B, etc... prevent infection entirely."
22355,This was true of the Covid vaccines as well (esp the mRNA vaccines) against the original virus.
22356,Hopefully it will be true again once the mRNA is tweaked to better target the variants.
22357,"""It just doesn't stand to reason that the virus spreads ""as easily through the vaccinated population"" - hope you are right about this, and I'm guessing that you are, but that is not what the article is saying."
22358,edit: typos
22359,do you have a source for the Australia story?
22360,would like to know more details of what happened bc that shit is scary.
22361,"im fine masking indoors if its needed (im vax'ed and live in MA so our numbers are climbing but not horrible yet) but it was nice to finally get out and see people, and obv with it being summer here its nice to hang outside without having to avoid people again (crossing streets, making tons of extra room, etc)."
22362,"&amp;#x200B;

also the fact now we're going entirely backwards (masks back on indoors for everyone, recommendations to mask outside), its gonna be tough to get people back on board again."
22363,this timeline sucks.
22364,"Every vaccine patent needs to be released to be copied as domestic generics, it is inhumane to poor countries."
22365,Fuck private pharmaceutical companies
22366,Right I agree.
22367,I think it will become more regional and sporadic in the western/wealthy world.
22368,And hopefully at that point or sooner rather than later we will focus effort on vaccinating these developing nations quicker.
22369,My youngest is ineligible and will be for some time.
22370,Also have a baby due in October.
22371,This is fucked .
22372,*Every* business?
22373,Every single business on this planet?
22374,That's just objectively false.
22375,You sure sound like you know a lot about business.
22376,Can you share your credentials?
22377,I swear that what more disgusted me is not no-vax communities but many newspapers of my country.
22378,"Extreme cover to people dead after vaccine with no autopsy administered, even some cases borrowed from USA unconfirmed (if not totally fake) ""news"", clickbait articles on vaccines, de-contextualized Fauci claims (a lot of, lastly ""vaccinated individuals are contagious as the unvaccinated"" in articles' titles, forgetting that Fauci also acknowledged most vaccinated do not even get positive), etc..

And these newspapers are not pushing anti-vax propaganda, they also share news of kids or unvaccinated elders dying by COVID."
22379,They are just shamelessly milking money with clickbait and either ads or more commonly paywalled articles.
22380,So any publishable trash is published relentlessly.
22381,"People who follow the news also on Facebook are obviously confused by being exposed to so many ""realities"" and their anger grows."
22382,"Facebook did really a bad job when it was about letting anti-vax communities build up and grow, but I'm very mad to many journalists of our own who just were careless all the year so far for the award of more clicks"
22383,It probably would mitigate collapsing the hospital system with covid people.
22384,But won’t mitigate outbreak as we still have outbreaks of flu and cold.
22385,"Yeah I bought 12 things of Lysol wipes, 4 things of hand sanitizer wipes, 4 big things of hand sanitizer and Lysol sprays to donate to my kids classes."
22386,I also got mine individual wrapped masks so they can toss at home at the end of the day.
22387,I might have them double mask and stock up on masks for the school if they decide to mask.
22388,We homeschooled last year and it's taking a toll on all of us mentally.
22389,We moved during all this and both my kids are really lonely and it's been super hard.
22390,I have a call with my therapist in a few to get her perspective.
22391,I keep going back and forth but they need it mentally and so do I.
22392,"Actually yesterday we just stopped requiring COVID positive people to isolate/quarantine, we aren’t requiring close contacts of positive cases to isolate/quarantine, we aren’t doing contact tracing, and we aren’t offering asymptomatic testing."
22393,It’s going great /s
22394,Wahlah?
22395,Are there any studies around this?
22396,The vaccines protect against symptomatic infection at a level of 85% or more.
22397,That’s damn good.
22398,The longer you wait the harder it's gonna be.
22399,Small changes over the next decade will pay off big time.
22400,I understand.
22401,"I'm saying thats the same argument as ""I paid off my student loans, why should the irresponsible people who didn't get a break?"
22402,"I should get reimbursed for what I paid then""

Be happy you got the vaccine and move on."
22403,"As you said, $100 doesn't go very far anyways"
22404,People want data.
22405,Here it is.
22406,The only disease more infectious than covid is the measles.
22407,And universal masking will reduce spread.
22408,Where did you read that?

22410,[deleted]
22411,"The 17x number is definitely misleading; however, what you are describing absolutely does have to do with spreading the disease."
22412,"Vaccinated people are as likely to spread covid as unvaccinated people, *if they get a breakthrough infection.*."
22413,"The vaccine is still ~75-85% effective against those, per the CDC."
22414,Found the idiot
22415,Yeah exactly.
22416,Stupid idea
22417,"under rules ""no edited titles"" 

The headline was ""Facebook News Consumers Are More Anti-Vaccine Than Fox News Viewers, Study Finds"""
22418,That how I read it but found the phrasing confusing
22419,"With any luck, those future waves won't fill hospitals with patients, and won't be cause for nearly as much concern!"
22420,Nuke the place with Lysol from orbit.
22421,It's the only way to be sure.
22422,Maybe all the vaccines meant for anti-vaxxers here in the States should be sent to Australia and other countries where the vaccine is hard to get.
22423,The more people critique this paragraph the more I realize how poorly it is written.
22424,It's really unclear what the actually numbers and status are.
22425,Are you this myopic in all areas of your life?
22426,It kind of puts in to perspective where priorities should be which is in sharing vaccines to further progress worldwide.
22427,South Africa has like 6% vaccine coverage total.
22428,Africa overall has 1.5 I think?
22429,You still have to factor Natural immunity from infection as some kind of barrier.
22430,But all of these developing nations pose far more threat than the current issue within our borders.
22431,"Let the dog shit in the backyard, pick it up wearing your underwear."
22432,"So, 50/50."
22433,"Seriously, though - 50/50, and it depends on your politics, apparently."
22434,I’m fucking terrified for my toddler
22435,"If it affects the people around them, does that still apply or should it be considered an appropriate response?"
22436,Shocked faces abound.
22437,Unless those businesses receive state funding unless that business receiving state funding is a nursing home or living facility.
22438,"Yes, I did put that in the most confusing possible way on purpose."
22439,"More clearly:

Nursing homes:  Always allowed to require vaccinations."
22440,Private Businesses: Only allowed to require masks/vaccines if they don't receive state funding.
22441,"Now, I don't know what ""receive state funding"" means."
22442,I assume if I'm a government contractor with a contract with the state that would count.
22443,But what about if I allow people to pay with SNAP/EBT cards?
22444,Or I accept Medicaid patients?
22445,"Do those things also count as ""state funding?"""
22446,African Americans historically don't trust government because there group has been used as political weapons for decades.
22447,I’m not surprised.
22448,The algorithm on Facebook is pretty horrid.
22449,I heard my parents watching a video on FB the other day about how the vaccines are being used as a global conspiracy to combat overpopulation by killing people off.
22450,No joke there’s idiots that believe that shit.
22451,[removed]
22452,"this is where we use the surprised pikachu face, right?"
22453,It’s the principle of it.
22454,Why reward the idiots and assholes who are prolonging the pandemic and making lives of healthcare workers hell?
22455,I’m fucking tired of us revolving around them.
22456,I’d like to see more workplaces firing antivaxxers and health insurance refusing coverage.
22457,Enough.
22458,It’s been for a loooong time.
22459,It just wasn’t easily visible to the public.
22460,"“War on drugs”, anti-abortion, support of oil &amp; gas literally contributing to climate change, etc…do you remember Tr*mp wanted to bring back coal?"
22461,In 21st century when the scientists are warning us about climate change he wanted to bring back coal!!
22462,!
22463,I think I heard there's something like 12 states that have some sort of prohibition on local governments and/or businesses requiring masks and/or vaccines.
22464,Crazy!
22465,They did it!
22466,"First in covid, last in education!"
22467,Those two things are probably unrelated... (unlike their wives)
22468,Its one big family out there.
22469,Just one.
22470,Is there a breakdown of this per vaccine type?
22471,"The cycle of pleading:

22482,"Since mix-and-match hasn't been officially studied or accepted by the WHO, there are countries and businesses (like US cruise lines) that treat people with mix-and-max vaccines the same as unvaccinated people."
22483,"A Canadian who went to Barbados for vacation a month or two ago found out on arrival that they were required the same as an unvaccinated person, and Canadians are finding that they aren't eligible for 'vaccinated-only' US cruises that they booked."
22484,"I posted a small rant a few days ago about how my company wasn't enforcing masks for unvaccinated people and using ""the honor system"" instead."
22485,And it's a pretty low percentage of my coworkers who are actually vaccinated (-_-).
22486,Welp.
22487,"They had a big company event on Monday, tons of people packed in a tent but it was ""outside"" so nobody masked."
22488,"I didn't go, but they had a livestream so I did watch."
22489,Tuesday got the email that somebody who was there tested positive.
22490,Today got the email that the office is shut down indefinitely because more people are having symptoms.

22493,and I'm just like............ yay home-grown super spreader event.
22494,Sad thing is I work with a lot of older people (who aren't vaccinated).
22495,I really hope we get thru the outbreak without any more deaths.
22496,"Nah, I’m in Ontario, Canada and testing is available as walk-ins in pharmacies."
22497,"I got a fast test with my girlfriend just to clear our minds, we were even sick."
22498,Our positivity rate here is 0.8%.
22499,"Don’t fool yourself, it’s really really bad."
22500,I completely understand.
22501,There are risks to the vaccine.
22502,These risks are very minimal but these age groups do really well with the virus.
22503,So there is not much discrepancy in the risk and benefits.
22504,Thus the unknown possible long term side effects of someone that could have 70+ years of life left is something to consider.
22505,If the child is under 12 then the correct dosage needs to be determined and I think they are currently studying that.
22506,For those weighing in long covid then know that breakthrough cases are showing symptoms of long covid.
22507,Without more data it is difficult to know if this should or should not impact your decision.
22508,Given the increased transmissibility of Delta does that mean that cloth masks likely aren't effective?
22509,Should be people be wearing N95s?
22510,That's so fucking awesome.
22511,My husband had to get tested last week as he got sick from someone at work.
22512,"We are faced, but our 18 month old is not."
22513,Couldn't find a test for days.
22514,Had to buy a home one.
22515,"Then kid got sick and had to tale him to the dr. Thankfully, not covid, but since his coworker refused testing....well...we had to make sure."
22516,The data on the right-hand side of [this document](https://1lnfej4c7wie44voctzq1r57-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Fact-Sheet_Workers-Need-Respirators.pdf) shows that a cloth FC (face covering) can prevent you from getting an infectious dose for between 33 hours and 20 minutes based on what the infected person is wearing.
22517,Thats based on the person being within 6 feet of the infected for the whole time.
22518,That document appears to have been created in May before Delta really boomed so I'd say there's less protection now.
22519,Especially given that the time to get an infectious dose of Delta seems to be much lower.
22520,So to answer you question - no I dont think there is a Delta specific study out there.
22521,But N95 seem to be the way to go.

22537,"Not sure if it's the same type as 'normal' long Covid, but it is happening."
22538,Thankfully 15% of the total number of symptomatic breakthrough cases is still fairly low (something like .53% if I remember the math from that thread correctly)
22539,About time
22540,Except Texans.
22541,"&gt;This week’s national ensemble predicts that the number of newly reported COVID-19 cases will likey increase over the next 4 weeks, with 200,000 to 1,200,000 new cases likely reported in the week ending August 21, 2021."

22555,Advent Health has more COVID-19 hospitalizations right now than any other time since this began.
22556,Bets on this week’s number?
22557,"It was averaging about 10,500 a day last week if their weekly number is complete."
22558,"I’d say the weekly number will be at least 100,000 for July 23-30."
22559,Atlanta is an oasis of blue in a sea of blood red.
22560,Zero chance of anybody putting masks back on in the state anywhere outside the 285 perimeter.
22561,"(Ok maybe a handful in Athens, Macon, various other smaller cities)"
22562,Wasn’t there a case in Australia where contact tracing discovered a person was infected by someone walking past them outside of a store?
22563,You're missing a key feature of the vaccines in your analysis here: the reduction in severity.
22564,"COVID with an Rt of 1.6 in an unvaccinated population is definitely bad news, but COVID with an Rt in a population that is overwhelmingly protected from severe disease is simply not that big of a deal."
22565,The common cold's Rt is 2-3 but we don't give it a second thought.
22566,"I'm not saying it won't still be threatening to some, but so is influenza and we don't all catch up on pages of influenza news every day during flu season (although personally I would love to see more courtesy masking during cold and flu season and more young people getting the flu shot.)"
22567,I think there are a lot of vaccinated people in here who are reading alarming sounding numbers and then vastly overestimating their personal risk from covid.
22568,"A lot of the vaccinated cases that we're finding aren't in people who felt sick, they're in people who get tested routinely for work and otherwise would have had no idea they were even carrying the virus."
22569,"At this point if you're young, healthy, and vaccinated there are SO many other things to worry about that present more of a risk than covid."
22570,This only has meaning in relation to the death rate.
22571,A ton of people catch the cold every year.

22573,"Hospitalization is meaningful

Death rate is meaningful."

22622,"Two weeks later, it's a billion people, which is of course nonsense, because we're not in one giant tight space spreading the virus to each other."
22623,"But it does suggest an extremely rapid flare out for any outbreak, which is what some countries have shown and some people are predicting."

22643,"During a June outbreak in Australia, where the virus had been previously well controlled despite an extremely low vaccination rate, New South Wales Health Minister Jeroen Weimar warned that transmission had occurred with only “fleeting contact” between individuals."
22644,"For example, contact tracing and genomic sequencing showed that a woman in her 70s was infected while sitting outside a cafe visited by “Patient Zero,” an airport limo driver."

22654,"As of last week, there were [153k symptomatic breakthrough cases total](https://abcnews.go.com/US/symptomatic-breakthrough-covid-19-infections-rare-cdc-data/story?id=79048589) since vaccines started being tested."
22655,"(0.098% of vacci


Now compare that to the [1,224k  cases a reported](https://www.us-covid-tracker.com/?per100k=0&amp;consistentY=0&amp;field=cases&amp;time=1mo) in the general population just over the last 30 days."

https://www.washingtonpost.com/context/cdc-breakthrough-infections/11fc6a11-20d7-466e-a654-c6bc8426f688/
  
The takeaway is that infections in vaccinated people (which is still rarer than unvaccinated) are just as contagious."
22657,"But even symptomatic breakthrough cases, relatively rare as they may be, are far and away more mild."
22658,"The actual *threat* is still to the unvaccinated population, and they can't count on the rest of us to be a buffer against the virus for them."
22659,Which is why the rest of us are all being asked now to mask up on their behalf -- at least at my workplace.
22660,&gt;than the inverse scenario where a bunch of different countries all over the world would have their vaccination campaigns entirely run by the WHO but have completely disconnected and wildly different borders.
22661,No one has ever grouped this bunch of different countries together though.

22665,I mean you can't be too careful with this Delta Airlines variant or else you will never be able to redeem your SkyMiles.
22666,Brb gonna share this on Facebook.
22667,It’s an article that basically just explains that we can’t always explain everything about why Covid cases rise and fall in one place or another.
22668,"We try explanations ranging from weather to vaccination rates to various policy interventions, but sometimes they just don’t seem sufficient or they sound perfect in one place but not in another (like late summer arrival could explain the recent drop in cases in the UK but not the similar drop in India)."
22669,One thing it discusses that your other comment doesn’t mention is why the alpha wave in the US was localized to Michigan and Minnesota to a lesser extent.
22670,Usually outbreaks start in one place and spread far and there were other states that had much fewer restrictions at the time.
22671,[removed]
22672,"Still, the ease with which the Delta variant passes from one person to another has caught public health experts by surprise."
22673,"During a June outbreak in Australia, where the virus had been previously well controlled despite an extremely low vaccination rate, New South Wales Health Minister Jeroen Weimar warned that transmission had occurred with only “fleeting contact” between individuals."
22674,"For example, contact tracing and genomic sequencing showed that a woman in her 70s was infected while sitting outside a cafe visited by “Patient Zero,” an airport limo driver."
22675,"In another instance, the virus seems to have been transmitted in the time it took for two unmasked strangers to pass each other in a shopping center, an encounter captured by mall security cameras."

22678,How is it misleading?
22679,It's been half a year and England is on their way out of their Delta wave...

22681,That sounds great!

22692,No thanks.
22693,I'm vaccinated and no data suggests I have an equal chance of severe illness or death compared to those who refuse the vaccination.

22695,I went to my counties fair a couple of nights ago.
22696,No kids under 12 wearing masks.
22697,They'll be okay.
22698,I'm sure you'd love that
22699,How common is it for breakthroughs to show up negative on aPCR test?
22700,I know the nature of this is still uncertain but the false negative factor is also interesting.
22701,Yeah…are you actually a doctor/nurse?
22702,Nothing you’ve said is accurate.
22703,How does someone not need oxygen when they need oxygen?
22704,"And how does an intubated patient that is placed in a medically induced coma actually press a call button, you know, when they’re in a coma."
22705,Unless you are to the point that you’re not sedating your intubated patients…which isn’t happening.
22706,This virus is lucky there's so many stupid people in humanity who will flat out refuse measures that could wipe it out if everyone did them
22707,Why have kids during a pandemic.

22788,&gt;The science that says the vaccine protects well against even the delta variant?
22789,"It offers a useful degree of protection, yes."
22790,But not enough protection in areas where the overall prevalence is being pumped by a large unvaccinated population.
22791,"At present, vaccination is only one in a number of tools best layered in combination; it won't be ""the answer"" until it's near total."
22792,"Especially because globally it never will be - the hope would be that in a locality, vaccination rates are high enough that ""travel cases"" usually fizzle out after infecting only a few other breakthrough cases, rather than sparking an explosion in a substantial unvaccinated population."
22793,That what I thought too but after digging into it I'm not so sure its that bad of a situation.
22794,This was a resort town with thousands of people most likely very liberal and highly vaccinated.
22795,The smaller amount of unvaccinated cases might just be due to the fact that there are WAY less of them.
22796,Thanks!
22797,I’m literally a doctor in one of the states you listed.

22801,"Each one of those deaths is tragic, yes, but that's not the type of number that should force everyone to upend their lives all over again."
22802,The threat of another mass casualty event like we saw in March 2020 or last winter just does not exist anymore.

22825,Words are cheap.

22827,That's because it is.
22828,Restriction and lockdowns will return if hospitals fill up.
22829,"It sucks, but what other options are there?"
22830,Hospitals are a fundamental pillar of society.
22831,"The best we can hope for is that people who were hesitant, flock to get the vaccine in reaction to hospitals filling up."

22838,That's not how averages work though...
22839,"If a spike doesn't show up in a rolling average, it isn't a spike - it's just normal fluctuation."
22840,"If a true spike is happening, it will show up in weekly averages."
22841,Daily numbers will have noise just by nature.
22842,"Not defending only releasing weekly reports instead of daily, but you can't just hide a spike by using a weekly average."
22843,I've experienced the pandemic in Singapore where mask mandate indoors and outdoors is the norm and law that carries severe punishment.
22844,People have no issues complying with it.
22845,It makes everyone around safer (vaccinated or not) and allowed life to resume to almost normal with LITTLE FEAR and anxiety.
22846,"People in the US are so opposed to masking (even for non political reasons) calling it uncomfortable, anxiety inducing, etc."
22847,I find it ridiculous that wearing a mask induces more anxiety than knowing that you have more protection??
22848,"If everyone would just mask up until we can get the rest of the population vaccinated one way or another, our anxiety level would be lower as a whole."
22849,People being selfish and ignorant is what's causing the current spike.
22850,Yes you did your part by getting vaccinated.
22851,Just keep wearing mask until the end of the year and not pound your chests like you're Pfizer superman.
22852,Aargh.

22860,YOU ARE PART OF THE SPREAD.
22861,QUIT ACTING LIKE YOURE NOT AND YOUR REASONS ARE JUSTIFIED!
22862,You are just a hypocrite.
22863,Are parents actually going to send their kids into a dangerous environment like that?
22864,Specifically the under 12?
22865,I sure wouldn't.
22866,"Most people don't care about kids, either."
22867,"I get downvoted or my comments straight up removed if I respond to people's comments stating they are going maskless because they don't care (either they are anti vaxx or they are tired of the anti vaxxers and ""did their part"" by getting vaccinated and they are over it)."
22868,Kids are getting really sick right now.
22869,I have a special needs son who is high risk.
22870,"We haven't been able to ""ease back into normal"" like everyone else around us has."

22872,I see a dark tunnel with no end in sight.
22873,It's depressing.
22874,"Yes, some vaccinated people who become infected with delta can carry a high viral load and transmit the virus to others very efficiently, unfortunately."
22875,"Hilarious, as this is an example of the government telling people what they can and can’t do."
22876,"Pull your head out, bro."
22877,"
Clearly vaccines alone was not a great plan with Delta coming."
22878,"Now that Delta is here, it is time to admit that was a bad plan and change it."

22898,I agree with stipulations.
22899,"You don't have to be vaccinated, but you shouldn't expect health care if you contract covid."
22900,"If you are unable to be vaccinated because your healthcare physician does not recommend it, or you are too young, or maybe you are young and have anti-vax parents, those are the exceptions."
22901,"Otherwise, why should resources be spent on those individuals when there was a way to lessen symptoms and almost completely avoid them?"
22902,I'm also open to taxes.
22903,Vaccinated individuals have tax deductions as they will weigh down the resources needed less.
22904,Un-vaccinated individuals are taxed a % of their wealth.
22905,"(Investments, income, assets, etc.)"
22906,"If it's a static amount, it just becomes a fee for the rich and burdens the poor."
22907,So make it % based on your entire wealth and increase that % the higher the wealth becomes.
22908,"Then sure, don't be vaccinated and you can get medical assistance."
22909,"He’s says, while open carrying a hand cannon “just in case”"
22910,"It feels like it’s already here, so an extent."
22911,"Well half of the marriages in the US end in divorce, so maybe one half the parents will vaccinate their children."
22912,"No one is talking about eradication, talking about reasonable measures."
22913,You can head in the sand all day if you like won’t change the facts.
22914,"That's why the key guidance is local trends, not individual feelings"
22915,The comment we were all waiting for.
22916,"How tf am I racist I didn’t even mention a single race, also that article is from 6 months ago so it’s not accurate anymore"
22917,"Ahhh, that’s good to know."
22918,"That’s certainly the dogma, but it’s not proof."
22919,Proof would be testing a post-vaccine human for any signs of DNA integration.
22920,That’s not part of this study.
22921,"Okay, what percentage of that population is vaccinated?"
22922,"Of the average 11 deaths per day, how many are kids, adults, seniors, vaxed or unvaxed?"
22923,The thing about statistics is they are a good reference point but can also be miss represented to fit nearly any naritive both good and bad.
22924,I'd be curious to see deaths compared to unvaxed and deaths per vaxed for your county to get a better measure of what's going on.
22925,God dammit I hate this fucking man
22926,"These craven assholes will do anything to stay in power, even kill their own constituents and supporters."
22927,Disgusting.
22928,Sorry for the constant responses here but I find this study really interesting.
22929,I'm not part of the LGBT community but Provincetown is a gay resort town which matches up with the following statement from the CDC report and the fact that 85% of infections were in men.
22930,THIS IS NOT AN ANTI LGBT POST but could explain some of the shocking numbers here.
22931,"**.....demographics of cases likely reflect those of attendees at the public gatherings, as events were marketed to adult male participants."

22933,Thank you.
22934,Of course this comment was buried at the bottom of the thread.
22935,Working conditions suck in the US.
22936,The high salary jobs are very difficult to get into and often are demanding.
22937,"It's not surprising many people will try to chase after a way of living that won't make them as miserable, not that being famous or a social media personality is 100% easy and has no negative sides but compared to many jobs it's still better."
22938,"But to combat so many young people going that direction, they need to be constantly reminded of the small likelihood of success and how much of it requires luck and the right connections."
22939,"You can also pursue a more realistic career path while trying to get famous on the side as opposed to putting all of your eggs, or most, in the basket of trying to get famous."
22940,It was even worse when the 70% rate included those with a single dose.
22941,"Per-capita is the only sensible way to look at this sort of data, and California has about twice the population of Florida."
22942,Also cases always lead hospitalizations which in turn lead deaths.
22943,So the deaths from this July upswing won’t be seen until next month.
22944,"Luckily, they expect a lower ratio of hospitalizations and deaths to new cases this go-around."
22945,Even states with poor overall vaccine coverage still have a pretty good chunk of seniors vaccinated.
22946,"The 1 out of 250 could statistically just as easily have been 2, or 0."
22947,The number of hospitalizations is to low to really be statistically significant.
22948,What is the normal percentage of unvaccinated who end up in hospital?
22949,It cannot possibly be as low as 0.4%
22950,"Some still are, the district doesn't get funding for it, so they will have to pay for it themselves, but at least one is choosing too."
22951,A school district in Austin is choosing to offer online and pay themselves.
22952,Idiotic solutions towards idiotic antivaxxers.
22953,Sounds fine to me.
22954,I hadn’t seen the flu stats.

22963,I would be pretty shocked if it was more than 75% fully vaccinated though.
22964,"Thanks for the useful website,"
22965,Most at risk people are vaccinated.
22966,Majority of unvaccinated people are younger and have a lower risk of hospitalization.
22967,"Also, LA county is huge so the virus may not have spread yet to less vaccinated communities but I don’t have any data on that."
22968,"Lastly, without vaccinations the number of hospitalized pts would be much higher."

22978,"If the article is correct, it's a bit more tricky: ""Abbott's order applies to any government entities receiving state funds, including counties, cities, school districts, public health authorities and government officials."""
22979,"It's technically going to depend on how that clinic is run, could be the county public health clinic."

22987,Thank you so much for your compassion.
22988,My husband and I are both fully vaxxed and live in the Houston area.
22989,"When the pandemic hit, my husband quit his job (I was the higher wage earner so it was our best option) and we massively changed our lifestyle so that we could afford to keep our kids in school virtually."
22990,They have essentially stayed inside our home for the last 16 months and I have been the main one to go out when necessary.
22991,"So far, all 4 of us have managed to not become infected."
22992,"Now this option has been taken away as our district is not offering virtual this year, and we can’t afford to stay on one income much longer."
22993,"Our daughter is 8 and our son, who has severe autism and is non-verbal, is 4."
22994,They both start school on August 11…without any mask mandate in place.
22995,"We are fairly confident that our daughter will keep her mask on throughout the school day, but we have never been able to get our son to wear a mask."
22996,"Hey Governor Abbott, can you please give me some advice on how we should explain “personal responsibility” to our son so that he will wear a mask while in school around dozens of other unmasked, unvaccinated students and adults?"
22997,"We are so desperate that we just signed both kids up for the pediatric vaccine trials, but so far neither of them have been selected."

23006,It seems to me the pro Summer 2021 lockdown crowd have only 3 talking points and there all easily refuted.
23007,(A) BuT wHAt abOUt tHe KIdS?
23008,400 kids in America have died of Covid all time.
23009,That's less than a typical flu season in 3x the time.
23010,"They can either assume the risk or choose to isolate with their family, whichever is best for them."
23011,(B) there are people who legitimately can't get vaccinated.
23012,"Then I'm sorry, but they need to isolate themselves."
23013,Society can't permanently shutdown for the sake of people who could easily protect themselves by just isolating and doing pickup groceries.
23014,"If they can't afford it, government assistance should be provided."
23015,And tbh I really think many people on here exagerrate how many people can't get vaccinated.
23016,(C) but the cases are so HIGH?
23017,who cares....
23018,"I believe only about 1,000 of 162,000,000 vaccinated people have died."
23019,That's a really strong proof that these vaccines work.
23020,Shouldn't deaths be a better metric than cases.
23021,"Unless someone is in category a or b, then they're protected."
23022,"If they aren't, they aren't protected because they decided they'd rather risk Covid than get a shot, which isn't smart, but it's their choice."
23023,No more lockdowns unless something drastically changes.
23024,"to me this is more of an ""overreach of gov"" than a ""mandate"" on NPI's"
23025,"&gt;For the record, in case anyone doesn't quite notice, I have made no subjective assessments as to whether I agree or disagree with any of this."
23026,You didn't need to :)
23027,"Maybe I should file a lawsuit over the states ability to make us wear seatbelts in a car, shoes in a public building, pants and underwear on a public street, or a shirt in church."
23028,Maybe a bunch of women should start going to churches topless and see what they start saying about rights then.
23029,I think its the cases of Mass residents in the outbreak compared to the general population of Mass vaccines.
23030,So those with pfizer vaccines tested positive at a lower rate then their vaccines were put into arms.
23031,Jennsen more likely to test positive and moderna equal.

23060,I took 2 shots of the Moderna MRNA vaccine last year as part of the phase III trials.
23061,Will they work against the Delta variant?
23062,I have been seeing increasing reports of breakthrough infections but I'm not sure which vaccine the Delta variant has broken through.
23063,"10% of side effects, not that they affect 10% of people

&gt;Data published Friday by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention finds that among 8.9 million adolescents vaccinated between December and July, reports of adverse events were received for about 1 per 1,000 vaccines."
23064,"&gt;Overall, 8,383 or 90.7% of reports were for non-serious events and 9.3% were for serious events, including death."
23065,No reports of death were determined to be the result of myocarditis.
23066,I don't think that's a fair comparison.
23067,I used to ride a motorcycle in my spare time and I lived in states that both did and did not mandate helmets.
23068,"I always chose to wear one, but I would much prefer that it be my choice."
23069,"But when I got vaccinated, not only was I protecting myself, but I was protecting others around me whom I might spread the virus to were I not vaccinated."
23070,There is no such equivalence with a motorcycle helmet because a helmet protects only the wearer.

23122,problem is CDC doesn't really know.
23123,"it's all ""estimates"" and i've seen ""estimates"" that actual infections were on the order of X10 what was tested and known?"
23124,there will never be an exact number known.
23125,Sc governor McMaster banned mask mandates and they took down all the plexiglass that they paid millions for and going against federal bus mask mandates .But he’s trying to ban abortions because he cares about lives.

23132,Which still goes with the initial data that the vaccine is about 98-99% effective at preventing hospitalization.
23133,The significant piece of information is the amount of virus a vaccinated person carries with the Delta variant versus the other variants.
23134,The virus has a best friend and it is the Republican Party.
23135,I can see two sides of that.
23136,Scientists willing to use their real names also get death threats and angry letters to their employers.

23186,"There are studies on both sides of it about prior immunity vs vaccination but they appear, from the sum of them, relatively close with the best being a combo of both but this would all go a lot smoother to start with if proof of prior infection was included."
23187,I find it odd that no one talks about it.
23188,I understand you can't have that forever if boosters start to be a thing but natural immunity from prior infection is literally talked about no where.
23189,Like it doesn't exist at all.
23190,I hate how right you are about that.
23191,It's not going to happen.
23192,The amount of people who are sticking to the rhetoric that it was green energy that failed is astounding.
23193,That's what they did here in Idaho.
23194,"Governor was out of state for a conference for like... a single day, and the Lt."
23195,Governor issued a executive order banning mask mandates.
23196,Governor came back the next day and tossed that order in the garbage and said its up to the cities to make that decision.
23197,No it's all over this subreddit.
23198,And my local sub.
23199,I believe the CDC verbiage is currently that masks for all are recommended indoors in areas with high new cases or positive test result ratios.
23200,Whether all are vaccinated or not.
23201,There's a map of areas which are in the danger zone that changes weekly but a conservative approach is to just assume that you will need the habit eventually so you may as well start now.
23202,The new internal CDC document says that the Delta variant is one of the most transmissible viruses known.
23203,It is spreading throughout the population rapidly and is likely to saturate the population rapidly.
23204,The information on the risk maps might not be timely enough to provide adequate warning to mask up so it is better to be on the safe side.
23205,"Masks, even KN95 respirators, are available in designer colors and fashion prints for under a dollar."
23206,"They breathe easily, the respirators protect both you and others."
23207,It's not that costly or inconvenient compared to the downside risk.
23208,[removed]
23209,"Oh, wow - that is pretty interesting."
23210,Compare with Israel planning to give some 3rd Pfizer as a booster and Turkey was giving double Sinovacced people a Pfizer to improve effectiveness.

23227,You cannot fight ideologically driven conspiracies with facts.

23241,Absolutely not.
23242,People are wanting normalcy.
23243,&gt; Vaccine mandates are cruel.
23244,Jesus christ you're off your rocker
23245,Sounds like masks and rolling lockdowns forever
23246,"i mean, as long as government is depriving minorities of things, they can be unlimited!"
23247,I stubbed my toe the day after I got the vaccine and in that moment I swore I'd never get another vaccine again.
23248,That is due to congestion with the common cold.
23249,Covid is affecting the brain and nerves in a way the common cold doesn't.
23250,Not enough data yet on whether the vaccine stops long term covid symptoms from developing.
23251,Mild covid cases still cause long covid in the unvaccinated.
23252,I have hope the vaccines are stopping long covid from developing but we don't know for sure yet.

23295,Its so odd that mask have so much push back but something like the Patriot act just flies  under the radar.
23296,weird fucking world we live in
23297,"It's good news, but not that great."
23298,The UK is sticking to a longer 8 interval in order to maximise overall efficacy.

23300,"The Austin area, 11 Counties serving over 2 million people, has 13 open ICU beds."

23302,"However, we’re already at below the lowest number of beds of this entire pandemics."
23303,"I imagine doubling up on ventilators and building new temporary wards might still be options, but the delta wave probably hasn’t even hit in earnest yet."

23314,"When R0 &gt; 1, you get exponential growth, which with covid seems to happen any time restrictions are relaxed."
23315,"This means that every n days, the new cases double."
23316,"If we start from a small number, it takes some time before things really get rolling, but once they do...  1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, 16384, 32768, 65536, 131072, ...."

23326,"For example, in grade school in Texas, I was taught that slavery was just a small issue compared to the other true causes of the Civil War, and that real historians don't call it the American Civil War, but the ""War of Northern Aggression""."
23327,"Turns out that wasn't true, at all."
23328,"No, for matters of public health, such as required vaccines for children, or masks during a pandemic, we cannot allow school districts to decide."
23329,They should all be deciding to follow the recommendations of our best medical experts.
23330,"No, what we need is for the Texas government to make those determinations, but they need to be based off of actual science."
23331,"You’d feel sympathy for the kids who are long haulers, ok.  
What good does that do them?"
23332,Yes I do feel bad for children who die / have long term issues from any sickness.
23333,I worked for a guy who was severely overweight and unable to partake in physical exercise due to a ravaging that influenza inflicted on his lungs as a child.
23334,He was a normal kid and then BAM!

23336,"That is why vaccines are so important as our first line of defense, and then other mitigation efforts."

23338,Efficacy is calculated by looking at the risk of a vaccinated person versus the risk of unvaccinated person.
23339,"75% vaccinated population , 25% unvaccinated population

75% vaccinated cases, 25% unvaccinated cases

There is no difference between the risk of vaccinated / unvaccinated in this scenario."
23340,"Again I’m not antivax, I’m fully vaccinated."
23341,These are the numbers the cdc reported in the ProvinceTown outbreak.
23342,One of the big differences is that 79 percent of the vaccinated folks in that group turned out to be symptomatic.

23348,I assume similar now.
23349,Of course that might be slow with possible lawsuits
23350,Because your chances of catching and spreading it are greatly reduced.
23351,It is already here a bit.
23352,Look at the places that had mask mandates last year but are not implementing one this year.
23353,"Alabama,Texas,Mississippi,Universal Orlanda,Walmart for customers, and more."
23354,These places all had mask mandates last year but are not implementing one this year.
23355,All of this despite CDC guidance.
23356,because it's what the Republicans bought via money.

23358,Delta was already spreading around the world before Biden even took office.

23360,It was inevitable.
23361,[removed]
23362,It's pretty much just wait until the death and overloaded hospitals convince people to get vaxxed.
23363,We are already seeing another uptick in vaccination.
23364,I'd expect that to continue when people have to face the real consequences of their inaction.
23365,"Masks alone, with no social distancing, barriers, capacity limits, full compliance etc isn't going to do much."
23366,"It will help some and should be encouraged, but I highly doubt it's effectiveness if delta is this much more infectious."
23367,What a nutter.
23368,Father?
23369,"Yes, son?"
23370,"What does ""regret"" mean?"
23371,"Well son, the funny thing about regret is, it's better to regret something you have done, than to regret something you haven't done."
23372,"And by the way, if you see your mom this weekend would be sure and tell her: SATAN!"

23380,I expect to see rising cases in the north east like we did last fall and winter.
23381,It's going to continue with the seasonal pattern for a long long time but will just be part of a yearly thing like the flu with yearly shots.

23384,pro-big government republican!
23385,what’s his view on wheelchair ramps?
23386,Do you know of Hand how many total deaths where they extracted 1141 from.. for instance if total deaths in that period was 5K then this is scarier as opposed to 20K
23387,That’s not a trend that’s an incident and I’m not downplaying it being discouraging due to the fact that people were vaccinated but the numbers of sever cases in the group still align with the effectiveness of the vaccine keeping people out of the hospital and dead.
23388,"Best of luck with your impending Delta infection, new symptoms, more severe illness, and potentially long Covid."
23389,"I too am vax’d but I’m no fool, I’ll take any ticket any agency wants to give me for masking in public."
23390,Close the bars.
23391,Cancel the cruises.
23392,Checking your Facebook was your first mistake.
23393,"I think it's hard for some people, pro-vax or anti-vax, to conceptualize risk mitigation instead of risk avoidance."
23394,"Because there have been more breakthroughs due to the Delta variant, it's weakened the estimation some have had of the vaccine."
23395,I see this all over social media.
23396,The sad part is never-vaxers take this trepidation as proof that it's all been a big lie.
23397,Protection isn't binary.
23398,Some reduction in efficacy is still very good.
23399,"And while prevention is the goal, significantly lower risk of hospitalization and death are worth celebrating."
23400,"We don't want to spread it, but ultimately we don't want to get really sick or die."
23401,That should be the takeaway more than anything else about the vaccine.
23402,"Good luck helping those 45 and the other 1,500 unvaccinated individuals also dealing with covid!"
23403,"Wow, this is depressing."
23404,Same people who would disbelieve in climate change voted for this piece of shit.
23405,"Perhaps, but is there no possibility that they do bad things for the sake of doing bad things (at least, as their main reason)?"
23406,Or why not both?
23407,"Money, *and* sadism."
23408,4/5 people who were hospitalized were vaccinated.

23410,"You undercook fish, believe it or not, power loss."
23411,I'm not letting emotions make my decisions.
23412,I am simply confused.
23413,"You have one CDC study that says the vaccine is very effective against delta, and now you have this."
23414,So which is correct?
23415,"I have no idea, and I'm fine with either answer."
23416,I just would like a concrete answer without speculation.
23417,"The window has closed, think globally not US-centric."
23418,Most of the world has not received a single shot..
23419,Are the hospitals full in Massachusetts from Covid?
23420,If they aren't the vax is working
23421,They’re not?
23422,Code Black usually means a bomb / security threat.
23423,I’ve worked in healthcare for years and learned healthcare color codes are not uniform and are usually regional.
23424,In my area this is would probably fall under Code Yellow (mass influx/casualty).

23445,"&gt;You can’t ban abortion legally

Right."
23446,Because of Rowe V Wade if I'm not mistaken.
23447,"Someone could argue that it would be ""more freedom"" to leave that up to states but I'd argue that being allowed to have an abortion is a freedom that should not be allowed to be impeded."
23448,Same with vaccination.
23449,"No one should be forced to be vaccinated so leaving it up to cities is not ""more freedom"" as some people put it."
23450,Well what’s the solution then
23451,"There was a major confounder at play here that isn't mentioned in the report, but needs to be considered."
23452,https://ptowntourism.com/events/bear-week/
23453,My husband and I are both fully vaxxed and live in Texas.
23454,"When the pandemic hit, my husband quit his job (I was the higher wage earner so it was our best option) and we massively changed our lifestyle so that we could afford to keep our kids in school virtually."
23455,They have essentially stayed inside our home for the last 16 months and I have been the main one to go out when necessary.
23456,"So far, all 4 of us have managed to not become infected."
23457,Now this option has been taken away as our district is not allowed to offer virtual school this year (thanks Abbott) and we can’t afford to stay on one income much longer.
23458,"Our daughter is 8 and our son, who has severe autism and is non-verbal, is 4."
23459,They both start school on August 11…without any mask mandate in place.
23460,"We are fairly confident that our daughter will keep her mask on throughout the school day, but we have never been able to get our son to wear a mask."
23461,"Hey Governor Abbott, can you please give me some advice on how we should explain “personal responsibility” to our son so that he will wear a mask while in school around dozens of other unmasked, unvaccinated students and adults?"
23462,"We are so desperate that we just signed both kids up for the pediatric vaccine trials, but so far neither of them have been selected."

23490,The data is not positive or anything but we are far away from square one.
23491,While bullshit and likely not legal (hopefully we see this resolved in court) people are obviously free to wear masks all they want.

23497,"I have a feeling Delta is prob much more contagious then ppl truly realize, and the vaccinated can just as easily transmit it with ofc much better health outcomes."
23498,But this basically means even with 60% vaccination-rates your unvaccinated population will almost certainly get it and your numbers prob going to be worse then last years peak come winter.

23518,But what about all the vaccinated people having done their part!
23519,"/s, in case needed."
23520,The fact that 72% of the population in Mass is fully vaccinated also protects the smaller proportion of residents who aren’t vaccinated.
23521,We also don’t know the vaccination rates of the control group when the superspreader event happened.
23522,It could have been like 90% vaccinated/10% unvaccinated for all we know.
23523,"Also keep in mind that Pfizer/moderna are 90% effective against Delta, but that also means that twice as many breakthrough infections happen with Delta compared to the original strain."
23524,"Also in P-Town when people are in clubs and close to hundreds of other people, a superspreader can easily infect a dozen + people in a night, even if everyone is fully vaxxed."
23525,Basically vaccines are most effective when everyone is vaccinated.

23599,No.
23600,"That’s not true, unfortunately."
23601,"Anosmia is well understood, or at least measured."
23602,It doesn’t vary a lot based on the virus that caused it.
23603,If your olfactory nerves stop operating after virally-induced inflammation you have about a 12% chance of eventual recovery.
23604,"There is a slim chance that COVID recovery is somehow much better than other viruses, but  COVID is particularly bad for anosmia onset and it would be strange if recovery were better."
23605,I'm so sorry.
23606,I cannot imagine what you're going through.
23607,We have been waiting for new information about the Delta variant to decide and then yesterday's WP article about the CDC slideshow/document basically sealed the deal for us.
23608,I still feel some weird hope that something will change in the next weeks so we haven't unenrolled them.
23609,They update the school district dashboard twice a week and it's a good indicator of what's happening with the schools currently in session.

23636,Yea the more I dig into this the less it makes sense to base a CDC global recommendation on this cases scenario.
23637,Seasonality in the data.
23638,More people get tested during the week than the weekend
23639,For every reason you list it sounds like a no brainer to provide product pick up.
23640,But for Walmart corporate they need to weigh the costs versus revenue versus loss of other revenue.
23641,"When you walk into a store, you have it in mind to purchase X products, but you see additional Y products and make the impulsive purchase to buy Y."
23642,Pick up services prevent impulsive purchases which could result in a greater loss of revenue for a store.
23643,The classic example of impulsive purchases is that Costco sells fully cooked rotisserie chicken for $5 and they take a loss on every chicken they sell.
23644,"There are plenty of people that go to Costco and only buy chicken, but there are enough people that when they go to only buy chicken, end up impulsively buying other products that more than makes up for the loss of selling chicken."
23645,"That whole concept is called a Loss Leader, products are sold at a loss to attract buyers to purchase more profitable items while they are in the store."
23646,"If Costco started doing pick up services and you could get away with only ordering 1 chicken for pick up, they would have a huge drop in revenue; that is one reason many stores have a minimal order amount or charge an extra fee."
23647,So yes Walmart has been providing grocery pick up at select stores for years in select markets for a trial run.
23648,It's only since the pandemic that Walmart has made the decision to expand pick up services to almost every store.
23649,"And you are correct, now that people are using it, it looks like that service will be here for good because the way people shop has changed."
23650,"But there are whole groups of people that don't want to use pick up services, they want to be selective with their fruit, or pick milk with a further expiration date."
23651,"One thing is true, stores are ever adapting to how people shop."
23652,I kind of figured it would be something like that.
23653,He’s still believing the anti vax propaganda.
23654,I told him we wouldn’t be hanging out until he got vaccinated so we’ll see what he does.

23661,"It's based on a UK study, not anything new and not anything using our dosing schedule (3 weeks)."
23662,Immunocompromised people and kids still exist.
23663,"And yes, unmasked vaccinated people are putting them at risk, even more so than unvaccinated people as many of them can be positive and asymptomatic."

23682,"I guess that'll completely change the opinion of some people to get it, though I suppose thats probably a small minority."

23685,It’s nice to hear local news and debate but omg sometimes it’s too much to listen to
23686,The past 3 days that I have been checking COVID stats again California has had 25 deaths a day.
23687,Florida 80+.
23688,So Florida has half the population and 4x the death rate.
23689,Problem is if you read down the masking of vaccinated individuals is more for protection of unvaccinated individuals than self protection.
23690,It would likely be an extraordinarily tough sell to get vaccinated to mask up to protect people willingly avoiding the vaccine.
23691,What a shocker that high school dropouts would have no capacity to understand this.
23692,US covid deaths are at an all time low.
23693,I understand that death is a lagging indicator but so far vaccinations look be doing their job at preventing death.
23694,They don't like limited government if it's limited in ways they don't like.
23695,Otherwise they're all about limited government and oppression.
23696,Why education isn't federally regulated is beyond me.
23697,"At this point, it is a matter of national security."
23698,Our population is so uniformed in science and critical thinking that they would rather die of a preventable illness then listen to a fucking doctor for 5 minutes.
23699,It is insane.
23700,I'm half expecting the next terrorist attack we have to have half the country saying it wasn't so bad and defending the terrorists...
23701,Wait that already happened this year.
23702,Education is so poor right now that it is literally threatening the safety of the whole country.
23703,"Obviously, *cough* entire south east *cough* certain states aren't up to the task of educating their children and haven't been for a long time."

23714,"Sure, just thought the Shakespeare’s Globe-closing-factoid was interesting, which happened in a Bubonic Plague surge and parallels venues closing now."
23715,"With a lowercase “p,” the term “plague” isn’t exactly a scientific one, so I don’t think it’s necessarily “wrong” to refer to our experience with Covid as a plague."
23716,"I can see the semantic connotation of the term referring to the Black Plague, which is what many folks associate the word with, but it doesn’t mean every time someone uses the word that they are saying “This is the Black Plague.” The Black Plague still exists and people still get it."
23717,"They recover a lot better than they did in the 16th century, but it’s still “The Plague.”"
23718,Had a comment after I mentioned my frustration at the possibility of my husband's fertility being affected since we were trying before he got diagnosed with covid.
23719,They asked why we were trying in a pandemic.
23720,It looked like it was deleted after but email alert showed.
23721,"Dunno why it was their business but considering that it takes 9 months (in best case scenarios) and we are slowly on the road to it being an endemic, and after a loss from last year we agreed to try from this summer anyways."
23722,"But no worries, now we have more roadblocks so surely that commenter can breathe in peace that a mere stranger isn't as fertile in a pandemic."
23723,It's what the data and research shows.
23724,At this point I’m wondering the same.
23725,Tbh I’m angry with the CDC for ever even lifting the mask mandate.
23726,The messaging coming from them has been so inconsistent.

23800,At the same time she banned workplaces from requiring the vaccine… she is largely responsible for this.

23802,Full disclosure I’ve been fully vaccinated since March and spent a lot of time trying to convince my family and coworkers to get it.
23803,I assured them it was safe and literally booked appointments for them.

23909,I guess what I am getting at is that before we thought that the viral load in infected individuals who are vaccinated was quite low.
23910,"We are finding that to not be the case, so if you come in contact with an infected person, even if you are both vaccinated, the chance of catching it is much higher than it was with prior variants."

24268,"Anyone who hasn't gotten vaccinated and winds up in the hospital should pay for their treatment themselves and if they have insurance, their insurance should deny their claim if they weren't vaccinated."
24269,I agree but if Faucci says put a mask on....put a mask on
24270,I've cut several people out of my life that won't get vaccinated.
24271,"Not even like people that don't buy the science, people that just won't get it out of laziness."
24272,"The pharmacy at my local grocery store literally has walk-in J&amp;J vaccines for free, I just walked in, filled out some paperwork, they called me when a shipment arrived, got poked and waited 30 minutes to make sure I didn't have a reaction, done."
24273,There's no excuse at this point.
24274,"If people won't get vaccinated when they're perfectly accessible now, those people don't need to be humored anymore."
24275,There's no reason this many people should still be unvaccinated.
24276,NYCer here.
24277,Are your allergies acting up this week too?
24278,Im back on the flonase.
24279,Can’t the federal government make it illegal to make it illegal?
24280,You can still get a girl pregnant if you wear a condom too.
24281,"I wouldn’t, and I really hate the precedent of “vaccines are just another layer of protection now” when they were always meant to be the way out."
24282,It makes forever masks seem more feasible which just makes me feel so fucking hopeless.
24283,So NOW you're about law and order?
24284,Weird.
24285,Hellworld
24286,"""You're gonna get Covid and you're gonna like it!"""
24287,"Yeah, but the old- to middle aged (and recently more and more young) people who make up that kid's cluster have a higher chance to die from the US' leading cause of death."
24288,Because it's contagious.
24289,Why not get the better option?
24290,I dont understand the logic here
24291,"But this isn't a scientific approach either, because it doesn't follow the evidence."
24292,"It is, at best, conjecture entirely unsupported by the evidence at the time."
24293,The vaccines are *not* becoming less effective because the virus is mutating.
24294,What does appear to be happening is that the greater viral load in Delta is causing a great enough level of exposure to vaccinated people that it's increasing their chances of infection.
24295,"Further, one of the benefits of the vaccines was the ability to safely stop wearing a mask."
24296,"This was used in a lot of messaging, like ads from the Department of Health for instance."
24297,Continuing to enforce mask usage among vaccinated people would probably have reduced vaccination rates somewhat.
24298,"The vaccines (especially the mRNA ones) haven't needed to be adjusted *yet* to keep up with any of the current mutations, including Delta."
24299,I'm surprised that people think they're doing a better job of following the science just because they lean towards worst-case scenarios.
24300,Fucking repubs turned this shit into another front for the culture war and are now surprised their constituents are choking on fluid.
24301,Doubly hilarious because they pride themselves on not changing their minds.
24302,&gt; I honestly do not understand why insurance companies are not enforcing higher premiums for those who are not vaccinated.
24303,Does stupidity count as a preexisting condition?
24304,but it is approved in Canada to have a mix of any vaccines based on public research.
24305,Not a phase 3 trial made by and for privately owned Pharma company who wouldn't see any good to mix their vaccine with another brand and lose some sales.
24306,It could even be better to take the strenght of each vaccines type.

24313,"Lmao what did you ever do for them to be do ""done with them""?"
24314,?
24315,My friend in Denver drove 3 hours to a conservative town in Coloroda for his since there was wide open availability there months ago.
24316,"I'm sorry, I'm not following these data."
24317,Does the NHS have graphs like the CDC one I liked above showing infections per population and hospitalizations?
24318,"Of course, if everyone is getting sick (see Oklahoma), then more kids will get sick proportionally."
24319,That's why it's so important for adults to get vaxxed until the kids can too.
24320,Friend is an ICU nurse here in Manhattan who was exclusively COVID for about a year.
24321,He currently has 0 COVID patients in his unit.
24322,It reassures me that while cases are increasing we will not have a repeat of last year.
24323,"Well I spoke to a couple employees I know personally since I used to work there and they all said they think it’s BS since they got vaccinated, and I can’t really blame them I understand the frustration"
24324,"From what I’ve been reading (sorry on mobile and not easy to link stuff), seems that if you have Covid, even as a vaccinated person, you can spread to others (vax or unvaccinated)."
24325,It’s made me rethink summer hangouts for now but I’m just as curious how it’ll play out as we all gain more information around it.
24326,"&gt; Also as recent data shows, vaccinated can still share the viral load, so get vaccinated for others arguments falls flat

The news was that infected vaccinated people are significantly more likely to spread the virus than previously thought."
24327,"But we still believe the vaccine significantly decreases the change of getting infected in the first place, so vaccinated people are still significantly less likely to spread the virus."
24328,(And the vaccine still *greatly* decreases the chance of severe illness.)
24329,"&gt;“I wouldn’t be surprised if, on the whole, we’re infecting up to a million people a day right now, and we’re just picking up maybe a 10th of that or less than a 10th of that,” the former Food and Drug Administration commissioner said

That seems incredibly high when the [CDC estimates](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/cases-updates/burden.html) we've detected 1 in 4 cases, and that includes spring 2020 where very little testing was being done."
24330,Misleading data.
24331,Slides from Ferrer's PC show that 120 vaccinated people were hospitalized this week in LA.
24332,Out of maybe 300 new hospitalizations total.
24333,Not good.
24334,What's the time frame for that now?
24335,A couple of days since exposure?
24336,More?
24337,"Nah, masks will flatten the curve but unless those unvaxxed people use the time it buys to get vaccinated they're gonna catch it and pass it to some vaxxed people anyway."
24338,"Masks dont stop anything, they just slow it down."
24339,"Unless you expect 10s of millions to change their mind on vaccination, masking will just delay the inevitable."
24340,So we know that proximity to viral carriers of COVID-19 is one of the largest indicators of spread.
24341,"So let’s take a grand look at the population densities of Texas and California, and also take a city by city look at the actual densities:

California Population Density: 251.3 people per square mile

Texas Population Density: 109.9 people per square mile

&amp;nbsp;

Also some figures for major city population density in Texas:

* Dallas Population Density: 3965 people per square mile

* Houston Population Density: 3630 people per square mile

* Austin Population Density: 3162 people per square mile

Now for California major cities:

* Los Angeles Population Density: **8495 People per square mile**

* San Francisco Population Density: **18562 people per square mile**

* San Diego Population Density: 4381 people per square mile

* San Jose Population Density: 5677 people per square mile

* Sacramento Population Density: 5376 people per square mile

All of a sudden, Texas tracking 77% of California’s infection rate and 83% of California’s death rate doesn’t look as rosy of a picture as you make it out to be."
24342,"Especially when California has over twice the population density, and major California cities having as much as **5 times** the population density as the largest cities in Texas."
24343,"If anything, it shows how utterly terrible Texas has done in respect to California in containing COVID-19."
24344,"Yup, a lot of Americans abroad returned to get it as well."
24345,Honeywell has some on Amazon that fit smallish faces
24346,When did the US declare the War on COVID?
24347,"“Limited” government, limited IQ."
24348,That has to be criminal in some way.
24349,It HAS to.
24350,I can't believe that any of our leaders are this... this... malicious.
24351,He waited til the ICU beds in the whole state were full before declaring a state of emergency.
24352,"CDC is full of shit, you know when youre supposed to wear mask?"
24353,when youre fucking sick.
24354,Always has been.
24355,"All this fucking hype of 200,000 a day."
24356,We already at the peak.
24357,Numbers already going down.
24358,What are they going to do when numbers go down?
24359,reverse the mask policy?
24360,Government is full of narcissistic control freaks.
24361,WTF.
24362,And theyre hyping this up like it was like before when their were so many deaths.
24363,Like GTFO already.
24364,"Also buried in this CDC report: [88% effective against all symptomatic infection](https://twitter.com/astoraaron/status/1421102316539846656?s=21)

But no one will bring that up!"
24365,Then why is China (and likely Russia) producing non-MRNA vaccine when a superior form is available?
24366,For now
24367,I can respect that!
24368,"Mask mandates for bars and nightclubs or concerts is a no go for me, but I can understand why someone would not mind seated show mask mandates."
24369,"Still, I would rather just wait until they are mask free personally."
24370,"It depends entirely on the cloth, how many layers there are, and how well it fits."
24371,I've got a cloth mask with two woven layers and a fluffier material in between.
24372,It's got a pipe-cleaner to pinch the nose and straps that go behind my head.
24373,It works so well that I thought I might have Covid because I couldn't smell the smoke when I stepped outside with it on.
24374,I took it off and realized *instantly* that my cloth mask was protecting me very well indeed.
24375,"Thanks for the personal story, I’m sure it applies to everyone, everywhere."
24376,I can see you’re a true intellectual.
24377,Enjoy your slippery slope and subscription plan to health.
24378,"I’m just going to do what I want, and you do what you want."
24379,Can confirm.
24380,Individuals under 18 are not allowed to donate blood.
24381,"Also, elderly above 75 years of age rarely donate either."
24382,So the numbers are a bit skewed.
24383,"There's cities and businesses in fl that basically told the state to stuff it, they're requiring masks anyway."
24384,This is bs.
24385,This report shows that our situation is very different now from what it was just weeks ago.
24386,We need to adjust our thinking and our behavior and that starts with education.
24387,Nobody likes what that report is saying but we all need to understand what it means.
24388,"Well because of our broken wage system, almost every family has to have both parents work full time to afford to survive."
24389,"In that case, no, most people can’t pull their kids out for home school."
24390,"In some cases, one parent’s wages goes entirely to childcare since no one can be home to watch the kids."
24391,Especially in summer or with kids who are less than 6.

24393,He knows the red towns aren't going to mandate masks anyway.
24394,He wants to stop the blue towns from doing it so the red town numbers don't look as bad in comparison.
24395,This is literally just so it can spread in the blue areas too
24396,First and only upvote in this thread actually lol.
24397,"I think you’re a little stupid, but relative to anti-vaxxers you’re a certified brain genius."
24398,I wonder if higher vaccination across the pond played a role in it as well.
24399,They also had an earlier start on us with the Delta becoming dominant iirc.
24400,I’d say we do have another month or so before it falls but that’s a very rough guess.
24401,Vaccine doesn't stop transmission.
24402,You're protected from severe illness though
24403,There is just so much shit it’s doing right now.
24404,The abortion and education legislation really is the top of the list for me personally.
24405,"That’s just inexcusable, and people have been saying Texas is “probably going blue next election” since 2008."
24406,That’s plenty of time for it to have happened by now.
24407,I just don’t think it’s happening.
24408,Not before the conservative faction gets truly desperate and straight up does something to stay in power forever.
24409,What exactly is the endgame of killing your own constituents?
24410,Doesn't seem like a very good strategy.

24433,"Crazy the difference a few percentage points, or less, in an election can make at the national level as well as state and city."
24434,Something feels off about taking advice from a furry.
24435,It’s too stressful to freak out over every new development when the initial reports are often based on incomplete data and since the virus is so new.
24436,And often the experts disagree initially.
24437,I try to wait out the freak out portion and give it a few weeks.
24438,Delta may end up peaking very quickly.
24439,We don’t know for certain.
24440,So the solution is misinformation from the authorities?
24441,"I don’t like to wish ill will against people, but this guy needs to learn a lesson"
24442,"yeah unfortunately I'm guessing everyone is just plain going to get this, whether they get sick is partially lottery and partially lifestyle."
24443,That was probably always going to happen as this virus may never be completely killed off - unless it runs out of things to infect.
24444,"Anecdotal, but I know a couple who both tested positive, one was bed ridden, the other went and worked the fields since they didn't even know they were sick."
24445,I see what you mean and I felt the same when I heard.
24446,My decisions moving forward will be based more on my personal safety (I have mental health issues and I'm not jazzed about the possibility of cognitive degradation) and the local hospitalization rates.
24447,Just because kids might be relatively unscathed by it doesn't mean the secondhand effects of not having other hospital services won't.
24448,"So, uh...do it for the kids?"
24449,The proper framing will get us through this.
24450,God willing.
24451,Yes.
24452,Reason is AL doesn’t educate their citizens properly to make informed decisions based on science.
24453,A very large portion of the unvaccinated in Alabama are POC.
24454,Still think it’s cool that so many are sick?
24455,People with the vaccine are spreading it just like the unvaccinated.
24456,the gamble to incentivize getting the jab to be able to remove your mask has flopped.

24518,"Nine of the new cases reported were part of a factory cluster in Chiayi County, said Health and Welfare Minister Chen Shih-chung (陳時中), who also heads the CECC, at its daily press briefing."
24519,"The cluster so far involves eight workers and two of their family members, a relatively sizable outbreak given the factory's small size, which indicates that the virus could have been circulating there for a while, Chen said."

24523,"In the meantime, people who may have come in contact with the confirmed cases or been exposed to the cluster were quarantined for tests, he said."

24533,Yes.
24534,This guy is a hard right misinformation peddler.
24535,Serious question - is my risk of contracting and exhibiting symptoms still low if I am fully vaccinated?
24536,Shutdown Facebook
24537,Lol no I said it weird.
24538,They left AMA.
24539,I wrote this after working and my brain was sleeping
24540,And in normal times people walk around everywhere with snot coming down their noses.
24541,"Again, if I’m protected why do I care?"
24542,If those don’t want to get vaccinated then so be it.
24543,Thanks!
24544,The built-in system of filtering sensationalised and biased articles is pretty good though.
24545,"I’ve yet to see anything that really gets upvoted and awarded that had comments pointing out that it was misleading or straight-up fabrication, which cannot be said for Facebook in the slightest."
24546,This is why I resent places like NYC even considering mask mandates again when it's clear a huge part of our country isn't just doing nothing - they are actively trying to ruin it for everyone.
24547,"Let us live in our vaccinated, low COVID-rate bubble, and keep the people from these places (eg."
24548,Texas) out of our establishments.

24550,"Honestly, tons of people have done movies, zoos, even whole concerts while masked."
24551,It’s not as good as the before-times but we’re resilient and we adapt.
24552,"&gt; It should be a concern not because there's severe disease to vaccinated people (very very rare)

&amp;#x200B;

I guess that depends on what you consider to be ""very very rare."""
24553,"At 95% efficacy against severe cases, that means that a vaccinated person has 1/20th the chance of a severe case compared to an unvaccinated person."
24554,[removed]
24555,It’s ok I understand.
24556,My understanding is a 3 fold decrease means you have a third of the chance of catching it compared to someone who is unvaccinated.
24557,So (100 - 33.33) = 66.67% efficacy

24845,"](https://www.npr.org/sections/coronavirus-live-updates/2021/05/06/994287048/new-study-estimates-more-than-900-000-people-have-died-of-covid-19-in-u-s)

Worldwide, the study's authors say, the COVID-19 death count is nearing 7 million, more than double the reported number of 3.24 million."
24846,"You're ignoring the facts, in favor of your opinion, that is an all or nothing situation."
24847,"You completely ignore my statement for hybrid models, to keep transmission low, and keep people safe."
24848,"Masks, smaller class size, etc...

You're disingenuously pretending you care about people, and children, while completely ignoring rising transmission factors."
24849,No one wants this to be this way.
24850,"Looking at this intelligently, and keeping safety measures in place is essential."
24851,I thought death only happened in 1% of cases even before vaccination?
24852,I don’t feel as if the crowd as old as you think.
24853,"As a 30 year old, friends my age regularly bring up “did you see X on Facebook” but never ask if I saw something on a news channel."
24854,"People my age do not watch news channels, all of their news comes from Facebook."
24855,I have a degree in statistics and work as an analyst - I'm well aware of how this works.
24856,"Claiming that you can hide a spike or trends with an average is absolutely incorrect unless you are looking for something like a 3-day ""spike"" - which is basically irrelevant when talking about long term trends."
24857,"There's a reason almost all meaningful Covid reporting uses rolling, weekly averages and not daily fluctuations."
24858,They only hate it when it asks for consideration and accountability.
24859,"If Texas introduced legislation saying it was mandatory to own at least 30 firearms by 2022, they'd be all for it here I think."
24860,"My brilliant company has decided to move and give us new office cubes with *shoulder high walls* for ""increased collaboration"" or some other BS."
24861,I have multiple coworkers that refuse to get vaccinated and are traveling and going on vacation like nothing is wrong yet I'm expected to return to office.
24862,lol...hell no!
24863,I really wish the government would mandate WFH for those of us that simply don't want to work physically next to stupid.
24864,😫
24865,"I mean, yeah?"
24866,"At this point, yeah it is."
24867,"Two weeks into the pandemic, with no other means of protecting yourself?"
24868,Masks were absolutely worth it.
24869,"Going into December, my tolerance was wearing a bit thin."
24870,"But vaccines weren’t available yet, and we were in the middle of a surge, so they were absolutely still worth it."
24871,"But now we’re a year and a half into this thing, and I’ve been fully vaccinated for months."
24872,Masking doesn’t do anything for me.
24873,"An inconvenience, no matter how mild, is only tolerable so long as there is a benefit from that inconvenience."
24874,I am vaccinated; there is no benefit to masking.
24875,I was looking for this comment.
24876,*facepalm*
24877,[removed]
24878,Fair enough but if the vaccine gives me good odds against the delta variant (like getting the flu shot but it isn't a perfect match for the strain out that year) what makes it any different?
24879,"So, like Lucky from King of the Hill."
24880,Only even skeevier
24881,If my friend got a J&amp;J and would it be ok if they received another 2 shots of an mRNA vaccine?
24882,&gt;So the key stats is really how many hospitalized people are vaccinated?
24883,I absolutely agree that this is the important stat for *most* public policy measures.
24884,But we still need to understand more about this virus and how it's transmitted.
24885,"Turning a blind eye on uncomfortable data isn't helpful and, as we're seeing right now, it ends up contributing to an atmosphere of distrust."
24886,"I've definitely had the same thought, that we're all bound to get it sooner or later."
24887,I've even (briefly) considered just tossing off all my precautions and allowing myself to get it.
24888,But then I remind myself that I don't want to be a vector.
24889,I don't want to be responsible for somebody else's illness.
24890,"If I'm going to get it sooner or later, my vote is for later when there are better treatments available."
24891,Oh I didn’t mean it that way.
24892,I think Abbott is being a hypocrite and using a big government approach.
24893,I just thought that the person who commented was also trying to claim anti-big government and that’s why Abbott is in the wrong.
24894,But they clearly are pro-big government because they support mask mandates and/or any major restriction that they personally agree with.
24895,So then everyone got triggered by my comment lol.
24896,I guess big government is ok if you agree with it

24902,Oh well that’s not surprising
24903,[removed]
24904,Not OP.
24905,One reason this virus is a concern is that the rate of infected requiring hospitalization is high enough that during outbreaks hospital capacity is strained.
24906,"In LA last winter COVID wards popped up in hospital gift shops and car parks, for example, and in India earlier this year there were massive shortages of medical equipment such as oxygen tanks."
24907,That so few people ended up in hospital during this particular outbreak (indeed that none died when you might expect 2-4) is to say that the vaccines still offer a means to reduce hospitalizations (and death) and thus also a solution to one of the major logistical problems (providing care to the ill) of the pandemic.
24908,Totally no red tide to see here either everyone come to beach!
24909,Thank you for noticing!
24910,It is horrible outside the daily thread.

24952,That's not reassuring.
24953,&gt; But I’ve heard that that number may be waaaay higher as we are only testing breakthrough that lands in the hospital.
24954,"I had cold like symptoms this week, I got tested and it was negative."
24955,"Are you saying it was positive, the CDC wouldn't count that as breakthrough?"
24956,The urgent care facility that did my test asked me if and when I was vaxxed so they certainly had the correct information to report if I was breakthrough or not.

24996,This metric is meaningless btw.
24997,"Heart disease kills a comparable amount as war time deaths *each year*, though it is almost never expressed in those terms."
24998,Put another way - death from disease has almost always been higher than deaths from war.
24999,This isn’t a state law.
25000,It’s an EO.
25001,Sadly they will probably be staying at walmart.
25002,This only applies to corporate employees and not the regular ground staff.
25003,The ground staff just get to be forced back into masks while dealing with 1000 unvaccinated maskless customers all day
25004,Is it THAT big of a difference though?
25005,"The stats I see are:

Fully vaccinated, 57% vs 49%, and for partially, 70% vs 57%."
25006,"Definitely a difference, but do you expect the UK vs US trajectories to be THAT different from ~10% difference?"
25007,"I fully expect the US to be worse, but not catastrophically worse."
25008,I know.
25009,It’s stupid.

25024,"Cool, thanks!"
25025,I wasn't sure since they're only EUA but I guess it's considered within the employer's rights to mandate them anyway.
25026,The main symptoms in vaccinated people are a little different then standard covid symptoms.
25027,"The top 5 most common: 

- Headache

- Runny nose

- Sneezing

- Sore throat

- Loss of smell"
25028,"Whoa what the (here’s the link: https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/health/2021/07/29/covid-19-alzheimers-brain-condition-infection-long-haulers-dementia/5405461001/ )

Apparently it’s just a study as of right now, but there is lingering possibility of dementia development in the future among infected individuals"
25029,But you can't make an accurate conclusion based on that.
25030,There is no way to determine efficacy without knowing demographics of the population.
25031,What if everyone there was under 12?
25032,Then the vaccination rate would be zero.
25033,What if they were over 90?
25034,Then it would be over 90%.
25035,"This data is not useful for vaccine efficacy, it tells a story about something that can happen but it is not statistically useful beyond that"
25036,And yet you still do it.
25037,So why not be a patriot and stop wearing pants?
25038,"No, you comply."
25039,Proving my original point.
25040,Thanks.
25041,I am vaxxed so there is that.
25042,The current vaccines are NOT fda approved.
25043,They are given under an emergency approval with a lot of leeway to companies if things go awry.
25044,"All the vax on that list have been used for decades, approved by independent bodies, and subject to a rigourous approval process."

25058,I've been on vacation this week but before the cdc changed guidelines people wearing masks dropped drastically in North Fort Worth.
25059,I'm currently in Galveston and MAYBE 1 in 10 are wearing masks indoors.
25060,I'd wager 1 in 20 honestly.
25061,Really hoping to see better numbers when I get back.
25062,"I dont disagree with that, the vaccine does appear to help prevent bad outcomes."
25063,However that same research seems to indicate you’re gonna get covid even with a vaccine and it’s going to be a roll of the dice what your outcome is.
25064,"While death and hospitalization are bad, I also don’t think anyone is/should looking forward to flu symptoms and/or long term effects."
25065,That’s my overall question.
25066,It seems like at this point you’re going to get it and you just have to accept it and hope for the best.
25067,I can’t see how you can avoid something more contagious than the cold that everyone gets every year.
25068,We wish they were rushing
25069,To a lesser extent.
25070,"FFS, don't you understand the importance of details?"
25071,A small % still takes a massive ding on patient care.
25072,"These people are getting worked like dogs, and now people are leaving due to mandates."
25073,Its only gonna stress the already stressed system.
25074,"You’d need to control for age and other factors, right?"
25075,"If older people were a disproportionately small percentage of those infected, for instance, then it would make sense that most of the people hospitalized were older etc."
25076,I’d want to see how that data stacks up compared to the demographic breakdown of the group.
25077,"Texans don't vote for individuals, we vote for capital letters."
25078,"Cool, I literally don't care."
25079,If people get the virus from me they made their choice by not getting vaccinated.
25080,No that’s not true.
25081,They were worried it might happen but it didn’t
25082,I appreciate that science doesn’t move at the same speed as the 24 hour news cycle.
25083,That’s not my complaint.
25084,"My complaint is that the CDC often seems to claim that things are safe, then finds themselves having to backtrack when new data comes out."
25085,"I would expect a public health agency to err on the side of caution, but the CDC has repeatedly been bitten by a lack of caution."
25086,And the distressing part is that they just did it again.
25087,They don’t seem to be learning from their mistakes.
25088,"It appears (from my perspective) that the CDC is rushing to re-open things for short-term economic reasons, which has repeatedly caused people to act recklessly, and has prolonged the pandemic."
25089,"There are departments that would be better suited to worry about the economy, such as the commerce department."
25090,Public health agencies should concern themselves with public health.
25091,They should report the science.
25092,"And when a public health agency repeatedly errs on the side of economic growth, which has nothing to do with their mission, it gives the appearance of political interference."
25093,Yeah that worked out great in Brazil

25159,"1, 8, 64, 512, 4096, 31768...."
25160,"The fact that they gave probably the absolute worst case example of the beach party, (those stats are probably way higher than actual (didn't they say 75% of those infected were vaccinated?)."
25161,All people hear is 75% of vaccinated people will still get covid and still spread it just as easily as not being vaccinated.
25162,"Like you, I'm as hopeless as ever."
25163,No endgame in sight.
25164,"No more ""once we have a vaccine"" goal to ateast give us hope."

25167,"They will.justify it by saying ""see what happened in May when we lifted them?""."

25174,hi!
25175,thanks for this.
25176,"This seems to confirm Fauci's declarations, masks seems necessary with Delta variant, even if you are vaccinated, in order to protect youself and the others, sad but true."
25177,"Probably you have a lot of cases in vaccinated ones because a lot of people change their approach with life &amp; virus, after vaccination ."
25178,"However It's important that vaccines seems protect against severe illnes, in the majority of cases"
25179,"I'm all for requiring proof of vaccination, but masks as well?"
25180,"If the entire audience is vaccinated, why do they need masks?"
25181,Smart.
25182,"This should be every school in the country, including public schools for ages that can get the vaccine."
25183,Absolutely.
25184,"The vaccine helps mitigate the symptoms because their bodies are not adequately fighting off the virus, meaning they still spread it."
25185,FDA approval makes no legal difference.
25186,That precedent was already set with failed lawsuits against some healthcare systems that mandated it.
25187,There’s this sense that long term covid risks are somehow elusive or hard to quantify and therefore it’s not worth worrying about them or that worrying about them leads to obsession/madness or whatever.
25188,"I don’t agree with that, it seems to me there are discrete specific questions about what covid does to your body long term and how vaccines modulate this risk, and it’s reasonable to want answers to those questions before making decisions about when the pandemic is “over.” I never agreed to this consensus that the instant vaccination occurs and death/hospitalization was mitigated that a light switch was flipped and the risks were eliminated overnight."
25189,"I spent the entire pandemic more focused on avoiding long covid than death, frankly."
25190,And I’d still like to get those answers.
25191,"The problem with focusing on vaccination right now is that it's too late to make a difference, at least in many places."
25192,"If everyone got their first dose today, we would still have five weeks of rising cases and overflowing hospitals."
25193,Masking offers a more immediate benefit.
25194,"If people started wearing masks now, it could help reduce cases in the next few weeks."
25195,"Despite that, I agree that having guidance change leads to people ignoring it, even if it's changing for good reasons."

25210,I’m not aware of the exact date of Deltas mutation.
25211,Can you please provide a source?
25212,To the best of my knowledge it emerged in India and was largely publicized in April.
25213,13 months after it impacted us in the US.
25214,Excuse me?
25215,The vaccines still prevent serious illness and hospitalizations and death very effectively even with Delta!
25216,I must’ve confused Florida.
25217,Or I’m just wrong.
25218,My bad.
25219,"This is still concerning though:

“prohibiting cities and other government entities in the state from enacting vaccine requirements or mask mandates to protect against the coronavirus, even as the virus's more contagious delta variant drives another surge in covid-19 cases in Texas.”

25244,It’s highly reduced spread among those vaccinated and that’s not my opinion that’s in the data.
25245,US social culture has absolutely not kept up with modern science on infectious disease control and prevention.
25246,Masks should absolutely be a given if you feel like you may have been exposed to an infectious disease or might be coming down with something and have to go into public.
25247,Staying home from work or school when sick should be not just tolerated but rewarded.
25248,If you can't run your business without sick people being at work you need to re-evaluate your management abilities and business model.
25249,"Dismissing everything as ""allergies, so not contageous"" and ""just suck it up"" should be eliminated from our public discourse."
25250,It's been proven over and over and over that sick people working in public is worse and more expensive than generous sick day benefits.

25252,It's still somewhat useful.

25254,It won't be a game changer but we shouldn't reject the good simply because it's not perfect.

25264,"If you have a highly vaccinated group that is tightly packed together, you're bound to have skewed numbers like this."
25265,What about the x number of people who *didn't* get it?
25266,All of the data I have seen thus far shows the vaccines are especially effective at greatly reducing your chances of severe symptoms and death.
25267,That should be enough for people to get it.
25268,It's not some magic bubble.
25269,Our local hospital system (city of 300k) 99% of those in the hospital under the age of 50 with COVID are unvaccinated.
25270,93% over the age of 50 are unvaccinated with one of the 7% that's vaxxed having only 1 shot.

25490,2016 election.
25491,But how does that compare against other states’ breakthrough rates?
25492,There might be factors that we aren’t seeing in this data and it is just one data point.
25493,CDC could be trying not to sound the alarms and cause another screeching halt to society and are thus downplaying things and crossing their fingers.
25494,Texas
25495,"&gt; and all the while the Governor's Mansion has been closed since March 2020

Same in Tallahassee."
25496,It is a big vacation spot and people should be informed.
25497,RIP.
25498,"The US has about 330 million people, 48 million of whom are under 12."
25499,Google tells me that 189.5 have at least one dose and 163.6 million are fully vaccinated.
25500,That leaves about 92 million people in the US who have not received any covid vaccinations despite being eligible.
25501,"Reminder with these types of headlines, this is not a binary thing."
25502,So 85% unvaccinated does not mean 15% fully vaccinated.
25503,"&gt; Completely vaccinated patients accounted for 7% of admission

So in other words, 93% of people were not fully vaccinated."
25504,"Falls in line with study, after study, after study."
25505,Relevant username?
25506,Seems like just yesterday we were debating opening schools last year.
25507,What state?
25508,I would fight like hell to get a mask mandate for schools if I had no choice but to send my kids.
25509,Ironically most of the executive orders for and against masks are on very shaky legal ground.
25510,"Without passing a law from the legislative system mask mandates aren't actually enforceable, and any dispute that makes it to court can pretty easily be shot down."
25511,Mask mandates generally exist to inconvenience.
25512,"Governors really aren't mean to be able to make declarations like this outside a state of emergency, and historically those have never lasted more than a few weeks, not well over a year."
25513,My…God!

25515,Just an awesome 5G connection
25516,You can’t have facts here.
25517,Florida man bad.
25518,Is it possible you got a false positive?
25519,So what?
25520,"I don't recall anyone claiming that the vaccines would prevent infection, just that it would greatly reduce the chances of serious illness, hospitalization and death."
25521,Which they in fact do.
25522,Vaccines are not magic shields that make you completely immune to things.
25523,How do all these men claim Christianity and yet they have to experience it like a bunch of doubting Thomas’s before they believe it can happen to them?
25524,"“They honor Me with their lips, but their hearts are far from Me.”"
25525,"Tam has literally been wrong at every step of the pandemic, Canada overall has given first doses to 70% of the population and almost 60% are fully vaccinated, and we’re still almost vaccinating 1% of the population a day, it will be a casedemic, but they’ll probably use that as an excuse to enact another 6 month curfew."
25526,The study literally says that the data is not sufficient to draw conclusions about the effectiveness of the vaccine.
25527,"It *could* be that this is the case, but more data would need to corroborate that."
25528,"Shhhhh, just lay back and let it happen."
25529,The herd is culling itself.
25530,Not surprised when about 70% of the country is fat or disgustingly fat.
25531,Turns out you’re more likely to die of ALMOST EVERY DISEASE if you’re obese.
25532,No one wanted to talk about this last year either.
25533,"If the USA had an average BMI closer to that of China I bet we’d have 80% fewer deaths, but that’s just me talking out my ass from what I saw in the hospital."
25534,"The top 3  most infectious COVID19 states in the country are California, Texas, and Florida and Gov Abbot wants to prohibit mask-wearing and vaccines"
25535,Delta specifically?
25536,We have data on this.
25537,"It appears that long COVID is somewhat less prevalent in vaccinated people, but it still happens in about 20% of breakthrough delta infections."
25538,Driving is more dangerous and it's not even close.
25539,"In the US, there have been around 1,400 breakthrough deaths."
25540,Figure that's over a period of 6 months.
25541,"Extrapolate that out over a year and that's 2,800 deaths."
25542,"There are over 30,000 car accident fatalities each year."
25543,People do so many things that are riskier without thinking twice about it.
25544,Serious question: is chickenpox airborne though?
25545,"I saw that Ebola was mentioned but from what I understood, Ebola was transmitted via bodily fluids."
25546,"If chickenpox was not airborne, isn't this comparing apples to oranges or at least apples to pears?"

Hah is this a typo?"
25559,It works both ways so I can't tell.
25560,Where are you seeing that total cases == exposed?
25561,"There were a significant portion of people that did not test positive, you are aware of that, right?"
25562,"The population of PTown in the summer is 60K, and it is not a large location - 17 square miles, most of which is conservation land."

25564,Not tested?
25565,[removed]
25566,"It's amazing how so many people that claim they would fight and die for the country, are unwilling to get a shot or wear some fabric on their noses for their country."
25567,"So since I've been fully vaccinated, I've gone back to hanging out at my local bar which I didn't do from Jan 2020-March 2021."
25568,"I spend nearly all my time out on the patio but I'm thinking it's time to go back into isolation, basically."
25569,How risky is one last hurrah tonight?
25570,Thanks friend.
25571,"Reddit is the only social media that I partake in, but I could probably use a healthy dose of putting it down more often."
25572,"I am just surrounded by people (family and coworkers) who are either anti vax, Q conspiracy people, or a combo of those and it’s getting exhausting."
25573,I also find it hard to have faith even if it is just the system raising broken people - because it’s a bunch of people making decisions knowing they will hurt others without any regard for that.
25574,"Idunno sorry for the rant I just can’t, as a logical and compassionate person, understand any of this."
25575,"It seems possible but can’t be so sure — remember Sweden, parts of Brazil, and parts of America/Europe thought to have hit herd immunity previously, only to have subsequent waves?"
25576,"The data on Pfizer from Israel (decline in antibodies) —if proven true— is also coinciding with delta, so if antibodies are declining 6 months post vaccination, folks vaccinated very early on could be more susceptible."

25578,I know damn well you have seen the explanations as to why what you are saying is pure stupidity.
25579,"I know for a fucking fact you have seen someone list off all the reasons why ""just let them be"" is a *problem*."
25580,"Yet after you have been made aware of why your view is wrong, you  continue to hold it."

25582,"I am an independent who leaned R. 
Did NOT vote for fake tan douche and never would."
25583,I am pretty firmly in the D camp at this point because I’m thoroughly disgusted with the verbal diarrhea pouring out of the majority of Republicans mouths.
25584,I don’t do insane.
25585,"It's more deadly than the regular strain so unvaccinated people are about to get stacked up like never before, don't you get it?"
25586,"If 2/3rds of Indians have antibodies it means Delta blew through more than 900,000,000 people in a few months and killed ten times the official tally."
25587,"The excess deaths in India suggest the number of people killed by covid is around 4 million, not 400k."
25588,We're fucked.
25589,This is already happening here in Missouri and Alabama.
25590,"Well, I'm all for not catching it."
25591,And I'll wish you and yours good luck too.
25592,You believe that infecting other people in public is ok?
25593,I’m not sure what you’re trying to say.
25594,FTFY.
25595,What makes this extra silly is that the same people who donate to medical gofundmes are the same ones who oppose universal health care 😕
25596,This new information is why we're seeing mandates come into play.
25597,"As of June 2, 79% of adults in Mass had at least one dose."
25598,Reasonable to assume they had their second dose by now.
25599,"Given this particular population in the study, it is completely reasonable that they could be vaccinated at a higher than average for the state."
25600,[removed]
25601,Is the vaccine only a proactive measure?
25602,Is there any data that shows those with symptoms receiving a 1st dose and recovering?
25603,Oh ya?
25604,Where’s your evidence for that?
25605,Is India a western country?
25606,Have ya'll tried shooting it?
25607,There are a bunch of wealthy folks who did see their wealthy grow during the pandemic.
25608,so...maybe?
25609,"Not really, the obvious truth here is that vaccines work WHEN people actually get them."
25610,Unfortunately vaxxed and unvaxxed share public spaces together and we fucking have to do this to accommodate them even as many of them are down to literally kill us (I was attacked for wearing a mask a few weeks ago and that's when I lost patience lol).
25611,Of course many unvaccinated people will make the point you're making.
25612,"After derailing the vaccination campaign they will turn around and use people masking up to protect them from their own bad decision as evidence of ""see told you they don't do anything!"""
25613,I don't really buy into this idea that changing guidelines confuses them either.
25614,"That sounds like WIILFUL ignorance to me, not genuine confusion."
25615,Anyone who isn't being willfully stupid could tell you guidelines change because the situation changes.
25616,It's a completely bad faith argument.
25617,I'm 100% down for a vaccine passport system.
25618,Fuck it.
25619,"We've already shut down everything before in the name of public health, when we have to do it again let the responsible ones not waste another year of their lives while the real public health hazard (not taking the vaccine) has a real incentive to be corrected."
25620,Minimal isnt zero.
25621,👍
25622,The second part
25623,[removed]
25624,What a piece of shit
25625,"You are correct, the vaccines I mentioned have decades of data to back them up."
25626,"That being said, the COVID vaccine has far more data than its short life would suggest."
25627,And the data we have is very clear that the vaccines are extremely safe and extremely effective (despite this latest news about the delta variant).
25628,"Again, you are correct, and I agree with you, but the EUA that these vaccines are being used under does not mean they were rushed or are unsafe."
25629,"The anti-COVID vaccine crowd isn’t quibbling with the FDA’s process, they’re being fed BS and whipped into a frenzy for a political purpose."
25630,Not to mention children often mimic their parents political beliefs.
25631,You know kids who do decide to wear masks are going to get bullied if they're the only ones.
25632,"The sad thing is, he isn’t dumb."
25633,He’s acting dumb now but he’s an accomplished man.
25634,I’m kind of curious how midterms will shape up with so many on the right dying or having to be hospitalized maybe realizing they were lied to.
25635,I can’t imagine there will be much enthusiasm from them.
25636,This asshole keeps blaming everything on the Federal Government while at the same time says he wants them out of Texas and out of Texas affairs.
25637,Then he pulls shit like this while blaming COVID on immigrants.
25638,I hope he catches the new variant and chokes on it!
25639,"Ya no shit, thats why the *people electing them* need to make health and wellbeing a focal point."
25640,Texas is an example against this.
25641,Southern states have always handled this shit worse since it started hitting them.
25642,This is par for the course.
25643,"Stay Safe, good Redditor."
25644,"I mean, legally (if you're in the states) most states make it very hard for them to just kick you out."
25645,Look up tenant rights for your state because that is bullshit.
25646,I'm sorry you're having to deal with covid and a shit roommate situation.
25647,"No one deserves that, especially at the same time."
25648,Good luck and do some searching on that before you let someone kick you out of somewhere you're legally allowed to be.
25649,If they didn't want to respect smart decision making (they should've masked up as well in common areas etc) then that's on them.
25650,"My gf and I recently had to take care of her mom when she had covid, we'd go to the house with all the windows open, kn95 masks, cook a few meals, clean up, drop off any medicine and water etc and then get out of there."
25651,"Neither one of us got sick during that time because we all followed proper procedure to mitigate risk (and I'm vaccinated with Pfizer so I handled gathering laundry and any ""closer"" contact, my gf just got her first shot because things are incredibly slow here in Mexico)."
25652,"It's not on you, it's on them for not doing their part."
25653,[removed]
25654,I’d say that yes at some point it is inevitable.
25655,If you are vaccinated I wouldn’t think you should need to be terrified of being infected.
25656,"Concerned yes, but not terrified."
25657,"Just lower your risk level to what you are comfortable with, adjusting your lifestyle to align with it."
25658,"For me I am likely going back to a set social bubble, grocery delivery service, and hoping that I can keep doing WFH, despite my company finally officially rolling out our new policy and office start date yesterday."
25659,"If you have an unmanageable level of anxiety from this, perhaps you should virtually speak to someone (professional) about it if you are able."
25660,I have a family member who has struggled with major hypochondria issues throughout the pandemic and finally admitted to themself that they are mentally ill and need help.
25661,Their anxiety was straining their family life and needed attention.
25662,No shame in it!

25673,You'll change your math when a vaccine defeating variant arises because we let Delta spread rampant among the vaccinated population.
25674,Oh damnit Indiana what the fuck.
25675,"I agree with you 100%

This is for the greater good."
25676,These anti male laws are such a strange and sad flex.
25677,Didn’t Texas already have school in person most of last year?
25678,Also I doubt masks make that much of a difference if you’re locked in a room with 30 people all day.
25679,"That’ll all be gloriously floating around, it doesn’t matter that the mask is reducing the initial spread distance."
25680,Edit: I support wearing masks and getting vaccinated.
25681,[removed]
25682,Different hospitals use different code systems sometimes (although some are more universal such as Code Blue).
25683,"I would guess a code black is the code they use for a mass casualty event, or a disaster event that will require diversion of resources away from non-emergent needs."
25684,"Yes, vaccinated people can probably still transmit the virus in some cases, but the vast majority of transmission, cases, and hospitalizations occur among unvaccinated people."
25685,"I'm not an anti-masker by any means, but if half the country doesn't want to take a free and easy precaution to protect themselves and their communities, why are we blaming vaccinated people who didn't/don't wear masks because the CDC said they could essentially return to life as normal?"
25686,If anyone is to blame for community transmission and full hospitals it's still unvaccinated people.
25687,empathy is different IMO.
25688,think of Autism for example.
25689,someone doesn’t need empathy to not be racist.
25690,they just need the ability to think abstractly.
25691,that comes from regular exposure to different cultures and scenarios where you can put yourself in someone’s shoes.
25692,empathy is the reaction afterwards.
25693,do i feel the same thing someone else feels?
25694,am i able to sense someone else’s emotional state and feel the same thing?
25695,that can happen even without thinking abstractly.
25696,for most people the two are intertwined.
25697,abstract thoughts lead to higher levels of empathy and vice-versa.
25698,I haven't seen any numbers going down in the US.
25699,until they leave and no one is left around to donate $ to his dumb ass
25700,Sounds like you should get the CDC on the horn and point this out to them so that they can just authorize third doses.
25701,Since they’re consistently behind the eight ball on this shit.
25702,We actually fell to like 10th fattest state
25703,The people against vaccines don’t even know what a fucking ribosome is.
25704,America is not a monolith.
25705,Plenty of Americans (probably over 50%) agree with what you are saying.
25706,"There are just pockets of weird, idiotic holdouts around the country."
25707,Regardless of vaccination wouldn’t this happen without vaccines as well?
25708,Reinfections with natural immunity would result in the same thing.
25709,This is what I'm afraid we're going to have to do.
25710,"My wife is at home full time thankfully, but I'm not sure she can handle another year of being teacher-mom to 6 kids."
25711,Lmfao I work fast food in a pro-trump anti-mask city.
25712,This would be like every few days for me Im not doing that I dont even have a car or how ever much that would cost
25713,"Uber actually has a program in place [where rides are donated for people going to get vaccinated](https://www.uber.com/us/en/coronavirus), if you need a free Uber!"
25714,"You’re missing the point- even if Delta spread more to areas like the Northeast, the impact wouldn’t be nearly as bad as the south since vax rates are so high."
25715,"Most cases would be minor, if not completely asymptomatic- which means masking indoors is not necessary, although I wouldn’t blame someone for doing it of course."
25716,This is insanity.
25717,"And eight million (or 40%) already have their first jab, so Australia is literally halfway there on first jabs."
25718,"Since most will be Pfizer here on out, that is three weeks until the second shot."
25719,It’s easily doable by even November/December.
25720,"Last week, Australia had the most vaccines given ever."
25721,"This week is even better, as every day this week since Tuesday is the most vaccines ever given in a day."
25722,Australia done messed up but the D&amp;G coming from Australians on this sub right now is odd given how many vaccines are coming into their country.
25723,And the rural voters ate it up.
25724,Instead of trying to replace those jobs in coal cities he decided to poison our rivers and air more
25725,I really wish the media and CDC would just be honest.
25726,"To people who aren't scared it's making them angry, to people who are, well they already are, making them more scared isn't helping anything."
25727,Then you have the unvaccinated and resistant population who look at the sensationlism and just double down and reenforce their distrust even more.
25728,How many new unvaccinated people is this messaging actually reaching?
25729,I'm not going to say it's causing more harm than good because I have a limited perspective on the world but through this lens that's what I see.
25730,That one should be on time.
25731,ICU physician here.
25732,We’re seeing lots of late stage cancers that could have been caught earlier and acute exacerbations of chronic diseases at a higher rate than normal.
25733,Both a consequence of delayed treatment.
25734,The Delta variant is inadvertently scaring people into getting vaccinated.
25735,Blyat.....
25736,Damn.
25737,This is such an eloquent description of a huge chunk of the population.
25738,I wish it were an exaggeration...
25739,I don't know if we have a good answer on that.
25740,"I've seen people post on here before that the FDA has said boosters won't have to go through a full approval process, but I've never seen any links that go into the mechanics of an accelerated approval regime."
25741,"It's also possible that different countries may or may not also pursue some kind of ""booster fast-track""."
25742,"My personal POV is that we need to figure out a pretty clear-cut way to to dramatically slash the approval cycle time for tweaks to the vaccine, because if it takes a year to approve an EUA for updates, we're going to be perpetually locked into a losing race against new variants."
25743,"My understanding is that actually updating the ""code"" for mRNA vaccines is trivially easy, and that it doesn't take much to change over production lines to make variant-boosters."
25744,The main bottleneck is the approval process.
25745,The secondary bottleneck (at least for 2021/2022) is then production of those boosters in sufficient quantities to blanket the population again.

25772,"But birth control isn’t 100% effective, they had already given up a kid for adoption and had a lot of pain from that, and abortion was too tough a choice for them at the time."
25773,"As an American, I’m so embarrassed."
25774,People in other countries are desperate for vaccines and we have a huge supply but can’t convince our own asshats to get vaccinated.
25775,"Oh yeah, that's the best source ever."
25776,The company that makes the product says it works.
25777,Ask the Washington Nationals how well it works.
25778,They have an outbreak of 11 infections.
25779,That still doesn’t solve the problem of being able to homeschool the kids because the parents have to sleep when they are at home.
25780,It limits Democrat-led government by encouraging the pandemic to spread among their voters.
25781,"Yes, do what you want and I'll do what I want, which is telling you that the track of thoughts that lead you to the conclusion that you shouldn't get vaccinated is cretinous."
25782,"You keep suggesting that we're trying to feel smarter and more righteous than unvaccinated people when in truth, the only thing we care about is getting rid of this virus."
25783,It's pure pragmatism.
25784,Of course we're going to resent those who sabotage our only chance to recover rapidly from the pandemic.
25785,Damn I miss that series
25786,A full world lockdown?
25787,Yet another reason to avoid Texas
25788,"We are not only giving them away, in some places they PAY YOU to take it."
25789,The Republican Party is dead.
25790,It’s literally the party of death and ignorance now.
25791,"And then as soon as you're not locked down, it spreads again."
25792,"Unless you plan on going door to door and forcing needles into people's arms during said lockdown, it only delays the inevitable."
25793,&gt;This means that the new virus could spread though the vaccinated population just as easily as the unvaccinated population.
25794,"It absolutely doesn't mean that; vaccines still have an effect on infection, but it is likely lower with Delta."
25795,"They are saying that people who get breakthrough infections can transmit the virus just like unvaccinated people, not that vaccinated people are spreading the virus just as much as unvaccinated people."
25796,"Vaccines reduce your chances of catching it, reduces your chances of it being symptomatic if you do catch it and most importantly *greatly* reduces the chances of hospitalization or death if you do feel symptoms."
25797,Good luck with that one buddy.
25798,This is exactly it.

25810,Not the half assed one we had last year.
25811,Boogeyman word apparently that nobody wants to mention any more.
25812,The most US data I can find recently is Arkansas Ped hospital saying they are having record admissions this month including kids under 12 and kids without any underlying health conditions.
25813,Very concerning.
25814,"Well you better hope it is enough, otherwise I don't know how we can stop it."
25815,Texas just banned local mask mandates and they are not the only state that will never have one again.
25816,"Universal Orlando is not requiring masks for customers and neither is Walmart, just employees."

25820,"He won’t die on this hill, he’s leaving our kids up there to die in his place."
25821,Your article isn’t based on actual human behavior.
25822,"For instance, if this Delta strain is indeed easier to transmit than Chicken Pox, during the last mask mandate, it wasn’t uncommon for individuals to enter restaurants, bars, clubs, move theaters, and other social gathering places then proceed to remove their masks."
25823,That happened everywhere and in every state.
25824,"If that’s the case, mask mandates themselves will have little success in stopping the spread of Delta."
25825,Only the reintroduction of COVID lockdowns.
25826,That’s not going to happen and that’s not something I will ever support.
25827,"I will maintain that with the data I have seen, the best course of action is to get vaccinated and move on."
25828,COVID is here for the long term.
25829,I’m vaccinated and every piece of data shows the chances of me ending up in the hospital or dead is greatly reduced.
25830,"Yes, the virus will mutate."
25831,"The only way to prevent that at this point is mandated, forced vaccinations."
25832,It’s spreading fast enough it’ll burn out in a couple of months
25833,It's scheduled for october in France.
25834,Why bother with thoughts and prayers.
25835,"Plus, I would make my kid wear a seatbelt and ride in a safe vehicle."
25836,Not mandating masks at school is like speeding to class with no seatbelt on because freedom.
25837,concrete vs abstract thinking.
25838,Some simply do not contain the ability to think in abstracts terms.
25839,"“How would you feel if you were black and your house appraised for half of what it does now because of that?”

Concrete response:
“I’m not black and I just refinanced."
25840,"so how does that make sense?”

Abstract:
“i never thought of it that way."
25841,In my head let me replace my skin color and pretend like i got the news my home lost half its value because of that.
25842,Wow i would feel shitty.
25843,"Man that lady that happened to must feel really shitty.”

There are numerous examples in southern and rural areas of people who are completely unable to think in abstract terms."
25844,This has to do with exposure.
25845,"As soon as you are exposed personally to the effects of racism, sexism, violence, discrimination, etc… things change."
25846,You don’t have to be exposed to all of those things to think abstractly either.
25847,"But the more often you are confronted with those things, the easier it becomes to think more abstractly."
25848,The earlier the better to prevent a cycle of misinformation and dangerous rhetoric that literally gets people killed.
25849,"Texas is a proverbial petri dish, an environment where the hosts of unvaccinated and vaccinated are split down the middle."
25850,"This, combined with absolutely no mitigation policies so that as much vaccinated people get the virus as possible, allowing the possibility of a vaccine resistant variant to emerge."
25851,This is exactly how it happens.
25852,"&gt;""We found that a fast rate of vaccination decreases the probability of emergence of a resistant strain,"" the team wrote."
25853,"&gt;""Our results suggest that policymakers and individuals should consider maintaining non-pharmaceutical interventions and transmission-reducing behaviors **throughout the entire vaccination period**."""
25854,"So the justification for continued masking relies on a belief that we're going to substantially increase the number of people vaccinated, and do it quickly."
25855,I think that's wishful thinking not grounded in reality.
25856,Would you stay inside in Vermont when there's bad air quality in California?
25857,It's been 18 months and people still don't understand 7 day averages?
25858,"If I worked retail, I would honestly be making an effort to stay inside when not working if I can, since testing positive could mean losing 10-14 days of pay, and there’s currently no employment protections for blue collar workers who get infected."
25859,This is information that has what??

25861,?
25862,I'm thinking the Delta surge will be 4-6 weeks based on the UK.
25863,We're pretty similar.
25864,So that's my guess.
25865,There will be little restriction for vaccinated people.
25866,The free market will force the unvaccinated hands.
25867,It'll be an interesting August.
25868,[removed]
25869,Requiring vaccination makes it safe.
25870,The masks are security theater otherwise if people are eating and drinking.

25875,It's in the Substantial zone - https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#county-view
25876,I bet there weren't too many 60+ people there though.
25877,"Also people who are at higher risk would be less likely to want to spend hours in packed bars, even if vaccinated."
25878,"I'm not claiming that the hospitalization rate for vaccinated people is that high... but crowds at Provincetown bars aren't really a representative sample of the public, that's all I'm saying."

25880,I can't speak to Canadian recommendations.
25881,I was giving a direct answer to the question of whether it's approved in the US.
25882,What happens in some practices and what early research shows is effective are separate topics.
25883,"I think our guidelines will probably change soon, but that's just speculation"
25884,"857,000 new shots, 563,000 first shots."
25885,Highest total in one day since July 1st.
25886,"Damn, he really wants his constituents to die."
25887,Oh sure you can if you’re a hypocrite
25888,"As far as I know from the sources I remember seeing, when talking about hospitalizations they include the partly vaccinated adults in the vaccinated group, even though they don't have full immunity yet."
25889,The article you linked corrects false previous info and says 60% are unvaccinated.
25890,"As the comment below says, 88% of the adult population has received at least one vaccine."
25891,"Also, children, as we know, are thankfully rarely hospitalized."
25892,People who end up being hospitalized after both vaccines are mostly the previously most vulnerable groups - older and with other underlying conditions.
25893,So it's not really 70/30 when you take everything into account.
25894,"Another factor is that although the virus can infect those vaccinated, it spreads faster among unvaccinated, so that happens first."
25895,That's what's still happening in the US in most parts.
25896,"In the UK the initial situation was the same, but then it changed."
25897,"Unfortunately it might change here too, especially in higher vaccinated areas."
25898,"I understand your concern, when I first read the stats I was very confused."
25899,But then I read some articles and watched videos that analyzed the situation and realized how much nuance there is in all this and how little I understand.
25900,The main stat everyone should be looking at is the difference between hospitalizations and deaths in the UK during this wave and the previous one.
25901,"Well, you kind of have to consider the possible actions."
25902,"I am looking to do the following:
 - roll back face to face interaction with friends  
 - already re-implemented masks even when outdoors  
 - cancel their summer camps  
 - think seriously about what / how to do online schooling as our district has all but fully killed the virtual option   

There are probably others, but we are going to be forced to make tough decisions."

25908,"I agree new mandates are dumb, but I also don’t know if it’s a good idea for the governor of a state to have this much power over the cities."
25909,Sleep is for the weak.
25910,Ground Zero lets go!!
25911,!
25912,&gt; Masks are required to slow transmission to the point where the virus can no longer mutate into variants.
25913,The only scenario where masking actually prevents mutations is if it restricts the R-number to less than 1.0.
25914,"In any other scenario, it only slows down their emergence."
25915,"And looking at the recent case counts in places like [Thailand](https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/country/thailand/) and [Malaysia](https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/country/malaysia/) where masking is a cultural norm, and not nearly so politicized, it doesn't look like masking is reducing the R-number very much, if at all."
25916,"Over 90% of people in the UK have Covid antibodies, mostly through vaccination."
25917,"As a weird turn of fate the shit hole that is my state, Mississippi, is one of the most vaccinated states if I remember right."
25918,"With general vaccinations anyways, i'm not sure how it is with Covid."

25920,My grandpa died and the funeral will probably be in a week somewhere in Salt Lake City.
25921,"I'm vaccinated, and have been since May, but I can't say I'm excited to be around a bunch of people what with the Delta variant going around."
25922,"If I go, it's pretty likely that I'll be exposed, right?"
25923,"I know I'll be protected, but I'm still not happy about the situation."
25924,A lot of people don't give a shit about COVID in Utah...I haven't been there since before the pandemic.
25925,Sweet home Alabama
25926,Vaccine mandates are cruel.
25927,"I think it has also a lot to do with the fact that unlike previous pandemics-epidemics people know how many people test +ve in a given area and adjust behavior, leading to this yo-yo."
25928,If people had no clue of how much it's spreading I think the virus would burn itself out infecting many more people.
25929,"Meanwhile,  in California,  our school district sent out a ""share your opinion"" type poll, and I didn't see a single person replying who was not asking for kids to be masked, receive outdoor instruction, etc."

26027,I think people here are far more excited about this fantasy of an eternal pandemic and useless vaccines than they are genuinely interested in what's the best societal compromise going forward for dealing with something that's never going away (but is very manageable with vaccines).
26028,The vaccine dialogue baffles me as well - people here hate anti-vaxxers but love to emphasise what feels like every case of a breakthrough infection or the very very occasional death of a vaccinated person.
26029,It seems like it's mostly about feeding their superiority complexes than anything else.
26030,And then we're going to see even more cases and then those states will be like why didn't anyone warn us?!?!
26031,Sigh...

26081,The Republicans have literally picked a hill to die on.
26082,You’ll never get above 70% vaccination unless you force people to get it.
26083,I think your analysis is flawed in a couple of ways.
26084,"First, Gottlieb has said that during the winter wave, he thinks we were only capturing ~1/2 of the cases."
26085,"Second, and most importantly, deaths (hopefully) won’t scale that way, as most of the unvaccinated are people who are in lower risk groups."
26086,The death rates for those groups is still high—they should get vaccinated if they are eligible—but it is much smaller.
26087,"Thus, the ratio of deaths/cases should be lower than it was."
26088,"You can see this very clearly in the UK data, so I’m not pulling things out of nowhere."
26089,"Yep, and bullies will still bully those kids and do things like cough or spit on them as part of that bullying."
26090,"Hey, some of us are in countries that have shit rollout ."
26091,"I was able to go home and get vaccinated, but my husband was stuck working and couldn't come with."
26092,"And in our city in Japan, the vouchers/coupon to make him eligible to get vaccinated for his age group hasn't arrived (my FIL's age group just came last week)."
26093,This is actually an anti-mask mandate.
26094,Preventing school districts from mandating masks for students.
26095,Diatribe?
26096,Triggered?
26097,"Bruh, get a dictionary."
26098,"No shit its fucking Alabama.....

Ranked 46th in Education
Ranked 45th in Healthcare
7th highest poverty rate
7th highest unemployment rate

That combination is not conducive with good decision making."
26099,All of that information is now outdated.
26100,The most recent CDC leaked documents are giving delta an R factor of 10 or higher.
26101,As contagious as chickenpox.
26102,And the protection against getting infected at all is starting to appear to be way lower than 80-90%.
26103,And even if you did some sort of super lockdown and vaccination the entire world would have to do it together.
26104,That will never happen.
26105,Covid is here forever.
26106,Get vaccinated and move on.
26107,Ok ok
26108,"Yes, exactly."
26109,Government has been limited.
26110,"I'm getting downvoted because you folks disagree with the policy, not because this isn't limited government."
26111,Common sense is the rarest thing in Texas.
26112,That's really what it all boils down to.
26113,Sitting back and watching the narrative implode
26114,"So when they measure the # of Total Covid Hospitalizations (923 Yesterday), those people are all in for COVID."
26115,"But when they report that 410 total breakthrough cases hospitalized, some of those aren't in there for COVID?"
26116,"Even that seems ridiculous, because in a county of 5M vaccinated, roughly 1/2 hospitalizations for ALL OTHER CAUSES should be vaccinated."
26117,"Thus, that number should be in the thousands DAILY."
26118,Says the guy who got the vaccine and generally stays isolated from the public.
26119,[removed]
26120,I completely get it.
26121,The latest CDC guidance affects anti-vaxxers the least is what pisses a lot of people off.
26122,"They tend to live in areas with no chance of mask mandates anyway, this is only going to affect fully vaccinated people living in responsible states."
26123,symptoms could mean having a small cough
26124,[removed]
26125,I've honestly been shocked at the response in NJ with masks from day one.
26126,"For the most part, we have high compliance."
26127,Absurdly high.
26128,Same with vaccines in those 65 and older and I KNOW for a fact a good number of them are Fox News loving Republicans.
26129,"I just can't grasp how even some people in my family can make perfect sense talking about COVID, masking, make ""I just told my friend she better get her shots or we're not seeing each other anymore"" type statements... and then go right back into their echo chamber on everything else."
26130,"I am, however, thankful that they've chosen to let go on this one thing and keep it safe for themselves and their families."
26131,A Redditor on r/FloridaCoronavirus was saying [code black was going to happen](https://old.reddit.com/r/FloridaCoronavirus/comments/osqtbn/advent_health_just_went_code_black_meaning_they/) 2 days ago.
26132,They cited various employees were in meetings talking about it.

26134,Jacobson vs Massachusetts would like to have a word...

26136,"Is there some rush to the bottom of the list of things ""ethically and scientifically void"" I'm unaware of?"
26137,I feel like everyday some state does something dumb with regards to Covid.
26138,"Then Texas is like ""hold my beer"""
26139,Thank you for this!
26140,They bring up another excellent point that I had forgotten about.
26141,"In regard to the viral load, the slides are referencing India, which was under the US in terms of vaccination and the vaccines used."
26142,It’s comparing apples to oranges.
26143,Two completely different scenarios between the two countries.
26144,Why so early?
26145,What is the school year duration in Arizona?
26146,It looks like they knew otherwise and hid it.
26147,"We're finding this stuff out from a leaked internal memo, apparently?"
26148,For fucks sake if that's true ....
26149,It will never end.
26150,There are already new mutations on the way.
26151,Soon it will evade the current vaccines almost completly.
26152,Oh for sure.
26153,[removed]
26154,"I look at the data, the research, and what makes sense."
26155,"I respect Dr. Fauci, but I don’t worship him either."
26156,"And for all of the reasons I’ve already explained, I disagree with these suggestions and won’t wear a mask in places where it isn’t required and it’s safe not to."
26157,Can he do that if it’s a private business?
26158,Isn’t it like “we reserve the right to refuse service” and “no shirt no shoes no service”?
26159,I mean that province basically said they don't care about covid anymore so I think being concerned is valid.
26160,"I can guarantee in a few months fewer than expected children will die, but in a few years it will be evident they have long Covid symptoms for life."
26161,"Of course this will not matter to the republicans who will use their ""survival rate"" as evidence they were right."
26162,I haven't been in to our office since March 2020.
26163,They opened it for the first time about 3 months ago.
26164,We are supposed to voluntarily upload our vaccine card.
26165,I did but I have no need to go back.
26166,So far only about 5% of our office has even been back in the office for a day.
26167,We are supposed to start our new hybrid work setup in September where we are in the office 2-3 days a week.
26168,Apple and Google have delayed their back to the office until October.
26169,I'm fairly sure that our company will follow them and do the same.
26170,The conspiracy rabbit hole will never fucking end.
26171,“Evidence” is for liberals I guess.
26172,The people who are unvaccinated are the same people who were ignoring safeguards all across the country anyway so there’s not much of a difference there.
26173,"Many of them won't care, because the CDC guidance affects them the least."
26174,The majority of them live in areas with no chance of mask mandates.
26175,They are gonna have to learn from a severe infection with delta.
26176,If they know whats good for them they would get vaccinated before it hits them.
26177,There’s a third of this country willing to die for him and get him back in office.
26178,"If he’s not in prison, he will be running in 2024."
26179,"Republicans have seen they can get away with anything, so they’ll be going full steam ahead."
26180,I’d be relieved to be proved wrong.
26181,But the one side benefit is that those blue town residents are probably smart enough to still mask up even though they are vaccinated.
26182,"I got my two shots months ago, but my wife and I still mask up when we step out, even if it is wearing a cloth mask or one with a filter."
26183,Anything is better than nothing.
26184,Schools will be open for a week before parents start pulling their kids because of covid infections in the class.
26185,Same.
26186,My kid will be two in October.
26187,"Hopefully, shortly after the vaccine will be available for the 2-5 age group so she can get it."
26188,You can guarantee that those people who are parroting that migrants line everywhere aren't vaccinated themselves.
26189,Guarantee.
26190,My bad i misread your comment
26191,"The same people who say the Fed can't tell the states what they can mandate, now say the states can control local cities and towns."
26192,Inconsistency much?
26193,We need this to be overruled at a federal level requiring masks in schools.
26194,Florida and Texas are in some kind of deathmatch where we all lose.
26195,That's not what the article is saying.
26196,Good.
26197,Let Darwinism do its thing.
26198,I had covid.
26199,The only  long term symptom I have noticed is that my poo now smells like pickled onions.
26200,"Too be honest, I kind of like it..."
26201,"I completely lost my sense of taste and smell, so I think when I recovered some of the nerves or brain connections grew back in a slightly different arrangement."
26202,My wife now finds some smells disgusting that she previous enjoyed.
26203,Issue for the fancy perfumes she bought.
26204,Gf and her family all tested positive within a week of seeing one another.
26205,"She, her mum and bro are all exhibiting symptoms, the latter two are bedbound."
26206,Luckily my gf has gad her first vaccination which will help her fight it off.
26207,"Honestly I am barely holding it together, I want nothing more than to go and get her and look after her 24/7."
26208,But I can’t.
26209,American stupidity is gonna end civilization as we know it.
26210,Ive had the pretty uncommon experience of being in a rollover car accident.
26211,Covid in the US feels like when you've been hit and your car is starting to roll.
26212,"Its too late to do anything about being hit and while your car is technically not totaled yet, in the very near future it will be completely fucked and unusable."
26213,The US is rolling the car on purpose and thinking its going to be drive-able if they can get it to come to rest rightside up.
26214,Its not.
26215,There is no going back to your undamaged car.
26216,"As another said, if you didn’t get it as a kid I’d seriously consider getting it."
26217,"I was born in 92, didn’t get it as a kid, but did get it sometime around 18 if I remember correctly."
26218,"Maybe before going to college, or maybe it was before high school, but either way I was recommended to get it at a certain age since I hadn’t gotten a natural infection as a kid."
26219,"I know deleting Facebook is the new version of ""Kill Your Television"" but life really is much better after getting rid of it."
26220,I haven't had an account for years now and I know I haven't missed a damn thing.
26221,I'm still in touch with the people who matter.
26222,And no longer hear the incessant bad takes of people who don't matter.
26223,Explain numbers in UK and India crashing from delta?
26224,"So, you don't have an answer."
26225,"Because I'm trying to engage in conversation and you deflected and got defensive, and hoped I'd not realize that ""my end goal is the same as everybody else's"" is not an answer."
26226,It ignores that people have very different ideas of what an acceptable end goal looks like.
26227,"So, I'll ask again, what's your end goal?"
26228,Yes so you meant to say they didn't have symptoms.
26229,"Doctors observing their ICUs are not good sources of information, because they only see the worst cases."
26230,"You need more widespread data to draw any conclusions, [like this](https://abcnews.go.com/US/vast-majority-icu-patients-covid-19-unvaccinated-abc/story?id=79128401), which concludes that the ""vast majority of ICU patients with covid are unvaccinated."""
26231,"After a year and a half of bucking whatever medical experts say, it's almost as if the Texas Governor wants Texans to die."
26232,Well well well if it the consequences of my own actions.
26233,now watch me vote for the guy who wants to cut medicaid!!!
26234,!
26235,Same here.
26236,I'm so tired of how things are going here.
26237,"It's one thing when it's just politics, but it's another when it's edicts like this which are intentionally designed to place lives at risk."
26238,Some of those own employees hate it also.
26239,Is he going to work in the hospital when shit hits the fan?
26240,So you are ok with getting it and then spreading it and having some old or immune compromised person getting it and dying?
26241,Cool
26242,Florida: “Hold my margarita”
26243,Tread on me harder daddy
26244,"Meanwhile, Texas governor doubles down on ""fuck the kids"""
26245,Arkansas is considering repealing it’s law banning local and school mask mandates.
26246,Things are getting bad.
26247,Pediatric ICU is filling up and nursing shortages.
26248,Another article I read today said in Arkansas they are seeing kids under 12 and kids without any underlying health conditions in the ICU for Covid.
26249,This is pure evil and just wrong.
26250,"He should be a shamed, especially since many  children going to school this fall will be maskless and unvaxxed."
26251,Really really heartbreaking.
26252,I do not wish COVID on anyone and hope the children and unvaxxed have a change of mind to do what is right and get vaxxed and stay masked.
26253,My Governor banned mask mandates and vaccine mandates but thinks cracking down on migrants will help
26254,"It’ll be alright, I hope, my kids know to not take off their masks, Wash hands, not to go grabbing other people’s things."
26255,They’ve always been that way and now are even more aware.
26256,"Plus, they both wear their masks just fine when we go anywhere, no complaining."
26257,It’s just that a lot of kids and parents are dirty and don’t care.
26258,I am curious at how this will affect voting map in the elections in the next few years.
26259,"A lot of republican voters are dying, and some states already had marginal differences in outcomes."
26260,Even with GOP changing it’s tune on vaccines this month - it’s kinda too late and clearly isn’t enough to convince their base.
26261,Expecting a lot of desperate gerrymandering in the coming years.
26262,I have a concert end of next month and I'm fully vaxxed and have the same concerns as you.
26263,I was finally feeling good again a couple months ago and then I started seeing the Delta wave coming and knew things were gonna get shitty again for a bit.
26264,As much as I want to go and be like it'll be fine!
26265,I know the amount of anxiety I'll feel if cases are still high will ruin the experience.
26266,Don't feel bad if your anxiety keeps you from going.
26267,Most people understand and I appreciate you don't want to spread to little ones!
26268,"It’s going to end with hybrid herd immunity- a mix of vaccinations and natural immunity, and I’m tired of people who are pushing for restrictions pretending like they’re doing anything other than making it take longer to get there."
26269,Then what is?
26270,I'll give you guys a hint.
26271,Nothing.
26272,A lot of people actually have the virus dormant in their bodies.
26273,"In some individuals, covid must be doing something that causes it to trigger."
26274,That seems racist considering that POC have some of the lowest rates of vaccination.
26275,https://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/covid-vaccine-tracker-global-distribution/us-vaccine-demographics.html
26276,SARS-CoV-2 is not a retrovirus and the COVID-19 mRNA vaccines don’t make reverse transcriptase.
26277,They only contain one gene -- the gene for the SARS-CoV-2 viral spike protein.
26278,Dude obviously his username checks out.
26279,Just wanna point out how unrealistic it is to offer “get vaccinated” and “not being around people for the foreseeable future” as solutions.
26280,"First of all, people with compromised immune systems can’t get the vaccine, among many other people with other conditions."
26281,COVID obviously throttles them even worse.
26282,"Secondly, do you live here?"
26283,Lol where in Texas is it possible to survive without making contact with other people?
26284,Get a clue man.
26285,Abbott is playing politics and that’s all there is to it.
26286,Which is odd because the Texas constitution is written specifically to prevent the Governor from controlling smaller municipalities across the board.
26287,"Good, stay home if you're scared or get the vaccine."
26288,No masks in schools here and governor wants to.over turn for vs wade.
26289,Means he knows science and is looking for a higher office.
26290,/s
26291,But he is against big government.
26292,This is big government too!
26293,"Wow, this is awesome."
26294,I hope this is adopted in other cities.
26295,I wore my mask when we were working to flatten the curve to protect hospitals and buy time until we got a vaccine.
26296,"Sorry, but lifetime masking is something I'm not willing to do, nor are the vast majority of people."
26297,"You're completely free to mask up for life because you're afraid of the sniffles, I'll get my flu and covid shots and live with the small risk those diseases present to me just like I live with the risk of tons of other things in life."
26298,CDC prematurely declared that vaccinated individuals do not need to wear masks.
26299,Data has now come out that vaccinated individuals are spreading the Delta variant.
26300,Do you think the CDC did not botch anything when they made such a premature recommendation?
26301,The vaccination rates did not suddenly spike when the CDC made the change.
26302,"Peer pressure is real and palpable, so you could be right."
26303,It will come down to how many other big box stores mandate masks for customers.
26304,I think we will know in the coming days which ones will and which won't.
26305,I hope you are right :)
26306,So for all those anti-california people who moved to Texas - how's it going?
26307,Enjoying less taxes and a little more Covid?

26319,(Which is its own thing).

26331,Poc?
26332,Yes.
26333,But for now do everything you can.
26334,So not a only vaccines.
26335,"The reason vaccines were the answer is because immunity is the answer, and the more people who come down with covid, the more immunity there is."
26336,"The outbreaks are centered on areas with low vaccination rates, i.e."
26337,low immunity.
26338,"When the variant runs out of covid-naive bodies to infect, we'll reach the end of the tunnel."
26339,I hate him so much.
26340,My niece is 6 and diabetic.
26341,Every day I get more and more worried that she could get sick and this shit happens.
26342,Elimination is completely unrealistic and the societal cost would be worse than the virus.
26343,"Masks are effective at reducing the R0 of the virus, but the R0 of Delta is so insanely high that people need to be realistic about how much masks can help."
26344,"They may be able to reduce infection by a factor of 4 or so with perfect 100% use, but that is not attainable, and cutting the R0 of Delta to like 5 from 10 still leaves a virus that is 2 times more contagious than Alpha."
26345,Vaccines are by far and away more important than masks.
26346,hopefully low enough that they forget theyre antivax
26347,"We’re talking about a mask MANDATE, nothing stopping you from wearing a mask but nothing is going to force you to."
26348,This is pretty in line with Texas libertarian thinking.
26349,Yeah that’s what I was more or less saying.
26350,"Saban is a really smart guy and also pretty humble considering his success, he might not know how to do it but he would surround himself with people who do and then listen to them"
26351,I’m so sick of this willfully unvaccinated shitheads.
26352,I wish we could make life impossible for them since they’re hell bent on making this situation equally impossible.
26353,Let’s start by hiking their insurance rates through the roof.
26354,If a smoker is considered “at-risk” an unvaccinated person should be “at-nuclear-risk”
26355,We do also need to start thinking about overall risk.
26356,88% efficacy against og covid is much better than 88% efficacy against Delta because Delta is over twice as transmissible.
26357,Efficacy is not the end all be all.
26358,"BUT the overall risk of being infected is relatively low (especially weekly), so maybe no one wants to look like they're downplaying covid."
26359,Guess we can't handle the truth.
26360,BUT the worst of all is looking at absolute risk of either the vaccinated or unvaxxed group and passing it off as efficacy.
26361,We should absolutely call this out when used by pro- or anti-vaxxers.

26394,I don’t know what you expect me to say.
26395,This is just the necessity of my current circumstances.
26396,What was the point of being vaccinated then?
26397,"I've been vaccinated against tons of things (military), and I never got what I was vaccinated against."
26398,I was in areas where the diseases I was vaccinated against were all around... never got anything.
26399,"I mean if the Covid vaccine has risks of blood clots, cardiomyopathy, PE's, etc... and it isn't protecting you... why on Earth risk all that?"
26400,"Understandable, but from the limited data we do have on long covid among vaccinated individuals, the symptoms tend to be more typical post viral symptoms, like fatigue, persistent cough, joint pain soreness."

26488,"In the imgur link, I think thats total cumulative hospitalization throughout the week for vaccinated people."
26489,So 123 vaccinated went to the hospitalize in the last week of data.
26490,You are then going to the dashboard - which I think is showing how many are currently in the hospital over all.
26491,"So on 7/22 it was 645, on 7/29 it was 918."
26492,That doesn't mean 273 people went to the hospital during the week - just those currently in there.
26493,"Its possible throughout the week 1,000 people went to the hospital  and 727 left during the same period, so you end up with a net of 273."
26494,So comparing cumulative hospitalization in vaccinated to just current hospitalization of both.
26495,You would want to compare cumulative in vaccinated to cumulative in both over the same time period

26523,"A COVID-19 patient under home quarantine must have a separate room with windows as well as a separate toilet, a trash can with closed lid, and trash bags."

26531,"They need to eat nutritious food, drink a lot of water, exercise gently and do breathing exercises for at least 15 minutes daily."
26532,"They must call local medical workers if they have a fever of more than 38°C, cough, sore throat, diarrhoea, loss of taste or smell, chest pain or breathing difficulty (unable to take a breath and hold it for 10 seconds)."

26557,If you multiply that by 5 which is an estimated equivalent for the US you have about 250k cases.
26558,US deaths per day is about as much as the UK and is on the upswing so you could assume the US has more cases but they also have more unvaccinated so that will lead to more deaths.
26559,"Also, the deaths per day for the US started at a higher number before this wave because there was never UK style restrictions before the summer."

26699,Masks are not some magic totem that confer immunity on the wearer.
26700,The only exception is a properly fitted and worn N95.
26701,Sigh…
26702,Because there is more to life than living in constant fear of a virus that more than 99% of people survive.
26703,And those who perish often suffer from self inflicted co morbidities like obesity and high blood pressure.
26704,I’m done sacrificing to protect those people.
26705,You do you though.
26706,See how easy that was to make my point without resorting to an ad hominem attack?

26726,This is the most Texas thing I'll see all week
26727,It’s easy.
26728,Once you get the shot COVID is “just the flu”.
26729,You can still get sick but you’re not going to the hospital and you’re not going to die.
26730,"Wearing a mask doesn’t protect you, getting a shot protects you."
26731,A way to think about it is: someone is shooting at you and you can protect yourself with a tin tea cup (mask) or Kevlar body armor.
26732,With either one you can still take a bullet but one offers much more protection.
26733,Make people get the shots and this is over.
26734,For those of us that have shots it’s over.
26735,"And before you start with the “think of the children” nonsense look at the numbers, kids don’t get it as often or as bad."
26736,The real surge is unvaccinated adults.
26737,"Correction, it was breakthrough Alpha infections."
26738,"I'll just mosey on over to r-conservative to see what they have to say about-

26739,"Your state/local health department will know better than grumpy redditors, because delta has changed the math, and that math will vary from one place to another depending on community profile and transmission rates."
26740,You won't need to mask up forever.
26741,That would be weird.
26742,Depends.
26743,It's not super big but I would say anywhere from 10-30 people depending on the night.
26744,random sampling.
26745,"But yeah, without new testing and Vax mandates,  this will be hard to see."
26746,Luckily we're getting those mandates so we'll probably start to see more reports of asymptomatic vaxed testing positive soon.
26747,High risk customers have the option of using pickup or delivery services.
26748,High risk employees don’t have a choice about going to work.

26750,Why the hell would you ever live in Texas?

26754,What % of them were elderly or immuno-compromised?

26756,Republicans continue to show what big loser crybabies they are.
26757,"Not even equally, the pfizer vaccine seems to retain a 75% efficacy rate against infection in the U.S for the delta variant."
26758,The other 25% accounts for the breakthrough cases which the vast majority of them are mild.
26759,"Even before Delta, the virus had shown to be nearly impossible to fully contain with quarantines."
26760,"Australia did almost exactly as you describe, and Delta still made it through."
26761,"New Zealand has succeeded so far, but that bubble could pop any day."
26762,"And if you aren't at least somewhat likely to succeed with an all-or-nothing strategy, it's often best to find new strategies that aren't all-or-nothing instead of just rolling the dice."
26763,9/9 above.
26764,No way it’s 90-95% from infection anymore .

26768,One time I was visiting my parents in a rural northeastern town (one not known for having a high gay population).
26769,Drove my dad to bis doctor’s appt and the nurse assumed he was my husband.
26770,Nobody knows long term effects for these ones.
26771,Europe had hepatitis vax years back that they discontinued bc of the issues they were creating on a long term basis.
26772,But yeah mayne this one is exempt and will not kill us all.
26773,I strongly disagree with the last part tho.
26774,Yes some GOP people buy into the antivax stuff but why arent enlightened DC CA and NY all vaxxed?
26775,Vax hesitancy is NOT a GOP issue.
26776,"Hell, you heard black people freaking out bc of the syphillis experiments back in the day."
26777,DC black people arent rushing to get the vax and i can safely assume the number of republicans in their midst is close to 0.

26784,"It was never about ""States Rights""."
26785,"It was about slavery, and states rights was a way to keep slavery."
26786,And recently it was a way to criminalize abortion and revoke righrs from LGBT people.
26787,"Republican voters know this, they don't care about the principles of what level of government should make certain decisions."
26788,"They just want their beliefs enshrined in law, by any means necessary."
26789,"Which is why Republican politicians don't get punished for being hypocritical, because the voters don't care."
26790,"I know it can be fun to point it out, but sometimes the left can get distracted by the obvious disingenuousness of Republicans."

26795,"They hate Simone Biles now, too."
26796,The vast majority of people catching and spreading covid are unvaccinated.
26797,Especially with Delta which is much more transmissible we need as much people vaccinated as possible.
26798,Just 70% won’t cut it anymore to reach herd immunity.
26799,The P-Town data in this study is skewed because of the town’s incredibly high vaccination rate.
26800,Just look at the covid map on the NYT website and you’ll see that the biggest outbreaks are happening in unvaccinated areas.
26801,The Massachusetts outbreak is tiny by comparison.

26822,*
26823,I don't know much about this town specifically but according to this report 87% of the individuals that tested positive were male and it says that the events of the weekend were targeted toward adult males.
26824,Remember that this isn't a study it's an observation after the fact.
26825,"They saw some surprising data after this outbreak and went back to publish it, they didn't set forth to study this event specifically which is why there is no control group and why it may be difficult to extend this single event on a broader basis"

26828,These articles may feel like schadenfreude but I wonder if they convince anti-vaxxers.
26829,[removed]
26830,I don’t get how people think I didn’t understand that?
26831,My point was completely different and had nothing to do with Abbott’s hypocrisy (which I agree with).
26832,"My point was (to the original commenter I responded to): why would you hate on Abbott for having a big government policy, if you are pro-big government yourself?"
26833,"Yes he is a hypocrite, but isn’t it a good thing that he is doing something “big government”, something you supported all along?"
26834,It also takes time for the vaccine to work.
26835,It takes two weeks after the first dose to get any protection and another two weeks after the second dose.
26836,Altogether six weeks to achieve full vaccination.
26837,[removed]
26838,That might change as autumn approaches to convince more people to vaccinate.

26845,Glad to hear Austin is able to do this.
26846,it has happen last year but what if this is just a false positive due to a unreliable test result?
26847,"While it is bad with having any kind of positive result but overall this is a win showing that protocols, contract tracing, etc is working which is GOOD."
26848,6 cases out of over one thousand people is not that bad
26849,And why are you trying to add more you dummy
26850,"Lol, we don’t know the long term effects of a lot of things, that shouldn’t stop us from living our lives."
26851,Anything else is just a weak excuse.
26852,"The goal has always been to lock down till vaccines are available and hospitals aren’t overrun, anything else is just moving goalposts, if you want to stay inside the rest of your life, that’s your right, but I’d like the freedom to live my life how I want as a vaccinated person."
26853,"The ""99% of cases are unvaccinated"" talking point never passed the smell test from anecdotes alone."
26854,Never mind we saw what happened in Israel and Chile
26855,"So I understand that vaccinated people are far less likely to be hospitalized or killed by Delta, but are they now equally as susceptible to catching it?"
26856,"Like if a vaccinated person and an unvaccinated person both come into contact with an infected person, can the vaccinated person have a chance of not being infected?"

26869,"The vaccine does nothing to slow delta transmission, all it does is lessen the symptoms."

26977,I've been there multiple times and can attest to how crowded it gets during the peak tourist season.
26978,The reason for this statement is because duties and requirements of postal workers are dictated by a labor agreement.
26979,"Even executive orders, cannot (or at least is legally argued to be not the case) mandate postal workers to perform duties outside the parameters of their labor agreement."
26980,The APWU even says they do not have a moral opposition to vaccinations and encourage employees to get one.
26981,"The issue is that there are no contractual provisions to compensate employees for, 1) the healthcare costs of getting a rapid test, and 2) the time it takes outside of work to get tested."
26982,"There aren't contractual provisions for this, because why would there be?"
26983,There's never been a viral pandemic like this before.
26984,"Therefor, the argument is that the government cannot simply mandate postal workers to do something: it has to be negotiated, through the union, and ratified in a (temporary) agreement."
26985,"The exact same scenario occurred when in April 2020, 80 hours of administrative leave was issued to federal workers who had contracted covid, even though it unquestionably benefitted postal employees."
26986,"The Postal unions had to make a temporary addendum to allow the use of it, specify what qualifies someone to use it, how they notify their employer, what medical information their employer can know, etc."
26987,"As a matter of legal compensation, the APWU is saying until you ratify a temporary addendum that has a way to pay people for the time spent complying with this mandate, you cannot force anyone to do so."
26988,"Executive orders cannot mandate a violation of the USPS union labor agreement, and uncompensated, mandatory duties outside the scope of the requirements of postal employees is exactly such a violation."

27037,"PROVO, Utah — As Mindy Greene spent another day in the Covid intensive care unit, listening to the whirring machines that now breathed for her 42-year-old husband, Russ, she opened her phone and tapped out a message."
27038,"“We did not get the vaccine,” she wrote on Facebook."
27039,“I read all kinds of things about the vaccine and it scared me.
27040,"So I made the decision and prayed about it and got the impression that we would be ok.”

They were not."
27041,"Her husband, the father to their four children, was now hovering between life and death, tentacles of tubes spilling from his body."
27042,The patient in the room next to her husband’s had died hours earlier.
27043,"That day, July 13, Ms. Greene decided to add her voice to an unlikely group of people speaking out in the polarized national debate over vaccination: The remorseful."
27044,"“If I had the information I have today we would have gotten vaccinated,” Ms. Greene wrote."
27045,"Come what may, she hit “send.”

Amid a resurgence of coronavirus infections and deaths, some people who once rejected the vaccine or simply waited too long are now grappling with the consequences, often in raw, public ways."
27046,"A number are speaking from hospital beds, at funerals and in obituaries about their regrets, about the pain of enduring the virus and watching unvaccinated family members die gasping for breath."
27047,"Ms. Greene listened to an update on her husband’s health before entering the I.C.U., after spending the night at home with their four children."
27048,"Ms. Greene listened to an update on her husband’s health before entering the I.C.U., after spending the night at home with their four children.Kim Raff for The New York Times
“I have such incredible guilt,” Ms. Greene said one morning as she sat in the fourth-floor lobby outside the I.C.U."
27049,"at Utah Valley Hospital in Provo, which looks out to the mountains where her family once went hiking and four-wheeling."
27050,“I blame myself still.
27051,"Every day.”

The recent surge of infections and hospitalizations among unvaccinated people has brought the grim realities of Covid-19 crashing home for many who thought they had skirted the pandemic."
27052,"But now, with anger and fatigue piled up on all sides, the question is whether their stories can actually change any minds."
27053,"Some people hospitalized with the virus still vow not to get vaccinated, and surveys suggest that the majority of unvaccinated Americans are not budging."
27054,Doctors in Covid units say some patients still refuse to believe they are infected with anything beyond the flu.
27055,“We have people in the I.C.U.
27056,"with Covid who are denying they have Covid,” said Dr. Matthew Sperry, a pulmonary critical care physician who has been treating Mr. Greene."
27057,"“It doesn’t matter what we say.”

Covid hospitalizations in Utah have risen 35 percent over the past two weeks, and Dr. Sperry said intensive care units across the 24-hospital system where he works are 98 percent full."
27058,"Mr. Greene was comforted by his wife and Mr. Arnell, a friend who has spent nights in the hospital room when Ms. Greene is with her children at home.Kim Raff for The New York Times
Still, some hospitals swamped with patients in largely conservative, unvaccinated swaths of the country have begun to recruit Covid survivors as public health messengers of last resort."
27059,"The hope is that onetime skeptics might just persuade others who dismissed vaccination campaigns led by President Biden, Dr. Anthony Fauci and armies of local doctors and health workers."
27060,"Theirs are Scared Straight stories for a pandemic that has thrived on misinformation, fear and hardened partisan divisions over whether or not to get vaccinated."
27061,"“People are creating news from their hospital beds, from the wards,” said Rebecca Weintraub, an assistant professor of global health and social medicine at Harvard Medical School."
27062,“It’s the accessibility of the message: ‘I didn’t protect my own family.
27063,"Let me help you protect yours.’”

In Springfield, Mo., where coronavirus cases spiked this summer, Russell Taylor sat in a hospital gown, an oxygen cannula draped across his face, to offer a pro-vaccine testimonial in a hospital video."
27064,"“I don’t see how I could not get it now,” he said."
27065,A Texas man who underwent a double-lung transplant after contracting the virus made a plea on local television for others to get vaccinated.
27066,"And in a shaking voice, a hospital-clinic administrator in rural Utah described how she had been pummeled by double pneumonia and sepsis after choosing not to get vaccinated."
27067,"The woman, Stormy, said it had taken weeks to summon the nerve to speak out in a video posted by her local health department."
27068,She only did so using her first name because she worried that Covid deniers would say she was making it all up.
27069,"“I absolutely was fearful of the negative aspects that could come from it,” she said in an interview this week."
27070,"“I was part of a problem that I was trying to avoid.”

Some people who were quick to embrace the vaccine are now choosing to speak out about family members who did not."
27071,"It was a role Kimberle Jones never wanted, but one she embraced after her daughter, Erica Thompson, 37, a mother from St. Louis, died on July 4, nearly three months after she had what she thought was a bad asthma attack."
27072,"Kimberle Jones with a photo of her daughter, Erica Thompson, at her home in St. Ann, Mo.Michael B. Thomas for The New York Times
“I want to be a voice for her,” said Ms. Jones, who got vaccinated as soon as she was able to."
27073,"“I really think my daughter would want me to say, ‘Go get vaccinated.’”

It was advice Ms. Thompson — like some 39 percent of American adults — did not heed."
27074,Her mother said Ms. Thompson had been leery of how quickly the Moderna and Pfizer vaccines had rolled out — the culmination of decades of scientific research.
27075,"She also believed the government-run campaign was a plot against Black people like her, according to her mother."
27076,"Vaccination rates for Black and Hispanic Americans lag behind the white population, a gap that researchers attribute to distrust rooted in a history of medical discrimination and a lack of access and outreach."
27077,"After scraping by making $10 an hour at call-center jobs, Ms. Thompson had recently found a dream job doing medical coding."
27078,She went to the hospital coughing and struggling to breathe in mid-May and was on a ventilator within days.
27079,Ms. Jones said she sang “Beat It” as her daughter was sedated and promised to be there when she woke.
27080,"“Her last words to me were, ‘Mama I can’t breathe,’” Ms. Jones said."
27081,"Ms. Jones embraced her son, Antonio Jones, during a family viewing of her daughter’s body last week.Michael B. Thomas for The New York Times
In Utah, Ms. Greene said her husband had left the family’s vaccination decisions in her hands."
27082,"She initially planned to get the shot as soon as her next-door neighbor, a physician, got his."
27083,"But she had concerns about the vaccine, and found plenty of reasons to hesitate when she scrolled through social media or talked with anti-vaccine friends."
27084,"“You need to watch this,” one wrote to her."
27085,"Clicking on a few links took her down a rabbit hole of conspiracy theories touted by anti-vaccine attorneys and YouTubers, and videos in which anti-vaccine doctors and nurses decried the Covid-19 shots as “bioweapons.”

Covid crashed into the family’s world in late June when their two oldest sons brought the virus home from a church camp where nine boys got infected."
27086,The virus swept through the family.
27087,"Then came the day that Mr. Greene, a hunter who hiked across mountains, had to be rushed to the hospital when his oxygen levels cratered."
27088,"Now, they measure time in “Covid days.” Ms. Greene wakes up dry heaving many mornings."
27089,"Her four children — ages 8 to 18 — stay home while she visits the hospital, unable to tell their dad about dance class or smashing a hit deep into the outfield during a baseball game."
27090,"Ms. Greene and her children saying a prayer for their father’s condition to improve during a family meeting in their home in Saratoga Springs, Utah, on Friday.Kim Raff for The New York Times
There are uncertain months ahead as doctors try to repair Mr. Greene’s damaged lungs and wean him off a ventilator."
27091,"He was briefly transferred from the hospital to a long-term acute care center last week, a hopeful moment."
27092,"But doctors found a hole in his lungs, and he was rushed back into the intensive care unit."
27093,"“I will always regret that I listened to the misinformation being put out there,” Ms. Greene said."
27094,"“They’re creating fear.”

Even after Mr. Greene was put on a ventilator in early July, vaccine skeptics Ms. Greene knew texted her links to misinformation about fertility and hidden vaccine deaths."
27095,They sent her boxes of a horse medicine falsely touted as a Covid cure.

27098,Health experts and scientific studies have shown the vaccines are overwhelmingly safe and effective and are the best weapon against infectious new variants of the coronavirus.
27099,"Before Covid, the family’s life was anchored by their faith and community in the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints."
27100,"Now, church friends and neighbors bring dinners by the house and send updates to the congregation about Mr. Greene."
27101,"Ms. Greene begins her hospital visits with a spiritual reading and ends each night by gathering their children — Hunter, 18; Easton, 15; Betty, 13, and Rushton, 8 — to talk about their father and the prayers he needs."
27102,Her views shifted as the virus ravaged her husband’s body and doctors put him on a ventilator.
27103,"They shifted as she talked with doctors and nurses about the unvaccinated patients pouring into hospitals and sat outside the I.C.U., listening to life-flight helicopters arrive."
27104,Ms. Greene said she had made an appointment to get her children vaccinated.

27281,Getting all your shit delivered just offloads the risk onto others.
27282,You better be tipping a bunch if you are asking others to risk their lives for your groceries.
27283,In my experience people get their sense of smell back within a few days to a few months.
27284,I’m not sure what the actual stats are though
27285,I died with my first bout of covid.
27286,A witch cast a spell to bring me back to life and I got reinfected and died again 6 months later!
27287,Talk about bad luck!
27288,How are things darker now than last winter?
27289,Everything is open right now while everything was closed last winter
27290,"Vaccinated people will live their life and visit family knowing they are protected from serious illness

Unvaccinated will live their life and visiting family thinking they are protected because ""I did my own research"" or something"
27291,The crowds in Provincetown were young... so the hospitalization rate would be lower.
27292,so so so sad :( :/ i hate this and i hate the CDC screw them for ruining everything with their stupid messaging and screw the antivax community

27295,Olfactory bulb insensitivity is the first sign of Alhzeimers.

27298,I'm not as much of a supporter as these other people but he did some good things for the environment.
27299,"Also, not sure how much he was involved, but the legislature raised teachers pay to the second highest in the country, pre-covid iirc."
27300,I still hated him from the beginning but I look for silver linings and give credit where it's due.
27301,I will be sending a similar response to work tomorrow.
27302,One thing that I've learned in these 16 months is that past COVID performance is not indicative of future COVID performance.
27303,"""So far"" is doing a lot of work."
27304,"You mean shut-ins, not introverts."
27305,Introverts are people who take longer to recharge between social interactions.
27306,Shut-ins are the people who want lockdowns right now.
27307,"Its all political at this point , science is just used in limited context and its sad"
27308,But it's so much more dangerous for children.
27309,"We are going to see a spike in hospitalizations, long covid,.and yes, deaths of the under 18 set."
27310,**Everyone eligible needs to be vaccinated.
27311,We must stay vigilant with masks and social distancing**
27312,97% of hospitalizations are unvaccinated.
27313,The vaccines work fine
27314,"&gt; ""I have this feeling ... if I was vaccinated, I wouldn't be hospitalized,"" Matzen said."
27315,Yup.
27316,"If this sort of thing gets traction nationally then that's it, people will begin killing themselves over this news."
27317,This is disaster movie-tier reality that we are experiencing.
27318,I wonder if we will make it.
27319,"It will, eventually."
27320,Everyone just has to be patient and do what they can to protect themselves.
27321,"Every plague in history has eventually come to pass, and this will too, even though things seem really dark right now."
27322,Hang in there.
27323,"💖 We learn new things everyday, and we will learn new ways to combat this."

27341,Last year the canceled our daughters MRI for her cancer we had no idea what was going on for two months.
27342,They canceled chemo for little babies.
27343,It was all new then and we didn’t have a vaccine but Seriously because these assholes won’t get vaccinated this is happening again!
27344,!
27345,"&gt;So many people on here were parroting things like ""theres no evidence that vaxed people can spread it"" and it looks like the CDC drank the same kool-aid."
27346,Earlier variants showed greatly reduced levels of virus in the nose and throat.
27347,Delta does not.
27348,That's a major change.
27349,"Because wearing a mask is more about capturing what you might exhale, than what you might inhale."
27350,"Everyone needs to mask up, it's that simple."
27351,Getting the vaccination will help to moderate the effects of an infection.
27352,"Remember, 95-99% of those being admitted for COVID are unvaccinated."
27353,So far that's really only being seen among the elderly.
27354,"The good news is that from what I've read, a 3rd dose of the OG Pfizer vaccine seems to help a lot Delta-wise, so a specialized booster shot might not even need to be developed at this moment."
27355,What's the difference?
27356,This.
27357,what sauce?
27358,I was actually talking about literal skunk.
27359,"It has to be super faint, and it’s magic when it’s humid out."
27360,I know I’m not the only one and I refuse to be ashamed
27361,And to add nobody thats been to a club in the last few months is gonna care about this new guidance
27362,I'm going to assume businesses have no real interest in having their employees enforce these mandates again.
27363,"Hell most employees realized early on they might get shot if they do, so they stopped and everyone was just on the honor system"
27364,"Where's that ""this is worthless!"""
27365,meme?
27366,"Perhaps super early on someone *might* be entitled to a ""wait and see"" attitude."
27367,But we've crossed that line some time ago.
27368,"&gt; The data and studies cited in the document played a key role in revamped recommendations that call for everyone — vaccinated or not — to wear masks indoors in public settings in certain circumstances, a federal health official said."
27369,That official told The Post that the data will be published in full on Friday.
27370,"CDC Director Rochelle Walensky privately briefed members of Congress on Thursday, drawing on much of the material in the document."
27371,So it appears that tomorrow the data for the new requirements is gonna be published.
27372,"I'm curious to see what it says, cause reading both the article and the document it is saying the same things as what has been said, very much more likely to get hospitalized/die if vaccinated, not 100% perfect especially among elderly/immunocompromised."
27373,"A few concerning points is that Delta is apparently just as transmissible as chickenpox and even more transmissible than the flu, Ebola, smallpox, SARS/MERS, and the cold."
27374,Plus it says on a slide that Delta can apparently las longer than the previous variants and can cause reinfection at a higher rate.
27375,And the fact they think it can be even more severe and cause more harmful symptoms in vaccinated people is not good.
27376,Have you not been paying attention the past 16 months?
27377,Social pressure doesn’t do shit.
27378,No you are right.
27379,Chase money go into an easy profession like IT and contract.
27380,"The biggest lie is finding something you love, just be content with something you don't hate."
27381,It would be interesting to know what portion of this is a direct result of the nursing shortage.

27383,"His dad has been fine, no symptoms."
27384,A few other family members are having mild symptoms.
27385,My 83 year old grandmother being the worst so far.
27386,She's having a lot of fatigue and dizziness and flu like symptoms.
27387,If I were you I would isolate as much as you can and make sure you are all wearing masks if you have to go out.
27388,My nephew has a genetic disorder and he we tried everything too.
27389,He's doing good though.

27393,"I am a teacher in LA county (not LAUSD, though) and I agree completely."
27394,Going up though is the point.
27395,"Here's a link a that states that cognitive decline is present even in those who haven't been hospitalized (which is colloquially referred to as ""mild"" cases) https://www.webmd.com/lung/news/20201028/study-shows-covid-19-may-cause-brain-aging   And we already know that vaccinated people can be infected and experience mild symptoms."
27396,Same.
27397,We had a meeting today that made it should like remote until at least 2022 (were supposed to go back after Labor Day as well)
27398,Man I’d really like to see a source on that.
27399,Not to say I don’t believe you but those are striking numbers.
27400,"Especially considering the vaccine is free and offered at every grocery store, pharmacy, hospital, etc."
27401,No way these people can’t find a place doing shots on their days off.
27402,Just let us get our kids vaccinated and the rest of the population kill each other off
27403,“Universal masking for source control and prevention” sounds like mask mandates might be a thing again.
27404,Just a guess.

27415,I wonder if the vaccine mandate applies to people doing drive-through.
27416,That's simply unacceptable to a large portion of humanity (including me).
27417,Let’s see what the CDC releases.
27418,"So far, no study has shown transmission from a vaccinated person to a vaccinated person."
27419,"Vaccinated people can definitely catch Covid, but without this big pool of selfish, self centered unvaccinated people the virus just wouldn’t be circulating at the rate it is."
27420,Not killing your family also has to be up there.

27423,Our insanely Trumpian Governor has authorized our universities to have completely nicotine free campuses.
27424,"Yet, he mandates that they can't require masks or vaccines, even indoors."
27425,"And has ordered full return to work, even for IT."
27426,"If this was about 'Freedom from Government', this wouldn't be the case."
27427,"Hell, if this was about economics, they'd be scrambling to shut down again and stop this crap NOW."
27428,"No, it's about kissing Trump's ass, hoping for a future endorsement."

27431,"Yeah I do, I’ll make an appointment with them."
27432,Leaning towards just getting it.
27433,Thanks!
27434,Don’t get me started on corporate greed in America.
27435,So those not vaccinated won’t be working and those vaccinated will be and also will be forced to wear masks for the unvaccinated.

27444,We live in the dark ages.
27445,"In Israel where over 84% of adults are vaccinated, 40% of their latest cases were in vaccinated individuals."
27446,Vaccination reduces transmission which is great but its not stopping this virus from spreading.
27447,"Meanwhile there's billions around the globe, most in third world countries that currently have little or no access to vaccines and variants that develop in those countries can make it around the world in less than a day."
27448,"Vaccination in high numbers in the US and other Western nations will save lives, reduce the number of total infections and somewhat reduce the number of potential new variants but it isn't going to stop it."
27449,"If we get to boosters, they’ll basically be interchangeable."
27450,Moderna was throwing out the idea of combining it with the flu shot.
27451,That would be my preference if we get to that point.
27452,Boom.
27453,Right there he should lose his tax exempt status.
27454,"He’s running a political organization, not a church."
27455,Also- this dude’s a moron.
27456,Hmmmm I wonder why 🤔
27457,"Remember folks, masks are to capture what you are about to exhale."
27458,"If vaccinated individuals are carrying Delta, then all of us need to be masked."
27459,You get downvoted for cherry picking anecdotes out of millions and millions of transmissions event around the country and world and pretend these anecdotes prove breakthrough infection is “common”
27460,You were doing decent up until the last paragraph.
27461,Rapists are much much worse than an antivax Facebooker.
27462,We have a receptionist at our practice dealing with the same thing.
27463,She's been in tears some days because she can't remember how to do some things that used to be a daily occurrence for her.
27464,It's given her some pretty intense depression and anxiety about making a mistake.
27465,Just losing knowledge that was second nature in your mid thirties is quite jarring.
27466,She's about 10 months post infection.
27467,"I'll reserve judgement until I see the data, but I'm pretty sure they're just going to say that vaccinated people *who become ill* with Delta can still spread it."
27468,"Like, how obvious was that?"
27469,The point of the vaccine is that it drastically reduces your chance of becoming ill in the first place.
27470,It's ridiculous how they're trying to scare people here.
27471,Feel free to search [state by state](https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#hospitalizations) to see that you are simply wrong.
27472,This new wave isn't going to hit every state at once.
27473,There are plenty of states seeing increases in hospitalization that rival last winter and summer.
27474,It's best to learn from the mistakes of the early states rather than wait to learn the hard way.
27475,You do understand the virus is mutating
27476,[removed]
27477,"Not “overblown,” exactly; because the potential clotting side effect is pretty serious."
27478,But it is very rare.
27479,"I think if I were in your position, I would probably take it, because your risk with the virus (which also causes clotting problems at a much higher rate than the vaccine,) is pretty high as an essential worker."

27482,A lot of people don't have weekends or have scattered days off.
27483,They might work 5 hour days 6 or 7 days a week.
27484,They might have two jobs and no days off.
27485,"Weekends are a privilege, not something a lot of working class or low-income people are given or can afford."
27486,This is just so stupidly entitled.
27487,I'm over it.
27488,It's not a job.
27489,It was a free vaccine you got that made you and those around significantly safer.
27490,That's reward enough.
27491,The goal is to get people vaccinated.
27492,Not to submit to some arbitrary definition of fairness.
27493,Comparing this to a job is asinine and in bad faith.
27494,I honestly feel that might work
27495,"The vaccines do give increased protection from infection, its just that the amount they give appears to be lost in the noise of the 1000x viral loads of the Delta variant."
27496,"I expect the CDC to make an announcement tomorrow that's going to surprise people in terms of how likely they are to get Delta COVID if they don't take significant precautions, even if they are fully vaxxed."
27497,"Lol shit, here in Florida at least south Florida, it's more rare to find someone who didn't get the jab."
27498,I just scheduled one through CVS for the weekend.
27499,My first round of shots was through the VA so I doubt there's any way for them to know.
27500,We shall see.
27501,"Soon: “waiting fda approval

27536,Can I get a second shot and get paid?
27537,life is not fair I guess?
27538,I suppose we could go back in time and make stimulus check require a vaccine receipt to be cashed.
27539,Or do a similar tie-in with unemployment assistance
27540,And make the medical debt non-dischargeable with bankruptcy.
27541,Exactly.
27542,If there's no real world consequences to these people not getting the vaccine then how will they ever learn unless they ultimately end up getting severe COVID and by then it's too late?
27543,Thanks my sister did it.
27544,Thanks a lot Florida.
27545,just because you got a vaccine doesn't mean its over.

27555,"Some of the lowest % of vaccinated folks here in NJ are from our major cities where it is hugely, hugely, Democratic."
27556,Why we don't have major out reach programs in these areas is really confusing to me.
27557,We need to reach these communities and have programs explaining the safety of these vaccines because these communities do not trust them.

27571,It Was all a dream afterall.. amazing movie
27572,I'm the custodial parent of a 15 year who wants to get the vaccine.
27573,They're at their dads this summer.
27574,I may have to not tell the dad bc he's pressuring my child not to get the vaccine.
27575,Their Grammy is also convinced it will make magnets stick to their skin.
27576,🙄 So do I deal with a huge fight or just get it done?
27577,Can that be retroactively paid as well for people that actually got it when they were supposed to?
27578,🙂
27579,You sound like the people that don't want student loan forgiveness because they already paid off their student loans.
27580,You know what matters more than anything right now?
27581,That vaccinations go up.
27582,"If vaccinations go up, I don't give a flying fuck that someone else got a $100 and I didn't for a vaccine that a lot of the world doesn't even have access to."
27583,This is so childish.
27584,I assume they were using IFR as opposed to CFR.
27585,"If you're thinking anything they do was going to make sense, you haven't been paying attention."
27586,:-)
27587,Let them quit id kill for a government job
27588,That seems to make more sense.
27589,"I don’t see why people on the right would get vaccinated in secret, since it seems that most people on the right are telling everyone to do whatever they want, because it’s a personal choice."
27590,But there are plenty of people on the left who are vaccine-hesitant who don’t want to be eaten alive by their own party and admit that they are unvaccinated.
27591,It just makes so much more sense for there to be a greater number of people who are unvaccinated and lying about it.
27592,I am also starting to wonder about the number of breakthrough cases that are being reported.

27601,I like your hair.
27602,In the UK most of the clinically extremely vulnerable have been vaccinated for about 5 months and life is completely reopen.
27603,Today the CDC recommended getting tested for covid even if you are vaccinated and feeling no symptoms.
27604,"So does that mean that, previously, it wasn't recommended for vaccinated people to bother getting tested?"
27605,"I want to hope for best case scenario, but I wonder if this ""17 times"" is partly a function of vaccinated people not being advised to get tested."

27614,Or maybe I wrote it badly.
27615,My point is that the vaccines we have at the present time are not going to magically bring about an end to the pandemic anytime soon.
27616,"That's not to say they aren't valuable and won't save a lot of lives, but I think lots of people were expecting a more dramatic effect, something that would quickly put the covid pandemic in the rearview mirror and transport us back to 2019."
27617,I really don't want any more q tips shoved up my nose..does anybody?
27618,The last few days have been a complete shitshow of bad decisons.

27623,I think the same place in the brain where your taste and smell are processed is called the ganglia but also functions your central nervous system.
27624,Some how that becomes inflamed or covid gets in there and wrecks you.
27625,My central nervous system was screwed about a week after I thought I was getting better.
27626,My eyes stuck in dark mode everything was so bright my digestion almost completely shut down my blood pressure was not being regulated so my heart rate would sky rocket when I walked to the kitchen and I’d almost pass out my body just kept urinating like crazy I kept getting dehydrated the ER and docs kept checking to see if I was diabetic because of the symptoms I were describing when I would fall asleep my body would jolt me awake I suspect because my HR would drop so low so quick as I feel asleep any mental stimulation would shut down all my body functions my central nervous system took care of.
27627,I am way better now but I’m still chronically ill but hey I don’t think I’m dying every moment of everyday like I did for 6-9 months I just feel like crap and I am able to do something I enjoy!
27628,It’s terrible I was starting my 13 year as a cable tech now I’m on disability.
27629,I tell my story to inform people this is a bad way to end up get vaccinated wear a mask and only go out if it absolutely necessary a few years of being bored is ok because eventually you can live you life again when this is over!

27635,Looks like LA county schools are mandating testing for students and staff weekly.

27641,It really hurts because otherwise she's awesome in every other way.

27643,The rest either refuse to get it or do so grudgingly for work or travel.

27648,Love him!
27649,Vaccines are still working and helping prevent a majority of vaccinated people get hospitalised if they are unlucky to catch covid so highly doubt another lockdown.
27650,Aslong as vaccines do their job remember it won't prevent everyone dyin/being hospitalised but should prevent large majority.

-	Getting a third shot of Pfizer or Moderna could result in stronger adverse affects than your second shot had
-	It might also encourage a more muted response from your body when it does come in contact with COVID later on

More is not necessarily more here, so if you are able to wait for guidance on boosters, that is probably your best bet."

27916,Masks can be made of different materials and designs (66) which influence their filtering capability.
27917,There are two considerations when looking at efficacy: 1) the filtration of the material and 2) the fit of the design.
27918,"There are many standards around the world for both of these issues, such as the US National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) N95 classification."
27919,"The “95” designation means that, when subjected to testing, the respirator blocks at least 95% of very small (0.3 μm) test particles."
27920,"NIOSH tests at flow rates of 85 L/min, simulating a high work rate, which is an order of magnitude higher than rest or low-intensity breathing."
27921,"These are designed to be tests of the worst case (i.e., it produces maximum filter penetration), because the test conditions are the most severe that are likely to be encountered in a work environment (85)."
27922,"These tests use particles that are much smaller than virus-carrying emissions, at much higher flow rates than normally seen in community settings, which means that masks that do not meet this standard may be effective as PPE in the community."
27923,"The machines used for these studies are specifically designed for looking at respirators that hold their shape, which are glued or attached with beeswax firmly to the testing plate."
27924,"Flexible masks such as cloth and surgical masks can get pulled into the hole in the testing plate, which makes it a less suitable testing method for these designs."
27925,"A study of filtration using the NIOSH approach (86), but with 78-nm particles, was used as the basis for a table in World Health Organization’s “Advice on the use of masks in the context of COVID-19” (87)."
27926,"There was over 90% penetration for all cotton masks and handkerchiefs, and 50 to 60% penetration for surgical masks and nonwoven nonmedical masks."
27927,Zhao et al.
27928,"(88) used a similar approach, but at a lower 32 L/min (which is still 3 to 6 times higher than human ventilation during light work)."
27929,"They also tested materials after creating a triboelectric effect by rubbing the material with a latex glove for 30 s, finding that polyester achieved a quality factor (Q) of 40 kP/a, nearly 10 times higher than a surgical mask."
27930,"Without triboelectric charging, it achieved a Q of 6.8, which was similar to a cotton t-shirt."
27931,"They concluded that cotton, polyester, and polypropylene multilayered structures can meet or even exceed the efficiency of materials used in some medical face masks."
27932,"However, it depends on the details of the material and treatment."
27933,"One recent study looked at the aerosol filtration efficiency of common fabrics used in respiratory cloth masks, finding that efficacy varied widely, from 12 to 99.9%, at flow rates lower than at-rest respiration (89)."
27934,"Many materials had ≥96% filtration efficacy for particles of &gt;0.3 μm, including 600 threads per inch cotton, cotton quilt, and cotton layered with chiffon, silk, or flannel."
27935,A combination of materials was more effective than the materials on their own.
27936,"These findings support studies reported in 1926 by Wu Lien Teh (4), which described that a silk face covering with flannel added over the mouth and nose was highly effective against pneumonic plague."
27937,"There are many designs of cloth masks, with widely varying levels of fit."
27938,There have been few tests of different designs.
27939,"A simple mask cut from a t-shirt achieved a fit score of 67, offering substantial protection from the challenge aerosol and showing good fit with minimal leakage (90)."
27940,"One study looked at unfitted surgical masks, and used three rubber bands and a paper clip to improve their fit (91)."
27941,All 11 subjects in the test passed the N95 fit test using this approach.
27942,"Wu Lien Teh noted that a rubber support could provide good fit, although he recommended that a silk covering for the whole head (and flannel sewed over nose and mouth areas), with holes for the eyes, tucked into the shirt, is a more comfortable approach that can provide good protection for a whole day (4)."
27943,Research focused on aerosol exposure has found all types of masks are at least somewhat effective at protecting the wearer.
27944,Van der Sande et al.
27945,"(78) found that “all types of masks reduced aerosol exposure, relatively stable over time, unaffected by duration of wear or type of activity,” and concluded that “any type of general mask use is likely to decrease viral exposure and infection risk on a population level, despite imperfect fit and imperfect adherence.”

The review from Chu et al."
27946,"(11) included three observational studies of face mask use for SARS-CoV-2 in health care environments, all showing a risk ratio of 0.03 to 0.04."
27947,"However, these studies were given a much lower weight in the review than studies of Middle East respiratory syndrome and SARS, and the overall risk ratio for mask use in health care was estimated at 0.30."
27948,"One of the most frequently mentioned, but misinterpreted, papers evaluating cloth masks as PPE for health care workers is one from MacIntyre et al."
27949,(25).
27950,"The study compared a “surgical mask” group, which received two new masks per day, to a “cloth mask” group that received five masks for the entire 4-wk period and were required to wear the masks all day, to a “control group,” which used masks in compliance with existing hospital protocols, which the authors describe as a “very high level of mask use.” There was not a “no mask” control group because it was deemed “unethical.” The study does not inform policy pertaining to public mask wearing as compared to the absence of masks in a community setting."
27951,"They found that the group with a regular supply of new surgical masks each day had significantly lower infection of rhinovirus than the group that wore a limited supply of cloth masks, consistent with other studies that show surgical masks provide poor filtration for rhinovirus, compared to seasonal coronaviruses (67)."
27952,"Most of the research on masks as health worker PPE focuses on influenza, though it is not yet known to what extent findings from influenza studies apply to COVID-19 filtration."
27953,Wilkes et al.
27954,(92) found that “filtration performance of pleated hydrophobic membrane filters was demonstrated to be markedly greater than that of electrostatic filters.” A metaanalysis of N95 respirators compared to surgical masks (93) found “the use of N95 respirators compared with surgical masks is not associated with a lower risk of laboratory-confirmed influenza.” Radonovich et al.
27955,"(94) found, in an outpatient setting, that “use of N95 respirators, compared with medical masks in the outpatient setting resulted in no significant difference in the rates of laboratory-confirmed influenza.”

One possible additional benefit of masks as PPE is that they do not allow hands to directly touch the nose and mouth, which may be a transmission vector."
27956,"The lipid barrier that protects viruses is destroyed within 5 min of touching the hands (95), and wearing a mask during that period could be protective."
27957,"However, there are no case reports or laboratory evidence to suggest that touching the mask can cause infection."
27958,"Overall, it appears that cloth face covers can provide good fit and filtration for PPE in some community contexts, but results will vary depending on material and design, the way they are used, and the setting in which they are used."
27959,Why would we want to save anyone who would be amenable to that?

You're right that these protests are happening in other European countries as well, and it is an international embarrassment."
28005,"To consider ourselves the ""center"" of attention right now and to be acting this way towards a vaccine is possibly the most ridiculous thing I have ever had to witness thus far (and I believe there will only be more strange things to come as time passes... they always do)"
28006,Yep.
28007,"A lot of places specifically don’t ask for any IDs because they want everyone, including undocumented immigrants, to get them."

28010,Pretty much my take too.
28011,Vaccinated and masking
28012,Welcome.
28013,"I, and others, have been hating them since about April..April of 2020."
28014,But it is far from useless against infection as the data shows.
28015,Remember before these vaccines were released and Fauci said he would be happy with 60 percent effectiveness?
28016,Now I think like you said the fight is going to be getting more people to take these vaccines.
28017,"You are right, we can’t afford to leave it at 50 percent."
28018,Also protection against hospitalization is higher than 83 percent in the study.
28019,That sucks.
28020,Their insurance support may have a word about that.
28021,He must be a senior leader in ANTIVA.
28022,I feel like they're just testing less symptom-less people than other states.
28023,"Arkansas, Florida, Louisiana, and Mississippi all have greater rates of new COVID cases this week."
28024,"Its because supposedly during Bear Week in P-Town, there was a covid outbreak amongst vaccinated people which lead the CDC to believe that while the vaccine is still extremely EXTREMELY effective against hospitalizations and deaths, it might not be as effective against transmission with the delta variant."
28025,"&gt;Imagine letting your boss control your personal health decisions

Just wait until you hear about our wonderful healthcare system where you boss has full control over your health insurance"
28026,&gt;If vaccines work then why are the vaccinated scared of the unvaccinated?
28027,Yeah I'm not scared.
28028,I will lick a sample of COVID-19 if you will lol.
28029,I'm not scared *of* you.
28030,"A part of me is scared *for* you, but I feel like my innate empathy is wasted on you at the same time."
28031,"There is some anger at this point, since we could be moving on from this much more quickly if you didn't drink so much kool-aid."
28032,"My friend has lupus, and couldn't get her medicine for a while because ya'll would rather *pay* for hydroxychloroquine than get a *free* vaccine."
28033,"And the vaccines are safer than hydroxychloroquine - many 'safe' and 'effective' drugs are pretty terrible for you, and it's no exception:

&gt;Serious reported neuropsychiatric adverse effects of hydroxychloroquine use include agitation, mania, difficulty sleeping, hallucinations, psychosis, catatonia, paranoia, depression, and suicidal thoughts."
28034,"Hydroxychloroquine has been implicated in cases of serious skin reactions such as Stevens–Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis, and Drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms."
28035,"Reported blood abnormalities with its use include lymphopenia, eosinophilia, and atypical lymphocytosis."
28036,Wanting to take *that* instead of the (much safer) vaccine is a little bonkers IMO.
28037,"Even if prevents death, it is not better or safer or cheaper or as accessible as the vaccine."
28038,"It also (most importantly IMO) doesn't reduce the likelihood of giving your COVID to grandma, grandpa, or my friend with lupus."
28039,Personally I don't want to be responsible for anyone's death - whatever the likelihood - but I guess YMMV.
28040,"I get it - I too was a devout contrarian once, but that wasn't me living my best life."
28041,Getting the vaccine is not the end of the world or as big a deal as you think it is.
28042,"Honestly I wouldn't force it on you, but please try not to spread your COVID if/when you do end up getting it."
28043,"I honestly don't know why I should, but I'd do the same for you."
28044,Vaccines are still effective.
28045,So we need more people to get them.
28046,Vaccine mandates/requirements will become the norm now.
28047,France and UK are already doing the equivalent of it (i.e.
28048,make life difficult for unvaxxed folks).
28049,Many companies and city/state governments in the US are already doing it.
28050,"Nobody's surprised, right?"
28051,"Yep, I know someone who regularly visits Germany for business as his company is based there."
28052,He said he knew several Germans that flew over just to get vaccinated in the USA.
28053,Who is paying for this?
28054,"Yes, obviously the vaccine is very safe or the US wouldn't let people use it, but that's not the information antivax people are going to see."
28055,&gt;  In no way “filled” as the article claims.
28056,"The article does not contain the word ""filled""."
28057,"You are reading too much into the word ""fills"" in the headline - it's not saying the beds are *filled*, it's saying that the Delta variant *is filling* them, which it is."
28058,"It's *filling* them, but they're not yet *filled*."
28059,"""Fills"" was perhaps not the best choice of word for clarity, but that's how headlines are written."
28060,"Headline are sometimes ambiguous, by nature of the limited space, hence the tendency for short words and ""action"" verbs (""SLAMS"", ""DESTROYS"") which overall make for a hyperbolic mode of expression."
28061,Knuckle draggers
28062,An ignoble fate.
28063,This is so fucked up
28064,The CDC now believes the effectiveness of the vaccines against infection is 75-85 percent against delta.
28065,Not super great but far from useless or square one or anything.
28066,I remember when Fauci said a vaccine with 60 percent effectiveness would be great.
28067,Yo your doctor dumb AF
28068,It’s not a question of how many.
28069,It’s a question of how long.
28070,"They need 12 month trial data, and that’s being done right now."
28071,Y’all I’ve been using the NYT to get my case counts but this afternoon they updated and they don’t match state reported numbers.
28072,Ex Missouri state reported they had 2k cases while the NYT report says 5k.
28073,What do you all use for your case counts?
28074,There was plenty of evidence.

28080,"I'm young and vaccinated, and I already survived having the virus."
28081,"I am not even remotely scared for myself, and I'm not particularly scared for other vaccinated people either, given the *extremely* low hospitalization and death rates among the vaccinated."
28082,"What I'm concerned about is the continuing spread of the virus, its potential to keep mutating, its potential to kill immunocompromised people, and yes, its potential to continue killing unvaccinated people."
28083,"Sure, the majority of unvaccinated people have made their choice to take the risk, but that doesn't mean I want them to die."
28084,It's not about being scared for myself.
28085,"That's also not why I wear a mask (some people *still* don't understand that the purpose of masks, with the exception of N95s and such, is to protect others from you, not vice versa)."
28086,I'm not afraid of getting COVID.
28087,I'm concerned for the people who are still at risk from greatly suffering and dying from it.
28088,Smoke is like hundreds of times smaller than viral particles (not to mention ones that are contained in droplets or exhaled moisture).

28173,Regarding long term studies on the vaccines… several of them are based on vaccine tech that’s been used for decades.
28174,The main thing that would cause any deleterious effects would be from the non-active ingredients (eg the solution that carries the vaccine itself and preservatives).
28175,So you can look at decades of data about that.
28176,"For the mRNA vaccines, they have been tested for many years for other viruses and the again, the only parts that could cause bad reactions would be from the buffering solution and preservatives."

28504,The article is based on some leaked quotes so not the most cohesive.
28505,Bit about \*vaccinated people transmitting just as much as unvaccinated\* is certainly a blow (to people who don't frequent this sub or keep up with all that information at least.
28506,I'm always surprised I have friends who are just now learning vaccinated people can even get infected at all.)
28507,"That post says over 1/3 didn't get an mRna vaccine, could be part of it."
28508,The numbers I know are for Pfizer and Moderna
28509,Here's the [breakdown](https://i.imgur.com/QSnMV6k.jpg) of cases in the last 14 days by age and vaccination status.
28510,"There are kids being affected by Delta, but we don't have anyone needing supplementary oxygen or in the ICU below 18 years of age."
28511,Hospitalizations are not a great measure in Singapore because we do a lot of pre-emptive hospitalization in case someone is asymptomatic but perceived to be at risk of severe outcomes.

28514,Pity is as much as he'll get from me for all the harm he's done.
28515,Hey .. it is a free country and a free state.
28516,"A business should have the freedom to choose whom to do business with, as long as we are not violating federal discrimination law (i.e."
28517,behavior based).
28518,I cannot wear jeans and shorts to a restaurant with a dress code.
28519,Why is it different with vaccine and masks?
28520,"Great, now go tell my family this."
28521,Does Covid have some kind of lobbying power in the Republican Party or something??
28522,Because the only benefitting from this BS is the virus.
28523,Ok but Reddit told me their medical system is like 1000000x better than ours in the USA
28524,&gt;Just a general feeling of nothing will ever be right.
28525,That's exactly how I would describe it.
28526,Crazy.
28527,Thanks for posting your experiences!
28528,"No matter how it looks, these numbers are useless for both negative and positive claims if you don't know which amount of people was exposed in what way."

28535,*
28536,"Yeah, like no one else got hit until after treatments or vaccines came out."
28537,To fuck around is human.
28538,To find out is divine.
28539,"I live in Portugal, where the Delta variant already took over and is responsible for 99% of all covid cases."
28540,We have about 50% of population fully vaxxed and about 70% with at least one dose.
28541,Covid cases are dropping and vaccines are avoiding deaths.
28542,Breakthrough cases hit some of the most fragile people (who may need a third dose) but vaccines are preventing deaths and hospitalization.
28543,About a month and a half ago I kept posting here about how Delta rendered vaccines useless because that was all we were getting fed by the media.
28544,Reality proved otherwise.
28545,The virus will become endemic and the vaccines allow that.
28546,You won't avoid getting covid by getting vaxxed.
28547,But you will probably have an asymptomatic or really mild case.
28548,And natural immunity will be reached without filling hospitals.
28549,That's the end goal.
28550,Covid won't go away.
28551,It will become a virus that circulates and we get once in a while.
28552,And the most fragile will need yearly boosters to prevent death.
28553,"Calm down, trust the vaccines and don't get anxious."
28554,Things will get better
28555,"&gt;or which the 

The Quoting seems wacked out on this reply so forgive that."
28556,This is for cosmicrae.
28557,"&amp;#x200B;

I actually don't know what the situation was like."
28558,Sturgis seems a good comparison.
28559,Just from my gay male compadres I would assume gay men are pretty contact heavy (for a better word) then say a large group of men and woman would be.
28560,As a man I may not be gay but I certainly understand the male sex drive.
28561,This would be a good CDC rec for large gatherings for sure like sturgis as you said.
28562,Feel free to correct me I don't mean to be insulting!
28563,Yeah...
28564,Cause they got hit first and didn't have a vaccine or a variety of other treatments available.
28565,&gt; stay home with our son to keep him safe or get health insurance in case one of us gets Covid?
28566,Ugh.
28567,I'm sorry you had to make that tough decision.
28568,One of the many reasons I hate our employer-based healthcare system.
28569,"You are countering a point I’m not making, and using an argument that doesn’t apply."
28570,"You’re saying “everyone’s vaccinated, so of course a greater proportion of cases”."
28571,I get that.
28572,But that isn’t what I’m saying.
28573,Someone was saying “most vaccinated people won’t be symptomatic”.
28574,"In this quite large instance, they were."
28575,I don’t know what you’re on about lol.
28576,One more time might not make a difference either way.
28577,"On the other hand, drinking at home is cheaper, and the bar tender is more attractive."
28578,Second shot for us J&amp;J people.
28579,This doesn't show that vaccines aren't effective against the delta variant.
28580,At all.
28581,"&gt;You can acknowledge that breakthrough infection means fuck all,

If it wasn't the delta variant, I would say you are correct."
28582,But it now looks like breakthrough infected vaccinated people can also spread it.
28583,"And if they can spread it, that means more hospitalizations and deaths among the unvaccinated."
28584,That's the difference.
28585,We have more people that can spread it than we previously thought.
28586,"You are right that it doesn't actually change that much, except more indoor masking compliance."
28587,Is there any evidence the vaccine would ever help kids?
28588,I thought lack of that evidence is one of the major reason's it's not approved for them.
28589,So why sit around wondering when it's going to be approved when it's hard to even measure if it's going to be effective.
28590,Nothing seems to point to it being a major solution.
28591,"But but tucker carlson said …

/s"
28592,"&gt; I have a degree in statistics and work as an analyst ...

Appeal to authority is a logical fallacy."
28593,&gt;  I'm well aware of how this works.
28594,"Claiming that you can hide a spike or trends with an average is absolutely incorrect unless you are looking for something like a 3-day ""spike"" - which is basically irrelevant when talking about long term trends."
28595,"That's a long way of saying ""I admit I'm wrong"" particularly since hiding a shorter term spike is EXACTLY what I was talking about and not just about COVID."
28596,"There are plenty of examples of rapid sampling governments do where they tried to hide the sharp measured rise in nitrates, pollution, radiation, etc."
28597,that was a clear and discernible rise with non-random fluctuations but could be washed out with a longer average and delayed reports.
28598,Interestingly - if you look at the fact that COVID has a 3-5 day incubation period you start to see a rise in rates starting on day 3 of a superspreader event with a discernible spike happening in 5-7 days and a second one in 10-14 days.
28599,"Which ... is EXACTLY what was seen with the DAILY reporting after elections in MI and several other states, seen with the sturgis event in SD, etc."
28600,etc.
28601,etc.
28602,"&gt; There's a reason almost all meaningful Covid reporting uses rolling, weekly averages and not daily fluctuations."
28603,"Hey, I fucked up?"
28604,The population percentages are of people who are vaccinated.
28605,"So it’s really:

-	39% Pfizer (34% of cases)
-	26% Moderna (28% of cases)
-	5% J&amp;J (12% of cases)
-	30% no vaccine (26% of cases)

This is a single event, so you can’t really use it do draw conclusions on vaccine efficacy."
28606,No bro it’s 90-95% against infection.
28607,CDC said so.
28608,They are never wrong or late.
28609,Stop trying to think for yourself.
28610,The case studies are bulletproof
28611,Remeber when we started this for the greater good but now un-vaxxed deaths are 100% Okay and even encouraged on this sub.
28612,Lol how quick the tune changes
28613,You have a good point there.
28614,Definitely don't get a 3rd dose in a foreign land where you are not a naturalized citizen.
28615,"I'm in the US and I was born here, so I don't feel there is a risk of being deported."
28616,"I'm 45 years old, diabetic, and, by medical definition, obese."
28617,"With the rates of infection by Delta, numbers of people in hospital/ICU, among other scary stats about Delta, I figured it was a risk worth taking to get the 3rd dose."
28618,I don't think I'm entitled or anything.
28619,"I don't think I'm special, but with the way Americans just run to the front of the line as soon as a line forms and cause backups and shortages, I felt like going now would be helpful."
28620,It will keep me safe and in turn keep everyone else safe around me.
28621,"The best answer is protecting the kids, we all want them outside, healthy, and able to develop healthy social skills but  we CANNOT pretend like there isn't an inherent danger in pretending like their world is normal when we KNOW that our adult world is not."
28622,"Is the ""right"" answer locking up the kids?"
28623,No but the right answer isn't risking them choking to death  on their own  fluids if we can avoid it either .
28624,And a great many of those employees qualify for food stamps and medical as well as other state supports...  rather than a livable wage
28625,"It's totally meaningless, and you would know that with a basic grasp of statistics."
28626,The release of this study is a horrific misstep by the CDC.
28627,It's infuriating.
28628,"Just like the virus and zombies, the stupid die in waves."
28629,Shortness of breath is a severe symptom.
28630,That’s not common in the vaccinated.
28631,My internet has been shitty since I got my vaccine.
28632,I'm not sure how to access my microchip for the free 5G.
28633,"While I recognize that the commenter does not post data to back up their claim ""same people who donate to medical gofundmes are the same ones who oppose universal health care"" - Your sole experience wouldn't confirm/refute any correlation that did exist."
28634,Thank you for the response.
28635,Do you happen to know which study cites a reduced viral load with asymptomatic cases?
28636,I’m on mobile and doing a quick search there are articles that state the opposite.
28637,I am not sure if delta is different in this regard.
28638,this guy should be impeached asap
28639,"Even if you get it heaven forbid, its almost a guaretee you wont be hospitalized, stock up on some chicken soup and gatorade just in case"
28640,"Ordering more food sounds about right, usually turns things around for me too 👍 but so weird!"
28641,Just a general feeling of nothing will ever be right.
28642,Which is not my normal take on life.
28643,"Yikes, did someone make a typo entering the data on this?"
28644,What's the deal?
28645,We’re at 71% with one dose for 50-64 age group.
28646,Higher for &gt;65 age group.
28647,https://usafacts.org/visualizations/covid-vaccine-tracker-states/
28648,masks.. get vaxxed and mask up.
28649,that's the only way.
28650,"don't be silly, the headline says he was texting from his hospital bed after dead, so he hasn't ascended"
28651,How many kids die every year in a car seat?
28652,"9000 kids under the age of 12 die every year in car crashes, lets say half had a car seat and 4500 died in one."
28653,That’s still over 25-30x the amount of kids who have died in the USA from coronavirus.
28654,(About 200) Both were “preventable” yet stuff happens anyway.
28655,"It sounds callous, but shutting down society because people die is moronic and without a clear end."
28656,I'm sure in a few years from now people will be getting covid or flu and just calling either one flu.
28657,I think that there's zero guidance or pushback from government on bringing people back into offices is even worse.
28658,An argument can be made for in person schooling being necessary with the right mix of precautions.
28659,No argument can be made for stopping WFH if it's proven to be the same or better for the company and employees over the last year.
28660,"In most cases, it has been better."
28661,"If, for whatever reason, we have to choose between the two, then I think it's school all the way."
28662,But MANY NYC offices are opening in September and the vast majority of NYC commuters use trains and buses.
28663,"The old (not not new old, lol) Penn Station where NJ Transit commuters wait for track assignments and then enter narrow stairwells in droves for hours on end is one of the worst Petri dishes in America."
28664,So worse than even kids in school is their parents going to work when they're in school and those two potential vectors colliding on the daily.
28665,At least masks in school and limited outside gathering until vaccinations are approved under 12 has a bit of practice and control.
28666,Going back to work in offices where you sit for eight plus hours in poorly ventilated spaces on poorly ventilated transit systems that take HOURS with the slightest hiccup?
28667,"No thanks...

And just this week, Cuomo said that he would like all NYC businesses with office space to mandate a return after Labor Day."
28668,Here we go again...
28669,Pretty much any country 80%+ of people are willing to get vaccinated and they didn't let anywhere near as many people die in the past 18 months.
28670,"&gt;&gt;Walmart isn’t requiring all of its 1.6 million U.S. workers

Holy shit."
28671,The US has roughly 207 million working age adults.
28672,Just fudging the numbers mentally I'm coming up with a figure that suggests 1 in every ~120 people (working age) in this country work at Wal-Mart.
28673,Correct me if I'm wrong.
28674,That's insane.
28675,I don't want to get into a policy disagreement because that is counter to the sub's commenting rules.
28676,But I will say that I trust the thought leaders at CDC and I think we would all do well to amplify their bandwidth.
28677,Elimination will not happen.
28678,"Smallpox is the only disease we've wiped out, and that was only possible because it generated permanent immunity, so we just needed to dose each person once."
28679,"The same is true of diseases we've ""all-but-wiped-out"" in the first world."
28680,Polio and Measles are not a big bother for us because we just need one shot when we're kids and then we have permanent immunity.
28681,"We already know COVID-19 reinfection and breakthrough cases exist, so immunity is not lifelong."
28682,That alone makes it exponentially more difficult.
28683,Then there's the fact that COVID-19 can hang out in animal reservoirs.
28684,"We already know it can infect minks and cats, so there's probably already reservoirs of it out in the wild, e.g."
28685,among stray cat populations.
28686,Good luck getting the world to agree to a mass culling of cats.
28687,What's your source for vaccinated asymptomatic spread?
28688,Thotts and prerrs
28689,At my facility any healthcare worker that's vaccinated doesn't have to be tested.
28690,We don't have a vaccine mandate and tbh the testing mandate we have for unvaccinated workers and screenings are rarely enforced.
28691,My dept supervisor looked at me like I had 2 heads when I said I still get regularly tested on my own.
28692,I'm sure breakthrough cases are way more widespread than we even know.
28693,"I'm going to be furious if it turns out the CDC and current administration knew about the breakthrough infection risk as delta began to spread and, instead of doing the right thing, promoted an idea that it was fine to not wear a mask or get tested to coddle sociopathic anti-vaxxers and anti-maskers and pander for votes."
28694,We really need to keep the same energy between administrations and hold every single politician accountable for American lives and well-being in a public health crises.
28695,"I don't care how unpopular a mask mandate or vaccine mandate is, sometimes your job as a leader of an entire country is to do the unpopular thing if it saves lives."
28696,Nobody's getting vaccinated because of some cringe PSA they saw the first 5 seconds of on YouTube.
28697,What's the point of these leaders if they aren't doing anything REAL to safeguard public health?
28698,"I'm sick to death of going back to the same situation as last winter (or worse because at least we had financial protections in place to take the edge off, meager as they were) even though I did everything right."
28699,I'm over negotiating with biohazard redneck terrorists.
28700,I just want to go out and eat or see a movie or anything without the risk of long-covid wrecking me for the next 20 years.
28701,Stats are reassuring.
28702,"Even if 90% of vaxxed who get it are asymptomatic and / or mild enough that they don't get tested, the odds are overwhelmingly positive."
28703,I wish I could upvote this post more than once!
28704,There is a phrase for this
28705,"Dammit Reddit, I'm a doctor not a comedian"
28706,That’s so hard.
28707,I hope you get to figure something out and I am sure your wedding will be lovely no matter what!
28708,"Try to get a different mask, from another material, or something that touches your skin less."
28709,The proof is in the pudding!
28710,No.
28711,If there is another lockdown there won't be anything left to open back up.
28712,There is no chance of another wide spread lockdown with 70% of adults having one dos of the vax.
28713,"It's interesting that you mention that, because on day 3 of our illness, which is when the fatigue peaked, my partner and I were both in a state of crisis and despair about how overwhelmed we felt by our lives (big changes recently)."
28714,"We managed to catch ourselves and just say, today is weird, it will never be like this again, now let's order more food and wait this out, and things turned around."
28715,But there was a real mental health struggle there.
28716,This thing is weird.

28729,"I think they're done playing games with this, because of how it hurts the bottom line."
28730,It's a case where what's good for the corporations (people being vaccinated) is also good for the rest of us.
28731,I would imagine being isolated for 16 months was also a nightmare.

28738,"the vaccines were good enough to outright prevent infection with the original strain of covid, as variants emerged the vaccine had a tougher time dealing with the mutations in the virus."
28739,we still have enough trained immunity for the majority to be ok if infected and vaccinated.

28746,Yet they want to emphasize their stupid culture line.
28747,It’s bs.
28748,"For example in my case I could easily get two additional Pfizer shots here in Canada on top of the two I got in the US, but I'm not going to be dishonest about the prior doses I have received to the pharmacist."
28749,Especially since I'm here on a visa.

28755,Thank you for this insight.
28756,I actually agree.
28757,We've given too much freedom and choice for the past 18 months and guess what?

28767,"If you don't think there's still a very significant portion of their base devoted to him, then I have a bridge to sell you."
28768,You are killing people.
28769,It’s pretty cowardly to think that locking up kids for 2 years and neglecting education and socialization is no risk compared to something that’s twice as deadly as the flu.
28770,Less cases among the vaccinated (https://www.courant.com/coronavirus/hc-news-coronavirus-breakthrough-cases-hospitalizations-deaths-20210729-tlrp5fa5czg7jkf3s77vkqdtgu-story.html) as well as the fact that just being asymptomatic will mean you are less contagious than someone with symptoms.
28771,Viral load is not the only factor determining how contagious an individual is.

28779,We're getting Trump or we're getting DeSantis.
28780,"Right, but if a very smaller percentage of vaccinated infected people are being hospitalized, the infection rate becomes obsolete."
28781,"Our goal should be to minimize people dying and having serious complications from the virus, not having 0 new cases."
28782,New cases aren’t necessarily bad if vaccinated people are having mild symptoms and aren’t having health complications other than a sore throat.
28783,My son is under the care of an Infectious Disease and Cardiology team at our children's hospital (he had Kawasaki Disease earlier this year.)
28784,"Now, he is generally higher risk than the average kid because he is currently immunosuppressed, but his ID doctor called us in June as they were starting to see a rise in pediatric hospitalization with Delta."
28785,"The take aways were: adults in his life needed to be vaccinated to spend time with him, he and his brother should wear masks indoors and outdoors if people outside our household are present, we needed to continue to wear masks outside of the home as a precaution even if we were vaccinated."
28786,"This was before more info about Delta was available, so it really does seem like they had suspicion early on that this was happening."
28787,His doctor did seem relieved that we had already decided to not do any summer camps - but really only because it made mitigation strategies less complicated.

28791,"Before doc can finish answering the question, the crowd starts calling her a liar and boos her."
28792,The crowd then shouts out that people are being silenced.
28793,"An 80 yo woman remembers vaccines for different periods of time, has studied them etc, refuses to take the vaccine because she ""God-given immunity and antibodies."""
28794,She went off on a tangent really.
28795,Same woman asked why the gov't was allowing illegal aliens into the country to pass us the diseases.
28796,Why doesn't the health care department screen them first before allowing them into the country.
28797,(It was like she was blaming COVID on them.)
28798,"Then she asked why their ""Christian tax dollars"" where going towards the immigrants and not them?"
28799,The governor seemed to have died inside a bit.
28800,"My SO suddenly said, Let the virus have them."
28801,It is Darwinism at this point.
28802,"Unfortunately, he's not done."
28803,His influence is still enormous with a large part of their base.
28804,Better question is what is the rate of transmission among vaccinated people.
28805,Vaccinated people are spreading more due to not having symptoms so there’s that.
28806,I suppose it could.
28807,It is hard to say if other sovereign states would consider a person to be a health threat for getting a 3rd (or beyond) vaccination.
28808,I don't travel very much.
28809,"When I do I usually stick to within 2-4 states away, and I travel there by a car."
28810,"The last time I was on a plane was in 2018 to go to Portland, OR, and before that, it was probably 2009."

28820,I guess I stand by science but you making people needlessly worried based on Facebook articles is cool too.
28821,Literally its a production of a spike protein.
28822,If it had long term effects we would have seen it by now especially considering how many people have gotten the vaccine.

28847,And getting a 3 year old to wear a properly fitted N95 isn’t realistic either.
28848,School is kind of scary.
28849,Yeah but they have money and public support.
28850,Nobody cares.
28851,There isn’t an issue.
28852,"You’re super clever, fuckmuppet."
28853,"&gt; walk two steps to the left and sit down, then take off my mask."
28854,"You're supposed to lift the mask up to take bites, then put it back while you chew your food."
28855,And so that in the future they can boldly claim that the virus was a hoax and they were never vaccinated
28856,Yea I do.
28857,I think we need to invest more into our teachers and education in general
28858,"&gt;She (Dr. Jennifer Nuzoo of John Hopkins School of Health) discouraged organizations — like pro baseball teams — from doing surveillance testing among vaccinated people without symptoms, saying “it probably does more harm than good” in eroding public confidence."
28859,I do agree with this sentiment.
28860,Early on it was wise to play a bit of a shell game with breakthrough cases so as to keep motivation high for getting vaccinated.
28861,"Once the shell has become kind of transparent, though, and new data emerges--such as high viral load in vaccinated breakthroughs and clear cases of vaccinated people spreading it to each other--a different strategy is required."
28862,I think this is why we are seeing some scrambling this week.
28863,The important thing is to circle the wagons around whatever the official messaging is.
28864,It looks like the common theme is unvaccinated people are putting a big strain on the capabilities of the vaccine.
28865,That's what I'm going to go with anyway.
28866,"""gas was $3/gal last week now it's $2.50!"
28867,"i want a refund!"""
28868,If vaccines work then why are the vaccinated scared of the unvaccinated?
28869,Pooled testing.
28870,Usually one test bundle per class.
28871,I think this is very likely the plan.
28872,An update for you!
28873,They ended up giving me a monoclonal antibody infusion and discharged me a few hours ago.
28874,I entered the ER around 3am and left around 4pm.
28875,My oxygen levels were dropping and I was given an IV which sucked ass because the nurse missed my vein the first time on account of me shaking so much because they couldn’t give me a blanket since I had a fever and they didn’t have PPE gear??
28876,Which made no sense.
28877,"Basically struggling for air, freezing my ass off in a hospital gown in a closed off room."
28878,Here’s picture proof for the dipshit naysayer that commented https://imgur.com/a/hSRBZRM
28879,What in the fuck
28880,Ehh those people are fine sucking up all the welfare and food stamps they don’t need no government hand outs
28881,So when can we get our boosters (phizer)
28882,Winner.
28883,Winner!
28884,If he's not vaccinated... wow.
28885,I cannot imagine throwing away the opportunity of a lifetime that was likely the result of years of work.
28886,"I wish it was just them, here in Baltimore we have the lowest vaccination rate in the state and I promise you we have about 3 people who cheer on team red."
28887,Don’t worry… Tennessee is right behind you…
28888,"Fuck masks, if anything this should prompt vaccine mandates, not mask mandates."
28889,"More companies need to get the chutzpah to put their foot down and tell their employees and their customers they HAVE to get the shot, and if you dont, tough shit."
28890,You vaccinated?
28891,"Cool, mind your own business."
28892,Doesn’t work?
28893,Not my problem.
28894,"You make decisions for you, I’ll make decisions for me."
28895,Only one of us thinks we have the authority to demand what the other does or doesn’t do.
28896,It was easy to identify them when masks were mandatory.
28897,They would wear their mask under their nose.
28898,"Do you actually believe for one second that you can, in fact, fix stupid?"
28899,"Yes, I live here and never go to the doctor because of that."
28900,"I meant for vaccinated people who have felt like the pandemic was over, masking wasn't needed except in very specific situations, etc."
28901,[removed]
28902,Forgot the /s
28903,"I’m vaxxed, that’s your unrhethorical answer."
28904,"What we care about is whether we're going to be sick, or contagious."
28905,Clearly the answer is yes to both if we're not wearing our mask even among the vaccinated.
28906,The formalities of the medical definitions let's leave to the epidemiologists and pharma giants.
28907,Totally understand!
28908,"As a fellow Missourian, I just wanted to share that good news if you hadn't seen it ;)"
28909,"&gt; Also worth noting, CDC has not really provided the data they based their decision on."
28910,Contract tracing / case studies have proven the point.
28911,Nope.
28912,I for one am glad they are carefully reviewing the data and following the proper processes for fully approving the vaccine.
28913,"It ensures beyond reasonable doubt that the vaccines are safe and effective, and institutes trust in them."
28914,"The last thing we want, especially with such waning trust in government institutions, is the FDA to rush approval of the vaccines and potentially miss something."
28915,Even if it’s something that’s not a show stopper like “oh this specific group actually shouldn’t get it because they are high risk”.
28916,The only way to ensure full FDA approval to have any kind of meaningful impact is to have it done right and methodically.
28917,Give me 100 for getting vaccinated fully then.
28918,He's up for reelection soon.
28919,He knows he can't get votes from those of us who see this for what it is: a public health issue that requires public cooperation.
28920,So instead he's catering to the liberty-at-all-costs (restrictions apply) crowd.
28921,"Sadly, it will probably work."
28922,"As Maya Angelou said, ""People remember how you made them feel."""
28923,"And he knows exactly how to make his base feel good about themselves, even when they're doing everything wrong."

28928,They literally removed their masks and walked into the capitol immediately after Bidens announcement.
28929,When are you guys expecting to go back into the office?
28930,1.
28931,"Not talking about the US
2."
28932,You can't compare hospitalizations because we have a semi competent healthcare system and very few people were hospitalized.
28933,Covid patients are watched in communitry facilities then sent to a hospital if necessary.
28934,there were only like 5 deaths in covid in total.
28935,"the outbreaks here are more proving that outbreaks driven by vaccinated people are possible, therefore increasing the chance the virus mutates to get past the vaccine."
28936,&gt; Hope everyone enjoyed their 10 weeks of freedom!
28937,This is gonna depend on where you live.
28938,Many places won’t bring back mandates or restrictions no matter what.
28939,See Texas for example.
28940,"Say we are sending the doses to Mexico before they expire, and watch them line up..."
28941,"Just went to Alabama and can confirm that there was not one mask, zero social distancing, the restaurants looked packed, and generally absolutely no consideration whatsoever about the virus."
28942,They didn't even have the shields between cashier and customer.
28943,Nothing at all to indicate that there was a pandemic.
28944,Terrifying.
28945,"Worse case scenario, they could weld all the doors shut for a while."
28946,My company announced today you must be vaxxed to come back early.
28947,Our own CEO said every American should be vaccinated.
28948,So proud to work where I do.
28949,Look at the numbers of hospitalizations and deaths.
28950,Compare vaccinated vs non vaccinated.
28951,Look where the highest caseloads are vs vaccination rates.
28952,There’s your answer
28953,People simply don’t want it.
28954,It’s.
28955,That.
28956,Simple.
28957,You're deflecting the question.
28958,"&gt; However, this culture does not do well with the **general public, which is a bit more attuned to nuance** than your typical scientist,

This is satire, right?"
28959,"My brother is a doctor and his wife, a pharmacist."
28960,They tried this in NY and he saw a number of people asking if getting 5 vaccines in one day would make them sick.
28961,(Because you can’t ask for ID in NY???).
28962,"Anyway, you need a way to track it, or you will have people that sign up (and get) multiple vaccinations."
28963,You mean like Trump?
28964,Boo fucking hoo.
28965,Zero sympathy and patience with these people.
28966,How so?
28967,You don’t get to argue for the right to choose and freedom and all that and also argue that business doesn’t have the right to make choices on its own behalf (that aren’t discriminatory or otherwise corrupt).
28968,"Free market, don’t want to get the vaccine then work somewhere where the vaccine isn’t required."
28969,Free market will settle it all out.
28970,Hint: it’s in the interests of the free market for everyone to be vaccinated.
28971,"We have offered the vaccine to everyone, but not required it."
28972,"Vaccinated people can still catch the virus and test positive, but it's fairly rare."
28973,"Most of the people testing positive weren't vaccinated, because it wasn't required, and they are morons."
28974,Hey now [some people](https://external-content.duckduckgo.com/iu/?u=https%3A%2F%2Ftse1.mm.bing.net%2Fth%3Fid%3DOIP.i-HxAqDz-s_WSymdou3KSgHaEK%26pid%3DApi&amp;f=1) know how to stay (relatively) safe while still having a good time.
28975,"Maybe, or faster to the next variant—that could fuck us all"
28976,Anti-vaxxers are a collective millstone around the neck of humanity.
28977,"If they all randomly disappeared tomorrow, nothing of value would be lost."
28978,But I did it and didnt get paid.
28979,Thsts the issue
28980,"It’s a little late to be pushing for mass, full vaccination… the damage is pretty much done and we’ll likely need boosters or an entirely new vaccine by the rate that things are going."
28981,"More full vaccinations will help but once the “train” is rolling, it is much harder to stop."
28982,The critical question is are the hospitalized 7 vaccinated?
28983,In the winter my local health dept was telling us to wait 4-5 days after possible exposure to get tested.
28984,Has that changed?
28985,"The surge in cases you are referring to that's 'almost as bad as out first wave"" is driven by unvaccinated people."
28986,Breakthrough infections and hospitalizations among the vaccinated remain low compared to the overall vaccinated population.
28987,What numbers are you looking at that suggest massive outbreaks among fully vaccinated that rival the first wave in 2020?
28988,This is such a weird retort.
28989,"Out of 800 cases, only 7 of them required hospitalization."
28990,Keep that in mind.
28991,These vaccines are still extremely effective against serious disease.
28992,Is this one of those rhetorical questions I’ve heard so much about?
28993,I’m vaxxed and pissed off that the unvaxxed threaten my health.
28994,Yeah.
28995,I’d like that 3rd shot.
28996,Like right about now.
28997,Can you prove that the virus doesn’t mutate in vaccinated folks?
28998,He's trying his hardest to be a real di ck.
28999,Exactly *what* about demanding everyone be vaccinated is lunacy?
29000,"If you're medically unable to get the mRNA vaccine, J&amp;J has you covered."
29001,There is absolutely no excuse not to be vaccinated.
29002,"When the Spanish Flu was raging, people wore masks for 3 years."
29003,I'm fully vaccinated but I will continue to wear a mask until this is over.

29017,"This just goes to show you that with enough inbreeding and defunding of education, dreams can come true."
29018,"I generally think there is a huge risk to comparing covid to the flu, but for the purpose of this I think it is worth a comparison."
29019,Currently the death rate for covid in comparison to the flu is 3.5x greater.
29020,I think this is an important metric because seeing it closer to death rate of the flu would indicate significant medical advances to help reduce the risk of death.
29021,"If the death rate were similar and people were afraid to go out, that would likely be because of media influence (or trauma from the last year +) rather than based on true risk."
29022,Flu is a helpful comparison here because we know how the average person behaves during flu season.
29023,"Normal, healthy people continue about their daily lives, immune compromised people take extra precautions, and those with young children are especially careful."
29024,I think that is probably the most simple stat that we could look at to answer that question.
29025,"As someone who is high risk, I might even tolerate a slightly higher risk since there are some reasonable precautions that I could take during outbreaks to protect myself."
29026,"While I understand the rebuttal here, my point is that the ""average"" person likely does not have the means to reasonably protect themselves in outbreaks."
29027,"I'm privileged enough so that practically every single thing that I've purchased in over a year has been delivered to my house, groceries and all."
29028,Most people do not have that privilege.
29029,"So in areas of substantial transmission, there is a risk to basic ADLs such as going to the grocery store or convenience store, going to work, a doctor appt, eating dinner in public, etc."
29030,Most people aren't able to do all of these things through delivery and virtual options.
29031,"Even at the height of flu season, you generally wouldn't have a very high risk of catching the flu with any of these basic tasks, but obviously that's very different with covid."
29032,There are a lot of complexities that we could pick apart from here.
29033,Most aren't thinking about the long-term consequences that come with a significant portion of high-risk people (or those caring for someone high-risk) not re-entering the work force and the economical effect that their change in habits creates.
29034,This whole situation isn't as simple as just being tired of wearing a mask.

29057,We have massive shortages on parts right now.
29058,Major parts due to USA production shut downs.
29059,Many plants just don't have the shippers to ship items.
29060,And that's impacting us big time.
29061,The arguably most alarming data point is that vaccinated people are equally as contagious as unvaccinated people.
29062,That's not good.
29063,Hence the mask guidance.
29064,It drives me crazy that these people don't trust medicine when it comes to prevention (vaccines) but when their lives are in danger they'll rush to the hospital for help from the same medical establishment they deride regularly.
29065,An all-too-common mindset that it's not to be taken seriously until one is personally affected.
29066,Pathetically childlike thinking from adults who should know better.
29067,"World's smallest violin, dude"
29068,"Nature decides to finally shake itself free from the blight of humanity, does so not with fire and violence but instead sends tiny viral agent to simply make us apes once more."
29069,"Wait, is that why the GSE Apes meme came about?"
29070,"We know this is happening to us but we cannot yet confront it individually, only through collective conscious?"
29071,Oh god why can't I stop thinking?
29072,[removed]
29073,Yep.
29074,They suddenly think that the pandemic is over and it is no longer their responsibility to prevent community spreading anymore.
29075,Sucks to be a healthcare worker right now.
29076,This is a totally wrong way to look at vaccine efficacy.
29077,"A majority of breakthrough cases may have symptoms, but you need to compare the chance of getting infected at all in vaccinated and unvaccinated groups."
29078,&gt; vaccinated people have to behave like the shot is a placebo and that they’re completely vulnerable.
29079,No.
29080,"Vaccinated people are significantly protected from serious illness, but they can still spread the Delta variant."
29081,When there’s less virus circulartng in the community which will happen if we vax and mask enough.

29096,I just saw a link of fucker Carlson whining about masks again
29097,"Well, for once the anti-vaxxers have an advantage."
29098,So what you're saying is the antivax crowd already had covid?
29099,&gt; Why are we all of a sudden acting like this is March 2020 again and we don’t know anything about the virus?
29100,I swear some people actually enjoyed March 2020 and want to stay there.
29101,"Also teach, they are all about creating characters/avatars in their comics."
29102,It’s almost page after page of character designs… but they do not give their characters something to do or world build them a location to be in.
29103,It’s all about the character outward.
29104,They’re expressing themselves in a safe medium but they aren’t going further than just the expressing.
29105,Delta is a different beast.

29123,Came here to say pretty much this.
29124,"I recently heard the actual Plague circulated around London for decades, even when we think about it being over."
29125,"When deaths hit a certain number, the gathering places like theaters had to close."
29126,"The Globe Theatre closed for some seasons because of this, (And Shakespeare wrote some of his best work when he was essentially in lockdown and not able to perform any plays.)"
29127,So yes -- this really in a plague.
29128,It has been known for quite some time that the vaccines are safe for most conditions including epilepsy.
29129,We’ve been recommending it to our patients for many months now
29130,I am sorry if I left the impression that chickenpox is a mass killer.
29131,"It kills about 100/year before vax, 20/yr now."
29132,"Now, the health problem related to chickenpox is more substantial, eye, brain problem, and this thing can stay in the body for 50 years before active, e.g., Shingles."
29133,"Covid mortality rate is many orders higher than chickenpox, obviously (it killed 500k already last year), point in CDC document is about ease of transmission are comparable, not mortality rate."
29134,Also important in the article: “The new data suggest that vaccinated people are spreading the virus and contributing to those numbers — although probably to a far lesser degree than the unvaccinated.”
29135,That would have been closer to the truth if huge swaths of low-information individuals hadn't rejected the vaccine.
29136,Vaccines work really well when enough people take them.
29137,This is the coronavirus sub where people shame others for simply leaving their house after being vaccinated.
29138,"Pretty sure it’s covid, specifically the delta variant"
29139,Stop gaslighting people with a different opinion as you.
29140,Schools need to stay open and in person.
29141,Kids have lost out on a massive amount of education and socialization.
29142,Virtual school is not an option and is essentially a worthless frustration for parents of young kids.
29143,What is “safe” to you?
29144,Zero COVID?
29145,Not happening buddy.
29146,Try to remember how you lived your life in 2019 with personal risk calculations.
29147,I'm meeting with my child's principal on Monday.
29148,We are now planning to homeschooling until she's vaccinated (age 6).
29149,We had fully planned to send her in June.
29150,"Our county has one of the lowest vaccination rates in our state and all schools in the area are saying masks optional, no virtual, no close contact quarantine requirement."
29151,"So yeah, I feel tired."
29152,My favorite story from the last 18 months is the time I had a coughing fit from swallowing water the wrong way and someone who overheard me told me I needed to go home from work because I might have covid.
29153,"Our bodies cough for so, so, so many reasons, only one of which is covid."
29154,I live in Arkansas.
29155,I’m vaccinated but I have a daughter and it’s terrifying.
29156,Someone be a gem and provide the article?
29157,I've been trying to find a silver lining in this clusterfuck that's a pretty good one.
29158,No because they stupidly interpreted new data that shouldve comforted them.
29159,"The data to me shows that the vaccine is better than I even thought at first, and the unvaccinated are the only ones who need to worry."
29160,They got spooked because the want to protect anti vax idiots who won't even protect themselves.

29168,yea well maybe because also god is fake.
29169,Bad news: even if you get the vaccine for chicken pox you can still get shingles.
29170,It’s a rather unfortunate thing I found out a couple years ago.
29171,Like being vaccinated?
29172,For the record Gainesville is quite liberal and has very much been masked up since the beginning.
29173,"Correct, however may implies greater than 50%likelihood, wanna call it 75%?"
29174,All this means is that they're not testing.
29175,"They've closed down testing sites, and the people are about as interested in showing up for testing as they are about having their eyes gouged out."
29176,"So this time, just to shake things up a little - we've done this pandemic thing in reverse for 2021."
29177,As opposed to 2020 COVID.
29178,"This year, we decided to let everybody act as if there was no pandemic (because""tHe vAcCiNeS aRe OuT!!"
29179,"), and just go ahead and let out hospitals fill up to capacity.......and THEN we decide that there may be......

# ......issues."
29180,They wanna get paid by the insurance companies.
29181,It sucks here.
29182,"My family and I are all fully vaccinated, but the rest of our city probably isn't."
29183,At least that's what it feels like.
29184,Our state government doesn't really try at anything.
29185,"Back home, slowly recovering."
29186,It doesn't even really mention the severe disease part in the article other than a quick word.
29187,"&amp;#x200B;

What this really means is that anti-vaxxors can't hang their hat on their friends/family getting vacc'd."
29188,We won't protect them.
29189,Same here.
29190,At what point to human rights trump this sort of malignant policy?
29191,Hollywood taught me that Americans didn't negotiate with terrorists.
29192,People who chose not to get vaccinated should get in the back of the line.
29193,They can do their own research and intubate themselves.
29194,Ironic thing about the new mask advice from CDC is that vaccinated people are more likely to follow it and wear masks then unvaccinated people - but the whole point for vaccinated people to wear them is to protect the unvaccainted - who wont protect themselves with masks
29195,That's exactly the point I made in yesterday's daily thread.
29196,It's not the anti-vaxxers here that caused delta... it's the developing world which has large populations of high density unvaccinated people in unsanitary conditions.
29197,But there is hope here.
29198,Vaccinated people who do get breakthrough infections mostly present as asymptomatic or very mild cases (like a cold).
29199,I believe I heard somewhere that initial evidence is indicating those with immunity due to prior infection (rather than vaccine) are in a similar boat with delta.
29200,So... for those with either vaccine or infection acquired immunity these new strains are very mild and have low risk of hospitalization or death.
29201,"At the end of the day, I do not believe covid can be eradicated."
29202,"But once the whole population has been vaccinated or exposed, is that an issue?"
29203,"What matters is the rate of hospitalization and death... and if each subsequent exposure (or vaccine booster) reduces this likelihood, eventually each new variant of covid is just a different strain of a coronavirus based common cold (for all intents and purposes)."
29204,"As a Texan, I abhor this man."
29205,What a science-denying lowlife.
29206,"I mean, it isnt considered the dumbest state in America for nothing"
29207,"Yes, but you missed my point."
29208,more people vaccinated means less people die in the short term.
29209,However if people vaccinated or not are still moving about in society especially without a mask they are still spreading the virus and providing opportunities for it to mutate.
29210,Eventually through enough mutations it will acquire the ability to kill more effectively and evade the vaccine.
29211,Leading to more deaths in the long term.
29212,Leading to one conclusion regardless of vaccination status to prevent further mutations and worse disease people must practice social distancing and masking in public.
29213,I feel the same.
29214,I had a baby right before the pandemic.
29215,I did everything.
29216,"Curbside pickup or delivery, no going out, seeing friends, etc."
29217,While my husband had to work in person.
29218,"I had to not put my son in daycare, I had to work from home with a baby, I mentally am broken."
29219,I've had to see therapists.
29220,I have to go back to work in person to teach in Florida...in 2 weeks.
29221,I'm so fucked.
29222,Finally!
29223,My state is #1 in something!
29224,That must be it.
29225,But 8L/min oxygen is a lot of oxygen.
29226,People (except for the reddit and rogan crowd) place a much higher value on life than the 16th century where it was expected for 10-20% of a city to die from smallpox a few times every decade
29227,My vaccination card was literally on my bathroom counter when I got my third injection.
29228,Living up to its reputation
29229,There's no oof here.
29230,"That's Darwinism at work, doing God's good work."
29231,Maybe consider editing your last post to clarify.
29232,Good on you for reconsidering your stance though for sure!
29233,Yeah we're stuck in this crazy cycle where the anti-vaxxers will have someone or themselves in the family die or get seriously ill from covid-19.
29234,They will then change their tune and have this tearful plea for others to get vaccinated.
29235,And then the rest of the anti-vaxxers ignore them until it happens to someone in their family.
29236,"I think the difficulties are equally split between this, and also just being too dumb to understand how community spread works."
29237,"I just don't understand how it spreads, I don't care I understand it, I'm  never gonna understand it or try to."
29238,FREEEDOMMM!!
29239,!
29240,We need to be *extremely* cautious about lab data.
29241,Remember at the very beginning of the pandemic when some lab study claimed that live virus was detectable on surfaces for 3 days and people starting dousing their groceries in Lysol?
29242,"We need real-world data, because lab studies can show that something is theoretically possible but won't manifest in real life."
29243,"&gt;That said, the fact that the UK regulatory agency determined that vaccines are more of a risk to children than covid

They didn't say that exactly, they said there wasn't yet enough evidence to show that the risks from Covid outweighs the risk of vacvines, they want more data on vsccines ."
29244,"You are exactly right though, it's a relatively close thing."
29245,"But I can't help but side with the US and the doctors and experts who think vaccinating teens are the right choice, both based on the evidence I've seen, and based on all the other benefits teens could have from getting vaccinated, like not missing school, being able to visit granny without worrying about passing on covid etc."
29246,I don't like that the medical regulators only look at weighing up risk of death or serious injury which is extremely incredibly rare anyway.
29247,"If medical regulators were in charge of transport, theme parks, going to the beach etc...we would never leave the house."
29248,LeT tHe BuSiNesSes dEcIdE.
29249,Fuck the gop
29250,"That's how reality works though, we learn as we go, as new data comes up."
29251,It sounds like you are just overloaded with news so maybe a good idea to just pause for a while and treat covid as you treated it in 2020.
29252,"Masks, avoid very crowded indoor places and vaccinate."
29253,That will give you a good balance between enjoying life and protecting yourself.

29365,An actual shot mandate would run into union lawsuits.
29366,This is just a testing regime that can be opted out of via vaccination.
29367,Which is a much lower bar to clear legally.
29368,They are just counting on people tired of having their brain scraped every week.
29369,Which will happen in some cases but the hard core anti vax people are likely just to keep taking the test.
29370,"I think the best way is not to use scripture or what they preach against them, but rather offer them the perspective that the Bible is not to be taken as the word of a big sky man who will punish them."
29371,Using the Bible’s values as a reason to stop what they are doing only gives the Bible more power and it is better to not do so.
29372,"This will not make them change, just offer them a new perspective for growth."
29373,"After all, forcing people to follow a dogma leads to deep psychological problems."
29374,"Your last point is true, you can’t make them change what they believe their sky god wants, you can’t make them believe anything."
29375,The healthiest thing you can do is offer a new perspective if they want to hear it.
29376,They elected him fully knowing who he was and the kind of things he would do
29377,I thought conservatives believe in small governments being able to make educated decisions based on what is happening in their local area?
29378,Isn’t that against their beliefs?
29379,Big government stepping in and telling the little guys how to run their counties/cities?
29380,Who are you talking about?
29381,"Fresh off the presses, Texas governor is a dick"
29382,Hit the gym.
29383,"Honestly, it depending on how the data is looking over the next few weeks, but I’m leaning towards just going for it."
29384,"I *think* (and this is based on anecdotal data from friends and coworkers) that there shouldn’t be any flu-ish symptoms if you go for a third, simply because I know people who have had covid and then got vaccinated, and they had the reaction on their **first** dose, and basically nothing on the second."
29385,"I’m not a doctor/immunologist, but it sounds like the immune system is “primed” by the first exposure (either the pathogen or the vaccine), and the second exposure triggers an aggressive immune response; after that, the immune system is “tuned” to it enough that it doesn’t affect normal bodily processes too noticeably."
29386,[This guy](https://reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/ouapwm/_/h72wtdt/?context=1) explained how he got the third shot when I inquired.
29387,I agree to a point.
29388,It is also affecting children too young to be vaccinated.
29389,Texas Children’s has patients on ventilators.
29390,"It is also affecting adults who truly cannot receive the vax, like those who are immunocompromised."
29391,Edit:  Misread your comment.
29392,Completely agree with you.
29393,I hear you.
29394,"But delta is ripping through our communities so hard, and given that most places are either not mandating masks or enforcing them half-heartedly, isn't it pretty much guaranteed that most of us are going to catch Delta?"
29395,So the key stats is really how many hospitalized people are vaccinated?
29396,"The message should switch from ""vaccine will shield you from covid"" to ""vaccine will prevent you from hospitalization from covid"" (which admittedly they are already doing this message switch)."
29397,"They're not sucking Trump's dick, they're sucking Trump's followers dicks."
29398,They're simping for psycho votes.
29399,Republicans complain about big govt reaching down into lower govt levels and controlling lives
29400,"If we had stopped all non-essential international travel (and required strict 2-week quarantines for all essential travel) as soon as we knew this was going to become a pandemic, it wouldn't have become a pandemic."
29401,"If the world implemented this strategy at any point since it became a pandemic, we would have stopped the spread of new regional variants across the globe, and made it less likely for those variants to appear in the first place (as fewer regions would be infected)."
29402,This seems completely obvious.
29403,"Medieval Italians figured this out - don't let infected people in, and your people can't get infected."
29404,State capacity to control borders has increased massively since the 1300s.
29405,So am I missing something?
29406,Are people just stupid?
29407,Corrupt?
29408,Are they too afraid of sounding like a certain shitty US president?
29409,"There should *at least* be a plan to implement this strategy in the case of a new, potentially deadlier pandemic, but I see talk of it nowhere."
29410,What if it we can't develop a vaccine?
29411,What if the death rate is like the untreated bubonic plague?
29412,It’s effective for *at least* six months.
29413,That’s the last testing interval done on trial subjects.
29414,Expect to hear longer duration soon.
29415,The mental health of kids is already at a breaking point.
29416,I don’t mean to be rude but you need to be quiet when spouting off on stuff you don’t know
29417,85% is for symptomatic infection.

29421,thank you!
29422,"&amp;#x200B;

29423,It comes with a whole set of other problems.
29424,"Don’t forget, the more people pay into the system the more they feel entitled to have a say over how you live your life."
29425,"It works well for coronavirus, but not so well for other social issues"
29426,When it comes to politicians like this the cheap housing in Texas doesn’t seem to be worth it.
29427,I’m proud to be a Texan always but this makes me even prouder.
29428,Wow.
29429,They outdid Florida.
29430,Quite a feat
29431,I'd prefer not sacrificing my kids health to get there.
29432,Once vaccines are eligible to everyone then I'm fine with letting it play itself out.
29433,Long term pain is coming if we keep remotely teaching kids (especially young ones)
29434,That’s fair I hear that.
29435,If you’re concerned then yeah safest bet is playing it safe till vaccines are available.
29436,Hopefully it’s soon
29437,"I have no idea, but it's irrelevant."
29438,Nothing what you said addresses that there can emerge new dangerous variants.
29439,But you surely know it better than the WHO.
29440,Arizona checking in.
29441,"School started 9 days ago, we will see the results of this in another week or so."
29442,"It sickens me that politicians don’t care about the health and safety of children, let alone adults."
29443,The willingly unvaxxed don’t care.
29444,They think everyone is brainwashed while the reality is they are the ones that got brainwashed.
29445,"Honestly, pull federal funding from this asshat."
29446,"I'm sick of these states relying on my tax dollars when they come begging after their idiotic ""no big gubment"" obstructionism inevitably fucks them."
29447,Why the hell would anyone downvote this?
29448,"I'm a huge fan of personal space, always have been."
29449,During this pandemic Ive been forced to practically run away from people because they won't stop getting in my face.
29450,"Jaysus people, back off, seriously."
29451,"Maybe so,  but it might be school and community specific."
29452,My daughter and most of her friends are wearing masks.
29453,"I noticed when they got together, one of the girls not wearing a mask went and got hers from her mom and put it on."
29454,Kids can be a lot more respectful and thoughtful than we give them credit for.
29455,"Yes, the data is so complex that unfortunately the anti-vaxx crowd is using it for their benefit."
29456,"And it's working, as most people don't take the time to understand nuance."
29457,"Data from Israel, which was ahead of the world with vaccination and used only Pfizer, shows exactly what you're saying - immunity for getting covid is waning, but the protection against serious disease and death is still high."
29458,But it also shows we'll need a booster for sure.
29459,I was looking for sources to keep up to date with all this mess and I found John Campbell's YouTube channel.
29460,He's a retired medical professional living in the UK and goes over the latest data and research from all over the world.
29461,He mostly does a pretty good job putting it all together and into perspective.
29462,"&gt; The data to me shows that the vaccine is better than I even thought at first

Can you tell me what part of that was very encouraging for you?"
29463,I'd love some good news today thanks.
29464,"175,000 people died??"
29465,"(Honest question, am European)"
29466,"Ofc we’ll be living with Covid for the rest of our lives just like 99% of other diseases that exist, the normalcy I’m talking about is one where there are no restrictions - No masks, no social distancing, no testing unless for sparse localized outbreaks and that is possible once we vaccinate enough people."
29467,"You know who “they” are, they are the Unvaccinated whom straight up refuse to get vaccinated I’ll exempt from this group those who actually can’t take a vaccine for medical reasons or aren’t eligible yet or potentially have been completely been unable to be vaccinated (which has happened in some areas), which is why we actually need high vaccination rates to achieve herd immunity to protect these people from idiots who can’t do some basic responsibility of getting vaccinated to protect their own communities, much less themselves."
29468,Texas is the biggest turd in the country.
29469,"So, the dumb ones?"
29470,Got it!
29471,"They weren't vaccinated at all a year ago, but they weren't ending up in the hospital."
29472,"If you recall, the prevalent wisdom was that young, healthy people would end up with a bad cold."
29473,That's clearly no longer the case.
29474,This is one of the only ways I can make sense of the UK trends.
29475,"This sub has been complaining about mask mandates, safety measures (granted, some of it was warranted and just for show w/ little use) more so than being for it since like January of this year dude."
29476,This sub took a very distinct shift in tone since this winter.
29477,"It is only recently, due to anti-vax idiots causing the recent surges, that the complainers have had to bite their tongue now that they can't be like ""SO tHeN tRuSt ThE SCIencE"" like y'all were a few months ago lol."
29478,"&gt; probably somewhere around 65%

Where did you get this number from?"
29479,It is prob around 85% for that
29480,Thank you for breaking that down for me.
29481,I appreciate it!
29482,"Yes, the article said 97% were unvaccinated with the average age of 55years old being admitted to the hospitals."
29483,"Even in Alabama, most people over age 65 have been vaccinated."
29484,Teachers.
29485,A group they care even less about.
29486,Are you allowed to refuse service?
29487,This man is dead set on spreading COVID as much as possible.
29488,Probably try to convert some other wards but reality is triage will happen.
29489,Get into a bad car wreck…well too bad.
29490,Symptomatic can mean a lot of things.
29491,"Stuffy nose, scratchy throat, tired, etc."
29492,"I agree with your point, but keep that in mind."
29493,Conservatives are just determined to kill off their own voters.
29494,It’s unreal.
29495,I'd argue it more or less comes down to when holidays and events are.
29496,Holidays = more households mixing than on an average day or week in most countries.
29497,Families and friends get together.
29498,"In that case, please accept my humble apologies and my congratulations for being an awesome person."
29499,I hope those kids have happy lives and get all the love and opportunities every child should get.

29533,"I guess in the beginning if just 10% of the hospitalized are vaccinated then I would consider that an ""alarming"" amount since we expected the vaccinated to not get hospitalized at all."

29546,Imagine what happens when the next pandemic moves through.

29549,"They need to have a mask mandate for everyone who comes in the building, no matter who they are"

29554,"When you choose a leader based on how much rights they will take away from others who are different from you and then expect that same leader to turn around and care about you, you end up looking stupid or dead."

29559,"As Texas becomes more and more purple, and the side that votes down the red party line keeps listening to the ones spouting the hypocritical nonsense and cheering for things like this.."
29560,Sad reality will begin to set in that those whom lose their lives to something they could be vaccinated against also (seemingly) make up that voting population that would vote to keep him.
29561,Harris/Dallas/Travis counties being those that have a 50%+ rate versus all of the larger populated counties sometimes being &gt;40%?
29562,This is going to be prime political science and statistical data crunching material for years to come.
29563,"No you got me wrong, it was an honest question."
29564,Can the federal government issue an executive order to overrule?
29565,Source is purely anecdotal.
29566,"I've seen it mentioned in several articles, virtually always in a quote from an ICU doctor."
29567,"You're welcome to find ways to disbelieve or dismiss it, of course."
29568,I think many people would be more comfortable continuing to think of Covid as something that won't affect them because of their youth or lack of pre-existing conditions.
29569,There's a talk-radio guy in Nashville who cited both of those factors as reasons that he wasn't worried about Covid and wouldn't be getting vaxxed.
29570,Yesterday they put him on a ventilator.
29571,"Question: If there turn out to be long term negative effects from the vaccine that you insisted be given to people against their will, would you personally admit you were wrong?"
29572,Or would you stand by your actions and say it was still a risk worth taking for the greater good?
29573,Just trying to pin down your mindset.
29574,"We need a vaccine mandate, not just a mask mandate."
29575,genius
29576,Are you not sure why the vaccine is the focus?
29577,“We” can mitigate it?

29581,So a big herd immunity experiment is underway.
29582,"Also, see here:
https://www.dph.illinois.gov/covid19/vaccinedata?county=Illinois

644 people who were fully vaccinated have been hospitalized due to covid, at all, ever, in the state of Illinois."
29583,"To my knowledge, total hospitalizations have not been tracked."
29584,There have been 6 million Illinoisans fully vaccinated.
29585,The vaccination rate of Massachusetts means little here.
29586,What matters is the vaccination rate among the group exposed at Provincetown.
29587,"The exact number is unknown (and unknowable - you can't check who was exposed but not infected), but is likely to have been very high, well above 70%."
29588,"If it were only 70%, then a 75% vaccination rate among the infected would mean that vaccines make you *more* likely to be infected!"
29589,"Put another way, imagine we have 10,000 people in Provincetown."
29590,95% are vaccinated.
29591,"1000 people catch covid, 75% of whom are vaccinated."
29592,Is this good or bad news for vaccines?
29593,"Well, among the 500 unvaccinated people, 250 caught covid, or 50%."
29594,"But among the 9,500 vaccinated, 750 caught covid, or only about 8%!"
29595,A pretty good result!

29689,Then why did the CDC advised that the vaccinated not need to wear masks?
29690,This is the party of there is no climate change antivax etc.
29691,🤪🤪🤪
29692,346 were vaccinated so that's like 1% of people were hospitalized
29693,"You’re correct, there are in fact two hive minds dueling for control."
29694,"Nah, we'll never stand for that, not even most of us who were diligent about precautions through the first year of this."
29695,It's something we're gonna have to live with.
29696,"Our vaccines dramatically reduce the likelihood of severe disease/hospitalization/death, making this still a threat but no longer orders of magnitude more dangerous than the threats we already face day to day."
29697,I can't wait for a booster specifically designed to go after the Delta.
29698,Funny you make that point.
29699,Open carry is legal Sept 1 in Texas.

29704,My anecdotal info backs this up.
29705,There's another group worried about missing work or inability to care for kids due to side effects.
29706,Those are two groups you'd see 100% uptake on if you locked them up.
29707,I think both smokers and unvaxxed people would be out at high rates.
29708,I think it's time we as a society stop viewing every death from a highly contagious respiratory disease as entirely preventable.
29709,"To do so ignores human nature, and that's not evidence-based decision making."

29729,Since it was a contact-traced outbreak it’s fairly  unlikely most people wouldn’t get tested just because they weren’t immediately presenting symptoms.
29730,"Furthermore, even if that is the case, it’s even worse news on the degree to which asymptomatic spread and infection occurs in vaccinated people."

29742,"Just a small correction - according to the latest official numbers I was able to find, it's not primarily killing the unvaccinated."
29743,"The Delta variant is killing a nearly identical number of vaccinated and unvaccinated (latest reported had more vaccinated deaths, by 2 - but this is insignificant."
29744,It mostly just shows that there are some people who are pre-disposed and incredibly susceptible no matter what) in developed countries.
29745,"HOWEVER, that doesn't diminish the point - because hospitalizations are through the roof with unvaccinated individuals."

And on the other they say:

29796,"It's terrible for the families of those 1,411 people, especially because they did the right thing and got vaccinated."
29797,But sometimes your number is called.
29798,Yes but the difference is that 90% of UK's over 50's have had at least one shot.
29799,We have huge populations of vulnerable people who've had none.
29800,The real answer is we don't know.

29804,I’ll let those families know this great piece of information as well.
29805,My lunch break is over….gotta go give these people this amazing knowledge
29806,The good news is that it's not.
29807,"Even though the current vaccines have shown to have decreased efficacy against Delta, the actual protection is still staggeringly high, better than every flu shot ever developed, and still among the best vaccines ever."
29808,"The more people who get the jab, the more protected the entire world population becomes."
29809,I'm just saying don't experiment with drugs.
29810,It's sketchy as hell.
29811,There haven't been any proper studies done.
29812,It's not that urgent that it have to be done right now.
29813,"Even if the best thing is to get a third shot, there should always be a wait period between vaccines."
29814,"Like some think that the reason delta is spreading faster in Israel is because they had relatively short periods between vaccinations, compared to the UK which had a lot longer."
29815,"There was one study which found that the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine is 81% effective when its second dose is given three months after the first, and only 55% efficacy after six weeks."
29816,"If you look at like the TBE vaccine the second dose should be taken 1-3 months after the first, and the third dose should be 5-12 months after the second, after that you can take booster doses every 3 years."
29817,"When it would be time to get a third dose, they'll probably know if people should or not."

29826,Is he gonna prevent schools from requiring the meningitis or tetanus vaccine next?
29827,Who is dumb enough that they see this shit and think “he’s doing the Lord’s work here”?
29828,I’ll give you a hint - it’s the same ones that don’t get educated well enough because he and Republican Party have been dismantling our school system for years.
29829,Keep the populace dumb and they don’t know better.
29830,Not to mention republican governor in Alabama crying and saying this pandemic is now because of nonvax folks is pretty damning.. wish Desantis can learn from her

29840,They have essentially stayed inside our home for the last 16 months and I have been the main one to go out when necessary.
29841,"So far, all 4 of us have managed to not become infected."
29842,"Now this option has been taken away as our district is not offering virtual this year, and we can’t afford to stay on one income much longer."
29843,"Our daughter is 8 and our son, who has severe autism and is non-verbal, is 4."
29844,They both start school on August 11…without any mask mandate in place.
29845,"We are fairly confident that our daughter will keep her mask on throughout the school day, but we have never been able to get our son to wear a mask."
29846,"Hey Governor Abbott, can you please give me some advice on how we should explain “personal responsibility” to our son so that he will wear a mask while in school around dozens of other unmasked, unvaccinated students and adults?"
29847,"We are so desperate that we just signed both kids up for the pediatric vaccine trials, but so far neither of them have been selected."

29877,"Unfortunately not our first rodeo with it, my Uncle passed back December from COVID."
29878,The thing that seems to be missing here is how many people were contacted and how many responded.
29879,"Let's say they contacted 10,000 vaccinated people and 500 unvaccinated people, and then only 300 unvaccinated people responded but 9,000 vaccinated people did."
29880,Finding those case numbers isn't terribly concerning then.
29881,"Those are obviously made up numbers, and I have zero idea what the real ones are, but the fact that that appears to be missing makes this almost meaningless."

29883,People are biased.
29884,There are a lot of people on here that want to hear that vaccines work and we are all free.

29895,Do people really think it's going to stop much of anything?
29896,It might help stop a cough or sneeze from getting droplets everywhere but there are way too many gaps for it to stop something airborne.
29897,I was a mental wreck through it all.
29898,Worst 4 years of my life in terms of politics.
29899,I know other presidents did plenty of bad stuff but they were not keeping themselves in the spotlight in a negative way every damn day.
29900,"Also, I'm not keen on seeing how flawed our government structure is in preventing a dictatorship or coup and it was often feeling like we were on the verge of that."
29901,It's awful our government is like that so we need to do our best to try to prevent such authoritarian type people from the top seats of power because it's not easy at all to fix those flaws.

29903,No deaths?

29912,Sure.
29913,"It was possible to be an unaware spreader before, if you had an asymptomatic infection, but mask mandates and social distancing decreased the chance of spreading the virus unknowingly."
29914,"Now, with the Delta variant, we see a lot of breakthrough infections, which mostly cause asymptomatic or very minor infections in fully vaccinated people."
29915,Vaccinated people tend to feel less at risk but also less of a risk to others and participate in public life and events without masks and social distancing.

30131,My brother had underlying issues regardless the vaccine was not available when they died.
30132,I got vaccinated the first day I could.
30133,I lived through how shitty COVID can be on a person that most people don’t see.
30134,My sister was right there with me.
30135,She still believes the vaccine is a conspiracy.
30136,Well guess what… she and her whole family picked up COVID pretty bad about a month ago.
30137,I bet it was the delta variant.
30138,Regardless she had a rough go of it.
30139,I asked her If she wished she had gotten the vaccine and she said no way.
30140,It is now my opinion that you can see two family members die see silence facts and yet still believe some cracked out bullshit from the Internet then you as a human are a piece of shit.

30328,USING GOVERNMENT AUTHORITY TO LIMIT WHAT LOWER GOVERNMENTS CAN DO IS NOT LIMITING GOVERNMENT.
30329,IT IS JUST MAKING SURE *HIS* OFFICE IS IN CHARGE WHICH IS IN FACT EMBOLDENING GOVERNMENT.
30330,&gt;Remember when Republicans would tell us that big government should stay out of local politics because local governments know what's best for their local communities?
30331,"""so i think schools should mandate something which people normally should be allowed to decide themself""

30376,"&gt; The people most likely to die from covid are already vaccinated

There is a regional aspect to this, so using a national statistic and applying it to a regional situation allows for a large margin of error The areas where this surge is occurring, states like Alabama, Mississippi, Arkansas and Louisiana also have a 10 point drop from that average in first dose vaccination rates among those 65+."
30377,"There is also increased risk to the younger cohorts if they have comorbidities, predominantly hypertension, diabetes and chronic renal disease."

30397,His refusal to tell the states to go shove it with regards to their pro-COVID policies has been the biggest disappointment of his presidency so far.
30398,Not quite.
30399,Here is what I mean.
30400,Say 75 people are vacvinated and 25 unvaccinated in 100 people.
30401,"Say 20 test positive, 15 from the vaccinated and 5 from the unvaccinated."
30402,"But if 1 of the 15 vaccinated gets hospitalized/dies vs 3 of 5 from the unvaccinated group, that will show the vaccines work."
30403,That is the data we need.

30405,"""The governor added that vaccines remain the most effective defense against the virus but would never be forced in the state."""
30406,"So in the same breath as ""No mask mandates and  no vaccine mandates"", he said this."
30407,This is not medical advice.
30408,There need to be one person elected by the family to do communication with the hospital.

30442,These wonderful life saving people we depend on are so FUCKING BROKEN by our own stupidity that many of them are beginning to feel like people admitted without a vaccine should be denied care.
30443,"Here is a quote from by BFF:

&gt; I’m tired of putting myself and my family at risk every single fucking day by going to work."
30444,It was a risk that had to be taken before there were vaccines; now on the front lines going into another wave it’s all due to the unvaccinated.

30453,"When politics is so deeply entrenched into everything that a life-saving, family-saving, neighbor-saving vaccine is a political issue, I completely agree with my friend, we are no longer a functioning society and I do not know if there is a way back...

We've called them heroes over and over again, and we have a solution to ease their suffering AND OUR OWN and we won't fucking take it because of how idiotic our country is."
30454,"Other countries would kill for the access to vaccines we have, really ethically at this point we should be giving them to people who will use them in other countries."
30455,"I never thought I would say something like this, but maybe the only way back to sanity is if Delta or another variant runs roughshod through sections of the country and Darwinism thins the herd."
30456,But that makes our healthcare workers and a lot of innocent people who can't take the vaccine for legitimate reasons into collateral damage.

30498,In some cases it's their lungs.
30499,In others it causes neurological problems.

30516,My own child went missing in first grade and no one noticed he was walking around town.
30517,Then his classroom was flooded and they sent the kids back in.

30643,This doesn't support their premise because the shot can save your life whether it protects you from being contagious or not.
30644,In conjunction with universal masking it can get and keep the contagion level down until everyone is vaccinated.
30645,That is a desirable thing worth the jab on a social level.
30646,But they're not going to hear that.
30647,They don't listen to the station that plays that song.

But there's literally been emergency powers granted and recinded in this pandemic."

30656,Serious question: what in the ever-loving hell are they trying to accomplish?
30657,Doubling-down on a bad decision?
30658,Trying to kill people off?
30659,*Banning* the creation of measures to protect people just seems like saying the quiet part out loud.
30660,tbf non of the vaccines are approved.
30661,technically.
30662,The Unreasonable are the deeper pandemic.
30663,Limited federal government and leave it up to the state.
30664,They wish to stay out of your life as much as possible that includes not forcing you to wear a mask.
30665,This is the definition of limited government.

30667,I really hate this.
30668,Why is the governor of Texas so determined to have a culture war.

30679,40% less likely compared to what?
30680,You aren't making sense.
30681,Someone should make a daily chart with the number of deaths in Texas since Abbot became governor
30682,I think one of the more annoying parts nowadays is the virtue signalling on posts about the forced masks coming back.
30683,"""Well ***I*** never stopped wearing mine when I'm out and about amongst the *plague rats* because EW the unwashed masses."""
30684,Like great congrats.
30685,IDK what your point was other than to sound insufferable.
30686,The main difference in your analogy is that cancer isn't transmissible and COVID is.
30687,"Your hypothetical decision to refuse cancer treatment only affects your body, while one's decision to not vaccinate affects everyone that that person comes into close contact with."
30688,"The problem here is that conservatives constantly harp on ""big government"" overstepping their bounds, and this is a textbook example of that."
30689,It should be a private company or a school system's right to act in what they believe is the best interest of their employees or students and require vaccination if they see fit.
30690,You'll have to drown out the anti-vax propaganda.
30691,"You can't just say this once, people need to be bombarded with the message."
30692,Yes.
30693,"This way the covid rates in blue areas look the same as covid rates in red areas, then he can downplay the effects of mask mandates and vaccinations."
30694,"Otherwise you end up with red parts of Texas that’s overwhelmed with covid and blue spots that are doing well, and that would kill the gop narrative."
30695,That’s not the flu.
30696,That’s the norovirus.
30697,Completely different things.
30698,I feel we shouldn’t even be calling it he stomach flu.

30702,"Think this is crucial as well

""Among the vaccinated group, one had received the Pfizer vaccine, and the remaining three had received Johnson &amp; Johnson."

30706,"I live near a big city and we don’t have the astronomical numbers, even with tourism, because precautions are taking place and more people are getting vaccinated."
30707,I’m sorry your state sucks but I don’t feel bad visiting friends.
30708,You can get butthurt all you want online but nothing is going to change that fact that your governor and Trump loving state are a HUGE part of the problem.
30709,"If you’re so worried about tourists, why don’t you lobby your politicians to shut the state’s borders?"
30710,Or is it easier to come at me on this thread?

Thats a winner."
30712,My only regret is I dont have any awards to give.
30713,At this point he and most other republicans seemingly want people to die.
30714,You aren’t gaining any freedom by not having to wear masks inside just as don’t don’t lose any freedom when you are forced to wear pants outside.
30715,When will this get to the “Fuck it” point throughout the world?
30716,This shits been around too long and just seems like a phenomena that we can’t control.
30717,"Most people are fed up with this and the light at the end of the tunnel feels gone with this new variant, it’s literally like another virus."
30718,I’m ready to just not give a shit anymore even though I don’t want to.
30719,It’s never too late.
30720,I hate the “too little too late rhetoric” we should ALL be encouraging others to get vaccinated.
30721,"Again, I'm not arguing anything."
30722,I am simply telling you what the data actually says and you seem oddly incapable of understanding it.
30723,"And even though I feel like I've explained it pretty clearly several times already, I'll try one more time:

*You* have repeatedly interpreted what's been said here as ""only 123 vaccinated people were hospitalized in LA county this week""."
30724,That is not true.
30725,"What the data says is that ""123 vaccinated people were hospitalized **AND** tested positive for COVID this week""."
30726,My best friend is an MD who works in a veterans hospital with spinal cord injury patients.
30727,"A lot of these people have permanent and serious health issues, and some of them cannot be vaccinated."
30728,"I taught pharmacists while I was in grad school, I work with medical researchers, and have a ton of friends in the fields."
30729,People have lost their patients and in a lot of cases their faith in our country and its people.
30730,"He is one of the best people I've ever met and that you will find on this planet, and we are lucky AF we have people like him to be able to do jobs like that every day and deal with the mental strain that would crush many of us."
30731,"That being said, he has fucking had it."
30732,"He, quite a few of his colleagues, and myself are getting to or at the point, where they have seen so many people die without a chance to get a vaccine (then and now), that they have been completely drained of empathy for people who have the chance and ability to get the vaccine and choose not too."
30733,These wonderful life saving people we depend on are so FUCKING BROKEN by our own stupidity that many of them are beginning to feel like people admitted without a vaccine should be denied care.
30734,"Here is a quote from by BFF:

&gt; I’m tired of putting myself and my family at risk every single fucking day by going to work."
30735,It was a risk that had to be taken before there were vaccines; now on the front lines going into another wave it’s all due to the unvaccinated.
30736,"&gt; 
&gt; That’s not acceptable in a functional society."
30737,"If you don’t want the vax, fine, it’s your choice, but you’ve forfeited the opportunity for inpatient care."
30738,Best of luck to you.
30739,This is where we are in America right now and it honestly embarrasses me as both a citizen of this country and scientist who works on therapeutic development.
30740,It is disgusting.
30741,"When politics is so deeply entrenched into everything that a life-saving, family-saving, neighbor-saving vaccine is a political issue, I completely agree with my friend, we are no longer a functioning society and I do not know if there is a way back...

We've called them 'heroes' over and over again, and we have a solution to ease their suffering AND OUR OWN and we won't take it because of how idiotic our country is."
30742,"Other countries would kill for the access to vaccines we have, really ethically at this point we should be giving them to people who will use them in other countries..."
30743,"Maybe he could try and then maybe the supreme court would reverse it, so the court would ban banning banning mask mandates, and then maybe the public could retaliate via ballot initiative and vote in a constitutional amendment that reverses the courts decision and effectively bans banning banning banning mask mandates"
30744,"Yeah, it all has to transmission from vaccinated people."
30745,"But I’ve already expected for months that vaccinated people can transmit, so this really changes nothing for me."
30746,"The important thing is protection against severe disease, and that is holding up quite well."
30747,Fuck.
30748,They're so dumb and they're fucking us all over.
30749,According to who?
30750,I don't care if it's 10% for old people.
30751,And it doesn't concern me because my odds are so ridiculously fucking low.
30752,I am in my 20s and in perfect health and vaccinated.
30753,I take on more risk driving on the beltway than I do from living my life as normal rn.
30754,Only for as long as you stay locked down.
30755,If Rt&gt;1 now then Rt&gt;1 when you come out of lockdown.
30756,We gonna stay locked down for months again?
30757,I was extremely cautious and supportive of restrictions through the first year of this and I'm no longer willing to endure that when I no longer expect substantial benefit from it.
30758,And you can't enforce something that the majority oppose.
30759,Dumb
30760,"Here’s my new politics for the 21st century:

We don’t need states."
30761,republicans are evil.
30762,"This state is already a dumpster fire as far a a public health is concerned, and it's about to reach train-collision levels of bad."
30763,"Last year they had plexiglass, mask for everyone, daily temperature checks and health checks, separation in the class rooms at least 6 feet, kids sent home if there were any signs of sickness and a negative test to come back or 2 weeks time, online option..."
30764,Etc.
30765,"This year, you can wear a mask if you feel like it."
30766,Someone should prohibit his use of his chair anywhere.
30767,I feel like the result of this much like Trump may be the downfall of Abbot here and DeSantis in Florida come next election.
30768,Masks can be required but requiring vaccines is insane
30769,"I wasn't endorsing the downvotes, merely explaining."
30770,So of the multiple people I know in Bama that have just came down with covid this week.
30771,"The only 1 that was vaccinated, is the only one having complications with covid."
30772,"Everyone else is claiming to be fine, other than feeling like they're dealing with a sinus infection."
30773,Biden made a comment that “all these beds will be filled with Alzheimer’s patients in 10 years” or something similar about a month ago.

30869,"&gt;Preventing deaths and hospitalization, right[?]"
30870,"""Hospitalization"" is a vague term and can mean anything from a night with some supplemental oxygen to a double lung transplant."
30871,"Getting the vaccine helps ensure that if you do wind up in the hospital with COVID, the stay will be brief and relatively uneventful (and death-free, in case that needs spelling out): 

&gt;Dr. Brytney Cobia said Monday that all but one of her COVID patients in Alabama did not receive the vaccine."

30877,They showed that 9.8% of children aged 2–11 years and 13% aged 12–16 years reported at least one lingering symptom five weeks after a positive diagnosis.
30878,"Oh no, I think you’re a little stupid because you weren’t able to understand the difference between being hypocritical and opposing “Big Government” while fining private businesses simultaneously and a progressive who has no problem with “Big Government” and is fine with mask mandates."
30879,It was a crazy false equivalence
30880,"As mentioned in another thread this outbreak occurred during ""Bear Week""."
30881,For me the waiting game has run its course.
30882,"17 months of masks and closed businesses and virtual schools and very limited travel, personally its enough."
30883,"Let those who refuse the vaccine take the risk (including overwhelmed hospitals), limit their access to crowded places (sports, concerts, exhibitions, museums), and let the vaccine developers continue to improve and adjust."
30884,"Other than that, let us live our lives."
30885,It honestly makes me sick to my stomach.

30966,"&gt; If we had stopped all non-essential international travel (and required strict 2-week quarantines for all essential travel) as soon as we knew this was going to become a pandemic, it wouldn't have become a pandemic."
30967,This is ridiculously untrue.
30968,"Essential travel is still people traveling, some of who will be infected and contagious."
30969,Quarantines are not perfect containment systems.
30970,"All it takes is one person to introduce it to a region and then community spread starts, and the role of international travel becomes marginal."
30971,Look at all the effort countries like New Zealand and Australia and Thailand put into preventing travel and they still continue to have outbreaks that require periodic domestic lock downs.
30972,"There'd be no endpoint in sight if every country on the planet tried to completely isolate themselves, because the virus would still be out there and as soon as you end restrictions it would start to spread further."
30973,"Nothing to do with lobbyists, billionaires, media, donors."
30974,Everything to do with polling voters.
30975,Let this be a lesson.
30976,That's what politicians care about most.
30977,No donor is going to donate to a candidate they think can't win.
30978,No lobbyist tries to curry favor with people who aren't politicians and can't win office.
30979,You need power first.
30980,How do you get power?
30981,You get elected.
30982,How do you get elected?
30983,The people vote for you.
30984,"Politicians answer to us, even if people hate admitting that because it means we are part of the problem."
30985,I’m fully vaccinated and healthy.
30986,I know I’ll be fine.
30987,It’s more of an existential dread/worrying about the state of humanity in a pandemic thing.
30988,Except cancer isn't a contagious virus that mutates as it jumps from person to person.
30989,"If only having your head up your ass counted as masking up, huh?"
30990,Then we'd have no problem.
30991,So glad that Lancaster country set the precedent in Nebraska that they can issue it even if the state prohibits it due to the county health department predating the state department.
30992,"Not sure how Omaha got away with their mandates, but then the rest of the state copies them, and Dime Store Lex Luthor gets bored and doesn't bother with it again."
30993,Safe in that you won't get a case?
30994,"It's certainly lower odds, but there's a still a moderate chance you get Covid."
30995,Safe in that you won't have much of a problem with Covid even if you do get it?
30996,Yep.
30997,"Your vax will weaken the virus and your chance of dying is negligibly small, especially if you're school aged and somewhat healthy."
30998,People need to start accepting that catching Covid isn't that bad an outcome anymore.
30999,Good.
31000,Less Texans.

31008,"Yeah, some dolts did that to themselves willingly."

31017,I'm not.
31018,Our school doesn't have funding but will try to keep remote as an option.
31019,"I've signed them up for a remote school elsewhere just in case, and I guess I'm homeschooling my youngest because there isn't a public remote option available for them if their school district can't find funding."
31020,"Glad I quit my job and my partner can manage to work safe and support the family, otherwise we'd be in the same spot as the rest of our neighbors and also be contributing to the spread.."
31021,I feel for the few folks around me that actually care about their neighbors but can't work from home or don't have the ability to remote school.

31030,"If I had said how I felt about this issue, I would be harvesting my upvotes."
31031,"But those are just fake internet points, and where's the fun in just being an echo in an echo chamber?"
31032,&gt; They said people need to wear masks and take other steps to prevent spread until almost everyone in a population has been vaccinated.
31033,"If you read as far as the **2nd sentence** of the article, you will see that they are saying that vaccination will stop it *once the vaccination rate is high enough*, but until then, extra precautions are required because all of the people who are not vaccinated are spoiling things for everyone else."
31034,"&gt; From an evolutionary perspective, what is necessary to reduce this (spread) is to vaccinate as many people as possible as fast as possible and across the globe."
31035,"According to worldometers, since 27th, when it was still round 23 000 cases, it has gone up to 27 000 cases on 28th and to 30 000 on 29th."
31036,"The problem with this is that all this might be noise, it might be random chance, it might be explained by about million other things and we're simply way too close to the fall of the cases to say anything about the situation."
31037,"To know whether they go back up, keep falling or what is going to happen we have to wait for something like two or three weeks."
31038,At that point we can have some idea on why the cases are seemingly having sudden fall.
31039,"As for now, it is way too early to even speculate."
31040,"&gt;His dragging his feet on making the vaccine accessible in lower income areas

That's not a DeSantis-specific issue though."
31041,It's a national issue.
31042,We're even dealing with it here in California.
31043,"https://calmatters.org/health/coronavirus/2021/07/medi-cal-covid-vaccinations/

&gt;Low-income Californians enrolled in Medi-Cal have been vaccinated at far lower rates than the overall population in all 58 counties, according to state data."
31044,&gt;The disparity reveals a strong economic divide between the vaccinated and unvaccinated throughout California.
31045,"&gt;About 45% of Medi-Cal enrollees eligible for the COVID-19 vaccine (those 12 and older) had received at least one dose as of July 18, compared to about 70% of all eligible Californians, state officials said Thursday."
31046,What the state of Florida did during the early stages of vaccine distribution was work with Publix (who had a federal agreement with the CDC) to distribute vaccines in its stores.
31047,"Of course, to get a vaccine from Publix you need to live near a Publix, and disadvantage communities have historically been underserved by good grocery stores (food deserts, they call them)."
31048,That issue goes beyond DeSantis.
31049,"Eventually other stores, including Walmart, would start distributing the vaccine in Florida."
31050,"What Florida did was not let the perfect be the enemy of the good, and prioritized seniors regardless of whether it was the perfect distribution plan."
31051,"And after the hyperbolic Publix backlash, they did make efforts to get the vaccine into rural and minority communities, something that was probably already planned."

31056,"Vaccines beef up our body's defenses, and some individuals' defenses are being broken through, across all vaccines."
31057,"There are a lot of factors that contribute to those breakthrough infections, but what's important is that unless you're immunocompromised, your risk of serious illness is very, very low regardless of which (FDA-emergency-approved) vaccine you received."
31058,The vaccine is still offering you plenty of protection.

31062,Farmers are probably a bad example here.
31063,"Most farmers (even family farms) are moving hundreds of thousands, or even millions of dollars per year through their farms."
31064,"They don’t get to keep all that money obviously, but that’s the scale required to run a farm as a business these days."
31065,"When you’ve got that much cash flow, the stock market does have a real impact on how much you can sell your crops for."

31072,Hmm…
31073,Republicans just love you to death.
31074,Would you say the same if a governor prohibited banning abortion?
31075,Some active measures actually increase freedom.
31076,Well they are saying this variant has 1000 times more viral load than the original strain so no wonder why they can't contain it.
31077,"No, the vaccine is holding up well."
31078,"It holds up against severe symptoms / hospitalizations, but it does not hold up infection nowhere near as well."
31079,There's a big difference between the two.
31080,This is honestly probably the real way out… get vaccinated folks because unless you’re sheltering in place Delta is gonna catch up to ya.
31081,My clinic is no longer allowed to require facemasks because of Greg Abbott's executive order.
31082,My clinic is a state of Texas/ government entity.
31083,"We can ask them to wear masks but can't force them to, or we can be fined $1000."
31084,"Keep in mind also, none of the 882 people died."
31085,Zero.
31086,"&gt;Not that I’m advocating to just let it rip but at some point there is some temporary brick wall

This seems to be the way out."
31087,"What we're doing is essentially the opposite of ""flattening the curve"", we're letting infections run rampant, (at least among the unvaccinated) so that significant increase is quickly followed by a peak and an almost as significant decrease."
31088,The UK is a pretty good example of this currently.
31089,&gt;unless immunity from this just isn’t a thing at all and no one wants to tell anyone.
31090,"I suppose this is possible, but the steep drop-off in deaths and hospitalizations globally following vaccination campaigns would indicate it isn't the case."
31091,"At this point with Delta, you're either going to be vaccinated or you're going to catch it."
31092,"Potentially both, but breakthrough infections don't seem to be a given, and outcomes are typically mild illness (not unlike cold-causing coronaviruses)."
31093,"Which means that at some point, general spread naturally just has to slow down."
31094,Even future variants will eventually have a hard time propagating as there's a widespread baseline immunity to this virus in general.
31095,This gives me anxiety that people in unrelated medical emergencies won’t get timely treatment and suffer for others poor decisions.

31108,"(Not sure how its viewership stacks up numerically to Newsmax, but they're on the anti-vax train as well.)"

31110,"Your local area of Provincetown which I have never heard of and their apparent multi day gay orgies that you, for some reason, think everyone must know about is what I'm saying."
31111,People are not sheltered just because they are unaware of a niche thing that happens close to you.
31112,I'm guessing given the tone of your response that you aren't a parent.
31113,"Either am I, but I can sympathize with parents that are very concerned about long term, or other unknown side effects."
31114,Dr. Griffen on TWIV estimates about 1 in 30 kids to experience some form of 'long' covid.
31115,"Sounds high to me given news reports, but he repeats that regularly and is a respected doctor who handles these cases daily."
31116,"Of course, there isn't really any data at the moment as to whether vaccination would even prevent this in kids."
31117,Everything is bigger in Texas especially the stupidity.
31118,I love how these guys use big government to force local municipalities to do things while campaigning against bug government.
31119,The data on the right-hand side of [this document](https://1lnfej4c7wie44voctzq1r57-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Fact-Sheet_Workers-Need-Respirators.pdf) shows that a surgical mask can prevent you from getting an infectious dose for between 30 minutes to 50 hours based on what the infected person is wearing.
31120,Thats based on the person being within 6 feet of the infected for the whole time.
31121,That document appears to have been created in May before Delta really boomed so I'd say there's less protection now.
31122,Especially given that the time to get an infectious dose of Delta seems to be much lower.
31123,So to answer you question - no I dont think there is a Delta specific study out there.
31124,But surgical masks seem to offer good protection given that being 6 feet from someone who is infectious for 30 mins seems unlikely in most cases.
31125,N95 seems to be much better protection obviously.

31127,And the death rate here was….ready….ZERO.
31128,"Yep, Quebec has started offering people with one AstraZeneca and one mRNA an extra mRNA shot if they want to travel."
31129,"There's no safety data on doing this, of course, but logically it should be fine."
31130,The explanation is that people are ignorant as fuck and either don't believe the virus is real or don't think it's dangerous.
31131,Some Republicans are already backtracking their pro-covid stance and recommending vaccines now.
31132,They certainly don't want the virus to continue spreading because they're seeing that it's primarily killing the unvaccinated now.
31133,"The unvaccinated, worth noting here, is largely the GOPs base supporters."
31134,They're losing their own base.

31278,*
31279,Sorry to hear that.
31280,I've cut off anyone who doesn't take covid seriously.
31281,I have no tolerance for willfully ignorant people.
31282,I am going to copy this message and print it and bring it with me to my next appt LOL thank you.
31283,"You are right, there are so many articles out there that are bad telling us not to take vaccine etc :("
31284,"I live in a very well vaccinated, liberal area."
31285,"Mask usage in the last few days has seemed to go up a bit, but not even close to 100% like it was for most of the past 18 months."
31286,It does feel like socially people are pretty over all of this.
31287,"I don’t know whether that’s good or bad, but interesting to notice."
31288,People won't do it.
31289,Public health policy requires buy in and proposing social distancing won't get buy in.
31290,I'm in Springfield MO Delta Central for two months.
31291,One of our hospitals just announced 6 deaths of vaccinated.
31292,Average age was 77 and most were immunocompromised
31293,How big is the risk of an unmasked fully-vaccinated person (Moderna) spreading coronavirus to unvaccinated people they don't live with?
31294,Have any studies been conducted which give hard numbers on this?
31295,I'm trying to decide on what my personal policy will be going forward since I don't think enough Americans will ever be vaccinated to achieve herd immunity.
31296,"No one in my household is unvaccinated, but I'm worried about strangers at the grocery store, mall, movie theater, etc."
31297,I'm trying to decide whether or not to just resolve to mask-up in public forever (at least in indoor spaces).
31298,I disagree with this.
31299,"In most circumstances, a business should be able to decide who they associate themselves with, and this applies under circumstances not related to the pandemic."
31300,"This is a big government, authoritarian style move that should be condemned."
31301,Can we stop with creating percentages using total vaccinated people in the country.
31302,It’s almost as bad as some the calculation antivaxers use.
31303,You can do the same thing by calculating how many unvaccinated cases there are as a percent of unvaccinated people in the country.
31304,It will also be a meaningless small percentage.
31305,The best way to show this correctly is the risk of an unvaccinated person getting Covid compared to the risk of a vaccinated person getting Covid.
31306,Variants change the name of the game - we as a society need to be ready to pivot without throwing a tantrum.
31307,[removed]
31308,Agreed.
31309,How in the hell can you be with someone when your world view is that opposed?
31310,I have seen titles like that.
31311,It is a fact that minorities in low-paying industries had to continue working the frontlines.
31312,"More exposure time  to CV19, the more cases in their communities."
31313,"Also, a higher percentage of multi-gen households increases the chance of CV19 cases."
31314,"Great, what comes after Delta?"
31315,The next variant should be named after the state that gave birth to it.
31316,To me this just means that covid will burn through the population quickly.
31317,"As bad as the US is, there's around 50% full vaccination and probably an additional 10-20% that have prior immunity, this won't last forever, reinfection is rare, and even one shot of a covid vaccine grants significant protection."
31318,I made a similar comment last night.
31319,The slides clearly weren’t meant for public consumption or to be an exhaustive presentation of the information they contained.
31320,One of the slides even was labeled “confidential data subject to change.
31321,"“ There most likely was a presentation presented with the slides with information about study methodology, sampling characteristics, the full key for the graphs of their models, caveats, and other context."
31322,Yet now you have people going around making authoritative statements as if they were in the room.
31323,"Hmm, in hindsight the metaphor is a bit mixed."
31324,Maybe GA needs to be a desert... Or Atlanta needs to be an island
31325,[removed]
31326,"If I’m fully vaccinated (which I am) and the vaccine still works well against severe illness and death, then why do I still need to take precaution?"
31327,"If getting COVID is similar to a bad cold for the vaccinated, then why?"
31328,Do we wear masks during flu seasons?
31329,The shift in narrative is so frustrating.
31330,Screaming that the vaccines still can get you infected but stop death is not enough of a motive to get the unvaccinated to get vaccinated.
31331,These are mostly the same people who have been yelling since the start that COVID is a 99% survival as it is.
31332,"Free to die in the cold when you have no electricity, free to die due to COVID, free to die due to poverty."
31333,Just free to die in general.

31346,I don't entirely disagree with you but I don't entirely agree either.
31347,I suspect that they're blaming the unvaccinated for two reasons.
31348,1.
31349,The vaccine does offer significant protection and the vast majority of people spreading Covid right now are unvaccinated.
31350,2.
31351,They are hoping to get vaccination rates increased by blaming the unvaccinated.
31352,I'm not defending any distortion of data.

31357,"I exercise my autonomy by getting vaccinated and wearing a seatbelt…but I do those things by choice, not by force."
31358,Not sure what is so hard to understand about that.
31359,I'm in Springfield MO Delta Central for two months.
31360,"I talked to a customer who got it a second time with Delta and he told me it was living hell nothing like the first

Everybody I know that has not been vaccinated that gets Delta tries to check themselves in the hospital because they can't breathe"
31361,"If the R of chickenpox was 3.7-5 amongst vaccinated people, we'd be in a constant state of an overwhelming number of chickenpox cases."
31362,"He is literally limiting government from acting, how much simpler could it be?"
31363,My mother has watched Fox News for decades and she didn’t start acting over the top emotional and extremely one sided about politics until she got on Facebook….so yeah I believe this.
31364,Now I saw an article about how fully vaccinated people likely spread the delta variant at the same rates as unvaccinated people
31365,Yikes.
31366,"And no, I’m not talking about that completely unfortunate hairstyle."
31367,Stay safe up there.
31368,Like what do we even do!?
31369,They’ve thrown our children to the wolves
31370,Fox News is a sewer.

31374,That sounds like such an ordeal to go through.
31375,My mother has watched Fox News for decades and she didn’t start acting over the top emotional and extremely one sided about politics until she got on Facebook….so yeah I believe this.
31376,"Any rational thinking person will, of course, not *want* to get COVID, but that same rational thinking person will come to the conclusion that being vaccinated reduces the risk of getting it as well as the risk of being hospitalized by it if they do get it."
31377,"And if the vaccinated individual's symptoms are reduced/subdued (in comparison to an unvaccinated person), then risk of transmission is reduced as well."
31378,"Im really starting to feel republicans want this to never end while making it worse by doing silly things like no masks, no eviction moratorium, no pua."

31393,"Frankly neither job pays me enough, or gives a rat's ass if I get covid, mugged, or my head split open while skating, but putting restrictions on safety measures because management doesn't like how the safety measures slow down normal operations."
31394,The fucking pizza place had 4 FOH get covid and they told me to tell customers that our foh was on vacation so we closed for a few days.
31395,"The Sanic managers get pissy about anything we do for safety, and the other day one of the dipshit assistant managers said 'we aren't doing masks anymore.'"
31396,"Whatever, gotta scadooo, what you gotta scadoooooooooooo."
31397,Reminder that Abbott lifted the mask mandate when only 7% of Texans were vaccinated just to distract from the winter storm that killed 175+ people

31450,The latest science is that vaccinated people spread Delta variant.
31451,This means the unmasked post-vaccinated people are the most responsible for the renewed precautions in the U.S.  Rolling back precautions for the vaccinated people let businesses off the hook from finding ways to safely reopen.
31452,I am vaccinated.
31453,"Once the messaging that vaccination equaled immunity was out, I felt forced to be present at social events again."
31454,"Just like pre-COVID, if I felt a little sick, I would take some Dayquil and power through the gathering."
31455,"I read between the lines on the CDC site that vaccinated people could still spread COVID and the variants, but it seemed like no one else cared about this."
31456,The CDC and national messaging is much more explicit and clear now.
31457,"All of us should be masking, distancing, and maintaining hygiene."
31458,"We will get through this, but businesses are going to have to have to make long-term adjustments that find the balance between the minimal capacity we saw last year and the pre-COVID free for all that we saw this summer."

31460,I appreciate the response
31461,"https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/covid-19/clinical-considerations/covid-19-vaccines-us.html#Contraindications

There are very few contraindications to the vaccine."
31462,"75% effective at cancelling infection

87% effective at cancelling disease

90% effective at preventing hospitalization

Death: unknown, likely upper 90s

Reducing transmission once infected: not effective."
31463,According to the CDC PowerPoint if you take worst case numbers.
31464,"Still lots of reasons to be vaccinated, but also to take additional precautions."
31465,And the rest of Georgia is a far cry from Atlanta.

31480,Wow
31481,"He’s really sick, but didn’t end up in the ER like me"
31482,It's a bad take because the CDC has confirmed that vaccinated can still transmit the virus and at a higher rate than with alpha variant.
31483,These folks have ensured personal safety but aren't following guidelines to protect the community.
31484,"It's not just antivaxers who will die, it will be people with normal medical issues who will die as well due to overrun hospitals."
31485,"They also currently receive one for Junin Virus and Chikungunua Fever, neither or which are FDA approved if deploying into certain areas."

31496,"Still, the ease with which the Delta variant passes from one person to another has caught public health experts by surprise."
31497,"During a June outbreak in Australia, where the virus had been previously well controlled despite an extremely low vaccination rate, New South Wales Health Minister Jeroen Weimar warned that transmission had occurred with only “fleeting contact” between individuals."
31498,"For example, contact tracing and genomic sequencing showed that a woman in her 70s was infected while sitting outside a cafe visited by “Patient Zero,” an airport limo driver."
31499,"In another instance, the virus seems to have been transmitted in the time it took for two unmasked strangers to pass each other in a shopping center, an encounter captured by mall security cameras."

31628,just get vaccinated and do the stuff you used to before this started.
31629,"Everything is still open, nothing is shut down yet."
31630,I’ve commented this before but I’m not shocked.
31631,The 12-15 vaccination is just now slowly going up but I really think the 11-5 group and the under 5 group will be even less.
31632,Anti vaxxers with kids won’t vaccinate their kids of course and then there will be a group of people who got vaccinated but won’t use an “experimental” vaccine on their children.
31633,Plus any school vaccine mandate has a religious exemption and most states just require you check a box and nothing else
31634,So 1 million a day for 90 days = 90 million people = today's unvaccinated.
31635,Done by October.
31636,If your vaccinated you can just do whatever and at worst you get a mild flu
31637,[removed]
31638,Who could've guessed the state passing a law prohibiting businesses for asking for proof of vaccination would have the highest rate of COVID?
31639,Never saw that one coming!
31640,Is there a way to check what the percentage rate in NYC were by dates?
31641,Would like to see what it was when I got sick.
31642,"That’s a lie they tell, like freedom, and responsibility."
31643,What are you doing about it?
31644,Honest question.

31647,It's too late for him to put the cat back in the bag.
31648,The problems are noticeable to the average Floridian now.
31649,People I know living down there are modifying their behavior again and canceling plans out of caution.
31650,"That group isn't as loud as covid deniers and antivaxxers, but it's a much larger group than people realize."
31651,"The flip side is, though, I know people up north still planning Florida vacations, so he still has someone to pander to"
31652,Fly to America?
31653,We're basically giving them away to anyone who'll take them

31658,or something to that effect.
31659,For sure.
31660,"I am definitely taking this all to heart, and will be monitoring the situation."
31661,The CDC should be giving out more data today as well.
31662,And I get that Delta is no joke.
31663,"We went from 24 cases on June 28th with many days in the 20's/30's prior, to over 200 cases yesterday in a popular tourist region."
31664,"Last summer when we were in the 20s/30s and restrictions were loosened, it took until October to get there."
31665,"In Portugal (we were one the first countries to be affected by Delta), cases have grown since June but this week we have seen a decrease in the numbe rof cases and our Rt is already below 1."
31666,"Also, this wave only reached a maximum of 3300 cases/day while in the second wave (October-November) we reached 6500 cases/day and in the third wave (December - January) we reached 13000 cases/day"
31667,Thanks for all you do
31668,"Oh sure, not at all, I was just chuckling a bit at the fact something had a mortality rate at all and parents were like “where do I sign my kid up?” But I know it was to prevent a more serious illness down the line."
31669,"Good point though about numbers and fear — the term “500% higher mortality rate” sounds scary, right?"
31670,"So many coronavirus headlines include numbers these days, hard to put it all in perspective."
31671,“Are these scary numbers or not scary numbers?”
31672,It will in most people.
31673,Not all.
31674,Imagine thinking the biggest problem facing your state is people wearing masks because of a virus which has already killed 600k Americans.
31675,"And by up, you mean down."
31676,Haha!
31677,It’s perfectly consistent.
31678,Texans don’t want the government telling them what to do.
31679,Hot Wheelz says “the government won’t be telling you what to do.” At no point did he say don’t wear a mask.

31889,The overwhelming majority of those that are vaccinated will be fine with DELTA.

31911,For the most part most highly vaccinated areas don't have to worry about much
31912,Just get tested when you get back (free testing is still widely available everywhere) and don’t go home until you test negative.

31928,"With hospitals at capacity, about two-thirds of adult patients are in isolation at home, which increases the chance that children will be infected, said Edhie Rahmat, executive director for Indonesia at the nonprofit health-care group Project HOPE."
31929,"Infants are also put at risk by the tradition of friends and neighbors visiting a newborn’s home to celebrate the birth, he said."
31930,"“These newborns are being released from hospitals with negative Covid-19 status, but later contracting Covid-19 and dying after being visited by neighbors and extended family members,” Mr. Edhie said."

31983,My observation is that public facing government materials will only cite other public documents and they won’t cite internal data that might be draft or not fully vetted yet but which they are using to make ongoing policy decisions.
31984,A lot of the time the communications team and policy research advice and analysis teams are playing catch up with each other and their internal processes for vetting and approval factoids in information.

32033,I feel like the right is trying to destabilize the country so another coup can happen.
32034,"You can still spread the Delta variant even if you're vaccinated and if you're in a community full of non-vaccinated people, people can still die who got covid-19 from you."
32035,"Also, if we keep having so much covid-19, it's inevitable that we'll have a variant that completely evades the current vaccines."
32036,What worries me most right now is that only 14% of the world is fully vaccinated against covid-19.
32037,"So, in a country where we have plenty of vaccine available, we're not just making it worse for ourselves."
32038,It's like a country-scale example of why masking and vaccinating isn't just about you as an individual.
32039,The point of the article is mutations will continue to evolve into new variants that escape vaccines  and natural immunity.

32202,It’s been packed all summer.
32203,I know they had a large outbreak a few weeks ago there
32204,"Not to mention the fact that the CDC estimated 115 million infections by end of March 2021 (35% of the population), that we've many more infections since then, and more studies keep finding recovered people to have levels of immunity similar to vaccinated people."
32205,"Before long, we're going to run out of people who have neither been infected nor injected."
32206,"And at that point, it may still spread, but not at levels like now, and we'll all be strongly protected against hospitalization and death if we do catch it."
32207,"Short answer, pre-Delta it wasn't too bad."
32208,"Now we don't know, but it's looking worse."
32209,And bullshit like this is why we still are dealing with this.
32210,Imagine if these idiots had just bothered to wear masks a year ago.
32211,This makes me wonder if the fact I can barely breathe through my nose is why I never got COVID when I was surrounded by it in close quarters for weeks (whole family got it but me).
32212,"I was getting coughed on and had plenty of physical contact, shit seemed to have bounced right off me."
32213,We were averaging around 217k 1st doses at the start of the month to around 339k 1st doses a day now.
32214,"https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#vaccination-trends

We peaked at doing over 2.5 million doses a day around spring."
32215,So we’re still moving waaay slower than we could be moving.
32216,"Delta and workplace requirements are motivating some people to get shots, but we’ve got a LOT of work to do."
32217,"Correct my cocktail napkin math if I’m wrong, but it looks this pace would take us well over a year to vaccinate the rest of the eligible population."
32218,"😬

(Thinking that we probably have 125-150 million unvaxed eligible folks, and we’re only getting 0.34m 1st shots into arms a day)"
32219,"That would mean the vaccinated are the ones who are a danger to the unvaccinated, not the other way around."
32220,That's why I'm glad I'm vaxxed up.
32221,it could be that UK is way more vaccinated than the US so there's far less risk of overwhelmed hospitals like there is in the US.
32222,"If people are spreading covid in the UK, but the majority are asymptomatic or mild due to vaccines, then it's less of a concern then in the US where some areas have &lt; 40% vaccine uptake."
32223,Republicans only want smaller government when Democrats are in office.
32224,"Reagan, Bush &amp; Trump and every Republican congress since, has only grown our budget"
32225,Any possibility of attenuation of the variant itself?
32226,Some vital deletion somewhere in it's code that can't be worked around and just hasn't been identified yet?
32227,Probably not since the UK does more sequencing than anyone.
32228,Wishful thinking on my part....
32229,Israel still has far lower cases than UK in a per capita basis.
32230,Ron DeSantis is possibly the dumbest human on the planet.

32232,"&gt; If a spike doesn't show up in a rolling average, it isn't a spike - it's just normal fluctuation."
32233,Sorry - you are wrong.
32234,A well measured spike over time is a well measured spike over time.
32235,Period.
32236,Read up on the basics of FWHM and data measurements.
32237,"This is the kind of irresponsible grade-school level understanding which I see climate deniers use to argue that climate change isn't happening confusing weather and climate, that dangerous levels of nitrates in water shouldn't be reported until it can be averaged down confusing daily ingestion with weekly, that lead in gas wasn't so bad because the rise in lead in local water wasn't a real spike, .... etc."

32374,Because it’s not constitutional to ban abortion there isn’t a need for a governor to prohibit towns and cities to proactively prevent towns and cities from banning it.

32469,The real problem is that our *politics* aren't working.
32470,"We've landed on a two party system where one party is ran by a combination of people with the mentality of murderous children who deny any ounce reality that doesn't suit them and actual Human scum who all too willing to lie to and take advantage of the first group, while the other party is made up of people who don't have the stones and/or common fucking sense to so much as even recognize what the other party is doing, nevermind actually do anything meaningful about it."
32471,"American democracy is fucking dying every day, all because people like Abbot are allowed to take courses of action that will clearly (read; painfully obvious to anyone with a working brain) lead to otherwise preventable and needless deaths, all for political and economic gain, and no one will actually hold them accountable for it."
32472,"American democracy is dying as a direct result of one of the parties actively poisoning it in the never-ending effort to accrue more power and deceive the people, while the other party just marches on business as usual."
32473,American democracy is being murdered because the politicians who have the political majority continue to view those who are committing this slow and painful murder in broad daylight as valid political rivals rather than what they truly are; *enemies of the people who openly abuse and corrupt our democracy for their own gain while turning their actually brainwashed base into easily controlled pawns at best and legitimate domestic terrorists at worst.
32474,"*

The divide that has happened in America, that allows people like Abbot to retain power no matter what, is so great that the people on each side of that divide might as well be living in entirely different realities from each other."
32475,"That divide is just not going to be healed until either the political majority mans up and drags the political minority into reality kicking and screaming, or the political minority gets truly desperate and plunges us into a civil war and/or total authoritarianism and we the people are *forced* to violence."
32476,There is zero future where business as usual in this country's politics doesn't seriously risk destroying the United States at this rate.
32477,Abbott has proven time and time again he will not do the right thing.
32478,He will do the Republican thing.

32533,"You haven't noticed a difference, but that's expected."
32534,"Keep in mind, it's not just to protect you."
32535,We know that vaccinated people can be asymptomatic spreaders.
32536,"&gt; If you enjoy living like that, then I’m sure 2020 was a fucking breeze, so it makes sense that **some people are eager to bring masking back so we can return to how things were last year."

32542,"Exactly, and why are they not talking about it?"
32543,I feel im being put at risk of long covid or permanent damage with no knowledge on what the risk to me is so I can make no informed decisions.
32544,The anti-mask thing drives me crazy.
32545,Why is it such a big deal to wear a mask?
32546,My 3-year-old can do it without complaining.
32547,It is still a brazenly stupid move even from the political expediency angle.
32548,"Elections in Florida tend to be decided by narrow margins and a net loss of even 10,000-20,000 of his voter base could have dire political consequences for him."
32549,I completely agree.
32550,Masks are a barrier to social interaction.
32551,They can actually inhibit socialization and development in children.
32552,I wore my mask until mid May when the mandates started dropping.
32553,I've needed it a few times since and every time I'm reminded of how much I hate masks.
32554,Seeing masked faces for who knows how long sounds very dystopian and miserable.
32555,There are absolutely downsides to masks and I will never understand forever maskers.
32556,I truly wonder when some of these people will give it up.
32557,This pandemic has certainly enabled antisocial behavior for a lot of people.

32781,Israel is already recommending immune compromised kids under 12 get vaccinated now I believe.
32782,"Part of the problem with getting vaccines out fast enough to those who wanted them in the U.S. was the moralizing of when people would get it and jumping the line... then come to find out, half the country doesn't want them anyway."
32783,I think we could have figured that out a lot sooner if there were less moralizing and sitting around waiting for people to show up from December to February.
32784,"The U.K. kind of did this by going the one-shot route at first and reaching volume, then worrying about second doses."
32785,Knowing there'd be this many people unwilling to be vaccinated would have been helpful information to have a lot sooner.
32786,You also would have had more single dose people with some level of protection because news of how rough that 2nd shot could be would have taken longer to get out.
32787,"So this whole ""less honest people are going to start getting one anyway"" sounds more to me like ""people who would like to live and no longer trust (RIGHTFULLY SO) the veracity of the information being given out"", especially when it leans towards, ""It's all fine, everything is great here, time to get back to the office/restaurant/mass transit/school, etc."

&gt; Data from a July 4 outbreak on Cape Cod, in Massachusetts, appears to have led CDC Director Rochelle Walensky earlier this week to recommend that fully vaccinated people wear a mask indoors in public spaces if they live in areas where the spread of the virus is currently ""substantial"" or ""high."""
32903,"&gt;In that outbreak, vaccinated and unvaccinated people had nearly the same amount of virus recovered from test samples, indicating that vaccinated people are just as contagious as unvaccinated people when it comes to the delta variant."
32904,"&gt;With previous strains, vaccinated people who became infected with the coronavirus had much lower levels of virus, meaning they were less contagious."
32905,&gt;That may have now changed.
32906,"Kids under 12 can’t get vaccinated, and they start school here in TX in 2 weeks."
32907,Should they continue to hole up and not live life because the adults in their community won’t vax or mask to protect them?

32935,I'm saying this from a purely academic perspective...
32936,Doing what the GOP is doing is one of the fastest ways in theory to ensure a revolution.
32937,Particularly a Marxist one as written on paper.
32938,Marxism was formed in the wake of the excesses of Victorian-era Industrial Revolution.
32939,"You know, the workhouses, the indigent families that couldn't afford medicine, orphanages filled to the brim with unwanted, uncared for children, out-of-touch wealthy elites... 

You know, the stuff Dickens wrote about because the two were contemporaries, saw the same stuff, and more than likely knew and influenced each other."
32940,"Dickensian is meant to be a pejorative, not an aspiration."
32941,And it all sounds like what the GOP is aiming for.
32942,"And per the *Communist Manifesto* and *Das Kapital*, that's asking for a revolution."
32943,"But as we are well aware, the GOP isn't exactly savvy about what Marxism or Marx actually said, and I'm sure they're no more educated on Dickens and other writers of the time..."
32944,Post-vaccination the risk is at the level of things we live with all the time already and don't shame people for failing to cower from.
32945,"The big threat is all the unvaxxed people, and they're GOING to catch it and spread it, masks or no."
32946,"Masks can slow down how long it takes for all them to spread it, once we've all had it (or had the shot) the spread will be at a much lower level."

33080,It sucks that the vaccine campaign wasn't fast enough to make reimplementing the mask mandate unnecessary.
33081,"The mandate will go away when enough people are immune, even though that's not yet."
33082,0 reason to think about permanent masks.
33083,Not if you completely abandon having any time to yourself.
33084,The leaked CDC presentation literally says vaccines reduce your risk of hospitalisation and death 25 fold.
33085,That should have been the headline.
33086,"\*Sentences thousands to death, which is not that far from the norm in Texas."

33092,It's absolutely caused by wobbles in a very reliable weekly trend.
33093,"It almost ALWAYS goes down at the weekend, and it almost ALWAYS goes up midweek."
33094,"Newspapers have taken advantage of this in both directions, with some writing ""EVERYTHING IS FINE COVID IS OVER"" articles during the weekend drops that form part of an overall rise, and other papers currently writing the scary sounding articles about 2 days of cases going up that we saw yesterday."
33095,It's all BS intended to confound those who haven't been following the stats closely enough to see the weekly patterns.
33096,Can you do the same calculation for an unvaccinated person?
33097,"Again, you won’t see much of a difference in the numbers unless you calculate relative risk and not absolute risk."
33098,You think Pfizer is going to sell at a loss?
33099,[removed]
33100,Yes.
33101,The article says there are lots of other infections too right now - and then trying to safely manage the covid patients to not expose non Covid patients is all part of the challenge and risks to all pediatric patients.
33102,Might as well close em down
33103,Shocker
33104,"Sure, yes I linked to the press release because it's easier to understand for many people but as you can see they've submitted their data for peer review."
33105,"Now, the question you should be asking those who are infected is what is the severity of their infection and is it limiting disease?"
33106,"Because that was the end goal of every vaccine being developed, preventing infections was not."
33107,You seem to have a delusion that locking the country down and getting the virus to zero will keep it at zero.
33108,"If there's not enough immunity to keep it from spreading, it will just spread again once it's reintroduced."
33109,"Unless somehow the entirety of the world from the US to the packed slums of Brazil and India to the mountain of Afghanistan to the war torn and displaced populations in the middle east ALL simultaneously reduce the virus to zero, it just starts spreading again."
33110,"And YOU just admitted that vaccination won't be enough to stop it, so you are aware that what I have said is true."
33111,"Look, I get it."
33112,Covid sucks and you want it to go away.
33113,You don't want to live in a world where it exists.
33114,You're willing to do ANYTHING to make it go away.
33115,But wishing won't make it happen.
33116,"All the extreme measures you're willing to go through to try to eradicate it won't wipe it off the Earth, and it'll just be back to greet us once we take away the extreme measures."
33117,Sometimes life sucks and things we don't want to happen happen.
33118,Covid's one of those things.
33119,The genie isn't going back in the bottle.
33120,Covid lives with us now.
33121,Yeah but your odds of contracting covid sans any vaccines was still relatively low for most people.
33122,Now take into account the odds of contracting covid are greatly reduced by vaccines.
33123,The emphasis on breakthrough viral loads was always misguided.
33124,It was always possible (even based on previous studies) that breakthrough cases could spread virus now it’s just more likely.
33125,But even in the worst cases scenario if you and your loved ones are vaccinated it’s very unlikely for anyone to experience a severe case of covid.
33126,So it's pretty fucking obvious the GOP are just going with doing the opposite of the left.
33127,So can the left like start going balls to the wall GOP talking points and shift the GOP into doing the right thing.

33132,"If it were up to me, we would have vaccine passports and school mandates."

33134,We can’t just give up because we are “done with it”.
33135,That’s now how any of this works and never has.
33136,People in previous plagues or challenging times don’t get to give up.

33145,"A preview of what Delta may do here, as it is elsewhere:  [https://www.nytimes.com/2021/07/25/world/asia/children-deaths-virus-indonesia.html](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/07/25/world/asia/children-deaths-virus-indonesia.html)

The relevant bit:  ""More than 150 children died from Covid-19 during the week of July 12 alone, he said, with half the recent deaths involving those younger than 5...More than 800 children in Indonesia under the age of 18 have died from the virus since the pandemic began, Dr. Aman said, but the majority of those deaths have occurred only in the past month."""
33146,"In other words, Delta is killing children at alarming rates."
33147,"Meanwhile, school transportation related crashes, per NHTSA--these include all involved parties, be they the children, a pedestrian hit by a schoolbus, the person who hit the bus, etc:  [https://crashstats.nhtsa.dot.gov/Api/Public/ViewPublication/812476](https://crashstats.nhtsa.dot.gov/Api/Public/ViewPublication/812476)

Basically you're looking at maybe 100-150 fatalities a year, and of those only 281 school-age children died in school-transportation-related-crashes between 2007 and 2016."
33148,An average somewhere below 30 a year.
33149,Wanna know how many kids died from COVID here in the US since the pandemic began?
33150,Somewhere just over 520 so far.
33151,"Oh, and the southern states leading the COVID scoreboard right now are reporting record numbers of pediatric hospitalizations for COVID not seen at any point previously in this pandemic."
33152,"[https://www.forbes.com/sites/jemimamcevoy/2021/07/29/hospitals-in-southern-us-reporting-record-numbers-of-children-hospitalized-amid-delta-surge-though-deaths-still-extremely-rare/?sh=564fe99f5f1e](https://www.forbes.com/sites/jemimamcevoy/2021/07/29/hospitals-in-southern-us-reporting-record-numbers-of-children-hospitalized-amid-delta-surge-though-deaths-still-extremely-rare/?sh=564fe99f5f1e)

So to recap, in case you're bad at math, we've shown that evidence supports the notion that Delta is hospitalizing and killing children at rates higher than previous strains of COVID, that school-aged children die on their way to and from school in vehicle-related accidents at a rate of less than 30 a year, and that over the course of the pandemic, children in the United States have been dying at a rate of 300ish a year, with that rate looking likely to now increase with the more dangerous Delta variant running unchecked and the fall school semester rapidly approaching with no safety measures in place."
33153,"COVID = 10x as deadly as traffic accidents en route to or from school, and that was before Delta, which is proving to be thus far unquantifiably more dangerous than previous strains were, in particular to children."
33154,How much worse is yet to be seen.

33158,She sleeps when they sleep and I sleep after work (or after staying up until 3am because that’s the only way I get any free time).
33159,combine a highly virulent variant with people refusing to get vaccinated and you have issues.
33160,I wonder what's the common factor in these States?
33161,"&gt;If policymakers want to change their minds, they have to change their calculations by raising the costs of remaining unvaccinated, the benefits of getting vaccinated or both."
33162,"If they can’t do that, or won’t, the vaccination effort will most likely remain stuck — at least until a variant wreaks sufficient carnage to change the calculus."
33163,"https://www.nytimes.com/2021/07/29/opinion/covid-vaccine-hesitancy.html

This is ultimately where I fall on this issue."
33164,"Persuasion has been demonstrated to be highly ineffective, in fact the attempt at persuasion seems to only cause individuals to become more set in their thinking, and is costing hundreds of thousands of lives."
33165,"If behavior is to change, behavior must be acted upon to change, and that requires incentives and punishments."
33166,There's been talk recently of $100 checks for getting vaccinated.
33167,There are lotteries.
33168,I think the country should continue to seek to generate as many carrots as possible to generate incentive to get vaccinated.
33169,But we also need the stick.
33170,"More and more companies, especially in healthcare, are requiring proof of full vaccination from those who can be vaccinated for employment."
33171,I'm entirely in favor of that.
33172,We're also looking a mandate for Federal workers and possible a military requirement as well.
33173,Fantastic.
33174,"If you would still like the benefits of a functioning society, you must contribute to the safety of that society in the form of responsible personal behavior, and that includes not 1) spreading the disease), 2) costing us valuable healthcare resources, and 3) not being an incubator for variants."
33175,**We need more carrot and stick thinking and to stop wasting our time on persuasion**.
33176,You can't persuade someone who thinks there are microchips in injections or sees this death toll and thinks it's a lie or who get medical information off Facebook and from political pundits.

33181,Cloth masks were ok against the original COVID but now that we have delta which is apparently 1000x viral load and spreads as easily as chickenpox with an r8 is a cloth mask even going to be anywhere near as effective now?
33182,Shouldn’t we be pushing for higher quality masking?
33183,Excellent.
33184,"Not to say that isn’t a good sign but that study only included 4,000 delta cases and was done in the UK."
33185,The UK had a completely different timetable of when people received their second dose versus US and Israel.
33186,I think they did 8 weeks between dose 1 and 2.
33187,There seems to be evidence that a larger gap between the doses provides a longer lasting immune response.

33208,"Cold, of course."
33209,Flu everyone should get vaccinated for but the vaccine varies in efficacy year-to-year so you just kinda have to accept the risk.
33210,Covid has killed over 600K Americans thus far.
33211,If you tally up the CDC's flu deaths for the past *decade* you get 359K.
33212,(https://www.cdc.gov/flu/about/burden/past-seasons.html).
33213,And the Covid vaccines are *way* more effective than flu vaccines usually are.
33214,"so no, I am not okay with a disease that has killed almost twice the amount of people in one year as the flu has killed in a decade *and* has a free and super-effective vaccine."

33228,"Certainly an important point, and with peoples’ nature to focus on the negatives over the positives (myself included), it is being glossed over."
33229,The mRNA vaccines remain an amazing accomplishment and very much the most important tool in our kit to combat this disease.
33230,The concern with this report stems from a few things.
33231,Delta cases have much higher viral loads - we know what that means.
33232,"Until recent events, it was assumed that interaction between vaccinated individuals was incredibly safe and presented a very minimal risk of infection if one or more parties were sick @ the time of interaction - this too has changed (we need to consider both symptomatic and asymptomatic)."
33233,"With how easily Delta spreads with its sky high R0 value, our legitimately vulnerable population - I speak now specifically of children - is at an even increased risk."
33234,"We want this shit to end:  
 - no more deaths   
 - no more hospitalizations   
 - no more sickness    
 - no more cases   

Delta has shifted all of these to varying levels."
33235,"Arguably from my standpoint is that we need to do our best to eliminate cases, which Delta makes it very hard to do."
33236,"Simply put, like so many others point out, it is the continued wave after wave of infections that bring new variants that is the biggest threat to our ending this."
33237,We simply must stop the virus and its many variants from continuing to have the chance to evolve.
33238,Florida needs to lock down at this point.
33239,Masks are not enough
33240,The PM in Aus has pretty much continuously gaslit the entire population over the last several years and the harsh lockdown in VIC broke a lot of people.
33241,"I think theres just a general defeated feeling amongst a portion of the population, probably the same ones who follow along with COVID news and subreddits."
33242,The rest of the population would seem to cease to care about COVID as soon as the cases hit zero.
33243,Everything is an individual choice right now.
33244,A cloth mask is the wrong choice.

33246,"I can't even convince my unvaccinated friends in massachusetts to get poked, even without being a dick about it."

33248,"This video gives a good breakdown of the current literature and how it may apply to Delta:

https://youtu.be/5RWGh19yTXw

Also, immunity is not a binary immune/not immune state."
33249,"Based on your prior infection you've already have some type of immunity, but there are various factors, some which may be specific to you, that determine this degree of immunity."
33250,"That being said, the current understanding is that previously infected individuals, who have received at least one dose of a vaccine are likely very well protected from all known variants"
33251,No coincidence that a high percentage of these states rank at the bottom in terms of quality/prevalence of education amongst their populace.

33267,"China is still vaccinating at 10-20 million doses daily, so they'll be ahead of the US soon in terms of shots."
33268,Although you are right that they cannot compare natural immunity to the US where maybe 25-30% of the population have already caught the virus.
33269,"Still it looks like China is on pace to finish vaccinating the bulk of their population by fall, and starting in the fall they can start giving boosters, either a third dose of their inactivated shots, or they can use mRNA or other shots as a booster."

33271,How does that help politically?
33272,I don't think mitigation policies are widely popular.

33366,"If they can't see it, it can't see them."
33367,"Texas and Florida, making the Democrats job at midterms easier by each death!"
33368,"The CDC's guidance is changing because the virus is changing, and because we get more data every day."
33369,"Still, their messaging last year was less than impressive."
33370,The previous administration's attempts to cripple them only excuses so much.
33371,"Eh, I got J&amp;J and am not concerned."
33372,"It’s easy to get swept up in the news cycle and think things are falling apart, but a more careful reading of the news shows this is really a surge driven by the unvaccinated."
33373,"Sure, more vaccinated are getting sick and spreading it than before, but the hospitals are not filling up with vaccinated individuals."
33374,"Getting a minor flu doesn’t worry me, dying does, and so far there hasn’t been a ton of evidence that delta carries a more significant risk for the vaccinated, just a more significant risk of spreading/showing symptoms."
33375,I really hate to see this and it just sucks because I don't know what the solution will be.
33376,It has to come to extreme measures eventually if it keeps going this way.
33377,Strikes by medical workers and such.
33378,"If things just continue like this, why wouldn't healthcare workers just quit?"
33379,They will reach a breaking point.
33380,How to Kill Your Constituents 101
33381,Man.
33382,"Think of all of the peripheral deaths that are going to happen from economic destabilization, canceling treatment/surgeries for other diseases, etc."
33383,I'm probably on the side of worrying about this more than most sane people but holy crap.
33384,I don't see how we get through this without severe pain on a level we've never seen before.
33385,Yeah I read all the slides and it’s pretty clear that the vaccines are about as effective as they’ve always been in the real world.
33386,"It’s not even really clear if they’re less effective against Delta, or if there’s just more Delta circulating."
33387,WaPo had the whole presentation and it’s really not the doomsday scenario the media is portraying it as.
33388,"Get vaccinated if you’re not, wear a mask in hot spots until the cases go back down."
33389,Individual risk for relatively healthy vaccinated people remains low.
33390,We’re going to cycle through variants and outbreaks for years.
33391,"Vaccines are free, safe, and effective."
33392,"Get one, mask when current local infections indicate masking."
33393,"Otherwise, get on with your lives."
33394,Feeling more hopeless now than ever.
33395,At least at the start/middle we had a light at the end of the tunnel.
33396,The vaccines were the answer.
33397,We were updated about the progress and it gave us hope.
33398,Now what?
33399,There’s nothing.
33400,Mask up the rest of our lives??
33401,I don’t want to do that.
33402,Businesses now requiring employees to wear masks and not customers (though that will be next).
33403,How pointless is that??
33404,Really thought my kid would have a semblance of normalcy his first year at school but here we are…things just seem worse than ever.

33409,But only COVID-19 has been turned into a political weapon despite the massive number of casualties.This is truly the GOP at their most repulsive
33410,I think in your response you feel into the same actions.
33411,"It’s a complicated, ever changing situation."
33412,In your response you said “despite ICU doctors throughout India reporting that younger…” that was an anecdote at the time.
33413,You know how many Anecdotes throughout this have been misdirections?
33414,Hundreds.
33415,This sub is actually very pro science most of the time.
33416,It’s just that the virus and thus the underlying science keeps pivoting.
33417,I think the consensus at this point is correct.
33418,Delta is a mutation and is putting more people at risk.
33419,"If you have 2 doses of MRNA you still have one of the most effective vaccines on the planet running through your veins, keeping you safe for the most part (whether it be 85% or 75% etc) This pandemic is going to move in waves from here forward."
33420,"Massive spikes, smashing the unvaccinated (and some unlucky vaccinated folks) to bits."
33421,Then recede.
33422,Then do it again.
33423,All we can do is hope there isn’t a major gap between the vaccine and escaping mutations from now until forever.
33424,Of course!
33425,I’m so sorry about making you worry the first time!
33426,Note to self no responding before I’m fully awake and caffeinated
33427,I said this last time and got downvoted quite a bit.
33428,Prob by Trump dick suckers.
33429,A true WTF moment for me was when Abbott just recently invited Trump to South Texas for that stupid border wall he wants to continue to build.
33430,My wife and I were like….what…the….fuck.
33431,Trump is a nobody why is he even involving him.
33432,Peer pressure.
33433,"If all the other stores are doing it, they may have to."
33434,"I mean, Walmart does predominantly serve a certain demographic that might actually like them being the odd man out of the mask requirement but that’s probably not going to serve them long term."
33435,This comes from a person who grew up on a dirt road where Walmart’s the only big store in the next “town” over
33436,Peer pressure.
33437,"If all the other stores are doing it, they may have to."

33440,I see what you’re saying.
33441,How long can you keep it up though (and feel like your balanced normal self still)?
33442,"I suspect that it wasn’t the masks the wrecked a lot of our mental health here in the US, it was the isolation."
33443,Can we put him out of his misery?
33444,I don’t care if I’m banned I’m tired of this shit.
33445,“Aspects of our COVID exhaustion are due to the reality that many of us are carrying the weight of others’ irresponsibility.
33446,"Many go about their lives, unencumbered with any feeling of social responsibility, then feel justified in their carelessness, at least partially protected by the Herculean efforts of others."
33447,"Not only are we carefully navigating a context foreign to us, sacrificially bearing a collective burden, we have to watch those efforts devalued by those who then pretend their carelessness is justified."
33448,We’re holding a societal umbrella in a downpour; they’re laughing and pretending it’s not raining because they’re not wet.
33449,"It’s exhausting.”
-The Subversive Lens"
33450,Depends on where you live.
33451,The south starts a lot earlier than northern states.
33452,We didn’t start until early September in the PNW.
33453,After re-reading my comment I can see how it may have been interpreted that way.
33454,what I meant was vaccinated people may have a reduced R value for this virus - creating less chances for variants being created.
33455,"Now, you may or may not put much stock in the CDC, but as of 3 days ago "" A growing body of evidence indicates that people fully vaccinated with an mRNA vaccine (Pfizer-BioNTech or Moderna) are less likely than unvaccinated persons to acquire SARS-CoV-2 or to transmit it to others""

https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/science/science-briefs/fully-vaccinated-people.html"
33456,"Kind of sad, I don't recall annual flu shots being controversial."
33457,Yep.
33458,"It’s the thing that puts me on the edge of having compassion because anti-vaxxers are grossly scientifically illiterate, and hatred because their dumbasses create new variants much easier."
33459,shithole governor of a shithole state
33460,Those tight quarters with lots and lots of kids and their snotty faces and grubby hands is going to be an epic breeding ground for COVID variants.
33461,And because kids are typically more able to resist the disease those variants can prove to be even more deadly.
33462,When did you get your second shot and when were you exposed to the cousin?
33463,The entire population will be offered that this year.
33464,There is more than enough Pfizer and Moderna coming in to vax the entire population.
33465,Still doesn’t really have anything to do with Covid but itself.
33466,If the something else like the flu is going around in one area the Covid positivity rate will go down just because more symptomatic people with the flu get tested for Covid.
33467,"Should be able to, but the most important aspect of masks is that everyone wears them, so if someone coughs/sneezes germs are blocked."
33468,Yes we should stay locked away forever.
33469,Finally someone gets it.
33470,"Torino, in the northwest."
33471,"Currently one of the very few ""green"" regions according to the ECDC"
33472,This is a good article with more info than most.
33473,"Record pediatric admissions for July - not just Covid, but Covid or Covid related illnesses add to the stress."
33474,"Half kids in ICU under age 12, no vaccinated kids."
33475,Some kids did not have any underlying health conditions.
33476,Article says things are definitely different with delta and more admissions.
33477,The legislature may undo its law that cities and schools cannot require mask mandates.
33478,And there is a nursing shortage.
33479,Concerning.
33480,This.
33481,It would be interesting to see the both the mortality rate plus the rate if sever outcomes as a result of this.
33482,Then map this against direct and indirect cost/losses.
33483,The picture is literally red
33484,Florida has been at the top of the pro covid anti life policies since the start.
33485,"Never had an actual lockdown /shutdown, immediately banned cities from enforcing any attempt, banned any attempts to mandate masks or vaccines months ago, banned even asking about vaccination status

The local governments are starting to rebel though, seeing as we're about to surpass our 2020 peak hospitalization numbers"
33486,You would think this but school boards and people in education(admin) tend to lean liberal.
33487,Where I live is extremely red but our board is quite liberal.
33488,"Or, you know… everywhere so that we don’t CREATE new hotspots?"
33489,"What's next, banning seat belts?"
33490,Banning sprinklers and fire alarms in large buildings?
33491,Banning restaurant health inspectors?
33492,What a bunch of dunces.
33493,Can you imagine what history will say about this?
33494,"""In the middle of a pandemic, some state governments spent time and resources on banning efforts that reduced the severity of the pandemic."""
33495,Texas is so backwards.
33496,I can't imagine how a state can be pro-power outage and pro-pandemic.
33497,That’s the fear.
33498,It’s called zoonosis
33499,They did and I did.
33500,Very low.
33501,"And if you do get symptoms, they’ll be milder and less dangerous than they would be if you hadn’t gotten vaccinated."
33502,That’s really the bottom line.
33503,"Less sickness, and less danger."
33504,I don’t think the person should have a right to make that choice for themselves.
33505,I’m asking the question because Abott is an idiot.
33506,We “force” things all the time.
33507,"From seatbelts, to vaccinations."
33508,"In some cities in Texas you can’t even walk around barefoot, but somehow putting on masks in where you are dealing the line?"
33509,&gt;would it act like a booster shot?
33510,It would give you some acquired immunity.
33511,Not a good idea to do this intentionally though.
33512,"Yes, everyone will likely be infected at somepoint."
33513,This virus isn’t going away.
33514,"There’s a good chance you’ll never even know you got infected, by the way."
33515,Infection=/= disease.
33516,Yeah me too 🙃 don't know about the vax rate in my area.
33517,Just doing everything I can.

33519,Unknowns =/= misinformation.
33520,"One thing it is clear the general public cannot handle is direction based on our unknowns, but it is the safest option."
33521,"Scientists often communicate from a 'better safe than sorry' perspective, which means that as more insight is gained by ongoing research, those safety recommendations will become obsolete."
33522,"People get all upset and say, ""SEE I TOLD YOU THOSE SAFETY REQUIREMENTS WEREN'T NEEDED!"""
33523,But we *didn't* *know* that when we made the safety standards.
33524,And neither did you!
33525,We simply did our best to avoid the worst possible outcomes.
33526,"""Do no harm"" is most often our credo, even to a fault."
33527,"Now does that mean the CDC (or the WHO, etc.)"
33528,has gotten everything right?
33529,No.
33530,In my opinion mask recommendations never should have changed (many other heathcare professionals thought the same thing: https://www.webmd.com/lung/news/20210527/doctors-nurses-blast-cdcs-mask-guidance-change).
33531,"All the anti-vax, viral mutation in vaccinated individuals mumbo-jumbo goes out the window because if you can't spread it before your body (vaccinated or un-vaccinated) kills it, mutations don't matter anymore."
33532,"But at the end of the day, you'll see most medical institutions recommend the *least risky* practices rather than say, ""we think this is probably ok."" Because the one time they say that and SURPRISE it isn't ""ok"", they killed a bunch of people with their lax recommendations."
33533,"As a former conservative, I now find I can understand today's conservatives through the lens of Frank Wilhoit's quote:

""Conservatism consists of exactly one proposition, to wit: There must be in-groups whom the law protects but does not bind, alongside out-groups whom the law binds but does not protect."""
33534,Don't worry!
33535,Our governor told us that he's not going to do anything about it.
33536,😊
33537,"Historically, pandemics tend to last 2-3 years."
33538,Wikipedia gives a [27 month range](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spanish_flu) for the 1918 flu pandemic.
33539,"The [1889–1890 pandemic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1889%E2%80%931890_pandemic) (probably the most similar because there's reason to believe it was actually caused by a coronavirus, not the flu as originally believed)
&gt; took place from October 1889 to December 1890, with recurrences in March to June 1891, November 1891 to June 1892, winter of 1893–1894, and early 1895."
33540,(Sound familiar?)
33541,"A serious vaccination effort (which means vaccinating *everyone* possible, not just people over 12 or people who feel like it) is the only way to end a pandemic faster than that (other than being good enough at containment it never becomes a pandemic in the first place, but we've long past failed at that)."
33542,And this is the first pandemic where medical technology is good enough that vaccination is even an option.
33543,"&gt;that unvaccinated people are mostly “ Fox News Viewers.” Which isn’t actually reality

It isn't?"
33544,Your link says says 40% of 60% of the population aren't getting vaccinated.
33545,"Sure, smaller populations may be more resistant by percentage (although your link says that's changing rapidly), they still don't outnumber the white people that are refusing."
33546,We also removed all safeguards.
33547,The number of people wearing masks and social distancing is like closing a porthole on the Titanic.
33548,It helps but you still have a 40ft gash with water pouring in.
33549,Even with delta?
33550,"Like if I had the original virus in June 2020, what are my chances of being naturally immune rn"
33551,[removed]
33552,Getting the vaccine and masking up will stop the spread.
33553,"If you noticed, I said that you can still catch the virus in a place where there are many unvaccinated people."
33554,"If you're in a place with high vaccination and masking rates, there won't be much spread, even of the Delta variant."
33555,"What I didn't say, but is also true, is that if you're vaccinated, even if you catch the Delta variant, you are 33 times less likely to end up in the hospital as someone who didn't get vaccinated."
33556,"Once everyone has some immunity from vaccination or infection you put major brakes on how much it can spread, and extremely high levels of protection against serious disease."
33557,Then it's an endemic disease that circulates like the flu and we live with it.
33558,Eradication was always a pipe dream.
33559,[removed]
33560,Wtf is wrong with people??
33561,The science speaks for itself!
33562,Then he’s basically committing negligence homicide and putting all the nurses and doctors in blue towns in serious risk.
33563,They need to stage a walkout.
33564,This is madness.
33565,Breakthroughs were happening *well before Delta.
33566,* It’s not new.
33567,Their job isnt to ‘control a narrative’.
33568,And this wasn’t ‘leaked’.
33569," Restrictions have been lifted in many places in US, and Vax folks could ba carriers, so the kids are getting exposed more now, whether or not the variant is worse."
33570,"At the end of the day, the kids still pay the price."
33571,"The term “Spreadneck” was recently brought to my attention…,"
33572,Maybe read the article.
33573,Me personally?
33574,I'd just rather not go though like wearing the mask means I need to be cautious and alert.
33575,It's not a feeling I want when I'm trying to focus on enjoying something.
33576,"Like yeah people are *kinda* coming back out but a lot of that comes from the feeling that they ""must"" go out, four months down the road is that drive gonna be enough to cover the gap for people like me?"
33577,So glad I left this mess of a state.
33578,There are some beautiful pockets of the state with amazing people that I miss but the governor and so many people living in the state are fine with masses dying so long as they're political team wins.

33595,I'm not sure you want a third jab now when Delta specific vaccine boosters are being developed.
33596,If we can get delta strain specific vaccines the clock will be reset for vaccinated people.
33597,"Check your county on the CDC site, and see how it is ranked for transmission."
33598,"https://www.jnj.com/positive-new-data-for-johnson-johnson-single-shot-covid-19-vaccine-on-activity-against-delta-variant-and-long-lasting-durability-of-response

we good dog"
33599,"For weeks now, I had assumed that the delta variant was already here (in the USA), and, since our daily numbers weren't rising, I interpreted that as evidence that the vaccines offered sufficient protection against the delta variant."
33600,"I had assumed that the delta variant had spread rapidly throughout India because their entire population is mostly unvaccinated; and as for the UK, I thought it was spreading because most of their population had still only received one dose of a two-dose vaccine."
33601,It is only during the past week or so that I have seen a sudden increase in cases within highly vaccinated counties.
33602,"So, from my perspective at least, it doesn't seem like the CDC has lagged too far behind in terms of their most recent change in guidance."
33603,"However, I could be wrong... it is possible that they have taken a ""wait-and-see"" approach, despite being aware of alarming evidence."
33604,"I also imagine that there is a strategy about publicly modifying their guidance (for instance, I imagine that many, many people would not have taken a change in guidance as seriously while the daily numbers were still very low; now that the numbers are suddenly increasing, perhaps their messaging would be all the more believable)."
33605,"Who really knows, though?"
33606,I really do wonder what the point of that is.
33607,They're prohibiting local governments from imposing public health measures to protect their citizens??
33608,"That makes zero sense, but a lot in the last 18 months has made sense."
33609,"Don't worry, one in twenty children in Arkansas don't even have insurance."
33610,Holy caps lock
33611,I don't think this is going to change anyone's opinion unfortunately.
33612,[removed]
33613,Is this being challenged in the courts?
33614,"I can’t imagine that it would stand, given the concept of freedom of association."
33615,"I know that that is not necessarily in the constitution, but generally only protected classes fall in this category."
33616,I think you have a hard time making the argument that being vaccinated as a medical condition that requires a reasonable accommodation.
33617,"And, a reasonable accommodation would be for the shop or to give the store their order and their credit card information and conduct all their business at a distance with outside pickup."
33618,And a restaurant can give you takeout.
33619,And also given that almost all stores would accommodate a non-vaccinated person in someway without letting them in the store.
33620,"That depends, Universal Orlando?"
33621,Maybe but it is a bit iffy.
33622,I knew Disney would but had my doubts on Universal.

33676,"""Mask up"" psychology worked?"
33677,"I’m not an anti vaxer, but at this point I’m fully loosing hope in the vaccines we have."
33678,A close person last week went to an event where only vaccinated people were allowed.
33679,There were 9 persons in total.
33680,One person had COVID and so far it’s been confirmed that 6 people in the event got it.
33681,The other 3 haven’t been tested.
33682,"Again, all vaccinated and over half of them got the virus."
33683,This person met with me early this week.
33684,I got COVID and now my wife also has it.
33685,We’re both vaccinated.
33686,I’m tired of this.
33687,"I can barely afford to live in Texas, where my neighbors and leaders could not give shit one about my health and safety."
33688,Sure wish I could afford to live somewhere like NY or CA.
33689,My entire family is vaccinated but two are still very vulnerable.
33690,Take your snarky comments elsewhere.
33691,"Just to have equal representation/information, TX is 24th in the nation in deaths per million."
33692,Hardly a massacre.
33693,"And really, this isnt going to have much effect, even with so called mandates, a large number of the population would ignore them."
33694,This is mostly just posturing by the governor.
33695,"It's almost comical seeing these politicians, who really knows better, rush to kill off their voters."
33696,Apologies!!!
33697,You are absolutely correct and I was just too quick to judge.
33698,Florida probably just needs to stay the course and focus on expanding and maintaining healthcare capacity.
33699,The people who most need to follow a mask mandate aren’t going to follow one.
33700,"A lockdown can buy time, but time for what?"
33701,It isn’t like unvaccinated Floridians are flocking to get vaxxed and we just need to buy a few weeks time for immunity to kick in.
33702,Any mitigation measures now are just kicking the inevitable can a few weeks down the road.
33703,Cool man - stay safe and enjoy life to the fullest extent that it is safely possible to do so!
33704,"If we had Universal Basic Income could just take that away, make vaccinations a prerequisite."
33705,Really there's a bunch of stuff you could just tie to that system to make people do things so they get free basic living money.
33706,Can he be held liable for ensuing deaths and long term covid effects?
33707,Still better than what CDC does.
33708,Why did CDC remove mask mandate in May so confidently?
33709,"😡

You can’t just look at a graph and make those decisions."
33710,Take sociology into account too 🤬
33711,[removed]
33712,Yep.
33713,I have a *12 year old* daughter that is fully vaccinated.
33714,  No worries.
33715,I see how the deleted comment played into your conclusions.
33716,I’m sorry about your grandpa.
33717,"It’s your decision whether you want to go, I’m sure nobody would fault you if the answer is no with the news about Delta the past 2-3 weeks."
33718,"I’d recommend that if you do decide to go, wear a mask and get tested when you get home."
33719,[removed]
33720,Oppress me harder daddy!
33721,That was against the early variants.
33722,"The whole presentation is about the CDC struggling with messaging to communicate that ""just because you can transmit it while vaccinated doesn't mean the vaccine is pointless"" -- and also how to communicate that the vaccinated making up a higher % of hospitalized cases is a good thing."
33723,Ideally it would be 100% of all cases because there is no unvaccinated population.
33724,How does he expect to stay in office if none of his voters are alive?
33725,Good thing this whole charade is illegal.
33726,"It would be like mandating that stores can't have ""no shirt, no shoes, no service"" policies."
33727,I'll take my downvotes but just cancel Broadway shows until this thing gets under control.
33728,Neither vaccinations or masks are 100%.
33729,Continuing to have public gatherings/events is sending a mixed message.
33730,It sounds like they absolutely deserve that shame.
33731,Not sure how you are defending their actions considering the outcome.

33734,"In previous plagues people did ""give up."""
33735,"My risk is now considerably low, I am willing to accept that risk to get on with life because eradication at this point does not seem viable and no other path forward has been proposed."

33756,The elderly are heavily vaccinated.
33757,I’m also of the opinion that Gottlieb is close to right on his assumption.
33758,I also think with Delta being R8 or around chickenpox level infectious it is infecting a huge amount of people and is LESS severe than original strains.
33759,This remains to be seen but until we have an idea of how many are actually getting infected compared to those hospitalized it will be hard to tell.
33760,If I’m fact Delta is this infectious it will burn through nearly our entire population very quickly.
33761,This could be a good thing in the end if indeed it is much less severe.
33762,"I mean I get that, but adults do have to sleep and this really isn’t a solution because you cannot possibly pack in sleep and truly educating your kid by just “abandoning time to yourself.”

33792,The cause of hospitalization is not known.
33793,&gt; Post-vaccination infection hospitalization defined as a post-vaccination case having had a hospital admit date on the same day or after the first positive COVID test date; hospitalizations have not been verified to be COVID-associated.
33794,Now obviously it *may* be that all of these people were in fact hospitalized because of COVID.
33795,It could also be the case that none of them were hospitalized because of COVID.

34316,"Prior to delta, I feel like I do understand a sort of rationale for why they did this."
34317,"At the time, I really, \*really\* didn't like that they weren't distinguishing positive cases among vaccinated individuals from unvaccinated individuals, but, in retrospect, I can see how it makes sense."
34318,"I know that on paper, the stated reasoning is that they did not want to waste resources keeping track of the ""positive"" cases who would generally not go on to develop any symptoms; since none of the vaccines confer sterilizing immunity, it was a given that many (perhaps most) vaccinated individuals would be exposed to the virus, accumulate viral mRNA in their bodies, but would never become ""infected"" in the sense that that they would ever develop symptomatic disease."
34319,"Even besides this point, though, I feel like there was possibly a PR move at play, which, to me, does feel warranted, even if it was prioritizing a kind of political strategy over truth."
34320,"First and foremost, tabulating so-called ""breakthrough cases"" among perfectly healthy vaccinated people would make the vaccines appear to be much less efficacious than they actually are, and this would not only be incorrect, but also very dangerous, for obvious reasons."
34321,"Secondly, it would have perhaps encouraged fully vaccinated people to unnecessarily self-isolate, needlessly prolonging all the economic pain that's been wrought by this virus."
34322,"I certainly don't believe that people should be encouraged to endanger themselves and their communities just to participate in the economy, but the vaccines did actually confer the near-perfect level of protection that we were told from the alpha and beta variants, as well as from the original virus."
34323,"Up until quite recently, it was unclear how quickly delta might spread among the fully vaccinated; we were able to see how it spread among unvaccinated and partially vaccinated populations, but not among communities where a majority of people are fully vaccinated."
34324,"This ""wait-and-see"" approach might appear irresponsible, short-sighted and maybe even inhumane in retrospect, but, the truth is that we would never know how bad it can get, until things start getting bad."
34325,"If delta was as effectively neutralized by the vaccines as all the other variants of concern, then nobody would be feeling betrayed by the CDC's decision to not keep track of infections among vaccinated people, or their guidance about dropping all mask mandates for vaccinated people."
34326,"Unfortunately, we now know that the delta variant does spread among fully vaccinated individuals, at least often enough to warrant reintroducing measures like masking and limiting your time spent indoors or among crowds."
34327,"I guess all I'm trying to say is, I do think that they tried to advise us based on the information that they had at the time, and in a manner that was genuinely intended to be in the public's overall best interest."
34328,"Even if their might have been a political / PR component to it, at the expense of truth."
34329,Probably there is always a sort of balancing act like that when it comes to any kind of country-wide public health messaging.
34330,"(Of course, this all my own personal speculation, and I am not making any actual claims about the CDC's intentions in all this)."

34428,&gt; what is long covid?
34429,&gt; what do you mean getting people sick fucks up the economy?
34430,&gt;Very low potential.
34431,What is this claim based on?
34432,It is only during the past 2 weeks or so that we have become increasingly aware how easily delta is spreading among the fully vaccinated.
34433,It takes 1-2 months for long-haul symptoms to develop.
34434,"Even then, it would take even longer to identify and tabulate statistics to account for people who are fully vaccinated and are confirmed to have long-term complications."
34435,"I do agree that the probability for vaccinated people of developing long-covid was found to be very small for the original virus, as well as the alpha and beta variants."
34436,"But, for the delta variant, I do not believe we have any real data on that, yet."
34437,"What we do have, though, is a \*ton\* of anecdotal reports of fully vaccinated people losing their sense of taste/smell, and developing chronic fatigue and brain fog."
34438,All evidence of neurological complications typical of long-covid.
34439,That is indeed what the CDC is saying.
34440,"But what is being reported is something along the lines of:

"" There is no advantage to vaccination in  terms of transmission""

That is not what the CDC is saying, but it is incredibly powerful negative propaganda."
34441,carpe diem.

34452,Let’s let it rip while we fine tune vaccines/boosters so we can learn to live with this thing.
34453,The anti-vax crowd is just as pathetic as the mask forever crowd.
34454,This IS worrying however I think we do need to be honest with ourselves and move our own goalposts back to where they were.
34455,This time last year the expectation was not that we would have a vaccine that prevented transmission - we were hoping for a vaccine that saved lives and eliminated the hospital surges.
34456,"When the real world data early this year started coming out, we were pleasantly surprised that we got that AND that vaccinated people were not really transmitting the virus to each other."
34457,That was amazing.
34458,So what do we have?
34459,"Right now we have strong vaccines that go a long way towards reducing mortality and hospitalizations, just as we wished."
34460,"Now, we need to figure out how to work together again to reduce spread and increase vaccination rates so we can avoid these huge surges and be on our way to updated boosters and low risk of infection."
34461,There has not been something comparable.
34462,"Segregation before was based on something that cannot be helped- race, and/or something that doesn't hurt other people/ isnt contagious- religion."
34463,This is both something that CAN be helped and something that DOES hurt other people.

34465,Yeah.
34466,You probably need to plan your next vacay.
34467,This is actually a massively important demographics stat they need to check into.
34468,I'm not in the LGBTQ community but I'm going to assume there was a lot of close contact between very liberal very vaccinated individuals and that many of the unvaccinated cases may have been workstaff at hotels/bars/restaurants who's contact was NOT as close?
34469,What a fascinating cases study this is!
34470,"&gt; I think the issue is that a lot of them were vaccinated right before, when the single shot vaccine takes 4-6 weeks to reach efficacy."
34471,I doubt it.
34472,"""Proof of vaccination"" with the EU corona certificate generally means ""at least 2 weeks have passed since your second shot""."
34473,Is it safe to not wear a mask if everyone in the area is fully vaccinated?
34474,"My school is requiring everyone to submit proof that they’re fully vaccinated before they can be on campus and masks are no longer required, but I’m not sure if I should be wearing one just in case or if I’m safe since we’ll all be vaccinated."
34475,As someone who believes the government should not be able to force you to do anything against your will.
34476,This is just dumb.

34520,To what end though?
34521,In 2020 we took precautions to limit hospital capacity and wait for the vaccine.
34522,The vaccine is now freely available and people are refusing to get it.
34523,"So from my perspective when I now hear ""you need to mask up, do this, whatever to limit the spread"" my thinking is just like yours."

34525,"Wear a mask, stay indoors, and just hope it goes away?"

34536,"If 1,000,000 per day were being infected right now, and considering the way infections can increase exponentially, some form of ""herd immunity"" would quickly result."
34537,"After all, around 50% of the total US population is fully vaccinated with another 7% with at least one dose."
34538,Leaving around 140 million unvaccinated (but with some portion of that population with some antibodies from previous infection).

34551,7/72=10 so 7% gives 10 periods doubling time.

34554,Varicella has an estimated [R0 around 10-12 by most common estimates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_reproduction_number).
34555,That is really high.
34556,The theoretical herd immunity formula = 1 - 1 / R0 would then imply a required herd immunity level of 1 - 1/10 = 90%.
34557,The CDC's [own internal presentation suggests Pfizer 2-dose is only 64-87% effective against delta variant infection](https://www.washingtonpost.com/context/cdc-breakthrough-infections/94390e3a-5e45-44a5-ac40-2744e4e25f2e/?_=1).
34558,"So you see the problem here - even if you vaccinate 100% of the population, at 87% efficacy, you're not quite reaching herd immunity for delta variant."

34616,"That's a misleading interpretation of the data, though."
34617,The cause of hospitalization is not indicated.
34618,&gt; Post-vaccination infection hospitalization defined as a post-vaccination case having had a hospital admit date on the same day or after the first positive COVID test date; hospitalizations have not been verified to be COVID-associated.
34619,No not really.
34620,You’re already paying so much that that wouldn’t make it worth it for me.
34621,A movie I really wanted to see I probably would but there aren’t many coming out.
34622,A concert maybe
34623,So dumb
34624,I lived in Miami last year.
34625,It was ridiculous to hear how some states handled everything while looking around and seeing the lack of effort taking place in Florida.
34626,"Now I'm in Oklahoma, which is slightly better exclusively due to being surrounded by less people."
34627,I feel like I've been in quarantine since March 2020 lol
34628,[removed]
34629,That's what I took away from it.
34630,Masks until most everyone is vaccinated...maybe even a booster is needed.
34631,I'm seeing something potentially concerning in L.A. County's data and could use some reassurance.

""Post-vaccination Infections Overall""

https://i.imgur.com/WChWuBi.jpg

All hospitalizations  (cribbed from LACDH's Twitter): 
7/22 - 645   
7/29 - 918   

An increase of 273 for the week."
34633,"If 123, nearly half, of those new hospitalizations are vaccinated, that doesn't seem ""rare."""
34634,"Is this as worrisome as it seems on the surface and if not, why not?"
34635,What am I missing?
34636,"PROVO, Utah — As Mindy Greene spent another day in the Covid intensive care unit, listening to the whirring machines that now breathed for her 42-year-old husband, Russ, she opened her phone and tapped out a message."
34637,"“We did not get the vaccine,” she wrote on Facebook."
34638,“I read all kinds of things about the vaccine and it scared me.
34639,"So I made the decision and prayed about it and got the impression that we would be ok.”

They were not."
34640,"Her husband, the father to their four children, was now hovering between life and death, tentacles of tubes spilling from his body."
34641,The patient in the room next to her husband’s had died hours earlier.
34642,"That day, July 13, Ms. Greene decided to add her voice to an unlikely group of people speaking out in the polarized national debate over vaccination: The remorseful."
34643,"“If I had the information I have today we would have gotten vaccinated,” Ms. Greene wrote."
34644,"Come what may, she hit “send.” Amid a resurgence of coronavirus infections and deaths, some people who once rejected the vaccine or simply waited too long are now grappling with the consequences, often in raw, public ways."
34645,"A number are speaking from hospital beds, at funerals and in obituaries about their regrets, about the pain of enduring the virus and watching unvaccinated family members die gasping for breath."
34646,"“I have such incredible guilt,” Ms. Greene said one morning as she sat in the fourth-floor lobby outside the I.C.U."
34647,"at Utah Valley Hospital in Provo, which looks out to the mountains where her family once went hiking and four-wheeling."
34648,“I blame myself still.
34649,"Every day.”
The recent surge of infections and hospitalizations among unvaccinated people has brought the grim realities of Covid-19 crashing home for many who thought they had skirted the pandemic."
34650,"But now, with anger and fatigue piled up on all sides, the question is whether their stories can actually change any minds."
34651,"Some people hospitalized with the virus still vow not to get vaccinated, and surveys suggest that the majority of unvaccinated Americans are not budging."
34652,Doctors in Covid units say some patients still refuse to believe they are infected with anything beyond the flu.
34653,“We have people in the I.C.U.
34654,"with Covid who are denying they have Covid,” said Dr. Matthew Sperry, a pulmonary critical care physician who has been treating Mr. Greene."
34655,"“It doesn’t matter what we say.”

Covid hospitalizations in Utah have risen 35 percent over the past two weeks, and Dr. Sperry said intensive care units across the 24-hospital system where he works are 98 percent full."
34656,"Still, some hospitals swamped with patients in largely conservative, unvaccinated swaths of the country have begun to recruit Covid survivors as public health messengers of last resort."
34657,"The hope is that onetime skeptics might just persuade others who dismissed vaccination campaigns led by President Biden, Dr. Anthony Fauci and armies of local doctors and health workers."
34658,"Theirs are Scared Straight stories for a pandemic that has thrived on misinformation, fear and hardened partisan divisions over whether or not to get vaccinated."
34659,"“People are creating news from their hospital beds, from the wards,” said Rebecca Weintraub, an assistant professor of global health and social medicine at Harvard Medical School."
34660,“It’s the accessibility of the message: ‘I didn’t protect my own family.
34661,"Let me help you protect yours.’”
In Springfield, Mo., where coronavirus cases spiked this summer, Russell Taylor sat in a hospital gown, an oxygen cannula draped across his face, to offer a pro-vaccine testimonial in a hospital video."
34662,"“I don’t see how I could not get it now,” he said."
34663,A Texas man who underwent a double-lung transplant after contracting the virus made a plea on local television for others to get vaccinated.
34664,"And in a shaking voice, a hospital-clinic administrator in rural Utah described how she had been pummeled by double pneumonia and sepsis after choosing not to get vaccinated."
34665,"The woman, Stormy, said it had taken weeks to summon the nerve to speak out in a video posted by her local health department."
34666,She only did so using her first name because she worried that Covid deniers would say she was making it all up.
34667,"“I absolutely was fearful of the negative aspects that could come from it,” she said in an interview this week."
34668,"“I was part of a problem that I was trying to avoid.”

Some people who were quick to embrace the vaccine are now choosing to speak out about family members who did not."
34669,"It was a role Kimberle Jones never wanted, but one she embraced after her daughter, Erica Thompson, 37, a mother from St. Louis, died on July 4, nearly three months after she had what she thought was a bad asthma attack."
34670,"I want to be a voice for her,” said Ms. Jones, who got vaccinated as soon as she was able to."
34671,"“I really think my daughter would want me to say, ‘Go get vaccinated.’”

It was advice Ms. Thompson — like some 39 percent of American adults — did not heed."
34672,"Ms. Thompson had been leery of how quickly the Moderna and Pfizer vaccines had rolled out — the culmination of decades of scientific research, according to her mother."
34673,"She also believed the government-run campaign was a plot against Black people like her, her mother said."
34674,"Vaccination rates for Black and Hispanic Americans lag behind the white population, a gap that researchers attribute to distrust rooted in a history of medical discrimination and a lack of access and outreach."
34675,"After scraping by making $10 an hour at call-center jobs, Ms. Thompson had recently found a dream job doing medical coding."
34676,She went to the hospital coughing and struggling to breathe in mid-May and was on a ventilator within days.
34677,Ms. Jones said she sang “Beat It” as her daughter was sedated and promised to be there when she woke.
34678,"“Her last words to me were, ‘Mama I can’t breathe,’” Ms. Jones said."
34679,[...]
34680,"Just came off doing that for about 5 years, and fuck it's hard"
34681,Thanks for doing the math and checking for me.
34682,I knew it wasn't good.
34683,And the numbers of vaccinated breakthroughs themselves aren't good because I know 10 breakthrough cases myself in the past 2 weeks.
34684,"If you're worried, source yourself some N95 masks and read up on how to properly wear them."
34685,N95 is like your own personal herd immunity.
34686,It’s always possible that those people will also make a recovery eventually.
34687,It hasn’t been long enough to tell for sure.
34688,Makes me appreciate my low hundreds of cases in my state.
34689,"I'm tracing for risk to my hospital, I've had over 100 cases to evaluate this week, which is more than double my previous worst week."
34690,"My team rotates through by week, and the previous 2 weeks have also been pretty awful."
34691,"It's the lifting of restrictions and July 4 holiday, and tourists."
34692,State said 40-50% of new cases are Delta variant.
34693,Same where I work
34694,I agree but I think that people are really skating over the problem of getting the vaccine approved for kids.
34695,We are talking about something that does not have a high mortality for kids or high risk of hospitalization.
34696,This changes the vaccine calculus.
34697,"For elderly adults, COVID is so dangerous that you can accept some vaccine issues because the cost benefit is still so high."
34698,I am not saying there are issues with the vaccine but you have to be VERY SURE.
34699,That involves more testing and expanded trials.
34700,It’s still up in the air whether it is ethical to administer vaccines to kids that are neutral in cost benefit but provide population wide benefits.
34701,One of the issues I am referring to is myocarditis that was found in teens.
34702,"&gt; Now, it says even fully vaccinated people can sometimes catch the virus and if they catch the Delta variant, *they are just as likely to infect someone else as an unvaccinated person would be."
34703,* It advised everyone in areas of high or sustained virus transmission to wear masks when around others.
34704,"I think you have that name wrong...

https://twitter.com/chise"
34705,It actually is according to some of the Texans I have spoken with.
34706,"Someone on my team contracted COVID last year, spread through their entire family, so all 5 were down and out for the count for a week or two."
34707,"After that they bounced back, the mindset was ""it wasn't so bad"", so now they have no incentive to get vaccinated or wear masks."
34708,"Please correct me if I'm wrong, but isn't their official philosophy about allowing local governments to make local decisions?"
34709,"Or AZ, which passed HB 2770, which exempts all businesses from any mask mandates that may be enacted by local jurisdictions."

34734,Honestly the virus could easily mutate to effect children under 12 more since they aren't vaccinated and masking will be sparse in schools.

34759,That's been a pretty similar pattern throughout the world.
34760,"Waves don't come in and infect everyone and then stop when there's herd immunity, even in places with minimal restrictions."
34761,"Waves come in, hit hard and then decline (though India seems to be ticking up again) but always leave a lot of susceptible people for the next wave."
34762,"It may be accelerated with Delta because it spreads so easily that it runs out of targets quicker (plus with a lot of vaccinated people, there's more resistance to it)."
34763,But we don't really know exactly why waves happen the way they do.
34764,Well code black means something different in each system.
34765,"I'm assuming it's ""mass casualty"" which reallocates resources (staff supply chain work flow etc) to address an acute problem."
