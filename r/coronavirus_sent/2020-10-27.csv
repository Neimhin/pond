185,But Scott AtlAss said herd immunity would work!
186,Sorry but that was clearly not about covid 19.
187,Those contaminates just uses up the available chlorine slightly faster.

189,"My old pool was always a fight when we had a bunch of rain washing dirt and algae from the screen roof into it, before I switched it over to salt water."

242,It will also take weeks and months to distribute it and give it to everyone.
243,"Depending on which vaccine it ends up being you may need a 2nd booster shot after 30 days, which means you’d have to continue wearing a mask and socially distancing for 30 days until you can get the 2nd shot."

255,What our local districts did was offer a mix of mainly hybrid or all remote.
256,"If you selected all remote, you were set up with special teachers that would be all remote."
257,The remaining kids were split into groups for hybrid.
258,When you are at school you do lessons and get your work for the following day(s).
259,The in school models could somewhat float with numbers.
260,A couple were all remote and the rest went hybrid.
261,I think hybrid has been working decently well for the older kids (7-12).

Not necessarily true."
312,"You can dramatically lower the infection rates in the first wave, so the first peak passes."
313,But when the second wave comes there's another peak.
314,I think it riles people up because there hasn't been a federal response.
315,So as a country we can't be on a third wave because it's never really gone back to a much lower level.
316,Calling it the first wave still acknowledges the failures.
317,Yep seeing 0 positive from 20k tests is brilliant.
318,Let's hope people keep getting tested.

342,"We can blame and that's fair, but vaccine approvals coming in another month then distribution and time to just get our shots and kill this pandemic."
343,PS- Canada is at about 240 deaths per million.
344,Better than most of western europe (except Germany) at 500-600+.
345,I think US is 600 but with 330 million population its going to be big numbers.
346,On top of what /u/skadsh said they also delayed the expected we're easing restrictions announcement by 2 (maybe only 1) days while they waited for the results of a testing blitz in a part of metro Melbourne that had seen more cases than they were comfortable with.
347,When those results all came back negative the announcement went ahead.
348,So lack of testing is not of particular concern here.
349,It's not arrogance it is about saving lives.
350,Period.
351,The advantage of human intelligence is that you can learn from others.
352,Also you can do maths and make predictions.

371,So it does.
372,Thanks.
373,"Their ""Active Cases in the United States"" graph is especially what I was looking for."
374,Shows the active number of infected has never really dropped so much as plateaued at certain points.
375,http://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/
376,"I would expect the situation is not very much unlike other large, heavily populated nations -- certain regions have experienced significant outbreaks which then slowed down as the environment for the virus became less target-rich... while other regions have yet to be hit and will be the target for future surges in cases."
377,This man works hardest.
378,I mean he came up with “wash your hands” AND “wear a mask” all on his own and has been working hard on that for over 6 months.
379,I heard he only sleeps few hours a day.
380,I'm in Canada.
381,Our cases in Alberta were dropping.
382,Then the mask mandate came and cases climbed like crazy.
383,"Logically, it does not make sense."
384,Further evidence that you should try to unionize your workplace if you can!!
385,They'll protect you when your boss won't.
386,"In some places in NYC at the height, ICU nurses who would normally be caring for 1-2 patients per shift were desperately trying to care for ten."
387,Lack of medical personnel is one of the reasons the death rate spikes at a certain point.
388,"And every time you try and get out of the pool, you get pushed back in by a couple of Mounties in hazmat suits muttering apologies."
389,!remind me 2 weeks
390,Coronavirus seems to be seasonal as we can see in Europe.
391,Our flu season is now over except the north and Tamil Nadu with the end of the monsoon.
392,only recently did Google remove 'do no evil' from their code of conduct.
393,Star?
394,For sure.
395,"My point was just that we're all dealing with a lot more inconvenience and suffering due to covid now than we ever needed to, but we've been fucking it up since the start."

399,"Lol just was downvoted to hell for saying this, morons"
400,Do you believe mass graves are a necessity?
401,Who do you think should be buried in those mass graves?
402,Where did you get this from?
403,I think if you look at case numbers it cannot go negative.
404,But if you look at infection rate then there have been times it has had a negative slope.
405,"Like anything, we can fudge to tell us what we want.just a thought."
406,We have no way of knowing how long immunity lasts.
407,There’s been scientifically confirmed cases of reinfection in some rare cases.
408,At the end of the day though you should defer to medical advice only from a qualified physician.

410,That’s not unsurprising.
411,It’s a pandemic what do you expect.
412,Some places are doing better some worse.
413,It will get better.
414,Same across the country really...
415,"Well, according to the flawed models 90k people were supposed to die in Sweden if they implemented their stated strategy...they did and only 6k people died."
416,People have been spitting out BS worst case scenarios about Covid since March...the reddit masses just move on to the next dire proclamation without once reconsidering their positions after being wrong so many times.
417,I have looked at the data (not what ifs and BS projections) and I don't lose any sleep over Covid.
418,"99.99% of the damage has been due to our overreaction - trillions of dollars of debt which will need to be paid back by reducing future healthcare, education, and old age pension benefits, hundreds of millions thrown into poverty, massive increase in  suicidal intentions, millions of children losing a year of school, and hundreds of millions out of jobs...for a virus who on average kills people in their mid 80s with multiple comorbidities."
419,It is like someone is saving me from a slight tap in the face by shooting me in the back of the head.
420,The cure is 1000X worse than the disease.

429,"But say that people need to take a drug test to get unemployment, and everyone losers their frikin' minds."

431,Do you think things will be a little more expensive after this?
432,"Airlines are going to want to make money, places haven’t been able to have tourism."
433,"Bands haven’t had shows, venues haven’t had fan."
434,I feel it’s a ripe recipe for things to even be 5-10% more expensive than they should be
435,Not the people that I've been seeing.
436,"We were willing to sacrifice 400,000 young males to protect freedom in Europe and Japan during WW2."
437,"So yeah, I'm okay with overweight boomers having skin in the game in order to protect freedom here in America."
438,"thank you, very comprehensive"
439,"The flu is actually a big problem every year, especially for hospitals."
440,"It hits younger kids very hard, as well."
441,"We have better ways of treating the flu, and it may not be as big a problem as covid, but it remains a problem."
442,"This year in particular, more workplaces are requiring the flu vaccine in acknowledgement that our hospitals cannot handle a normal flu season with covid."
443,That's the third part of the 1st wave.
444,"Yeah it's hard to undertand, for me too."
445,"I read some things about it, after the 3rd part, cases SHOULD start to go down."
446,And then the second wave will come.
447,But to know we need to wait I guess

453,Give me a few more months of quarantine drinking alone at home and we’ll see...
454,"Look, I know this is too difficult for you to understand, but death rate is only one dimension."
455,The goal has always been to prevent overwhelming the hospitals.
456,"Now it's actually happening in different parts of the country, and others are well along their way."
457,"But, dumbasses like you will *only* look at one statistic because you heard it on fox news one time."
458,Not if precautions are being enforced.
459,My gym has been opened for two months.
460,"Everyone wears a mask at all times, and I rarely get within 10 feet of someone."
461,There haven't been any issues.
462,It also puts the log in analogy.
463,I don’t live in your country but I’m also a teacher.
464,It’s impossible for a teacher to do more than one method brilliantly.
465,Or would you rather they do a half-arsed job of the multiple options??
466,I don’t need a lecture on sacrifice or social cohesion.
467,"My country sacrificed, stuck together and we made it through and now have no restrictions to activity."
468,Or virus freely circulating.
469,People often shit on Redditors for being armchair warriors...
470,But how can you try harder to enlighten people?
471,"Ive pressured my dad to vote Democratic, but he's still in the ""both parties are same"" camp."
472,In my neighborhood?
473,"I live in an orthodox Jewish neighborhood in NYC; just yesterday there was a caravan of ""Jews for Trump"" honking down my block for 15 minutes."
474,I won't convince these people of anything.
475,"If I go to other areas around me, 95% are already voting against Trump."
476,To be able to sway public opinion you need to live in some mythical place with tons of undecideds who are willing to talk.
477,Obvious to some people.
478,Others are totally clueless.
479,Exactly.
480,Especially when no one else is learning algebra thus year.
481,"[Vietnam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic_in_Vietnam), [Taiwan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic_in_Taiwan) and [South Korea](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic_in_South_Korea) are sure doing good."
482,Maybe we should listen to them.
483,"It's to limit social interactions outside of work but doesn't negate interactions in an office, at uni, on public transport, etc."
484,"I think its just a stupid ,last minute thing by our health pm"

487,"That all sounds eerily similar to the ongoing situation here in Czech Republic, minus involvement of the Catholic Church."
488,[removed]
489,Thank god they didnt.
490,I highly doubt it's more aggressive.
491,In all likelihood younger people (can we agree up to age of 50?)
492,were the driver of the second wave hence why there will be more young deaths at the beginning.
493,Meaning you are not more at risk of dying if you contract covid then a few months ago (provided care can be given if required).
494,We do?
495,Act 2 of the shit show starting now.
496,Logistics of this are going to be challenging to say the least.
497,Thanks for the perspective.
498,"I have a hard time understanding why people would react this way, but then I don't know anyone who didn't treat this thing like an adult."
499,What a weird comment.
500,"I clarified it was my experience, just like the OPs response was a personal experience."
501,Am I supposed to be in touch with business owners whose businesses failed?
502,"I'm not representing business owners of Melbourne, I'm just some guy on Reddit who is telling my experience of the lockdown."
503,"I know people who lost their jobs, my company revenue is down 50% and I am on severe pay cuts, I know people in high school through to people in aged care, all generally sharing the sentiment, it wasn't too bad."
504,"Some had it harder than others, I never denied that."
505,Just because some businesses failed doesn't invalidate my feelings or others.
506,Look at the number of business that have failed in the US without a lockdown.
507,There is no right answer.
508,"If we didn't lockdown, we would have people on the other side  mourning the loss of their parents and people furious that people died."
509,"As an aside, suicides in Melbourne have not increased compared to last year."
510,Italy has a significant communist party.
511,So how much of this is Russian agitation?
512,"&gt; Flying is bad, bad idea no matter what."
513,I definitely agree with that
514,"It's getting cold already, they just had some snow, and the fires have created poor air quality."
515,Basically already reason to stay at home.
516,"But an order is just that, an order on paper."
517,"Yeah, your ego."
518,Over a million people have died to this.
519,Show some compassion for those lost and those who are going to be lost.
520,Musicians are not high on the totem pole for this.
521,It’s nice a vaccine will be out but don’t you ever forget what’s important during something serious

598,"It’s not just about the healthcare system but also the reaction of the state, country and the state of the social welfare system."
599,My own country (Australia) locked down pretty quickly at the start.
600,Western Australia and Queensland locked their borders down so fast and hard to every other state and international and when they realised this was serious.
601,Then the Northern Territory and Tasmania and South Australia followed soon after.
602,"The difference is they had state leaders who basically said F* this, no, and decisively despite opposition just slammed the borders shut and even now are playing hardball and refusing to open despite the entire country having nearly completely beaten covid - or being cautious, because they just aren’t willing to risk it."
603,Contact tracing in those states was pretty good.
604,"They went into various stages of lockdown at the start, Western Australia put homeless people into the hotels to get them off the streets when the hotels had to go into lockdown and had no customers."
605,The government paid the hotels to house them so the hotels wouldn’t go bust and so people who were vulnerable were safe.
606,Canberra was good with contact tracing and was able to avoid much lockdown or border closing.
607,In NSW and Victoria (Sydney and Melbourne) they didn’t close the borders.
608,In NSW it nearly got out of control - F* up with contact tracing and the cruises docking - and in Victoria it got out of hand because contact tracing went off the rails.
609,Victoria nearly became like the rest of the world.
610,They were out of control and climbing as fast as everywhere else.
611,"The difference here being that, the rest of the country was doing okay and the having the support of other states behind them and basically that one last push to get over the line for a covid safe country they went to the extreme."
612,They went into complete police lockdown.
613,Curfew.
614,Regional and city and suburb style border closures.
615,"You could only be out of your home for a certain period of time, for certain reasons."
616,The majority of businesses had to close.
617,"If you didn’t adhere to these rules, the police would fine you and if you resisted, they’d arrest you."
618,It was that simple.
619,But In saying all that - they didn’t leave people with nothing.
620,"Our government has been paying $1100 as a couple each every two weeks (so a two person family would get $2200 every fortnight plus you could take up to $20,000 out of your retirement fund that every working Australian has - employers pay 9%-11% extra as part of your contract into a super fund that you access for emergencies or when you turn 60.)"
621,"They frozen rental evictions, they gave relief to the banks and utility companies so that they could pass those on to the homeowners and then down to the renters - you could get out of leases easier, you could negotiate a temporary rent decrease or a mortgage stop."
622,They had a scheme where businesses would be paid $1500 a fortnight per employee that they kept employeed too.
623,"The goal of this, was so that for example Target or Kmart could just close their doors and not go bankrupt but keep paying employees - to stay at home."
624,"Then when it opened again, they hadn’t lost employees, it was to save jobs and big corporations."
625,They gave bailout funds to industries that needed it.
626,To stop them collapsing.
627,A huge lockdown is a massive pain in the ass.
628,"Big companies still pay massive rents to the people who rent out the store space, amusement parks and zoos still have bills to pay and animals to feed."
629,But the point of all this - is that when Victoria went into total lockdown - it lasted three months and was hell on earth for them but at the end of it what do they have to show for the pain?
630,Lockdown just eased for them.
631,They are at zero cases a day.
632,From 400-700 and climbing.... to zero new.
633,Low mortality.
634,They did it.
635,The whole country is at low cases now.
636,Most are either under control or are from people returning home from overseas at which point they are forcefully quarantined in hotels for two weeks.
637,Is it harsh?
638,Yeah.
639,Very.
640,But we got paid to stay at home and not everybody will agree with the government obviously but they didn’t totally leave us with nothing.
641,"It is worth it to be in a country where I feel safe, but bittersweet and terrifying to know my friends around the world and the world in general is suffering and wishing they could have the same."
642,"I'm also okay with that, just please don't tank until after I get my dividends in December"
643,FFP2s and FFP3 are ideal for 8 hours.
644,I personally use mine for 16 hours in two separate intervals.
645,I’ve been using shitty offbrand ones (because it’s impossible to get Drager/3M ones in my country) and so far I’ve not had any problems.
646,I got into contact with 50+ Covid patients.

653,"I distinctly remember a clip of him saying masks are useless and that people in East Asia and other countries ""can do it all they want"" but he seemed dismissive on their efficacy."
654,He changed his mind later.
655,So that in my mind hurts his credibility a bit because that was when I was arguing in favor of masks when the government was telling people not to wear them.
656,"Unfortunately, we've taken American exceptionalism too seriously, and we tend to think anything outside the USA is backwards."
657,This makes it very hard for Americans to accept that other countries are doing better in any way.
658,"Americans are also very ideologically driven, and that requires a degree of belief that makes it difficult to reconcile reality with their belief."
659,"You end up with mass denial, and a belief that nobody could have done it any better than us."
660,So the travel industry written report that has been reposted here every 2 hours for the past couple of days might not be entirely correct??

672,This is also bad news for vaccine hopes.
673,And then Trump will claim he managed to get us through it on the first wave.
674,Actually maybe not.
675,"In France, the places that were the most hit by the first wave are now the places that are the less hit by the second."
676,"Since a large part of the population in these places caught it and are now immune, the spread is significantly slowed."
677,"As America first wave never really stopped and a lot more people caught it, the spread during the second wave will probably be slower and the wave will be flatter."
678,Source?
679,That isn't what i have read.
680,"&gt;The good news is that the longer-lasting IgG antibodies persisted in these same patients for up to four months, which is as long as the researchers were able to look."
681,Levels of those IgG antibodies also served as an indicator for the presence of protective antibodies capable of neutralizing SARS-CoV-2 in the lab.
682,"Even better, that ability didn’t decline in the 75 days after the onset of symptoms."
683,"While longer-term study is needed, the findings lend support to evidence that protective antibody responses against the novel virus do persist."
684,"https://directorsblog.nih.gov/2020/10/20/two-studies-show-covid-19-antibodies-persist-for-months/

718,"If you confirm you have antibodies and change your behavior, you may show the effectiveness of the vaccine more clearly when you get checked up."
719,"If you test positive for antibodies and change your behavior but get ill, you may prove the vaccine doesn’t work which is something they’re looking to prove."
720,"&gt; so the question that you should be asking is, 'What's making them sick?'"""

724,Wishful thinking at its finest.
725,We're gonna learn the hard way what a true third wave is like.
726,"let's see, that's... 24 reinfections... out of over 43 million cases."
727,a veritable fucking explosion of them.
728,"sorry, guess you were right!"
729,"As doctors learned more about the coronavirus and treatment methods improved, the death rate in the U.S. has also dropped."
730,"In May, 6% of diagnosed cases proved fatal, while less than 3% are today."
731,This improvement can reduce perceived severity.
732,People look at trends like these and let themselves be lulled into believing they’re less susceptible to COVID-19 or that the disease’s severity isn’t that bad.
733,"After all, one might reason, it’s been eight months and I haven’t gotten sick."
734,"I think what is clear is that the United States has handled the situation badly, so have we and many other European countries: which is a gross understatement."
735,"It is true that per capita the United States has actually done better, and despite what some people say that measure does matter because without relative comparitors you don't have a sense of how it is spreading."
736,I think the United States has the good fortune to be a massive country in terms of land mass and so fewer bodies to infect at close quarters.
737,New York is a good indicator of what can happen in densely populated areas.
738,"On the other hand, a lot of people in the United States have to go to work otherwise they'll be destitute and no one in their right mind is going to risk their families being homeless for almost anything - so in that respect the people of the United States should be afforded a bit more leeway when commenting."
739,"I can't say what is happening in the United States on a daily basis and in every day interaction, but in England I would never have guessed that so many people would have a blatant disregard for the well-being of this country and the people within it."
740,It's certainly led to me re-evaluating this country and it's sickening to watch really.
741,There's no cost to you wearing a mask though.

747,"It's kind of difficult to pin that down in the US and to a lesser extent, here in the UK."
748,Certain European countries have a more well defined graph that indicates the success of the systems they put in place to deal with COVID.
749,Covid needs to end sooner rather than later for the sake of how many people are vulnerable and dying.
750,The only thing I worry about in relation to this is that the economy is a mess and millions have fallen into poverty.
751,"If a stimulus package is able to be passed I worry if it's after the vaccine starts rolling out people will say, ""Oh covid is over."
752,There's a vaccine now.
753,"There's no need for stimulus."""
754,You have no idea what that means in practice.
755,Boosters every year is basically the same as not having a vaccine in terms of the logistic and societal challenges involved.
756,"Victoria is an Australian State, named after the then British monarch, Queen Victoria, just as there are US States named after or in honour of British kings and queens e.g."
757,"North and South Carolina, Georgia, Virginia and Maryland."
758,Our government had previously had a plan.
759,The administration now dismantled that plan then proceeded to tell everyone to pretend the danger didn’t exist.
760,You can’t say it’s the government’s fault with responsibility lies in the corruption of certain souls.
761,Agreed.
762,"I wish I could ""fail"" that bad in life."
763,"As a Chinese, I would like to say that the widely reported health QR code has played little role in China's fight against the virus."
764,"What is really effective is the large-scale strict quarantine and contact tracing, as well as the widespread use of masks."
765,Large-scale strict quarantine has effectively interrupted the spread of the virus; masks have reduced the infection rate when people make necessary interpersonal contact during the quarantine period; contact tracking can quickly identify potential infected persons and prevent them from continuing to infect other people.
766,"Although strict blockade has caused great inconvenience to people, it will also produce the best blocking effect."
767,"No society can withstand long-term blockade and isolation, so contrary to intuition, strict blockade is more harmful than mild blockade."
768,"Since the virus spreads very quickly, it is best to implement all these measures early enough."
769,"In addition, the ability to detect the virus on a large scale is essential to quickly find the infected person."
770,A vaccine that is 70% effective is good enough.
771,We're not waiting for a 9th generation vaccine to go back to normal.
772,"There should also be mandatory euthanasia for scientifically illiterate idiots who threaten collective survival with their stupidity, but we don't have that either."
773,"Even then, I think people who still refuse to take this seriously would make excuses.... but he/she was old, had underlying conditions, this was rare, so and so got it and they were fine, we can’t just stay locked down forever, “mental health”"
774,Even if 1/3 won’t take the vaccine 66% will.
775,This vaccination rate is actually better than the rate for the regular influenza shot.
776,Only 50% of Americans got a flu shot last year.
777,CDC’s national goal has always been 70%.
778,&gt; you can clearly see two peaks which were followed by a period of the declining daily new cases.
779,And right now we're in the third period of rising cases.
780,"The daily cases are always  keeping a comparatively high baseline in the US and never decline to a number that we could consider ""it has been contained""

Unlike German, they've had daily case number reduced to 200 or even below, compare to it's historical peak (about 5000per day), we could say ""they've got it controlled""."
781,"but recently their daily cases sharped to 15,000, that what we call ""the second wave"""
782,"Hoping for the best for you, Australia and the rest of the world."

789,It might be the case.
790,But one thing is to understand the risks involved and have a civil discussion about how hard it could be to close schools or which strategies might be put in place to reduce the risks.
791,"Another thing is what has been done all across europe: start from the principle schools will be functioning regardless of the risks involved then when cases rose close shops or take other measures, wasting even more time."
792,Proud to be Victorian but embarrassed to be related to so many dAn tHe tYrAnT idiots.
793,"Thing is while Sweden has a functioning state apparat and good professionals working for the government, mostly because of choices they got right in the 70s, our current crop of politicians are just the same self serving, arrogant spinners as everywhere else."

796,Everytime the culture industry and artists tried to bring her attention to those points it failed.
797,"(Ok arguing with myself here, but.)"
798,You could be on to something.
799,I think that the most scary real-worldsign that immunity doesnt last is that Belgium for example was one of the worst hit countries during the spring.
800,And now the cases are though the roof again.
801,"Shouldnt the immunity stop that, atleat partially."
802,"""Work began on the Oxford vaccine in January."
803,"Called AZD1222 or ChAdOx1 nCoV-19, the viral-vector vaccine is made from a weakened version of a common cold virus that causes infections in chimpanzees."""
804,"Even better news: it's not an rDNA-based vaccine so it's easier to get across the ""it's a conspiracy to alter human DNA"" crowd :)"
805,At what point does a wave become a tsunami?
806,Most vaccines prevent infection.
807,"Yes there will people with poor immune responses who still get a symptomatic infection, but they are also the ones who were likely to get seriously ill."
808,Ya
809,"I'm other news, grass is green"
810,Face palm.
811,What in the world is happening.
812,Immunity given by natural infection and immunity given by vaccination are likely to differ as well btw.
813,"Alaska Air is also blocking middle seats (through January 6, 2021)"
814,"The vast majority of infections, not just with Covid but with everything else, happen at home or at work."
815,Sharing a train wagon with a stranger for 20 minutes is not where you probably got covid
816,legalise marijuana with the emergency law
817,&gt; Well masks are subject to human behavior.
818,So it cannot be relied on.
819,Neither can lockdowns.
820,Humans gonna human.
821,The same could be said about seatbelts.
822,Almost everyone I know wears them now because the cops will ticket you if they catch you without one.
823,"Unfortunately in America the police don't want to enforce the mask mandate, but if they did, we'd have this closer to being under control."
824,"First wave, but we've also had three regional waves as the virus rolled across the country."
825,IMO I think 8 months is solid.
826,I think realistically it's just a year or so but 8 months is enough to vaccinate a lot of people.
827,Calm down jamal.
828,Yoi got told to stay inside not fight a war.
829,The reason it went on so long was due to quite a few of the population ignoring the restrictions..
830,"Italy is not the US though, don't people get paid during lockdown as if they were working?"
831,"How is it, “really not”?"
832,"Well firstly, March/April is probably better given the few documented cases in February, and even then all that tells us is that immunity appears likely for 8 months say."
833,"That does not mean it cannot start to wane over the coming months, and it waning is entirely in line with plausible current scientific understanding of this virus and other virus's."
834,"It's exactly the scenario we're trying to avoid: a swiss couple invited some 200 guests to their wedding, several were infected with SARS-COV-2 and showing symptoms; two weeks later the village celebrates their Oktoberfest, their Thanksgiving while new cases of infections showing all the symptoms of COVID-19 are popping up all around the village."
835,"The initial wedding guest agreed to keep their silence to avoid quarantines, the local people agreed to keep their silence to avoid economic issues related to their village having an uncontained and uncontainable outbreak."
836,"Only when  the national Minister of Health Affairs intervened, the couple celebrating their wedding agreed to disclose who's been attending the wedding; there is no way to trace who has been to the Oktoberfest."
837,F*cked up majorly.
838,[removed]
839,Great discipline.
840,Good for you people and keep vigilance!
841,I never had an issue with seat belts...
842,I just always put them on...
843,"But there are folks who are stupid, and now, because of them,  i even need to buckle up to move my car in the parking space since it wont run without belt at all..."
844,I still find the anology better than any others out there (esp.
845,from the Anti maskers side...)
846,"well yeah

did the numbers ever go down significantly or did they just stabilize and then shoot up?"
847,ofc they're still in the first wave
848,"Actually, seat belts do protect others."
849,It prevents the secured person from becoming a projectile in the vehicle.
850,I knew someone who was killed by a backseat passenger who refused to wear one.
851,The passenger lived but is paraplegic.
852,The selfish moron is now an online anti-mask crusader.
853,He brags about refusing masks and says he hopes to infect anyone who is enforcing or wearing them.
854,He is definitely a candidate for a personality disorder.
855,"We can be confident that once the vaccine is approved, the ""might-harm-me"" scenario can be discarded."
856,The only risk occidental governments are willing to accept is the risk of a moderate effectiveness.
857,It was absolutely worth it but hurt like hell at the same time.
858,Went through the ups and downs of this lockdown.
859,"There were big periods of hopelessness, especially when my salary was slashed and my wife went to jobseeker, but we held on."
860,Tomorrow (first day of lessened restrictions for the metropolitan area) will be magical.

863,same here.
864,Greetings from Germany.
865,"Looking at the seating chart it appears that the people sitting next to each other in groups were all infected before the flight and didn't infect other people, but it's impossible to know."
866,8 people recently travelled to Poland.
867,6 came back infected.
868,It has passed.
869,COVID started flaring up in February dude.
870,It's been 8 months.
871,"I heard from a credible source we are ""rounding the corner"" smh"
872,We joked in my country that when you angle the chart a bit the cases are flattened.
873,So much for the natural herd immunity crowd.
874,"' We should still be seeing more reinfections whether we can test for them or not '  


That's entirely dependent on how long immunity lasts for, as the article says immunity may only just be beginning to wane, we don't know yet."
875,What we cannot do is extrapolate and make claims about the immunity beyond 6-8 months because that length of time hasn't passed yet.
876,working as a disposable frontline worker i could have told you that
877,I work in a supermarket.
878,"Yesterday a woman comes shouting covid breath all over me, because she's noticed someone walking around the store talking on the phone with no mask."
879,Thanks lady.
880,The phone person didn't infect me.
881,You did.
882,"Fascism is bad but more effective in certain extreme circumstances, that is a fact literally taught in textbooks

883,"As a Melburnian, all I can say is...

886,Now go to Worldometer and count their dead
887,"Positive air pressure on the outside of the glasses created from either movement of the person through the air, or from the moving air blowing into the person, creates a negative air pressure zone behind the glasses."
888,This causes a vortex effect around the frame of the glasses.
889,This is why you get moisture collecting on the inside of your glasses when you walk through dense fog.
890,Also why you get dust accumulation on the inside of your glasses when you walk outside on a windy day.
891,Or why your eyes burn when campfire smoke is blown in your direction.
892,Or why you can feel Vick's Vap-o-rub in your eyes when you hold the open container near your face.
893,You want to avoid getting Corona in your eyes?
894,Wear goggles.
895,"Eye glasses are for vision correction, not aerosol protection."
896,This is basic common sense stuff.
897,Why are so many of you keen to defend this nonsensical idea of eyeglasses protecting you from Covid?
898,This sub is just bizarre.
899,"But fine whatever, I'm done with the lot of you."
900,Go ahead and downvote this one to oblivion too.
901,I just don't give a fuck anymore.

909,So what?
910,At least you don't miss any.
911,And Taiwan being completely free of corona is prove enough for me that it works.
912,Ah come on.
913,There is no evidence that Paris has an herd immunity effect slowing down the exponential increase in.infections.
914,Agree
915,Any business that loses money by staying open would simply shut down voluntarily.
916,You don't need to force anyone with the threat of fines to stop losing money.
917,&gt;just as there are US States named after or in honour of British kings and queens e.g.
918,"North and South Carolina, Georgia, Virginia and Maryland."
919,Today I learned.
920,Thanks man!
921,"FAKE NEWS

 THIS GUY WILL LISTEN TO THE SCIENTISTS!"
922,Please learn some basic immunology.
923,You have memory T cells and memory B cells.
924,Antibodies are produced by plasma cells that die off after a few months.
925,Antibodies dissipate after every infection.
926,Immunity comes from memory cells that last decades.
927,"As for immunity across strains, SARS1 produces neutralising antibody response against SARS2 and they are distant cousins."
928,Smallpox was eradicated with a different species of virus (cowpox).
929,"The 4 cold coronaviruses primarily infect children, indicating Adults already have immunity."
930,As long as a potential vaccine has high efficacy then local elimination is likely.
931,"According to Worldometers, Texas has already pulled ahead."
932,"&gt; think that we live in the outback and hunt crocodiles

Please don't tell me that crocodile dundee is not real."
933,I completely agree.
934,This idea that quarantine has no effect on introverts is so frustrating.
935,"I'm definitely an introvert and prefer being by myself most of the time, but spending all day every day inside my small apartment and not getting to see my family really sucks and it's driving me nuts."
936,Just wrote this in another comment but incase you miss it.
937,"there are 6 confirmed reinfections, 43 million cases."
938,So even if there is 100 000 times more reinfections hidden.
939,"There is still only about 1,5 % chance of reinfections."
940,And this does not take into account that there is a lot more than 43 million cases in reality.
941,However as you say immunity will most likely dissapear so we will se more cases of reinfections.
942,"But still atleat 8 months of immunity, statistically."
943,Or have i missed something?
944,"I'm a French PhD student, and I do some teachings."
945,&gt;Interesting.
946,"I had assumed that the reason so many Americans were anti-mask was because of the low quality of education in many areas presumably not covering basic biology/chemistry, or allowing students to pass without doing well in those courses

Your assumption is right, the education level in France is dropping."
947,This is especially true at the university level.
948,"But this only affect low and middle incomes, as pretty much every other parents are their childs in private schools."
949,Some low incomes kids do get through with enough motivation.
950,But a lot of them drop school at 16 without knowing more than basic reading skills (and writting is not included).
951,Yes.
952,I can't see a way out of collapse in the USA.
953,I have been recommending leaving that country for years now.
954,I think this Christmas many wealthy Americans will spend time getting familiar with the geography of new places.
955,In France the streets are empty starting with 1st of july.
956,The difference in the parisian metro between 26th of august and 4th of September is yiiuge!
957,Same goes for Spain more or less.
958,Modulo the tourists.
959,They even have summer schedules where they get off of work at 14h.
960,And I highly doubt people go to work in Poland as much in august as they do in November.
961,"But as I said, feel free to provide studies."
962,I am more than willing to change my opinion if it's warranted.
963,I wasn't able to see from the article whether the caught it on the flight or were positive before.
964,How many were infected on the flight?
965,"No you are probably right, it's just many people now seem to have it in their heads that a long time of immunity is a given with this virus and we can't say that with confidence yet."
966,Personality disorders are a subcategory of mental disorders.
967,"It further includes:

Cluster A (odd or eccentric disorders)

-	Paranoid personality disorder
-	Schizoid personality disorder
-	Schizotypical personality disorder

Cluster B (dramatic, emotional or erratic disorders)

-	**Antisocial personality disorder**
-	Borderline personality disorder (BPD)
-	Histrionic personality disorder
-	Narcissistic personality disorder

Cluster C (anxious or fearful disorders)

-	Avoidant personality disorder
-	Dependent personality disorder
-	Obsessive compulsive personality disorder (OCPD)

Antisocial personality disorder, the disorder discussed in the article, is known for disregarding and violation of rights of others, lack of empathy, manipulation, and impulsive behavior."
968,Antisocial personality disorder has strong links with psychopathy or scoring high on the sociopathy scale.
969,"Other mental disorders also exist, like autism and ADHD to name a few."
970,"But they are not personality disorders (in this case, they are developmental disorders)."
971,Hope that helps.
972,Masks work.
973,Thank you I been saying the same thing as an American it’s ridiculous really
974,The rest of Australia has already achieved this.
975,"NZ was also COVID normal for months, and swiftly contained a second outbreak."
976,Do you have any articles or anything on that?
977,Why did people downvote you?

980,"Dude, what does the science tell you."
981,I am not scientist so I might be just be wrong but what are your observations telling you.
982,We should still be seeing more reinfections whether we can test for them or not
983,"Oh fancy that, what a coincidence."
984,&gt;Wishing speedy recovery!
985,"At his rate Belgium will reach herd immunity (if it exists for that virus) by Christmas 

It's a r/iamgoingtohellforthis style comment but that's what  we can see coming"
986,*colleagues and I have the same problem.
987,Only sane person in a sea of anti-maskers....I'm boned...
988,They'd have to completely redo contracts and I sincerely doubt CPS has the money for the salary increases.
989,Why do they jump instantly to: reinfection is something to worry about now
990,"wherever it is, it will always beat this year's lineup...

have a shitload of fun next year, Skeletor Billy!"
991,"(and seriously, search videos on Paredes de Coura, it's one of the most beautiful places to host music festivals, with a natural amphitheater providing us with a great view to the stage, a scenic river nearby for some daytime relaxation, a nice village next to it filled with very nice people that are super proud to have the festival there."
992,portuguese food and hospitality can't be matched.
993,I've left Portugal 4 years ago and I miss it every single day.
994,and for next year they've already confirmed at least Jarvis Cocker and Pixies).
995,How can you make an observation of the long or medium term immunity of a virus that has only been around in significant numbers for half a year?
996,"Can you please explain to me how I am 'objectively wrong', I'm a practicing scientist and you seem to be misrepresenting what the science actually can say and what it can't."
997,I agree with everything you wrote.
998,Reinfections are probably a lot higher then we know.
999,"But, there are 6 confirmed reinfections, 43 million cases."
1000,So even if there is 100 000 times more reinfections hidden.
1001,"There is still only about 1,5 % chance of reinfections."
1002,And this does not take into account that there is a lot more than 43 million cases in reality.
1003,Hower as you say immunity will most likely dissapear so we will se more cases of reinfections.
1004,"But still atleat 8 months of immunity, statistically."
1005,Or have i missed something?
1006,"Seems a lot of people are confused by my use of ""bottomed out"", Meriam Webster says:

&gt; to reach a lowest or worst point usually before beginning to rise or improve"
1007,"Yeah, lockdown is probably the only solution if you want to close schools, because you need to force companies to let people home."
1008,Or diagnosable!
1009,"No, different parts of the country are in different waves."
1010,You know what.
1011,I'm probably more introverted than extroverted.
1012,But in social situations I make a fucking effort.
1013,"I go out, I host parties, I work hard because socialisation is important."
1014,I fucking hate it when self-described introverts use that as an excuse to not fulfill social responsibilities.
1015,"It's not okay to hide in your basement your entire life, and it's not okay to make it your friends responsibility to arrange social events, and to constantly be the one who reaches out."
1016,And its also not okay to have poor social hygiene that affects your mental health.
1017,"But on the flip side, when there is a fucking pandemic it's not okay to be like ""I'm an extrovert, so I have to go to this party""."
1018,We all have responsibilities to society and a description of your preferred level of social interaction is not an excuse to that.
1019,It is normal for the antibodies to decline.
1020,"The issue is that with other infections that we have a longterm immunity against, the decline results in a baseline antibody level."
1021,"If you've had mumps 10 years ago, when we take blood and analyze, we see a low but stable amount of antibodies."
1022,That is not the case with coronaviruses.
1023,Coronaviruses interfere with immune interactions during infection to prevent the establishment of long-term immunity.
1024,All successful viruses have tricks to stay in the population.
1025,"Some mutate very fast to evade immunity (influenza, HIV), some lead to persistent infection (Herpes, HPV, FSP), some infect you and you don't even realize you are infected because it is symptomless."
1026,"And coronaviruses use the trick of not raising long-term immunity, therefore they are able to re-infect."
1027,"Let's hope the 2nd, 3rd infections are milder, we don't have enough data on that yet."
1028,So I live in NJ and driving to different parts of the state is fast and easy.
1029,Im not sure how this is going to work.
1030,If the gym or resturant or business isnt open in one area you can literally drive to another one.
1031,I was going to mention that there's been a suspicious lack of Corona-chan memes ever since middle class USica started getting deeply affected.
1032,It's always a joke until it involves you...
1033,Will the Australia open be held as usual this January?
1034,my grandma winters in florida.
1035,she’s going on november 15th.
1036,i’m terrified for her.
1037,"&gt; 23 year old hospitalized, yet Reddit PhD's tell me it's just like a mild cold for anyone thats not in a nursing home."
1038,"Well, to be honest, she's a pregnant woman that probably has quite a lot of cash and good insurance."
1039,I'm not sure the hospitilization alone really says anything.
1040,It's how sick she actually got that is interesting.
1041,Which is apparently very sick.
1042,&gt;You seem to be making very sweeping statements that are not grounded in scientific fact.
1043,"wrong, like objectively wrong

I just look at the science dude."
1044,Part of science is making observations.
1045,What do the observations tell you?
1046,Ken oath mate
1047,I don't really understand the point of this.
1048,"There's a set of behaviors we call ""Antisocial Personality Disorder"" and there's a set of people who clearly don't give a shit about protecting other people from their germs... it seems obvious the set would significantly overlap."
1049,I'm missing something here- a reason to even bother studying it in the first place.
1050,"FYI stand for ""fucking yelling information,"" JSYK"
1051,Best move is to minimize travel no matter what state you live in.
1052,If people could have  stopped being selfish assholes for just a couple weeks we could have beaten this back in March.
1053,But no.
1054,Here we are 7 months later still getting our butts kicked.
1055,I 100% understand we all want life to resume and be able to play and see our friends.
1056,"Hell, I'd hug every stranger I passed since I miss touching so much...but the idea I might inadvertently kill someone...

Just stay home."
1057,"And if you have to go out, wear a GD mask correctly and keep your distance."
1058,Ok guys?
1059,The study was in Brazil though.
1060,"The results would probably not be all that different elsewhere, but still."
1061,"Ok but dont be surprised that scientific studies are more valued here than ""how you feel"""
1062,Yep worth it

1064,"The seat map suggests 4 groups traveling together were all infected, with only 1 (or possibly 2) individual passengers becoming infected."
1065,"If the infections were actually the result of traveling on the airplane, and not passengers spreading it among their own group of family/business associates, I would expect more of the single/non-group passengers to have become infected."
1066,That’s why we have T-Cells
1067,I edited it because I thought it needed more explanation.
1068,Source for what?
1069,You make a point.
1070,Obesity is more likely to kill them than covid.
1071,"BUT, 99.6% still means a .4% chance of death."
1072,If wearing a mask and doing what they’re doing isn’t ruining their life then who cares.
1073,That’d be like me telling you “hey I have a gun and there’s a .4% chance it has a bullet in it.
1074,"Can I try to shoot you?”

If the options are “mild/no inconvenience” and “.4% chance of getting shot in the head”, I’ll take the first one any day."
1075,For me literally all I have to do is wear a mask and not be in large groups.
1076,I’m already never in large groups and wearing a mask isn’t hard or bothersome like a bunch of idiots claim.
1077,So why not?
1078,"&gt;If we, as young healthy non-frontline or essential workers, aren’t vaccinated next year it will have meant there was a colossal failure in the distribution."
1079,"It looks like you're an expert in the field, since you're so absolutely certain how long distributing a vaccine to the entire world should take."
1080,Please enlighten us then.
1081,Do you know anything about the manufacturing process of a vaccine?
1082,Do you know anything about the refrigeration needs during transport and storing and how that affects the whole supply chain?
1083,"Or maybe tell us what you know about the actual vaccine administration capacity constraints, if we had unlimited vaccine supply?"
1084,"How long does it take to administer a vaccine, how trained do the people have to be?"
1085,"With the current setup, the country where I live performs ~59000 tests a day, which is about 1% of the country's population."
1086,"But can those same people working in the test stations administer the vaccine, if we had it tomorrow?"
1087,I doubt it.
1088,"So please enlighten us with your knowledge, or stop talking out of your ass, there is enough misinformation as is."
1089,"I don't know all the answers to those questions, but I listen to the experts when they say that young people will probably have to wait until 2021."
1090,"the policy goes: schools or entertainment venues (bars, restaurants, clubs)."
1091,"Getting r0 below 1 for a sustained period of time is what I refer to as ""suppressing the virus""."
1092,Many countries achieved this for a couple of months and therefore they should be considered to be in their second wave now.
1093,Can we plz roll this vaccine out (with a cherry on top)
1094,"I feel like you’re fucking with me, but I’m not sure."
1095,"I'm definitely not going to call it bad news, but there's not enough data (at least in the west) to suggest how good it actually is."
1096,"I dont want to be one of those people using up valuable societal resources, but yeah maybe ill write them ill see."
1097,I know there is atleast one credible journalist looking into it.
1098,Totally agree with youre last paragraph.
1099,"Yeah, back in the spring I remember Swiss hospitals were taking in French patients from overwhelmed regions."
1100,It makes sense to try every resource available.
1101,"It can cling to particles in the air for hours, that requires airborne precautions."
1102,Agreed.
1103,But we aren’t doing the most basic steps to prevent the spread of the virus.
1104,The US closed its asylums in the 60s.
1105,We're seeing the consequences of it now.
1106,Ahhh there he is.
1107,He shows up every thread.
1108,"Where is the equally clever ""water is wet"" guy?"
1109,"I did, all they did was add info we already knew."
1110,"While you're right (and getting downvoted anyway), I guess that would only be an OK response if they were locking down travel between states."
1111,"The federal government seized and redistributed medical materials for the states when they tried that anyway, so regardless of their official line they didn't just 'let states handle it'."
1112,I think that was just a way to pass as much responsibility off as possible.
1113,take my upside-downvote
1114,yup i agree
1115,Distraction fallacy
1116,"Yea, no."
1117,This kind of studies obviously cannot filter out a myriad of confounding factors.
1118,this is going to be harsh... but i hope somewhat we can swing through

I think its reasonable to ask when all demographics (elderly being one) were ever  not at some elevated risk compared to the rest of the population."

I won’t lie to you, due to the rushed nature of these vaccines and the amount of vaccines that were promising but failed, I have to be honest and say I might wait just a little bit."

1160,"I’m not antivax by any stretch of the imagination, but this is the first vaccine where my thoughts are “ehh.. let’s see how it plays out”."
1161,"I really am hoping for a successful vaccine, in which case I’ll get it."
1162,All I’m saying is I’ll need some sort of evidence to show this vaccine won’t affect me.
1163,I’m in my early 20’s so the virus isn’t too much of a threat to my health.
1164,I’ll just continue wearing a mask and trying to remain away from people until I am confident that there is no vaccine risk.

1166,"&gt; Karens may be too kind a word for some

Kunts?"
1167,To be fair it´s mandatory to wear masks there.
1168,I remember AF saying this about masks early on and when he later admitted to lying due to the shortage of PPE for Healthcare workers I stopped trusting him.
1169,I listen to what he says but I  take it with a grain of salt.
1170,I can't fathom any expert in their field who was hired to protect the health of the public could lie for any reason.
1171,I wonder now if he regrets not telling us to wear a damn homemade cotton mask which is exactly what many of us did.
1172,Number of deaths.
1173,Exactly.
1174,"I still don´t think it will happen, the RKI keeps saying restaurants and bars and the main reason for the rise of infections, and the other prime ministers don´t wanna close anything, except for Bavaria."
1175,I just don’t understand why schools are open anywhere.
1176,"I thought it was also to do with the R number, less than 1 means it's no longer spreading, more than 1 means it's spreading."
1177,The ass-hats are the people who aren’t wearing masks or taking responsibility for their own safety.

A small example of that lack of transparency, I am trying to figure out, all of us with internet can access all of the registered cases on the website of our government."

1204,"(90+ is generalized but that makes sense) 

It might just be some weird privacy thing but all of the cases are mathmatically made anonymous already so I don't quite understand yet."

1236,In the U.S only 66% of excess deaths are from Covid this year - it's possible that due to stressed medical infrastructure and economic disaster for many are what are causing the rest.
1237,In places with widespread poverty like Mexico it's tough to tell how much the epiphonema of Covid are responsible for the excess deaths versus the disease itself.

1257,"2% is relatively accurate, yeah."
1258,"But while 2% seems small and insignificant, think about how many people that is."
1259,There are 350 million people in the US.
1260,"If 2% of the population dies by the end of this, that’d be 7 million people dead."
1261,"Obviously it won’t reach that high because not everyone will get it, but that’s 2% of 350 million."

1267,What measures if not the ones related the FoHMs strategy and recommendations are Morgan talking about?
1268,When Morgan says “...have all the time included...” “... in every situation...” that really sounds like all the measures since the beginning of the pandemic and not a few specific measures they asked about this summer as you imply.
1269,In the interview he is answering a question specifically about the number of participants in public events.
1270,It seems hard to argue limits on public gatherings are not part of FoHMs strategy even though it is not within their direct jurisdiction.
1271,Most elements in the strategy are not directly under the jurisdiction of FoHM but is their advice and recommendations to other authorities.
1272,You should the article and see what the scientists conducting the study have to say about it.
1273,"Idk, how you came to that thought process, but I know believe you to be retarded."
1274,Good day.
1275,By Easter 🙄 sigh
1276,Social distancing seems to have been their only plan.
1277,Our leaders failed us.
1278,It seems like different source says different numbers.
1279,Because that list is official (not from WHO or something) it seems.
1280,Its just a other newspaper keeping track?
1281,"Anyway it doesnt matter really, 6, 24 or even hundred doesnt change that, currently, according to the known cases and known reinfections."
1282,Immunity not lasting more then 8 months is a anomaly.
1283,It’s one and the same mechanism with complying with regulations and public health authority advice and feeling superior for it.
1284,How wearing a mask or not could become such a polarizing issue and not be just a pragmatic decision is beyond me

1290,Jersey too!
1291,The argument would be that typically those with mild disease (not requiring hospitalization or oxygen) typically do well and recover on their own.
1292,What therapeutic benefit do these antibodies provide?
1293,Do they lessen the number who progress to moderate or severe disease as compared to a control group?
1294,"Do they lower the number of symptomatic days, like Tamiflu?"
1295,I’m for wearing masks but no one should be publicly shamed for not wanting to wear one I believe in wearing a mask but i’m not going to force it on other people.
1296,"It's not a matter of ""I want/I don't want to"", you just do it and not think about it."
1297,"it's probably disturbing to have your worldview relentlessly invalidated by the universe, but you seem to be taking it particularly hard"
1298,"I’ve seen three articles saying three different contradictory things about immunity today on this sub, this is a strange sub indeed."
1299,I got mine for the normal price back in March or April in Germany as well.
1300,Doesn't seem like there's a huge spike in demand for those.
1301,Maskhole.
1302,"Unlike American, who's food is mostly modified Italian, German or Mexican."
1303,British curries were brought here by immigrants from Bangladesh and are very adapted for the local palate.

1305,Best admitting that most countries have a complex mix of cuisines.
1306,'Traditional British food' it's generally very nice if cooked with good ingredients- it's just not spicy or super exciting.. what many people picture as bad British food comes from the post-WW2 era.

1315,The US's new supreme court justice had covid over the summer (something she hid until there was an outbreak she was near).
1316,Hopefully SHE isn't suffering from cognitive issues.
1317,"The study was 6 months so yes, I guess that’s the longest they can know."
1318,Obviously other countries had outbreaks that lasted longer than 7 months.
1319,I don’t know if they have published immunity studies.
1320,Lack of testing- we know there are reinfections.
1321,And there are apparently many more anecdotal reports- from doctors as well as patients.
1322,Do you remember how long it took for other info/data on this virus to develop?
1323,They didn’t even change the covid symptom list until halfway through the pandemic.
1324,The virus has been around since Dec-that’s barely 10 months.
1325,Seeing studies that show antibody levels fall after roughly 8.
1326,I claimed it was possible- not certain.
1327,OP pondered what other explanation there is for this.
1328,Here’s one.
1329,There is still not even remotely enough evidence here to support herd immunity.
1330,It’s literally an assumption.
1331,It’s not even an implication.
1332,"They are proanti, except when it comes to antif_ascists, then they are antianti."
1333,"Opinions in the US:

2016 - we need to do everything we can to help the 1% !"
1334,"2020 - only 1% die from this, fuck them."
1335,The only difference between these groups of 1% er’s ?
1336,Their wealth status.
1337,"Lol, no."
1338,"I mean, this is a perfect opportunity to let these people get out of the territory and start a new life somewhere (somewhere lost) where they can display their sociopathic behavior and their freedom is respected."
1339,I know this is just a fantasy but I wish I was being realistic.
1340,"As stated in this article, deaths per day are in the 700s and rising."
1341,He's right
1342,Fucking cowards.
1343,"No, they do not need two weeks."
1344,Read the actual article.
1345,&gt;Boulware said that a data monitoring board could still review the data  relatively quickly - perhaps in less than a day - once the trial hits  its first interim point.
1346,Yea well so was obama for being black.
1347,Paywalled
1348,Why would Sweden do something?
1349,"It offered absolutely no risk, and if Danes wanted to come here to spend money they are welcome."
1350,"If we were to take revenge everytime Denmark did a dick move to us (refugees, blaming us for their crimes, dumping massive amounts of shit on our coast, moaning until we close our nuclear power plants, etc), we would do nothing else."
1351,"But at the same time, I think Sweden should have cut Bornholm off with no previous notice just for the lols."
1352,Quite amusing they close the country to Sweden but need to cross Sweden to access a part of their country.
1353,Not surprised
1354,Shocking .... no one.
1355,Hysteria is harmful
1356,That is inaccurate.
1357,We have one of our providers who tested positive in June and then test positive again mid-October.
1358,She had really minor symptoms both times.
1359,It wasn’t a ninja edit.
1360,I didn’t even see this reply until today when I responded.
1361,"&gt; If covid didn’t happen trump would have won in a landslide

you so funny"
1362,So much for all the spin the airline industry has been doing.
1363,"Ok, air gets recycled every few minutes."
1364,But I still have to breathe that air for those few minutes continuously over a multiple hour flight.
1365,"I’ve heard that’s only true when the plane is in the sky and that it’s all recirculating air when still on the ground, which gives you more than enough time to catch COVID-19 from someone sitting anywhere near you on the plane."
1366,This woman is personally quite happy to wear a mask &amp; not have my lack of makeup &amp; facial expressions policed by other people
1367,"I feel like this goes against the NPR narrative, so I am prone to believe it, because they don’t have anything to gain philosophically from it."
1368,Haha.
1369,Thanks man.
1370,It really is a hard time for the entire world right now.
1371,The country is too big to include the whole thing in one wave.
1372,I’m in NY.
1373,We had our first wave in April.
1374,Second is starting now.
1375,As good as this is it really means it wont be available for the public for a few months after than and then you have to worry about the timeline for distribution.
1376,It could easily still be spring 2021 until you can get your hands on this.
1377,He would not have won in a landslide.
1378,He pissed people off and commuted crimes before covid.
1379,There data only suggested he had a better chance than now to win and that is with updated poll methodology.
1380,People keep parroting this crap.
1381,"Funny how nobody ever thought about oxygen levels for ski masks, race car drivers or Doctors that have had to wear masks for 30 hours sometimes before this pandemic."
1382,&gt; I have to be honest and say I might wait just a little bit.
1383,"See if it causes any shit illness or side effects, or if it even works

This is why we have trials."
1384,That is the waiting.
1385,"If no one was waiting, they'd have begun vaccinating last spring."
1386,Brain bones mmmm
1387,Aaaw....  Fair game.
1388,Looking at you South Dakota
1389,Someone actually downvoted you for having some self-awareness.
1390,🤦‍♂️ Take my upvote.
1391,Airlines dont decide how often to recycle the air.
1392,The plane is built the same no matter who is flying it.
1393,"* A confirmed reinfection requires a positive test the first time,  a positive test the second time,  samples to be kept both times,  and for the two strains to be different to allow confirmation."
1394,The first two are an independent 10% or so for the average person worldwide.
1395,"Combining the others and we may, I'd guess,  have 100,000x more reinfections than confirmed ones."
1396,This is still a tiny number.
1397,* Anecdotes of reinfection are everywhere but not that numerous.
1398,If 25% of people could be reinfected within the timeframe I think they should be far more common.
1399,Keep in mind though you still have to be exposed twice.
1400,If we estimate 10-20% of the US has caught COVID then 2.5-5% should be eligible for reinfection and of those 0.25-1% would have been actually exposed again.
1401,"800,000-3.3m people in the US."
1402,It's this possible?
1403,"* If reinfection were even close to as severe we would not see deaths and cases decline in places with herd immunity,  like Sao Paolo, Manaus, and Delhi."
1404,"But,  at least in Brazilian cities where mortality is tracked,  deaths spiked then dropped back to baseline."
1405,* Antibodies may wane in number yet still provide immunity.
1406,"The study linked here does not give any distribution of antibody titer counts,  which is a red flag for me."
1407,* Antibodies may not even be as important as t cells to protective immunity.
1408,Unfortunately T cells are several orders of magnitude more expensive to study.
1409,It seems like we need a breakthrough in t cell detection to advance the science of them.
1410,"That moment when you're still in the first wave, yikes"
1411,Dicknoses everywhere.
1412,Good point.
1413,"Counterpoint: my own lived experience says ""no LOL thats why they got infected is they didn't and still don't"""
1414,Yep!
1415,I live in Chicago.
1416,"Talked with my GF and if this happened and we had a kid in school, we would do anything we could to make sure that they wouldn't have to go into the germ pool."
1417,We are both very lucky to be able to work from home.
1418,"I definitely felt like they were giving us the ""delayed flight"" treatment."
1419,"You know, how airlines will continually tell you your flight is only delayed by another 30min until it's been 6 hours or the flight is cancelled?"
1420,"Diagnostically speaking, antisocial personality generally coincides with poor impulse control and poor risk assessment."
1421,See how we've delved from talking about the topic at hand to you just throwing insults at me.
1422,Every move made away from the original topic was made by you while I tried to inch us back towards it.
1423,But you're right.
1424,I'm the one who doesn't know how to argue.
1425,"Look up ad hominem, cutie pants."
1426,Every day another news article to panic people.
1427,We just had a swedish report that found after three months everyone had antibodies built up.
1428,They also found no real dimished response after three months in terms of antibodies.
1429,However in some cases a more refined detection system was needed to find the antibodies.
1430,It actually wasn't.
1431,Back then Skåne had lower levels of infection than Copenhagen.
1432,There was a day when a five hour long queue formed in the border from Danes coming back after holidaying in Sweden.
1433,"As you can imagine, nothing happened out of this."
1434,Border closures are a Danish national sport.
1435,They love finding an excuse to do this
1436,Reminds me of the weird leadership training course.
1437,Though I was at a casual luncheon were General Abizaid and friends were reminiscing about Fulda Gap bunker duty.
1438,Can we just save time and ask Ben Shapiro ?
1439,Yikes

1441,I tell you!
1442,While others might try to push all the responsibility on Trump you are defending him on all fronts no matter how much he fucks up or lies.
1443,You are in no way better.
1444,In fact my personal opinion that you people are worse.
1445,I'll block you now.
1446,Can't deal with morons like you right now.
1447,\*Only\* 2%.
1448,Would you get on a bus knowing that one of the passengers wouldn't get off it alive?
1449,"On the other hand, it's about 2% of positive tested cases, and there are many more that aren't being identified through testing."
1450,"oh right, .04 percent..my bad

Either way, it's not that bad people are making it out to be"
1451,"If pretty much everything except for schools is closed, what makes you think that closing schools would make that much of a difference?"
1452,Looks like valved is still higher than surgical.
1453,I'm annoyed that they did all that and did6 test a fitted half or full face respirator.
1454,&gt;  I’d like to apply for a grant to study the wetness of water.

1457,Where did it say in the article the virus was spread in flight?
1458,"It shouldnt be surprising to anyone that asymptomatic people are flying around and subsequently spreading the virus, but I still believe actual transmission in flight is rare."
1459,"Rightwing loonies are terrified, for some reason, of octogenarian women

ok, women generally"
1460,I'm sorry people feel this is just a scam to beat Trump.
1461,"I hope your countrymen stay home, if they can, and believe in the seriousness."
1462,I'm in Japan.
1463,The government is lying and the people aren't serious.

1465,"Without big parties, it can't spread easily."
1466,"So, I'm lucky in a way."
1467,I will think of you and hope your sickness ends soon.
1468,"You’re still underwater, so doesn’t really matter how many waves are above you."
1469,Many countries in Europe and elsewhere did have a brief moment where their head was above water at least even some with dry feet.
1470,"The US is still under the waves, just looking at the graph and anyone can see that."
1471,It’s no complicated it’s also a bit irrelevant.
1472,"It’s very likely the cares with rocket up during the winter months, things are going to get a lot worse."
1473,"I currently live in spain, numbers are fairly awful again here and we are no under some new restrictions."
1474,Just wear a mask and just accept we will all have to make changes for the good of all.
1475,We are all pretty well fucked for some time to come.
1476,Shitty politics don’t really help.
1477,It just baffles me we have got to the point that we argue and don’t follow sound scientific advice.
1478,We have gone backwards.
1479,Fix the abortion laws.
1480,Problem solved.
1481,1.
1482,Your math sucks.
1483,2.
1484,"Your risks of getting the virus are not 2% - it's hard to say but if the US has an average of 100k cases for the next four months, and is identifying 40% of those, that's about 10% of the population that will be infected this winter."
1485,3.
1486,"That said, even with a pre-existing condition, a young person probably doesn't have a 2% chance of death; an older person would though."
1487,4.
1488,"But if it were 2% of 2%, it'd be a 0.04% chance of dying."
1489,"&gt;forced to accept it at gun point

I'm fine with giving them the option of being expelled to Liburdy Island where they can try to Snake Plissken their way through life with their like minded peer group."
1490,You can’t think of a way unapproved vaccines could be available?

1513,The “few questions on a survey” are taken from the DSM-5 and Affective and Cognitive Measure of Empathy questionnaires that psychiatrists use to diagnose antisocial personality disorders.
1514,"Practically all psychiatric diagnoses rely on the use of self-reported thoughts, feelings, and behaviors."
1515,"Of course the questions alone can’t diagnose such a disorder without being examined by a psychiatrist, but the study does not claim an association between compliance and diagnosed antisocial disorders but with *antisocial traits*."
1516,The study itself points out its limitations as all published research does.
1517,No one study is the be-all-end-all on a hypothesis.
1518,I don’t see anything about their methodology that is “piss poor” though.
1519,I think there is no way of knowing till we make changes.

1913,I'm not an anti-masker but I also don't intend to wear one the rest of my life.

1915,Uh oh...
1916,"My brain hasn’t lost much per decade so far, in a large number of decades."
1917,"Lol i do not think it would stand to reason, unless you're apartment has some crazy expensive HVAC system filtering the air?"
1918,Ah.
1919,Got ya.
1920,"Yeah, proper mask donning/doffing is key."
1921,"I’m sure I get some looks when I drive short distances in my mask, but typically I just leave it on in between stops if I’m running multiple errands."
1922,"Hopefully the mask will bind the virus particles and droplets enough to make the “pocket masks” useful both ways, but should at least cut down on exhaled virus."
1923,"I’m not against masks, and I think they should be worn, but the idea propagated now that all we have to do is wear masks a few hours a day and everything would be fine is silly, and there is no science to back that up."
1924,[removed]
1925,"There's a big difference between not caring, and talking outside with no masks to a neighbor for a bit."
1926,"The risk profile of that activity is incredibly low, even if not separated by 6'."
1927,"I wear a mask religiously, isolate, and so on."
1928,"But if I'm taking my trash to the curb without a mask on, and stop to say hi to a neighbor for five minutes while outside, this isn't really a risk, IMHO, we just aren't seeing it transfer that way."
1929,"Nah, it's going away very soon."
1930,Or it's just a fake news hoax.
1931,Or something.
1932,Dear Leader told us.

1935,You dont live in Ontario so you haven't really seen all the damage that Ford has caused.
1936,"He is HATED by pretty much everyone right now, which is totally different than the summer."
1937,"In fact his latest fk up was one of his maverick MPPs was in an illegal gathering of almost 60 people, no masks, no distancing and instead of punishing him Ford said the kid made a mistake."
1938,And that was it.
1939,And then went on to lecture everyone else for going to much shorter gatherings on thanskgiving..
1940,Wear gasketed glasses (e.g.
1941,"for motorcyclists) or goggles (lab or tactical, with no vent holes)."
1942,Goggles have been shown to decrease incidence of infection 8-16%.
1943,There's some evidence that plain old glasses help too - glasses + face shield may help more.
1944,Exactly.
1945,A close friend of mine caught it in early April.
1946,He practices MMA and works out every day.
1947,He doesn’t smoke or drink.
1948,Didn’t know he had it and seven months later fainted.
1949,(for the first time in his life) Went to the doctor to see what was wrong and he had blood clots in his lungs.
1950,He’s 34 years old.
1951,Didn’t realize he had it until the doctor explained the symptoms he had in early April.
1952,He didn’t realize it was causing this much damage.
1953,"He simply told me he was tired going up and down stairs but he could walk and run a mile, no problem."
1954,"Doctor said, he’s lucky it didn’t get to his heart."
1955,He has to now be on blood thinners for a year.
1956,"If narcissistic people are initially barley having symptoms when they get infected, some of them will be in for a rude awakening."

1958,https://fortune.com/2020/08/24/oxford-astrazeneca-covid-vaccine-deal-pricing-profit-concerns/
1959,Then continue wearing a mask if YOU want.
1960,Free will.
1961,"To the people who want to properly socialize and interact with humans without seeing only half of the other person’s face, they’re not doing an “extra year or two” of mask wearing."
1962,Especially after being vaccinated.
1963,That's quite a stat wrt ischemic strokes.
1964,Do you have a link supporting that?
1965,This is personal experience and so totally unrepresentative for reality.
1966,But my experience points other direction.
1967,IME people not wearing mask around me tend to be more like the narcissist type with a lot of social skills and resources.
1968,Antisocial solitary type is wearing a mask in a religious way.
1969,Edit: After carefully re-reading might be a common pattern.

1972,Oh.
1973,Good.
1974,God.
1975,I want to write more but I'm speechless.
1976,I could see this leap in logic but I can't fathom believing it lol.
1977,"Though my argument would be less ""how powerful he'll make America"" and more ""how awful he's been as a president and how horribly he's treated the rest of the world""."
1978,"Still don't believe it but shit I'd go along with it, fake or not, if it meant getting him out of that office lol"
1979,So how many days was it from 8 million cases to 9 million?
1980,"It did work (while the total numbers were low) in Germany, but immediately people complained that it's too complicated."
1981,If you didn't watch Totally Under Control I would recommend it.
1982,It's almost Providence levels of practice and insight that were just COMPLETELY ignored to let this thing off the rails.
1983,"OK, I'm glad about that."
1984,What tools do you mean?
1985,Cool study but why not use that time spent in that study for finding a cure?
1986,Lmao
1987,That’s not how the saying works though.
1988,"Yes there were hundreds of better days then today, but they leads to a sense of “tried nothing and it’s too late” when we are still in the 2nd inning of this thing."
1989,What airline was this?
1990,I also jaywalk and eat the best part of the nachos
1991,"Since day 1 of Kanye I've been like ""well there's the most shameless self promoter in any room""."
1992,The only thing that's changed my opinion on that was when he went to the White House.
1993,This is the system we built....based on companies short term profit and shareholders gains.
1994,The pandemic and human lives be damned!
1995,"It's okay, the US will wait another 3-4 weeks to take action, just after it starts getting really bad."
1996,As is tradition.
1997,"This thing weakens your heart, your lungs, and a lot of your other organs."
1998,This is the AGING disease
1999,Mask under the nose: we at least now know who the mouth breathers are due to this pandemic.
2000,Disappointed with Southwest but all the airlines will be unblocking them in early January.
2001,Policies can change but none are committing to it indefinitely.
2002,JetBlue is actually no longer guaranteeing empty middle seats just restricting plane capacity to 70% (this policy started Oct 16 until Dec 1).
2003,I’m never going to go to South Dakota
2004,Banks are rigorously stress tested under federal law as a result of those bail-outs.
2005,"You will see bail-outs happen again, but it won't happen anytime soon in banking."
2006,That industry is airtight and highly regulated at the present moment.
2007,"The federal Reserve reserve released their results for that stress test in July: https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/bcreg20200625c.htm

JP Morgan set aside [10 Billion](https://www.wsj.com/articles/jpmorgan-profit-drops-51-as-bank-sets-aside-billions-for-coronavirus-loan-losses-11594725161) in cash reserves to cover potential loan defaults in July this year."
2008,Other banks have followed suit.
2009,Gives a new meaning to No Brainer...
2010,What am I supposed to be looking at here?
2011,A myth?
2012,"Nah, there is a constant effort to help encourage unrest."
2013,"All’s fair in love and war, and there are plenty of Americans dumb enough to fall for the propaganda, but it’s no myth that Russia uses social media to influence useful idiots."
2014,"I'm not sure you understand he what's happening - New Zealand isn't locked down now, they are free."
2015,"I'm in the middle of Melbourne and am going to the pub on Friday,  safely."
2016,"Actually I got time off work and am going out 5 days in a row, because like most people I want to help the economy and support hospitality get back."
2017,The only reason I am doing this is because it is safe to.
2018,"From my understanding most places who haven't had lockdown are economically suffering anyway, because noone wants to go out because it is not safe, and because there is no forced lockdown there is no government support for affected people."
2019,We get paid to stay home if we need to self isolate.
2020,We still get paid if we can't go to work during lockdown.
2021,"If you look at how the rest of Aus and NZ have been going for the last 6 months, with virtually no lockdowns since the original, you should see its sustainable once the cases are low enough."
2022,Even Sweden is locking down a bit now and they were going for herd immunity.
2023,Iowa hasn't locked down at all and their economy is still fucked.
2024,"It is definitely a sacrifice, but most things worth doing are."
2025,You need Jesus..
2026,"...I heard he was in Stockholm last week bringing back covid victims, you should go there."
2027,"There's a lot going on here, and I don't think you can so easily come to that conclusion."
2028,I think if we would see something like march/april the number of deaths would be way bigger now.
2029,"We are facing a new wave but the hospitals and the  healthcare professionals are more prepared to deal with it, maybe this second wave wont be as letal as the first."
2030,Best of luck to the millions of guinea pigs.
2031,"&gt;Holy crap, you cannot be more dense."
2032,"Look, I would also be frustrated and ashamed if my country had handled this as badly as Sweden, but there's no need for the incivility."
2033,Being critical of Sweden's strategy is not the same as rooting for Sweden to fail.
2034,And who says that the lockdowns in the countries you mentioned didn't have an effect?
2035,You need to understand that most of these countries are very different from Sweden.
2036,They are large European countries  with a much higher population and much bigger cities.
2037,They have different social structures and it's very common for multiple generations to live together and they have a lot fewer single person house holds.
2038,"They have a less developed social security net, they don't have the same opportunities for home office, and so on."
2039,In a way Sweden is an island similar to NZ considering how well Sweden's neighbors have handled this so far.
2040,But still Sweden has failed so hard compared to the neighbors they usually compare themselves to (and also compared to most of the world).
2041,Something is not right.
2042,"It's not that there are guaranteed to be 3 waves or something, and for us they're prolongated."
2043,"The vaccine will change everything, no matter how many waves hit us on the way there."
2044,"Lol white guys kill people on American soil because they want to no other reason, racists like you can't see the difference."
2045,"My comment was referring more to this part of their planned employment discrimination:

&gt;I figure out a reason not to hire them"

2049,"&gt;I've got largest stock crash in history penned in myself

but do you have the balls to put your money where your mouth is?"
2050,Have you shorted anything?
2051,"Honestly, theres so little data Im not suprised if it hadnt shown up."
2052,Anyone living in Uppsala?
2053,Has there been any effect of the stricter recomendations?
2054,Effect as in fever people in shops etc
2055,How is arbitrary discrimination illegal?
2056,"&gt;I figure out a reason not to hire them

2057,Positive percentage at 1.5%.
2058,Raw case numbers don't really mean much without context.
2059,[deleted]
2060,That is not true.
2061,They are OSHA and NIOSH certified and there are fit tests to ensure no leakage.
2062,"If you have an elastomeric respirator that leaks, you need to get a different one that fits you properly."
2063,"Actually, it was a CW series."
2064,Netflix was just rerunning old seasons.
2065,Are you in a normal country or the US though?
2066,(X) Pressure
2067,Financial aid doesn’t do anything when the problem is solitude and useless zoom classes that students pay thousands for.
2068,"Fuck the pandemic, it’s not worth it anymore."
2069,Point blank.
2070,"Apparently planes have better air circulation and filters than many indoor spaces, but there is clearly still a risk, as shown by this article."
2071,"Tell that to protesters lol

To all the downvoters ."
2072,Protesters can go suck a big fat one .
2073,They think they are above everyone else lol fuck that u losers get in your house like everyone else
2074,I mean really!
2075,Only an idiot wouldn't.
2076,"This has to do with Sweden's decentralized hospital system, which has its advantages but is certainly not optimal during a crisis such as a pandemic."
2077,"Each of Sweden's 21 regions is responsible for its own health care, and each of those regions are responsible for reporting their own covid numbers to FHM (Sweden's health agency), which then compiles the numbers."
2078,"What happened was that one of these region discovered it had reported 31 deaths that should not be counted according to FHM's guidelines (probably more than 30 days had passed between covid test and death date, which must've been missed at first), and corrected its numbers."
2079,There is also a parallell statistic made by Socialstyrelsen that looks at death certificates instead.
2080,"It should be a bit more reliable, but it is not updated quite as often (only once a week)."
2081,&gt;until the majority of US is vaccinated.
2082,I fear many won't get family members or themselves vaccinated.
2083,Then they'll see COVID disappear and claim victory without a vaccine even though they only survived or weren't impacted because everyone else got a shot.
2084,I know rural areas are not homogenous blocs at all.
2085,"And I don't wish anything bad on the people who did the right thing through this and really, the last 40 (yes, 40) years, no matter where they live."
2086,We're just living in a time of absolute mass brainwashing.
2087,Turning people into enemies of each other.
2088,"I know whites (I'm white, btw) who *hate* other people just because they're black/brown/foreign/refugee, and they were told to blame them, even though that isn't the truth."
2089,They just want an easy target to hit.
2090,Please listen to yourself.
2091,"You are literally sticking your fingers in your ears because you think you can just rely on ""common sense""."
2092,"Can you imagine what the world would be like if scientists rejected any findings that didn't fit with their own preconceptions of ""common sense""."
2093,"It's ""common sense"" to anti-vax morons that sticking a needle with a dormant virus into you will make you more ill than not."

2099,I’m am independent conservative.
2100,I wear a mask everywhere unless I’m sure I’m not going to come into contact with folks.
2101,It’s called common decency and respect.
2102,Politics leanings aren’t the sole reason.
2103,It’s just sadly a lot of my conservative brethren tend to be self centered assholes.
2104,"Schools shouldnt be closed no matter what, highschool+ maybe, not worth potentially destroying a generation of children because of virus with this mortality"
2105,One tool in the war chest.
2106,Not the cure.
2107,But you and your free dumbs already know that
2108,It will materialize on its own.
2109,THE GUY HELD THEM THERE AFTER THEY STABBED HIM MULTIPLE TIMES UNTIL THE COPS COULD COME...... he is a TANK
2110,People who can’t take the vaccine or do not produce an immune response should be a very small number.
2111,"It sounds cold and maybe it is, but we cannot alter everyone’s lives for these few."
2112,You could probably think of several conditions which society doesn’t make alterations for due to the small number of sufferers.
2113,All we need is for death levels to get to about the same level or slightly higher than the flu and we’ll be done with restrictions.
2114,This level has already been deemed acceptable by society.
2115,[removed]
2116,So like the general population then?
2117,"This is helping me to put brexit in context, thank you"
2118,Kind of like COVID lol!
2119,😂 the irony
2120,You said deadly communicable airborne diseases.
2121,I’m not comparing the two in terms of severity but both cover all 3 of your criteria?
2122,Where’s the cutoff?
2123,The world would disagree.
2124,"I mean come on, the alternative to the US being the superpower is Russia or China filling that role, and that’s an awful thing."
2125,Let's just hope the death rate keeps going down.
2126,"Hell, maybe people will even start wearing masks and respecting physical distancing and we can bend the curve again."
2127,"Well, you could also ask how many extra cases would Sweden find, if they tested 4-5 times more?"
2128,&gt; Vitamin D also requires some fat intake as well.

2156,"It’s not hiding in your room because you’re shy, it’s laughing when a toddler scrapes their knee and starts crying because you pushed them and your heart is a shriveled coal."

2207,It’s not right wing/conservatism.
2208,It’s dominance.
2209,I’d say you can be a conservative/right wing and not be authoritarian.
2210,The problem today is people are mislabeling people of both parties with characteristics of those in the minority.

2344,It's like how we are testing where I live.
2345,You can now only test if you have symptoms or have been in contact with someone who has Covid.

2369,You really want the state to go around micro managing how everybody lives their lives at an individual daily level?
2370,The size of the police force you’d need for that would be staggering
2371,Other countries are going through the same shit and they handled it a lot better (some worse of course) than we did overall because of government policy.
2372,Like most of Eastern Asia’s been back to normal despite higher population density since April because everyone understood the consequences and politicians weren’t encouraging people to go maskless or drink bleach.

2376,"No one else cared, state borders weren’t closed, and there was no preventative action taken by both the government nor the people despite KNOWING the effects and transmission rates of COVID."
2377,"There was SARS in the 2000s and we had a pandemic team already in place, which was disbanded.. so I dunno, seems like policy failure and people being inconsiderate to me."
2378,"Sure, you have old people getting infected at nursing homes and prisoners getting COVID unfairly, but why’s the virus spreading in the first place?"
2379,Because half the country can’t just stay the fuck at home and not meet people.
2380,"If we would’ve went on an immediate lockdown as soon as we knew about COVID and wearing masks, testing, and healthcare weren’t bipartisan issues, then we would’ve been good."
2381,People who can’t just stay home because they want to see friends or who don’t wear masks because it’s inconvenient are absolute dickheads and there’s no victim blaming there.
2382,Like you actually have to be an inconsiderate shit to put your family’s or roommates’ health at risk because you can’t stay the fuck home.

2451,If younger people are getting infected then the death toll will be lower.
2452,also important to note that while US cases are rising dramatically it's not totally fair to compare them to March/Aprils figures due to just how little the US was testing back in March.
2453,We we're likely getting alot more cases back then compared to the official numbers but due to how difficult it was to even get a test we missed alot of cases

2495,:)
2496,Can't wait to see the T-cell brigade into this one as well.
2497,Quick review though which is that Memory B-cells are the ones responsible for neutralizing antibodies.
2498,"Neutralizing antibodies are the chemicals responsible for sterilizing immunity, which is the immunity that people think of as ""immunity""."
2499,T-cells are split into CD4+ helper T-cells (which are responsible for activating other immune responses) and to cytotoxic killer CD8+ lymphocytes.
2500,"Those CD8+ T-cells do not attack virus particles like neutralizing antibodies, but attack infected cells that are pumping out virions."
2501,"What is important there is that T-cells are a line of defense that only responds to already-infected cells, which means there's an active infection."
2502,Neutralizing antibodies prevent infection in the first place.
2503,"So, the widely mentioned study that SARS-CoV-2 infected patients had detectable T-cell immune responses 17 years later does not contradict the headline study here in the UK, and does not mean that those patients would have had sterilizing immunity and would be immune to reinfection."
2504,"We expect with this coronavirus, as with other coronaviruses that memory B-cells ""forget"" over time and that on a 12-24 month timeframe people will become prone to reinfection."
2505,"With seasonal coronavirus sterilizing immunity begins to wane after 6 months, after 12 months about 50% of people have lost immunity and after 24 months nearly everyone has lost immunity."
2506,Because COVID-19 is a more severe disease it may produce more lasting immune responses in people that have been hospitalized.
2507,"We expect vaccines to produce initially strong B-cell responses similar to convalescent ICU patients and strong initial sterilizing immunity, but expect it to be lost over time, which is why experts have always stated that vaccines for SARS-CoV-2 would need yearly booster shots."
2508,"There will be at least some T-cell responses produced by the vaccine, but vaccines are expected to produce more B-cell than T-cell responses, another reason why booster shots will be necessary."
2509,We do not know which vaccines produce strong T-cell responses and since we only have about a month of data on vaccines in humans we can't say how long any initial T-cell responses will persist.
2510,The CD4+/CD8+ responses to the virus which do persist are what will eventually turn the disease into the common cold.
2511,"They will not prevent reinfection, but will blunt the disease."
2512,"CD8+ T-cells will get a jumpstart on killing infected cells and CD4+ helpers will spin up the immune response and start to stimulate production of B-cells and neutralizing antibodies again, and the course of the disease will look more like the common cold and less like COVID-19."
2513,"The 2009 H1N1 pandemic influenza is a good example of this where cross-reactive T-cells to pre-1957 H1 envelope protein (from the 1918 H1N1 pandemic, which became seasonal influenza until 1957 when it was displaced by H2N2) protected older people so that the 2009 H1N1 was nowhere near as severe."
2514,"Older people still got infected, still got sick, still could transmit the disease, but they didn't wind up in the hospital/ICU and dying by the thousands."
2515,BUT immunity isn't a binary on/off switch and there's levels of immunity.
2516,"Sterilizing immunity is what is necessary for herd immunity, and sterilizing immunity will be somewhat fleeting for this virus, and you don't get it from T-cells."
2517,This is about stereotyping or not.
2518,This is so not good news.
2519,"This is how people end up with heart failure, diabetes, etc., after viruses."
2520,yeah i love wearing a mask because i can be emotionless and not have to fake smile to strangers
2521,The infection rates of the school population are DOUBLE than those of the general population by the same data from 2 weeks ago.

2529,The fatality statistics have been proven to be hyper-inflated.
2530,Why?
2531,To generate fear.
2532,Not only that but PCR tests are highly innacurate.
2533,"Media is only talking about cases, to generate fear."
2534,"It's obvious when you take a step back and see all of this for what it really is, a great big scam."
2535,Drugs are a 90% failure rate.
2536,"I would disagree, fauci has stated that the Vaccine should be widely available by March/April, which is well before summer."
2537,"By summer, everyone should be vaccinated."
2538,We're not meantioning the huge desert in the middle?
2539,Probably because those other restrictions actually do something
2540,Lets hope!
2541,Deaths per capita in almost all major EU countries have overtaken the US now.
2542,"Last I checked, anti-masker isn't a protected category, nor is jerk."
2543,"That, and masks aren't political."
2544,They are an IQ test.
2545,And I won't hire people who lack the intelligence or frankly the empathy to wear them.
2546,"&gt;In my Canadian home town, almost all the smaller private restaurants have closed down

Well that's obviously terrible, but I was directly referring to the **1 hour** that restaurants have to close early now."
2547,&gt;This is really dismissive to people who have been seriously affected by lockdowns.
2548,"Again, I was directly stating people who got upset over having to wear a mask."
2549,"Not people concerned about lockdown issues, or not being able to work."
2550,"Well Australia is a continent, not an island, but that's not really relevant."
2551,What's more relevant is that Australia is very urbanised - more urbanised in fact than the UK and the USA.

2553,&gt; That's a big number.
2554,Deaths have been rising about 50% per week in France (7-day rolling average per worldmeters).
2555,"I think this means the delay from testing to death is dropping - France used to have about a 30-day delay (higher is better, basically), but cases 30 days ago were only rising 20% per week."
2556,Absofuckinglutely.
2557,in what interpretation is this good news?
2558,it's not even good news for the virus.
2559,I am from italy and bars and restaurants reopened may 18th.
2560,Schools reopened between sept 17th and 24th.
2561,This should be enough to show what is driving the second wave.
2562,And it's not someone seated outside eating or having a beer.
2563,In addition to brusaferro and others admitting finally schools played a major role why is the government closing high schools and universities?
2564,Because they are obviously part of the problem.
2565,Because to force 7 million students to go to school is dangerous.
2566,Expecially if they use public transportation at rush hours and if they are mostly asymptomatic.
2567,So yes i am italian and finally people are speaking up.
2568,Reopening schools like the government did was a huge mistake.
2569,RIP to the economy.
2570,"This is the equivalent to the United States hitting the following:

2572,Nah.
2573,"Only if they're women typically, and are in a previously heavily Red-held state."
2574,Maryland has had pretty stringent mask policies earlier than most states and opened on a 3 phase basis.
2575,Hogan never got the terrorist plots.
2576,"But, he's also a republican in a deep democratic state."
2577,He's just not the type of republican that toes the Trump  line or any other politician for that matter.
2578,"you won't really feel any different because vitamin d is used more for bone creation and also for your immune system so really what it means is you're less likely to fall and break something easily (such as with osteoporosis), and also you won't get your ass laid out by bugs as much as people who are deficient (which may be the case with COVID)."
2579,"[Some people have found that their anxiety also decreased significantly after they brought their vitamin D levels up to a healthy level](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11011-019-00486-1)

so vitamin D is more like a silent helper than an ""oh man I feel amazing now that I'm taking vitamin d""."
2580,"Good to have good levels of, but you'll only feel it because you won't feel the negative impact of *not* having it if that makes sense."
2581,It's absolutely pathetic that a state like WI can have more cases than its more dense and populated neighbor.
2582,I didn't take it that way.
2583,"I think downvotes might reflect generalized disgust at recent comments from Mark Meadows, the White House Chief of Staff, who said they're not even trying to control to spread anymore and are focussing on vaccines and therapeutics."
2584,So any animosity aimed at your karma likely has more to do with the current context than anything you said.
2585,"I'm all for going all in to reign in the spread, but also appreciate that a vaccine would be really nice to have."
2586,"The media started a concerted effort at making the approval date an issue - NPR, WaPo, NBC/ABC/CBS all making it a story at the same time."
2587,"The FDA put the new rule in place a couple weeks after that, and the rule was an arbitrary number that accomplished only pushing approval past Nov 3."
2588,"Now, if you are looking for a memo from the FDA saying ""we only made this decision based on political pressure"", yeah that won't happen."
2589,But the chain of events is obvious.
2590,If you are looking
2591,"Unfortunately, you are wrong."
2592,The people getting sick and dying are sacrificing so people like you can go to Applebee's and get haircuts.
2593,That's just a hard truth about this.
2594,It's still not hard to wear a mask.
2595,"it's really, really easy."
2596,It's not a detriment.
2597,It's not a sacrifice.
2598,It doesn't change anything.
2599,The majority of redditors aren't getting a vaccine before next summer at the earliest.
2600,"As a college student, that wont be happening."
2601,They have to take advantage of those subsidized lunches.
2602,"But, yes, I agree completely with you."
2603,I moved here a week before the last lockdown and have eaten inside 3 times since the last lockdown ended and that was during off-peak times and all places had the doors/windows open with good breezes.
2604,You won't catch me eating in a restaurant with these people who have no clue about personal space.
2605,I'm thankful for it every day.
2606,Yeah and Pfizer have said they are investigating if it can be stored at higher temperatures.
2607,"I think they're currently citing how they handle it during normal laboratory conditions but it's possible requirements can be less stringent, they just don't know yet and are not taking any chances."
2608,Also they have already said it can be kept at normal refrigeration temps for up to 5 days.
2609,It's only for storage it needs to be very cold.
2610,Is there point with this rambling?

2617,"&gt;In an article today in Yahoo Finance, Richard Hughes, the managing director and vaccines leader at Avalere, a DC-based health care consultancy weighed in on the legality of such a mandate."
2618,Hughes cited the political challenge with a state or federal mandate but asserts the same laws provide freedom for employers and schools to require their employees and students to be vaccinated.
2619,"According to the article, Farley Cleghorn, a physician and global health practice head at consultancy Palladium, “Countries can legally mandate vaccination to cross borders, as with yellow fever, and schools from kindergarten to universities can legally require vaccination for entry, as in much of the world for the expanded program of immunization and with limited medical exemptions....If a vaccine is developed, employers may be able to require employees to become vaccinated and will have to evaluate accommodations for religious beliefs and/or disabilities,""

It will be similar to how masks are being mandated now, businesses and schools can deny entry for those who aren't vaccinated."
2620,At the federal and state level it's a very dicey issue that i'm sure will be challenged in court.
2621,"Not the place for it, y'all."

2646,"If its in politics/news then yea, you got a foot to stand on."
2647,"I would say 

Womp... Womp😑"
2648,There is a lockdown a week before and after the testing.
2649,"Only the negative ones will be allowed to leave their homes, while still following all the measures (mask, distance, hygiene...), so if a big majority attends the testing, there should be smaller chance to catch it."

2664,Belgium is in a terrible position.
2665,"Not enough beds, nowhere to send patients out of the country and asking infected health care workers to work."
2666,Completely agree but without federal support it can't and won't happen.
2667,Normal people are afraid of losing everything because they can't pay their bills during another lockdown.
2668,That stimulus *really* needs to happen for a shutdown to be feasible.
2669,The draconian measures in Victoria are brought up far less compare to welding gates in China.
2670,Both are rare events.
2671,Yet one (Australia) is brought up far less than the other (China).

2679,"That's a very good point that I had forgotten, and hadn't considered."
2680,Wendover did a really good video about this and how logistics for it would work.
2681,Something like for that to work you can only open so many times a day (say 3) and have to plan exactly how many vaccines you'll need.
2682,For places like africa it is extremely difficult going village to village and having just the right amount of vaccines available .
2683,I know my explanation didn't do it justice but it was pretty eye opening about how difficult it would be to vaccinate globally.

2697,[This](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.10.21.20217174v1) is the actual study.

2712,Nobody ever thought it would be 0
2713,What liberties do you mean?
2714,For the vast vast vast majority of Americans all of that is completely doable... crime in the US is hugely a regional problem.
2715,Small areas of major cities inflate over all averages by huge amounts.
2716,The per capita GDP of US citizens is TEN FUCKING TIMES higher than China and 92% of our citizens have health care coverage.
2717,It's only 3% higher in China and the quality of healthcare pales in comparison.
2718,"We have the highest 5 year cancer survival rate in the world by a significant buffer, the best medical devices, the best medicine available anywhere, shit this year we've sent thousands of ventilator all over the world this year because we were able to produce them to such excess and never turned a single person in need of one away..."
2719,"LOL, Japan didn't do shit."
2720,Most people have been back in the office and packing bars and restaurants for months.
2721,"The ""lockdown,"" along with the government's facade of contact tracing, were a half-assed pantomime."
2722,"It's less of an issue here because people are less inclined towards physical contact than Westerners are, but more importantly, eat far healthier diets and are much much less likely to have comorbidities that drive up the chances of serious infections and death."
2723,"Certainly not due to ""leadership,"" something that doesn't exist here."
2724,People don't care about each other here.
2725,They mostly go out of their way to pretend others don't exist the same way government leadership doesn't.
2726,NZ is an absurd basis for comparison for innumerable reasons.
2727,"Note that you aren't mentioning all the other countries, mostly in Europe, that this sub was lavishing with praise just a few months ago for doing everything right, because their cases started skyrocketing as soon as restrictions were eased."
2728,Exactly as lockdown skeptics predicted.
2729,The gap in care &amp; education  poor parents can provide compared to rich parents is the smallest it’s been in the last 30 years.
2730,Covid is hitting less fortunate  people harder than the rich and now the gap care these parents can provide is widening again.

We were naive about our expectations of the US government back then."
2741,A higher percentage of black people get shot than white people.
2742,Yes looking purely at numbers you are correct but when you adjust them for the appropriate percent of population statistically black people are shot in higher numbers.
2743,&gt; Faust and his colleagues examined the data released by the US Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and found that in 2020 the number of deaths from all causes among young people to the end of July this year was a quarter higher than the same period last year.
2744,"The 14,155 excessive deaths had a peak rise in May, but only a small fraction were attributed directly to the coronavirus."
2745,"This implies “the mortality of Covid-19 has been substantially underdetected in the younger adult population,” they said."
2746,Does this researcher believe we are undercounting US covid deaths in young adults by over 100%?
2747,I can certainly think of some other things this would imply that isn't that.
2748,Would have been nice if this article bothered to link the research it discussed.
2749,No they didn't.
2750,This would be front page news if it w as even  5%

2752,It's never too late.
2753,"It's amusing to see, like you said, people fighting for and against masks and lockdowns, when these in isolation are not ways to solve simple things like an outbreak."
2754,"The problem is people wanting a single magic silver bullet that will solve their problems, governments not communicating clearly that this is not possible and instead a Swiss cheese defense is needed, and the other side that does not believe in either a magic bullet or that the virus is real."
2755,The next battleground will be vaccines.
2756,And will be for the next year or so until it's over.
2757,Same here.

2760,"&gt; distance learning is an absolute mess

first of all, I'm a teacher and I can tell you it is NOT a mess."
2761,"Now, it does *not* replace teaching a child while in the room with them."
2762,"&amp;nbsp;

And yes, it is more difficult to help students, especially the ones in need."
2763,"&amp;nbsp;

Every day, there's new things implemented to try and reach out to these kids (and all kids)."
2764,The quality of the education will not be the same during distance learning.
2765,It WILL NOT.
2766,But to make it seem as if no one is learning or the ones that need the extra help will completely bottom out...nah.
2767,Kids will learn.
2768,Many at lower levels than in-school.
2769,Some at higher levels (I've really had some kids completely blast off during this time).
2770,Some will be stuck.
2771,There are kids that barely did anything while in school and now are doing even less.
2772,"With all kids, we reach out as much as possible."
2773,"If someone is disengaged, we reach out to the parents."
2774,Set up as many ways of communication as possible.

At the end of the day, there's only so much we can do, while in-school or distance learning."
2776,"As Trump said, it is what it is."
2777,**Everyone is living with this pandemic for the foreseeable future**.
2778,"IF no effective vaccines are out there in 2021, it'll come time to decide what to do because this method is not sustainable long-term."
2779,"However, during an emergency and pandemic, I think distance learning is sustainable for a year or so."
2780,"I'd give it this whole school year, depending on how the vaccines and medications come out."
2781,"If meds (like the one the president got) and vaccines pass trials and are super effective, maybe my February or March we can start filling back in."
2782,"If it takes a little longer, Maybe next school year."
2783,"&amp;nbsp;

It isn't just the kids that are losing out in this situation."
2784,"And it is no fault of theirs, the parents, the teacher, the schools, the city, or the country."
2785,This is just a reality.
2786,Its a pandemic.
2787,"It is a highly infectious virus that kills people that are older, anyone that is not in tip top shape, or might have a pre-existing condition like diabetes or anything that doesn't put your body at 100%."

2812,"All these points are right as far as  they go, but they don’t go far enough."
2813,"The biggest cost of the trade war  — measured in lives lost, lingering business uncertainty and a longer  economic downturn — is the lack of cooperation between the U.S. and  China on vaccines and other biomedical advances."
2814,"&gt;  
&gt;Consider the U.S.  position."
2815,"Since it’s impossible to know which vaccines for Covid-19  will be safest and most effective until the clinical trials are further  along and other studies have been made, the federal government has made  advance [purchases](https://www.hhs.gov/coronavirus/explaining-operation-warp-speed/index.html)  of seven vaccines."
2816,"By pre-purchasing a portfolio of vaccines, the U.S.  can ensure that when the time comes to ramp up production, the companies  will be ready."
2817,"&gt;  
&gt;The current portfolio is multinational, including investments  in Pfizer, Sanofi, AstraZeneca and Johnson &amp; Johnson."
2818,"Ideally,  there should be at least one Chinese vaccine included, but there is not."
2819,"&gt;  
&gt;Obviously, given the rhetoric of the current administration,  using a Chinese vaccine would be politically difficult."
2820,You can’t call  it “the Chinese virus” and then tell Americans they ought to take a  Chinese vaccine.
2821,So the Trump administration has made no serious effort  to make a vaccine-sharing deal with China.
2822,"&gt;  
&gt;Early in the process, some U.S. observers went so far as to sneer  at the Chinese vaccine efforts."
2823,But to date they have been impressive.
2824,"China has made the fastest progress of any nation, and it has several  vaccine contenders, with [four products](https://www.ft.com/content/ce9a4c98-49b5-4c24-9ff2-ed1c6a3f3412) now in Stage 3 trials."
2825,"&gt;

2826,"The United Arab Emirates also is in the midst of testing the BBIBP-CorV vaccine in a Phase 3 trial, with results expected soon, just as China itself is actively testing the products."
2827,One recent [paper](https://www.thelancet.com/journals/laninf/article/PIIS1473-3099(20)30832-X/fulltext) in the medical journal The Lancet indicated a result of “promising”  and also sufficiently safe.
2828,"The matter is hardly settled, but at the  very least the Chinese vaccines are not dropping out of contention."
2829,"&gt;  
&gt;China  is already administering those vaccines to its military and to some  employees of state-owned enterprises."
2830,The U.S. typically would be more  cautious.
2831,"But China, with its extensive information-gathering  capabilities, is effectively conducting its Stage 3 trial in public, and  at an accelerated pace."
2832,"Whether or not you agree with that policy,  Americans in principle can benefit because it is China is taking all the  risk and generating the information."
2833,"&gt;  
&gt;Another advantage of the  Chinese vaccines is that they are designed for quick production and  rapid scalability."
2834,That could be helpful even if in purely biomedical  terms they are not the most potent products.
2835,"&gt;  
&gt;In all fairness,  there is no guarantee that the U.S. would have been able to strike a  vaccine deal with China even if Trump were not president and there were  no trade war."
2836,"Still, the Chinese have been very active making advance  sales of their vaccines abroad, often attempting to extract geopolitical  concessions as well."
2837,"China also just [signed up](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-10-09/china-joins-who-s-global-coronavirus-vaccine-program?sref=EP6bV7CS) for Covax, the vaccine-sharing multilateral arrangement."
2838,The U.S. still has not joined.
2839,"&gt;  
&gt;The U.S. should not offer international concessions in return  for a claim to Chinese vaccines."
2840,But it is quite possible China would  be open to a cash deal.
2841,"China could also obtain the rights to buy some  U.S. vaccines, thus reducing risk on both sides, as a kind of mutual  insurance contract."
2842,"&gt;  
&gt;It would probably qualify as a humbling  propaganda defeat if America turned out to need a Chinese vaccine."
2843,"But  eating a little crow would be a small price to pay for a useful vaccine,  given the immense damage wrought by Covid-19."
2844,"&gt;  
&gt;At a faster pace  than most people would have thought possible, China has become a major  player in the biomedical sciences."
2845,"Trade with China isn’t just about  iPhones, soybeans and plastic toys at Walmart."
2846,"These days, it is also a  matter of life and death."
2847,Maybe few Americans knew that when the trade  war started.
2848,But one of the very virtues of trade that it creates  valuable opportunities that are hard to foresee.

Past research has attributed income-based inequalities in young children’s academic achievement and educational attainment in part to differences in the home environment; that is, to differences in what parents do and the goals that drive their behavior."
2894,"However, in our studies using data on parenting behavior and parental goals over the past 30 years, we found that income-based differences in parenting have been steadily decreasing."
2895,"For instance, since the mid-1980s, low income parents have greatly increased the time they spend in enrichment with young children, such as reading to them, telling them stories, and taking them to the library."
2896,"And, when we look at parents’ goals for children, we see a complete convergence in trends over time, such that high and low income parents today are equally likely to value children’s ‘thinking for themselves’ and ‘working hard’ over ‘being obedient,’ a trait low-income parents consistently rated as more important than higher income parents throughout the 20th."
2897,"Convergence in parenting trends over time

Consequently, economically advantaged and disadvantaged parents of young children share more similar parenting behaviors and goals today than ever before."
2902,There is some evidence these changes are benefitting young children too –Reardon and Portilla find that test score gaps between kindergartners at the top and bottom of the income distribution narrowed in the first 20 years of the 21st century after increasing from the 1970s to 2000.

The COVID-19 crisis, and the economic and social restrictions that followed it, threaten that progress."
2904,"The pandemic has exacerbated inequalities in families’ economic, health and educational resources that will tax low-income parents’ ability to pursue and realize their goals."
2905,"Decades of research describes the toll taken by job loss, income instability, and material hardship on parent mental health, parent-child interaction, and children’s development and we can see in emerging data from the pandemic that these phenomena remain true today."
2906,Our respective research teams have been following hundreds of low-income families with young children from before the onset of the pandemic through this spring after its onset.
2907,"One of these longitudinal studies is of 272 predominantly Latinx families of elementary school children in rural Pennsylvania, and the other is of 314 predominantly Black and Latinx families of preschoolers in Chicago."
2908,"Despite the differences in demographics, emerging evidence from families surveyed between April and June of this year shows striking similarities in the ways in which three pillars of parenting – economic stability, parental mental health, and support for children’s learning – have been shaken."
2909,"In rural Pennsylvania, for example, we found a substantial increase in the share of parents who worried they would run out of food before they could afford to buy more, just as parents’ reports of daily worry and depression increased steadily from February to May 2020."
2910,"In Chicago, we similarly found that the share of families who reported struggling to make ends meet nearly doubled, from 13% to 23% from last fall to this spring."
2911,"Not surprisingly, these same parents reported a substantial increase in their levels of stress."
2912,"Disruptions in parent-child interaction are also apparent: Among parents in Pennsylvania, the share of parents who reported losing their temper with their children on any given day increased by 60 percent from February to May."
2913,"In Chicago, the share of parents who agreed with the statement “I feel overwhelmed by the responsibility of being a parent” rose significantly from 8.9% last fall to 14.3% this spring."
2914,Stocks are up almost 30% off late March lows.
2915,"This current recession/depression is worse than 2008 with no end in sight, because neither the US nor Europe look like they are beating Covid any time soon, and without fixing the health issue, there is no economic recovery."
2916,The only reason I can think of that stocks are high is because of the trillions of stimulus that's been injected to prop up a zombie economy that will remain dead until Covid is over.
2917,For 4 to 6 months.
2918," *long term effects has been renamed to ""unsubstantiated fearmongering""*"
2919,Haven't they already revealed that the guy who died had the placebo?
2920,"Presumably they are able to check individuals status, and I wonder if they might do that when someone gets the virus (rather than only when they die)"
2921,"they got a grant to run a study on this topic, most likely because of reports of surface transmission on frozen food packaging."
2922,"i'm not sure what in the fuck this has to do with ""wishful thinking and unfounded soothing"""
2923,Didn't Trump just issue an executive order allowing him to fire Fauci for disloyalty?
2924,The timeliness of Fauci's statement that a vaccine is going to be ready soon sounds suspicious now.
2925,He's just trying to keep  his job.
2926,"It's [here](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.10.21.20217174v1), if you'd like to read it."
2927,I don't have time at the moment so would love to hear thoughts.
2928,SCMP's science reporting is historically............. lackluster.
2929,Edit to add: Including (maybe) intentionally never directly linking their sources.
2930,According to the figures on worldometer the US is over 230k deaths now vs 250k of Europe.
2931,But then the whole of Europe has a bigger population.
2932,"North America is less populated than Europe, it has ~345k deaths for a better comparison."
2933,Exactly.
2934,People criticize giving the government more power but there are some major benefits.
2935,When the government is more controlling crime drops significantly.
2936,This is why we need to vote Trumps and the rest of the fascists out.
2937,The GOP wants too much control of our lives.
2938,We need to give that control to people we can trust like the Democrats instead and then outlaw the GOP.
2939,Priorities
2940,It’s not a fallacy that political appointees are in their jobs for reasons other than competency.
2941,Most of those Asian countries achieved their success through a level of government control that would be almost laughably implausible in freedom-loving USA.
2942,"Heck, even here in Australia there were protest against basic policies such as social distancing and mandatory mask wearing; fortunately they were too small to affect the response as a whole."
2943,I'm replying to the guy who got 100+ upvotes by implying the vaccine trial involves checking if people get infected.
2944,I work in education and it is truly awful that some students just can't seem to find the will to attend school and get work done.
2945,It isn't necessarily a parental problem in that they have to go to work while their child stays at home.
2946,I just communicated with a father (who doesn't live with his son) that had to take away his son's Xbox because he was playing it during class.
2947,"It is a great time for students to learn self control and self motivation, but there are some students who truly won't get any work done because they don't have a teacher next to them, in class, nagging them to do what is in front of them."
2948,"On top of that, there was already a push to not give homework because it isn't a useful metric if they just go home and half your class doesn't do it (in certain areas)."
2949,"That being said, I do have very successful students."
2950,All it takes is to just attend class and do the assignments.
2951,"I don't get why they think that lol, Fauci's been there for decades under many other presidents, red or blue."
2952,But apparently advocating for masks and staying safe during a pandemic is immediately politically controversial to them
2953,Thank you for putting the health of others above your own comfort.
2954,Selflessness seems pretty hard to come by these days.
2955,"I don't feel the second mask as much as I do the second rubber, I'll say that much"
2956,"Holy fuck, how do they have time for that right now?"
2957,They really don't care about the people do they...
2958,I work in healthcare so I will be among the first to get a vaccine.
2959,I will be throwing my masks away once I get the vaccine.
2960,I always thought it was Greg or Gary
2961,"bruh fr, me too."

2964,"From what I can gather she is a talking duck of some sort, which is quite impressive."
2965,Hope for a swift recovery.

2967,You can control the restrictions.
2968,You don't have to agree to them if you don't want to.
2969,Majority of them allows you to use the app still (most games anyway).
2970,If you read carefully it even allows you to restrict specific things.
2971,"Like contacts, location etc... - *this is for android only*, not sure about iOS"
2972,Victorian here.
2973,Fucken oath.
2974,I live in regional Vic in a shire which has has had 1 case ever.
2975,We had still had a pretty strict lockdown but not close to what my Melbourne brothers and sisters have endured.
2976,"Our leader backed the science and refused to be swayed by aggressive conservative media and look at that, it worked!"
2977,It looks very likely that I'll be able to see my family for xmas (they live in another state) and that we will be having a relatively normal summer.
2978,My business is booming again and fast making up for any losses made during lockdown.
2979,Its almost like we are back at the start of March except now we know a truckload more and our tracing systems in place are top notch.
2980,Very proud.
2981,[deleted]
2982,So vaccines won’t work?
2983,"Once the world has achieved herd immunity, I imagine the night clubbers will make out with random strangers in packed night clubs to celebrate the end of the pandemic."
2984,"Also, here is the COVID Tracking Project’s Hospitalization information:

[Total currently hospitalized for the US](https://covidtracking.com/data/charts/us-currently-hospitalized)

[Hospitalizations broken down by region](https://covidtracking.com/data/charts/regional-current-hospitalizations)

[Hospitalizations broken down by state](https://covidtracking.com/data/charts/currently-hospitalized-by-state)

Seeing this data along with OP's article provides a compelling and alarming picture for where we are headed, especially with the onset of winter soon."
2985,I’m pretty sure in-person learning is going strong in Ballard school district.
2986,Think about tours and entertainment.
2987,People absolutely miss live music.
2988,We will probably still need precautions like social distancing and masks even after the vaccine is being distributed as the vaccine may not be super effective (like the flu shot being 60ish percent effective).
2989,Aussie here.
2990,I think you are underestimating the Canadian winter.
2991,"Even if, as you say, the increase in winter spread is due to people spending more time indoors, then you'll find Canadians spend more of their winter indoors."
2992,"Australians, even Victorians and Tasmanians, spend more time outdoors during winter than Canadians do."
2993,Australian school kids eat their lunch sitting on the ground with a jumper on in winter.
2994,That could kill a kid in Canada.
2995,Surprised a GOOD NEWS post wasn’t upvoted more on this sub
2996,I went to the movies on Friday.
2997,Global warming is helping out greatly as well.
2998,&gt; It’s also something of an open secret that the phase III trials have going swimmingly.
2999,I wish more people understood this!
3000,The fact that more and more world governments are placing orders for the vaccine &amp; the trials are expanding is AMAZING news.
3001,"They're not just taking a stab at the dark with where they throw their money, multiple first world governments are pouring over Oxford's (and Moderna's and Pfizer's) data and really like what they're seeing."
3002,"(french here with bad English)
School reopen with only one purpose: allow parents to go to work again."
3003,Too many small and medium business are now definitely closed.
3004,And partial un-employement aid is too costly for government.
3005,Don't forget the freedom to buy the organs stolen from those who critize the government or pooh bear!
3006,"I've always wanted to visit, I've heard great stories!"
3007,I just don't know the geography.
3008,"Also, don't wreck my dreams that you all are Crocodile Dundee!!!!"

3012,"&gt;Pro athletes signing big contracts have to go through a huge battery of medical tests that the contract is contingent upon

3013,Professional athletes are hired on a contractual basis based on performance.
3014,"&gt;Pilots have a large list of disqualifying medical conditions

They get cleared by their doctor, in most cases these conditions only have to be well controlled."
3015,If you're doctor certifies you the employer can not ask if you have any of these conditions.
3016,To them not having any looks the same as having one that's well controlled.
3017,Ours cost about 1800 bucks each.
3018,"There's gonna be a random weekend in 2023 when you'll be traveling to Europe and I'll be arguing with the sales lady at Sephora and some other guy will be freely strolling a bookstore, and the COVID restrictions will randomly pop into our heads and we'll be like ""damn that was a nightmare, thank god it's over"" and continue on with our lives."
3019,"I am confused, and not trying to put any other area down."
3020,"I know a lot of people in medicine, none of them say they are overwhelmed or can’t handle the patients."
3021,What is going on here?
3022,Well that’s fracking wonderful...
3023,Thanks.
3024,I really hope that the _death_ count is not dependent on the amount of testing though.
3025,"Clearly the number of _cases_ is, but deaths usually receive more scrutiny."
3026,Cant have multiple waves if you just have onehuge wave *tips head*
3027,"The point in distinction between the first and second wave, is that the second wave is always way worse."
3028,"The point of him saying its still the first wave, is actually fauci saying "" you aint seen nothing yet"""
3029,Most people are over it and aren't really scared of covid anymore.

3036,anything between that and the ones that cost thousands?
3037,They are calling it second wave in Canada.
3038,Why?
3039,The experience with SARS definitely helped.
3040,My mom was at the front line when SARS hit China.
3041,I vividly remember the days when I had to stay with other family because her job and my dad's recently travelling home was too dangerous for me.
3042,Also her hospital started too work on some sort of procedures to separate patients with fever from other patients.
3043,"As school kids, we had to wear facemasks (the old cotton fabric) and report our temperature everyday."
3044,"This time with covid-19, I see (or more like hear) them adopting those nearly 20 year old protocols quickly with stuff like my mom who still has fairly fresh memory (and fear) from SARS."
3045,Although I have to add that many medical workers are actually criticising the hospitals and CDCs for not reacting prompt enough as they already have experience with SARS.
3046,What happens now is that the CDC is under re-form to establish an emergency system to provide fast detection and reaction in the future.
3047,"If it were only 20%, Covid would be gone already."
3048,The one hour of exercise is one example of the honor system.
3049,"Another is the ""bubble"" of contacts you have to choose."
3050,You are only allowed one other person in your bubble.
3051,That even applies to your parents.
3052,I happen to know so many people were following that from my contacts and that was incredibly surprising.
3053,"There was a video of people welding one door, for all we know it was only one of several entrances"
3054,Fauci has shown he doesn't know what he's talking about.
3055,He refused to criticize Democratic governors for encouraging people to go to BLM protests over the summer.
3056,We shouldn't be listening to him anymore.
3057,Musicians and athletes?
3058,Can I ask why?
3059,Hope this guy dies all alone and then shunned by his loved ones for not being strong enough to beat the virus like Donnie Fat Fuck
3060,I've only found one since the pandemic started for business and I wore an n95 mask which I didn't take off the entire flight.
3061,An international flight where meal service is offered would be a no-go.
3062,I had no idea that 90% of these Hong Kong cases being reported were imported cases.
3063,That makes me feel a lot better about the state of things in HK.
3064,I couldn't understand why it was still getting these numbers everyday.
3065,"You're not wrong, why we elect the leaders we elect and what they do is a multifaceted thing but if you think racism isn't a major driver in our politics I'd recommend some serious reading and hard thinking."
3066,"Every time tough on crime president has essentially been promising to the keep the ""scary black people away""."
3067,"Any social reform that strips social safety nets is ok because ""those lazy Blacks shouldn't be sponging off the government."""
3068,Hell a lot of these restrictions on the first amendment have specifically been about keeping Black people from protesting in the 1960s.
3069,These restrictions weaken the individual citizenry and give the government way too much power but there is a large segment of our population that is ok with anything as long as it keeps Black people from parity.
3070,"And until we confront that we're never going to be able to achieve things like universal healthcare, or enriching social infrastructure."
3071,"&gt;  I didn't finish my taxes in time to get mine

Canada has you signing up online quickly and easily."
3072,"No questions asked $1400 dollars a month (more if you have a family) no hoops nothing, completely independent of your employer."
3073,"Also they have better healthcare which is not coming out of that check, important during a pandemic."
3074,"Stimulus packages around the world:

UK: 80% of workers' salaries

Denmark: 75% of workers' salaries

S Korea: 70% of workers' salaries

Netherlands: 90% of workers' salaries

Canada: $2k per month

Australia: $1k per month

US: One time $1200 check that may take months to arrive


&gt;Before the coronavirus epidemic, the U.S. average for unemployment benefits was $378 a week, although the amount and duration of actual benefits vary from state to state."
3075,"As an illustration: While Mississippi, the state with the lowest unemployment benefits, offered citizens an average of $213 a week, Massachusetts, the state with the highest, provided an average of $555 a week."
3076,"&gt;The CARES Act added $600 a week to existing state benefits through the end of July, significantly boosting unemployment benefits in every state."
3077,But most Americans may be waiting until they receive these benefits as many states have had trouble quickly processing the hundreds of thousands of unemployment claims coming in each week.
3078,"&gt;So while the international numbers below provide some insight into how other countries are helping soften the economic blow for newly unemployed workers, it's not quite accurate to say that American workers are simply receiving less than their international counterparts."
3079,The full death report for the year released by the CDC will be available next year.
3080,"These reports are widely used for various statistical models and policies, and cannot be hidden even with reshuffling the cause of death to another category."
3081,"When a person dies, it goes to so many records from SSA, to master death index, to county courts, and so on that the paper trail is sufficient enough to see the full impact of the mortality rate due covid and everything else in 2020."
3082,"Good, more dumb motherfuckers need to die."
3083,Die die die you old racist fucks
3084,Yes
3085,Shame it’s affecting Black people so much.
3086,Hope the tide turns and more racist hicks start dropping like flies.
3087,There is no evidence that California’s first or subsequent lockdown has been of the caliber of those I detailed.
3088,Movement of people has been relatively in constrained.

3501,This is turning into a rant.
3502,"We did the same thing but when social media have people in Canada thinking that we're losing our freedoms and that fascist communists are taking over, it's hard."
3503,Even our version of Trump here told people to stay home but they would rather listen to Trump and his gang rather than our own politicians.
3504,"Fucksake, I work in government."

3508,"We're taking transit, visiting others, cramming into offices."
3509,Our numbers keep going up and we keep opening things up.
3510,We also are supposed to limit gatherings to 6 people.
3511,We were all working at home fine but we have to show that we're in offices proved that we are working.
3512,I wrote policies for 2 brand new laws in 6 months this year.
3513,This is more work that I've done in 3 years.
3514,All due to being at home to just focus on working and research.
3515,And none of it accounts for just how damaging racism is to the souls and spirits of people.

3627,The Governor's who allow their states and city's to host such large gatherings that some call riots and some call peaceful protests are the same states that are also dealing with increased numbers in cases.
3628,California for example.

3680,But it clearly didn't.
3681,"If it had, Japan wouldn't have gone from double-digit cases when that article was published to just shy of [2,000 a day](https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/country/japan/) over the summer."
3682,They didn't contain shit.
3683,"And your own article bears out what I've been saying all along:

*Meanwhile, the government never made testing the priority it became in other countries."
3684,Japan has conducted 2.2 tests per 1000 people.
3685,"For comparison, the rate in neighboring South Korea is 16; and in the United States, 43."
3686,"*

Nor has this [changed much](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-japan-testing-idUSKBN25R17D) over time:

*But a highly bureaucratic approval process means Japan has one of the lowest testing regimes among major economies, carrying out about 14 tests per 1,000 people, compared with 36 in South Korea and 246 in the United States."
3687,"*

*Patients wanting to be tested must go through telephone consultations, demonstrate they have symptoms or show they have been in touch with an infected person."
3688,Health ministry authorities must then approve the test and have in some cases refused to authorize them.
3689,"*

The government is keeping numbers artificially low by discouraging testing."
3690,"Given that hospitals were not overloaded even in most Western countries with rampant spread, the better overall health of Japanese people makes it even less likely."
3691,That's all that's going on here.
3692,Mate.
3693,"It was persistence, and not living in an island that got us through this."
3694,"We had started with masks and please-stay-home, and that was reducing the size of the increase, but soooo slowly."
3695,In the end the lockdown pain was worth it.
3696,"But you do have those unruly neighbours....Ours are the Kiwis, and they are a body of water away."

3701,Good post
3702,"Simple: I don't agree with mass protesting either, in the context of the pandemic."
3703,"However, some protests don't cause bad outbreaks because the participants wear masks and physically distance, unlike in other gatherings of a different political nature, where they don't practice prevention measures."
3704,Protesting people who wear masks and distance from each other have much lower risk than a smaller gathering without any measures at all.
3705,Homeless people are getting infected.
3706,"Depending where you are, there are differences in the handling of the homeless people and tracking them for infections."
3707,"For example, in Ecuador a few months ago, people were already dying in the streets when the virus was out of control."
3708,So it does happen.
3709,Agreed.

3745,You’re an idiot
3746,Can you actually do that to a patient without their or their family's consent?
3747,Because that's extremely scary if true.
3748,I'm talking about the patient that you signed a DNR order for.
3749,I've been exhibiting long-lasting symptoms that are potentially covid related for 3 months.
3750,I just got an antibody test and the provider suggested that it probably wouldn't show up if I had it because it's been so long since the initial symptoms.
3751,Is that true?
3752,"I read the Mayo Clinic and CDC's page on antibody test and they say it will take 1-3 weeks for antibodies to show in a test, but not really specifically how long until they *won't* show up on a test."
3753,"Well, Mayo does say ""Antibodies may be detected in your blood for several weeks after you recover from COVID-19.""."
3754,"But *several* is sort of vague, is that 3 weeks?"
3755,6 weeks?
3756,More?
3757,Is there some more precise information about this out there that I'm missing?
3758,*edit*: Just found this other input on this topic on my healthcare provider's network portal--**Can my results change over time?
3759,"**
Yes, if you tested your blood early, in the process of your body learning how to make this antibody, you could test negative."
3760,It takes up to 6 weeks for our bodies to learn how to make this antibody.
3761,We do not know how long the positive antibodies will stay but similar antibodies typically remain in the body for years.
3762,Except billionaires.
3763,So America is a diarrhea filled wave pool.
3764,This is becoming more obvious with every passing day.
3765,"At the rate the US is going, I'm not sure we will ever fully eradicate this."
3766,I'm not even sure if we will get things to manageable levels because today's resistance to the mask will be tomorrow's resistance to the vaccine.
3767,"I got told yesterday that handing out tickets for mask wearing was a better use of law enforcement than things like human trafficking, so I get it."
3768,"If 2020 has taught us anything, it’s that we will ignore the house burning down around us and mock those who run out and call the fire department."
3769,This is also false and overstating the truth about T-cells.
3770,The effectiveness of the immunological mechanisms you're referring to are dependent on your body's individual immune system.
3771,"Older individuals may be at greater risk as their immune responses are less adaptive, which fits with empirical evidence of severity."

3775,The guy is only trying to keep everyone healthy
3776,"Why do people who don't want to take the vaccine instantly get labeled and demonized as ""anti-vaxxers""?"
3777,Not necessarily.
3778,"Depending on the person's immune response and immune system, they can be challenged with an infection (and therefore test positive) but not spread via sterilizing immunity."
3779,"Nope, just thought a link may be relevant."

3793,Masks work.

3797,Well if you look at a chart you can clearly see three distinct waves.
3798,At least by the normal definition of what a wave looks like.
3799,It’s just that the waves are growing in magnitude.
3800,Furthermore I can separate them by distinct events: wave 1 comes with no measures in place.
3801,We lockdown and cases drop for two months.
3802,Wave 2 - we open up places that locked down and places with minimal lockdowns have outbreaks.
3803,"Then we have mask mandates basically everywhere and cases drop again for a month or two, and now it’s cold and people aren’t as compliant and we are seeing spikes for the third time...."
3804,Welcome to wave 3
3805,"So I said to my people, slow the waves down, please."
3806,That's funny.

3814,"Cases, positivity rate?"
3815,How do you measure worst?
3816,"I didn't want to get into that, and likely true."
3817,"But a proper shutdown with careful reopening would have mitigated most of the massive amount of cases we have rolling around now, with likely a low unemployment rate and strong economy with kids probably even in school for in-person learning with little concern for everyone's well being."

3856,"It should first go to those who need it most, though, such as front-line health workers, immunocompromised,  and the elderly."
3857,🤣🤣🤣who ever said its the third wave is so wrong.
3858,Like hello the first wave never came down so it’s more than obvious that we’re still in the first wave!!!!!

3868,"Your ability to excel in your individual talents should be valued, and so you can exchange your talents for other people's talents."

3872,"I have 0 years, 0 seconds for that matter, experience in anything medical lol"
3873,There are no winners here.
3874,I’m not really for the political blame game so I don’t see that as a pro aspect of your argument.
3875,Why can’t both groups work together to get children and teachers back to classrooms safely?
3876,Let’s stop the childish bickering about this side and that side.
3877,It’s ridiculous.
3878,"Both sides do it, and this is why people like me are independent."
3879,And what are the statistics for death of the age groups on school campuses?
3880,Why don’t states try to do a more specific strategy?
3881,"If a student or teacher is in this group or don’t want to come back, continue online."
3882,"If a student or teacher is more likely safe that not and want to go in person, go in person."
3883,We need a more sustainable plan because limiting everyone like we’ve been doing for the past seven months isn’t working.
3884,What are the statistics saying and for those more at risk what can we do to protect them?
3885,"Limiting everything, including the education of young people who need it in a world where education is very important to advance in society, is not the answer."
3886,"You’re saying that we need balance, but there’s no balance in your argument."
3887,We don’t know when a vaccine or treatments will be available.
3888,"Or if they’ll even come at all, though I believe they will."
3889,"Is that an excuse to let people fall behind, and I’m not talking just about education."
3890,"But economically, mentally, etc."
3891,You’re telling people to just wait until things get better (if they ever will) because you have the privilege to do that.

3920,Now can you imagine what would happen to society and the economy if we stopped all those social interactions?
3921,"It's medical training as in ""don't explode that lung"", not as in ""get that sheet of dead tree""."

3924,"We are talking about somewhat healthy but unconscious people, not corona cases."
3925,"How many 100's of people are saved each day, by treatment in hospitals."
3926,Those are the ones who will be dying soon as hospitals are overwhelmed.
3927,"COVID patients, car accident victims, complications during labour from government enforced births; if there is no capacity then all of these people will die, regardless of age."
3928,Lol
3929,Do you have any data to back up that claim or just fox news talking points?
3930,How about you actually read?
3931,You can’t get to a second wave if you never get off the first.

3939,Didn't want them getting into trouble.
3940,Had a lot of great times.
3941,There isn't necessarily a correlation between a state's response and that state's outcome (so far) because some states like New York and Connecticut have had great responses and also had high death rates and high rates of infection.
3942,I have no doubt that the change of events will be studied for decades.
3943,"Those numbers are an absolute joke and from your post, you are implying it as well."
3944,The Indian healthcare system is terrible to begin with and this has killed it.
3945,We have at least 10 people that have died from covid in India and many struggled to find a hospital to help.

3979,"Right now, a lot of countries have given up on proper isolation controls and just tell you to stay for 10-14 days at home without bothering much, that's because they are way too many positives to isolate."

4044,"Do you actually think I’ll go “Oh well he doesn’t think it’s valid, guess that argument isn’t true”?"

&gt;If you want to criticise Sweden use the actual figures, ~6000 deaths."
4049,The last months it has been around 2 a day on average.
4050,"Majority of deaths 80+, less than a thousand total under 70."
4051,No you dimwit.
4052,"When comparing countries, you use per capita rates."
4053,"Otherwise you would only ever look at China, Russia and the US."
4054,Sweden has the 12th worst outcome in the world.
4055,"In absolute terms, 5400 people have died needlessly."

&gt;He said, “We are extremely concerned that the Swedish model may be given some credence,” he said."
4057,“We believe it is ineffective.
4058,"Sweden has had an enormous amount of deaths per head of population, 5880 deaths representing 581 deaths per million population."
4059,"Compared with its neighbours it has been unsuccessful in preventing deaths—Finland, for example, has had 343 deaths, which equals 62 deaths per million population.”

Please explain to me why having a ten times higher per capita death rate than Norway and Finland is not a failure."
4060,"It also doesn't help that many of stories in the media of the people who died had pre existing conditions, were really old, and or were super morbidly obese."
4061,Healthy people read the articles and think that COVID isn't going to hurt them.
4062,The media hasn't sold the public on the idea that perfectly healthy people can lose the battle with COVID.
4063,Its also hard to keep up social distancing when many people don't give a fuck about their health.
4064,Its frustrating to go through all of this when millions of able bodied won't take care of their own health.
4065,"Don't forget that most surveys in the US have indicated that around 1/3 of the population will refuse to take the vaccine, no matter what."
4066,"Which in turn was named after Lord Melbourne, a British Prime Minister during the 1830s, who got his title from the town of Melbourne in Derby, whose name was originally ""Milleburn"" which was Anglo-Saxon for ""mill by the stream""."
4067,"They should get negative covid test before flying 72, hours prior to the flight."
4068,"&gt; But false-positive tests have costs, particularly if a vital employee (doctor, ambulance staff, air-traffic controller - whatever) ends up staying at home unnecessarily for two weeks."
4069,"It makes perfect sense to consider what is the appropriate balance between the risk of false positives and the risk of false negatives, and adjust it where appropriate."
4070,"This more critical than people realise, for example Belgium is now telling positive doctors to keep working because many of them are in isolation."
4071,"Imagine if instead of this, we concentrate on improving our sensitivity measures and only allow less afflicted doctors to work, we wouldn't have to risk having lower capacity and/or potentially infectious doctors working."
4072,"The problem is you might have been good or actually gotten vaccinated, but tons of douchebags will just not get vaccinated and won’t wear a mask and just say “I’m vaccinated”."
4073,"It will be much better overall for society if everyone just wears their damn masks until nobody needs to, which might be quite a while after you get your vaccines unfortunately."
4074,It would save many lives.
4075,r/coronavirus punching the air
4076,"Lol also no country has reached herd immunity yet, despite trying."
4077,It doesnt seem to work with covid
4078,Let's stop pretending that New York did anything but kill thousands of people for no reason.
4079,"Their death rate is still over double of Illinois, and there were plenty of incredibly stupid and obviously incredibly stupid policies happening at the time."
4080,The one that really stuck out was just putting covid patients back in nursing homes.
4081,This death rate is also  The fact that they haven't had another major wave doesn't mean much.
4082,Basically nowhere has had a true second wave.
4083,"There have been separate outbreaks in different parts of states/countries that may look like a second wave at a glance, but we have yet to see a city get whalloped and then get whalloped again in 4 months."
4084,"Countries that were hit earlier and similarly hard like Italy fared much, much better than New York did."
4085,"""It was early"" isn't a real excuse."
4086,There is more to pandemic response than getting on TV and pretending to be really mad about everything so people ignore that your election platform was reducing healthcare spending that you made good on in the middle of a pandemic.
4087,Should add all the suicides to the count.
4088,Coronavirus isn’t the only way to die.
4089,"Yes, NY/NJ had their first wave, NJ looks like it may be just starting a second wave, NY less so, still pretty flat."
4090,Not even eating or drinking.
4091,"That's hardcore, kudos to you"
4092,I used to shop at night when the store was almost empty but they reduced their hours so now it's always packed when I have to go.
4093,No choice but for everyone to flood when places reduce their hours.
4094,"There’s the thing, people tend to confuse moderation with reasonableness, which are absolutely not the same thing."
4095,"The message being sent out is way off the mark and being “somewhere in the middle” of two perceived extremes doesn’t always mean being sensible, it can just mean people are afraid of being seen as “extremist” (by what and whose standards?)"
4096,- and that’s what polarization does to many.
4097,"It’s not exactly reasonable to meet for social purposes or to share a meal with other people in the middle of a pandemic that’s devastating the world, and yet not doing so is considered extreme (in part because there’s so many people fervently preaching the exact opposite)."
4098,"Granted, locking yourself up in the basement and not going outside even for a walk by yourself is way over the top, but then I really never heard of anyone doing that (though I definitely don’t doubt the existence of such people)."
4099,"But when a single infected person can set a chain of transmission that causes dozens, hundreds, thousands of secondary cases and ultimately a big outbreak, keeping your distance from other people instead of giving in frivolous wants/needs is actually the sensible thing to do."
4100,"With nearly 8 billion people on the planet and a transmissible potentially deadly virus, if everyone takes precautions in moderation there will be still a lot of infections and deaths going on."
4101,See [this model] (https://statnet.org/COVID-JustOneFriend/) showing how meeting with just one friend maintains a level of connectivity a lot higher than a network with just essential worker ties.
4102,&gt;This network is a lot more connected than the one with just essential workers.
4103,"Visiting your friend means that you can reach almost all the other households in your community, and they can reach you!"
4104,That includes lots of people you don’t even know.
4105,The virus can easily travel from them to you and then far beyond to many others.
4106,All before you even know you’re infected.
4107,"It’s a very connected, and effective, network of transmission."
4108,"One should consider that there are a lot of essential workers, so no perfect isolation there and more importantly that loads of people are meeting way more than one contact, so it’s not at all extreme to say that everyone who can isolate should definitely strive for that rather than staying somewhere in the middle."
4109,"Trouble is, there was never a solid unified message on how serious the pandemic situation is and about the importance of really following the preventive measures."
4110,"Lots of contradicting messages from the government, experts and also groups and individuals who were dedicated to downplaying the pandemic."
4111,"So now people are lost, fatigued and many have settled on choosing an easier path than actually adhering to the infection control guidelines."
4112,And yet they are rebelling not against the rich but against public health attempts to stop the virus...
4113,You are missing the basics of airborne transmission if it isn’t obvious why airplanes aren’t much worse than grocery stores.
4114,Traveling is frowned upon because that’s how the disease moves to new areas.
4115,Some people will travel while sick or asymptomatic and cause a big outbreak in a region which didn’t have a big outbreak.
4116,"&gt;I don't know if you've actually spoken to any Swedes, but they're back to living their normal lives, not that they ever really stopped

As a Norwegian living close to the border of Sweden, you are straight up lying"
4117,B-cells seems to forget coronaviruses which is why neutralizing antibodies disappear and sterilizing immunity is lost over time.
4118,"CD4+ and CD8+ T-cells have better memory and those will become activated on reinfection, which will reduce the severity of disease."
4119,"Vaccines may predominantly create B-cells responses which is why yearly booster shots may be very necessary, and certainly necessary to prevent infection and transmission (some vaccines may produce better CD4+/CD8+ responses from others, but nobody knows which approaches will be the winners there)."
4120,Which is really more or less what has been said from day #1.
4121,"Vaccines possible, will need boosters, immunity from reinfection will be 12-24 months like other coronaviruses."
4122,Not very alarmist.
4123,"While waiting outside for take out today, a fellow customer started telling me a theory I've never heard."
4124,I was waiting for my credit card to be returned so was stuck listening to him.
4125,It was kinda funny so I started asking him how it all worked.
4126,His theory is Iran is spraying a chemical from the roof tops as pay back for the US assassination of Irani general.
4127,Trump was never infected and it was all staged.
4128,"The virus is even deadlier than said, and Trump is doing nothing to stop it."
4129,I was surprised it was an anti-trump conspiracy.
4130,I didn't know those were floating around out there.
4131,It made me think someone should write a coffee table book with all these conspiracies and their origin.
4132,"We are not ""months away from a vaccine"", that's wishful thinking"
4133,Imagine if millions of people in the US were furloughed.
4134,AGAIN.
4135,Without a stimulus.
4136,The bad news is the antibodies don't seem to stick around long - so the vaccine might well be as much use as a fart in a thunderstorm.
4137,[removed]
4138,And that's the biggest tragedy here -- the propaganda campaign has been so successful that people will rebel against trying to stop the virus.
4139,Not against the rich who will literally murder millions so that there is no wealth redistribution (which is what taking care of those unemployed during a prolonged lockdown and mobilizing society to deal with the virus would have required) and who organized that propaganda campaign.
4140,"And now we have normalized mass death and when the next virus shows up and it kills 5% of people, not 1-1.5%, it will be all that much easier to say ""too expensive to do anything, some of you will have to die"""
4141,What an idiot.

4322,The US isn't unique in it's failure to control the virus.
4323,"It's slightly more out of hand than in most western countries, but many European countries are just as bad as the US and always have been."
4324,They just didn't get testing online as quickly.
4325,"Hypoglycemia, pregnancy, weight loss diets, overactive thyroid, those who don’t have/ don’t have access to a balanced diet are all valid reasons why someone would need to eat or drink something frequently."
4326,"You can’t tell people they can’t eat, it’s immoral."
4327,"There are many people that this isn’t the case for, like those that you treat in the hospital."
4328,It doesn’t mean it’s applicable to everyone though.
4329,I had a doctors visit today.
4330,My doctor told me that if you compare death from past years covid hasn’t contributed any excess death.
4331,"I live in NYC, one of the hardest hit locations in the world and this motherfker said what, and is a doctor????"
4332,?
4333,Hold my beer.
4334,Florida
4335,My guess is based on observation of current realities.
4336,"The public health officials (experts) tend to focus recommendations on what the science suggests, minimizing the political and economic areas as areas of focus as they are outside their expertise."
4337,The political and economic infrastructure required to effectively implement strict lockdowns is not in place.
4338,It’s the same irony reflected that people in the ‘Red States’ tend to not realize how much transfer of funds goes from Blue to Red.
4339,"So the social ‘safety net’ is, as it stands, under attack by the very people who benefit the most."
4340,To implement the kind of targeted financial and other support requires a bare minimum of infrastructure.
4341,It can be built but it takes time we don’t have.
4342,An example of this was Florida where the Republicans had deliberately crippled the unemployment system.
4343,When it became needed as a conduit for aid from the Feds it broke down.
4344,Another example was the direct financial support the Feds provided to citizens.
4345,To people who have lost their income the payments were a pittance.
4346,But the political reality required that funds be sent to huge numbers of people that don’t need it and provided the usual interface for well resourced corporate grifters to manipulation to their own advantage.
4347,And in absolute terms it was a massive federal expenditure.
4348,I have yet to hear a single person give concrete proposals about how to protect the people will join the ranks of the already destitute if a hard shutdown is broadly mandated.
4349,Good to know about the possible month-to-month variance.
4350,I didn't really see the point of testing earlier because I was staying inside since I felt too sick to do anything anyway.
4351,"Now, I'm having lasting problems with constant fatigue and getting winded easy like I've never experienced, so it'd just be nice to have confirmation in case I need further treatment."
4352,Same with Madrid.
4353,Only 3?

4379,Shocker.
4380,I work in a PCP.
4381,I’d say it’s medium risk because we don’t do any invasive procedures (unless it’s an absolute emergency) and don’t have patients on CPAPs and ventilators.
4382,"All of our patients wear masks (regular ones, nothing fancy)."
4383,I personally use a faceshield with masks (questionable quality FFP2s and KN95s with earloops instead of headbands).
4384,I’ve tested 3 times and all of them turned out negative.
4385,I think it comes to a combination of me and the patients wearing masks because I remember reading CDC guidelines for HCWs back March they mentioned if two are wearing surgical masks only it’s equivalent to the worker wearing a properly sealed N95s.
4386,But if it comes to intubating or dealing with ventilated patients?
4387,i wouldn’t trust anybuthing but genuine 3M or Dragër FFP2/FFP3s.
4388,If you can get your hands on one and the mask is properly sealed on your face (i.e.
4389,"no facial hair or regular masks underneath) with a goggle/faceshield, I’d say chances of catching Covid anywhere is low."

4400,Unless this information can be provided we can't really come to any conclusions.
4401,If all people on the plane have the same strain it makes it more likely but not a guarantee.
4402,If it's a mixture of strains then we know it's bullshit that they all got it from the one flight.

4591,Perhaps COVID 19 will be similar to SARS where there was found to be an immune response decades later (an immune response doesn't necessarily mean protective/sterilising immunity though) although due to the small number of people who actually got infected we don't know too much.
4592,Or perhaps it will behave more like other Coronavirus's that have circulated in human populations for much longer.

4596,"All righty, I was misled by the unsustainable thrust of this article."
4597,"Here's what you need to know:
""""Exposure possibilities for flight cases include in-flight, during overnight transfer/pre-flight or unknown acquisition before the flight."
4598,"The incubation period for COVID-19 may be as short as 2 days, so the potential for in-flight/airport transmission exists in this outbreak [4,5]."
4599,In-flight transmission is a plausible exposure for cases in Group 1 and Group 2 given seating arrangements and onset dates.
4600,"One case could hypothetically have acquired the virus as a close household contact of a previous positive case, with confirmed case onset date less than two incubation periods before the flight, and symptom onset in the flight case was 48 h after the flight."
4601,In-flight transmission was the only common exposure for four other cases (Flight Groups 3 and 4) with date of onset within four days of the flight in all but the possible tertiary case.
4602,"This case from Group 3 developed symptoms nine days after the flight and so may have acquired the infection in-flight or possibly after the flight through transmission within the household. """
4603,"So, actually the duration of the flight and the 17% occupancy might or might not have anything at all to do with 13 people infected."
4604,Some or all of them may have been infected before boarding.
4605,Be careful with the conclusions you draw from this article.
4606,But still be very careful on an plane and wear N95 and do what Studentdoctor563 does.
4607,I don't think we're dealing with any will-definitely-kill-me virus though.
4608,"&gt; The difference happened when supply became available, other governments quickly changed their tune and said now masks were required and important."
4609,I think that ploy was wrong from the start.
4610,"On the contrary , China since day 1(the day Wuhan was locked-down) had been telling the truth about masks --- that it is important and everyone must wear one."
4611,"Yes , there had been shortages for about 2-3 weeks, but since the price went up fast, production picked up really fast because thousands of factories switched to making masks overnight."
4612,"And that, my friend,  is called the force of free market at work."
4613,"If American CDC had done the same thing and been truthful about mask from the beginning,  I am pretty sure that same thing would have happened here."
4614,"Instead, they did not trust the power of free market, and ruined people's trust for them."
4615,and they were killed for that to happen and probably raised to be murdered.
4616,If the people can't think rationally it is the government's responsibility to think for them and make them follow the restrictions.

4625,No it doesnt.
4626,There are numerous anecdotal reports of reinfection from clinicians.
4627,Problem is media and scientific lit.
4628,discount it til you have genomic evidence.
4629,Gene sequencing is very limited in Western countries.
4630,Our public is in for a nasty surprise.
4631,It's still pretty bad.
4632,We will be back to March rates in no time.
4633,Portland area is already seeing record high cases and deaths.
4634,I've never been happier to live in the most isolated capital city in the world this year.
4635,It played a large part on keeping infections here in the west so low.
4636,Well done Victoria!
4637,Nah man the meme's Good Guy Greg for a reason.
4638,"Even if everyone is susceptible again immediately, reinfections will be rare in many countries."
4639,"It all depends on two thing: 

1."
4640,Is reinfection info even collected?
4641,"Germany admitted not doing that, for example."
4642,"I saw hundreds of people claiming reinfection on social media, but no one listens to them officially."
4643,"Also, just collecting sequencing-confirmed cases will miss almost every case."
4644,2.
4645,Are infections and testing random or heavily depending on individual character?
4646,"If it is fully random, Israel data, for example, would suggest that everyone is susceptible again after recovering."
4647,"in fact, I assume that's an improper usage of the word ""asymptomatic"" (for Chinese gov.)"
4648,"they are more like ""people who are truly asymptomatic &amp; people who are still in incubation period therefore haven't show any symptoms yet""."
4649,"so it should be a good sign, they caught the outbreak in an early stage."
4650,We had a fair share though.
4651,[Bunnings Karen](https://youtu.be/heY0lvOM0Sw) is a particularly juicy morsel
4652,"Compare covid to its twin brother SARS with had an immune response 17 years later, not the common cold."
4653,"Also, we would still be seeing hundreds or even thousands of reinfections even if they are hard to test for."
4654,How reliable are the tests?
4655,I think that is the key to reducing the risk of travel.
4656,Doesn't mean that it's a main driver for the pandemic.
4657,You're conflating things.
4658,Look at the bigger picture and listen to the science instead of your gut feeling.
4659,It's very hard to track and verify reinfection so it's not as clear cut as you claim.
4660,Particularly with the lack of testing in the first wave.
4661,'we're not seeing a ton of reinfections seven months later I think we are kind of good.'
4662,"Not really 7 months isn't that long, as the article says most coronavirus's only give 6 to 12 months of immunity, it's entirely possible that COVID 19 is towards the latter half of that scale and come winter a proportion of those who got exposed in the initial March wave end up being susceptible again."

4668,I'd pick SxSW over Coachella.
4669,Austin is an amazing city.
4670,Coachella has really stopped being about the music and more about saying you were there.
4671,The line up quality has really gone down.
4672,"First wave, third wave?"
4673,Can we stop getting conflicting reports?
4674,"Your body doesn't continuously produce antibodies for every pathogen you've ever come into contact with, that'd be ridiculously inefficient."
4675,"The real indicator of long term immunity would be T and B cells, tests for those are more expensive and difficult to scale up so we're not going to see as many reports about them."
4676,"It's actually quite hard to track and verify reinfections, many people didn't get tested in wave 1 and you usually need a negative test or 2 to prove you no longer have it (which again few countries did in wave 1) before getting a positive test again."
4677,It's quite likely that the true number of reinfections is higher and that immunity will wane over time (we don't know the timescale).
4678,"Yes it's correct that reinfection so far appears rare, but to say there's 30 odd in millions of cases is likely overstating it."
4679,"As time goes on, immunity from the initial March wave may start waning and reinfections become more common."
4680,"Poland just banned abortion recently, and is no longer a democracy."
4681,"Because of veto and the Poland-Hungary anti-democratic friendship, Europe can't take any action."
4682,I don't think Germany would be happy to help in this political context.
4683,I remember.
4684,"I wrote ""seems"" and ""?"""
4685,because im not claiming immunity definately lasts.
4686,It looks like it though
4687,You forgot about Hitler
4688,The Healthcare professionals are thinking maybe they have enough money to say f it and walk away...for good.
4689,"Lol or maybe because they're sick of being told to ""stay inside for a few weeks and wear masks"" for &gt;7 months"
4690,"Deaths, as OP stated."

4694,he wants to leave ad much destruction as possible
4695,I love it.
4696,Smfh dude fauci needs to stop doing this man I love him but his estimates have gotten a bit ridiculous at times
4697,Multiple studies have been carried out for this and if we're not seeing a ton of reinfections seven months later I think we are kind of good.
4698,Exactly.
4699,DNA sequencing should have been used to figure this out.
4700,I wrote a lengthy email to the journalist and the health and science editor above the journalist.
4701,This is really a story about how international travel can import spread.
4702,That is all that can really be concluded.
4703,The duration of the flight and the fact that it was only 17% full have not been shown to have any bearing.
4704,But also neither factor has been ruled out.
4705,It is ambiguous and no conclusions can be made.
4706,"That doesn't fit the situation in Sweden at all where most people are antimaskers but hate everything you describe, and our government took an antimask stance on day 1."
4707,Definitely not majority of people are superstitious.
4708,"Fengshui is more popular in Hong Kong, Macau, Taiwan."
4709,"""Afterlife cash burning ceremony"" to top up wallet of ancesters underground is purely a cultural convention."
4710,"Although nowadays Chinese do talk about reunion with loved ones again after reincarnation to express strong bonds with each other, still,  death is death, life is only a one time experience."
4711,Other comments are pretty accurate.
4712,I almost forgot about that unique period around Feb-March
4713,"Just a heads up, I have no idea how economist got those excess deaths for Sweden."
4714,"[official data is here and (updated every monday)](https://www.scb.se/hitta-statistik/statistik-efter-amne/befolkning/befolkningens-sammansattning/befolkningsstatistik/pong/tabell-och-diagram/preliminar-statistik-over-doda/) (Table 6, ""Överdödlighet"" to the rightmost of the table)."

4717,3% of 330 million is still 10 million deaths
4718,some chose to do worse than nothing.
4719,"they published articles laughing at China instead of learning even as Chinese doctors and scientists published genomic data, diagnostic data and clinical guidebooks."
4720,then they were surprised when publishing snarky articles doesn't stop the virus and blame is thrown all around.
4721,"I'm sorry, I chuckled at covid time."
4722,Interesting times we live in.
4723,And liberals praise everything he does.
4724,How it goes.
4725,"If this happened the USD which is currently worth 92 cents (worth 100 cents in February) would be soon worth 50 cents, then 30 cents and so on."
4726,Hyperinflation.

4739,"Problem with ""I worn a mask and I still got it"", is how pathetic many are ""wearing"" their ""masks""."

4742,$100 says if Trump wins re-election Fauci gets fired

4745,"You say it's rubbish but the researchers behind the study say this:

' However, the researchers warn antibodies tend to be highly predictive of who is protected."
4746,"Prof Wendy Barclay said: ""We can see the antibodies and we can see them declining and we know antibodies on their own are quite protective."
4747,"""On the balance of evidence, I would say it would look as if immunity declines away at the same rate as antibodies decline away, and that this is an indication of waning immunity."""

T-Cells and the like may play a role but we do not know for sure that everyone will have protective immunity months and years after an initial infection."
4751,I have three P100 half-face respirators and extra filters.
4752,I had two from an ancient project.
4753,"Lucky for me, the manufacturer of the HEPA filters says the filters do not expire!"
4754,"They clog in high dust environments, but that is not the situation here."
4755,I bought a 3rd when people started thinking this was done with and supplies were briefly replenished.
4756,I have it in case those close to me decide they want to get serious and step up from N95.
4757,I also have an Airinum mask which is an over-priced but more stylish N95.
4758,"I cannot find however, any testing of the Airinum and that makes me nervous."
4759,"The fact that they have been around since 2016 gives some comfort that the company is making a legit product, but I would still love to see a test result."

4763,Oh boy.
4764,Remember when they told us pre-symptomatic spread was an anomaly?
4765,Or there was no aerosol transmission?
4766,You can't save everybody.
4767,Get yourself the vaccine.
4768,"You will be safe, and you won't be spreading the virus."
4769,"It will not be your fault anymore, whatever happens."
4770,"It is sad, but even in Europe there will be those who refuse the vaccine."
4771,"I'm Italian, and recently there has been stories of storeowners who ask their clients to wear a mask, and the clients strike them."
4772,You are utterly incorrect.
4773,You are comparing apples to oranges.
4774,"If you get chickenpox once, you cannot get it again."
4775,"If you get Covid-19 once and recover, you can get it again 2-4 months later, than again 2-4 months after that."
4776,It is a coronavirus.
4777,Think of it as a common cold virus on steroids.
4778,At least in my state this is our second wave.

4781,"I used to work in childcare on and off for years, and I was sick all the time."

4786,To sum things up: Kids are gross.

4792,One of the top hotspots in Europe at the moment
4793,Yes and sewage testing
4794,"Only in this case, you are blaming the one who \*saw\* the fire first."
4795,"As is the nature of this virus, it can go around for some time undetected, as it is in most cases very close to a common cold."
4796,"And since it was detected in sewage in Italy and Spain in 2019, perhaps it needed to be brought somewhere where people would actually care and recognize it as a novel virus, perhaps in a country which is the most fcking technologically advanced country in the world."
4797,Probably company policy rather than personal preference.
4798,After all the pub owners' motto for servers is 'tits and teeth' and masks mess with that winning recipe.
4799,My real 30th birthday will be celebrated whenever COVID ends no matter how far into the future that is
4800,Why are they still testing for conventional antibodies (IgG?)
4801,and not B or T cells?
4802,We have known now for many months that conventional antibodies fade.
4803,We need to figure out what kind of protection the memory immunity of B or T cells gives (if any).
4804,I imagine you have a window seat and adjust the overhead air flow directed away from you toward the aisle.
4805,Unless they're talking about covering up the goggle vents.
4806,/r/blursed
4807,"In normal conditions, I agree."
4808,"But in actual high viral conditions, I don't think that is good enough and I would want the full protection from P100."
4809,"&gt; And arguably, such a spontaneous lockdown scenario could be even more economically devastating than a planned lockdown."
4810,"Yeah, well that's sort of exactly what I meant with the previous comment."
4811,"Shame they don't see it, or worse they know but deliberately ignore it."
4812,"It honestly seems like we are approaching such a dead-end slowly but surely, instead of slamming on brakes when there is still some time left before it will hurt much more."
4813,"In either case, it all depends more on the people anyway."
4814,"If in November we still have people denying, bypassing restrictions, and ignoring anything that epidemiologists say, we might as well just let it roll and see where that takes us."
4815,And I think the same rules apply to self-serve checkouts.
4816,"They are awesome if disinfected regularly, if people using them are responsible and if there are some limits in place."
4817,If not it's just a prolonged stay in an arguably even more dangerous environment.

4821,how do you defeat something if you can't control it?
4822,that is literally impossible.
4823,containing is the very definition of not defeating.
4824,The CDC under unprecedented political pressure has been an absolute joke.
4825,Many within its top ranks talk of leaving if Trump is re elected.
4826,I sincerely hope the damage done to their credibility is repairable with a Biden win.
4827,Excellent!
4828,Many of the vaccines in testing require special refrigeration which could be very costly.
4829,The only one that I know of that doesnt is inovio's vaccine
4830,But the immunity seems to last for atleast 8 months?
4831,After all there has been very few reinfections and millions of cases.
4832,The reinfections are anomalies.
4833,Could not agree more.
4834,They have sucked the empathy pool bone dry.
4835,wait so all my colleges at work have a personality disorder and i don't?
4836,i find this hard to believe

4841,*respiratory disorder.
4842,Narcissistic traits were normalized after the arrival of DT.
4843,Hopefully they will return to the closet after he goes by-by.
4844,That's probably the only reason they're reporting the cases.
4845,Their standard practice is to pretend that outbreaks don't exist while locking people in their houses.
4846,Yep.
4847,We are almost as bad as the US.

4850,"No, we don't get PPE."
4851,They gave us bullshit cloth masks full well knowing the science was favoring an airborne version of the virus when in an indoor setting with poor ventilation.
4852,The kids of more affluent families are in class every day in private school or they're in a pandemic pod or have a private tutor - and they're learning algebra on time.
4853,"Anyone who believes it's OK to close schools for a year or two because all the kids will be equally affected is ignorant of existing educational inequalities, which the pandemic response has made far worse."
4854,Zero cases is an unrealistic goal.
4855,I think it might be literally impossible.
4856,I dont really have any answers or ideas but I think you'd have riots on your hands if you even tried it
4857,"You'd hope that logic changes post-election, since nothing is getting approved before Nov 3rd."
4858,At least the us can say they did it in the fitst wave.
4859,We in europe where to complacent to ward of the second wave...
4860,Would it be independent from the rise in Europe?
4861,True.
4862,"And you need to have several symptoms to be tested :/  
And the worst thing is, all the rises in infection rates will be blamed on the protesters... :/"

4879,Before every landing?
4880,Impressive.
4881,Maybe not if we could all wear masks!
4882,I'll just show myself out.
4883,WHO also expects that social distancing and masks will be needed until 2022.

4885,Thanks
4886,but BUT but BUT but BUT but BUT but BUT but BUT but BUT but BUT COVID IS A HOAX DOU :((((
4887,"I mean not really if they want to actually adopt a proper strategy of zero cases like New Zealand or Australia, mainly because lots of people won’t follow any rules in a second full lockdown and I can’t see how you can feasibly police a whole country 🤷‍♂️"
4888,"Well, you would never actually fully suppress the virus during the low point of the wave."
4889,All viral wave means is a rise and fall in infection.
4890,There is no real scientific definition.
4891,It's just something people use casually to refer to basic large-scale trends.
4892,https://www.bbc.com/news/health-53113785
4893,&gt;Now the path is reversed.
4894,"First it hits the younger (schools, bars, etc) then it spreads to older family members."
4895,That means once you have an increase in cases like we see it is extremely likely the younger population might be the primary vehicle of infection.
4896,And when numbers increase it might be too late.
4897,"Yes, but this is the data we have now, that's why they are taking measures now, my question is if the reason the government didn't took preemptive measure was because they didn't know enough in July/August."
4898,"&amp;#x200B;

&gt; One thing that must be said is right now there are many classes that have been forced to do online lessons because of outbreaks."
4899,And by law everyone having a quarantined kid under 14 must work from home or if not possible stay home and get state relief.

4922,"Considering we’ve not even come close to having a period where there isn’t any new cases in a day, I think we can count this year as the first wave and next year the second wave."
4923,"LOL, you're defined by your stupidity."
4924,"This is not about culture, this is about not being able to understand what doctors and scientists say, and not being able to understand that what has been happening in France, England and Spain, will happen in your country too."

4926,And with you being a pompous moron.
4927,No this doesn't mean immunity is suddenly short now

4929,Slight hyperbole.

4932,"If we average Monday and Tuesday, we take monday and Tuesday and divide each by the number of hours, then it should be more comparable."
4933,Well duh
4934,That is still compatible with what happened here if you read the article.
4935,Also expect an extreme rise in cases as soon as the vaccine is approved as people let their desire to socialize get the better of them and use the vaccine as an excuse to not follow social distancing guidelines and wear masks.
4936,There's no real definition of viral waves in this context.
4937,So it's kind of just an opinion and there is no right answer.
4938,Good luck man but odds are you are actually fine!

Supposedly China and Russia has a working vaccine, yet more people in russia getting infected and media blackouts in China keeping it's count at neg 1,000,000,000
To top it all off, even with climbing numbers, leaders think it's time to reopen restaurants, bard and gyms."

4965,Worst case US will get herd immunity next year.
4966,There are only so many people the virus can infect.
4967,Let's consider the 0.1% number for a second: 328 million people in the US.
4968,"If 0.1% die from the flu that would be 328,000 deaths."
4969,"The reality: 12,000 to 60,000 deaths annually since 2010."
4970,"By the way, the pandemic has already resulted in 300,000 (excess) deaths in the US."
4971,Covid is FAR worse than the flu.
4972,"&gt;I assume lots of people already wrote them, including media."
4973,So i dont think its nice of me to write them aswell.
4974,"Ah, don't worry about it it is their job after all, the worst thing that could happen is that they don't reply."
4975,&gt;I mean if the numbers ad up should it be world news?
4976,"Yes, I believe it should be world news."
4977,This would help create a more nuanced approach to how to deal with the Coronavirus.
4978,"Making sure that we always have extra capacity at the ICU's, so that people with other conditions can the medical attention they need."
4979,So waning immunity confirmed.
4980,"😧 

&gt;The hope is the second infection will be milder than the first, even if  immunity does decline, as the body should have an ""immune memory"" of the first encounter and know how to fight back."
4981,"Well, they get to continue celebrating wearing flip-flops in November and having no heart, no soul, and no character"
4982,"I guess that's a good point, but there's still too many people that think corona is a hoax."
4983,There will be more cases.
4984,Alpine horn blow from Switzerland.
4985,"I found  ""Usually, opioids are the leading cause of death in these demographics all over the country."""

4990,&gt;The Chinese laboratory Sinopharma should deliver to Morocco 10 million doses of vaccine against Covid-19 during the month of December.
4991,"&gt;  
&gt;*Al Ahdath Al Maghribia* reports, in its edition of Tuesday, October 27, that only 5 million Moroccans will be vaccinated, knowing that two doses of this vaccine must be injected in the interval of 21 days."
4992,"&gt;  
&gt;Previously, the Ministry of Health had entered into an agreement with the AstraZeneca laboratory for the acquisition of 17 million doses, with an optional purchase option of 3 million doses when needed."
4993,"In order to be able to vaccinate all Moroccans, the government is currently negotiating with the Pfizer, Johnson Johnson and Casina Pio laboratories to acquire the sufficient quantity."
4994,"&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;The goal is to vaccinate 80% of citizens over 18, while not excluding extending this campaign to the youngest."
4995,The vaccination operation will first concern staff in the health and national security sectors.
4996,"Vulnerable categories such as people over 65, patients with chronic diseases and pregnant women, as well as civil servants and public transport staff will follow."
4997,"&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;*Al Ahdath Al Maghribia* reports that vaccination against Covid-19 is not compulsory."
4998,"The Ministry of Health will, however, launch massive campaigns to sensitize the population on the need to be vaccinated and the importance of guarding against the pandemic."
4999,"According to the specifications signed between the Kingdom and China, the Moroccan authorities should receive, on November 15, the conclusions of clinical trials carried out on 600 Moroccan volunteers."
5000,"&gt;  
&gt;It should be noted that the tests carried out in countries such as the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain and Argentina have demonstrated the effectiveness of the vaccine from the Sinopharma laboratory, as well as the absence of any harmful effect on the health of citizens."
5001,"Morocco should, thereafter, start manufacturing this vaccine after obtaining the necessary authorizations and technologies from Chinese scientists and before it is exported to Africa from the ""Cité Mohammed VI Tanger Tech""."
5002,"""."
5003,And I found it to be asinine so did all my coworkers.
5004,They can only provide take out.
5005,I didn't find any statement here that masks were the only difference between the counties.
5006,Did I overlook it?
5007,Or is it possible that the 'mask' counties were also enforcing distancing measures that the other counties were not enforcing?
5008,&gt; although it doesn't mean we should be ignoring what caused this terrible second wave to begin with.
5009,I'm assuming you mean that the second wave was caused by the Andrews government incompetence in the first place?
5010,That's the unmentioned elephant in the room in this whole thread of rainbows and sunshine.
5011,First one and then the other
5012,"I have to add something that really has not been highlighted ... the reason that the populace of Melbourne and Victoria have been (largely) adherent with these measures, was in no small part, due to the massive amount of financial support that has been provided to those who are infected, isolated or in quarantine, to keep them home."
5013,"Businesses have been supported in a smaller way with grants and emergency funds .. and of course, we have universal health care."
5014,"Tests are free, readily available from drive-through sites and you now thankfully, get a result back in 24 hours (so you don't have to quarantine longer if you waiting for a negative result)."
5015,"Without the not insubstantial amount of ""socialist medicine"" support .. oh and fund and a small matter of being able to stop people from arriving in the state, we would have been fucked."
5016,Kudos from China!
5017,Couldn’t be more proud as a PR currently hiding the virus in China.
5018,"It truly proves that less-draconian, more-humanitarian measures also work to contain it."
5019,(In comparison to what I have been through in China.)
5020,Looking forward to returning to good ol’ Oz!
5021,"Of course after a 14-day quarantine, that is!"
5022,Thank you for this reminder.
5023,We have history to reflect upon and that in and of itself is powerful.
5024,Their looking at more a 4 month immunity if you've actually had covid a mew study from the UK came out.
5025,They welded people inside their homes in Wuhan during the first outbreak.
5026,"So yes, the people just did not go out."
5027,"&gt; it looks like they were super cautious, 

Somewhat ok measures + absolutely minimal tasting with huge positive turnout = low number of official infections."
5028,"The real numbers now are probably the same as in France, meaning worse than in France, since its population is 50% larger."
5029,The reason for that is the huge 20~25% rate of positive tests.
5030,It's almost 100% in one region.
5031,"If you’re college age and not dealing with some underlying health condition then you’ll probably be one of the very last people to get a vaccine, if you get one at all that is !"
5032,Well the outbreak in march/april was extrenely limited from a geographical point of view.
5033,And once the hospitals became the main source of infections then the virus was following the opposite path compared to today.
5034,Let me explain.
5035,You had an overlap between flu season and covid.
5036,Limited testing.
5037,So it entered the hospitals.
5038,The first to be infected were those that belong to an elderly age group.
5039,Once you lockdown the spread will also continue at home but it will move to younger age groups that have less symptoms.
5040,So it became quite hard to understand how kids would be affected if they were in lockdown and had no symptoms.
5041,Now the path is reversed.
5042,"First it hits the younger (schools, bars, etc) then it spreads to older family members."
5043,That means once you have an increase in cases like we see it is extremely likely the younger population might be the primary vehicle of infection.
5044,And when numbers increase it might be too late.
5045,I agree with what you say.
5046,They should have allowed only primary and kindergarten at first and monitor the situation.
5047,One thing that must be said is right now there are many classes that have been forced to do online lessons because of outbreaks.
5048,And by law everyone having a quarantined kid under 14 must work from home or if not possible stay home and get state relief.
5049,This reality is already here.
5050,Not really.
5051,"I think best numbers I've seen suggest that well over half of the population must be immune to the disease, quite possibly even up to around three quarters of the population."
5052,"This is based on the estimated infectiousness of the disease, where it is thought that under normal conditions one person maybe passes it on to 2-3 other people."
5053,"If that is the case, then well over majority must be immune so that the disease starves out and doesn't get passed on to more than 1 people by each sick person."
5054,The answer is further complicated by questions of the length of the immunity granted by vaccination or by recovering from the disease.
5055,"If the immunity from vaccination will be short-lived, say around 1 year only, then vaccinations must be periodically refreshed in perpetuity to keep the disease in check."
5056,[removed]
5057,I agree- he’s so gentle and understated!
5058,That makes sense.
5059,"Just to be clear, I think that the signs of immunity lastning atleast 8 months strongly outweigh the signs of immunity not lasting."
5060,"It sucks youre getting down voted cause youre right...masks are more effective then the vaccines theyre making for covid19, ive read their effectivity rate is like 25-50% max vs masks where if two ppl are wearing them its 75% effectivity up to 90 if social distancing and theyre the right kinda masks."
5061,Everyone here and a lot other places are actijg like a vaccine will just magically make everything go back to normal and now i see theyre burying their head in the sand to avoid the reality.
5062,This isnt polio or chickenpox.
5063,You cant just get a vaccine and then you can do whatever.
5064,I sucls but we cant just start acting like the anti-maskers and covid denyers and the ppl who are fed up and started going out.
5065,It sucks but we still have to do our part in saving fucking lives.
5066,Are bars and restaurants still open?
5067,S.Korea actually did a very quick reaction: Instant lockdown major cities + massive test + population detain.
5068,"They made it successful because the scale of the country &amp; population, along with the pandemic(was at Feb.) is comparatively controllable."
5069,"The ""Shinchoji Church of Jesus"" organization was acclaimed &amp; instigate people not to wearing masks &amp; ignorant the social distance publically."
5070,This Church was instantly suppressed.
5071,"Japan, somehow taking a way milder action to the Covid, but it suffers longer than Korea"
5072,I'm sorry this happened to you and you lost your cafe.
5073,I commented elsewhere that it's been tough.
5074,Personally I've kept my job and home.
5075,Mental health is so-so but getting there.
5076,"But really, I felt for all the small business owners like yourself, those who were jobless or had mortgage stress."
5077,It would have been day to day stress over such a long period of time.
5078,I can't imagine.
5079,Hopefully recovery comes quickly!
5080,All the best with your business.
5081,Which suburb are you thinking for your restaurant?

5085,Throw them away when they are nasty or falling apart.
5086,Leave them in a paper bag for a week if you want to kill everything on them and have a few in rotation.
5087,"Masks only improve their filtration as they get clogged, so you can use them until it becomes harder to breathe through."
5088,"This could be daily if working in extremely dusty environments, but basically never for pandemic use."
5089,Sounds like steak can disinfect and clean n95 without damaging them like washing them other ways easily can.
5090,Steam not steak.
5091,Lol autocorrect.
5092,It sounds like the variance is based on having it “under control” (very few to no deaths and a very low positivity rate far below 1%) being the end of a wave vs. the end of a spike.
5093,America has not had an end of a wave because we have never got the virus under control enough to be less than a certain percentage of positivity.
5094,"More likely to work outdoors and not have vitamin D deficiency

More likely to be killed by other diseases if you have a weak immune system

A high birth rate and thus low mean age."
5095,"Genetics, Africans do have a more active immune system, since they live where Humans and our pathogens co-evolved and thus have a higher disease burden from their environment."
5096,They also have a much higher genetic diversity.
5097,Chill it is just a epidemic.
5098,Proof that only lunatics support trump.
5099,This.
5100,"Buckle up, cuz this is going to be an absolutely fucking brutal winter."
5101,You ain't the only one...
5102,In NY we left lockdown when we had cases down and tracing set up.
5103,"Most of the country, however, has been using the ""I don't believe the WET PAINT sign, I'm gonna touch it and find out"" method."
5104,"Schools and kindergartens remain open, however bars and restaurants should be closed and events should be canceled."
5105,"I’ve often heard anti-maskers claim they don’t know anyone who’s had it, and thus it must be a hoax"
5106,Don't like Trump either but don't know what this means
5107,Douchbagery

5120,You're probably getting a different strain every time you fly.

5122,Poland has 13291 people hospitalized and 1078 people on ventilator while we have 5613 hospitalized (1 day outdated data) and 461 on ventilator (current data).
5123,Yet Poland has lower 7-day average of new cases.
5124,"In per capita terms Czechia is in worse situation, but we detect larger % of infections and we are in soft-lockdown, so situation in Poland will be likely worse in Poland in week or two."

5185,Heard someone mention that it’s possible we are seeing these “waves” happen right in line with when immunity/antibodies begin to wane.
5186,"So, another explanation could be that India *currently* has higher levels of immunity- enough to temporarily stop rising cases from rising."
5187,But that will end in roughly 5 months.
5188,"(8 months immunity)

Unfortunately, I feel like that’s a more probable explanation."
5189,I definitely don’t feel like it’s evidence enough to imply herd immunity.
5190,There are just way too many factors at play to conclude that.
5191,It’s not triple blinded so *someone* knows what’s going on - this usually means the stats weenies or a clinical trial management committee of some kind can see how the test and control groups are doing while the actual researchers are kept in the dark.
5192,(“Double blind” is ambiguous - I can’t find out who in the research group has been blinded to what info nor how effectively).

5341,With no evidence.
5342,No data.
5343,Something as obvious as saying different countries are not the same is so mind blowingly obvious that asking for a source is like asking for a paper proving that water is wet.
5344,"Now if experts are comparing the countries, so be it."
5345,We are not.
5346,"&gt;That’s not what I mean, and you know it."

5380,"The ""deadly"" virus that kills only a small percentage of old and already sick people."
5381,Watch as they say that the vaccine only works for a small limited amount of time.
5382,The vaccines will be cheap but countries will have to buy plenty of them.
5383,Vaccines are meant to drive your economy down even more.
5384,Philantropy and money/power never go together.
5385,This year has had some of the best weather in a lifetime.
5386,No real winter this year has saved many tourism operators and helped suppress colds and flus.

5388,This is a fact we’ve accepted for literally all of humanity.
5389,"If attitudes about that didn’t change after the Spanish Flu, they certainly won’t change with this virus."
5390,Have you already had coronavirus?
5391,"If not, this is an extremely stupid plan."
5392,The vaccine has gone though all standard safety trials.
5393,Coronavirus is the unknown here.
5394,It's possible coronavirus is causing permanent heart damage in 70% of people.
5395,There is 0 evidence to suggest this vaccine has any risks.
5396,You're choosing likely risks over unlikely risks.
5397,Why does anything matter?
5398,"Because they aren’t that risky, and the societal cost of no school is astronomical."
5399,Perfect match for the COT (Cult of Trump).
5400,&gt; That's because they were hit first and the densest area of the country.
5401,"Yes, and that's why I used it as an example."
5402,&gt; 2 major causes that lead to death with this virus.
5403,"Not being able to breath, and being on a ventilator too long causing an infection leading to death."
5404,That isn't true.
5405,A lot of time it is attacking the heart which is what makes the lung function diminish.
5406,Also cytokine storms.
5407,"&gt;We found that septic shock and multi organ failure was the most common immediate cause of death, often due to suppurative pulmonary infection."
5408,"&gt; in a cytokine storm, levels of certain cytokines soar far beyond what’s needed, and immune cells start to attack healthy tissues."
5409,"Blood vessels leak, blood pressure drops, clots form, and catastrophic organ failure can ensue."
5410,Can't find the data at the moment but I believe only a fraction of covid deaths are even from patients who went on a ventilator at this point.
5411,&gt;80% of patients on their deathbed who were already on approved covid drugs and were still getting worse were able to return to their families within days.
5412,Absolutely false.
5413,Probably it¡s incredibly difficult to get non bias information
5414,&gt; I'd also predict that those younger students would be more likely to comply with any sort of distancing regulations that might have to be imposed.
5415,What's quite strange about this is that other people have predicted that older students would be more likely to comply.

5423,Paying for college is a pipe dream.
5424,I go go on.
5425,Black people are already vastly more likely to catch Covid and die from it then white people.
5426,"You will find that many of these same students do not want to go back to school because they know, they will be most effected by it."
5427,The gap was already getting wider and would continue to do so without Covid.
5428,Didn't we already know this from security people getting killed because they told people to put on a mask to go into the store?
5429,That's why I won't confront anyone that doesn't wear a mask.
5430,And probably why I've seen managers stop telling people to cover their mouth and nose.
5431,It's stupid.
5432,Such as after an unforeseen side effect leads to such a scenario?
5433,It’s a valid concern.

5447,His job is to go Rah!
5448,Rah!
5449,Let’s go team!
5450,and the FDAs is to approve safe drugs.
5451,You can make good attempts by looking at similar vaccines which we do have good data about and understanding the mechanisms by which specific chemicals interact with the body.
5452,A vaccine will not be approved if scientists have some evidence that something in a vaccine may cause long term effects.
5453,"However, you do not know for sure until you have observed it in said timescale."
5454,Most vaccines are planning to be released based upon Emergency Authorisation which is based on a risk reward assessment.

5460,"If parents aren't good enough at being parents to raise a kid (bar some sort of physical handicap or learning disability) that can stay at home by themselves and complete their work by age eleven, that's their problem, not society's."
5461,"As others in this thread have mentioned, a lot of what's been highlighted as a negative consequence of going remote was happening in schools before the pandemic."
5462,Now it's just out in the open for everyone to see.
5463,"Since the passage of No Child Left Behind, students have been able to do little to no work and get moved along until high school graduation anyhow."

5473,"Ok, get a combo flu/Covid shot"
5474,The fact that we’re nearly 7 1/2 months in and we’re not seeing widespread reports of reinfection is a very good thing.
5475,The KN95s that I got from eBay fit way better than the duckbill N95s my friend brought me from her hospital in February.

5527,I agree with what you've written but not wearing a mask is not the same as wilfully exposing others to a deadly virus.

5593,The study asked people about their *views* on certain measures like masks and social distancing.
5594,"From that, they drew conclusions about *actions."
5595,"* 

&gt; Three questions assessed adherence: 

- “Do you think it is necessary to avoid approaching people as much as possible until the coronavirus situation is controlled?” (social distancing),

- “Do you think it is necessary to wash your hands and/or use alcohol gel as many times a day until the coronavirus situation is controlled?” (hygiene), and 

- “Do you think it is necessary to use facemask (that protects nose and mouth) in Brazil?” (facemask)."
5596,"These questions ask for **opinions,** not about actions."
5597,They do not warrant any conclusion whatsoever about the individual’s actions.
5598,"For example, there’s a local road with a 25 mph speed limit."
5599,"Based on the size of the road and intersections and the buildings around it, etc, I think that it is unnecessary to drive 25 mph there - I think it is stupid and that 40 mph is a more appropriate speed for the conditions."
5600,"However, I still drive at 25 mph on that road."
5601,"If you asked me, 

&gt; Do you think it is necessary to drive 25 mph on that road?"
5602,My answer would be a vehement no.
5603,"That tells you *nothing* of my actions, and if you used my opinion on whether it is necessary to guess my actions, you’d be absolutely wrong."

5619,But it does not follow with her everyone who resists the masks has these tendencies or doesn't care about others.
5620,"It's the extrapolation which is propaganda, the implied assertion being anyone who is not going along with the current dystopian measures is a bad person rather than someone who just has a different opinion."
5621,It's a way of getting you to fall in line.
5622,Whether or not it is the correct thing to do for masks.
5623,Propaganda is just the technique it doesn't necessarily mean it's for a purpose which is bad.

5898,"I’d love to see a study on mask usage and general intelligence, though I could imagine the results pretty easily."
5899,How would that be conducted?
5900,Maybe a questionnaire of “general knowledge” and some problem solving type questions?
5901,It will probably be better for us if she is.
5902,Experts say real daily numbers of infected people may be 6-10x higher than number of positive tests.
5903,On average over 20% of tests is positive (AFAIK it means the epidemic is way out of control).
5904,A doctor will send you for testing only if you have SEVERAL symptoms.
5905,I personally know people who lost smell and taste and didn't qualify for testing.
5906,"Also, my sister works in a company where 50-100 people were infected (employees + their families, she included), yet there was only one person tested."
5907,Of cours he had a positive result.
5908,So only 1 infected person in statistics.

5933,About 20% of the people that get the virus will require hospitalization.
5934,Once the hospitals are overwhelmed they will reject new patients.
5935,**EVERY PATIENT THAT NEEDS TO BE HOSPITALIZED THAT ISN'T HOSPITALIZED WILL DIE.
5936,"**     

Hospitals will run out of supplies if they remain overwhelmed for weeks at a time."
5937,Which means that even hospitals won't be able to save patients.
5938,We could easily see the Case Fatality Rate increase to as much as 18%.
5939,"Which means if 1 Million people were to get infected 180,00 will die at minimum."
5940,If 10 Million get infected that means 1.8 Million will die.
5941,If you think the economy is in bad shape now wait until almost 2 people out of every 10 that get infected dies.
5942,"The entire country will come to a complete standstill, food, medicine, clean water will all become in scarce supply."

5949,Need to justify not having domestic travel restrictions?
5950,"""The regions are all the same""...

Again missing the context even though it is in the sentences you cut out."
5951,Because the situation is so different in different regions they won't place nationwide ban on elderly visitations yet and are working with the local authorities to place local bans if and when needed instead - so elderly people in Västerbotten can still get visits while the cases in Stockholm and Skåne are increasing.
5952,And about the second part... you literally cut out all the parts of that paragraph that gives you context ... like ALL of them.

5961,whos going to give people who lost their jobs the money to go get supplements?

5965,It must be something genetic because both my kids have it too.
5966,Had them tested and both have terribly low levels without supplements.
5967,"Sorry, I didn’t mean to question the fact."
5968,I was asking what people think the cause is.
5969,Especially since so many things can be a factor in these illnesses
5970,Haha.
5971,I was pretty confused there.
5972,I’m not gonna claim that as my hypothesis or try and present It as definitive or something.
5973,Its just another *possible* explanation and an interesting take that I heard.
5974,I would’ve ruled it out by now as well- I’ve just seen info on this thing go from anecdotal experiences to a covid characteristic so many times at this point that I’m not gonna rule it out either.
5975,Maybe weather?
5976,It got much warmer this week
5977,Maybe you should create a happy Covid news sub.

6027,Melbourne residents will only be allowed to shop and exercise within 5km (three miles) of their home.

6029,Only one person per household is allowed to shop for essentials at a time.
6030,"https://www.bbc.com/news/world-australia-53627038

6031,Nothing California - or any other U.S. state has done or is doing comes even close.
6032,And the lockdowns used in China and Vietnam have been tougher than Victoria's.

6153,"Not exactly on death but I found some for hospitalisations, see [this graph](https://imgur.com/a/D8mYpMD)."
6154,"The first column is current hospitalisation age distribution, second column is current ICU, the third is age distribution for those released from the hospital since the beginning (ie, survivors), and the fourth is death since the beggining."
6155,"If the virus is more agressive towards younger generations, it does not show in this data : 45% of those in hospitals are over 80, and  85% are over 60."
6156,"Still, about 20% of those in ICUs are 40 to 60, which is not unsignificant."
6157,I don't know if ICU numbers are skewed by some admission prioritisation which regards to age tough.

6159,I just had a hunch about your ideological leanings.
6160,Everyone has them.
6161,"You're also defending ACB based on her ""experience"" even though the issue isn't her experience but her extremism."
6162,That tells me a lot about what you believe.
6163,You're a scientist.
6164,Your political beliefs seem to be center-right.
6165,"You're more concerned with the factual and knowable, and you seem to think that these things win out because they're hard rules - barriers that any ideological project will run up against."
6166,And you're wrong.
6167,But hey - we're not going to convince one another.
6168,I'm hardcore pro-union.
6169,You won't be able to change my opinion because we fundamentally have different views of unions.
6170,I'm a socialist who believes that unions are how the working class exercises power.
6171,"The Chicago Teachers Union refusing to even discuss going back to in-person classes is what the workers (teachers) decided, so it's what they're fighting for."
6172,"That they can do this is, in my view, good in and of itself."
6173,"You, however, believe it's bad."
6174,Things should be done by Facts^tm and Logic^tm.
6175,"If I had to take a guess, you believe there's responsible ways for teachers and students to go back to school, but there's still risk."
6176,So the people involved just need to take that risk because that's what it is.
6177,"I believe it's up to the teachers, and they exercise that power through the union."
6178,Simple as.
6179,I didn’t pretend to be representing what the researchers claim.
6180,I was only presenting a reasonable conclusion that could be drawn from the data.
6181,"While not as strong, it is still a conclusion that doesn’t look great for anti-maskers."
6182,"Just do it, by the time you announce lockdown, it's too late already."
6183,"One, you're using anecdotal evidence to prove your point, rather then utilizing scientific evidence when you were the one demanding it in the first place."
6184,"What we know right now is...

1) Kids from the ages of 10-18 are likely just as good as drivers of the infection as young adults are."
6185,"Lots of theories about this, but the studies (particularly the Korean study) demonstrate this is a likely true statement."
6186,"2) We know that COVID-19 is likely airborne under special circumstances, which is in enclosed spaces with prolonged exposure, and when there's inadequate ventilation and air handling."
6187,These are all circumstances that are present in schools.
6188,3) Most schools that the New York Times focuses on are schools in areas where there is low community transmission.
6189,"In areas where there is high community transmission, the state refuses to allow those schools to release data, or is pressuring them heavily not to release data."
6190,Most school admins in those areas are pressuring parents not to go test and simply to quarantine.
6191,"To say with authority that schools are not the drivers of the pandemic is false; they aren't the drivers when community transmission is low, but Isreal showed that when you have high community transmission the virus can explode out of control in school settings."
6192,"Also, Texas has been in session for a few months now, and there have been multiple outbreaks down here, and the numbers continue to climb dramatically."
6193,"[https://dshs.texas.gov/coronavirus/schools/texas-education-agency/](https://dshs.texas.gov/coronavirus/schools/texas-education-agency/)

Mind you, this is with both the state and local governments actively suppressing the numbers in any way possible that they can, with school districts also desperately attempting to keep numbers down so they do not have to shut down and lose funding."
6194,"And no, I'm not insulting you."
6195,I'm stating that a person who touts that they believe in science and works in the field of virology should know better then to use anecdotal evidence and make sweeping general statements.
6196,"Another thing worth noting is that people who are anti-social or don't care about others are obviously going to gravitate toward being anti-mask, but that doesn't automatically mean all anti-mask people are anti-social."
6197,I'm opposed to mask mandates due to mental side effects that come from them.
6198,I'm opposed to lockdowns because I'm sympathetic for the working class people that are disproportionately affected by them.
6199,Just because other people oppose them for purely selfish reasons doesn't mean I do.
6200,"Likewise while there's a lot of people who support mask mandates and lockdowns for the purely selfless reason of preventing COVID deaths, there are some people who support them for selfish reasons (Masks as a coping mechanism for body image issues, lockdowns to collect unemployment checks and stay inside without FOMO, moral superiority, etc)."
6201,That doesn't mean everyone who supports lockdowns is selfish.
6202,They're toast.

    26/10/2020	922

That is Friday, Saturday, Sunday and Monday."
6217,"The total for those four days is 4,786."
6218,"But on Friday alone, the total was 1,870."
6219,&gt;Also they tested only 40 % compared to now (12 % positivity).
6220,"Actually, in week 26 they tested 75,151 people (PCR) while in week 42 they tested 148,267 (PCR)-  so that's 50.7%, not 40%."
6221,"Also, the positive rate was 10.2% not 12% in week 22, while in week 42 it was 3.86%."
6222,I don’t like people but I still wear a mask.

6267,"&gt;People who had recovered, including those no longer reporting symptoms, exhibited significant cognitive deficits when controlling for age, gender, education level, income, racial-ethnic group and pre-existing medical disorders."
6268,"They were of substantial effect size for people who had been hospitalised, but also for mild but biologically confirmed cases who reported no breathing difficulty."
6269,"&gt;  
&gt;Our analyses provide converging evidence to support the hypothesis that COVID-19 infection likely has consequences for cognitive function that persist into the recovery phase."
6270,"The observed deficits varied in scale with respiratory symptom severity, related to positive biological verification of having had the virus even amongst milder cases, could not be explained by differences in age, education or other demographic and socioeconomic variables, remained in those who had no other residual symptoms and was of greater scale than common pre-existing conditions that are associated with virus susceptibility and cognitive problems."
6271,"&gt;  
&gt;The scale of the observed deficits was not insubstantial; the 0.57 SD global composite score reduction for the hospitalised with ventilator sub-group was equivalent to the average 10-year decline in global performance between the ages of 20 to 70 within this dataset."
6272,It was larger than the mean deficit of 512 people who indicated they had previously suffered a stroke (-0.40SDs) and the 1016 who reported learning disabilities (-0.49SDs).

No,  I'm saying it's propaganda in part because that is the intented takeaway."

6921,"Do NOT, under any circumstances, do that."
6922,"Once you have it, you cannot control the outcome or course of the disease, and most importantly you cannot control who you may pass that infection to."
6923,"As for the risk of exposure at your practice, you should be following CDC guidelines of screening all patients for temperature, symptoms, and questionnaire with the standard covid screening questions, before admitting any patient into your facility."
6924,"You should also don appropriate ppe while treating any patient, and mandate the use of a mask at all times by all individuals in your facility."
6925,"However, keep in mind that this was exactly the time when it got cold in Europe again and people started meeting indoors instead of parks."
6926,In Germany the outbreak was pretty much perfectly timed with the summer weather abruptly endimg.

6936,"So, just wear your mask and hope for a vaccine?"
6937,"As more people are evicted and desperation grows in those that are required to work in large groups, we will see more sensationalist media, villainizing anyone ready to return to work."

6947,"Narcissistic, Oppositional Defiant, and Antisocial Personality disorders, for three."
6948,I think the other person's point is that the country should have improved the mental health care that asylums failed to provide instead of getting rid of them and doing nothing at all.
6949,It's one nasty cold the CCP cooked up.

6951,Antibodies for covid are being maintained six months post infection.

6954,"Number of infected and hospitalized people are slightly trending upwards, so hopefully the new restrictions announced yesterday will help keep the numbers in check."
6955,"I know it’s a cheap POS, but how is it not technically one when they are exactly what the acronym stands for."
6956,"A PAPR (powered air purifying respirator) is a battery-powered blower that provides positive airflow through a filter, cartridge, or canister to a hood or face piece."
6957,"It’s a battery powered blower, it provides positive filtered airflow to a face piece."

Technically true for society, but a 90% effective vaccine is still 90% effective for those who choose to take it on an individual level."

7372,More like not do stupid shot that lies past that line.
7373,That's what leadership looks like.
7374,I wonder why it’s just moms who are being blamed for this...
7375,"Yea, it's extremely serious."
7376,Hospitals overflowing will have deadly consequences.
7377,"But ""everyone will die"" is too strong a statement"
7378,Just like how the virus hates racism so you won’t get infected at protests?
7379,What the eck is wrong with people?
7380,This is horrifying.
7381,I suppose that would be better for NYC in economically than implementing a 14 day quarantine on arrival as some states and countries require.

7387,El Paso has literally run out of beds and has ordered a curfew.
7388,"DFW is also averaging anywhere from 11 to 15% on any given day, so it's really only a matter of time before DFW reaches the same level of El Paso."

7390,Omg you finally admitted you’re wrong.
7391,It’s a damn miracle.
7392,Up til this point you were just refusing to read/acknowledge the evidence and instead twist one particular statement Fauci made.
7393,Point is; anyone who doesn’t comply is being selfish.
7394,This dude (whom I have blocked now because of his toxicity/harassment) just admitted he’d rather see one out of a hundred people die just so he could go to a sporting event.
7395,No other word other than selfish
7396,&gt; Some Toronto-area hospitals are nearing 100 per cent capacity as they grapple with both COVID-19 cases and other patients.
7397,My guess would be that since we weren't prepared for the pandemic it was physically impossible to scale up testing resources.
7398,Then the job won't be done lol
7399,"well that is one way to shut him up, I reckon."
7400,We have 4 cases in schools of the Montgomery township School district here in NJ.
7401,"But due to what the superintendent calls effective contact tracing, elementary school that had a case is staying open for hybrid learning, But the high school is going virtual because too many teachers are in contact with the individual."
7402,"And here I am, a paraprofessional in kindergarten who struggles staying six feet away from a kindergartner all of them having trouble with their masks always needing help."
7403,The teachers are on edge here.
7404,They really want to go virtual again
7405,This would be the perfect scenario for group testing.

7438,Lol.
7439,Meaningless phrase.
7440,Not wearing a mask isn’t a protected class.
7441,There’s no arbitrary discrimination at work here.
7442,I see you have a weird hardon for the phrase “find some reason” in the OPs comment but that doesn’t make it any more or less legal to not hire the person.
7443,Sorry.

7446,Yes sir.

7450,after Ever's stay at home order was overturned this spring?
7451,"I've said it before and I am saying it again: Number of cases now cannot be compared to the spring numbers, due to huge differences in testing."
7452,"Back then, only those in hospitals and those with critical jobs (e.g."
7453,"medical staff) were tested, now all adults with any symptoms can easily get tested."
7454,"As an example of how misleading that graph is: By all other metrics (hospitalizations, ICU admission, reported deaths, excess mortality) it is very clear the peak was actually in April, and then it has been steadily decreasing until at least August."
7455,"Your graph makes it look like the peak was in June, while it is actually just that it was in June the testing was finally ramped up to somewhat decent levels."
7456,"So, cases were probably rising a lot faster back in March/April, it's just that we have no data to back it up with as there was nowhere near enough testing."
7457,Exactly my point.
7458,I always suggest to my right wing friends that they move somewhere truly right wing.
7459,I even offer to pay and find a way for them to get there.
7460,"Surprisingly, not *one* of them has taken me up on the offer!"

Also, here are some helpful resources that depict the spike in hospitalizations we are facing:

[Hospitalizations broken down by region - absolute](https://covidtracking.com/data/charts/regional-current-hospitalizations)

[Hospitalizations broken down by region - per capita](https://covidtracking.com/data/charts/regional-cases-per-million)

This provides an alarming picture for where we are headed (Midwest especially if you look at per capita)."

7471,At the end of the day they’re just saying what should happen yes.
7472,Do I agree maybe we should mask it up and distance after a vaccine?
7473,Yeah probably that’s what SHOULD happen if you’re directly trying to confront covid.
7474,"But in a general sense, I think with all the secondary issues it’s causing and the plunge in mental health across the globe etc, it just wont play out like that."

7481,"Businesses have to open, I mean I’m all for a shutdown if hospitals are overwhelmed but it was time to reopen in Europe!"
7482,The thing is though that not everyone follows the rules.
7483,Some businesses/stores/shops are lenient about mask usage.
7484,On top of that people are violating social distance and private gathering rules and taking things to the extreme.
7485,"College and schools have also reopened is also a factor but the truth is that universal mask usage and social distancing would NOT lead to Europe’s and especially Frances numbers, people are fucking up, en masse."

7535,"This sounds like a miracle considering this guys statements but you can check it here:

7536,So it has almost 5 months running.
7537,"If things were as this guy is suggesting, Spain would have already imploded."
7538,Growth has been linear (which means infection was badly controlled but not completely out of control) almost all other European countries has an exponential growth...
7539,So big that in just 1.5 months (since 2nd wave started there) they have much worse numbers than Spain.
7540,- speaking region by region.
7541,Almost all Spanish regions were able to contain previous outbreaks by implementing mild measures.
7542,"You can check region by region historical data here:

Data actually suggest that Spain has certain experience in lowering numbers without dramatic measures."
7543,I'm not saying Spain is performing awesomely well.

7546,They are currently performing better than most European countries.

7550,"&gt;The researchers found that 82 per cent of the hospitalized COVID-19 patients (who were not taking supplements) were vitamin D deficient, while 47 per cent of the control group had the same deficiency."
7551,Lol interesting response to something I never said.
7552,But okay.
7553,"Surveys are accepted, certainly, although also recognized as fairly weak and subject to tremendous limitations."
7554,"However, I never objected to the use of a survey."
7555,The stated objective of the question was to **assess adherence** to various measures.
7556,"If we’re going to use a survey to do that assessment, we should ask something that in fact reveals something about the respondent’s adherence to various measures, right?"
7557,"So if you want to know if someone *adheres* to a requirement/law/best practice of doing X, it makes sense to ask: 

&gt; Do you do X?"
7558,And similar questions directed toward the individuals actions regarding X.
7559,"If the objective were to assess **opinions** of a requirement/law/best practice of doing X, it makes sense to ask:  

&gt; Do you think it is important to do X?"
7560,Do you see the distinction?
7561,"If the stated goal is to assess action, you ask questions about actions."
7562,"If the stated goal is to assess opinion, you ask questions about opinion."
7563,"If the stated goal is to assess actions, and you ask questions about opinions, then you’re practicing junk science."
7564,"Anti-social behavior is defined as having hostility towards others, open or otherwise."

7568,"That depends on what 100% is, supplements often treat 400IU as daily dose, an insufficient amount, so 600% is only 2400IU, not much."
7569,You need crazy levels of vitamin D to overdose.
7570,One political party for decades has been more interested in expanding and consolidating power than serving the people.

7572,Tragic story but NBC news get your shit together and report on the facts after they are made available instead of using the word apparently.
7573,This is the one social study that actually didn’t seem obvious to me...I honestly would have expected the opposite.
7574,Generally I find people who are more introverted and quiet are generally thinking constantly about something and assessing all outcomes before coming to a conclusion.
7575,More reserved and accept things tentatively until further investigation.
7576,It's more about being distracted than having an opinion.
7577,Those people wouldn't disagree with the necessity of wearing masks in the survey.
7578,Serious question but have you worked in the mental health field?
7579,Humans are *wired* to be able to think about and foresee bad things happening and have a hard time visualizing the possibilities of good things happening.
7580,"It's literally why we have anxiety, and depression."
7581,This isn't just some weird subreddit feature and this phenomena can be seen widely.
7582,"In fact, thinking things will be good in the face of evidence to the contrary can be seen in people with several disorders such as gambling and risk taking."
7583,They can see that another scratch-off probably won't win them the jackpot but they feel the small shred of possibility that they will as being the greater factor.
7584,"Those who did comply were found to be more obedient, easily manipulated, and probe to call out and cancel culture"
7585,It might not be important on an individual basis - after all most people recover from the flu fine.
7586,"It’s like having a fire extinguisher in your kitchen - most people are fine for decades without one, they can use a pot lid or baking soda for small incidents - but some people really ought to have one either because they cook a lot or they are not careful."
7587,You don’t think having an extinguisher by the stove is important unless you know someone who has lost a kitchen or a house to a grease fire.
7588,And that’s not very likely.
7589,I still think CNN has had more anchors testing positive for the virus.
7590,"It's complicated news, actually."
7591,"It's good that a vaccine is coming along, but issuing emergency use authorization has implications for the completion of trials (both Pfizer's own and the many other efforts)."

7595,One guy on my timeline is still posting about 0% influenza admission rates and that the numbers are all fake.

7600,I’m not trick or treat this year because of Covid-19.
7601,Last year I didn’t trick or treat because I am over 30.
7602,Clearly there’s not enough proof to 100% define a relationship so they left it at that.
7603,You’re literally asking them to commit confirmation bias and skip to a conclusion that might not be there.
7604,Anecdotal evidence isn't evidence you can use to make a legitimate claim.
7605,You might see a lot of people who say they're re-infected but you have to remember that around 10% of cases are long haulers.
7606,This can include people who's symptoms go away for a period then come back.
7607,"Also, bear in mind that people posting symptoms on this sub and /r/COVID19positive have heavy selection bias."
7608,I agree confirmed cases of reinfection have very restrictive evidence.
7609,"However, we'd be seeing *something* about mass amounts of presumed reinfection if they were happening."

7683,We are now seeing why Individualism will not be the dominant paradigm in the near future and the Global West will quickly lose economic and political power to the East who care as much about each other as they do themselves.
7684,"Turns out it wasn't wars, it wasn't economic policies or political policies that made the West fall."
7685,It was simply not having a populace who automatically thought and acted as if masks were important during a plague.
7686,The East is already roaring back to normal while the West is having basic healthcare facilities overrun with no end in sight.
7687,47%.
7688,Meaning those with vitamin d deficiencies are 4x more likely to be hospitalized than those without
7689,No because in some cases the selfish asshole helps spread it and isn’t affected by it but spreads it to a good person and they die.
7690,It’s just plain old top to bottom shitfuckery.
7691,Thank you 🙏🏼
7692,That is not berry good news.
7693,They jus scienceing what we all thinking
7694,"That's questionable, and probably differs a lot between countries."
7695,"Here in Slovenia, almost all anti-maskers wear masks in public, because you can't buy food (or anything else) or use public transport without wearing one, and not wearing one in the street might get you fined."
7696,"Most people who don't wear a mask are people who are too lazy to be consistent, or are too marginalized to even know they need to wear one."
7697,"next on the News, the sky is blue and fire might be hot"
7698,"It's my understanding the underreporting in the countries you mentioned was relative to a timespan in which there was very little testing capacity and an emergency situation that forced them to take extreme measures, for example lockdowns in a few of these countries."
7699,In addition they were reporting the excess deaths themselves.. exactly for the purpose of providing proper numbers given the impossiblily to count all deaths at that time.
7700,Or for example the French government claims the numbers for new cases are probably double of what they are reporting now.
7701,Nope.
7702,We adopted perfect measures for schools and  a study shows that infections do not happen there.
7703,"Anyway, in many regions schools are totally closed and in some, students attend only for the 25% physical classes."
7704,My doctor recommended 1000 IU a day and I was deficient.
7705,After 3 months Im back to normal and still taking 1000 IU a day.
7706,60000 IU is how you get kidney stones and hypercalcemia
7707,Guess I'm not as antisocial as I thought
7708,[removed]
7709,"Assuming a correlation between anti-X beliefs and likelihood of anti-X behavior (a) isn't unreasonable and (b) doesn't challenge their ""credibility."""
7710,You're basically accusing them of intentional academic dishonesty.
7711,At most they can be accused of overstating the significance of their findings.
7712,But I kind of think you're just arguing for the sake of arguing at this point.
7713,Headlines from New Zealand are like reading about another planet right now.
7714,"Everywhere else is basically a garbage fire and they're like ""oops, one snuck through the net, we'll get that taken care of right away."""
7715,I thought anti- social meant - hating to be around a bunch of people.
7716,I like have mini panic attacks when I stay in Walmart to long.
7717,"I think you are confused - gyms are closed, live music industry is shut down, speech therapist, etc."
7718,many peoples livelihoods are outlawed
7719,And you're missing my point.
7720,The majority of the blue countries on that map are either oppressive regimes or failed states.
7721,Any reasonable country criticised the Hong Kong security law.
7722,Choosing to support the USA is the lesser of two evils to me.
7723,I would rather have the USA leading the world than some backwards communist dictatorship  lead by a malevolent prick who looks like a disney cartoon character
7724,"Its possible that Macron, and indeed other European leaders, know that lockdowns are the only way to stop the virus spreading, but have to go through the motions of trying everything else (while hospitalisations and deaths rise) in order to gather the political mandate to get it done."
7725,"This is not helped by the vociferous denialist/defeatist contingent - because of their words and actions we enter lockdown later, costing more lives, and for longer, causing more economic damage."
7726,"See what they have done, and be ready to hold them to account once this is finally over."
7727,Depends on how the election goes...if the Dems take the senate and white house I'd count on seeing a healthy stim package.
7728,Have to get with Bob and Doug McKenzie and put on their thinking toques.
7729,I am not seeing Americans following that advise
7730,"If they invade Taiwan or start firing on other military vessels in the South of China sea, it is all but inevitable."
7731,"The first shot would be theirs, but I don't see not reacting to it as a viable option."
7732,There’s 9500 hospitalizations; just 206 more than yesterday (which of course is more like 550 since you needed the first 367 to replace the dead and break even)
7733,It will be 2 weeks after Halloween.
7734,"It was rapidly going down at the time, I dont care about scores, it was the reaction I was referring to"
7735,It’s great!
7736,As far as Covid stuff we’re in a second national lockdown (720 cases today and 5 deaths) but I’m very happy to be here right now as I feel 100% safer here than in the US
7737,I mean more like Italy.
7738,They locked down and got their cases down to a handful.
7739,I don’t think St Louis locked down any harder or more effectively.
7740,It is a time issue.
7741,Are we in kindergarden?
7742,"'You're a very dumb and stupid person but i'm very smart and brave'

I dont care about keeping a distance from a stranger, that's always been the case in general nor will i throw a fit to wear a mask in a store."
7743,I will however keep resisting to call this the 'new normal' because its not normal and never will be.
7744,"Over my dead body, that's when this will become normal for me."
7745,The west has destroyed their economies.
7746,The effects?
7747,More people will die from poverty in the third world countries then the virus itselfs.
7748,Its one big domino effect.
7749,Its selfish aswell to only think about the people here.
7750,"While it's totally true that virus do not care about who you are and how old you are, it does make a difference in terms of how healthy the person was before they got sick"
7751,That looks like the same article that I shared.
7752,I have linked to a second article that mentions the origin of the worker.
7753,Yup.
7754,And like any other denier they’ll turn to real medicine when things get bad.
7755,But we don’t have enough real medicine for everyone.
7756,Maybe I can finally become a mature adult?
7757,We could all chip in to build a McDonald's.
7758,"That would cause some problems, though, because none of them would want to *work* at the McDonald's, they just want to go in and yell at the manager."
7759,"This is everyone, everywhere."
7760,People just don’t realize it.
7761,I have a neighbor who goes on and on about how terrible things are and how they Lysol and disinfect everything.
7762,Not five minutes later they are inches away from other neighbors chatting away.
7763,"I don’t get any closer than 10-15 feet, and more if possible."
7764,"Takes a lot to call one a narcissist whilst sitting there gloating about a second wave happening(which I never said wouldnt happen), fairplay."
7765,"In case anyone cares, the big news here is removing the ""new individuals tested"" category from the reports as it was the only way to accurately gauge the true positivity rate."
7766,"The way the FL DoH reports the positivity rate includes thousand of duplicate negative results but not duplicate positives (when long term care providers get tested multiple times in the course of their work, for example)."
7767,"So, I guess now we only get to know the watered down positivity rate from this point forward."
7768,"Even Johns Hopkins' report follows the new individuals tested vs. all tests, to my knowledge."
7769,That's why their percent positive is so much higher compared to the DoH.
7770,Lol anyone who whines about downvotes is an absolute tool.
7771,Especially when you’re still at plus 9 for this comment you’re whining on
7772,Wow one article trumps evidence from thousands of daily flights?
7773,"Lol, shut the fuck up you coward."
7774,"I’m gonna take the vaccine and as soon as it’s injected and I instantly die, I’m going to haunt you with the wrath of the million untested vaccines."
7775,There clearly is a relationship tho based on the data.
7776,Why are they so hesitant to just come out and say Vitamin D helps fight Covid?
7777,We all know its true
7778,Fake
7779,N95s tie in the back.
7780,It's likely California had larger number of infection in beginning before we knew what covid was.
7781,"If that is the case, it's much harder for the virus to spread now"
7782,"You asked for a source, you got one and now you're saying:

""People are just being stubborn and holding onto this one thing he said""

He's a scientist isn't he?"
7783,He lied to people.
7784,Admitted lying.
7785,"Then you have people wondering why people are ""denying the science""."
7786,Well because of asshats like this.
7787,&gt; I'm shocked by how many people can't stand him.
7788,Don't bring Trump into it.
7789,This is what this thread chain is about.. you got a great answer as to why people don't like him.
7790,"If you don't like it, that's another matter but at least you are now educated on the WHY."
7791,Some people don't like our health officials to be economical with the truth.
7792,They're weird like that ;)

7796,"I was referring to vaccines, but that was initially only emergency clearance as well."
7797,Only got full clearance recently
7798,even ones that are dragging from the beginning of the pandemic... like mines?
7799,"Yes, the Virus impacts everyone, no one is immune, but your age drastically, and health affects how it will impact you, if you are young, and healthy, with no preexisting conditions, your chances of dying are so incredibly low."
7800,"But if you are like 80+  with multiple preexisting conditions, your chances of dying rise significantly to over 1%."
7801,"If you think standard infection control protocols are ""real life ridiculousness"", you are part of the problem.. not the solution."
7802,"Human beings who can think about other human beings, especially those that are immunocompromised or vulnerable to the virus?"

They are fucking dickheads"
7807,Honestly everything is pretty much back to normal.
7808,We’re still at our ‘level 1’ and ready to move back through the levels if need be.
7809,"We did have an outbreak again, likely starting from the ports I believe, but we have enough contact tracing that that was under control straight after, and that city was appropriately put into a mini lockdown."
7810,Most of our cases at this point are just people flying into the country and in managed isolation.
7811,"But yeah, don’t really see too many people wearing masks anymore, no social distancing etc but we are encouraged to sign in with the app or pen and paper when we go to a shop or place."
7812,"But concerts and festivals are going ahead, and life pretty much back to normal besides international travel!"
7813,"Dude, sounds great for hot summers"
7814,"Facebook , that's what."
7815,There are some exceptions.
7816,You are the 1% Category.
7817,It’s not really a WWII analogy... You have to define metrics of tolerability.
7818,"Once you do that, you have a path out with a vaccine."
7819,"If 500,000+ US deaths were tolerable, we wouldn’t even be having this conversation, things would just be normal."
7820,"I suspect 100,000 is, so the goal and endpoint should be bringing COVID within that number."
7821,"Once it is, we’re back to normal."
7822,Is this what passes as science now?
7823,If only there was some kind of leadership from the top to guide these fools.
7824,"I am inclined to believe that is what you think, but it just sounds horribly rude to point out something like this."
7825,"People are dying and are stressed out, try to be more considerate when writing these types of comments (considering all the trolls that infest the Sweden-related posts)."
7826,I believe in the validity of the Swedish strategy - if we had a better support structure for the elderly in the beginning we would not even have this argument.
7827,We probably would be on the same level as Finland.
7828,"Not looking for immortality, just trying to keep my loved ones safe, especially the ones the have health conditions, and have a base level of respect for people around me."
7829,"Believe it or not, some of us have the ability to think about the well being of other people."
7830,I thought it was “definitely not safe”?
7831,How are you still standing and talking after all those dangerous flight?
7832,"&gt;Turns out it wasn't wars, it wasn't economic policies or political policies that made the West fall."
7833,It was simply not having a populace who automatically thought and acted as if masks were important during a plague.
7834,Masks being a bit more symbolic here.
7835,Masks are important...
7836,But they lose importance the more super-spreader businesses are open.
7837,Like bars.
7838,Restaurants and clubs filled to the brim with people.
7839,Yep.
7840,"China government literally force everyone from overseas to quarantine at hotel rooms for 14 days and test them everyday, but you have to pay for all the cost."
7841,Good.
7842,It's time to stop trying to tell people to put their lives and hold and start getting them the tools they need to be safe.
7843,"While it's true that Lombardy's main industry is not tourism, the sole city of Milan had 7.5M tourists in 2019 and was bracing for more than 8 in 2020."
7844,"This year the final number was expected to be around 3.5M, which will likely have to be revised lower at this point."
7845,That alone is a 3-5B € loss of income.
7846,Then add all the lakes region and the other provinces and we are talking 2/3 times that.
7847,"In all, it's roughly a 3% decrease in PIL for the region because of that alone."
7848,It definitely applies.

7850,"If the science is clear, why isn't it working?"
7851,Perhaps you're mistaking a clear hypothesis for clear science.
7852,and water is wet...
7853,"But as I posted above, the bad (and IMHO bigger news) is that Long Covid may actually turn out to be Lifetime Covid."
7854,"I'll put it this way - I, very thankfully, have not contracted COVID yet (to my knowledge, of course)."
7855,"But if I had, and I was one of the long haulers, hoping every day that I would get better and truly back to normal, my heart would have absolutely broken upon reading this story."
7856,To be fair it’s just a quote of what school officials announced.
7857,Nursing homes have come out on Tuesday and Friday the last three weeks at least.
7858,"Last Tuesday they reported 100 nursing home deaths, then Friday 114."
7859,Trust the science
7860,"Oh yes, medical tyranny."

7863,"In the Asian countries, the govts are issuing clear directions to wear masks plus Asian countries went through SARS and that's a big reason they're taking this more seriously."
7864,"The problem with Europe is that once they came out of lockdown, they then acted like the virus was eradicated and stopped wearing masks and social distancing."
7865,I remember an article about a bus driver in France who was murdered for asking a rider to wear a mask before getting on the bus.
7866,"The article featured a photo of his family at the funeral, and of course, they weren't wearing masks."

7880,Forreal lol what the fuck is going through these peoples heads.
7881,Risk assessment all out of whack.
7882,Probably never thought this much about driving a car (much more dangerous than covid for those 15-34) before the pandemic.
7883,Read the article.
7884,The treatments for Lupus and other autoimmune diseases are promising.

7896,The electrostatic filtration degrades when the mask is soiled.
7897,This is why people need to be cautious about how much they reuse masks
7898,Internet ridiculousness is less embarrassing than real life ridiculousness.

7943,By “them” I mean cities/countries/society etc as well as some individuals.
7944,The people who think they are the exception to the rule are gonna get screwed and/or fck up some other people in these Covid times.
7945,Keep inhaling common viral infections that the media swore to you were going to cause the apocalypse unless you locked yourself inside for 15...226 days and counting.

7947,"Better yet, hit the gym and stop whining"
7948,"More testing *usually* does mean *more cases*, given that a case is just a person confirmed to have covid."

7961,[removed]
7962,But no treatment?
7963,This isn’t good news.
7964,My former supervisor tried to get me to stop wearing a mask by saying “you know it doesn’t even actually help you right?
7965,Just other people.” As if that’s a bad thing
7966,control vs responsibility
7967,Hmm i live in Dublin which is the capitol so you get a pretty diverse bunch of people and loads of international students from all over the world.
7968,However it’s pretty white outside Dublin or at least to the point when my bf (Irish) visited me in the states one he was shocked by how diverse where i lived was haha.
7969,It’s definitely smaller in feel than D.C considering in 2016 the Last Irish census had the ENTIRE island at 6mill people
7970,How are they a troll?
7971,Sure what they said was a bit extreme because it's hard to blame it all on one guy but do you honestly think Trump handled Covid well?
7972,the FDA made that new rule after the press started pushing for it.
7973,I kind of wonder if a lot of “low hanging fruit” have already been wiped out...
7974,"Maybe we should just release a study that people who don’t wear masks tend to have a small penis, are bad lovers and have multiple tabs open on their phones of Justin Bieber."
7975,"My husband and I originally bought 3M half face respirators back in late Feb/early March, as I couldn't find any other masks available so it was go big or stay home."
7976,"First time we wore them, we got SO many stares and a few laughs."
7977,Eventually since other masks have become available we usually wear KN95s if we have to go anywhere (which we try to avoid doing at all).
7978,"I'm with you, as the percent is starting to go up, I'm seriously considering going back to the 3M."
7979,The only reason I can think of that I wouldn't is social; it really sticks out.

7981,"Kinda fun feeling like Vader, though."
7982,"As long as the state boarder is still open, the cases will keep going up."
7983,I work with a Pol and gotta agree with you.
7984,She thinks it’s all over blown.
7985,And she thinks all the restrictions Poland had put in place are terrible and useless.
7986,Not sure where she gets her news but if I only listened to her I would think Poland didn’t have a single Covid case.
7987,If this really mattered the entirety of the population would be infected already.
7988,"Get off your high horse, people have buy and large moved on from covid because it doesn’t impact the majority of us."
7989,Fine those fuckers 50000 a day for every day they don't comply.

7997,"That's actually hugely horrifying, and I don't know that the fact that some treatments for similar conditions may help to make less frequent the overall occurrence of symptoms really lessens how shitty this is."

8021,Crazy times.
8022,Duh
8023,lmao under no circumstances come here.
8024,&gt; I think they'd have to do a door-to-door campaign.
8025,There are three basic groups of people.
8026,The first are people who are eager to get the shot.
8027,Healthy eager people will go wherever they need to and are not an issue; just get the vaccine somewhere close to them and let them know where and when to be there.
8028,"For those who are eager but less mobile, yet are in situations with similar people (nursing homes, group homes, prisons, etc), you can send out a nurse to give the vaccine on-site."
8029,"The most problematic people in this particular group are those who are eager, but they live alone and can't get around very well."
8030,"For at least some of them, I'd expect that they'll have nurse ride-alongs with Meals On Wheels."
8031,"Some of the others will be vaccinated when they come into contact with the healthcare system, but I expect at least some of this group to be overlooked or left behind."
8032,"The second group of people are those who aren't interested in the vaccine: either they're anti-vaxxers in general, or they're against this particular vaccine (the virus is a hoax, a conspiracy, too rushed, etc)."
8033,The only way to reach them is an educational campaign.
8034,Expect to see PSA's and ads debunking common misconceptions and pushing people to get vaccinated.
8035,"[Side note: it would be lovely if the vaccine is one of the ones that's inhaled, that would help with people who are scared of needles.]"
8036,"Then there's the third group: those who are willing to consider getting vaccinated, but won't go out of their way to do so."
8037,The thing here is to make it extremely convenient for them to get vaccinated.
8038,"I fully expect to see drive-through vaccination set-ups at schools, for parents when they're dropping off or picking up their kids."
8039,"In the south and midwest, I wouldn't be surprised to see a vaccine van in the Church parking lot on Sundays; that may work with some of the Orthodox groups here in New Jersey as well."
8040,"Basically, just find where a bunch of people are naturally going in their daily lives, and go there."
8041,"&amp;nbsp;

Of more concern to me is that most of the vaccines need two doses to work, and most of them work best if the second is given at a certain point after the first."
8042,Making sure we get the second dose to people on time makes things trickier.
8043,And it'll be even harder to keep track if we end up with competing vaccines.
8044,"An issue for states with small towns far apart from each other is the issue of keeping the vaccines at the proper temperature until administration; fortunately, that's not an issue for New Jersey."
8045,And the final problem is another education issue.
8046,"The threshold for accepting a vaccine right now is that the vaccine needs to work for 50% of the people its given to, and it needs to either reduce contagiousness, OR reduce symptoms, OR reduce the death rate."
8047,So you're going to have people who get vaccinated and think that protects them entirely.
8048,"At least some of them are doomed to disappointment because the vaccine won't work on everyone, while others will still get sick despite the vaccine working in them - they just won't spread it to others, or won't be as sick as they normally would have been, or they'll get very sick but they won't die."
8049,"But all they'll see is that they got the vaccine and still got ill, so clearly the vaccine is a complete failure."
8050,"It's very much the way the flu vaccine is these days: its designed to reduce your chances of getting the flu, and to make it less severe when you do get it, but **so** many people think its entirely useless because they ""still got the flu""."
8051,[removed]
8052,Right.
8053,"Because those of you advocating shutting down the entire fucking world economy forever and sending tens [to hundreds of millions of people](https://www.oxfam.org/en/world-brink-hunger-pandemic-coronavirus-threatens-push-millions-starvation) to the brink of starvation, just so you can feel a little bit safer for a few months until the virus spreads anyway, are *totally* the altruistic ones."

8064,"If you want, you can get an antibody test to unblind yourself, you just can’t share the results with anybody in the trial."
8065,There is ONE caveat however— I’m not sure if the antibodies the vaccine produces are the same antibodies that the body produces with the natural virus.
8066,"If they are different, then the lab won’t know to look for the vaccine-specific antibodies in your blood and it will come back negative."
8067,I’ve tried asking this question around to several people and nobody seems to have a definitive answer.
8068,Happy cake day!
8069,Your 30% number is absolute horseshit.
8070,I was going to get the train to Warsaw from Berlin on my birthday in late March.

8072,Then the borders closed and everything else happened.

8124,&gt;The Imperial College London team found the number of people testing positive for antibodies has fallen by 26% between June and September.
8125,They say immunity appears to be fading and there is a risk of catching the virus multiple times.
8126,"&gt;More than 350,000 people in England have taken an antibody test as part of the REACT-2 study so far."
8127,"&gt;In the first round of testing, at the end of June and the beginning of July, about 60 in 1,000 people had detectable antibodies."
8128,"&gt;But in the latest set of tests, in September, only 44 per 1,000 people were positive."
8129,&gt;It suggests the number of people with antibodies fell by more than a quarter between summer and autumn.
8130,"&gt;”Immunity is waning quite rapidly, we're only three months after our first [round of tests] and we're already showing a 26% decline in antibodies,"" said Prof Helen Ward, one of the researchers."

8384,"Because, technically, the study hasn't been completed so, scientifically speaking, the vaccine doesn't ""work."""
8385,Not until the study is completed and the data is collected.
8386,Ending the study early for the EUA would invalidate the results and could theoretically cause damage for future research/safety.
8387,"So instead of doing an EUA that would allow those at risk to get a vaccine that science hasn't officially declared ""works,"" they want to use ""Expanded access"" for frontline workers."
8388,So the general population at-risk still wouldn't have access and the study remains uncontaminated.
8389,Their success was also due to the fact that it’s easy (relatively) for them to control the influx of people.

8628,Think of them more like spit guards.
8629,They are effective at _reducing_ the amount of large droplets emitted by a source; however they do very little for fine droplets / aerosol -- and do not seal to the face.

8671,"In a lot of places people have returned to near normal despite rising cases, continued local recommendations against it, constant reminders of the situation... and no vaccine."
8672,"When a vaccine comes out, I think that will be the rationalization for most to just ditch all safety."
8673,I can speak from experience on this to a certain extent.
8674,"I’m a part of a vaccine trial, and I suspect I got the shot."
8675,"I have a place that does antibody testing in my office building, but I intentionally haven’t done it because of the psychological aspect."
8676,"Despite not knowing if I got the vaccine, I have found myself SIGNIFICANTLY less stressed, to the point that I have to tell myself to not wander within 6 feet of people at the gym and not to go join in on pick-up basketball games I see going on at my local park."
8677,This coming from someone who has had severe anxiety during this pandemic leading to bi-weekly panic attack.
8678,It’s wild to me how just the thought of having some immune protection combined with society acting normal has just washed away like 6 months of being freaked out and taking major precautions.
8679,"Instead of putting forth efforts to act normal, it’s taking self-convincing to continue precautions."
8680,"Turns out, for me, a lifetime of normalcy really is the default I go back to easily."
8681,Almost a year of precautions hasn’t changed that.
8682,"This is to say, I think if me, an r/coronavirus redditer with major anxiety has this response... a big majority of people will to, especially if and when a vaccine is shown to give at least some level of protection."
8683,"Combine that with the fact that so many have stopped caring as much as it is, I really don’t think people are going to keep following restrictions unless the are BOTH mandated and enforced."
8684,This is the place that used the harshest enforcement measures ~ is the verdict that it was worth it?

8691,Our economy is so overleveraged we can’t afford to take a break without everything falling apart.

8728,There is no downtime in nursing because patient care is continuous.
8729,It is constant.
8730,"The nurse works 24/7, but  the *person* cannot."
8731,You won't be able to do every single task for every single patient that needs to be done during your shift.

8850,I wasn't attempting to imply otherwise.
8851,The ideal scenario though is one where we don't feel compelled to wear our masks (or physically distance) to feel safe and a safe and effective vaccine is the only chance of getting to that stage anytime soon without causing mass casualties or hospitalizations.

&gt;Prevention of infection is *not* a criterion for success for any of these vaccines."
8882,"In fact, their endpoints all require confirmed infections and all those they will include in the analysis for success,  the only difference being the severity of symptoms between the vaccinated and unvaccinated."
8883,"Measuring differences amongst only those infected by SARS-CoV-2 underscores the implicit conclusion that the vaccines are not expected to prevent infection, only modify symptoms of those infected."

8894,If anything I'm a bit surprised there isn't more fatigue.
8895,Can't really blame politicians or experts either I think.
8896,It was a long time since we had a pandemic on this scale.
8897,"Science is messy and they didn't have all the answers, and still don't."
8898,Usually these disagreements and discussions is had within obscure journals and scientific conferences that the general public never reads or attends.
8899,"But the public and media clamored for any information at all and anyone who would say anything was heard and their answer's was picked apart and condensed to be easily digestible, with the expected loss of details and nuance."
8900,"And while I think countries need to have plans for pandemics, people need to realize that not all pandemics are equal."
8901,"Fatality rate, how the disease is transmitted, who are most affected, etc will play a huge role in what the response from authorities and the general public will be."
8902,The HIV pandemic is handled in a completely different manner than covid-19 and if we have a pandemic with a fatality rate of +10% (which is the case for some bird flu viruses) and/or children is very vulnerable there will be another response from the authorities and the public than what we are seeing today.
8903,They should probably require/provide n95 and n100 masks for air travel and stagger drinks/dining on long flights so that people who are unmasked to eat/drink aren't next to other unmasked people.

8995,That’s insane
8996,"Imagine this is World War 2 and our leaders are saying:

""The Nazi regime is just too strong, we are just going to have to live in it, they will never be defeated""."

8999,Will there be a shift in global currencies if everyone else is also printing money at the same time?

9003,"Exactly, Hong Kongers had SARS ptsd and everyone immediately started wearing masks when covid started becoming bad in China."

9027,"I’m a bit of an introvert, but made my living as a performer, musician, and dj."
9028,"I enjoyed entertaining crowds of people, but also enjoyed the safety of the stage or Dj booth."
9029,"I miss a lot of things, but I’ve had no major desire to go out and party since that was my job for over a decade."
9030,"If it weren’t for the crippling anxiety, I might have actually enjoyed this year off - although I’m lucky I live in a country that’s taking care of its people so that helps..."
9031,Kevin would be the best match.
9032,"Our states would be equivalent to your countries in this example though, and the better comparison for the US as a whole is the EU."
9033,"Your analogy of the pond is a good one, but the individual state numbers are the better ones to look at, especially since the response has mostly been handled at the state and local level."
9034,"You need to stop caring about ""cases"" and remember that deaths are the metric you're supposed to be watching."
9035,[Sweden's deaths flatlined months ago](https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/country/sweden/).
9036,So far this year Sweden has basically zero excess mortality.
9037,Whoever's telling you that Sweden is doing badly is a fear merchant.
9038,"I don't know if you've actually spoken to any Swedes, but they're back to living their normal lives, not that they ever really stopped."
9039,YOU are the one repeating lies.
9040,It's easier to fool someone than to convince them that they've been fooled.
9041,Big pharma is making BILLIONS right now from Covid.
9042,A: typical ICUs operate at ~75% capacity normally just for normal ICU necessary illnesses and injuries.
9043,Beds have been added to increase the ICU capacity but there is only so much staff to go around.
9044,"B: You have not had any freeDumbs taken away, you are just bitching about having to wear a simple piece of fabric over your face to try to save lives...."
9045,"Off topic here but ""Eric"" is the male version of ""Karen?"""
9046,A lot of districts have allowed those to go back in person.
9047,"They are being affected long term too and how to make up for almost almost 8 months ongoing is going to be tough, some have severely regressed too."
9048,"I understand in pandemic times it is about who is more important to preserve, and disabled are as usual getting the wrong end of the stick, not like they were valued this much in the end if it wasn't for laws, you know the ADA."

Same thing can be told for essential workers in grocery stores or hospitals, it has been decided that they aren't deserving hazard pay raise to keep the country moving."

9052,"So yeah I will voice up against my district closing again should they decide to do so, I am advocating for my daughter the same way any group advocate for themselves."
9053,It will be for a judge to decide who is right or wrong
9054,My whole thing isn’t to get back soon.
9055,"It’s to start planning things now so next fall, this year’s situation of being unprepared doesn’t happen again."
9056,But no one seems to care about making education a priority because of their privilege and bias.
9057,We don’t know if this is a one year thing.
9058,I don’t even think half of us expected this to last seven months.
9059,So I really don’t think your only a year argument is fair unless you’re a psychic.

9071,"People of Idaho continuously demonstrate that they don’t believe in COVID, or masks, or education, or reason."
9072,Even the officials in charge of health rules are like “I don’t think these people are getting sick from COVID.”

9079,It’s not social distancing that’s the issue .
9080,It’s the  virus  that’s destroying the global economy.
9081,Ffs.
9082,We’re in the third trimester of the first wave in the first semester’s wave of waves.

9086,And I already told you I never lived there.
9087,I don't understand the repetition.
9088,Petty crimes still happen in Japan and everywhere in the world.
9089,"I apologise if I assumed wrong, but are you a man?"
9090,You said have little worry about your personal safety in Japan.
9091,I just assume you never have to experience it because I know for a fact that a lot of women in Japan are constantly living in fear of sexual harassment and assault.
9092,Isn't it why they have carts for women only in their railways?
9093,Because the groping and hidden cameras are so bad they have to create a safe space for women?
9094,I don't doubt it's more unsafe in the US than in Japan.
9095,"Objectly, the US does have more violent crime rate especially when it comes with firearms."
9096,I'm sorry you have to worry about getting stabbed by a junkie.
9097,But don't use it as an argument and portrait Japan as the safest place on earth and everything is just rainbows and unicorns.
9098,You know you're exaggerating.
9099,"And in the end, all I'm saying is that you should always take precautions no matter how safe you think your surroundings are."
9100,You saying everyone doesn't need to be careful with their belongings because no one stole your stuff when you're in Japan is like telling people they don't have to wear seatbelts because you never been in a car accident and you never have to worry about flying out of the car.
9101,Being careful never hurts.
9102,Because the government is trash and can't do its job?
9103,Still doesn't mean teachers should just let themselves be exposed to covid.
9104,It’s Chad.
9105,It’s always been Chad.
9106,But Greg is also a good one or Ken or Brad 🤔
9107,"FFS, all our privileges are showing since we're not stuck in a hospital gasping for our last breaths."
9108,The rush to reopen coming from some very obviously frivolous leaderps makes me question the good faith of this whole debate.I think schools and children could alike adapt to online or hybrid instructions.
9109,"Regardless, a little more caution amidst  pandemic seems warranted."
9110,definitely getting reported by someone who isn't me
9111,Stocks dropped because of less of chance of stimulus.
9112,That's it.
9113,It doesn't care about coronavirus.
9114,I wish I could make it stop.
9115,He has no idea what fucking wave we are in.

9120,Your lack of good communication skills is showing.
9121,"&gt;A multicentre series of 26 patients with COVID-19 and either ischaemic or haemorrhagic events reported that 27% were younger than 50 years.16 Additionally, the report stated that two of 15 patients with large vessel stroke were younger than 50 years and without previous stroke risk factors."
9122,"In this study, consistent with other case series, patients with COVID-19 fare worse in terms of clinical outcomes than patients with stroke who do not have COVID-19.6,  12 This is probably related, in part, to the COVID-19 disease process."
9123,"There seems to have been a 7x increase in a very rare occurrence, so the 7x increase is still only affecting a small number of people."
9124,I do.
9125,I grew up proud to be American.
9126,I'm proud of so much that we've achieved and that we can do.
9127,I'm not proud of how we act and I wish that wasn't so.
9128,This is a surprisingly bad article for NPR.
9129,Wtf
9130,&gt; you can find a study that says anything you want.
9131,"they have others showing the opposite


We are all living the reality showing the opposite."
9132,The fast rising correlation in timing for *both* the EU and US is too direct to justify keeping schools open.
9133,"*Maybe* we are wrong about schools, but I would strongly wish we had kept more control groups out there to truly pull a good experiment."
9134,"The Chad would wear a mask and socially distance at all times

The virgin anti-intellectual is weak and sickly due to lack of vaccines as a child and refuses to wear a mask"
9135,"The government took action, the people didn't care tho"
9136,"I think Fauci is correct, numbers never were under control to call an end to any wave, but it really does not matter what you call it."
9137,It's getting a lot worse.
9138,"There was an initial peak and then fell, another peak &amp; another fall."
9139,Now daily cases have surpassed both previous peaks by some margin.
9140,"The 7 day rolling average for cases only fell to around 20,000 after the first peak."
9141,"Then down to about 35,000 after the second peak."
9142,"7 day rolling average case numbers now at about 71,000. https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/country/us/"
9143,And Epidemiologists say there are no waves?
9144,What?
9145,[You cant see a resemblance to waves there?
9146,](https://imgur.com/a/3cLPfNp)
9147,Completely unrelated to covid - I never knew it was an issue anywhere.
9148,"Again, I'd never even heard of people getting a 'flu shot' until I moved to the UK."
9149,"It just seemed like one of those things everyone deals with every couple years, you stay in bed for a week and that's that."
9150,"Edit; sorry, got my comments mixed up here."
9151,Getting a few wonderful messages from people who have apparently decided I'm some kind of problem somehow.
9152,"Anyway, thank you for your answer and stay safe."
9153,You're not coming across well.
9154,Put a mask on.
9155,At what point does the economic and mental health costs become too much?
9156,"This virus is bad, but destroying the economy and mental health for years to come is worse."
9157,It is the third wave if you have eyes and have seen the cases graph
9158,There is an inherent fuzziness to these notions that may not be immediately (or ever) apparent to literal-minded folks.
9159,nah this is an objectively poor article
9160,"That's a pretty dumb statement, considering the likes of germany do quite well."
9161,"Haha, it's nice to know I'm not the only one doing these things!"
9162,Definitely feels like it sometimes here in AZ.
9163,Stay safe!
9164,"This subreddit loves to disagree with all expert public health opinion when it comes to schools, but I appreciate your rational response."
9165,"There are a heap of options lying around that worked in east Asia, but they require an active, engaged citizenry who nonetheless obey realistic rules, and a government that works for the people, not profits."
9166,"I don't think lockdowns are a bad idea anymore with these rising rates, but there are so many better options than reopening schools, workplaces, and bars while crossing one's fingers."
9167,"According to https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/

Spain has 24,732 cases / million people

South Korea has 508 cases / million people."
9168,They have a respect for educated people.
9169,So not surprising that they are doing so well.
9170,&gt; groups work together to get children and teachers back to classrooms safely?
9171,and here is the problem.
9172,One group doesn't want to put them in safely.
9173,"They're having kids go back to school with masks not being mandatory, no (or not enough) safety measures set up, and way too early."
9174,"&amp;nbsp;

I've outlined when it would be ""safe"" (safer...not ideal but what can you do)."
9175,Once real treatment is out.
9176,Once vaccines are out.
9177,"Personally, the treatments are looking like the safer thing."
9178,"Once they start to roll out, then we can safely start going into the classrooms with protections, guidelines, etc."
9179,"But your focus is ""get back soon""."
9180,"It just can't be like that AND be ""safe""."
9181,"&amp;nbsp;

I'd be more willing to go back if the treatments were released and readily available."
9182,Vaccines...less so but its another compromise.
9183,"&amp;nbsp;

&gt;If a student or teacher is in this group or don’t want to come back, continue online."
9184,"If a student or teacher is more likely safe that not and want to go in person, go in person."
9185,Not enough personnel for that.
9186,You'd need teachers for distance learning AND at school.
9187,"As I mentioned earlier, my school is setting up systems in which we'll be able to target both, but in all honesty, we're going to be paying even LESS attention to the ones online because now we need to concentrate with online students and in-class students."
9188,Trying to tie them together but that's just dividing the class up more.
9189,&gt;What are the statistics saying and for those more at risk what can we do to protect them?
9190,"Social distancing, masks, cleaning, not being in closed quarters with others."
9191,"A school, even with half capacity days, would still not allow for this."
9192,And kids are still kids and will slip up more often than adults when it comes to masks/cleaning.
9193,"&amp;nbsp;

You're talking about economically, intellectually, and mentally and I'm talking about health and death."
9194,One of those should take precedence over the other.
9195,Especially if it is  a 1 year thing.
9196,"&amp;nbsp;

I see treatments coming out sooner than later."
9197,Vaccines are much trickier and I think they'll be held out longer until stronger versions are developed.
9198,"&amp;nbsp;

As for the privilage."
9199,"Look, I want to live."
9200,I want my students to live.
9201,I want my students' family members to live.
9202,"It would mightily be desasterous if someone died from covid19 (or because of complications it causes on other conditions) because ""they needed to be back at school""."
9203,"&amp;nbsp;

Our fundamental difference is that you think kids need to be in school NOW because of the social and educational purposes while I think we can provide enough to educate from home and not spreading the virus...and it WILL spread."
9204,I agree with you that a long term plan will have to include going back to school.
9205,"However, you seem to think we're already in the ""long term""."
9206,"Nah, this is still recent."
9207,Long term is more than a year for me.
9208,"&amp;nbsp;

&gt;Is that an excuse to let people fall behind

a pandemic and possible death is a perfectly good excuse."
9209,yes.
9210,4 teachers dying in the school (4% out of 80).
9211,15 students dying because of going to school (3% of 600).
9212,80 parents/grandparents/family members dying (4% out of 2000 that the kids in the school will be in contact with after school).
9213,1 death is a tragedy.
9214,"4 teachers, 15 students, 15 family members."
9215,That's a lot of deaths.
9216,"Now, this doesn't mean everyone in a school will get covid."
9217,But the reality is that enclosed spaces mean a lot of infections.

9228,Lol.
9229,Every day we are told by our state Premier to get tested if we have the most minor symptoms.
9230,There are constant TV ads reincorcing the message to go get tested.
9231,There is also financial assistance offered to those who would lose income for having to isolate after being tested.
9232,Everyone I know has been tested at some point and it is expected of us if we have symptoms or have had even casual contact with any other cases.
9233,Honestly it's just a perpetual flood now
9234,Yes a few years of pis turned the country into shithole.
9235,Harsh reality is that the other parties don't have any redeemable qualities.
9236,October.
9237,Coming up to November.
9238,People are still thinking lockdowns alone will solve matters.
9239,Not contact tracing.
9240,Not mass testing.
9241,Not isolation facilities.
9242,"""Just lockdown and everything will be ok.""

It's amazing that even proponents of locking down don't understand the purpose of locking down, that lock downs are only a part of the arsenal, used to buy time to get the other measures places."
9243,Even in October.
9244,How poor is public health messaging in the west?
9245,It's like people in the west seem to blindly copy a single aspect of what successful nations are doing without understanding why the measures are in place.
9246,In October.
9247,9 months after the first lock downs in China.
9248,It'd be funny if it wasn't so pathetically sad.
9249,&gt;This is a complete assumption and not objectively true.
9250,"Excuse me, but it is indeed [objectively true](https://www.aier.org/article/swedens-high-covid-death-rates-among-the-nordics-dry-tinder-and-other-important-factors/) that Sweden has the highest death toll of any nordic country."
9251,Please do not embarrass yourself further by denying this black and white fact.
9252,"The word elimination or eradication has never been mentioned on any North American and European media, and Dr Fauci has said this virus will never be eliminated."
9253,Congratulations on proving them wrong!
9254,MS numbers are SKETCH.
9255,There's a ton of reporting problems with the MSDH.
9256,"They're extremely unreliable, especially with reporting the testing numbers."
9257,"The governor is ""trusting the people to make the right decision"" instead of taking some responsibility and doing the job he was elected to do."
9258,"And, coincidentally, every time cases go up testing goes down."
9259,"Maybe a turdist for months, maybe for life..."
9260,It was responding directly to the substance of your comment.
9261,"I legitimately want to know specifically what and why you dislike about it, because I’m genuinely interested in your thoughts behind what you said."
9262,"Yeah, the majority of the country is still in their first wave."
9263,The Northeast is the exception.
9264,"""picture a..."" Lololol"
9265,It's *a lot* easier to get out of a pool than socially distance / change your lifestyle for months on end.
9266,But I get what you're trying to convey.
9267,I think some schools are still closed here.
9268,I agree that they shouldn't be open yet - they're a major transmission vector.
9269,"The issue is, will enough people take it that it will stop it from spreading further?"
9270,It's not all about self preservation by taking it.
9271,We need a large majority of people to take it to stop it from spreading more.
9272,"SPED jobs are a nightmare remotely, but not one person on my SPED team (8 people) would rather be back in person right now due to the extremely valid health concerns."
9273,Special education teachers/staff obviously have a lot of care for children with disabilities and it breaks our hearts to see children missing out on valuable instruction but we have families of our own to worry about.
9274,They always seem to be lower coming out of the weekend.
9275,I'm curious to see what tomorrow holds.
9276,"I hope it's better than last week, but I wouldn't put money on it"
9277,"I wish the mods on this subreddit would be stricter about people still constantly claiming that ""primary schools are super spreaders"", ""young children are plague rats"" etc."

9287,at least here in the US (in the non-crimson states at any rate) our office jobs have been working from home since mid-late March
9288,"Had a stroke yesterday, writing a detailed account of the experience today."
9289,"What a coincidence, I had a heart attack yesterday and today I'm jogging to all my friends' and family's houses to tell them that I'm ok."
9290,"So...someone like this, you go, ""Hmm...what have you been doing during this pandemic?"""
9291,Then you go to their Instagram page and realize that you've been socializing like normal during this pandemic.
9292,So....not surprised!
9293,Great.
9294,The AP writes articles describing how Americans need to be afraid.
9295,Then writes an article about how Americans are afraid.
9296,The media could approach this a bit differently.
9297,Wuhan and surrounding cities received 40k HCW from the rest of the country.
9298,But that could only happen when you have very few cases elsewhere and that you can lock down a city and says no body goes in and out except with organizers' explicit knowledge and permission.

9323,Respiratory viruses thrive in cold and dry environments.
9324,Transmission is also more efficient in colder drier conditions.
9325,That's probably why AmeriCold was the site of New Zealand's second outbreak.
9326,"Based on [this](https://www.currentresults.com/Weather/New-Zealand/temperature-june.php), on average in the winter (your winter) New Zealand's average temperatures ranges between 7-15 degrees C.

9327,Our winters are [cold](https://www.currentresults.com/Weather/Canada/Cities/temperature-january.php).
9328,Very cold.
9329,Our warmest city is Vancouver and its winter high is the same New Zealand's winter low.
9330,While cities like Edmonton range between -6 and -15 degrees celicus (a full 10-30 degrees colder).
9331,"Despite the snow fall you see, they are extremely dry."
9332,Perfect conditions for respiratory virus to spread.
9333,Right now in October (not even winter) [average afternoon humidity](https://www.currentresults.com/Weather/Canada/Cities/humidity-october.php) is already below 70 percent in large parts of Canada.

9419,We caught it late so required a semi-strict lockdown of three weeks in Auckland to stamp it out.
9420,Became the country's biggest cluster to date and spawned a few sub-clusters.
9421,Wake-up call for the country.

9423,Identified early and didn't spread to anyone else.
9424,* [Quarantined returnee](https://www.rnz.co.nz/news/national/426876/covid-19-second-cluster-has-potential-to-be-very-serious-professor-skegg) who left quarantine after two negative tests and fourteen days in isolation but then tested positive.
9425,"Spread to at least one other person on the flight out of quarantine, and then to their family (who then went on a big holiday visiting a bunch of tourist hotspots)."

9428,Spread to a couple of colleagues.
9429,Still quite early days but again looks like we've aggressively contact traced it into submission and there have been no new cases linked for nearly a week now.
9430,"There have been many other ""scares"" of infected people escaping quarantine or otherwise coming into contact with the community and none has resulted in community transmission."
9431,"What's emerging is pretty solid proof that when you keep cases at a baseline of 0, effective contact tracing can stamp out any new outbreak without the need for new lockdowns."
9432,The virus is obviously fairly infectious but it's not the measles - it can't and doesn't outspread intensive contact tracing when it can't hide among the noise of uncontrolled community spread.
9433,NSW in Australia has proven it too - they had cases popping up for months on end but traced the shit out of them and successfully got cases back to 0 with no lockdown.
9434,Victoria will definitely do the same now that they've done the hard work.
9435,"And then of course you've got all of Southeast Asia, which has been doing this quietly and effectively right from the very beginning."
9436,Baseline of 0 with heavy contact tracing is the only sustainable way to respond to Covid until a vaccine is widely available.
9437,"With such low numbers we can do genomic testing of every single case and identify precisely where they came from, giving us good confidence of whether there are any unknown chains of transmissions out there."
9438,You simply can't do that with hundreds or thousands of daily cases - there's effectively no intevention left to you except various flavours of lockdown.

9447,"This is gonna get so much worse and that's horrifying because, come on, who's having a great time right now as is?"
9448,"&gt; I think things like % infected of the whole population, positivity rate of tests, and fatality rate of Covid are far more useful numbers

Yeah, okay, so [IFR of COVID is sitting around .5-1%](https://www.who.int/news-room/commentaries/detail/estimating-mortality-from-covid-19)

% infected doesnt matter if % death isnt a direct result - and its not."
9449,A large majority of people become infected and do not experience symptoms or issues.
9450,"Positivity rates of tests dont help either as no tests are 100% and even if at 100%, there remains a large % of people who cant or wont get tested."
9451,"So we imagine instead of the positivity rates and fatality rates, we use CFR and IFR - which are both very low."
9452,&gt; Does that mean that it’s safe to drive drunk?
9453,"No, thats a horrible connection."
9454,Its a strawman argument.
9455,"We arent talking about drunk drivers, nor the direct relation."
9456,And even if we *were* - you are comparing wrong numbers.
9457,"Not only do you not know the total amount of drunk drivers (caught *and* uncaught), you also have to take into account how many drivers **total**."
9458,Horrible attempt at a comparison.
9459,"Either way, its a tiny fraction."
9460,Whats the % rate of 225k to 350million?
9461,Thats the CFR.
9462,Now imagine there are at least 50-60% **UNTESTED/ASYMPTOMATIC** people out there - now that number shrinks dramatically.
9463,Using your own 'useful numbers' - what is the % infected of the whole population vs fatality rate?
9464,(Ill give you a hint - its called IFR)

9469,&gt;We're seeing a massive increase in cases DUE TO INTERNATIONAL TRAVEL.
9470,"That's great, your country isn't the one in the post."
9471,Most countries are not seeing massive increases due to international travel.
9472,"&gt;A few people coming from abroad is what has led every country on Earth besides China to having covid within their country,

Yes which is why closing your borders is important when you have low or no cases in your country."
9473,Once you getting tens of thousands everyday closing your borders is far less important.
9474,How do you not get this?
9475,"&gt;it can derail attempts to control community transmission with the country

Not significantly."
9476,If the community is taking proper procedures to screen and isolate positive individuals it shouldn't matter where the case came from so long as they handle it responsibly and prevent it from spreading.
9477,A case coming across the border is no different from a case that didn't.
9478,If you have proper guidelines within that country to isolate and contact trace then somebody coming across the border isn't as great of a concern as what you do with them if thry are positive.
9479,The latter is far more important which has been my entire argument but you cannot comprehend it.
9480,"&gt;As I've said, an untold number of times, both border controls and internal suppression are required to limit the spread of covid."
9481,Yes and in this specific instance the latter is of exponentially greater importance.
9482,"Keeping the border closed isn't even that important if you take the proper measures with any newcomers, like screening them beforehand and having them isolate for two weeks."
9483,"Also with the state many countries are in they are having to focus on the internal suppression, not their borders."
9484,Most countries are not getting their cases from abroad so for them to worry about the border is a waste of time.
9485,"Obviously for countries that are getting covid from abroad it isn't a waste of time, but none of the countries discussed in this post are getting them from abroad."
9486,&gt;Failing to prevent covid-infected people from entering your country will inevitably derail suppression efforts.
9487,Not if your supression efforts include isolating newcomers and screening them beforehand.
9488,"This is why internal policies are so much more important than just ""cLoSe ThE bOrDeR""."
9489,I mean you realize countries are still trading with eachother right?
9490,100% border closure is impossible.
9491,This is another reason having solid plans to mitigate spread within your own community is the highest priority.
9492,"Getting a case from abroad is almost an inevitably, so you need a plan in place to handle cases locally that extend beyond the braindead chants of this thread that are ""close the border""."
9493,Closing the border is like 1% of the fucking job done.
9494,The rest has to be done internally.
9495,"&gt;You're focused on countries that either never got virus transmission under control

AKA the one the fucking post is about?"
9496,Or the majority of them?
9497,"When talking about these countries, which is what the post is about, plans need to include what to do within the country."
9498,A border closure is not what they need right now.
9499,They need stricter guidelines for domestic spreading.
9500,I don't give a rats fucking ass what your prison nation accomplished.
9501,When there is a thread about you guys you can bring up your border closure.
9502,"Unfortunately for the rest of us, closing our borders is the least of our concerns."
9503,I would also like to point out it's significantly easier to maintain a border closure when you're a fucking island.
9504,Try sharing the longest land border with the worst hit country and get back to me.
9505,"&gt;You continue to focus on a particular few countries where border restrictions will have the least amount of impact

**BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT THIS FUCKING POST IS ABOUT YOU TROGLODTYE**

&gt;border restrictions not working in countries with high infection rates

The implication of that statement being they don't work to stop domestic spread, which is the primary goal of any solution these countries are looking for right now."
9506,"Again, I don't give a fuck about Australia, the post isn't about you."
9507,"It's about fucking France, and a border closure wouldn't help them right now at all."
9508,"Shutting things down and bailing people out is a lot cheaper than paying for hundreds of thousands of people hospitalized at a time, many of whom may lose their hones due to not being able to work."

9530,For reference Krystal from thehill youtube channel told that this is third wave.
9531,Kind of.
9532,When you're fitting data you have a curve and you have data points that often have outliers.
9533,"The curve tells you the input response, the outliers tell you how good the fit is but they are otherwise largely ignored."
9534,"If we treat these peaks and troughs as outliers in a curve that is slowly increasing, that tells a much different story from one where the virus has peaked and subsided due to numerous different inputs."

9541,Tests are definitely happening.
9542,"Also, he was scared to get tested after seeing others get it on the news etc."
9543,But was good to see that the testing on kids is less harsh.

9621,It’s terrifying
9622,"Well, don't hospitalize them."
9623,Bing bang boom.
9624,Doesn't Pfizer's have a better t-cell response as well?
9625,seriously.
9626,can't catch covid from fish.
9627,Like I said.
9628,There's way less risk to kids than influenza.
9629,We don't close down schools for that.
9630,It's an entirely different story for older people.
9631,But schools have been open for months with no issues so far.
9632,Life is full of risks.
9633,We take the risk every day for things.
9634,Oh now you guys quote the cdc?

9646,Haven't I?
9647,Yep.
9648,Everyone I know that claims they won't take it are my super progressive anti-trump conspiracy theorists that think the CDC is still trying to help Trump get elected and therefore they can't trust the vaccine.

9952,"If parents had their way, thousands of teachers would be dead now as parents got to sit at home drinking wine working from home with free daycare for their kids."
9953,Smart lockdowns can work.
9954,Innovation with quarantining.
9955,"This is war, we adapted and overcame in all sorts of ways during ww2."
9956,"Human lives matter, rich first world countries have the wealth to save lives for months."
9957,"If we weren't so terrified of leaning on domestic massive companies for money we could go even longer

Imo the message that's not being clearly communicated is yes, we can't lockdown forever, the mental health factor is the biggest issue imo."
9958,"But we CAN lockdown if we know WHY we are doing it, ie, we are stalling for vaccines and treatments."
9959,The message of stalling for vaccines almost seems taboo for governments to talk about and I don't know why.
9960,But that's what we are doing here.
9961,"If people had a common goal when faced with on/off strict quarantining, I think it would be profoundly easier for large populations to stomach."
9962,That goal I think is delaying/surviving for vaccines.
9963,I don’t get it.
9964,How would the two be related?
9965,Does abortion ward off coronavirus?
9966,"I hate to admit it, but I agree."
9967,I know absolutely no one who has died from COVID.
9968,"I've know one person who has OD'd as a result of pandemic stress and two people who have died from not going to the hospital/taking a ""wait and see"" approach to something they normally wouldn't have."
9969,The economic and social impact of social distancing to my family has far negatively outweighed any firsthand covid accounts I have heard.
9970,"I'm still being cautious, but damn am I starting to lose the will to keep it up."
9971,I don't believe you.
9972,Sweden's economy was hit less hard.
9973,I can post a link to back it up.

9976,Plenty are not.
9977,"But they didn't curb it at all, except in their city."
9978,NY was literally the superspreader to the country as residents fled the city.

9982,Have you not followed the news of the recent protestors getting thrown in jail?
9983,"What happened to MLK, Black Panthers, any other person or group of people who criticized the government?"
9984,"What do you think the CIA, FBI, or any other three letter investigates?"
9985,"You do understand that the US Government has a kill list, right?"
9986,"You cause enough noise and they throw the weight of the US federal government towards you, along with the help of the media portraying you as a ""terrorist"" and then kill you."
9987,"You have read the news of the US government sanctioned hit squad running up to that protestor and killing him, right?"
9988,Here's one article that you may want to read https://theintercept.com/2019/10/22/terrorism-fbi-political-dissent/
9989,You think that’s why they banned abortion?
9990,It wasn't masks that elimated the virus in New Zealand.
9991,People are setting themselves up for disappointment if they think wearing a mask alone will get rid of corona.
9992,"TLDR stands for ""too long, didn't read,"" just FYI"
9993,Stupid polish people didn't believe in covid xd and u will pay for that.
9994,U freakin snowflakes.
9995,In Arizona we had a 75% drop and effectively halted our crazy spike a few months ago after all of our cities began instituting mask ordinances.
9996,"Weird, I was under the impression several other countries where abortion was legal also had coronavirus get out of control and overfill their hospitals...must have been a dream."
9997,literally the only people who are eating at restaurants now are selfish assholes.
9998,There is no reason to eat inside a restaurant during a pandemic.

10000,"Yea, that is what he said in CSpan."
10001,We need to reserve medical masks to medical personnel’s.
10002,So he asked government to produce more masks which they never did back in February.
10003,The quote is taken out of context.
10004,"It is effective but since there isn’t enough, we must save it for medical personnels."
10005,"Back then, all masks were sold out."
10006,So asking people to take masks away from people in hospital is not smart.
10007,"So yes, he told people not to wear masks to save it for doctors and nurses."
10008,Happy to see that!
10009,A wave in signal processing is not the same as a wave of a virus.
10010,"Same word, different contexts."
10011,Signal processing is definitely used in epidemiology but in Fauci's context it has nothing to do with signal processing.
10012,The point of contention is mainly political.
10013,"The closest reality is it is either wave two just because the death curve has only had two peaks, and deaths are probably a more accurate depiction of covid due to the imperfections behind testing/asymptomatic cases."
10014,Or it is wave one because any location in the USA has only had one death peak and the two peaks as a country are just a result of one wave moving geographically.
10015,"Denying a new wave or saying that a country is experiencing a new wave is just a political talking point for ""it's not getting worse, we're doing a good job"" or ""it's getting worse, we're doing a bad job""."
10016,"https://theconversation.com/what-makes-a-wave-of-disease-an-epidemiologist-explains-141573

&gt;There’s no strict definition for what is or is not an epidemic wave or phase."
10017,"A wave implies a rising number of sick individuals, a defined peak, and then a decline."
10018,"The word “wave” implies a natural pattern of peaks and valleys; it hints that even during a lull, future outbreaks of disease are possible."
10019,"&gt;let's really, really drop this borderline racist ""Asians are morally superior"" thing."

10021,"Kentucky... so, yeah."
10022,July 10th had 820 cases.
10023,July 24th had 885.
10024,Those were the highest days at that point.
10025,August we had many days in the 2-300 range and even 175 one day.
10026,Sept 17th we had an increase again with 892.
10027,New highest day.
10028,First time over 1k was 9/24 with 1219.

10044,It would be way better to get the numbers low and hold them there with some restrictions then people other than the young and uncaring self centered dolts can go out again.
10045,Can we have f in chat
10046,Can’t have a second wave if you never leave the first ;-)
10047,India has a lot younger average age than western countries.
10048,In the poorest areas there some studies showing they already had widespread infection and therefore maybe have herd immunity now.
10049,There also isn't a culture of putting old people in nursing homes where they can be cross infected.
10050,Most old ppl live with their kids still.
10051,Yeah.
10052,One thing China does well is listen to their scientists.

10055,&gt; The point I’m trying to make here is this is bad and ought to be taken seriously.
10056,Is it though?
10057,"Its causing deaths for sure, but not to the fearmongering total that people are making it out to be."
10058,How many people do you know personally that have suffered a covid death or one of their families?
10059,No one in my circle and only friends of friends.
10060,My direct friends havent either.
10061,"2 of my friends work directly in one of the largest hospitals here in texas, tested positive and still havent had any issues."
10062,"Okay dude, here."
10063,Do you still drive a car knowing that there are drunk drivers on the road?
10064,Im 100% sure you do.
10065,"So theres your answer - if we dont stop driving for drunk drivers, do you stop living your life because of a sickness you cant control either?"
10066,"You can cherry pick numbers all you want, but the only ones that matter are CFR and IFR."
10067,Thats it.
10068,"Hospitalizations dont matter, positivity rates are unreliable as fuck, and other metrics arent paying attention to the ones that really are the true form."
10069,Case Fatality Ratio and Infected Fatality Rate.
10070,Thats it.
10071,Tell me another number that doesnt fall into either of those.
10072,This fake news is beyond sickening already!
10073,Can't wait till the 4th.

10077,Husband tested positive for antibodies in August through the Red Cross (you get a free test when you give blood).
10078,"We donated again in September, antibodies were still there but much lower, so low in fact they couldn’t be sure it was an actual positive."
10079,"He was never sick, no symptoms."
10080,So we have to assume he had it but was asymptomatic.
10081,We can’t even do a backwards timeline to guess when he had it because there were absolutely no signs.
10082,"The last time he was sick was in December 2019, and I thought I read somewhere antibodies could stick around for six months so I guess that’s possible."
10083,Weird thing was that my antibody tests were both negative.
10084,Still doesn’t change what I said

10089,"By spring and summer, people will be eager to get back to their old lives despite the virus being out there."
10090,It’s all about how much risk people are willing to take.
10091,People who have taken all the precautions for over a year will no doubt begin to crack.
10092,"We have to transition back to the old normal eventually, even if the virus is still with us."
10093,"The problem is that a high Ct value can occur in the early or incubating phase of infection, or after an illness, you don't know if viral numbers are increasing or decreasing from a single test/point in time."
10094,"Therefore, as a precaution it's best to assume a person with a high Ct will become infectious."
10095,"It was suggested here in Ireland, that we test twice, a week apart, but we just don't have capacity."
10096,"Instead, if there's a suspect positive with a high Ct the sample is tested again, ideally on a different machine, reducing the risk of a false positive."
10097,"We limit testing twice, a week apart, to close contacts of people ill with COVID-19, however, only half turn up to the second test."
10098,My spouse is a front line worker.

10102,They tell me that they will bring me home doggie bags when they go out on the weekend.
10103,I can accept that.
10104,My point?
10105,Nothing really it is just a funny story.
10106,Rand Paul is [not a real doctor](https://theweek.com/articles/493531/rand-paul-real-doctor).
10107,He is not board certified and never was.
10108,He essentially created his own certification board (unaffiliated with any known accrediting body) so he could certify *himself*.
10109,"Then, a few years afterward, dissolved that body."
10110,This union is trash.
10111,You need to know more about them.
10112,Not all unions are bad but not all unions are good.
10113,Nice
10114,Not an expert on diarrhea I see.
10115,"Easy solution, shut them all down and revoke their business licenses permanently."
10116,There are other mechanisms if the feds wanted to use them.
10117,For example highway speed limits were enforced by the feds at the state level by withholding DOT funds from non-compliant states.
10118,That stood up in the courts.
10119,"Millennial here, this ain't my first rodeo."
10120,right?
10121,I was the unlucky group where I lost most of my income and got the $1200 but never got the 600/month and got just shat on expending basically all my savings.
10122,"1,200 for just a few months would have been life changing."
10123,T-cells don't produce sterilizing immunity.
10124,People with T-cells can still get infected.
10125,"Severity of their illness will likely be lower, but people will still get sick, the virus will still replicate in their body and they can still transmit it."
10126,"I searched for a low-brow Polish medical joke, then I realized even I am (barely) above that."

10129,"And rolled right into it with an ad hominem, and not even a good one at that."
10130,"Yes, some states have sent mail by vote ballots to all registered voters, but in Texas, COVID-19 isn't a valid reason."
10131,"My understanding is that if you are sick, you will need a doctor's note to be able to request to vote by mail."
10132,Don't know if Texas is going to have some special process for those who got sick after the vote by mail request window closed.
10133,"I'm going to guess that those unfortunate folks who are under quarantine just might either be out of luck or will have to break quarantine to be able to vote, either early or on Election Day."
10134,"My county has drive in/by voting, which I guess could be a potentially ""safer"" way for those who are or might think they have been exposed to vote."
10135,The safety level will be determined by the level of PPE that the poll workers have access to and wear.
10136,"I do hope that everyone is able to vote and have their ""voice"" heard."

10138,Sigh....
10139,Cheers!
10140,I don't think a dude that couldn't manilpulate Trump to stop a pandemic should be president.
10141,He'd be walked on politically.
10142,Did Argentina put in contact tracing?
10143,Did they prepare isolation facilities?
10144,Did they build up PPE reserves?
10145,Did they implement mass testing?
10146,"If the answer to the above is no, then no wonder locking down alone didn't work."
10147,"Lock downs are not a magic solution, just like masks alone aren't."
10148,Haha.
10149,Good stuff.
10150,Thanks.
10151,They just shut down one study where where they gave the drug to hospitalized patients...there are still other studies of the drug with patients in an earlier stage that continue.
10152,I sort of wonder why they gave it to hospitalized patients to begin with.
10153,I thought it was pretty well established the later stages of Covid are characterized by a cytokine storm... basically an overactive immune response.
10154,"Giving the Lilly drug, which is supposed to boost your immune system even more, seems counter-intuitive."
10155,I hope your numbers stay low but they won’t.
10156,They’ll climb again then people will realize that we have to live with this virus while trying to balance life/economy...
10157,"no shit, to start something 2nd time the 1st time has to be over."
10158,when was it ever over 1st time
10159,As an American in Australia it's amazing to me how I hear that many of these restrictions are followed by the honor system in Victoria.
10160,It's so hard for me to see that happen in the US.
10161,So far I feel the government has come across very trustworthy here and that's partly why I think people respect them more.

10197,Their dual antibody approach performed better.

10207,Cheers!
10208,That's be my guess...
10209,I figure we just ought to crack down on large gatherings and mandate masks in public.
10210,Let's just get this over with lol.
10211,How many people who are out protesting are dying?
10212,"Not that I'm turning this into a right or wrong, Left vs Right, Republican vs Democrat thing, but if this virus was really that dangerous as you claim, then why is protesting allowed?"
10213,"I'm not talking about the rioting and the Police force when reacting, I'm talking about the actual peaceful protests."
10214,Why is that allowed?
10215,"If the virus is so dangerous and spreads like wildfire, why is protesting allowed at all?"
10216,"Do BL really M, or is that just a thing we say?"
10217,"If they mattered we would stop and prevent ""large gatherings"" right?"
10218,"I am not so heartless to say that the 200k+ people that died is an acceptable loss, but what I have an issue with is that less than 3% that have contracted the virus actually died worldwide, yet we encourage and allow protests and then blame certain people in the white house that the virus is not under control."
10219,The Governor's who allow their states and city's to host such large gatherings that some call riots and some call peaceful protests are the same states that are also dealing with increased numbers in cases.
10220,California for example.
10221,"LA showed shots of protests with major streets being flooded with a sea of people protesting, and currently have or accumulatively have not, not sure which, 914,000 cases and now the Governor of California is trying to tell its people that they can't gather for the holidays."
10222,"Why is it that the government has no problem with protests, but turkey dinner with the family is not?"
10223,One last thing I urge you to consider.
10224,"If this virus was actually as severe as we are being led to believe, then why are we not hearing more about the extermination of the homeless population."
10225,Wouldn't they be the absolute first to be effected by this virus?
10226,Since when did we as a collective nation decide that protesting in the streets is more important than working and supporting our families?
10227,"At least we have enough to bail out Wall Street, too bad about all those citizens and stuff"
10228,This is the biggest upward redistribution of wealth in American history.
10229,The robbery which ended in the 2008 implosion was like knocking over a kid's lemonade stand compared to the economic rearrangement that's happened in the last 11 months.
10230,How many months has he been saying this?
10231,Life is dangerous.
10232,Nobody gets out alive.
10233,Sigh
10234,The thing with test and trace is that it protects against the known.
10235,A/presymptomatic transmission requires mitigation in conditions of uncertainty.
10236,This is why masks are so important (and why the Taiwanese put them on in large numbers straight away).
10237,I don't think you can really say that one is more important than the other as their purposes are different.
10238,"We don't have good experimental evidence, no, but we do have epidemiological evidence."
10239,To be fair if you turn off the news after Election Day......kind of like if only we’d stop testing so much
10240,lol you were the one to mention the flu vaccine in the first place.
10241,"the name of the game isn't ""get the one with the best immune response"" it is ""find the one that works the best"" that's not always the same."
10242,we'll see pretty quickly which ones of the vaccines work and which ones don't in actually preventing the virus or at least making it less severe for those who get it.
10243,also luckily we have multiple countries at play in the discussion many of which are currently having out breaks so it may even be more quickly that we see X number of cases among participants so they can write up the efficacy
10244,"You can make it up, that’s literally what they do."
10245,"If you disregard reality, science and plain logic you need to fill that void with something else, conspiracy theories are it."
10246,The topic of whether children (especially young children) are a major vector has been hot since February.
10247,"One of early studies: https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.17.20053157v1.full.pdf (which found no infections until age 10 despite significant exposure in city of Vo)

It IS absolutely clear that Covid19 affects children in a very different way than it affects adults: the disease is much lighter and less common in children (that's a major difference with cold &amp; flu) so it's not unreasonable to expect that the carriers are less infectious."
10248,"&gt; bamlanivimab 

who picks these names?"
10249,It's the difference between closing book stores and grocery stores though.
10250,Both have the same level of risk for customers and employees.
10251,But only one is essential for life.
10252,"In OP's example, only one of those is ""essential"" (those low paid ""essential"" workers do need to actually *get* to work) whereas literally no one is going to die if they can't go to church for a bit."
10253,Especially now that technology makes virtual services easy.
10254,"So while his uncle is *technically* correct, he's still a complete dumbass because he doesn't seem to understand why certain businesses were allowed to stay open."
10255,"Or he's just so out of touch that he thinks the bus riders can ""just get a car""."
10256,you not read polish ?
10257,amateur
10258,"So far all the kids in my little nook seem to be okay, I haven't actually seen a bus pick up or drop off for a weekish."
10259,So there might be a chance Huxley stopped in person classes.
10260,"Then again, I could just be missing it."
10261,It's the shamelessly self-righteous moralizing that I can't fucking stand.
10262,"If people want to turn a blind eye to the suffering of other human beings, so be it; nothing new there."
10263,But the balls that some people on this sub have to viciously assault the moral character of *anyone and everyone* who disagrees with them whilst supporting [policies that are literally causing children to starve to death](https://www.unicef.org/press-releases/unicef-additional-67-million-children-under-5-could-suffer-wasting-year-due-covid-19) is just fucking unbelievable.
10264,History will not judge them kindly.
10265,It IS the point.
10266,You are a narcissist and what are you doing to prove I'm wrong.
10267,Where in any of this am I wrong in my comments?
10268,You lack any commentary that suggests otherwise?

10270,The timing is certainly suspicious.
10271,"At the very least, they probably figured doing this in the middle of a pandemic wouldn't get thousands of people to the streets."
10272,"Gf works in Pharmacy, and hoo boy."
10273,The virus and the vaccine
10274,People were apparently chained or welded into their homes in some areas.
10275,Elsewhere there were soldiers guarding city blocks and you needed a pass to leave and buy groceries.
10276,"If there’s a zombie apocalypse next, let’s hope it starts in China because they have the best chance of containing it."
10277,"Hmm, covid-19 is listed as an example of an airborne pathogen on Wikipedia"
10278,Jim Lahey is that you?
10279,Looking forward to 0 cases across all of  Australia!
10280,I still haven't received my $1200 stimulus check.
10281,"&gt; It’s funny how people get so defensive

For 6 months there's been ""skeptics"" posting the same message about other countries that have got on top of things and seemingly a lot of disbelief that it's possible."
10282,"Once bars open for standing room, revs will surely be open for a week straight... Or we should just block off chapel, Swan and Brunswick St and have a big ol Street party"
10283,"Even if some say it's because of low testing, which is true but how come even the deaths are low."
10284,This is either the end of first wave or India has passed through the herd immunity.
10285,We will know in a few months I guess.
10286,"But I'm hopeful for it to be over, and cautious for it to not return."
10287,"Not to the same extent, no."
10288,"They tested paper, cardboard, money bills, glas, plastic, copper, stainless steel, wood, ect.."
10289,"So there's at least a pizza box, the package of fruits and meat, and the water bottle."

10293,The choice is hurt the economy or let people die and also hurt the economy even worse.
10294,Yeah I was holding my breath till the end of reading this analogy
10295,[removed]
10296,Get your logic out of here
10297,"The curfew stuff confuses me, it's not like the virus is more spreadable in the dark."
10298,It doesn’t need to be 100% to achieve herd immunity.
10299,Do you live in a bubble or all alone in the wilderness?
10300,Avoiding humanity totally is the only way to eliminate all risk of the flu.
10301,Most people would benefit from a flu shot.
10302,"Depending on the year, which types of strains are prevalent and how well they predicted the strains, it can reduce your chances of catching the flu by 40-60%."
10303,"And if you do catch it, it’s less likely to be severe."
10304,"“It’s just the flu” can very easily mean a truly miserable ten days or time in the hospital or severe complications like sinusitis, bronchitis, pneumonia, and heart problems."
10305,I’d happily get a yearly shot for any reduction of that risk.
10306,My mom actually broke a rib coughing from flu induced pneumonia.
10307,She was only 50 at the time.
10308,"Between that and feeling like I’d been struck and buried by a truck full of flaming asphalt for two weeks when I had the flu in my twenties, I get a shot every year."
10309,"Managed to avoid getting it for the past twenty years, yay."
10310,Hope I continue that streak this year.
10311,Jesus.
10312,How many times I see this.
10313,You don't have to socially isolate.
10314,I consider myself an introvert.
10315,"But I still spent a lot of time outdoors with friends and family, had a cookouts outdoors, visited people at the beach and park."
10316,"Had a visit or two from family members, kept our distance and wore masks."
10317,Anyone who thinks you need to avoid everyone all the time is kidding themselves.
10318,"No you can't pile into a night club and grind on girls all night, you can't mosh shoulder to shoulder at a concert, you can't smoke weed with your buddies while playing FIFA (all these are examples of people on this subreddit, freaking out why life sucks btw) but 90% of what you did before you could still do in most places."
10319,"Mine too, also in Ohio."
10320,every day I get into my car I drive by restaurants that have outdoor covered seating.
10321,"It's not safe to be indoors, so they let people eat outside on the patio."
10322,"But then with the weather getting colder, they have giant tents to help with the rain and cold."
10323,Which is the same as being inside.
10324,This winter is going to be rough
10325,I hate that argument the most and I've heard it a lot since I recovered.
10326,"Sure, you won't die, but here's a potential lifetime of shit side effects that we know nothing about yet!"
10327,"...but you know, muh freedoms to not wear a mask and all."
10328,He reminds me of George Burns
10329,"To be fair, the students don’t work *with* the COVID patients."
10330,I should’ve clarified that.
10331,"(Rough day, sometimes I type too fast and miss key points.)"
10332,"Big floor, multiple wings, one of which used to be the COVID wing but now at least one other wing is full."
10333,"However, even though we don’t work with them, we talk to the nurses who do, we are well aware of how many there are, we walk past their (closed-door) rooms (in our PPE) at times, and we see how fast our floor is filling up and displacing the regular med-surg patients elsewhere."
10334,ETA: That adds fuel to their fire.
10335,"I don’t work with these patients or see their charts so how do I know they REALLY have COVID, blah blah blah."
10336,Right?
10337,Like I honestly wanted to know the things they disliked lol.
10338,If I dislike something I can explain why.
10339,My pint is it seems worse now.
10340,We have new high counts.
10341,You can actually see a new wave starting.
10342,So I don’t get the semantics at this point.
10343,"First, third, whatever man...."
10344,Wtf are you talking about?
10345,They're decaying.
10346,Do you understand what that means?
10347,They are proteins; they break down and cease to exist.
10348,Get this anti scientific garbage out of here.
10349,"Yep, one way chloramines are generated are by [chlorine reacting with ammonia from sweat or urine](https://chlorine.americanchemistry.com/Science-Center/Chlorine-Compound-of-the-Month-Library/Chloramines-Understanding-Pool-Smell/)."
10350,I'm not for or against him.
10351,I listen to facts on covid.
10352,I'm shocked by how many people can't stand him.
10353,Who would have thought it was good for the economy to not have a raging epidemic.
10354,in the middle of july they promised the vaccine by august 15th....
10355,The horrifying thing about 2020 is that it revealed how dysfunctional the US government and its political class were.
10356,"I didn't have a high opinion of them before, but I still assumed that non-partisan entities like the CDC would still be able to function."
10357,"After all, the US dealt with Ebola and SARS pretty well, and the swine flu wasn't this disruptive either."
10358,But my impression now is that the US government is so incompetent now that they can't even hide their incompetence.
10359,"It's brutally clear that not only do they have no idea how to solve the crisis, there's a criminally negligent, if not malicious, attitude that many of them have towards their own citizens."
10360,"Now the USA hasn't been the only grossly incompetent government during this crisis (we've seen plenty this year), but damn - how the former superpower has fallen"
10361,"I'm told: If you have one being ventilated, it takes all the staff to care for that one."
10362,Poland went brrrr real hard
10363,I think we are in overlapping waves like being in a stormy weather in the ocean where waves are all coming from every direction.
10364,I appreciate the summary points.
10365,The rules are very tilted just by the very nature of excluding schools districts IMO.
10366,"In the Denver area alone more than 250,000 students attend K-12 on a daily basis according to enrollment numbers and estimates say roughly 20% of students are remote."
10367,"So even at that 200K people gather, mingle, and head back home to parents, siblings, and grandparents."
10368,Seems like a bit of a Grand Canyon to gloss over for the state.
10369,Might be safe to bet there are significantly more infections points in the schools alone than every single business put together.
10370,Oh you know who she thinks the “right person” is
10371,"&gt; No, but they do tend to have pretty compliant populations."
10372,Their government tells them to do something and they generally do it.
10373,"Koreans, Thais, and Hong Kongers would disagree"
10374,What difference does the number of wave make?
10375,!
10376,I've never seen someone (them not you) deflect so hard from a simple question asking for information
10377,I think they are definitely making that point.
10378,I was saying that the last few paragraphs were generally gloomy in tone compared to the rest.

10383,"Dude, calm down and read what I said."
10384,"We did lock down, I said as much."
10385,"That lock down helped us eliminate the virus, which is why we are **no longer under lockdown**."
10386,"And my original comment was that you don't have to lock down **for 12 months**, not that you don't have to lock down at all."
10387,Bars make people sloppy and potentially more lax.
10388,Although I hate to say any small businesses should close.
10389,If only we could allow them to temporarily close but financially support that closure.
10390,"Of course, that is the ideal solution across the board, but obviously complicated."
10391,Its all so complicated.
10392,But I appreciate the discussion had here today.
10393,Edit: I mean close as a trade off.
10394,I am getting sleepy and not thinking clearly at this point lol
10395,But accomplishes the least.
10396,"They're likely not spreaders, and, at least the elderly, don't have as many potential years ahead of them."
10397,Innoculating them most likely doesn't stop the spread as rapidly.
10398,Isn't the *greater* good what we're after here?
10399,But if you put the UK government in New Zealand they'd be screwed.
10400,Same.
10401,"California’s case count is going up, not down."
10402,"Even under this scenario, normalcy is still more than six months away."

10411,Everyone has it.
10412,"T cell immunity applies to all viral infections in humans, not just SARS COV2."
10413,The human body has a typical  t cell response to coronavirus just like every other virus that challenges the body.
10414,There's nothing special about this virus save that it is novel.
10415,"Why is it crazy, just one random guy collapses on the street, he could have had heart attack, stroke,  or could have just simply fainted."
10416,like it hasn't happened else where in the world.
10417,Picture a swimming pool filled with people.
10418,"In some lanes of the pool there are more or less people with explosive diarrhea, but they're all part of the same US Olympics-sized swimming pool."
10419,This is the most underrated comment or Reddit today
10420,Lol that's a very immature comment.
10421,"There is a world outside of America, and 95% of those countries have failed to do the simple thing that you think could be done to stop it."
10422,"Many of them have destroyed their own economies and imposed awful restrictions on daily life in an attempt to do what you describe as the ""simple thing"" that could stop this all."
10423,Turns out it's not so simple.
10424,[removed]
10425,So did you lockdown or not because you’ve now claimed both.
10426,We both know you locked down so quit pretending to be butt hurt for being called out about it.
10427,YES!
10428,Any time I made this point I got downvoted into oblivion.
10429,"If we did our job at the beginning, we wouldn't be in the situation we are now."
10430,"3-4 weeks of lockdown early on without whining about the economy or masks as a political statement, we would have been back to semi-normal."
10431,People just don't care though.
10432,I calculated the numbers for Germany.
10433,We are 5 weeks away from Poland and 7 weeks away counting in the number of beds that supposedly can be turned into ICU.

10437,They're not disappearing.

10439,&gt;where temperature checks would have actually made a big difference.
10440,Exactly.
10441,Temp checks are just security theatre when dealing with COVID.
10442,An asymptomatic carrier won't have a fever but can sure as hell spread it around.
10443,I... thats part of what makes the issue so complex
10444,I think their max was 6th?
10445,Just before it really hit S America.
10446,These people could have been wearing a mask and doing what they were supposed to and got sick from some 'loser' who wasnt.

-America"
10448,"We can whine all we want about the US, but at the end of the day relying on 365million people in an incredibly divided country to socially distanced and wear masks was never going to to work."
10449,It was never a sustainable strategy.
10450,"And also the EU is experiencing huge surges just like us, so again, it not a US problem."
10451,Is it true trump signed and executive order to be able to fire Fauci?
10452,Or did I read fake news?
10453,Pray to your mamon!
10454,I think you'd need to send some vehicles ...
10455,"OH, A STUPID CHINESE WHO LIVING IN WEST ILLUSION."
10456,Well shit.
10457,"Same here in usa, basically."
10458,What difference does it make?
10459,"It went down but not to zero, then it went up again."
10460,That's a wave that hasn't hit the ground.
10461,"But hey, if he wants to call it the first wave then that's fine too."
10462,The end result is the exact same.
10463,USA has much Lower average population density.
10464,Let's hope Virginia Tech comes up with some fancy experiments there.

10466,"The dose makes the poison, imagine handling contaminated packages each day, btw Amazon had 20k infected workers since march, that's that."
10467,I think it depends which group is smaller.
10468,I'd assume that the elderly and immunocompromised count as a smaller group than everyone else so I think it's best to vaccinate them first.
10469,"Boy that escalated quickly haha... dropping F-bombs, so much for Canadian politeness."
10470,It was condescending to say that the people of your town are smarter than people in cities.
10471,"If you took off your rose-coloured glasses, you would see that there are ignorant people in small towns in Canada."
10472,"https://youtu.be/Fgr_zNGbvIs

10473,"When asked to wear one, he refused and assaulted several people inside."
10474,"Upon leaving, he got in his vehicle and tore through the parking lot, doing damage to the outside of the store, before speeding off."
10475,Provincial police pursued him and fatally shot him at his residence.

10479,"Within 100 km of US-Canadian border, there are more cases on the Canadian side than the American side."
10480,Time to get off your high horse and realize that there is a shared culture between the two countries.
10481,There are ignorant folks all over North America.
10482,I can see highschoolers being more of an issue for these types of behaviors.
10483,But I can also understand that teenagers are at the age where they are immature and rebellious yet they crave social interaction.
10484,Its so tough for them.
10485,That is a whole other issue that needs thoughtful consideration.
10486,Because are they adhering to guidelines even during lockdowns?

10503,"It’s just smaller, so the seats are less inclined, and we go see movies near the end of their run at this location."
10504,"There were some other patrons wearing onesies giggling before the movie started, kinda cute but annoying ten minutes in."
10505,"After the opening credits they started going in and out very frequently, more than once per five minutes."
10506,"Really killed the vibe, but then they started using the emergency exit, and propping it open."
10507,"My wife tells me she’s had enough, and so we go to leave, and the manager bumps into us, *hands us 4 passes for free movies* here, these people suck, set off the fire alarm twice already.” As we were leaving the police were pulling up."

10515,"This explains it more eloquently than I ever could (the talk of approving the EUA was prior to the FDA meeting early last week):

&gt; In all likelihood, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) or other regulators will issue the first COVID-19 vaccine approval or emergency use authorization (EUA) for one vaccine while many other candidates have clinical trials still underway or in the planning."
10516,"At that point, ongoing studies of any vaccine—including that first one—could become unethical because half the participants would get a placebo, at a time a vaccine with established efficacy will be available."
10517,"“It’s a very vexing issue,” says Christine Grady, who heads the bioethics department at the National Institutes of Health (NIH) Clinical Center, which organized a “grand rounds” webinar on the challenges last week."
10518,"&gt;  For all these questions, Grady tells ScienceInsider, the ethical equation “boils down to a fairly simple calculus”: the individual versus the societal value."
10519,"During the webinar, philosopher Joseph Millum framed the issue as “fundamental” to all clinical research."
10520,"“Clinical research is ethically challenging because it exposes participants to risks for the benefit of others, not for the benefit of participants themselves,” said Millum, who works with Grady at the NIH Clinical Center."
10521,All I'm saying is that there is a portion of the FDA advisory council that is not as keen as others to push for an EUA.
10522,It might not happen.
10523,Having that information isn't a bad thing and I never said they should or shouldn't get an EUA.

10557,"Haven’t been within 6 feet of anyone except my husband, the person who gave me a covid test (my husband had an emergency that we thought could have exposed him), and the person who collected my drop-off ballot."
10558,So frustrating.
10559,longest TL;DR ever .
10560,lol.
10561,but nice you found ctrl+a ctrl+c and ctrl+v.
10562,:D
10563,"By idiots who,didn’t know what they were talking about."
10564,"I mean, our PM and federal government would never have had the first nationwide lockdown if it was up to them, so he compares in that way- but when the states forced them, they came to the party with money to support people who couldn’t work."
10565,"So yeah, not like trump"
10566,I’ll wait for that to happen
10567,Why are cases still rising in Canada?
10568,I thought masks were mandatory there?
10569,"Here in the U.S where I live, I'd say more than half refuse to wear a mask."
10570,Or they're just too fucking lazy.
10571,I'm beyond angry.
10572,So you're saying 99.6% is not the survival rate?
10573,You're saying that the global lock down for a virus that is less dangerous than the flu is justified?
10574,I seriously hope you're joking....lmao.
10575,I guess you're scared of monsters in your closet as well.
10576,"I believe THIS is the study they are refering for that bit:


""Multi-organ impairment in low-risk individuals with long COVID""    
https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.10.14.20212555v1
  


&gt;Interpretation: In a young, low-risk population with ongoing symptoms, almost 70% of individuals have impairment in one or more organs four months after initial symptoms of SARS-CoV-2 infection."
10577,There are implications not only for burden of long COVID but also public health approaches which have assumed low risk in young people with no comorbidities.
10578,"Hell, I'm still waiting on over 20 weeks of PUA unemployment."
10579,I'll hopefully be gainfully employed by the time it finally goes through.
10580,You can't train to be a critical care doctor or nurse in 7 months.
10581,"Yeah, actually just found that myself."
10582,"SCMP really sucks at citations, I'll look at this now."
10583,Judging by how much you are on here I highly doubt you will go out of your way to do something unless there is attention or karma involved.
10584,Sorry bud.
10585,These articles are stupid and make covid like this bad ass virus that can kill everyone.
10586,People don't realize that young people dying to covid could have possibly had an undiagnosed issue prior to covid.
10587,Obviously those deaths would be investigated and looked into more than others.
10588,"This graph doesn't indicate older people are getting infected, just that all communities with older people are increasing Infections overall."
10589,"Technically, it could still be all younger people."
10590,he just says sensational stuff to make it into the headlines it's blatantly obvious at this point
10591,&gt; but authoritarian government and people who actually listen to their government is effective in this kind of situation.
10592,"Well, if people still can't get rid of this ideological context, it can be predicted that you will never be able to control the virus."
10593,"&gt;...Across the world, doctors have noticed that Covid is often accompanied not just by the familiar shortness of breath and coughing that affect the body, but also by a huge range of conditions hitting the brain – from foggy thinking, through delirium, all the way to strokes and Parkinsonism."
10594,"&gt;So serious was this in Britain that, as the pandemic took hold early this year, doctors set up a monthly committee to coordinate reports of brain disorders."
10595,Neurologist Dr Hadi Manji was among them.
10596,"Very quickly, he says: “We had to make the meeting weekly because of the numbers of referrals.”

&gt;Indeed, new research from Chicago reports that one third of Covid patients hospitalised early in the pandemic suffered some form of altered mental state – from confusion to unresponsiveness."
10597,That in itself is not so unusual.
10598,Being seriously ill affects lucidity.
10599,"According to Mary Ni Lochlainn, fellow in Geriatric Medicine at King’s College London, up to 80 per cent of those in intensive care suffer delirium."
10600,"But the consequences with Covid, the Chicago statistics suggest, are dramatic."
10601,Those with brain disorders needed three times as long in hospital as those without and were seven times more likely to die.
10602,On discharge only a third could perform routine tasks.
10603,yep... in Alberta they have billions and billions and tax cuts to the oil and gas industry as they were leaving the province.
10604,"this week one of the folk woth billions is a being purchased.....

and it's only the oil and gas sector that got money."
10605,"&gt;Personal Services may operate at 25% of the posted occupancy limit, not to exceed 25 people, per room."
10606,"What they'll do is block off 75% of the seating at most places, meaning you end up with the same density."
10607,"&gt;Restaurants may operate at 25% of the posted occupancy limit indoors not to exceed 50 people excluding staff, whichever is less, per room."
10608,See above.
10609,&gt;Houses of worship and Life Rites may operate at 25% or 50 people.
10610,"For outdoor worship services, a house of worship must maintain 6 feet distance between non-household members

Ditto."
10611,Outdoor services with social distancing is where it's at.
10612,"&gt;Indoor events may operate at 50 percent capacity or 25 people, whichever is fewer."
10613,There shouldn't be any indoor events at all.
10614,This is a pandemic.
10615,"&gt;Gyms, recreation centers and indoor pools are not authorized to open for in-person services; virtual services may be provided."
10616,Good.
10617,Buy a Peloton.
10618,"&gt;Outdoor recreational activities in groups of 10 people or fewer may occur, maintaining 6 feet Distancing Requirements between
non-household contacts."
10619,"Again, this is a pandemic."
10620,"Lane County, Oregon here."
10621,"Not seeing a problem with any of this (other than what your business owners will do in response, that is)."
10622,[removed]
10623,I didn't intend to tell you that freezing is 4°C.
10624,Just only wanted to say that the virus is viable for several weeks at low temperatures.
10625,"No, it implies the same places have been hit twice."
10626,"The peaks of the first wave correspond to different areas of the country seeing massive numbers of cases (Northeast, South, now Midwest)."
10627,"What he's saying isn't just ""semantics"" as some other people on here are implying."
10628,He's saying these places that have been hit haven't seen the second wave yet.
10629,NYC for example could see a larger worse version of what they saw in the spring.
10630,"This is apparently the study they refer to:

10631,There are implications not only for burden of long COVID but also public health approaches which have assumed low risk in young people with no comorbidities.
10632,Cant have a second wave if you’re still in your first wave.
10633,Big brain move on America.
10634,"Right, because it wasn't my intention."
10635,Lol
10636,"Dr Fauci, is a massive fearmongerer and tries to make headlines with every sentence he says."
10637,He should change that.
10638,Yes!
10639,"And this time we need to do what scientists and epidemiologists said to do last lock down that Trump completely bungled and didn't even try to accomplish: ramp up testing, set up a robust contact tracing program, and don't open up until 2 weeks of declining cases."
10640,"Then we need to be able to test randomly, and targeted testing as well."
10641,We need to be able to stamp out small fires.
10642,Right now it's still an inferno.
10643,This is the one time a Federal response makes complete sense.
10644,People move from state to state and interact with other communities.
10645,"Some states don't have the budget that other states have, yet the richer states can infect people in poorer states."
10646,This is the time we need one leader and one plan to get everyone on the same page.
10647,Can’t have a second wave if we never leave the first.
10648,Problem solved.

It's about a five minute watch

From the transcript

&gt;This virus has demonstrated no seasonal pattern as such so far."
10691,What it has clearly demonstrated is if you take the pressure off the virus the virus bounces back.
10692,"&gt;  
&gt;That's the reality, that's the fact."
10693,"You can call that a second wave, you can call that a second spike, you can call that a flare-up; you can call it anything you like."
10694,Take the pressure off this virus; the virus will bounce back and that's what we will say to countries in Europe; keep the pressure on the virus.

10725,I'm one of those.
10726,"I got all kinds of bullshit answers like ""epidemiology isn't mathematics-based"" and ""it's the first wave until we hit zero""."

10728,That made me wonder why he chose that number.
10729,"We did get down to 30,000, which is the same order of magnitude, although close to the next if you are doing percent of the total population."

10829,"2nd this, people aren’t going to care once the vaccines out and people are taking it.... but can you blame them?"
10830,"We would’ve spend at least a year away from other people by that point, the goal has always been to get a vaccine out and to vaccinate people."
10831,"If it’s changed people are going to as you said, revolt and go in the compete opposite direction."

10833,I truly don't understand you vaccine doubters anymore.
10834,There are multiple major companies spread across several countries that all expect their candidate vaccine to be done by the end of this year or the beginning of next.
10835,"How is that even remotely a ""wild card"", any moreso than testing or treatment improvements which have been advancing at a similar or slower rate this whole time?"
10836,"Well, you know, him and his girlfriend."
10837,I guess I could have been more specific.
10838,"These spikes are just because of when data is being reported, not really when cases are increasing/decreasing."
10839,It is just because most places are not reporting data on a day to day basis.

10844,So there's that.
10845,We deploy hundreds of millions of flu vaccines every year.
10846,I'm surprised it's going to take months to distribute.

Indeed very interesting numbers, I believe that not cancelling surgeries, cancer screenings, and still letting people go to the doctor might have an influence on these numbers."
10891,Your gut feeling doesn't matter.
10892,Fact remains that there is very little science pointing toward children being a main driver in this pandemic.
10893,"For all the ""just listen to the science"" in this sub, this is a topic where anecdotal evidence apparently is more important."
10894,Why do you keep such stupid friends?

10905,I feel violated.
10906,Autocracies are more effective in times of crisis
10907,Clearly not.

10909,"In terms of being locked down with no source of income, there's really no difference between the two."
10910,Well duh America.
10911,You had the most amount of time and chose to do this.
10912,That's the crazy bit.
10913,Wear a mask.
10914,Wash your fucking hands.
10915,Social distance.
10916,Avoid groups and the numbers will come down.
10917,It's only a matter of time before a vacation is available.

10920,I wonder what the link is?
10921,Seeing you lower the bar from 50 000 000 to 3 000 pretty quickly is quite interesting.
10922,That's statistically significant in fact.
10923,Oh of course it can happen and will happen again.
10924,"It's perfectly preventable though, don't travel when sick and wear masks."

* if it’s negative, you either got the covid vaccine and it didn’t work, or you got the placebo

You can’t tell for sure whether you were in the test or the control group from an antibody test result."
10934,The clinical trial people would be interested in any antibody test result too.
10935,Also - it is not yet proven to scientific standards that the immune response is an *effective* immune response.
10936,Positive antibodies does not necessarily mean immune.
10937,"That is the point of phase III trials, to show whether or not the vaccine actually beats the disease - we know it works against fragments of the virus in lab conditions but it’s a big step from that  to say it actually stops covid."
10938,"If your parents are vulnerable you should continue to stay away, as hard as that is."

10942,Anti-HBs from Hep B vaccine has a half life of 9 months.
10943,It's usually considered effective for 10 years.
10944,"After that humoral immunity is mostly gone, but cellular immunity persists."
10945,"Some CDCs recommend revaccination at that point, while some deem cellular response strong enough."
10946,"If occupational exposure is a risk, booster is usually recommended."
10947,And it should be mentioned that the rate of decline usually depends on initial response (2X or even more).
10948,"So a strong response not only lead to a higher initial Ab titer, but it could also decrease slower."

10962,Guess they victory lap they took last month was too early.
10963,"This is the problem, lock downs need to be met with financial welfare to those they’ve forced out of income."
10964,The term wave is made up.
10965,Viruses are like wildfires and spread to new areas/people.
10966,"If you look at the 1918 flu by geographic location, the places it crushed early didn’t really have large second spikes (philly) because everyone got it."
10967,The places that put in restrictions/had time to prepare had opening/closing waves.
10968,"The later did do better since the rate of transmission became lower (possibly treatments  became better), but to some point a virus will burned and got who it got."
10969,History is repeating itself.
10970,The places who got burned (NY in particular) aren’t having massive second death spikes.
10971,Meanwhile this is re-emerging in Europe and continuing to move around the US.
10972,Fatality rates are lower than March due to treatment knowledge.
10973,"So in a population approaching herd immunity, what has the death rate been?"
10974,That would be an interesting statistic..
10975,[removed]
10976,Suicides haven't risen year on year.
10977,It'll be really fascinating to see if one vaccine performs far better than the others.
10978,"For example, if Pfizer elicits CD4+ but Oxford is better with B cells."

10990,Pisses me off.
10991,You’re assuming that the most important issue to the American people this election is COVID.
10992,"Plenty of people are more concerned by the economy, police violence, racism, abortion, healthcare, guns, etc."
10993,That's great.
10994,But it doesn't change the fact that it happened and can happen again.
10995,Things aren't all that clear.
10996,The 2 regions most affected by the first wave were the Paris area and the north east.
10997,"Paris is badly affected again by the second wave, and while the north east isn't doing as bad as some other areas, the situation is still deteriorating there and they now have a curfew in several départements."
10998,[removed]
10999,17% oof....
11000,"but it is now true, US is in the third wave, it's called a wave because of how it looks on a diagram, if it peaks then goes down then goes up and peaks again etc each of those is called a wave, there's no special scientific definition."
11001,I saw this comment like three hours ago and I'm still giggling.
11002,XD
11003,"The last one was a ""study"" by United Airlines and the US Dept of Defense."
11004,"Obviously, both sources are tainted."
11005,Something like 95% of vaccines fail phase 3 anyways.
11006,More news like this is on the way soon unfortunately.

11028,They barely did anything and the numbers are bad compared to NZ.
11029,Why not mention some true success stories such as Vietnam instead?
11030,Lumping Japan together with NZ is doing NZ a disservice.
11031,Florida is doing a lot better.
11032,Masks everywhere.
11033,"Tbf, Fauci has said he expects “some form of normalcy” in Q4 2020."
11034,He’s either lying or he means an adjusted normal- there’s no other way of shaking it.
11035,"To be honest, in the past even slightly harsher flu season could overwhelm our hospitals."
11036,And those idiots in government decided that they don't need to use summer to come up with a coherent plan.
11037,I asked this too the other day and got downvoted into oblivion.
11038,Apparently the hive mind doesn’t understand how pandemics work.
11039,"The health of others is a by-product of the precautions, the main thrust of which are to remain virus free."
11040,Are you high?
11041,This is the worst idea
11042,Melbournian here.
11043,It was tough.
11044,Still is.
11045,"I'm glad you're fortunate enough that it was a work from home trivia holiday, but for 400,000 people in Victoria that lost their jobs, it was a lot harder."
11046,I've been off work since March 25th when international borders closed.
11047,"My savings and emergency fund has run out, and I'm now borrowing money from friends to pay bills."
11048,"I'm hopeful my work can go back soon, but working for international airlines makes it not very concrete."
11049,"I can't afford to service my car, I can't afford to buy new clothes now that I've put on a little bit of weight, and I've been on and off antidepressants and suicidal the entire year."
11050,"I haven't eaten anything other than pasta and rice recently, and some nights I make myself toast or a sandwich to save money."
11051,"I also moved out this year, and live more than 5km from my friends and family."
11052,"I live within 5km of three people I know, and two of them are not very nice people, and the other is my housemate."
11053,"So for the past 3.5 months, I haven't seen any family or friends in person until last week."
11054,"I would do it again, and I do think it was the best course of action, but dismissing it as not too bad is a really disrespectful and privileged position to take."
11055,Those of us that work in jobs that either can't be transferred to home or just aren't needed in a lockdown environment have really suffered.
11056,Not to mention the small businesses.
11057,You’d be surprised by how many people need to eat something frequently because of health reasons though
11058,"I have friends that absolutely genuinely think that a vaccine is a ploy to track them, somehow involving Bill Gates."
11059,"I can't believe people genuinely buy into this shit, let alone people I know."
11060,"Then I want to say, ""you can't be too fucking worried about being tracked anyways, you carry a cellphone and update your facebook religiously - you literally give them any info they want, they don't need to put a fucking chip in you"" but that probably wasn't the best response."
11061,"&gt; In France, the places that were the most hit by the first wave are now the places that are the less hit by the second."
11062,Given that Paris and the greater Paris region were and are being hit hard in both waves I find that difficult to believe.
11063,"You know, there are priorities."
11064,And Covid isn't the worst thing in the world that can happen to you.
11065,The state has some big problems if Alabama has to lead the way.
11066,"Yeah, it takes some courage to step out in that."
11067,It's what I would imagine acting on stage would be like for the first time.
11068,I got a lot of stares and some laughter when I was sporting a half face respirator.
11069,I might start using it again as cases increase.
11070,I've been using N95 at all times where a mask is mandated or prudent.
11071,"But as the percentage of population infected starts to climb, N95 leaves that 5% gap which is caught by P100 HEPA filtering of the half-face respirator."
11072,"If this pandemic has taught me anything, it's that public health people are really, really bad at their jobs."
11073,8 months later and we still haven't managed to communicate how risk management works.
11074,Natural herd immunity is talked about by politicians and the public as if it's a thing that has literally any chance of ever happening despite it being effectively unheard of in human history and a simple SEIR model shows that any reasonable virus parameters for covid never reaches herd immunity.
11075,We still have a huge fixation on hand washing and surface cleaning when that doesn't appear to be a major spread vector.
11076,The CDC only recently begrudgingly admitted the obvious truth that covid is at least partially an aerosol spreading disease despite that being clear for months now.
11077,Seemingly every day I see a headline about still being in the first wave as if that is a thing that remotely matters.
11078,I have yet to see any media article that gives a remotely realistic timeline for vaccine approval and deployment.
11079,Probably more but I think the point is clear regardless.
11080,Typically around 3 days and 6 days after I land.
11081,The false negatives can be quite high any earlier than that.
11082,I'll also quarantine until I get results.
11083,Thankfully labs have been pretty fast
11084,I would hope we would have a full on storming of the bastille moment but in the end it would probably just be rednecks kidnapping governors.
11085,Exactly this.
11086,"It is not even second wave, this is just people not caring anymore."
11087,A store just opened in my local area in Sweden and there were around 600 people in there.
11088,"No one cared, no guards, nada."
11089,aw cmon!
11090,"I worked maybe 10 days during the first lockdown in NZ, driving a fairly long distance through a large city."
11091,I didn't get pulled over once - I don't think I even saw a cop.
11092,It was mostly honour system unless you were blatant.
11093,"Tread carefully, though: in the USA, dozens of people have been shot over the question ""Mask or no Mask"" and at least three governors have been threatened with detailed plans of abduction in case of a mask mandate."
11094,In Germany it's mostly non-lethal violence and a couple of days ago the main building of the Robert-Koch-Institut (roughly comparable as our version of the Center for Disease Control) has been attacked with Molotov Cocktails.
11095,Airborne isn’t a binary yes/no.
11096,"There’s airborne like measles (will fill a room and land on every surface), and there’s airborne like Covid (12-15 feet), and there’s airborne like what they originally though covid was like (3-6 feet)."

11348,"Of the subjects tested, 100% exhibited **serum neutralizing activity** against the 1918 virus (mean titer 1:562), and 94% had serologic reactivity to the 1918 HA (as indicated by hemagglutination inhibition assay (HAI) titers of 1:40 or greater; mean titer 1:396), even though these samples were obtained nearly 90 years after the pandemic."
11349,"Source: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2848880/

&gt; That doesn't mean you lost the ability to fight the virus should you encounter that strain again."
11350,Vaccine-induced immunity tend to generate a weaker immune response.
11351,"Inactivated virus vaccine may not elicit T cell memory, and B cell is the only defense recruited."

* Victoria as a state was isolated from the rest of Australia."
11388,* Melbourne as a city was isolated from the rest of Victoria.

11764,"Shameful government, they passed that abortion ruling which was in the making for years and now people are protesting."
11765,It's appalling that they couldn't see these protests coming and this could've waited.
11766,Now cases will spike further and PiS will blame the protests for this when this is all their doing.

11807,That's about it.
11808,Still didn't make them give a shit.
11809,"I think the figures are about right for PCR (70% sounds a bit low), though it depends on the test strategy."
11810,If you are testing at random in an area with lots of infectious people then you will indeed get quite a few false negatives (due to testing someone who only got the virus a few hours ago).
11811,"But if you are testing as a result of a specific contact with an infectious person, then you can wait 24 hours before testing and the false-negative rate will be a lot less."
11812,And if you are concentrating on people with relevant symptoms the false-negative rate will be a lot less.
11813,"But it's important to realise that the 2% (or 1%, as I have seen in some reports) is a fraction of total tests."
11814,"It means that if you are getting a 5% positivity rate, then 40% of your positive results are false."
11815,And that is significant.
11816,Wtf is wrong with you?
11817,Go crawl back into your cesspool.
11818,I'm definitely a big fan of vaccines but is it wrong of me to be nervous for the first one?
11819,Like I don't want to be the first wave of getting that vaccine cause I'm scared of side effects.

11825,"At this point, enough time has passed since the 2nd dose of these vaccines in phase III trials and we haven't heard of any worrying patterns of major adverse effects - so I'd wager to say that yes they're safe."

11834,"&gt; two people who have died from not going to the hospital/taking a ""wait and see"" approach to something they normally wouldn't have."
11835,What did they die of?
11836,Was it just ignoring a slight pain that didn’t go away for a few weeks or were they on their deathbed refusing to go to the hospital because covid?
11837,[These are also good](https://www.3mcanada.ca/3M/en_CA/worker-health-safety-ca/respiratory-protection/reusable-respirators/) with P95/P100 filters (make sure not to get the gas/vapor only ones because they don't do shit for Covid).
11838,But you have to cover the valve with a mask/piece of cloth (to protect others) and disinfect them after use (to protect yourself).
11839,But if you get on a plane you probably want to protect your eyes too so goggles or a faceshield in addition to a P100/P95/N95/KF94/KN95 mask/respirator would also help.
11840,"Would love to see them report back as to how many of these cases turn serious or into deaths

Edit: oh wait thats right they won't, they just want you to think all of these people are going to die from coronavirus."
11841,Pathetic.
11842,Helps being a service based economy able to isolate from the rest of the world
11843,Yeah exactly.

  - alter DNA transcription/translation
  - alter cell signaling

11866,And I expected a similarly evasive and indignant response when your arguments don't stack up to scrutiny.
11867,You can't know if contact tracing is working unless you're testing to track infections.
11868,Durr.
11869,"And any country that is *actively discouraging* testing is certainly not an example of great ""leadership."""

11995,Then there are the long term effects of a case.

12007,"I already owned a cloth mask that I bought in Vietnam to deal with air pollution, and it took less than two weeks to get in the habit of wearing my mask on the daily."

12025,N95s at all times (no exceptions/food/drinks/whatever unless it's a medical emergency) + filtration should significantly reduce the risk.

12035,The mask is just one tool.
12036,"It helps a lot but without the other pieces, eventually, masks won't help much either."
12037,The masks reduce infections to and from people.
12038,It limits how quickly infections take place.
12039,Testing tells us who is infected.
12040,Tracing tells us the connections of people who are infected.
12041,Quarantine gives us the ability to separate infected and their connections from non-infected.

12057,In Sweden it’s claimed that government does not interfere in the work of Folkhälsomyndigheten at all.
12058,Because that would be unscientific populism just like in... all other countries.
12059,It’s also been widely claimed that economical considerations has played no part att all in the strategy.
12060,But now one of the most central members of government appear to clearly state that “all the time” it’s been “most important” to find measures that “balancing between infection control and economy”.
12061,"This must mean that either:

\- Governement does indeed interfere in the work of FoHM to ensure the proposed measures does not cost society too much."
12062,"or: 

\- Government are acting outside of the strategy and recommendations of FoHM when they fx raise the number of participants in events."

12073,Maybe in some tourist country where it is 45c they might end work sooner because it's too hot to pick berries or make roofs or whatever but here pretty much it is year round normal work.
12074,This organization has some serious credability in the medical community.
12075,This is what I am worried about when it comes to Covid.
12076,What are the long term implications?
12077,"As a result, it is worth to note the Chinese system is in constant reform, and is probably the political system that has changed the most among its peers the past few decades (Deng XiaoPing market reform in the 80', Jiang opening of the party in the 90', etc.)."
12078,"There is no point in treating it like the China of Mao, this isn't a dictatorship ruled by a family like the Kim dynasty in North Korea."
12079,"Because some of my other political long explanation posts have been removed from this sub on basis of being ""purely political"" (which is fair), I'll end up with some thought about all this reflects to the present day coronavirus situation:

The Chinese system is way more *accountable* than the American democratic system."
12080,There is no way a singly party state can shift the blame to the opposition.
12081,They have to fix whatever difficulty happens because they don't have any choice to keep their legitimacy intact.
12082,"In contrast, I'd argue democratic systems allow any elected official to pretty much do whatever they want once elected, just with the ""threat"" of not being reelected in a few years, but it literally doesn't even matter if the leader at that time took deliberate and disastrous action, or completely mismanaged a critical situation, in foreign policy or domestically such as not handling a deadly pandemic resulting in hundreds of thousand of death."
12083,"Moreover, because of their competency, it is the coronavirus task force that handled the crisis in China."
12084,"[Dr. Zhong Nanshan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zhong_Nanshan) ran the show and called the shots, and was on TV while XI Jinping was criticized in the Western media for not being present, while it was basically his job to let the expert do theirs:

&gt; In early January 2020, Zhong visited Wuhan, in response to a growing cluster of then-unidentified pneumonia cases, and was reassured by city health officials that the disease was controllable and preventable."
12085,"On January 20, however, he returned to Wuhan, to re-evaluate the situation, and came to the conclusion that the novel coronavirus was more transmissible than previously identified, and warned the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party[10] that authorities in Wuhan were likely understating the severity of the outbreak, and on the same day, publicly announced on state television the same."
12086,"This isn't specifically a characteristic of the Chinese system per se, as many democracies more or less let their task force direct the action, but the technocrat side of Chinese leaders (f.e."
12087,Xi JingPing has an engineering degree) and respect of science certainly had a strong influence.
12088,"Overall, the democratic vs authoritarian system isn't as a clear cut as you might initially believe, and while I certainly acknowledge you can't talk freely about overthrowing the CPC in China, criticizing policies is possible, protesting is possible (see article above), and better, the Chinese have more freedom in the sense they can get their government to act for the better in a more practical way."
12089,"I won't argue the Chinese system is perfect and all rose tainted (China faces enormous challenges), but if I'm to look at the data and past results of policies, depending on your definition of ""freedom"" I personally might prefer the Chinese system than the American one, and certainly prefer it for the freedom of living a life 

Lastly, while I did some research and have my opinion on HK and XinJiang, I don't want to dive into these topics since they very politically heavy and clearly not in line with this coronavirus sub."
12090,Hopefully the above is acceptable and doesn't get removed.
12091,&gt; Curious.
12092,How would you argue that exactly?
12093,"Not Chinese, but China has been my pet peeve for a few years and I have dived into how it basically works more than the average Westerner."
12094,"I wouldn't exactly say China is more ""free"" in the liberal sense of the term, but I would certainly argue their system is much more ""reactive"" to the need of their citizens."
12095,"To make it short, I like these two sentences that quite reflects the reality imho:

* *""In China, the government controls the corporations, while in the US corporations control the government."
12096,"""*

* *""You can't change the party in China, but you can change the policies."
12097,"You can change the party in the US, but you can't change the policies""."
12098,"*

To support the first point, having election isn't a guarantee that policies will widely reflects the wishes of the people."
12099,See f.e.
12100,"[this study by Princeton University (2014)](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/perspectives-on-politics/article/testing-theories-of-american-politics-elites-interest-groups-and-average-citizens/62327F513959D0A304D4893B382B992B):

&gt; Multivariate analysis indicates that economic elites and organized groups representing business interests have substantial independent impacts on U.S. government policy, while average citizens and mass-based interest groups have little or no independent influence

Which basically means the US democracy is little more than an illusion, and that while in theory the system should reflects a ""one man, one vote"" principle in the polls, in practice Jeff Bezos vote (of a different kind of paper and outside of the poll) weights much more than the one of the average American."
12101,"For the second point, one need to realize that while the Chinese don't choose their leaders directly, China [has elections](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elections_in_China) on a local level, and they have a different mechanism to select competent officials on the higher levels, pretty much based on results and performance, rather than voting the most charismatic leader."
12102,"Not having direct elections on the upper levels also doesn't mean they don't have legitimacy (elections equaling legitimacy being more of a Western amalgamation), and it doesn't mean their isn't any other channel in place to voice their needs, notably in the form of public opinion surveys."
12103,"For a more academic and longer article about that topic, there is this excellent writing: [The ""Surprise"" of Authoritarian Resilience in China](https://americanaffairsjournal.org/2018/02/surprise-authoritarian-resilience-china/) by Wenfang Tang (2018)."
12104,"That one article is particularly interesting since it goes deeper in the public survey system, and demonstrates the reasons the Chinese people actually support their government in mass (higher than in most democracies), and that the various Western explanations for this high approval (such as ""Chinese live in an unfree society so that they have extremely low expectations about what their government can do for them"") are actually unfounded, and that the judgment of the Chinese system by the West is certainly ideologically biased."
12105,"(As a side bonus, reading this you might learn a few interesting things about the Tiananmen event that might defy your original understanding)."

12111,"Kids over the age of 10-18 are much stronger vectors for spreading the disease, which is pretty evident since most of the outbreaks in schools both in the U.S. and internationally have been in high schools."
12112,This is not a one size fits all solution.

12152,Ever since I've read about the Spanish flu  I remember it being referred to as having come in waves.
12153,It's not a new idea and it just means there's a dip and spike in statistics.
12154,There is no scientific definition based on the stage the viruses in or something like that.
12155,It's not a reference to the genetic stability or the emergence of a new strain.
12156,The virus does not need to mutate at all for a second wave.
12157,Sooo...
12158,It's really just opinion or simply a way to reference any type of data that forms a kind of significantly oscillating pattern.

12249,I’ll guess even the scientific community knows yet why this is.
12250,But I’m sure it’s not just masks.
12251,Will this one turn us British?
12252,Thanks for sharing!
12253,I just started wearing one at work and other people started to.
12254,Now it’s like sixty percent and the shit talkers have mostly shut up.
12255,For a turd mentality

12263,Czechia: Those are rookie numbers.
12264,My husband and I have a bet going as to when they close school again.
12265,I won't be at all surprised if it happens this week.
12266,Corrected 78%
12267,Because having antibodies is a factor in not becoming reinfected quite often and not having any generally means a tougher time fighting off an infection.
12268,"They are also probably concerned that if one can not fight it off a second time, those who think they are immune might be the next wave of super spreaders."
12269,I think looking at something that has killed hindered of thousands of people with an abundance of caution is probably a good thing.
12270,Are you worried we are doing too much to stop the spread of this?
12271,"Yep, mask usage is near 100% here in my part of Ireland and all bars and restaurants have been closed for over a month but we still ended up back in lockdown this week"
12272,Why would it be a joke??
12273,The fascist need to be stopped
12274,Ah thank you.
12275,"Do you know how they define ""asymptomatic""?"
12276,I am not an epidemiologist to be so sure.
12277,"But, I am at least interpolating patterns observed across Europe and US."
12278,"Primarily, winter is going to be a key reason for the spread."
12279,"Luckily, Canada is huge and the population is low so it takes time to show up in the numbers."
12280,The sad part is people realize the problem only after it occurs.
12281,Cities like Toronto and Vancouver should gear up soon.
12282,Definitely even harder the second time round because people will of had enough and I can’t see the financial support getting handed out to businesses for another extended period of time if they are forced to close again.
12283,Think most of Europe and the US are just holding onto hope that a vaccine starts getting administered before the end of the year....and that it is fairly highly effective !
12284,Zero cases is unrealistic now but lockdown in the UK was originally set to be 3 weeks and it went on for months to make a proper difference in case rates so any reasonably effective lockdown would need to happen for the same amount of time again...
12285,"They were doing pretty well until the end of July, then it really started to spread and they seem to be averaging about 80 cases a day for the last few weeks (down from 200 a day but still not very good at all)."
12286,"Which for a population of only 1.4 million, it means there's significant community spread, especially as almost all of it is on Oahu, where the population is geographically spread along the shore lengthways with only a few main transport routes, which should make it even easier to contain than in populations where it's just one big metropolitan blob."
12287,"Yet, they've had five times more deaths in that area than in Australia."
12288,Just seems like we should be able to do this effectively in 2020.

12314,"I'd argue that the way the public school system is organized sometimes hampers social development, as the real world has developed in ways that the rigid hierarchy of schools can't reflect."
12315,"What about students who have now been able to avoid bullying, harassment and physical and emotional abuse now that they don't have to go to school in person?"
12316,"If the role of a school is to be a child abuse detection center, we have much more serious problems as a society."

12325,"Ok, thanks a lot for the explanation!"
12326,I'm super-pro mask and agree with the sentiment of the article.
12327,"That said, I also found this ""study"" to be suspect."
12328,There is a lot of room in the interpretation of the results.
12329,Trying to diagnose anti-social personality disorder based on the results of a few questions on a survey reeks of confirmation bias and armchair psychology.
12330,"&amp;#x200B;

Unfortunately, there is plenty of piss-poor methodology and confusion between correlation/causation in many of the studies I've seen in the past 10 years."
12331,"Furthermore, the click-bait titles and amateur interpretation done by untrained writers of these articles doesn't help either."
12332,Am I going insane?

12334,"Wow, thanks for such a detailed answer."
12335,"It reminds me a lot about the training my dad told me about getting, although he was police and not military."
12336,"Basically they were told that people who couldn't be saved (category 3 I guess, especially those with radiation sickness in a nuclear exchange) would be euthanized by police who were all going to be given guns (which on its own would be a big deal here in England)."
12337,"In guess for Denmark you were expecting an attack from the sea, invading Copenhagen or something?"
12338,school will shut down for 12 days (31okt-11 nov).
12339,I think that will slow down the spread and maybe even get exponential shrinking (R&lt;1)
12340,Biden didn't say what part he/his legal team thinks it would violate.

12389,It is visibly clear here people dying of anything other than covid doesn't matter
12390,But what if we could?
12391,🤔
12392,"I think the problem here isn't so much the personality, but that the wrong message was send in the beginning."
12393,"Once we got over the initial ""don't wear a mask"" the message was generally ""masks are for protecting others"", little to no focus on mask as tool for personal protection."
12394,"If you don't care about others, that's all the more reason to keep your distance and mask up."
12395,That's unreal.
12396,I would expect leader of ISIS say that…but why scientists?
12397,"I mean I can understand doubt towards lawyers or pharmaceutical companies, or the defense industrial complex, but scientists in general?"
12398,"I’m speaking strictly about the United States, which hasn’t been able to contain the virus and decided to open schools without much of a plan or PPE funding, which led to outbreaks."

12401,one village has 6k/100k currently infected.
12402,Butchenbach has 339cases /5629 pop
12403,Tbh getting mass downvoted for saying reinfection still is not a huge issue yet or saying we could be close to normal in spring or saying long term effects are probably much rarer than we think and we can learn from the flu how to cure them is really perplexing

12405,"Both can be bad, no?"
12406,"What infuriates me about many people is the way they arbitrarily pick and choose which ""experts"" count based on whether it fits their agenda or not."
12407,The information in this article is... incredibly weird and cherry picky looking.
12408,Kind of suspicious.
12409,"There are a lot of sources mentioned but always vaguely and it seems like a great deal of them have crippling errors including but not limited to: citing anecdotal evidence with no references, citing studies that concluded less than a month before schools in the areas reopened which obviously wouldn't be enough time for major outbreaks, citing studies from reopenings in Asian countries which have 1000s of times less cases than places like the US and as such aren't really comparable..."
12410,Fake news.
12411,Where are people getting infected?
12412,From the US: The Los Angeles County Health Department was able to trace only 65 to 70% of all positive cases.
12413,"Of those, the majority, 55%, are from gathering/events (unknown if it was indoor / outdoor)."
12414,"In second place, 17%, places of worship."
12415,"Then 6% childcare, 4% schools, 3% colleges, and considering that education is mostly online in LA, this is not a tiny number."
12416,Another 15% were unspecified.
12417,"http://publichealth.lacounty.gov/phcommon/public/media/mediapubhpdetail.cfm?prid=2760


Note: this describe where people think they got infected, not nessecarily where they really got infected."
12418,"Still, it seems like that schools are still significant sources of infection according to those numbers."
12419,"Ok, but I never used that shitty sub."
12420,&gt;I believe it’s 65% protection for the wearer.
12421,Not insignificant.
12422,"Only if you have an n95 masks, dont re-use, and dont touch it."
12423,Most people dont use masks correctly.
12424,They may as well not even have one on.

12436,"For the last time, antibodies aren’t the only way to get immunity"
12437,Oof
12438,How is this different?
12439,&gt;Two new studies demonstrate how severity of disease is predictive of longer-lasting antibody production and detail how immunity wanes over time but may exist for up to 7 months.

12447,How?
12448,"&gt;in simple words, people who dont want to wear a mask are assh*les

Nobody *wants* to wear masks, do they?"
12449,So lots of people will think it.
12450,Be better than this.
12451,"Your first point is really valid, but along with other points made in this thread, really just highlights other problems with our country, not with schools."
12452,Why isn't there a push to expand internet access to more citizens?
12453,Why isn't there a push to increase food security?
12454,To work on reducing domestic abuse rates?
12455,Why are the same people who have worked on reducing funding and dismantling public schools now extolling the role of those same schools in solving these societal problems?
12456,Because it's a convenient scapegoat to avoid having to confront the problems themselves.
12457,"As a high school teacher, I don't give a shit about students over the age of ten that aren't responsible enough to do their schoolwork without Mommy and Daddy looking over their shoulder."

12488,"&gt; If immunity only lasted a couple months we would’ve seen a shit ton of re-infections, which we haven’t."

12491,"We're in like, month 8-10."
12492,"If immunity lasted for a couple months, with the number of people being infected, we'd be seeing a HUGE number re-infected."
12493,"Right now we have one or two possible examples, which says immunity definitely happens for at least 8 months."
12494,And those are from people who actually got tested.
12495,"Kids don't usually get tested unless they have symptoms, and they are often asymptomatic."
12496,I wonder what % of cases are the parents getting sick from their asymptomatic child who brought it back from school or playtime.
12497,"Maybe that's some of the ""unknown"" percentage."
12498,"The mayor of Atlanta and her husband got sick that way, 2 of their children were asymptomatic."
12499,"Many people go to the hospital or doctor with Covid and the doctors tell them to assume everyone in their family household has it, and to quarantine everyone."

12525,"China runs phase 1 and 2 in China, because those trials are mainly concerned with safety."
12526,In fact I believe there's a new influenza-based vector vaccine in trial right now in China.
12527,They can't run phase 3 in China because there are too few cases of COVID-19 in China to determine how effective a candidate is at preventing infection.
12528,"Those trials are very public, with application forms on weibo and everything."
12529,Back when Ad5-nCoV phase 1 trial was running (the first one to enter phase 1 in China) the volunteers would even do vlogs from inside their quarantine to describe how they're feeling and what's for lunch and so on.

12552,"Now, the populist government is using the “schools are a right card” as if that solved the problem of a pandemic and is coherent with closing everything else."
12553,"And yes, school is a right, but it’s not the only right, there cannot be a pecking order for the sake of argument only."
12554,So businesses see themselves sacrificed on the altar of incompetence.
12555,Nothing was done to keep the vulnerable protected either.
12556,There’s a surge of cases in nursing homes and within families with young children.
12557,The government is promoting restrictions without disclosing the scientific rational to the public.
12558,The Italian government does not have a clear plan nor has it thought of one in the past six months.
12559,"You can restrict and lockdown all you want, mandate masks and hand sanitizers."
12560,"That’s not enough to stop the pandemic if there’s no plan, it just makes you go through boom and bust cycles rather than a flatter curve."
12561,"So I can’t really fault the people of Lumbardy, Italy and many other countries for not sitting down again without demanding clear answers and a clear plan."
12562,I edited the post.
12563,"Basically, yes."
12564,That's my hypothesis as well.
12565,"Though I will say that people have unfortunately started relaxing with the social distancing recently, and our curve shows that."
12566,Combine that with no internet and you get ww3
12567,[removed]
12568,Significant?
12569,They are not even in the parliament
12570,"Sometimes it is good to know when a phase, or a spike, or a wave, started."
12571,"Since that would allow you to figure out what happened and make sure it won't happen again, for covid as well as any future diseases."
12572,But that is if the government care about it in the first placd
12573,That makes too much sense they’ll have some multi-tiered system that’s different for towns within the same city’s that makes no sense like we have here in the UK.
12574,Money&gt;People is clearly the way we’re going over here.
12575,Reckon it would take a solid 6 months military grade lockdown to get cases down now in lots of places in Europe now it’s so out of hand !
12576,[removed]
12577,Are you retarded?
12578,"You have to be dumb as a rock to buy in to low effort, pseudo-scientific propaganda like this."
12579,Masks either have supporting evidence or they don't.
12580,Bullshit psychological assertions doesn't change that either way.
12581,Republicans: \*waves hand\* There is no Covid.
12582,There should be a law against analogies this good
12583,Which disorder?
12584,"NPD, ODD, BPD, Psychopathy, Sociopathy?"
12585,"Really puts a new perspective on ""we are number 1"""
12586,No.
12587,The USA averages between 30k-60k flu deaths per year.
12588,That's 0.009-0.017% of the population.
12589,What is national freedom?
12590,We have three territories (internal)...
12591,It would be a dream.
12592,"Most of the work sectors have been abandoned without any help, some people have not yet received the money that the government gave in March."
12593,People is tired.
12594,"I live near Naples where there was a revolt, but the whole Italy is in danger of dying of hunger instead of of Covid."
12595,"The government had a few months between the first and second wave, but no one did anything."
12596,"The places of hospitalization and intensive care have increased slightly, many structures have been built but never tested and above all there is a lack of doctors, nurses and anesthetists."
12597,"Activities such as catering, but also taxi drivers and many others, have spent THEIR money to buy masks, plexiglass panels and to make the premises compliant with the spacing etc."
12598,The result?
12599,The government makes them close first.
12600,Italy is tired and if the government continues to give a damn about poor people it will end in the worst way
12601,Is it known as being a cunt ?
12602,Hmm interesting.
12603,What do you think it is then?
12604,Do people practice social distancing in Sweden?
12605,"Wow, this came as a surprise to me as I would have assumed Hawaii would remain pretty safe."
12606,Apparently they have had 14k total cases.
12607,For comparison's sake Australia has 27k total.
12608,What are they doing on Hawaii??
12609,?
12610,"Camping &amp; grounding 12 million of the population is, in fact, extremely costly &amp; annoy."
12611,"Consider the infrastructure(wall &amp; building), supervision, manpower cost, plus the everyday supply and the cost of a managing system, there is literarily no cost-effectiveness."
12612,"You would say ""The forced labors""."
12613,"But 12million people without being selected by the market, with different education levels, including kids and elders, cut down the normal connection to the outside(also means they are not part of the consumer in the market - needs leads produce, ECO 101 )."
12614,"this kind of ""concentration camp + force labor"" things are really dubious when you pour some thinking into it."
12615,"Sounds like what I’m doing anyway to be fair, work - run -sleep -repeat."
12616,Unfortunately everyone else here in the UK has decided to give up.
12617,Would probably take 6 months solid lockdown to get our cases to zero now.
12618,Not that we ever even had a real lockdown to begin with !
12619,"Don’t even know why people here are going out, with all the new rules it’s just not the same, being bored at home is honestly better than going out now 🤷‍♂️"
12620,"&gt;it's not an rDNA-based vaccine so it's easier to get across the ""it's a conspiracy to alter human DNA"" crowd :) 

Bold of you to assume that crowd won't just make shit up"
12621,Don’t forget the people who could stay out of the shit if they wanted to buy decided swimming was more important to them.
12622,Should be forced to take the vaccine at gun point
12623,How do you differentiate between a spike and a wave?
12624,We were almost at zero new infections in Ireland a few months ago and now we're up around 1k per day
12625,Actually saw an article about the more layers to the mask the better not sure pf the credibility.
12626,T-cells are one example.
12627,The body has different types of memory cells that allow for the rapid identification of a payhogen and the rapid production of antibodies in the case of a re-infection.
12628,My ex gf has borderline personality disorder and she bitched about it all the time...so anecdotally....yes
12629,How scary.
12630,I voted by dropping off my ballot.
12631,We have a mask mandate but still dont feel comfortable going out in a line.
12632,&gt;Why are cases still rising in Canada?
12633,I thought masks were mandatory there?
12634,"Well, masks aren't the end all be all OF avoiding COVID-19."
12635,Despite what some people believe.
12636,Here in Sweden you need to actively search to find anybody with a mask.
12637,Yet we still have had very few new cases during the late summer up until recently.
12638,Mask usage (or lack of it) is not what drives the pandemic.
12639,Exactly.
12640,Hence me mentioning my mom and the internet
12641,Disrespecting sociopaths.
12642,And our government just... loosened quarantine rules so if you had contact with someone infected all the people in your house that you might have infected are free to roam about.
12643,:/ The rules were fucked up before that too - the quarantine was only for 10 days so of you infected someone in your house it was likely they would sti be infectious when the quarantine ends.
12644,And if you had symptoms after those 10 days of quarantine you were also free to go.
12645,Honest question.
12646,Can we here in Canada expect to see a rise in the second wave like that of France and the rest of Europe?
12647,60% of the time Fauci is right every time.
12648,"They were speaking personally, obviously it doesn’t kill everyone, but for those of us with certain health conditions... well, it’s not a risk I’m going to take."
12649,[removed]
12650,"In case of Covid, as it seems to be an inflammation problem mostly, sometimes with the antibodies matching and attacking body tissue."
12651,"Also, Covid is very fast in replicating, 0 to max."
12652,viral load in one or two days.
12653,"Yeah bro, it's just a flu, go party with your friends, please."
12654,"And don't wear a mask, ok?"
12655,"One meat missile can only kill a few people at most, one spreader could be responsible for many dead."
12656,"Yeah I know im Swedish :)

I tried doublecheck the numbers myself but ended up with a similar (but different) result."
12657,Have you seen it discussed somewhere on reddit?
12658,"I assume lots of people already wrote them, including media."
12659,So i dont think its nice of me to write them aswell.
12660,Usa is so FUNNY
12661,Is this not just the US election
12662,There was a drop of almost 97% in Flu cases last season.
12663,Which is incredible.
12664,"Unless there was any indication that the surge in Belgium was driven by a significant amount of reinfections, I don't think this holds."
12665,"Most people in Belgium weren't infected in the first wave and it's one of the most conducive places in the world for fast spread for a wide variety of reasons, which if uncontrolled is going to dwarf any buffer from the people who did catch it the first time around."
12666,"They have about half of the deaths per capita as New York, most of the population is still potentially vulnerable."
12667,"Look up cold chain logistics, and you have your answer."
12668,"Where are this informations from, esp."
12669,"the part ""And coronaviruses use the trick of not raising long-term immunity ""."
12670,The death rate is actually under 2%
12671,"A virus is a force of nature, like the flu."
12672,"As an American, I can tell you, with the entire world's wealth and resources, we have not managed to stop the flu; but you are sitting there demanding China be able to stop a brand new virus that no one has ever seen before or even knew about."
12673,That's really quite unreasonable and unrealistic.
12674,"Well, they did stop it."
12675,It took them a few months but they did it.
12676,I extrapolated on my point.
12677,Nice diversion tactic.
12678,"To be honest, I don't really care *why* people do the right thing, as long as they do."
12679,"While there are undeniable downsides to conformity, it tends to get things done, and it's often pretty straightforward: you're flat out told what you should do, and then social pressure takes care of the fact that you also do."
12680,"In general, I think good governance only needs two things:

* good rulers that can figure out what should be done
* population that does what they're told to do."
12681,"Around here, power is divided and held by bureaucrats and economic interests, and it is difficult to control the public opinion and decide on factors of importance."
12682,"Facts themselves are often used for political fodder, to control potential voters and consumers, and thus they are twisted and turned until truth is all but obscured."
12683,People will lock themselves in homes out of their own volition - out of fear - before any of that happens.
12684,They're in the wave pool i think!
12685,"I agree that there are two strategies, suppression and control."
12686,"The first can be put in place only with a strong lockdown first (until the test and tracking system catches everyone) and then putting a ban on all the international movements (or quarantining everyone), ban which isn't to be lifted until the end of the pandemic."
12687,"The second would mean only putting in place those measures strictly necessary to prevent hospitals from being overrun, easing and reinforcing them according to the epidemiological situation."
12688,"Poorly timed over confidence, and it's just not a Denver or Colorado problem, we're seeing it globally and it's why europe is getting hit so hard right now, everybody seems to have forgotten there's a global pandemic at the second most critical point of containing it."
12689,I find it interesting media always puts a photo of the most whitest kids
12690,"Whatever wave the U.S. in, it looks like the situation is at a pretty critical juncture."
12691,"Hospitalizations and cases per day are moving past their previous peaks in the earlier in the year, and so the question is how much higher they can go."
12692,"Does the virus have a sort of hard-limit on how quickly it can spread now, or does it blow past the previous peaks and make for a real catastrophe?"
12693,I’m not sure but we’re gonna find out.
12694,And here’s one thing I suspect is true that goes against a lot of conventional wisdom.
12695,"It’s been suggested asymptomatic cases are a huge portion, meaning a lot more of the population has been exposed than the numbers show, but I think asymptomatic spreaders are actually not that common."
12696,Which isn’t to say they aren’t the virus’s trump card.
12697,They are.
12698,"They make it almost impossible to contain, but there aren’t so many of them that we can feel assured we’re a ways along with this"
12699,&gt;I think that the most scary real-world sign that immunity doesnt last is that Belgium (second reported deaths after Peru) for example was one of the worst hit countries during the spring.
12700,And now the cases are though the roof again.
12701,Why?
12702,A high estimate for the number of infections in the spring in the UK was 1/8 of the population.
12703,That leaves 7/8 of the population vulnerable even at the high end.
12704,"So far about 3% of the population has tested positive, and even if we allow for under-testing, there is nothing that argues against some form of immunity over time based on those numbers alone."
12705,"Sure, it's possible, but these numbers neither help nor hinder the argument for long-term immunity."
12706,More like a fingerminigun.
12707,Antrim Area hospital is already overloaded and NI currently has more covid patients in hospital than at our peak in April.
12708,Plenty of regional variation within the UK.
12709,"It is from ""Statistikmyndigheten"" which could be translated to something like usa.gov/statistics."
12710,"Like we have the same thing in my country [https://www.dst.dk/da/](https://www.dst.dk/da/), this is like a website keeping track of everything in the country from domestic abuse to unemployment."
12711,"You can feel free to write to the press officers in the article for further clarification their names, phone number, and e-mails are attached."
12712,Most people protest abortion ban that the government issued suddenly.
12713,They all wear masks so I wouldn't expect much spread from those protests - but the goverment and those anti-covid people will blame everything on them.
12714,sooner or later US covid is gonna adopt the apple marketing strategy.
12715,Wave 1.9S extra long.
12716,So what
12717,"https://covidactnow.org/us/new_york-ny?s=1202293

See how it was high, now it is low?"
12718,Lower than most of the US and Europe?
12719,If there’s an effective vaccine that’s all that matters because you and I will have it.
12720,The crazies can do what they like
12721,UBI.
12722,It's not a perfect.
12723,"It's not a rescue boat, but a life raft and the country is sinking fast."
12724,Yea I hate being pissy at what I'm sure was a well intentioned post but it's just so ignorant of what Victoria is going through.
12725,I have friends and coworkers in other states who say the same thing as the person I replied to but do go out now and then (can see in the poster's history they do as well).
12726,They have literally no idea what it is like to experience four months of lockdown where you do not have the ability to go out.
12727,I mean even as a high risk individual they can go on a drive to a rural area and back without ever interacting with another human but we can't in Melbourne.
12728,There are a lot more examples of the difference.
12729,I'm not even sure why they posted about their own experience given it is completely irrelevant to what has happened Victoria (in particular Metro Melb).
12730,"How does it matter if we are in the first, second, third or 55th wave?"
12731,It's just stupid semantics that has no scientific consequences
12732,But we all know Bill is evil /s
12733,In general it is.
12734,I've worked with at least two of the companies you've mentioned and had absolutely no experience like that.
12735,"Just don't buy it at all to be honest, companies of that magnitude do not have a single culture or leadership style, it is an amalgamation of different departments, heads, leaders and cultures."
12736,Look at Ford for example - the way they work in North America is far different to that of Europe.
12737,"Maybe you've only had exposure to a very narrow stream of the company, or only in North America."
12738,"&gt; N95+surgical mask

how do you wear both of these together?"
12739,surgical mask over the n95 ?
12740,Me too - Melbourne Metro.
12741,So relieved that the strict lockdown paid off.
12742,Having my best friend over on Sunday night!
12743,"yeah, i'm so ready to take this..."
12744,That is True.
12745,I just though that since my example counted on 100 000 times the amount of reinfections I should also mention the fact that i hadnt counted on hidden first time cases.
12746,Same for legal drinking age
12747,My dad wanted to cut the seatbelts out of the car but decided against it cause it would hurt the resale value.
12748,im just trying to cope dude
12749,[removed]
12750,Also he could tell the governors to order a mandate.
12751,I mean Trump told them not to and that seems to be what they are doing.
12752,"As a kiwi, this is fucking terrifying."
12753,We've had this 0andemic going on for almost 12 months now.
12754,And you're still just in the first wave??
12755,What the ever loving fuck America.
12756,Get it together
12757,Not for lack of trying though (except maybe Brazil and Mexico early on).
12758,"In Colombia we had one of the longest lockdowns in the world (over 5 months) and even then, we're still top 10 for numbers of cases with an absolutely wrecked economy."
12759,Argentina is in a similar situation.
12760,"It is impossible to maintain a strict lockdown when a large percentage of the population lives from their day to day earnings; you don't work that day, you and your family don't eat that day."
12761,Doing everything right and containing this pandemic is a privilege of rich nations.
12762,"IMO, these anti maskers have maladaptive defense mechanisms which demonstrate poor emotion regulation."
12763,They clearly intellectualize their emotional reactions to public health recommendations to be oppositional and act out their feelings of animosity.
12764,"Also, I think these folks look to feelings of superiority and feeling special over others by having an affinity for oppositional beliefs."
12765,"It’s not critical thinking, it’s merely oppositional to justify their actions."
12766,"Given how people celebrating Halloween in Poland is a minority, I doubt it'll create that much damage."
12767,"Still, it would be better for them to stay at home."
12768,"After how many uses, a medical mask and glove should be disinfected and washed ?"
12769,"Also, what is the exact duration/ no."
12770,of uses after which the masks and gloves be discarded ?
12771,&gt;And this does not take into account that there is a lot more than 43 million cases in reality.
12772,"It shouldn't, either: I accept that genetic sequencing is a gold standard and not realistic in most cases."
12773,But there needs to be a confirmed reinfection in both cases and then you have a sensible numerator and denominator.
12774,Things have certainly changed simce the days of Daschle and McGovern
12775,Extremely interesting.
12776,"Have the statistics been doublechecked, do you know?"
12777,"Maybe its discussed somewhere else, as I understand it is not allowed to be discussed as a separate post here because its a blog

I have searced Google and it doesnt seem like anyone has debunked the numbers."
12778,So maybe the explanation is some where else like you mention.
12779,It's a shame that the healthcare environment is so toxic.
12780,"A lot of good nurses end up leaving, even in normal times."
12781,It goes to show how fucked america is in general that we dont know if its still the first or if its the third wave.
12782,"In general, or in the case of Covid?"
12783,It gets even more complex than that.
12784,"Europe didn't just ""get it from China""."
12785,"Their businessmen went to Wuhan, contracted it and then became the super spreaders in Europe."
12786,"Specifically one of Europe's largest outbreaks was in Italy, traced back to a German businessman."
12787,"So they didn't ""get it from China"" so much as ""They took it from China and spread it""."
12788,"Most of China's spread was confined to Wuhan and neighboring regions, and at most, the rest of Asia."
12789,"The Europeans spread the virus to Europe, then Americans and Europeans flying back to America from Europe spread it to America."
12790,That is why they share the same strain.
12791,"If I am not misreading it, they are saying 95% of the infected is from the European strain."
12792,"It won't help against the hardcore ""nay sayers"" but, please don't kill my hope, there's a huge crowd that simply doesn't know that there's several different vectors a vaccine can tackle a virus (weakened live virus, broken down pieces of the shell, potentially that rDNA kind of thing, ...) and hops onto the DNA-altering train because those people are shouting loud enough."
12793,"Just a few weeks ago I've had a chat with someone who's riding the Gates-is-Evil-train out of not knowing much; at the same time she's been advocating to use Windows on our office computers (which is the part where I said ""Gates is Evil"" twenty years ago, and even Microsoft started contributing to Linux' kernel to get rid of their dependence on Windows ;))"
12794,"That death rate took place in spring, when neither Norway, Finland nor Denmark had mask mandates either."
12795,"The thing is, most Swedes aren't personally anti-maskers."
12796,"They listen (often blindly) to authorities, and as long as the authorities aren't mandating them, they're worthless."
12797,"As soon as the authorities are saying we should use them on public transport, I expect high compliance."
12798,"So, ironically, the non-use of masks in Sweden is attributable to the very thing that American anti-maskers claim to hate."
12799,Meanwhile in America  .
12800,.
12801,.
12802,"&gt;secular

It's mostly culture of fear for death and the concept of family and community as a bigger family for the Chinese and all the other cultures that related/derived from Chinese (Korean, Japanese, Singapore, TW etc, even Vietnam)."
12803,"Obviously the political system there goes with it that values life much more compared to where ""Freedom"" goes first in other parts."
12804,Yes
12805,"By the time you're into *definitely* kill you status, vs., serious condition to be avoided at virtually any cost due to potential severe symptoms and lasting complications, your life expectancy is going to be pretty damn short no matter what."
12806,If you say so.
12807, Check out The NY Times article for yourself.
12808,"Another study from August had 2 main points to this question:
- infections in the wider community likely driving cases in schools
- children were more likely to acquire SARS-CoV-2 infection at home than in school

So, the study found that schools are safer than many alternatives for the students and teachers."
12809,"At our school, incidents where pod quarantining was required all happened in the first 2-weeks while everyone was out of school."
12810,They had gotten it before school was in session and brought it with them (mostly teachers and staff).
12811,"Once everyone was back in a school routine, the chances of a teacher or student contracting it dropped substantially because they were spending a majority of their time in a “safe zone” at school."
12812,"This is certainly not what I personally had predicted (I thought we’d be converted to virtual after 1 week), but the past 3-months have 100% proven me wrong."
12813,I just feel bad for a lot of friends and colleagues where schools are still locked down.
12814,"It’s not back to normal here by any means, but schools going back has been really heathy for the kids, families, and community."
12815,The virus is weird in how it works!
12816,I think we’ll be studying it for a LONG time trying to figure it out.
12817,"Link to the study with the bullet points above from Aug:
https://www.gov.uk/government/news/study-finds-very-low-numbers-of-covid-19-outbreaks-in-schools"
12818,Sorry I was just referencing the last two countries.
12819,Oz and NZ.
12820,"It is being collected, but blinded though."
12821,"Still need to analyzed, grouped, compared, etc."
12822,Reviewed is not analyzed.
12823,"And I wasn't talking about publishing, I was talking about submitting the findings (how long it takes from when you get the data to actually preparing the document that you submit)."
12824,But you are free to believe that it will happen the day after they hit 32.
12825,"I will be happy to be wrong, nobody is rooting for delaying the vaccine here."
12826,"Yes, I check the social media of a potential new hire."
12827,"If I find anti-mask content, I figure out a reason not to hire them."
12828,And I don't feel the least bit bad about it.
12829,"I want nothing to do with that kind of person, and will refuse to let someone like that infect (pun intended) my org."
12830,Sorry not sorry.
12831,True...
12832,Taiwan is.
12833,Vietnam and South Korea are not.
12834,"Though South Korea border is North Korea, so it's not that anyone is gonna go through that border without getting shot first, and it's not the vaccine they got shot at."
12835,It's still up 65-70% from last Tuesday's 3180 cases.
12836,Deaths are up 300% from last week's 4 deaths to 16.
12837,It may have been a backlog for such a large increase.
12838,Last week's update: [https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/jeofku/sweden\_public\_health\_authority\_update\_106380\_3180/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/jeofku/sweden_public_health_authority_update_106380_3180/)
12839,Then that’s a very bad look for the people downvoting lol
12840,Bu bu bu but flying is safe that industry sponsored report said so.
12841,My dad is a thirty+ year veteran of aviation both in the military and commercial sectors.

12846,"Make a mask better, but are shit on their own."
12847,"&gt; Sweden was doing relatively ok while it was only increased cases but low deaths

It goes like that in every outbreak since the beginning of the epidemic."
12848,"People always comment how low are the deaths while cases rise, then two or three weeks later the deaths come and some are surprised."
12849,That 5191 confirmed cases means at least 51 deaths are coming.
12850,:(
12851,Nice personal attack.
12852,The first study you linked was in a non-school environment.
12853,Of course younger kids are gonna have a high rate of household transmission.
12854,Their parents hug them and make them dinner even when they're sick and make their bed and go their laundry and everything.
12855,"Their household positivity rate was higher than 20-30 year old because I assume they are independent and don't rely on their parents, therefore have less interactions with roommates."
12856,It starts to climb as people get older and have more contact with spouses/kids.
12857,Not really shocked.
12858,And one outbreak in Israel isn't really relevant.
12859,You said (or whoever made the original claim) that the outbreak in the US was tied to schools opening and I said there's no evidence of that.
12860,You linked a non school Korean study and a Israeli outbreak.
12861,None of that shows the outbreak in the US is caused by schools.
12862,My alma mater Notre Dame reopened and did have a small outbreak of 200 students as people adjusted to the new rules.
12863,After a fte a week or two they figured it out.
12864,They are now down to 1 a day if even.
12865,I'm not saying open schools up with no rules.
12866,Plenty of schools in Illinois have opened up.
12867,Some had a few positive cases and then shut down again proactively till the cases clear then opened back up.
12868,Some have had 1 or 2 cases and traced correctly and is fine.
12869,My niece went home with a cold and the school wouldn't let her back until she had a negative test.
12870,"New Trier, one of the high school in Illinois, has 7 active cases and 42 students quarentining out of 3980 students."
12871,No students in Illinois have died since opening in August.
12872,"In fact, only 7 people under the age of 20 have died in the entire state since the start of the pandemic."
12873,"It doesn't list preexisting conditions, but I'm sure some of those 7 had serious health issues."
12874,Nobody is advocating for those types of kids to go back to school right now.
12875,Nor any teachers who are at risk.
12876,Nor any students whose parents are at risk.
12877,Yeah I had a hard zero this morning.
12878,My balls are definitely frozen

12886,"**Questions after the press conference:**

*The number of IVA cases is increasing, is it a rapid development?"
12887,"*

\- No, not really because we started at low levels."
12888,"We hope with the measures we are now taking and that conscious increase means that we do not end up in the same situation again, says Anders Tegnell."
12889,"*Due to the current situation in Europe and Sweden, the Stockholm Medical Association says that it is time to back away from the relief they have made on restrictions for people over the age of 70, what do you say about that?"
12890,"*

\- We continuously monitor all efforts we have in Sweden and try to adapt them as well as possible."
12891,Right now we are working on adapting them locally because the spread of infection looks so different in the country.
12892,"When it comes to people over the age of 70, it is a slightly different situation, we do not have a large increase among them at the moment."
12893,"It is important that we help protect them, but we see no reason to change that part today, says Anders Tegnell."
12894,*Why not introduce a discouragement on domestic travel if the situation looks so different in the country?
12895,"*

\- This is a discussion we are having."
12896,"So far, the differences are not so great, very many regions have an increase."
12897,We think it is important for the General advice to avoid too many contacts.
12898,"In fact, there is also quite clear advice about traveling because it almost always means new contacts with other people, says Anders Tegnell."

12902,There are varying rules on masks.
12903,I’m not sure how much they are being enforced.
12904,It sounds like they ensure the teachers have high pay and don’t need to put themselves in danger.
12905,Sounds good to me.
12906,It just sounds like you don’t like strong unions.
12907,Okay so that’s definitely not my tone and you misinterpreted it.
12908,It’s like me saying “can we win this game” when rooting for my favorite sports team.
12909,"I know this is hard to understand, but *perhaps* this person is different than you, and has a health condition that puts them at higher risk."
12910,"Crazy, right."
12911,It would be really impressive if Israel is able to deduce (with a few vaccines and in a short time) that the sinovac vaccine would work.

12913,My opa (grandfather) remarried and his 2nd wife was British.
12914,"She always trashed British cooking and said it's the reason they use so many condiments, flavour had to be added after cooking lol."
12915,"I have no idea how true this is, but she wasn't a great cook herself."
12916,"My very brief visit to England didn't involve a fancy restaurant, mostly just some delicious pub-fare but that was pretty tasty (meat pie one night, 2nd night was Yorkshire pudding, roast and veggies)."

12919,Anti-nicotine replacement therapy is a thing?
12920,The data is being collected as they go.
12921,The blinding is simply that we don't know who has the vaccine and who as the placebo.
12922,"As Boulware said, the data could be reviewed quickly."
12923,"Also note that Pfizer only released some of their Phase I/II data right before starting Phase III, and didn't release the full analysis until after Phase III had started."
12924,Publishing findings is not a prerequisite for the DSMB.
12925,"It's almost certainly one for the FDA, but again, they don't even plan on applying for EUA until the end of next month."
12926,and will you and trump be inside the landslide?
12927,"You would think enlightened self interest would help these assholes wear a mask and due social distancing, but nay these people will do what's far worse for them and those around them."
12928,perfect analogy for so many reasons.
12929,Just give it to us straight so we can plan for it.
12930,I just imagine them yelling “You can’t handle the TRUTH” backstage before getting on the podium.
12931,How do you know I'm undervaluing my mental health?

13008,The goal of their study was NOT to scientifically compare the efficacy of various protective measures.

13159,It doesn't work when the system is overwhelmed by 50k+ cases a day.
13160,Local lockdowns and this tier 0-4 nonsense doesn't work when you don't even prevent travel throughout different areas.
13161,It has to be down nationally so there are no hidden reservoirs of virus in non-locked down areas.

13202,The mRNA injected will be gone not too long after having received it.

13267,"Again, I believe I’ve made it clear that these are predictions of what society’s risk tolerance is."
13268,At no point did I adopt them as my own.
13269,I encourage you to re-read what the posts say before responding to them.
13270,"100,000 deaths I believe is within society’s risk tolerance."
13271,"We know that 60,000 flu deaths is because there was a year in the last decade that saw that number come to fruition and nobody batted an eye."
13272,I do not believe the flu is the upper-bound of society’s risk tolerance either.
13273,"I suspect that 100,000 straddles that line, if we aren’t already."
13274,"Without context or an appreciation for aggregate statistics, you can make any number sound prohibitively large."
13275,"For example, I can say, with palpable emotion “one death is too many!” It’ll sound good."
13276,I can also say “650 preventable deaths and all we had to do was wear a damn mask!” It would also sound good.
13277,"Point being, society tolerates needless death."
13278,It does every year.
13279,"Car wrecks, viruses, RX overdoses, alcohol poisoning, etc... Society allows for a certain number of death and keeps going."
13280,"Right now, Coronavirus is not at an allowable amount of death."
13281,"With a vaccine, it will be at a point where it gets to the allowable amount."
13282,"Again, I suspect that is 100,000."
13283,"We need to define it exactly, then use statistics to extrapolate what gets us there."
13284,Masks need to go at that point and not a second later.
13285,They are a significant hindrance on the human experience.
13286,"I mean, yeah, this is reddit, where groupthink is the prevailing mindset."
13287,Of what?
13288,"Jokes on them, I'm most of those things, but I wear a mask all the time, even when I'm driving alone or sitting in my office."
13289,"No, you aren't."
13290,"LOL I know, I’ve been to Paris a few times."
13291,But there is something appealing about a culture in which cheese and wine is deeply ingrained.
13292,"Sure, whatever, have fun living life scared."
13293,Nothings changed for me.
13294,"Keeping deaths low, well done."
13295,"It isn’t that hard to make a fan and filter hose combo with a battery which doesn’t leak and this is that, and if it doesn’t provide enough air (which it provides plenty of on speed 3, even if doing moderate exercising), you suck it through the mask or draw more air through the filter of the fan unit."
13296,I replaced the POS kn95 mask it came with with a well fitting silicone sealing n95 and that makes a big difference.
13297,You can cut a hole in any mask and if you cut a good hole it is a super tight fitting that doesn’t leak at all at the hose junction.
13298,"There is literally no downside, it’s like having a little electric motor pushing your bicycle."
13299,“What if it doesn’t make you go fast enough or you run out of battery?”  You just pedal like a caveman like you would be doing already if you didn’t have the motor.
13300,It’s just doing some of the leg work for you.
13301,This fan is like that.
13302,"A powered bonus with no downside, and it’s filter is a 99% filter which is better than the 95% of the n95 so it is a pretty significant upside too."
13303,"The filter it is drawing air through is very similar to the ones inside those pink 3M p100 rectangular cartridges you use with half face respirators, you could probably just bust one of those cartridges open and remove the filter from it and put it in this if you think it’s a cheap knockoff filter."
13304,You can absolutely feel it drawing air through the filter if you put your hand by the intake.
13305,"No air flows if you cover intake completely, any leaks are small and pretty insignificant."
13306,Fan uses some decent power but it has a lithium battery the size of my thumb that delivers the juice needed.
13307,"Only lasts for like 2 hours on speed 3, but speed 2 produces more air than I breathe anytime other than exercising, and speed 1 is perfect for relaxing hard and lasts for like 10 hrs."
13308,"Technology has improved beyond what you imagine if you see obvious cheap snake oil with this, you should try one and plan to return it to judge it for yourself, free shipping and free returns on Amazon."
13309,The one I have is 5000 but I don't really take it every day.
13310,We've done pretty well overall.
13311,"Our hospitals have never been overwhelmed, generally everyone are wearing masks, deaths have remained low."
13312,We're not perfect but we've done ok
13313,Like I've said before.
13314,Remember all the extra security measures brought in after 9-11?
13315,Did they remove them?
13316,Even after all [the press] (https://abcnews.go.com/US/tsa-fails-tests-latest-undercover-operation-us-airports/story?id=51022188) showing how [ineffective] (https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/jun/07/tsa-failures-bombs-tests) they [were] (https://www.forbes.com/sites/michaelgoldstein/2017/11/09/tsa-misses-70-of-fake-weapons-but-thats-an-improvement/#276c033b2a38)?

13358,These are valid measurements for what can be considered success.

13360,"I repeat, Norway doing well does not make every other country worse."
13361,"I'm going to honest, if it meant I could get a job again, not lose my car and apartment, and didn't have to worry about a health pandemic, I'd totally be willing to go back into full lockdown for a few months."
13362,"It would be much better than dragging this misery, I'm tired of the bank calling everyday about when are they going to have ""their"" money."

&gt;Spain does extensive contact tracing, so Álvarez was also able to analyze how much schools are contributing to the spread of the coronavirus."
13625,Álvarez said his research suggests the answer is: not much.
13626,"He found that, for all the students and staff who tested positive, 87% of them did not infect anyone else at the school."
13627,They were single cases.
13628,"&gt;
&gt;""We are not sure that the environments of the schools may not have a small and systematic effect,"" said Álvarez, ""But it's pretty clear that they don't have very major epidemic-changing effects, at least in Spain, with the measures that are being taken in Spain."""
13629,"&gt;
&gt;These safety measures include mask-wearing for all children older than 6, ventilation, keeping students in small groups or ""bubbles,"" and social distancing of 1.5 meters — slightly less than the recommended 6 feet in the United States."

13728,1 million Uyghurs are terrorists?
13729,Have they been convicted?
13730,Or at least tried?
13731,Have you seen the videos that have come out of those camps?
13732,How is any of that even humane in the slightest?
13733,I'd say it's diagnostic criteria in and of itself.
13734,"&gt;(no proof of significant confounding factors)

Of course there is no proof when you cannot measure them in the first place."
13735,Death really isn't the worst thing that can happen to you.
13736,What's the point of living without liberty?
13737,This post is blatant misinformation and the mods will allow it because anything that suggests herd immunity is a meme and we're gonna have an apocalyptic second wave is upvoted to the top.
13738,"The posts around here constantly seem to contradict one another, goddamn."
13739,"Italy seems particularly vulnerable to long term restrictions, due to the deriving such a high percentage of GDP from tourism."
13740,"I live in Japan, which actual takes in more money from tourism than Italy year on year, but the percentage is much lower - 7% vs. 13% ."
13741,"Despite that the damage here has been enormous, and the government has begun some questionable campaigns to spur domestic travel, while still keeping international tourism locked down."
13742,As an EU member Italy would probably face more resistance if it were to try to heavily regulate border crossings.
13743,You’re in a tough spot.
13744,Buona fortuna!
13745,"Well, they shouldn't have brought it up, but this is a US based site with mostly US based users."
13746,And those not in the US on this sub want to shit on it at every opportunity.
13747,So that's why there's so many US-based posts.

13752,How well did the researchers match their subjects to mass outbreak zones?
13753,Selfishness is a personality disorder?
13754,Stoical nod of recognition from Canada.
13755,The point is to understand why and follow up with the right measures.
13756,The same way there were studies to understand why people wouldn’t wear car seatbelts or would drink and drive.
13757,💯
13758,Calling asylums “mental healthcare” is like calling prisons “rehabilitation” or “correctional”

13761,I have a couple friends whose kids started middle school this fall - having NO HELP to guide them into the transition from elem to actual school.
13762,It has to be awful and so discouraging.
13763,There was a push in our county to add 6th and 9th grade to the kids who get to come back first as it's such a big life change for them.
13764,He's probably referring to the fact the total mortality rate of NYC has decreased despite the added effects of the coronavirus.
13765,Source?
13766,"One of the long term consequences of the 1918 pandemic was a wave of autoimmune encephalitis in the 1920s, followed by early onset parkinsons in a subset of survivors of said encephalitis."
13767,Blah blah blah.
13768,Studies bad (no proof of significant confounding factors) Different counties in a single US state are certainly far more comparable than entirely different countries.
13769,Thumbsup.gif
13770,Which one?
13771,There are multiple.
13772,This seems a little tabloid-y.
13773,I have bod and know lots of other with bod and avpd as well and they all wear masks.
13774,"Antisocial personality and Narcissistic personality sure, but to just say ""personality disorder"" is misleading."
13775,I guess I need to be sure to say that I am introverted not anti-social (in regards to empathy).
13776,"I don't like being around other people, but I certainly have empathy and have been wearing a mask everywhere to protect others."
13777,I also believe that we need to do more to help those who are less fortunate.
13778,So in that sense I'm not anti-social.
13779,"Makes it slightly confusing, but I'm good with just saying that I'm introverted to avoid getting it confused and lumped in with these types of people who don't care if someone dies from their stupidity."
13780,"It wasnt enough, iirc the gov fauled in implementing a proper contact tracing mechanism"
13781,"Well, going from poor (or even terrible) mental health care to almost no mental health care isn't exactly a step up."
13782,Ummm that doesn't mean immunity goes away.
13783,T-cell immunity exists without antibodies.
13784,"Considering the lack of widespread reinfections, it's pretty clear that people are still immune."
13785,"The take-home point from this article should be: ""Antibodies tests are an unreliable way of calculating the % immune population."""
13786,"I am introvert with anexiety and im antisocial, but i still wear a mask"
13787,Don’t cry abt it anymore
13788,"Sure, keep your head buried in the sand man."
13789,"Death is FINAL, there is no coming back from it, I would hedge my bets 100 times out of 100 if it means lowering my chance of dying from anything."
13790,"That's why I wear my seatbelt, why I look both ways before crossing the street, why I got all my vaccines and why I get my blood work done every year."
13791,"All those certainly come with some ""risk"" of an adverse effect occurring but it certainly won't be worse than death."

13793,"Qatar study and t-cell response as well as observations on how little reinfections have popped up over the last 8 months, don’t cry about it on the subreddit just look at the science and accept this post added nothing new"
13794,"&gt; Bush read a book

Impressive, General Bush"
13795,Sure kid.
13796,they gave me my own office so I wouldn´t have to wear a mask... xD
13797,I’d rather educate children more on how to be lateral thinkers than go down the slippery slope of censorship.
13798,Give people the tools to think logically and rationally and easily identify misinformation.
13799,"The same people who don’t want to wear a mask would be the same group who don’t return shopping trolleys.... they espouse personal responsibility, but never practice it themselves."
13800,"I pooped a large ""C"" yesterday."
13801,I was impressed.
13802,It reminds me that we're all in a shitty situation.
13803,Be seeing you.
13804,Lost cause but respect to that man.
13805,A lot of this is cases imported from East Europe.
13806,Most of it come from Poland with construction workers.
13807,They don't do voluntary tests by the borders.
13808,We will shut this down from December.
13809,"They'll need full quarantine and testing from then, or they'll be denied entry."
13810,It should have been done in March.
13811,Did you also see how the rest of the country is high because of NY?
13812,Probably not because you didn't read the article I linked.
13813,GRIFFFITTHHH!!!
13814,!
13815,If you can't not eat for 3 hours I think you need to re-evaluate your life.
13816,Yuck
13817,There has been.
13818,"Also anecdotal, but I have 3 college friends who got sick back in March, tested positive, and are now sick and testing positive again."
13819,Less than 25% of the US has gotten sick.
13820,"I’d imagine it’s partly because you aren’t guaranteed to even be exposed to it, partly because some people are asymptomatic, and partly because after getting sick they realized maybe they need to wear a mask."
13821,But reinfection has certainly happened.
13822,"It just isn’t some massive wave, which nobody would even expect right now anyways."
13823,The numbers would be the same or far less than normal infection
13824,"He was an OB, right?"
13825,In the 80s?
13826,Asia and the Middle East seem to be doing ok
13827,Very interesting.
13828,We should definitely check out Sweden’s Universal Health Care system and try it out here in the states.
13829,They seem to be on to something.
13830,There are a couple of reports about people being reinfected with a genetically different strain.
13831,Easy to find on Google.
13832,Masks protect others.

13834,"Nobody gives a shit about you stick you head in the sand takes over scientific studies but if you're going to personally take on a study, post your statement and back it up with info/data."

13836,"https://emanuelkarlsten.se/number-of-deaths-in-sweden-during-the-pandemic-compared-to-previous-years-mortality/

More importantly the logic behind the topic is what's bad."
13837,Literally any improvement would look great compared to how bad their spring was.
13838,Declaring victory for them at this point is disingenuous
13839,"There are 1.16m people in the world who would disagree with you, but they can't because they're dead."
13840,I’m pretty sure asylums were a bad thing
13841,"if I see people like that on any social media with a subscribe or friend function, I just unsubscribe, unfriend or block which is resulting in a nice and clean news feed of catpics and news from actual news orgs I subscribe to."
13842,"""You have to get a vaccine every few months to keep the correct level of government chips in your bloodstream to track you""
Karens, when they find out about that"
13843,Really?
13844,Who would have thought it?
13845,/s
13846,"Yeah I was surprised by that percentage, but they had to get the test so they could get to work right?"
13847,No shit.
13848,People don't react well when you post studies to try and imply that are mentally ill. Who woulda guessed?
13849,Where any criticism to one's belief system is either fake news or a global conspiracy theory
13850,The only safe place besides Iqaluit is Atlantic Canada.
13851,The bubble has worked great!
13852,"Sure, waaaaay less people but there's a lot of ""essential"" workers who leave to work in the infected and poorly handled provinces."
13853,I think the idea of the cuba-Atlantic bubble is a bad idea.
13854,And your statistics for all the drugs they approved that they shouldn’t have?
13855,Do you have any facts to back up your claim of incompetence compared to when Obama was president?
13856,I guess when this person was appointed all the experts who work for the FDA and probably have for decades also suddenly became people who are terrible at their jobs?
13857,Is that how it works?
13858,"If that’s the case, the fact that Trump appointed some guy is not the story here."
13859,It’s that the staff of the FDA has no integrity and THEY should all be fired.
13860,Because we absolutely don’t need people approving food and drug safety based on who is in office.
13861,That Trump is president is irrelevant.
13862,Right but what happens after lockdown is lifted?
13863,We start again towards the inevitable 3rd lockdown.
13864,"Meanwhile, right now people are suffering in all sorts of ways."
13865,"I dunno, I just can't see how this ends."
13866,It is higher in Italy than in France actually.
13867,Lil bro lol stop editing in petty insults obviously you should be able to figure out im saying their info didn’t add anything new
13868,I do find it amusing how they shat on America for weeks/months... and now look at them.
13869,You reap what you sow.
13870,I had a trip to the UK booked for three weeks in April.
13871,"I had planned to visit castles all over England and Wales, as well as military museums like the Tank Museum at Bovington and the dockyards at Chatham and Portsmouth, the HMS Belfast in London, among other places and sights."
13872,"I had hoped to take a second trip in December, to see Christmas markets in some combination of Germany, the Netherlands, Italy and Austria."
13873,All those plans have been dashed pretty hard.
13874,"Even in the best case for 2021, I’m unlikely to get to see and do all that I hoped to see and do in 2020."
13875,"I don’t want to travel or even to book travel until I’m vaccinated, and that means that I likely won’t be able to travel in the early spring as I normally prefer."
13876,hotlavatube.
13877,This guy shits.
13878,"For a while, but those countries are creating a generation of debt and interest payments with this."
13879,there is no money.
13880,Any money that is being given by the government is being borrowed from central banks and will be repaid for decades.
13881,I never said they were.
13882,I made a point that low empathy does not make one dumb.
13883,Please consider the context.
13884,I WANT TO KNOW WHY ITS ALWAYS “... STUDY FINDS” AND NEVER “STUDY FINDS... THAT NOT WEARING A MASK IS LINKED TO PERSONALITY DISORDER” I NEED TOOO KNOW
13885,This is not a vaccine
13886,"Absolutely, we have to remain vigilant if we want to protect the safety we've worked so hard to claw back."
13887,Oh yeah.
13888,Murdoch can fuck right off
13889,I thought we established this summer that you could get the virus again.
13890,Especially because a handful of people have already caught it again.
13891,"About 70,000 people in the US got covid today."
13892,"In 2-4 weeks, about 1000 of them will be dead."
13893,They just don't know it yet.
13894,How can people be blase when faced with that?
13895,When can we start basing the severity of this virus on mortality and not infection rate?
13896,"Cases in the US have been climbing steadily since Sept 7, but deaths have remained the same."
13897,Does that not imply the mortality rate is actually getting lower?
13898,Funny.
13899,I wear a mask and exhibit all of these traits toward anyone who doesn't
13900,They We Todd It.
13901,[removed]
13902,I completely agree
13903,You cant compare the flu to COVID.
13904,They're very different types of virus.
13905,"Odds might be worse, sure, but it is never a guarantee."
13906,"Same story in Poland, except even worse because average Polish nurse is over 50 years old, so something like a third of them are themselves in the risk group."
13907,"Weird, I see very few masks at Trump political rallies, so that would imply that... never mind."
13908,I've heard great things about Delta.
13909,Thanks for sharing your information about masks.
13910,Lots of interesting information about masks in this thread.
13911,I'm not a doctor nor in high-risk situations so we are just wearing disposable masks ...
13912,I figured you couldn't buy anything like an N95 in Canada right now ... will need to look it up for those times we are on transit etc.
13913,For now we're laying pretty low.
13914,Good luck with your schooling/doctoring.
13915,Good luck in the US November 3rd.
13916,Sending good neighborly thoughts.
13917,Exactly.
13918,So sorry to you not being able to see your family either.
13919,It all just sucks but like you said it’s best to be safe
13920,"They would need roughly 2 weeks after they hit 32 to deblind the study, so if they are not there yet, late November will be our best estimate."
13921,"Today was lower, 12,687 cases, but that's still cold comfort, still equal to 355,000 US cases"
13922,Don't forget lack of access to medical care
13923,Everyone needs a cabin in the woods of their own!
13924,Oh how I wish.
13925,"I think it’s a also matter of scale - if you only see a dozen flu cases in person over the years, four of them your own, and none are too bad, you think that’s what flu will always be like for you and people like you."
13926,"My own experience was worse, so I make more of an effort to avoid it happening again to me or anyone I would infect along the way if I got sick."
13927,I’m just glad I’m not the one who infected my mom!
13928,"She was a teacher in a different state, probably caught it from the kids."
13929,"But I also have family in various medical fields - when you’ve seen two thousand flu cases ranging in severity from moderately miserable to quickly-dead, in everyone from toddlers to waitresses to grandmas, or you deal with the guilt of a kid who killed their parent/grandparent by bringing it home, you weigh the risk/hassle/cost/benefit ratio of a flu shot differently."
13930,"I’m in the US, so availability and custom and cost affect the attitude, too."
13931,I think about 45% of adults get a flu shot annually.
13932,"Doesn’t take much effort, it is often free through work or insurance or community programs (unlike the rest of our terribly expensive medical care), and you can do it at any pharmacy without a doctor."
13933,"Since the cost of hospitalization or treatment for a bad case will bankrupt/severely financially hurt most of us, we literally can’t afford the risk of the flu, so if a free/cheap shot lowers that risk, a lot of us will take it."
13934,"Individuals may be rich, but the population as a whole is poor, and can’t afford medical care."
13935,"(2/3 of all bankruptcies in the US are linked to medical issues - either the bills themselves, or lost work from losing jobs when people get sick/injured."
13936,Our social safety nets are pitiful and paid sick/vacation time is not required of employers.)
13937,"So people, who refuse wearing a mask actually have a medical reason: Psychopathy."
13938,People on Facebook =\= friends.
13939,Except that's not what it is.
13940,It gets blasted because it shows he has 0 knowledge of the scientific method or what scientific studies are for.
13941,&gt; The rest are just assholes.
13942,"Imagine if you could diagnose people with ""asshole""-personality disorder."
13943,"the problem is not with how common mental disorders are (they are), but with people with mental disorders running the county / states"
13944,That explains a lot
13945,I feel you.
13946,"My family is split between the US, Canada, and U.K."
13947,"It really sucks not being able to see them, but at least we’re being safe."
13948,"Whatever they put in the food probably doesn't help, and countless people with chronic diseases using medication meant for short term (eg: PPIs) probably has some kind of side effects."
13949,"Permanent sleep withdrawal since pushing for conditions (both work, but also living situations) that promotes healthy sleep will fuck people up, too."
13950,I know someone who did this and died...... please don't do this.
13951,I'm from NC too.
13952,You may eventually get reinfected as well so it would probably be useless.
13953,My mother is a doctor and has been seeing patients for 7 months through this in a hard hit area and has managed to not get it yet.
13954,Please don't do this!!
13955,!
13956,"Frustrating news, but not a deal breaker."
13957,Vaccine shots will have to be seasonal then.
13958,They meant the other fuck.
13959,I wouldn’t.
13960,There’s evidence that getting a lower initial dose lowers the severity of the ultimate disease but it’s going to be really hard to try to get a low dose in a way that ensures you’ll be infected at all.

13962,I dont see why youre being downvoted.
13963,They are clearly currently comparable.

13965,The United States' current systems to help those who need help are fundamentally broken and in dire need of reform.
13966,Prisons need to be changed from a form of punishment to a form of rehabilitation (just look at how Norway does it).
13967,Current mental health services are lacking or nonexistent.
13968,Homelessness is also not taken care of properly.
13969,"I think I read somewhere that there's currently more empty houses in the the whole of USA than there are homeless people, and when that's the case, something's seriously wrong with the current system."
13970,That's what the prison system is for!
13971,"Oh and of course if you're not violent or able to commit a crime, that's a state problem ie: that's a personal problem maybe you should go to church so you have a support network in God."

13975,"For someone who studied virology and demands science, you sure do like to make claims that are not 100% proven true."
13976,"This isn't even accounting for the fact that the data sets from schools are incomplete and hard to trace because most schools do not require a negative test to come back, and most of the time when a student shows symptoms they only have to quarantine from 10-14 days (or with doctor's clearance, not necessarily a test), which results in no test."
13977,"A student could potentially be positive, but never test and the stats would never show it."
13978,"Also, most recommendations are to open schools when the community transmission is lower then 5%, that is not true uniformly across the United States."

13983,"We have massive levels of undiagnosed mental illnesses in this country, we glorify sociopathy in many ways, and masculinity is as toxic as it is fragile."
13984,Couple that with being a guinea pig for world wide disinformation techniques and none of this is shocking.

13986,"Delays in infection rate are a good sign, pointing to prevention measures actually helping in avoiding Covid."
13987,"It's not so good for those eligible for the first batches of the vaccine that were already produced, though."

13989,well I feel stupid....thanks for correcting me.
13990,[removed]
13991,Agree concerning the vaccine.
13992,If it is effective.
13993,Is the second wave gonna be worse than the first?
13994,The fear factor is clearly not there anymore so hopefully we won't have any complete lockdowns.
13995,But is a similar situation to March on the cards?
13996,Once France comes out of the next lockdown they will be helpful of course.
13997,When Macron said they would do all they could to prevent a second lockdown I initially assumed he meant they would be taking a tried and tested solution from Asia to make sure theyd never have to do it.
13998,"Unfortunately he meant, haha, fuck you all, I dont give a shit."
13999,Chinese concentration camps arent fake news.
14000,China is an authoritarian dictatorship and the closest thing to 1984 currently around.

14002,I think we found one!
14003,"Fuck off, it's not Kyle ( searching for the manager)"
14004,No.
14005,I would completely side with you and agree that empathy is profoundly needed here if denialism and a refusal to accept basic epedimiological science was not at the heart of this discussion.
14006,"The science was clear and profound regarding the Corona virus, and to say that people cannot be held accountable for their actions because they were juiced by propaganda allows for almost all actions in history to be forgiven."
14007,We are past empathy and barreling towards scientific realism.
14008,There is no room for excuse when the ignorance of one can lead to the viral infection and subsequent death of another.
14009,Why you still friends with them?
14010,The baby boomers were raised by a bunch of people who went through the extreme trauma of WWII and didn't know about/believe in therapy.
14011,That has to have something to do with it.
14012,"When in doubt, exercise your personality disorder by blaming the sub."
14013,I love this idea.
14014,But it would require education.

14016,"I regularly have people who take time off, only to be responding to emails, logging work, etc during their supposed vacation."
14017,I always tell them I won't respond to their emails or review their work while they're out.
14018,"So, if we were to guarantee the items you listed, we'd need to somehow teach people to utilize them."
14019,It’s also linked to a lung disorder.

14024,  I read that this virus isn't mutating in a way the regular flu does.
14025,There is a good change a vaccine for Covid will last a lot longer than the annual flu vaccine.
14026,And then they ask why it isn't getting better.
14027,&gt; and the buck stops where?

14030,"Well, that helps to explain Switzerland's 220,000 US equivalent cases each of the last three days--Everybody was acting like the virus was either gone, in denial, and then conspiring to keep gatherings like this secret from the authorities like its just a game"
14031,☝️Exhibit A everybody
14032,Please scroll up to the parent comment to understand what you said.
14033,"The antisocial profile was linked to higher scores in the personality questions related to “callousness, deceitfulness, hostility, impulsivity, irresponsibility, manipulativeness, and risk-taking”, antisocial traits which, the study notes, “are typically present in people diagnosed with Antisocial Personality Disorder (ASPD)""."
14034,So in the US we just call them Trump fans.
14035,I think these people just have bad breath
14036,"BBC is giddy for this news, nothing like causing a panic to get those clicks way up!"
14037,Asylums are not mental health care and worse than prisons.
14038,You have  a rosy view of asylums.
14039,Nobody got help in these horrible places.
14040,"That's 0.1% of diagnosed cases, not real total infections."
14041,Yeah.
14042,They think for themselves
14043,Went to the park last Sunday in Dublin.
14044,I'd say 70% of the attenders weren't using masks still.
14045,I have little faith in this place and lockdown 2 won't work as well as the first one
14046,natural herd immunity is like the worst excuse to fucking up the response of the virus.
14047,No they’re not.
14048,"They’re a hub for infection, this is common knowledge."
14049,"There is definitely a correlation to in-person schools to case increases, at least in areas that are open."
14050,"[Since reopening of schools, children cases have increased by a ton, now making up 10% of US cases (as opposed to previous 2%)."

14053,"  They said an independent group would need to analysis the results, then they would forward to the FDA for additional analysis."
14054,This could all take up to 3 week I read once they hit their target infection level.
14055,That's just not true though.
14056,Look at Europe.
14057,Many countries locked down hard there and are now seeing a resurgence.
14058,Lockdowns only delay the inevitable.
14059,"accessible, yes!"
14060,But most often it does not comply with safe drinking water standards.
14061,Lead beeing one of the latest examples where it was [shown](https://www.forbes.com/sites/alexknapp/2013/01/03/how-lead-caused-americas-violent-crime-epidemic/) that reduction of lead pipeing decreases violent crime significantly.
14062,But there are also a lot of other issues.
14063,Both of those statements can be true though.
14064,So they dont contradict eachother.
14065,Excessdeaths are not calculated the same way as total deaths per capita.
14066,Im also not saying that this (if True) says anything about Sweden coronas corona responsen.
14067,Or that its a Victor.
14068,If true it is extremely interesting though.
14069,I would like to know more about the reasons behind it.
14070,Also the respected journalist I mentioned in a other post is Emanuel.
14071,"He is looking in to it as I understand, and since he is very objective/good im looking forward to his post about it."
14072,"I’m just saying, what wave were in is arbitrary and not that significant."
14073,The numbers themselves are more importantz
14074,"shithead, you just said "" Weird how I can be diagnosed with this disorder "" as a statement that you have already in fact been diagnosed wit one."
14075,"Don’t talk that communist talk.... source: uneducated, brainwashed American"
14076,You sure about that?
14077,I've seen others saying you maintain antibodies for years/decades with all the main vaccines for other viruses.
14078,You argue about science on Facebook?
14079,"I mean you could always not include “that”, for example it could be “ study finds not wearing  a mask is linked to personality disorder"
14080,"The article itself said it is responsible for surges, If they open in a rushed manner, but people here would think that opening schools is the same as opening without health measures."
14081,My former high school has been open since August with in person school 50% online 50% zoom and has had to my knowledge 0 cases of coronavirus.
14082,Except it isn’t nonsense?
14083,Seems to be the medical consensus.
14084,"Whether you’re less prone to infection, idk."
14085,But you most certainly can get it twice.
14086,"Anecdotal evidence, but I personally know people who HAVE gotten it twice (tested), 4+ months apart."
14087,"Our Health Service was dead long before Covid, but this is just too much, and our ruling party is blaming everybody else for this."
14088,National TV is showing happy people and economy growing.
14089,Nothing changed in Eastern Europe.
14090,"Yeah you can get KN95s but those aren't the same as N95, the 3M masks fit so much better and are far higher quality"
14091,Read: “We won’t reduce any of our restrictions until 70% of you are vaccinated”
14092,&gt;It's still very very important as T-cell immunity is much more damaging to the host.
14093,Link to this?
14094,"Is the ""shopping cart test"" the one where you can see if someone's an asshole if they just leave the shopping cart in the middle of the parking lot instead of putting back in its place?"
14095,"That's more of a secondary cause, isn't it?"
14096,None of this would have ever happened if China had their shit together in that lab at Wuhan.
14097,Or untrained cops with guns.

14102,Except there literally is a 2-3 month immunity period.
14103,Source: people got sick twice.
14104,If you become immune after that would be impossible.
14105,I already gave you a list of reasons it isn’t as wide spread as you’d believe.
14106,But you didn’t respond to any of those.
14107,Wow that is fucked up.
14108,Sorry to hear that
14109,I’ve seen KN95s at Staples in store and online
14110,Maybe you can help me out with a thing I found.
14111,"https://www.who.int/bulletin/online_first/en/
In the ""research"" tab just above ""Policy and Practice"" you will find:
BLT.20.265892
It says corona case-mortality rate is 0.23% which can be even lower according to the author."
14112,"It is peer-reviewed, it is also a literary review article, whose sources are those that denote case compared to death toll."
14113,Can I take it to be true scientific truth or like ???
14114,For the rest.. Tell me about it.
14115,I can just cry at how badly the standard of information is for some people.
14116,Its so twisted you can't even educate them.
14117,Btw - do you know where I can find what strand PCR tests for?
14118,I have been looking for it but I only end up with conspiracy crap
14119,A personality disorder?
14120,LOL ...the author must have a brain disorder...
14121,I am a huge proponent of schools being open.
14122,"The societal benefits of schools are just something that need to be accepted even if it is a driver of Covid spread

That said, you are out of your mind if you honestly believe that schools are not at least PARTIALLY responsible for the Covid explosion seen worldwide in the past month"
14123,"&gt; I have three P100 half-face respirators and extra filters

Those are leagues more comfortable than regular masks."
14124,They feel like scuba regulators and help you breathe deeply.

14126,Anyone have an alternate link on this research/topic?

14149,The vaccines in development are currently in stage 3 testing.
14150,This is mass testing on several thousand people.
14151,Vaccines are cleared for use after successfully proving effective and safe in stages 1-3.
14152,"So yes these vaccines have passed all standard vaccine testing, arguably more so because many of them are being tested on many more people than is standard in stage 3 testing."
14153,"As much as people think it’s true, vaccines do not undergo long term safety testing before approval on the population."

14184,Spreading the narrative that one person controls the direction of an entire country when in fact it's a large government apparatus making the decision is dangerous and leads to distrust.

14186,"Yes, all the major vaccines being trialled in Europe and the US, except the Johnson &amp; Johnson vaccine, require two doses 4-6 weeks apart, and full immunity probably doesn't kick in until 6-ish weeks after the second dose."

14188,"You can calculate it yourself from the data here:

14199,&gt;And our government just... loosened quarantine rules.
14200,Now if you had contact with someone infected all the people in your house are free to roam about.
14201,":/

&gt;The rules were fucked up before that too - the quarantine was only for 10 days so if you infected someone in your house it was likely they would still be infectious when the quarantine ends."
14202,And if you had symptoms after those 10 days of quarantine you were also free to go.
14203,No tests for anyone.unless they have very heavy onset of symptoms.
14204,Do people who have to quarantine get financially supported?
14205,If not then they're not going to comply.
14206,No one has any agenda lol.
14207,It is just fucking common sense here that children massing in schools would be a huge vector for virus transmission.
14208,"I don't care what the experts are saying, because the reality is they aren't sure themselves."
14209,It will take decades of research to realize wtf is happening with this virus.
14210,Scientists at the moment are looking at incomplete data or limited data.
14211,"Yeah, you're right."
14212,Probably just thought over the top.

14223,"There testing is maxed out, so there are not showing a growth in cases."
14224,I guess we'll finally know the answer to the age-old question: Can your IQ be a negative value?
14225,No vaccine is tested for long term side effects before approval for general use.
14226,Approval for general use happens after successful stage 3 testing which is conducted on several thousand people.
14227,Long term effects are checked in stage 4 investigations over many years but this happens when it is used in the general population.
14228,The vaccines currently in development have been tested as thoroughly as any vaccine you have taken.
14229,Honestly it's so insulting to lump mentally different people in with the likes of anti-maskers.
14230,They're totally capable of wearing masks and understanding why anyone would do it.

14233,Wearing a mask is a signal that you're a d*eep st@te ch!ld r@pist!
14234,"It's true, I saw it on Qa#on's Facebook page!"
14235,You have to consider the trade off.
14236,"Highway driving is actually fairly safe, injuries per miles driven is pretty small, especially if you eliminate other risk factors on your end - driving drunk/high/texting/exhausted (though other drivers who *are* are still a risk factor to you)."
14237,"Same goes for cycling, the risk of serious injury per time is relatively small."
14238,The other consideration is exponentiation.
14239,"Simply put, the injuries per mile driven/biked is pretty linear."
14240,"More drivers means more injuries, but adding 1,000,000 more drivers adds 1,000x as many injuries as adding 1,000."
14241,Linear correlation.
14242,"Because COVID experiences exponential growth, adding 1,000,000 more exposures increases infections at a *greater* rate than adding, 1,000."
14243,"This is a huge problem because it means that you need *more* than 1000x as much medical intervention if 1,000x as many people are risking infection."
14244,"tl;dr COVID is much riskier than driving on the highway or riding a bike, and the risk scales *extremely fast* the more people risk exposure."
14245,"I wish the government messaging was something like ""we are all soldiers in a war now."""
14246,Soldiers take risks to protect each other.
14247,Taking a vaccine that has been safely tested on tens of thousands of trial participants is a very low risk that we should all willingly take to protect our fellow soldier-citizens.
14248,The south Isn’t just full of a bunch of backwards redneck racist hicks and treating them like they are is pretty shitty.
14249,There are plenty of progressive hotspots in the bigger cities.
14250,8% positivity rate is incredibly high.
14251,Things are not getting better in Florida at all.
14252,FAKE NEWS- FLORIDA GOVERNOR
14253,"That's still because of COVID though, even if it's not from COVID."
14254,Should those deaths be considered COVID deaths-no.
14255,But would many of them have happened if this pandemic wasn't a thing?
14256,Also probably no.
14257,I hate it here.
14258,Maybe we’ve *verified* 24 reinfections.
14259,"But even with the millions of people infected, I’m not sure how many we should expect to have documented given constrained resources and the fact that maybe half of all people who get this are asymptomatic."
14260,"I’m certain the number of people who’ve received a positive Covid test after a negative one is much, much higher than 24."
14261,"AFAIK, there would need to be a coordinated focus on people who’ve already been infected and remain at high risk for reinfection."
14262,"The incidence of this virus is still low relative to the overall population, so I can think of a group (outside healthcare workers) for whom that would be a concern."
14263,"AFAIK, there is no effort to actually follow them and observe incidence of reinfection."
14264,I remember noticing this in Italy in March.
14265,"Even during the lockdown, there were loads of house parties, including all-day house parties by students."

14295,"People are more aware, even if not everybody is taking it seriously, large groups do wear masks, wash hands, social distance, etc."

14298,Back in March they only tested people with symptoms who'd been to Italy or China.
14299,We were so innocent back then.
14300,Right...what’s a low number?
14301,I agree.

14313,In summer cases were extremely low.
14314,I'm pretty sure that it spreads in school.
14315,"It's just that children are asymptomatic more often, so they probably don't even get tested."
14316,What I don't understand is why they didn't use the summer to prepare schools for this.
14317,Online classes for example.
14318,It is good and bad news I guess.
14319,"Good that the infection rate is lower so not enough people (32) got the virus to de-blind, bad that we don't have an answer to Pfizer/BioNTech's study."

14426,"That is a bit unclear actually, most cases that can be traced happen at private events but most infections can't be traced."
14427,People obviously remember if they were at a birthday party 6 days ago but they will not know if they have been infected in public transport.

14481,Comorbidities can further exacerbate the mortality rate.

14519,There was a lot of bad information on masks in the start of 2020.
14520,"Some old studies were inconclusive on masks, it was unclear if infection came primarily from aerosols or surfaces and the fear was that there would be a shortage of PPE for the hospitals."
14521,One of the old studies used against masks dealt with reducing influenza-infections and it showed that non-medical staff couldn't figure out how to use masks properly.
14522,The data was interpreted badly because you had to adjust for the fact that improper usage also meant _not actually wearing the masks_.

14618,"You lost every single thread you opened, and now you’ve retreated to one last point."
14619,"&gt;Now, the reason why keeping the healthcare system protected is important is not just to reduce the amount that die from covid, it is also so that as few as possible die from other causes as well while the doctors are busy dealing with the virus."
14620,Sure.
14621,And striking the right balance between treating the extraordinary victims of the virus with the ordinary victims is key.
14622,Which Sweden failed at.
14623,A fact supported by four different sources I sent to you.
14624,"If you disagree, then please provide evidence, not just an opinion or a made up reasoning."
14625,Evidence.
14626,Studies.
14627,Expert opinions.
14628,"Send me anything that supports your opinion, please."
14629,Anything at all.
14630,"&gt;The other main argument, again, was the economic one, but I have already proven that the Swedish economy was among the least affected despite the focus on exports."
14631,You have proven nothing.
14632,You’ve claimed something.
14633,"Please provide evidence for your claim that Sweden is among the least affected, taking into account that tourism, not export, has been hit hardest."
14634,Relying on export has been a positive in this crisis.
14635,You keep coming up with random things that are so easily disproven.
14636,You are the definition of a layman wanting to argue details that you understand nothing of.
14637,"I support everything I say with a source, and you’ve given me not a single one."
14638,&gt;These are valid measurements for what can be considered success.
14639,No.
14640,The crisis is about preventing deaths.
14641,Which Sweden has failed at.
14642,You’re just trying to cherrypick the least terrible measures to make Sweden look better.
14643,"&gt;Norway by contrast, is not nearly as good a benchmark as it is completely arbritrary, the only reason you use it is because they handled themselves almost surprisingly well, but that does not make every other country worse."
14644,No.
14645,I’m so fucking tired of you making shit up and then accusing me of doing the same.
14646,I’m using Norway as an example because it is literally the most comparable country in the world to Sweden.
14647,Which I’ve sent you a study done by experts that agree with me.
14648,"&gt;I repeat, Norway doing well does not make every other country worse."
14649,Sure.
14650,"It just makes Sweden a lot worse, since experts agree that if Sweden had done what Norway did, **thousands of deaths could have been avoided, at no cost to the economy."
14651,** This is not just my opinion.
14652,It’s not an argument I’ve thought up.
14653,It is the opinion of epidemic experts around the world.
14654,And what is your counter argument to that overwhelming evidence?
14655,Crickets.
14656,"Just FYI people in Melbourne, for the most part, got $3000 per month to sit at home if they lost their job, it's been pretty damn good (financially) for most."
14657,In fact most people increased their savings over this period because they were spending less.
14658,How about don't comment on a specific countries lockdown if you haven't been in it.
14659,"Well, that would give them a place to go and enjoy their unregulated, Christian/Sharia theocratic oligarchy with no health care, where they can live in Tr#ump-quality housing and go to work at the unregulated coal plants."
14660,"Then when they need treatment for their black lung disease/cancer/covid/diabetes/whatever, they can hold pancake breakfasts to pay for it!"
14661,"See, problem solved."
14662,Hard to say and highly dependent on what group is catching it.
14663,Could be 10x higher or 10x lower if elderly people are a higher/lower part of the 5191 than what would be expected from a random sample.
14664,"Hopefully it’s a higher fraction of young people, as the reporting seems to suggest."
14665,"Because the US Constitution grants an inherent right to freedom of movement, which includes interstate travel."

14669,what exactly are you suggesting?
14670,Right on track.
14671,Sad.
14672,I hate salad bars where they have the sneeze guards over the food.
14673,They are taking away my liberty to sneeze on the food!!!!
14674,It's bad enough I have to wear a shirt and shoes!
14675,Sounds like the curfew is actively making things worse if people are more having sleepovers.

14683,Does everyone live in some different world than I do where their life doesn't normally revolve around working?
14684,"Being told to lockdown for 2 years instead of that would sound like I won the lottery or something, not something I would have to ease into."
14685,"Sure, I missed out on a trip to Europe, but I can do it a better year and can easily occupy myself indefinitely."
14686,"The only easing in that happened was they started by funding it, then they decided they weren't doing anything anymore and let everything expire so people are stuck in messes with reduced hours, lower pay, or no job or unemployment at all."
14687,My pleasure!
14688,That's alot of people in hospital for covid

14700,&gt; Do you honestly expect them to remove the security from airports one day?
14701,I don't expect measures to ever be removed because I don't think the threat will ever be gone.
14702,There are some threats that can't be eliminated because there are people in this world that won't allow that to happen.
14703,"Security measures at airports are definitely no perfect and some of them are pretty asinine but at the same time, getting on a plane with a serious weapon is not all that easy anymore."
14704,So dropping 20-30% of the tests won’t affect the amount cases?
14705,"Oh yes, probably."
14706,"Nicely put, I agree, do not stop what works even if it is all we have for now."

14742,Import-export flows between France and Germany alone are larger than NZ's entire economy IIRC.
14743,"With closed borders, German factories literally risk not being able to keep running because their whole supply chain would face endless logistic disruptions, starting from travel times."

14934,"""Long Covid"" is about as real a medical condition as ""feeling unwell""."
14935,You're handing hypochondriacs a blank slate to invent their own conditions.
14936,Southwest is blocking middle seats.
14937,"I read what you said and it was some baseless, presumptuous bullshit."
14938,When did I ever say or claim that I would “push for or demand blanket restrictions from the government”?
14939,Or that I live in fear?
14940,"Get fucked man, people like you make all of this so much worse."
14941,I have super fair skin...crazy history of sun based skin cancer in my family...I live in So cal.
14942,I am in the sun all the time...I still don’t have high levels of vitamin d.  They are on the low end of acceptable unless I supplement.
14943,People should get checked.
14944,It’s a fat soluble vitamin and that’s where it’s stored iirc.
14945,"It took me about 3 months to get back to normal range vitamin D and iron levels after having extremely bad ovarian cyst ruptures and loss of blood, plus low on like every vitamin."
14946,"I also had to take magnesium, niacin, and B vitamins prescriptions too."
14947,My dose of vitamin  D is now a lot lower.
14948,"comparing with Denmark and Norway as an example, with multiple press briefings a week from politicians trying to instill the importance of following all the new recommentations, I'd say yes it's still sustainable in the sense that people generally know what's expected of them for now and for a long time ahead."
14949,It's about having a baseline of changed behavior and not put all your hope in 2 weeks long changes in bar opening times or going from 2 to 10 to 5 to 20 people allowed in a group.
14950,As an ex swimmer I'm fucking devastated reading this
14951,"There is a shortage of nurses willing to be treated like dirt, not an actual shortage of trained people."
14952,We barely test anyone for reinfections (needs genomic sequencing of the strain to prove a reinfection).
14953,So there might be tons and tons of reinfections that we simply can't prove.
14954,Thank you so much for explaining!
14955,My comment highlighted exactly the part of your comment that I was talking about...
14956,I even said the word twice while pointing out why that word seems unduly optimistic given the data.
14957,"You said the data ""might indicate the beginning of a plateau"", and I pointed out that absolutely *nothing* in the data indicates any sign of a plateau."
14958,"I did not see any previous comment of yours talking about what you expected, so I have no idea what you expected... but I never said anything about what you expected."
14959,I was talking about what you said you saw in the current data.
14960,Nothing more.
14961,You know that this correction was flagged already last week?
14962,While half of the passengers shut their eyes and say it isnt happening...
14963,"Honestly, I do not understand you people."
14964,WE WERE NEVER AGAINST YOU IN ANY WAY!
14965,What happened to comradery and wishing the best for every country?
14966,"Great that Finland is doing good, wonderful - but what are you trying to achieve with these comments?"
14967,[removed]
14968,The videos I’ve seen on PBS show the relative effectiveness of even simple cloth masks.
14969,The profile shots of expectoration are taken in some sort of polarizing light (or something like that) that makes the airborne clouds of particles clear.
14970,You can see that the masks cut down on the distance.
14971,"Now, I still wouldn’t want to be in a room with someone coughing, because as you indicate, the longer you stay in there the more chances of being in contact."
14972,"But simple masks are a helpful option, in that I’d rather have one than not."
14973,Better masks and better availability (along with a mandate) would be... better.
14974,"I agree about the CDC, but considering the political
meddling we shouldn’t be surprised."
14975,"I have acquaintances in government agencies, and the stories I’ve heard of blatant destruction of mounds of records and data -that has taken lifetimes to collect- that contradicts the administration narratives is, in a word, frightening."
14976,Hand in hand with that is suppression of the dissemination of relevant information through tactics of intimidation.

14983,What's there to know.
14984,The government wants to put teachers in danger - something that's already happened in areas with weaker or no unions - and this union isn't having it.
14985,I'm shocked - just shocked - that you post on /r/conservative.
14986,It's almost like you're ideologically opposed to strong unions.
14987,There are times in history where cities instituted some level of quarantine or lockdown.
14988,"Issue is the most prominent of these were during outbreaks of yersinia pestis (most commonly spread by rats and fleas) or cholera (drinking water contamination), so it's not a good way to evaluate the effectiveness one way or the other since human to human spread wasn't the only transmission method."
14989,Edit:  Totally forgot about Spanish Flu.
14990,The results of St. Louis lockdown versus Philadelphia staying open is the most prominent one.
14991,St. Louis had fewer deaths and is generally considered to have recovered faster economically.
14992,"Lots of articles from the time about the economy tanking whether you were open or in lockdown, so there's that."
14993,Never gonna happen.
14994,"Our two biggest provinces , Ontario and Quebec have the same populations as Pennsylvania and Michigan together."
14995,They have vast majority of cases and deaths.
14996,Ontario has 200 cases per million and Quebec has 600 (Same as US overall).
14997,This pandemic is about choices.
14998,"Masks, distancing and isolation are the solution until vaccine in 2-4 months."
14999,"And here in Ecuador, we're in the middle: strict lockdown, gradual lifting, and a rate that doesn't spike or go away."
15000,"ICU is on the brink of collapse, but never worse, as we simmer along with about 800-1000 cases a day."
15001,I just hope we are agile enough to see the next spike coming early enough to respond.
15002,"And, I hope early measures taken swiftly could possible be less harsh."
15003,"&gt; We did not find any relationship between vitamin D
concentrations or vitamin deficiency and the severity of the disease."
15004,We had higher increases before and it’s quite a sweeping argument.
15005,When we had higher increases we tested ten times less and didn’t report four days total after weekends.
15006,It’s an alarming increase but I expected more from you.
15007,You’re usually better at statistics (but maybe not at context).
15008,[removed]
15009,"Your problem is the uncritical deployment of the concept ""lockdown"" rather than the efficacy of the broad range of strategies it describes"
15010,"Yup, I hope my sarcasm came through because you basically got downvoted for quoting the article."
15011,I think the limited immunity is going to be very disappointing for a lot of people and it's going to take some time to accept.
15012,"I know it was hard for me, and I'm a fast adapter."
15013,People will push back against this before they can accept that coronavirus is not the chicken pox.
15014,"It's a nightmare really, until the vaccine becomes close to 100% effective."
15015,I showed them.
15016,I am still observing the first stay at home order.
15017,"Wait, does this mean I could have left my home in the last six months?"
15018,Not that it would matter.

15036,?
15037,"Unsure, but certainly people should be sure they're doing what they can do try to ensure their immune system is functioning at its peak."
15038,"Vitamins C and D, Zinc, Selenium are all important for immune function."
15039,I'm sure some others.
15040,"I mean - there's a difference of having diarrhea, cleaning yourself, going swimming vs. shitting in a pool."
15041,"Reading the above, I have the mental image of people just crapping in the pool even though I know that's not the case."
15042,Your links disprove all of this
15043,Can you help me on the CA numbers?
15044,"I read this paragraph:

&gt;During the interview process, most people were unable to identify where they may have been exposed; however, of those that can identify possible exposure sites, 55% said they attended an event or gathering where two or more people became sick, and 17% said they attended a place of worship where people became sick."
15045,"Over 3,000 people who tested positive for COVID-19 spent time at a retail setting, like a grocery store or other shop."
15046,"Over 1,400 people spent time at outdoor spaces, over 600 people visited restaurants and over 500 people had been in offices."
15047,I'm having trouble finding the specific area talking about 4% being schools though.
15048,Did you calculate this or is it mentioned somewhere else?
15049,I hardly consider what happened in March a lockdown.
15050,At least comparing it to other countries who have done it.
15051,what's the latest as regards to runny nose and covid?
15052,I know they used to say it wasn't really a symptom.
15053,Both me and my boyfriend have one today so wondered if it's the beginning of it.
15054,Slight headache too.
15055,No fever.
15056,"Considering their attitude against the pandemic and masks in general, it's practically impossible to generate any sympathy for these cucks."
15057,"It doesn’t matter, Jesus."
15058,"Even if it was only 15-20% who had it, you’d have still seen a shit ton of re-infections here."
15059,Other states are reporting negative number of cases.
15060,Thinking it's unnecessary is a precursor to not doing it.
15061,"If you think it's necessary, you'll do it (even if some people who think it's unnecessary also do it)."
15062,"So at the very least, it is perfectly reasonable to say that the group **containing** people who refuse to wear masks demonstrates more antisocial tendencies."
15063,"The latest news is that even if we get the shot, we're still masked and distancing until at least 2022...maybe 2023."
15064,Maybe forever.
15065,At least that's what Osterholm and company say.
15066,"No, Niljs Bejerot is not a reptilian alien."
15067,"I'm sorry being wrong makes you so angry, that's very childish."
15068,"The mature thing is to change your mind when you're wrong, not throw a fit and stigmatize the mentally ill, a very marginalized group."
15069,Extremely poor behavior.
15070,"Giesecke *is* pulling strings, did you miss the FHM leaks or just trying to misinform readers."
15071,Saying that a few powerful people influence politics is the least controversial thing ever.
15072,That's the case in every country.
15073,"For example nobody is accusing Russia critics of ""conspiracies""."
15074,We know what happened to those doctors that fell out of windows in Russia.
15075,We know that Sweden's regressive corona policy and constant government misinformation is not only the result of science.
15076,So I'm raising a legitimate question.
15077,What *actually* happened in Sweden.
15078,No.
15079,Nobody said there is not cultural support for mask denial.
15080,"For example a leading social democrat politician forgot about ministerial governance for a second and claimed that ""masks are not part of Swedish culture""."
15081,I think Swedish vanity also explains it.
15082,We don't need everyone to get vaccinated to get it under control.
15083,Hopefully at least 40% of us are smart enough to get it.
15084,"It's amazing how many people don't get the flu vaccine, but the people who do make a huge difference in keeping it under control."
15085,"That's the reason so many can say ""I've never gotten the flu vaccine and I've never gotten the flu""."
15086,You’re comparing apples to oranges here.
15087,"I’m not defending the US response, but Canada has like 9x less the amount of people than the US does."
15088,Definitely gives them an edge in controlling cases on a national level.
15089,"We shouldn’t be saying “look at Canada, that’s why America should wear masks” we should be saying “wow look at all this evidence that proves why we should wear masks”"
15090,Have there really been any 2nd increases yet in any local areas?
15091,"I know on the state levels we've seen it, but I haven't seen any info on specific areas."
15092,What’s the practical difference between this being the third surge of the first wave vs the third wave?
15093,"So frustrating.....on one hand I don't more of my fellow Coloradans to die, while on the other hand, many of us need to work to eat...."
15094,Well.
15095,Everyone agrees that lockdowns are not sustainable.
15096,"They have their use in little bursts with dormant periods in between—like Israel showed

Argentina is failing because people stopped respecting the lockdown"
15097,the long run problem here is that most people are completely against vaccination.
15098,"You can hear numerous arguments like ""new fascism"" or ""companies are trying to control us"" etc."
15099,I think that scientists and experts are very naive thinking that it will just take better education of people here...
15100,I mean Czech people are absolutely completely against it and more rational arguments you have the more resistance you face.

15108,:D
15109,That is very concerning
15110,"&gt; we went over this a few days ago, are you still not on board with the idea that testing matters?"
15111,Of course it matters... but what you are saying is we should compare known numbers (the reported numbers) to the imaginary numbers you invent to account for the difference in testing.
15112,"Yes, there were twice as many tests in the week of June 24 (the previous high) but we have no way of knowing what the real number might be."
15113,"For all we know, they tested everyone that was actually infected and thus the reported number *is* the real number."
15114,"Likewise, for all we know, despite testing twice as many people last week, they might not have tested anywhere near the total number of people that are actually infected."
15115,"In fact we can assume that it is not, because obviously there are infected people spreading the virus to other people unknowingly (I would hope)."
15116,"So, in the end, all we can do is compare the reported numbers."
15117,"&gt; Feels like this is common knowledge by now, but for some reason you like to make things seem in their worst possible way."
15118,"No, I try to stick to the facts."
15119,The facts are that there are more **reported** cases now than at any time before.
15120,Anything else is just a guess.
15121,One other thing... the positive rate for week 26 (the week containing the previous single day high) was 10.18% - The positive rate for week 42 was 3.86% - that's not such a big difference.

15126,Are you ignoring again the second parallel statistic I told you about?
15127,"I know you are not this ignorant, you have been reading these threads for months."
15128,"But just to satisfy your desire :

FHM statistic counts everyone that dies within 30 days of being confirmed as positive of COVID-19 (""recently positive"")."
15129,It also makes checks against the death registry to ensure that.
15130,This means if you were recently positive and got hit by a car - you are counted in.
15131,"If you are recently positive but with stage IV terminal cancer and die now, you are counted in."
15132,If you are recently positive and have any unrelated condition that results in your deaths - in or out of the hospital - you are counted in.
15133,"If you are untested and die of COVID-19, you are not counted in this statistic and also if you are tested but die more than a month after you last positive test."
15134,"Keep in mind, people in hospital are tested more than once too?"
15135,Socialstyrelsen statistic counts everyone that has in their death certificate COVID-19 as main or secondary cause of death or as contributing factor.
15136,This also includes people that were diagnosed with COVID-19 by a doctor but not tested.
15137,"However, they exclude people that died of other causes while being COVID-19 positive - so the example with the cancer patient or the traffic accident will be removed here."
15138,"You can find the data here: [https://www.socialstyrelsen.se/statistik-och-data/statistik/statistik-om-covid-19/statistik-over-antal-avlidna-i-covid-19/](https://www.socialstyrelsen.se/statistik-och-data/statistik/statistik-om-covid-19/statistik-over-antal-avlidna-i-covid-19/) ; 90% of the cases found in this statistic had test results from FHM, so the two statistics largely overlap."
15139,"Edit: also, people refer to the statistics of Sweden because it is one of the few countries where the excess deaths from all causes collaborate the officially reported COVID-19 death numbers."
15140,You can find these here: [https://www.scb.se/en/About-us/news-and-press-releases/statistics-sweden-to-publish-preliminary-statistics-on-deaths-in-sweden/](https://www.scb.se/en/About-us/news-and-press-releases/statistics-sweden-to-publish-preliminary-statistics-on-deaths-in-sweden/)

15181,Trump could have used the virus to pummel China.
15182,He could have blamed them for the entire global pandemic.
15183,"Imagine this simple Trump speech: 

""China knew they had a new virus but they kept it hidden, they could have limited travel in and out of the country but instead they lied and kept it hidden."

15216,"Again...I'm merely conveying an argument I heard, not weighing in on its value."
15217,Then Covid is an indirect cause of death.
15218,Look at the battle of Stalingrad from WWII.
15219,Tens of thousands of civilians died from starvation and illness since they couldn’t leave the city.
15220,We include those deaths in the total for the battle since they were an indirect result of the battle.
15221,yeah right
15222,Ikr?
15223,There were a bunch of great books like Garrett’s “The Coming Plague” and Preston’s “The Hot Zone” on bestseller lists ***back in the 90s*** warning us all about this.

15229,Is it not sustainable anymore?
15230,"Yes, and I remember, though not the exact number, that people with Covid were a majority of those in ICU."
15231,Some though weren't there exactly for complications of covid but rather were admitted for something else and then diagnosed positive.
15232,But I also remember that ICU places weren't full nationwide at any point so it is quite possible indeed there were a 1000 or more of them

15302,I now have all the symptoms the subject of this article talks about.

15324,"For what it's worth, I agree that she has the ""experience"" to be a supreme court judge."
15325,"If I wanted to be snooty, I could even say that her credentials are below average."
15326,"I wouldn't because I fundamentally disagree with the credentialism that's led most supreme court justices in recent history to be chosen from Harvard or Yale, but that's an entirely different argument."
15327,&gt;The science shows children are extremely low risk.
15328,"In fact, they have a higher risk of dying of the flu and more children die of the flu in 3 months every year than have died of coronavirus since the pandemic began 7 months ago."
15329,There's no reason we can't get kids back in school in some capacity with proper precautions and controls.
15330,"Yes, from everything I've read, that's correct."
15331,Children are much less likely to die from coronavirus than practically any other group.
15332,I do have a few issues with this line of thinking though.
15333,1) What about Covid's long term health affects?
15334,"I'm not a virologist, and I didn't study a science, much less medicine."
15335,"I'm not going to pretend that I know much other than what I've read in news articles which aren't exactly the most reliable source, but it sounds like a significant proportion of people who get covid have longterm side-effects ranging from breathing difficulties to mental slowing."
15336,"Even if the risk of death is low, these long-term effects need to be considered."
15337,2) You're completely ignoring the teachers &amp; their families.
15338,3) If a school is underserved then they're less likely to have proper precautions and controls to mitigate the risks.
15339,4) The families of these children are at higher risk themselves.
15340,"Even if the students don't die, one bad outbreak at a school could mean dozens of high risk people getting infected."
15341,"And again, if a school is underserved then it's likely not getting the best anti-Covid equipment as is."
15342,I hear what you're saying.
15343,"I went to a high school where 1/3rd of my class didn't graduate, and that was during the Obama years."
15344,I'm certain teachers there don't have proper protection right now.
15345,"So I'm very aware of the issues that you're bringing up because I've seen families who don't have internet, kids who are shuffled around from family member to family member, and who don't have parental figures who make them go to school."
15346,"I'm not fine with leaving them behind, but I am concerned for the teachers as well."
15347,It's wrong to tell them to risk their lives when the government doesn't give a shit about them or the kids.
15348,"After all, if the government cared, then something would've been done months ago."
15349,Or they'd be passing another stimulus bill right now with provisions to ensure everyone has internet access.
15350,Or they'd be doing anything but putting Amy Coney Barrett on the court.
15351,"If you want to blame someone, blame elected officials."
15352,They could do something.
15353,"Pelosi, McConnell, and Trump could've gotten together and said ""Look, there's a lot of teachers and students who are at risk."
15354,"We can follow the science, find what's best, and ensure that everyone is as protected as they can be."""
15355,But that's not what happened because they're all bloodsucking ghouls.
15356,They're the reason I'm so supportive of unions - because unions are the only way for the average person to exercise any power in our society.
15357,I'm sure Lori Lightfoot is going to bend on some issues.
15358,Imagine if this was nationwide.
15359,"Imagine if there was a nationwide teachers strike right now demanding proper protection, assured internet access for students, and meals too."
15360,I bet you they'd be acting right now.
15361,"Instead, there's no pressure on them, so they won't."
15362,We truly are in this together.
15363,Is that a typo?
15364,100iu is very little.
15365,The lifeguards are trying their best but they’re a bit overwhelmed with the vast volumes of people drowning in shit.
15366,Apparently drowning in shit news is bad for the pool’s concession sales.
15367,The pool admins have been blaming the lifeguards for reporting drownings or for blowing their whistle to warn of dangerous conditions.
15368,"Also, the pool patrons have made death threats against the pool cleaner for advising temporary closure of the pool for cleaning and for measuring the escalating coliform count of the pool."
15369,Apparently some pool admins think if we didn’t measure the amount of shit in the pool then it wouldn’t be there.
15370,Ignorance is bliss till you drown in the shit you’ve been spewing.
15371,&gt; 600% is a standard (one tiny gelcap’ worth) dosage for supplements.
15372,Eight times that much a day for months may lead to toxicity.
15373,"It is not only about toxicity, though."
15374,There can be adverse effects even before we reach the level of outright toxicity.
15375,"I’m all for this, but they have to make these tests free or mandatory to be covered by insurance."
15376,My insurance will only cover tests if you have symptoms so if you’re getting a test for travel purposes it’s $160 a test.
15377,This feels like just another restriction that only heavily effects or prohibits the poor.

15386,They've shown otherwise.
15387,Kids might not get sick as often but they can spread.
15388,This is an absolutely ridiculous argument.

15394,"Greatly improved understanding of virology, decades of preliminary research on SARS and MERS, and the fact that its a respiratory virus thats spreading very quickly across the globe."
15395,"Compare it to the last headline worthy epidemic, ebola, which was limited to a small region of the world for the most part, and is spread orofecally."
15396,It's pretty simple.
15397,Trump is saying that the reason why we have more positive cases now is because we're testing more.
15398,The data shows that the infection *rate* has been largely static since the beginning (3-5%).
15399,So in the beginning if we only tested 100 symptomatic people we'd expect to see 3-5 positive tests for COVID.
15400,"Now that covid is everywhere (again, wholly because of Trump and his leadership) he's saying we have more cases because now we're testing tens of thousands of people a day, meaning we're seeing thousands of positive cases."
15401,"Trump also, erroneously, points to the CDC IFR data which most recently states that the survival rate for anyone under 70 is essentially a guarantee and you're more likely to die due to a car wreck if you're in the working class (less than 70 years old) than from covid."
15402,We need to combat this narrative at all costs
15403,Lol came for this one
15404,They call that vocal minority.
15405,They are everywhere spreading their misery.
15406,From news articles comments to YouTube video comments to calling into radio shows to counter protesting protests for human rights.
15407,Does anyone know if kids under 10 in schools in Europe are required to wear masks outside at recess?
15408,"Seriously, the government never seems to want to deal with reality, regardless of party or level."
15409,"We knew there would be a spike in cases in the fall, why didn't they invest shitloads of money into the testing infrastructure?"
15410,It's the same bullshit in Canada too.
15411,"If we conducted mass testing, much more people would self isolate after positive tests and the virus would slow down massively."
15412,All that money spent on testing would be saved with less money spent on patient care.
15413,I think part of it is sensationalism in journalism.
15414,"Someone will more likely read an article that says immunity is falling fast, when all the scientist are saying are antibodies are declining (as they all they do) during an infection."
15415,Journalist take these statements or studies and turn them into something sensational.
15416,"There was a recent study from the University of Arizona that's called Let's Stick to the Known Knowns, that I think has a decent take on immunity."
15417,"But more so, the name of their study, I think was a jab at the sensationalism on immunity."
15418,"More testing 

Better protocols

Hospitals not overloaded ( except that is changing )"

15440,The study is progressing more slowly than ... originally expected.

15442,"But that first analysis will come when there have been a total of only 32 cases of COVID-19 across the company's entire 42,000 volunteer study."
15443,It would be considered positive if six or fewer of those 32 cases occurred in the group that received the vaccine.

15476,"If by that point, we're still a long way from the average person getting the vax, social distancing at least will end for the vast majority of the population and the epidemological end will arrive, but with more pain in the interim."

15482,The big kicker to it is that some testing centers are testing at 40-45 cycles.
15483,Meaning that its catching positives  thats already dead viral cells or such small amounts that its not possible to spread.
15484,So begins the question of what % of these positive tests are at the greater than 32 cycle count as they are essentially meaningless numbers?

The problem with restrictions in Poland was that they were cherry-picked and not science based."

15715,"For us they are saying the surge is because of household gatherings which IMO have not changed at all since summer, if they have they have decreased and not increased."
15716,Obvious people aren’t wearing masks at home because of no requirements which fits the bill.

15771,"A larger, more detailed study would be needed, of course, when the pandemic is over."
15772,SARS-1 was contained before it became a pandemic in 2003.

16264,And I know during that initial phase I also didn't go outside as much as I normally would just because most of the stuff there would normally be to do was closed.

16422,"might just wanna ask, ideally should be between 30ng/mL - 60(ish)ng/mL (low to highest)

16436,Don't prevent disabled people from getting on the elevator like some bouncer.

16488,You were allowed to exercise with one other person but there were no restrictions on who that person was.

16494,&gt;A growing number of officials from across party lines are calling for a nationwide mask mandate.
16495,"If only there were something simple and obvious the feds could do to make it stick... Oh, wait, I know: Tell the states that their next round of stimulus money is tied to the mask compliance rate in their state."
16496,"For every percentage point below 95% compliance, you lose 5% of the stimulus money you were allocated."
16497,"If your state has 75% or less compliance, better luck next time, but you get nothing this round."
16498,"Its not female leaders, but leaders with nice hair."

16527,You think there’s no risk?
16528,Okay.
16529,I’m a physician and have seen many under 30’s with “no risk” die or have long term complications.
16530,"Also, we are seeing more and more people come in months after apparently having Covid (many who were asymptomatic), who we end up doing chest CT’s to assess for PE, etc and are finding long term damage (pulmonary fibrosis as well as damage to other organ systems)."
16531,"Of course, this is anecdotal so not all that meaningful right now, but I can promise there will be studies released on some of the long term effects over the next year (I personally know of at least 4 ongoing ones, one of which I am directly involved in)."
16532,All this to say you’re simply being willfully ignorant because you don’t like reality.
16533,"Also, everything you’ve said is selfish as hell."
16534,There’s no other way to describe it.
16535,You’ve literally put seeing a baseball game as more important than 1/100 lives.

16543,"Doesn't mean anything, just sharing my perspective."
16544,Because they didn't close their borders and didn't start mass testing early like Norway did.
16545,They also didn't properly isolate elderly care homes.
16546,Norway closed schools for a couple weeks as well but I'm not sure how much of an impact that had - the local scientific committee was openly against it.
16547,Afaik immigrant communities in Stockholm also got hit disproportionately hard.
16548,The only thing they did was set a precedent for more lockdowns.

16562,"I guess the two questions are if the rate in the general population is 80%, and if covid affects vitamin D levels or if people who are deficient in the hospital were deficient before they got sick."
16563,Not a scientist but I think the research is consistently showing that vitamin D actually is indeed somewhat protective.

16594,The only person I'm connected to that's died from it was my friend's 94 year old grandpa who also had stage 4 cancer.
16595,"&amp;#x200B;

I'm not minimizing its severity at all because it's clearly killed hundreds of thousands and has left a lot of people with lasting symptoms."
16596,But not nearly everyone has had a dramatic personal experience with Covid
16597,So many rural people just don't believe they're at risk.
16598,"I live in a mostly rural county, although my area is considered an exurb of a huge city."
16599,So the people here who spend more time in the city and suburbs are way more diligent about taking precautions.
16600,"The farther away from the city you go, the less likely people are to take precautions."
16601,"In the small towns in the rural part of the county, masks are very rarely worn and crowd events are happening as normal."
16602,"Church services, in-person school, high school football, homecoming events, tailgating, weekend farmer's markets, fall festivals, church bazaars, parades, dine-in restaurants, pumpkin patches, retail shops, and now Halloween events last weekend and this coming weekend."
16603,Thanksgiving and Christmas events are planned for the next several weekends.
16604,"All with full crowds, no social distancing, and no masks."
16605,We have 20 hospital beds and 0 ICU beds in the county.

16613,"What I'm saying is that the data suggests that while very good masks might protect a user well, use of masks by everyone in the room will protect a user better."
16614,"Statistics have edge cases, we all know that."
16615,"If you can use an N95 + surgical mask whenever you are around other people, great."
16616,"But many, many people can't, for various reasons."
16617,"However a similar or even superior protection can be achieved by having everyone wear masks, even those of lower quality than N95."
16618,"It may be counterintuitive, but if you think about the physics of aerosol viral communication, it makes sense doesn't it?"
16619,Reduction at the sources is far more effective than trying to filter out multiple viral intakes consistently.

16671,"They've fucked up everything else, why not this too?"
16672,"Fauci has also admitted he said 2022 because he doesn't think there's any hope of Americans being responsible for that long, regardless of the state of the pandemic."

16741,"Being anti-social isn't ""enlightened self interest""."
16742,Impulsive behavior and risk-taking are actually correlated with anti-social traits.

16752,They wouldn't do that unless they put the country into lockdown again.

16758,Even though getting that stimulus would help the president win reelection.
16759,They put politics aside and pushed to help the American people.
16760,One party is responsible for the lack of stimulus.

16762,"The recent surge is not due to the breaking of rules, that's ridiculous."
16763,The entire region had completely opened for business when the numbers went down in the summer and they've been very reluctant to impose new restrictions because of the economic impact.
16764,"The US, and Trump specifically, have made a mess of the response, but let's not try to rationalize away the cause of the current situation in Europe."
16765,"That would still be done, just with government approval against certain groups (ie."

16769,"Like I explained in another reply, it’s not very practical as it sounds in theory to take a gap year."
16770,"When you take a gap year it’s usually to build up funds  for school or work experience, or to go traveling."
16771,"It’s really hard to find work in most cases as a college student, especially one that would pay decently, and finding a job relevant to your field to build experience is also hard to find."
16772,"You can’t travel either, at least not to foreign countries like most gap-year college backpackers would want to do."
16773,"You can’t just take a gap year and spend the entire time doing nothing, which would likely happen to a lot of students."
16774,"Also if you’re in my case, you’ve already taken a gap year and can’t really justify doing another one."
16775,Also I’ve heard of cases where programs told their students that if they take a gap year they’re not guaranteed a spot back in the fall of 2021.
16776,"Probably because they can’t afford to lose anymore money, it’s shitty but I’ve heard of it happening."

16807,"&gt;	The two women were requested to wear masks and use hand sanitiser to help mitigate the spread of the coronavirus, but they refused and began to film the security guard on a phone when he asked them to leave."
16808,"&gt;An altercation began, with the guard attempting to grab the phone, when he was struck by a garbage can."
16809,The two women then began to punch him.
16810,"So apparently they refused to put on masks, then began filming the guard."
16811,Did it become physical when he tried to grab their phone from them?
16812,"The title of the article makes it sound like they stabbed him for telling them to put on masks, but the article makes it sound like they stabbed him because he tried to grab their phone instead of letting them film him."
16813,"I've read that in countries that don't allow randos to run around with guns, that even though there are more knife attacks than we have, the victims often survive."

16824,Read the comments carefully if you miss points that I made extremely clear.
16825,No.
16826,The point was that *lockdowns don't work*.
16827,Oh look at Spain.
16828,Spaniards are so silly.
16829,Don't they see that their lockdowns don't work.
16830,People keep dying.
16831,The Swedish strategy is scientific and sustainable.
16832,"Then Sweden wants lockdowns but rebrands them to ""recommendations""."
16833,So it seems that *staying inside* is very effective.
16834,We just recommended it 7 months late.
16835,Sad those people had to die.
16836,"We could have used ~~lockdowns~~ ""recommendations"" to ~~stay inside~~ ""avoid public transit, areas like malls and physical contact"" in March."

16839,It's not just rural America.
16840,"Residents in more populous states like California, Texas, Florida, and New York are moving into rural areas to ""beat"" COVID."
16841,They refuse to wear masks and generally condescend the original residents while receiving healthcare that no one else in the state can.
16842,Those states are not forbidding their residents from leaving the state.

16881,"The issue goes to *credibility*: having seen this massive, obvious flaw, it is right to question the credibility of the researchers themselves."
16882,"It does NOT invalidate the data, but I do not have that data and therefore cannot comment."
16883,"It also does NOT mean that the conclusion they drew is wrong - the conclusion drawn could be completely correct, but it is *unwarranted* by the set of data they used."
16884,"Even if the conclusion is correct, *this study* does not warrant it."
16885,"And as to the egregiousness of the error, no, I have not overstated it."
16886,I am not a professional scientist and I instantly saw it.
16887,"I’ll give them credit for not being morons and assume that both both they *and* any peer reviewers saw this error - it is massive and central to the study, and exactly what peer reviewers are looking for."
16888,"Accepting those assumptions, the conclusion is that they were fully aware of the “error” and chose to make it ... which brings us back to credibility, as it indicates intentional bias."
16889,"Again, that doesn’t mean the conclusion is wrong - only that *this study* is not legitimate support for it."
16890,"Bad science is bad science, even when you like the conclusion."

16904,"One gets a coughing fit (not so bad with surgical mask, but still gets one) other got some kind of asthmatic attack if she did anything slightly more active."
16905,They are both athletic and are used to being active.
16906,The one that gets asthma attack is the one probably suffering from covid long term.
16907,She got it at an international competition (severe respitory infection with longer than normal incubation period) and never really recovered.
16908,"We are talking about someone who competed in 2 sports before getting sick, now she can't focus and can't breath in practice if she uses a mask while getting to practice (public transport)."

16916,I stand by the door now and don't let people on with me if they are a moron
16917,Over a week and a half ago two of our family members (who rent a room from us) started exhibiting symptoms.
16918,They initially tested negative (which we now believe to be a false negative) and the tested positive at the beginning of last week.
16919,"We’ve been in strict isolation since, them to their bedroom as my husband, myself and our newborn did not have symptoms."
16920,On Friday my husband started exhibiting symptoms and had a fever Saturday through yesterday evening.
16921,We all got retested Sunday and so far everyone has tested positive but me.
16922,I’m still negative and the mild symptoms I’ve been experiencing can also be attributed to the weather changes and wildfire smoke.
16923,(Thankfully the baby has no symptoms as well).
16924,There’s a possibility I had it back in January - my whole workplace was super duper sick with the flu.
16925,"Fevers lasting a week, we all had chest congestion for a month+ after we “recovered” but only half of us (myself included) tested positive for the flu."
16926,But I’m thinking we possibly had Covid as well?
16927,It would make sense why I’ve been exposed for over a week and neither the baby or I have gotten sick (I was pregnant at the time).
16928,Has anyone else had someone in their household consistently test negative while the rest were positive?
16929,How long can I reasonably wait before I can assume I’m not getting it?
16930,"My first exposure would have bee friday 10/16, with consistent exposure since."
16931,"We gotta get out of the first wave first, then we get to experience the second one"
16932,"Agree, not perfect, but would still be interesting."
16933,I could honestly see them banning airlines from testing before i could see them doing this.
16934,"Yes, our answer to the coronavirus was basically the same as that to the bubonic plague - repent our sins (those phantasmagoric student parties) and show repentance (e.g."
16935,"by wearing a mask *outdoors*, where it is absolutely useless) and maybe the divine scourge will avoid us!"
16936,"700 years later and we have not learnt anything, *sigh*."

16974,"We've always wondered how it would be that the East seemed to always be the primary culture and control in Futuristic fiction, and now we've got our answer: it wasn't War or economic choices that made the West fall, it was the lack of care for each other and failure to wear masks during a plague."
16975,Eastern countries will have their economies roaring while the West sputters and stalls.
16976,"I don't think you're getting my point

An endorsement from the US for human rights would've been completely OK by your books

Yet you dismiss Saudi Arabia's for being an oppressive nation when SA is a critical ally of the US

It's almost like you're starting to see that these accusations are, apart from being **baseless** and manufactured, also *hypocritical*

Nevertheless, that's besides the point."
16977,You asked for proof that China has the majority of support from nations worldwide.
16978,I provided it.
16979,"I think they have not opened their indoor dining at all, which could explain it."
16980,That wasn't even this vaccine.
16981,That was Oxford's.
16982,Pfizer's had zero issues and has even expanded it's trials much larger than initially planned
16983,I have no doubt it will be less than Spanish Flu or that developing countries with younger populations will record fewer deaths per capita.
16984,That still doesn't justify letting people die in the countries that have older populations in my mind or letting people get otherwise preventable damage for my ethical code.
16985,Your ethical code is clearly different and there's no use arguing with that.
16986,"As for the chart, it literally just shows deaths per millions and a trend line."
16987,How does that account for advancements?
16988,"If it did, it would show an estimate of deaths without hospitals and medication."
16989,"It's all ultimately educated speculation, so you're free to draw your own conclusions, but it seems weird to use that chart to say it's not bad when the trend line clearly shows less deaths with more advancement."
16990,"My argument is that without the ability to consistently treat people, it would look worse."
16991,[removed]
16992,"So it seems from the article that most antibodies were gone after 3 months, and that it really depended on the severity of the infection."
16993,Yeah I agree it's good news.
16994,"If it weren't, showers would be very weird."
16995,"It is likely that many people get the virus and have mild, or no symptoms."
16996,"I have no idea of the percentage, but say 50% for arguements sake."
16997,"You test 1000 peple, all with symptoms, and you get 300 cases."
16998,"You test 10000 asymptomatic people, and get another 300 cases - and suddenly the media are up in arms ""Cases double overnight"" and it looks bad for politicians."
16999,The reverse is also partly true.
17000,"Europe, in the first wave, only had enough tests so that symptomatic people were prioritised."
17001,"So the % death toll looks far higher in proportion (you had 300 cases, and 18 people died -  6% fatality rate - media up in arms)"
17002,"Oh wow that’s amazing, if you can find the study would you mind sharing?"

17009,Not to be argumentative but this position only tells part of the story.
17010,Nobody says a state or country should lockdown until the virus goes away.
17011,"Lockdowns do not work unless everybody is doing it, and it is used in concert with effective testing and tracing, in addition to good social distancing/mask usage."
17012,Many things have to be done in concert.
17013,"This means a shorter lockdown, less expenditure by the government on stimulus packages, and quickly reopening the economy while, most importantly, reducing the number of people who die."
17014,The argument against a lockdown seems a disingenuous effort by government to convince people to choose money over lives because government screwed up the initial response.
17015,"It's like telling the jogger, who ate 3 pizzas a day and smoked a pack, that exercise doesn't help so why do it?"

17074,There has been a lot of misinformation on French TV from a variety of sources.
17075,- We wont have a second wave as severe as the first.
17076,- Cases arent important as hospitalizations and deaths arent rising.
17077,- We will be able to control the spread of the virus with more precise and less severe measures than in March.
17078,As far as I can see there was a policy in the past number of months to screen experts appearing on TV to ensure their view never contradicted government aspirations.

17102,I renewed last week online and realized that the fact that I hadn't gotten pulled over for that (in my area you d get a warning at first but the one time I did it late like that I got it twice...) is because DMV had extended grace period til November 1st.

17148,"My doctor recommended 5000iu just generally, not because i was deficient before."

17171,"The entries, each appended with a detailed list of the stops the patient had made, in sparse, sterile language, read like a ship’s logbook."
17172,"“08:00 left home (on foot) / mask worn,” began one entry for Mapo’s fourth patient, dated from March 6th to 10th."
17173,The post went on to note each bus and subway transfer (“Bus transfer to no.
17174,"7730 in front of Sangam High School → disembarked at Susaeggyo / mask worn”), as well as a six-minute stop at a local supermarket, before ending with “15:00 tested positive → 19:00 transferred to Seoul Medical Center.” Emergency text alerts, because of their character limit, linked recipients to these entries rather than relaying them in full."
17175,"“For the text alerts, we use something called a ‘remote broadcasting apparatus,’ ” Song said."
17176,"“Then it’s sent to every phone in a five-kilometre radius through a nearby base station.”

17181,I meant that those were all examples of incorrect predictions from the past few months.
17182,Everyone of those statements was aired on TV or papers or both.
17183,I heard each one repeated colleagues and family as fact for weeks and months on end.

17185,You can thank the hooligans and the radical feminists flooding our streets with protests.
17186,"About 50% of Poles from my own observations walking around town do NOT wear masks properly (below their nose, or even just on their chin)."

When you have a mask on, you're supposed to avoid touching it as much as possible so as not to potentially transfer germs onto the mask."
17203,If you're out running a bunch of errands it's safer to just leave it on your face rather than taking it on and off and on and off.
17204,It's ridiculous.
17205,I ordered a ton of KF94s and been distributing to my friends.
17206,"Several declined because ""they have some homemade masks""."
17207,A KF94 is literally $2!
17208,I think both look pretty decent - I’d be tempted to lean towards Oxford’s as it’s being produced on a non-for-profit basis.
17209,Unsure if Pfizer is the same but guessing not?
17210,I suppose you're right about that.
17211,I am not taking into account politics and race.
17212,"I said I thought it was a bad thing to hope for the virus to spread to anyone, and I won't apologize for that."
17213,As someone from Melbourne the success comes from a vaccine from here.
17214,If we live out a year with a small number of infections like the rest of the country and find an effective vaccine then excellent but obviously if one is never found then it’s trouble.
17215,Then again many countries are relying on this so it’s not as if we are alone.

17227,"In Italy it's different, the post is talking about covid in Italy"
17228,The policy at the hospital my husband works at is that an asymptomatic employee who's been exposed to Covid must work their shifts until they start showing symptoms or test positive.
17229,"Otherwise, half the staff would constantly be in quarantine and they couldn't operate."
17230,It is messed up though.
17231,Is the death rate lower in the United States (compared to earlier this year) due to better treatment or because hospitals have not hit capacity?
17232,well planned by king (though elected in democratic  election) of Poland - sir Kaczynski.
17233,"I've not been outside during lunch time last two weeks, but before then during the lunch all restaurants were packed."
17234,"Packed like there's no pandemic, with very close seating, no barriers, no masks inside while eating, etc."
17235,"This past Sunday late afternoon restaurants were very much full capacity, no distancing, etc."
17236,"Like, sure you have your mask on on the street, in public transport, while shopping... and then you just go eat out and spend 2 hours in close proximity to other people in a packed restaurant."
17237,WTF?!
17238,Since I moved to France a month ago I've eaten out exactly once - I had a long day running errands around town and dropped in a sandwich shop for 10 minutes to have a quick bite.
17239,"That's it, everything else has been home-made or delivered."
17240,"All the local should just give up their traditional eating out regularly - either during work lunch or after work - for a month, and that will help the situation (IMO)."

17248,You’re thinking of just the US trial perhaps?
17249,They’ve also been going quite a bit longer as started earlier and had MERS vaccine as their basis.
17250,"I hear you, but the Oxford vaccine in particular is quite attractive."
17251,"The basis for the vaccine had been in development for years, and passed some form of safety trials, right?"
17252,"Some of the others I would want to see scientists and their reactions, and same with Oxford, but it appears as the likely safest candidate right now."
17253,Why will the second wave not be as severe as the first if daily new cases are breaking records?
17254,"I know deaths are continuously low since March, but what prevents hospitals from overcapacity later in the Winter?"

17283,"""We are so superior that we need to do none of the stuff they did yet will achieve better result!"""

17285,"I said both sides are guilty of for decades being more interested in expanding and consolidating power than serving the people, and that's the truth."
17286,This epidemic is very interesting because seeing people with masks outside is good.
17287,People are being safe around each other.
17288,"Even outside where it's ""safest""."
17289,But it also gives you a sense of how serious the community is taking the virus in general.
17290,Hopefully in indoor areas around town and in their personal lives.
17291,"So if you're in a town where no one even cares to wear a mask outside around others (outside being one of the more lower priority areas to mask up BUT STILL IMPORTANT), you can imagine what it's like indoors or in bars, restaurants, etc."
17292,People who do not take into consideration other people's lives when considering their own actions found to be anti-social.
17293,We'll do an in-depth report later this evening.

17295,"Apparently, the curfew was effective to curb the epidemic in Guyane in July."
17296,But we're talking about a different climate compared with mainland France.
17297,won't be $5.
17298,You'll have to upgrade options.
17299,The base price may be $5 but that will be for the test that goes all the way into your sinuses.
17300,for an extra $20 you can get the rapid test where they only swab your nose.
17301,and for our diamond club members you can do the saliva test.
17302,I manage a small grocery store that sells a ton of specialty food that is hard to find elsewhere.
17303,If someone comes into my store without a mask I'll stop them and offer them a single use one.
17304,If they refuse they get the boot and are permanently banned.
17305,You'd be surprised how many change their tune when they are no longer able to get their supplies.
17306,You could also present a negative within 24 hours.
17307,Not perfect but mitigating nonetheless.
17308,"As a teacher, I am very worried."
17309,"But of course, will keep on doing my job, with mask and face shield."
17310,Stay safe you all.
17311,Studies use the incredibly strict criteria because it's not scientific otherwise.

17319,"I'd guess that lockdowns are probably ""successful"" everywhere they are used in so far as they *slow the rate of spread*."
17320,The difference is what can actually be achieved in terms of eradication vs suppression.
17321,I'd guess that difference is almost entirely based on the amount of community spread at the onset of the policy.
17322,Your question is definitely an important one and I agree that it still seems taboo to discuss.
17323,If your goal was solely to suppress the virus by any means necessary we probably wouldn't be debating the usefulness of lockdowns.
17324,Obviously that is only one of an unlimited number of variables to consider when determining policy.
17325,What will be most interesting is looking back on the strategies countries used 5 or 10 years from now.
17326,I don't think we will know what the right decision was for a long time.
17327,I think that by the end of this pandemic we will see a level field of performance.

17347,This is NOT a both sides are equally bad issue.
17348,A bridge was collapsing in my town so I asked a sound engineer his thoughts.
17349,"Rural hospitals often have single-digit ICU beds, with a majority already used in ""normal"" times, because it would be a waste of money to have 40 ICU beds in a hospital with 5 ICU patients."
17350,"So when a hospital with 9 ICU beds ""overflows"" because they had 5 normal patients and 4 COVID patients, they transfer patients to the nearby metropolitan hospital with more beds."
17351,"Excess deaths are not occuring, so why is this such a cause for alarm?"
17352,"Another common thing we hear is ""ICU at 90% capacity"" with no breakdown of the patient numbers."
17353,"The headline implies that an 11% surge in COVID cases will overwhelm the hospital, but if the hospital has 20 beds with 16 used and 2 used by COVID patients, they can actually handle a 100% surge in COVID patients."
17354,"Here's a good write-up from /u/grignardsreagent:

&gt;As background, I am an emergency room worker in Las Vegas who has over four years of experience."
17355,"&gt;
&gt;When cases ""spike"" the media loves to exaggerate this by posting headlines stating how **ICUs are at full capacity reeeee**."
17356,"My experience is anecdotal, but I will explain how the media makes it seems like people are dropping like flies when in reality they are not."
17357,"&gt;
&gt;One thing to keep in mind is that hospitals are generally owned by corporations whose purpose is to turn a profit."
17358,These institutions are \*generally\* not designed for worst-case scenarios.
17359,"Instead, they are designed to accommodate best-case scenarios for their pocketbooks."
17360,What I mean to say is that building massive ICUs would ultimately be financially unwise from a corporatist's perspective.
17361,Why spend extra money when you can just hold ICU patients in the emergency room (if ICUs were at full capacity) until a bed becomes available on the floor?
17362,"From a money perspective, it is a win-win, and this is something they do all of the time if it is say a bad flu season or an atypical week."
17363,"&gt;
&gt;At my hospital, it is not uncommon for our ICU to reach capacity."
17364,"The big wigs want to work staff as little staff as possible, and they keep nurses on call just in case."
17365,"Again, if there is a bad flu season or patient volume has increased inexplicably they will simply hire travel nurses to fill the needed roles."
17366,"&gt;
&gt;Ultimately, it does not take very much for an ICU to reach full-capacity at many hospitals, and the media deceives the public and fear mongers by writing these headlines."
17367,Where were the headlines when our ICUs reached full capacity hundreds of times before COVID existed?
17368,Exactly.
17369,"&gt;
&gt;I am not saying that ICUs reaching full capacity is not meaningful; it just that it is not nearly as bad as the media would have you believe."
17370,It's not like we have a hundred beds on standby and they are all chock-full.
17371,"In my hospital, it would mean an extra three beds are occupied, and boohoo the intensivist has to stay the full-shift maybe instead of going home early to sleep."
17372,I'm shocked
17373,I was speaking rhetorically.
17374,and you thought the wait was long at security last thanksgiving...
17375,hopes and prayers
17376,Seems like nothing works.
17377,We had 26k in a day last week but we'll probably have another spike like that again soon but bigger.
17378,Seems to be the trend.
17379,"Edited to add:
If you google ""covid uk cases"" a big interactive graph comes up where you can look at the cases and deaths of every single day since the beginning."
17380,And you can look at any country too on a drop-down menu.

17385,"Republicans are a national health problem, actively lying and misrepresenting the pandemic and it's killing people.... Unreal."
17386,Technically you're wrong because we aren't doubling cases every five days.
17387,"Right now it's considered linear, but we're headed towards exponential growth."
17388,"It's really not an important distinction, bc we're fucked as we careen towards completely losing control."
17389,"Yeah that was always a BS answer, they said it was for cleaning and stocking but they're doing all of their stocking during the day when it's packed."
17390,What if you test positive after arriving at the airport?

17393,LMFAO dude you are blitzed.
17394,Summer 2021 masks are gone and restriction are lifted
17395,I thought efficacy has to be determined by severity of disease in the real world?
17396,"All these vaccines have already proven to produce antibodies, is there a way to test in a controlled lab if these antibodies attack the coronavirus?"
17397,Include it in the ticket price.
17398,Aren't there already covid fees anyway?

17427,Why do places require shirts and shoes?
17428,Should people who want to wear shoes stay home because people who don’t want to wear them want to go out?
17429,"No, everyone wears shoes or they don’t go in."
17430,Edit to add- the measure in favor of safety to society should always win.
17431,People who don’t want to wear masks can stay home and party if they want.
17432,"The people wearing masks are helping to stop the spread of a potentially deadly disease, and if not deadly, long term consequences from the disease."

17454,I feel like im the only one in the state that takes the virus seriously.
17455,It doesnt help that I work with my father and his friend both dont care about covid at all one thinks wearing a mask is unconstitutional.

17465,"You've shown that kids can get coronavirus (something I never argued against, I argued that they don't get very sick, which is statistically a fact)."
17466,"You've shown that schools can have outbreaks(something I never argued against, obviously they can, but risks should be mitigated and schools should be temporarily shut down if needed)."
17467,Illinois is having 5000 cases a day.
17468,Schools have had a reported 500 total cases of students.
17469,I see no evidence that nationwide or statewide schools are a major driving force of this pandemic.

17563,"&gt; To understand the safety parameters of therapeutic vitamin D supplementation, it is important to know that 10,000-25,000 IU/day are made in the skin in response to adequate sunlight exposure."

17565,"[8] However, after months of supplementation at these doses, hypercalcemia often appeared,[6,7] with reports of resultant deaths."
17566,"[9,10] Subsequently, much smaller doses of vitamin D were used to treat rickets, limited to 200 units per day."

17577,Which is actually a good thing.
17578,How’s living in Ireland?
17579,Here's what I'm saying.
17580,Let's say you have 3 people: A bartender and two patrons.
17581,"If the bartender and one patron are willing to accept the risk of being exposed to COVID, and the other patron is not, who's in the right to say, ""If you don't want to deal with our rules/lack of rules, stay home""?"
17582,"There's two mindsets: You as a patron of the bar are potentially exposing others to COVID and must wear a mask, or you as a patron of the bar are making the choice to potentially be exposed to COVID and have no right to force others to wear a mask."
17583,Why is one mindset wrong while the other is right?
17584,Just a total lack of empathy and caring about anyone but self.
17585,It is a twisted world.
17586,&gt;We had higher increases before and it’s quite a sweeping argument.
17587,"The seven day rolling average as of October 26 was 1,331."
17588,The week before on October 19 it was 822.
17589,That's a 61.9% increase in one week.
17590,On June 08 the seven day average was 864.
17591,The week before on June 01 the seven day average was 634.
17592,That's a 36.3% increase in one week.
17593,"I did a deeper dive and found one period where the increase was higher - the very beginning of the epidemic, and only for a couple of weeks."
17594,"Since then, even after the testing was expanded to include many more people, there has never been an increase as high as the last week."
17595,"&gt;didn’t report four days total

What?"
17596,Where did you get the idea I was talking about the four day total?
17597,"Here are the numbers from the latest spreadsheet from FHM:

    23/10/2020	1870
    24/10/2020	1478
    25/10/2020	516
    26/10/2020	922

1,870 is the total for Friday - a single day, like I said."
17598,"The total for the four days was actually 4,786, and the total for the seven days ending on October 26 was 9,319."
17599,"The current total reported by the FHM is 115,785."
17600,That means that 8% of all the cases reported by the FHM occurred in the last seven days.
17601,And that is not even the real total as there is a lag in these reports and we can expect the last day or so to increase above its current reported number.
17602, Only road-trip this year was to Fossil Rim outdoor/drive-thru zoo an hour west of Dallas about 1 month ago.
17603,Mask wearing was about 50% at the gas-station nearby.
17604,"In near north Dallas, it seems to be around 99%."
17605,We had these measures in Switzerland and they didn’t help much sadly.
17606,Looks like a lockdown may be necessary.
17607,"When this is over, If I ever have to hear about Zoom again, it will be too soon."
17608,Fuck Zoom.
17609,So mask wearers are a 2 on the callous/hostile/deceitful scale and non masks are a 5?
17610,This is an opinionated puff piece villainizing people you don’t know.
17611,This is borderline propaganda used to create community self policing over a binary decision.
17612,Media is being used to exacerbate a divided population.
17613,"If “statistics” say green eyed people transmit covid at a higher rate, we will see malignant behavior towards this group."
17614,Social commentary without statistical analysis is emotionally driven divisive control.
17615,"Right, and I'm saying my anecdotal experience is an increase in gatherings (which are moving indoors) alongside masklessness at those events."
17616,That's a good way to spread an airborne disease.
17617,I agree that opening up bumped numbers up but so is the quarantine exhaustion that breeds complacency and restlessness.

17633,That article is great but it’s a week old.
17634,The graphs of the states where hospitals are filling up look like exponential growth to me.
17635,I hope I’m reading them wrong and you’re right.
17636,"*They think it's not gonna happen to them, and they're the only ones who will be spared*

That is it, in a nutshell."
17637,What is scary is that there's a lot more narcissists out there than we thought.
17638,you don’t say?
17639,lol at the idea of the federal government doing literally anything besides confirming a conservative supreme court justice
17640,I do know couple of asthmatics who get bad reaction from masks.
17641,They do however keep the distance and even wear a mask if absolutely can't keep the distance .
17642,And they encourage others to wear masks.
17643,One of them probably already had covid in early February and seems to be suffering from long term effects.
17644,But she also is worried that she could be re-infected since the current strain is mutated so wears a mask when she can.
17645,Brave
17646,"That's with intent to get MORE people on planes, not to limit covid"
17647,Now we get to call them the party of death.
17648,Why would curfews do anything?
17649,"&gt;prevent hospitals being overrun

Define overrun."
17650,"Does it mean ICU's are full and patients are being turned back, or does it mean too many hospital staff are being infected with the virus?"
17651,Exactly.
17652,"No one who claims to be willing to die for this country, but isn't willing to follow basic orders like how to wear a mask and stand six feet apart couldn't get through boot camp with their ass intact"
17653,"My first nursing job here in the US, the Chief Nursing Officer threw out a statistic that up to a third of new grad nurses leave the profession for good by year 2."
17654,"For our facility, he was right."
17655,The elderly by virtue of being older and often confined to the indoors tend to be vitamin D deficient.
17656,They are also at the greatest risk of being hospitalized with COVID-19.
17657,Yes I’m aware that there are studies going on to do just that but it’s a long long way from ever being approved or even considered for approval.
17658,Doesn’t mean I want to be a beta tester.
17659,Also no one will stop or prevent you from doing so.
17660,"Even if it's a bad decision, it's a decision you're free to make."

17681,We've had that between states that are generally closed to each other here.
17682,Again this is where contact tracing comes in.
17683,New Zealand also had it come through freight (probably) but dealt with it through a short regional lockdown and contact tracing.
17684,Even the lockdown may have been overkill.
17685,"So far it seems the key is cases in low single digits + effective contact tracing, the latter is where Victoria failed."
17686,"Holy shit, are you me?"
17687,It kinda does matter.
17688,The Spanish Flu got really bad in the second wave.
17689,A wave is a simpler way to say the factors you mentioned are increasing in a wave like manner.
17690,That statistic is taken completely out of context.
17691,I believe its the study referencing long covid patients where 18% of those studied were admitted into hospital.
17692,Its an exageration.
17693,Because the probability of having organ damage is going to be higher if it is known you are a long covid patient.
17694,Furthermore 18% of younger people are not being admitted to hospital.
17695,No Idaho?
17696,True.
17697,Also some senators grabbed some of the money for themselves.
17698,It doesn't appear they had the nation's best interest in mind.
17699,Not surprising.
17700,My friend’s brother and family recently moved there.
17701,He told her he loves it cuz no one wears a mask and wants his whole family to move there.
17702,"Of course her and her over 70 year old parents wear masks and are very careful, so wouldn’t even visit."
17703,The funny/sad thing is that the no masks wearing comment was said as a good thing and brag.
17704,"Btw, I grew up in Houston."
17705,"No you're clearly racist and an ""all lives matter"" believer  so I'm not wasting my time arguing with someone that uses data to fit their narrative."

India today reported 38k new cases ."
17887,"On an absolute basis, That is almost DOUBLE less than france and on a per capita basis almost TWENTY times less than France."
17888,Way lower than most of EU/.Canada at the moment.
17889,"Indias total deaths is 119,355 almost half of the US and one of the lowest per capita in the world."
17890,"There was definitely miscounting of cases, deaths etc but the overall trend is a huge decline."
17891,If a second wave doesnt happen India would have pretty much kept this under control by end of the year or Early 2021.
17892,From personal experience the amount of infections in India is huge(really huge)-By myself I know close to 10-15 people infected in India.
17893,Multiple antibody studies show close to 300 million people infected.
17894,Another important point is India has largely been open the past month (including theatres and malls with reduced capacity).
17895,There is definitely a regional/genetic/hidden immunity component in this.

- No sitting in cafes, no cafe brunches etc (Melbourne has the best cafe culture in the world so this is a big deal)
- No more fancy nights out at a restaurant."
17906,But every so often we made a special effort to have a nice dinner and a few bottles of wine.
17907,- LOTS more walks.
17908,We'd go for at least an hour walk through parkland every single day at sunset.

- We usually go to Europe for a month or two every year, which obviously couldn't happen this year."
17914,"To add to this, I'm sure for many couples it's been a major stressor, but for my partner and I this has been a pretty great bonding experience."
17915,"And NB that the bulk of this (July - October) happened during a cold and wet winter here in Melbourne, so most of the time TBH most of the time we would've been bunkered down indoors anyhow."
17916,"For us, it's really just removed maybe once every two weeks having beers at a pub with mates and a fair bit of eating out at restaurants."
17917,"As an upside, we've both saved a shitload of money that we normally spend on pretty frivolous things, and we're planning on doing a 6-12 month road trip around Aus next year with the proceeds."

17928,I want to see my Parents but I don't want to mess with any data.
17929,I already got my second shot so I should be good to go if I got the vaccine and not the placebo.

17959,At that point mitigation measures like distancing and masking can pretty much end.
17960,I’m guessing that happens about the middle of next year.

18002,probably 6 to 8 weeks after a vaccine is widely available for all populations in a particular country.
18003,i feel like people will keep wearing masks as long as they need to but will stop distancing a lot sooner.
18004,"I remember back in March people on this sub were very loudly and confidently telling me that people would stop patronizing businesses with or without a lockdown, because they're afraid of getting sick."
18005,Made no sense at the time because if people would voluntarily stay home why even bother with the lockdown?
18006,"Anyway, my state is mostly open and people are definitely not staying home because they're scared to get sick."
18007,"Restaurants, breweries, bars, gyms, malls are all full of people."

18019,The ChAdOx1 viral vector is a little bit different in that it uses a chimpanzee adenovirus whereas J&amp;J uses a human one.
18020,"However, a new concern though for Crohn's sufferers is that the new [Crohn's MAP vaccine](https://www.crohnsmapvaccine.com/) being worked on use the same adenovirus vector as ChAdOx1 and it raises similar questions: Will the MAP vaccine ""take"" if one have previously had the ChAdOx1 vaccine?"

18027,"If you regularly suffer from constipation or slow movement of stool through your system, this may help though!"

If you look at it one way it is a sacrifice getting sick I will say that."
18065,"For example, the few thousand who die a year in car wrecks could be considered a sacrifice for having the ability to drive."
18066,"I look at those tolerable numbers, and I think society does as well, as default deaths."
18067,Maybe every untimely death is a sacrifice for something.
18068,But I think it’s a bit of a stretch to say all deaths from preventable illness are sacrifices for normality.
18069,They just are.

18085,"Well, you should blame your shitty government."
18086,"Of course people are out protesting when the country decides to ban abortion, do you expect them to stay inside?"
18087,"The courts did this during the pandemic because they knew people would be out protesting, but now they are happy to tell them to stay inside."
18088,If Poles don't stand up for their rights now they will be stripped away.

18110,I’m sorry you’re so agitated.
18111,"I will always call out propaganda, because I spent a long time looking at these sources that people have used to “support” their false narratives and always found nothingness at the core."

18113,"In Europe it was like this, a gradual rise again and then a surge."
18114,And this is despite a majority being conscientious mask wearers.
18115,"I dunno about that as a rule, I've met some pretty revolting human beings that worked as nurses, teachers, etc."
18116,"I guess it probably does hold as a broader trend, though."
18117,And why does it matter if the severity is clearly orders of magnitude lower?
18118,Except that masks protect other people if you’re asymptomatic.
18119,I was around other people in an unmasked situation recently and now I feel like warm garbage.

18123,That makes no sense until we have a vaccine or an instant antibodies verification app.
18124,Jesus.
18125,I tried but a bit auto removed my reply because apparently it was political.
18126,There’s not a lot of hospital “care” that can be given for covid besides oxygen or a cpap/ventilator.
18127,"If you get to a point where you need more oxygen and you don’t have access to it, your odds of dying are pretty high."
18128,China's peak was 146 death and it was on February 12
18129,"This will not be an outlier, this is just one of the first countries to go through a 6 month spell of cold weather."
18130,It's not that lockdowns haven't reduced the spread it's that lockdowns just haven't been close to enough.
18131,The Northern Hemisphere was lucky the virus first hit in spring and the warning weather gave better control.
18132,But what is happening now has no warm weather just around the corner.

18235,I definitely feel like I need a fresh start after all of this.
18236,"Shit, I was trending that way before the pandemic happened."
18237,I need like a solid year of traveling after this is over.
18238,The worst flu (other than Spanish flu) is nowhere near as bad as covid by any measure
18239,"Yep

Never thought I would miss walking through our crappy malls but I do"
18240,Schools are contributing to the “we are not going to control the pandemic” herd immunity philosophy.
18241,"They will be responsible for the deaths of many innocent Americans and community spread, whether they want to be or not."
18242,Just look and read the teacher forums.
18243,"Kids and staff are getting infected, and incompetent and spineless school administrations are bending the rules all sorts of guidelines resulting in the exposure of even more people."
18244,It’s awful leadership and decision making everywhere.
18245,Lets hope it’s not four years late.
18246,Remind me in two months
18247,"It varies by country, but in Greece and Argentina very few for example."
18248,Being remote is helpful in the sense that even if the virus is inside you can focus on eliminating it locally without constantly getting new seeds of infection.
18249,I don’t this this diminishes anything.
18250,"I am quite jealous actually, but realistically if you put the New Zealander government in the UK or in Peru or in Canada I strongly doubt they would bring the cases to 0."
18251,The prefabs [were even set up for negative pressure isolation which conserves PPE](https://youtu.be/3Sh7hghljuQ?t=532).
18252,Compare it to the [NHS Nightingale](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBrR3E3oI-E).
18253,Those open roofs aren't keeping the medical staff safe.
18254,"it’s been hard to tell if protests caused any spike in the USA, because there were a bunch of different protests: protests filled with people refusing masks, and other protests filled with people wearing masks."
18255,"open air or not, capacity and proximity play quite a role."

18260,"If you haven't contributed anything meaningful to the world in over a year, you don't get to tell other people how much they need to suffer."
18261,How's it feel to live off the teat of others?
18262,"""The small number of trials and lateness in the pandemic cycle is unlikely to give us reasonably clear answers and guide decision-makers."
18263,"This abandonment of the scientific modus operandi and lack of foresight has left the field wide open for the play of opinions, radical views and political influence. """
18264,This is basically the only part of that text I truly understand.
18265,"I'm working at a school that restarted in August and has been open the whole time so far, even though the school has had 6 known cases, one of which is a teacher."
18266,Private school.
18267,New Zealand has locked down their entire _country_ (twice!).
18268,Places like Melbourne have been in lockdown for almost _four months_.
18269,I have no idea why you put them on that list.
18270,Vietnam has had cities in and out of lockdown as late as yesterday.
18271,Are you paying any attention at all?
18272,Nice
18273,"Anecdotal, but my 6 year old is crushing it remote."
18274,I’m actually shocked.

18277,Always deliver on time and at budget.
18278,"But in this one car, MAYBE make an exception."
18279,"If the government had managed this well from the beginning, and individual people had collectively made moderate efforts, that's all we would have needed."
18280,"A year without concerts and motorcycle rallies and cruise ships would have been the worst part of it, and people would have still been able to get together with small groups of friends and family with the exception of maybe a short quarantine while waiting for a test result."
18281,"But the government shit the bed, and people felt like they would literally die if they didn't go to Sturgis, and Karen couldn't stand to wear a scarf over her face, so here we are."
18282,The government should have helped small businesses instead of large ones.
18283,The reason being that large companies can get loans.
18284,Not so for mom and pop.
18285,Definitely not a direct quote
18286,"Old news, and a lot has changed since then."
18287,The lockdown of those residential blocks did not last very long a couple of weeks for the most affected tower.
18288,Everybody was allowed out for exercise as well.
18289,And they got decent food supplied to them eventually once they sorted out food requirements etc.
18290,"This type of quarantine only happens for people deemed close contacts to cases, and it still happens."
18291,"In the case of these tower, if anyone tested positive, the entire tower was deemed close contacts due to the facilities."
18292,Anyone that was tested positive was give the choice to move into hotel accommodation.
18293,"For everyone else at the highest level of restrictions were we were allowed to get food and supplies, exercise for 1 hour a day, visit people requiring care, and go to work if you were in a permitted industry."
18294,The restrictions have been steadily eased over time and with general retail finally opening to the public from tomorrow.
18295,You were very on point and they had no reply so they attacked instead.
18296,"I mean, that method did earn someone a seat as President so I understand why people follow suit."

18304,You think so?
18305,About 85% of my workplace would take any of the frontrunner vaccines.
18306,But we work with the public and are regrettably familiar with catching far too many diseases from them.
18307,Nearly all of us get the flu vaccine annually.
18308,"We’ll do whatever we can to not bring covid home to our families along with the usual colds, flu, norovirus, pinkeye, lice, and ringworm."
18309,It’s amazing how healthy we all were for the five months we were closed...
18310,I hope there are more people willing to get vaccinated.
18311,What do you mean by false reporting?
18312,"Most of the world, including Europe and North America, reacted too late."
18313,Compare case arrival dates to action.
18314,"If two months have been allowed to pass, then you're almost certainly already screwed."
18315,"If you get cancer, you shouldn't wait for Stage IV to respond."
18316,"You should react at Stage I, very early on."
18317,The timing matters.
18318,NZ locked down within four weeks of its first arrival.
18319,"If they reacted sooner with a South Korean trace/ quarantine approach, then the lockdown may have been avoidable."
18320,"If NZ had delayed things by another month, then they would be the Italy of the Antipodes."
18321,"I know distribution will be a huge issue getting the doses out, but thanks for this gives me hope, I like numbers because it can put things into perspective and I like knowing that theoritically everyone could be vaccinated in 4 days."
18322,"I know that's in an absolute ideal situation and not representative of real life, but if comforting it's possible with the numbers."
18323,They don’t get F’s they just get pushed through and work menial jobs so you can get Burger King during a lockdown.
18324,The system is busted.
18325,"People in education don’t get that, which is surprising because the entire economic system we live under is a travesty."
18326,Nothing works.
18327,"There is no data on whether the vaccine provides sterilizing immunity, and also no data on whether vaccinated people, even if they do not achieve sterilizing immunity, are still able to spread infection at any meaningful level."
18328,This is all speculation
18329,They were to slow things down.
18330,"Also, half the population didn't follow best practices."
18331,I love how the default comeback for someone who has lost an argument is to accuse them of trolling.
18332,Your English comprehension is abysmal.
18333,I've pointed out numerous times that border restrictions along with suppression measures within the country are both essential.
18334,You're clearly too dumb to understand that oft-repeated point I've been making.
18335,Yet another strawman in your second paragraph.
18336,Nice one.
18337,The only issue at hand is whether or not border restrictions are effective at preventing covid transmission.
18338,"And, as you've admitted, they are."
18339,Relaxing border restrictions here was due to a general dislike of internal EU borders.
18340,They're only to be implemented when deemed necessary.
18341,"The Finnish government, along with other EU governments, thought they weren't necessary anymore, hence they were lifted."
18342,"And that, as is obvious by now, was a mistake."
18343,"Ah, gotta make sure to get in an insult about people not visiting Finland."
18344,Ouch.
18345,I'll get over it though.
18346,"This whole situation must suck for you, huh?"
18347,Border restrictions working and what not.
18348,I guess you'll have to wait until your next life to live in a world without borders.
18349,Masks aren't everything.
18350,Its not a replacement for physical distancing and reducing contacts.
18351,The thing is masks got politicized.
18352,"The populist right is often ignoring them out of a lack of trust in scientists and political leaders, but in reaction some progressives seem to think masks are the only thing that matters in trying to manage spread in their day to day lives."
18353,Keep voting in corrupted populists.
18354,👍🏼

18357,The number of COVID cases is so big the government can no longer hide it.
18358,"Since the beginning of the pandemic they lied, either by not providing sufficient access to tests, or just by straight up not not counting cases reported by hospitals."
18359,"But now the public helthcare system is on the verge of total collapse, there are no respirators, no doctors left, no PPE."

18449,Now post the death rates 😉
18450,Haha - saw that.
18451,Pretty impressive number of downvotes considering it was an entirely reasonable opinion.
18452,"Except there are examples of societies that actually care and although not all can replicate exactly, Japan and New Zealand have done incredible jobs, primarily because leadership acted quickly and the citizens care about each other for the most part."
18453,"I don't disagree on some of your points, as my area opened schools in the way you describe- masked, attempt at distancing, hybrid schooling- and the transmission within the schools is not looking to be a LARGE contributing factor."
18454,"I don't think anyone can accurately state it's not a factor at all, but the amount of spread is less than I expected."
18455,That being said... what our community has done around school being open is definitely not helping.
18456,"Sleepovers, parties, house parties, gatherings... all of these things have increased and are spreading."
18457,"Our state and county have, continuously, linked outbreaks to personal gatherings- and those are are then linked to schools because kids bring what they picked up there to the school."
18458,That is how school outbreaks happen.
18459,And despite the pleas (the district literally made a video begging parents to cut down on the social interaction outside of school) and the new restrictions (the state limited the number of people in a gathering to ten and from no more than two families) no one is changing their behavior.
18460,"The day after the new restrictions were announced, each of my kids was invited to two different parties, and neither wedding my husband and I were invited to were canceled."
18461,"When parents were successful in convincing leadership that their kids needed to be in person, they then took that to mean that their kids' lives should not be disrupted."
18462,"Social outlets and sports are now ""necessary part of education and development"" and so they mentally justify all of these choices."
18463,"As long as the government cannot go into people's homes and shut down the parties, they have less and less recourse."
18464,"So if families are refusing to make those changes, they may have no other choice than to close the schools."
18465,If they want to slow the spread.
18466,"The other option seems to be what I hear a lot, which is ""spread it amount the healthy, build immunity, end this sooner."""
18467,"I don't subscribe to that, but when the government is battling those two people groups, closing schools may be their last resort."
18468,And it still probably won't work.
18469,Borders are closed again.
18470,You stills have to pass an exception list.
18471,If your not a polish citizen you basically cannot get into the country.
18472,To be honest we were helped by the fact the coronaviruses are not exactly new and have been studied quite a lot
18473,"&gt;nce community transmission is suppressed and people don't renege on suppression measures, the only way it jumps back up is if it is brought in from outside."
18474,PERIOD.
18475,How does this simple fact not resonate with you?
18476,"It does, but many countries haven't got their numbers under control yet so they simply aren't at the state where their borders being closed is relevant."
18477,That's my entire point.
18478,"Countries aren't worried about foreign travel right now, their concern is suppressing the spread within their country, and closing borders does nothing on that front."
18479,Right now most countries are at the stage where they need to get their own numbers under control.
18480,You talking about border closures as a fix to that issue is a red herring.
18481,Full stop.
18482,When we are talking about getting domestic cases under control bringing borders into the discussion is irrelevant.
18483,This entire post is about how France has 52k cases in one day.
18484,Their borders being open or closed would not have significantly changed that number because it is all domestically spread.
18485,You bringing up border closures is completely irrelevant to the topic of domestic spreading.
18486,&gt;You keep bringing up America for some reason.
18487,THEY NEVER GOT IT UNDER CONTROL.
18488,NOT EVEN CLOSE.
18489,Yes because their leader is another troglodyte who thinks he can just close borders and be done with it.
18490,But that's not a solution for domestic spreading.
18491,It's a solution for foreign spreading.
18492,"But foreign spreading is not a concern to the vast majority of countries right now, so talking about solutions to an issue most countries (and the one which is the topic of this post) are not facing is beyond irrelevant."
18493,"Seriously, people are looking at ways to curb the spread within their countries and you mouth breathers are talking about closing the borders."
18494,That's a tough lesson to swallow.
18495,"That’s true, my question though is are some countries that are locking down doing any better though aside from maybe NZ and Australia?"
18496,Source?
18497,"Such an amazing feeling, thanks Victorians, we’ve done so well, keep it up!"
18498,"Taiwan, Singapore, New Zealand, Australia, Korea, Vietnam, they all figured out how to deal with this virus."
18499,You don't need to lock down for 12 months if you know what you're doing.
18500,"It's definitely possible, although so far it's been seriously overblown how much influence the Trump administration has been able to have as far as ""rushing it out"" (which is probably more apparent now than ever before, with the Oxford vaccine being apparently the most progressed one of them all, and it isn't American)."
18501,"Really though when all is said and done it doesn't actually matter how possible it is or isn't, the data will be public and speak for itself."
18502,"However it definitely DOES matter what people believe because that will impact what percentage of the population takes the vaccine, and it's clear that plenty of people are worried about the influence of politicians on this process."
18503,So it's important to mitigate that as much as possible.
18504,Maybe there is space in the Abortion Clinics??

18534,One other underlying factor that doesn't get spoken about that was a big deal was the weather during the lockdown.
18535,"The 7 weeks during lockdown saw extremely settled weather which made it way more pleasant to be in your bubble,go out in the yard or go for walks or bike rides (not you David Clark) and was most definitely a factor in the high compliance during the initial lockdown."

18610,"Right, but what if it causes infertility to those that take it?"
18611,Or leads to strokes years later?
18612,The reasons why vaccines work so well is because we test the living crap out of them.
18613,"A vaccine is needed soon, I agree."
18614,I have even considered signing up for a trial.
18615,But before it’s released en masse there should be sufficient testing done.
18616,At some point testing further leads to diminishing returns.

18629,The rest of us that don’t fit into those categories seem like we will have to wait a while until we can get the vaccine.
18630,"Me, for example, I would be at the clinic the day it’s first available if I could."

18633,"This is speculation, we do not have data yet on vaccine effectiveness, or whether or not vaccines provide sterilizing immunity"
18634,Nice fear porn.
18635,After being exposed a couple of times to coronaviruses people generally obtain affinity maturation and are unable to be infected anymore.
18636,"Even if reinfections are more common than we think, eventually the immune system will be able to permanently combat it."
18637,"Even then, its far more likely from what we know that the majority of reinfections will be asymptomatic or mild."
18638,"Asymptomatic ones had been happening for months and months (all the way back to April in Asia, but they were being dismissed as poor testing or long haul), just no one took notice until there were a few severe reinfections."
18639,Keep in mind the virus has shown to produce tcell and bcell responses.
18640,Subsequent infections will generally be less severe.
18641,"Not everyone has a proper immune response as well, which could explain rare severe reinfections."
18642,They're also studying the severe reinfections closer.
18643,There are dozens and dozens of asymptomatic/mild possible reinfections in backlogs that haven't been genetically tested.
18644,All in all the chances of people being infected over and over is extremely unlikely.
18645,Mild coronaviruses OC43 and HKU1 showed only 10% of people were able to be infected on their third introduction to the virus spaced out for antibodies to wane (**edit:** *for the record around half were able to be infected on second exposure*).
18646,And as mild coronaviruses these invoke a more mild immune response than SARS-CoV-2 in general.
18647,"Its much more likely this virus becomes an immunosupressed endemic disease (by vaccination and acquired immunity) that still circulates causing bad colds, but is overall mild for most people besides the small population left who has zero exposure to it."
18648,**Edit:** *When people say there isn't such a thing as herd immunity to common coronaviruses it doesn't mean you can't build permanent immunity to it.
18649,It just means reinfections are possible and the virus continues to circulate through the population.
18650,"* 

*Experts now believe the Russian Flu Epidemic of 1889 was actually caused by hCov OC43 as it jumped from cows to humans genetically around then in that region."
18651,It appears it killed millions and caused severe disease when it was a novel virus.

18662,"Great news but even after you get the vaccine, keep wearing your mask for a good while when you go out."
18663,It almost certainly will not be completely effective.
18664,If it’s 50 to 80% effective you still should wear your mask.
18665,This was a reality at many inner city Canadian hospitals pre-COVID.

18841,"it's more traditional rather than superstitious, we know scientifically it doesn't make sense but it just gives us some peace of mind."
18842,"&gt;  the one time Europe absolutely had to coordinate and work together

Uh.. remember the migrant crisis?"
18843,EU countries started bussing migrants across their countries to drop them off at the next border.
18844,They wanted to open up the province and this weekend we got 817 cases.
18845,Way higher than the first wave.
18846,"Cool, I didn’t have any plans until 2025."
18847,With less than 3% of the USA's population confirmed as infected it has a long way to go.
18848,"Even double that to cover un-diagnosed asymptomatic cases, there's still huge numbers of people that may get sick, have lingering side effects or die."
18849,Europe is exploding with extraordinary numbers too.
18850,Welcome to Reddit
18851,Ew!
18852,But accurate.
18853,lmao my point stands
18854,Biden winning won't change much as everyone will have it by then
18855,Then there's the long list of countries where it's between the official COVID numbers and who the fuck knows excess deaths.
18856,"It's hilarious that people think that demanding the whole of society be remodelled in order to alleviate their personal anxiety and inability to cope with their own potential mortality is actually the altruistic thing to do, even as hundreds of millions of people go hungry, lose a year of their social life and head towards a decade of economic depression."
18857,It would be hilarious if it wasn't so fucking tragic.
18858,this seems like super discrimination.
18859,lol.
18860,"You say it was boring, not tough, you are fortunate to be able to say that."
18861,Good luck my man/woman!
18862,"Stay strong, I am hoping quick recovery for you and your family"
18863,"I do genuinely appreciate the concern but I'm not over here saying that people should be confined to a 5km radius of their own home (as in Ireland, currently) or saying that we should only socialize in ""bubbles"" like a lot of the media says."
18864,"I find just find that shit way crazier than just about anything on the anti lockdown subs, barring some of the weirder conspiracy shit."
18865,"Maybe if restrictions were more reasonable, like limiting mass gatherings and that kind of thing I (and others) wouldn't feel like the world has gone completely insane, but that ship has long sailed in most places."
18866,"it tripled in around one month.. if it stays at this rate, it will be a very long winter for the French.."
18867,Where's your degree in epidemiology?
18868,I'll trust them over q00qy any day of the week
18869,[deleted]
18870,Is there a technical definition of a wave?
18871,Is a second wave possible if the first never ends?
18872,Yes.
18873,Yes it would be better for the economy to sacrifice human lives to let the economy prosper.
18874,"It would be morally and ethically wrong, and I am against it, but it would be better for the economy."
18875,"It's like asking, would a bonfire be bigger if we threw several priceless paintings on it?"
18876,"Yes, of course it would."
18877,But why even ask the question?
18878,Does anyone see where in the studies they factor in the likes of Felicity Huffman and others buying their children's degrees?
18879,I'm not sure this article is anything more than fear-mongering.
18880,"Thanks for the explanation, I just get “conservative or aggressive?” from the firm handling my IRA"
18881,and he’s right.
18882,I never accepted the convention of third wave.
18883,Wave means it has to vanish then come back.
18884,It never vanished.
18885,These movements are minuscule compared to a circulation of the virus that increases exponentially and then stops almost completely.
18886,"If America had multiple waves, then France and other European countries had tsunamis."
18887,Fauci is right.
18888,"Why wouldn't he be, he's one of the foremost experts on the matter."
18889,"If you look at what qualified as waves during the Spanish Flu, it's consistent with what Fauci is saying."
18890,The movements you're talking about are inconsequential at the scale of the entire US.
18891,"I don’t really see it in waves personally, we are beyond waves it’s a fucking Tsunami until we get a vaccine."
18892,America is to irresponsible and impatient to even try to keep numbers down till a vaccine is out.
18893,Now I know I was talking in the sense that it’s the entire country.
18894,But I know there is a lot of good people on out there that want to do the best they can to stop this virus.
18895,"I personally believe it's scripted, and the arguments we see on The Five are part of a show rather than genuine arguments."
18896,Seeing someone you disagree with (Juan) being shot down by 4 people makes for a more satisfying watch than just 5 people agreeing with each other.
18897,This is what I have been trying to explain to people non-stop since the very beginning.
18898,"The fact that there is asymptomatic infectivity, the low mortality rate and the fact that a lot of people don't get that sick when they get it *is* the reason why it's so goddamn scary."
18899,It's the perfect storm.
18900,So many people in my life could not understand why suddenly I was scared of a virus when I've always been the one in the past to be like 'yes this is kind of bad but it's probably not going to amount to that much that will effect you'.
18901,"There's a reason why the biggest outbreaks of ebola, to use everyone's favourite viral boogyman, are the strains with lower mortality."

18905,Proud to call you neighbours.
18906,Looking forward to crossing the border and doing some shopping and sight seeing.
18907,"They (we, I live in the NYC metro) were hit first."
18908,"Which makes sense, given it’s a huge cosmopolitan tourist area."
18909,A couple months later doctors already had a better idea of what to do and what not to do.
18910,"What our states did here worked to curb the virus, we know this."
18911,"Also we were hit before mask mandates and by the time other states saw their waves, the idea of wearing a mask was nothing new."
18912,Turd immunity
18913,You need friends for that.
18914,"Yes exactly, the problem is all those countries with no cases opened too soon."
18915,"If only they had stayed in lockdown for the last 8 months then it would have made the ""just two weeks"" of lockdown at the beginning work!"
18916,"No, we gotta reopen now!"
18917,If we wait 10 hours we could lose hundreds of thousands of jobs!

18924,No.

18926,"Its not coming at all, most likely."
18927,The dems will have to flip the senate in addition to Biden winning.
18928,"Without both there will not be any stimulus that doesn't include corporate immunity, bailouts for billionaires, and mere scraps for the 20 million+ unemployed that the repiblicans will vote for, along with abolishing the ACA now that Amy Covid Barrett just got confirmed in record time."
18929,McConnell will block EVERYTHING out of spite if Biden wins for 4-8 years.
18930,"(a la Obama 2 terms)

Trump and company will sabotage the economy further during the lame duck period to ensure Biden inherits the worst economy since the great depression, half out of spite, half out of thier 2024 playbook."
18931,"Hell, even if the dems take the senate, presidency, and retain the house - somehow the Republicans will find a way to filibuster any reasonable stimulus."
18932,"Meanwhile 10s of millions of Americans slip into the black hole of poverty, or worse - into homelessness and desperation."
18933,"And the richest continue to get richer through this whole mess, regardless of thier policital party."
18934,"Merry Christmas, America."

18936,&gt;Excuse me?
18937,Is that a justification for detaining Uyghurs?
18938,"Trust me, the Uyghurs in China were treated a lot better than people in ICE camps."
18939,For me it's more that living by your beliefs is a powerful motivator.
18940,"By all means lobby the government to stop subsidising, but also don't fly eight times a year and drive a pickup truck."

18945,Sounds about right for Americans honestly
18946,Every day opinion differs on this subject.
18947,"One day all the articles are heralding a strong long lasting immune response, the next day articles like this one come to the opposite conclusion."
18948,Much about covid has gone this way.
18949,"One day airplanes are safe, the next they are flying petri dishes."
18950,"One day masks work, the next they don't."
18951,"One day children are low risk vectors unlikely to catch and spread covid, the next they are driving the huge surge in infections."
18952,What is going on... And what to believe?
18953,Easy to stop believing in science.

18955,Where exactly is a civilized part of Alabama?
18956,I’m just curious.
18957,People will comply when hospitals begin to overflow and start publishing triage plans.
18958,"But I read on reddit that social distancing is harmless, healthy and easy to follow for everyone."
18959,"Well a good quality diaper would keep most of it in, but eventually some is going to leak out."
18960,"Of course you’ll want to change your diaper regularly, not just because you’re full of shit, but the outside could be contaminated with other peoples' shit."
18961,It’s basic common sense that you don’t want to reuse a dirty diaper and a improperly worn diaper that leaves your asshole in clear view of the world isn’t going to contain shit when your blowhole erupts like a whale breaching.
18962,No.
18963,"As Biden pointed out, a federal mask mandate is likely unconstitutional."
18964,"And if any mandate can be ruled unconstitutional, it would embolden more people to declare that all mandates and restrictions are unconstitutional."
18965,You may be aware of the recent news surrounding the Supreme Court.
18966,"I have a lot of confidence that a federal mask mandate would result in a domino effect that, in the long term, would greatly erode state and local authority to enforce any social distancing."
18967,What do you do for enforcement?
18968,Think of all the maskless people who will be sitting in courts to contest their fine spreading.
18969,Extremely difficult?
18970,Really?
18971,Just look at a chart of &lt;insert European country&gt; right now und tell me again how extremely difficult is to see clear waves.
18972,"I see so many people concerned about flu season and even a possible ""twindemic"" (even though the flu hasn't caused major problems like covid-19 so I don't even know why people are saying that) but given the fact that people are social distancing, wearing masks and going out less, shouldn't we all have a much more relaxed flu season?"
18973,"Not to mention people who didn't get the flu shot before will get it this year (me included, I would never get it cause it always gives my parents terrible symptoms but this time I'm getting it), we've already seen that, flu cases compared to last year are down in several parts of the world."
18974,"Yes, this is why no one wants US citizens in their country right now."
18975,I think a lot of it shows how much American Democracy was built on the hope/assumption that people (especially PoTUS) would generally abide by rules and traditions and that governing bodies (especially the Senate) would intervene if someone got out of line.
18976,Those assumptions don’t hold for some
18977,"Oh, please, the shitwater is a hoax!"
18978,Anyone who gets out of the pool is a sheeple!
18979,Because they are now evil.
18980,"They're*

And yes they are."
18981,Then it's great news!
18982,Maybe!
18983,"I don't really dive in to US state specific stuff being not from the US, but its entirely possible they were talking about their states within discussions that were otherwise nationally focused and its all blurred together in my memory."
18984,"While possible, that doesn't explain the fact that these populations are seeing disproportionally high rate of growth in comparison to populations compromised of younger people."
18985,You would think that those younger people in those communities wouldn't suddenly see a spike weeks after similarly aged people in other communities did.
18986,"Another hypothesis might be that the young people in these communities are more socially similar to old people, after all young people that tend to live in communities like that would most likely have less people to socialize with and value socialization less."
18987,At the same time does this really change the end take away much?
18988,"The pandemic is spreading to more isolated populations, be it less social young people or old people or whatever."
18989,"Or, it could just be as it seems and old people are indeed getting it more often now."
18990,"Which is the same trend you see in any infection, it takes root in exposed populations (young social people) and then gets into vulnerable populations later."
18991,Weed
18992,Humans should in general have rights like freedom of movement and freedom of association.
18993,kinda sucks for Chinese vaccines though because they aren't tested in the EU and USA..
18994,"I know, this thread is shocking."
18995,I usually come here to see how these sad sacks are coping.
18996,This is a pleasant change.
18997,Every school district is pretty much back in person for the most part.
18998,"They are playing a constant game of whack a mole though, one school opens and two schools shut for 3-5 days."
18999,The amount of community spread by playing this game is probably incalculable.
19000,It appears schools across the country (for the most part) are open for business.
19001,"Might be off base, but couldn’t by chance be having any impact on the infection rates hitting highs beyond March-April?"
19002,"In the future, I wonder if they will look back at that one element and cringe about how much it drove the upcoming winter chaos."
19003,"Or at least community service as a sanitation worker in the local covid yard to get a first hand look at people struggling and dying alone, with an overwhelmed hospital staff."
19004,I'm sure every hospital can use more sanitation and disinfection.
19005,"And the city itself is about to be at an 8% positivity rate, triggering the same restrictions."
19006,Indoor service at bars was reopened October 1st in Chicago.
19007,It didn't even last a month.
19008,What was the point?
19009,People got 1 month of drinking at a bar to suspend the notion that this is a deadly pandemic out of their heads.
19010,"Well now reality is snapping back, and this will be the last week they'll get to do so for the rest of this winter."
19011,The city and the rest of the nation won't be able to save these businesses by letting them stay open like this any longer.
19012,The lack of any cohesive federal response is annihilating any capability for their economic survival.
19013,This will be a winter we won't soon forget.
19014,He’s wrong but whatever
19015,Lolllllll
19016,[And we have that in the CDC.

19018,"Man I know what you mean, I was actually going out to the park regularly too but now I've become wary just because people don't even think of staying 6 feet away"
19019,But what if you are Covid personified?
19020,I have symptoms for covid (female / 19) but cant get tested right now because there isnt a testing center in my city and I can't take public transport.
19021,(The only people who could drive me are in the high risk group so I do not want to endanger them either. )
19022,"I know (or hope) that if I have it, that I probably won't die, but I am very scared because of the bad situation in our hospitals, i don't fully trust them if I'd really get bad."
19023,Any tips what i can do at home to ease symptoms from people that had covid?

19107,THANK YOU DR FAUCI!
19108,This is exactly why there *needs* to be a **federal** law mandating masks **right fucking now**.
19109,"In many ways this doesn’t go far enough however, because often even people who wear masks do so wrongly."
19110,By no fault of their own.
19111,It just happens.
19112,For this reason there should be a task force of specialists who can monitor that these masks are being worn correctly.
19113,They can spread out into the communities and do this work.
19114,"As part of that, people who have willfully put their fellow citizens in danger need to be identified."
19115,This obviously includes anybody who voted for Trump.
19116,These people should have a special insignia on their masks so they can be identified by authorities for the sake of the public good.
19117,Their children should perhaps have a slightly less conspicuous symbol on their masks — something to identify the very real risk they are in as a result of being raised by such enemies of society and of science.
19118,"As part of a new nationwide emphasis on public health, citizens should be encouraged to identify people who are “enemies” of this progress."
19119,"Once identified, these individuals should be given a chance to repent and change their ways."
19120,"But this progress will of course need to be monitored by the government, so they should have a third type of insignia on their masks, to ease identification."
19121,"To facilitate compliance with the new public health measures, a new agency of the government should be created."
19122,The task force I mentioned above can easily be adopted to this work.
19123,These individuals will be employed by the federal government but not identified as such.
19124,This is to help gain a measure of trust from the population.
19125,"Their jobs will be to keep files on individuals within their purview, and update these files regularly to track progress."
19126,"Obviously people who willingly violate the new mask law will have to be separated from society — for the good of society, as well as for their own good."
19127,This will be dealt with humanely and fairly.
19128,Not at all like Nazis.
19129,These individuals will simply be separated from their families and society and moved to a safe place for a time being.
19130,All perfectly humane and fair.
19131,These safe places will seek to educate them to the evil of their ways and the harm they are doing to the world.
19132,Once re-educated they can be returned to society.
19133,Of course repeat offenders will have to be dealt with a little more harshly.
19134,But this will be for their own benefit.
19135,"Eventually individuals who have proven to be a menace to society and a danger to the security of the state, will have to be permanently removed."
19136,"This too will be done humanely, but the key is that it will be done for the good of the collective whole."
19137,Because in such a system there will really be no space for individualism.
19138,This selfish attitude is exactly what got us into such trouble in the first place.
19139,"So selfish activity will have to be controlled in all aspects of society, especially the economic realm."
19140,Individuals will not be allowed to hoard cash.
19141,"A progressive tax policy will of course help this to be redistributed, to aid the less fortunate."
19142,"With cash hoarding outlawed, banks will not have any reason to exist."
19143,So they can probably be done away with first.
19144,People who run these banks will have to be identified as enemies of the state and placed in camps until they see the error of their ways and can be returned to society.
19145,"But of course they will not be allowed to enter in an advantageous position, but somewhere near the base, where they will be reduced to doing manual tasks that help the greater good."
19146,Needless to say they will also have a special insignia on their masks that identifies them as a part of this dangerous class of individuals.
19147,Business owners of all stripes will have to receive the same treatment as the managers of banks.
19148,Of course they will be understanding and will welcome an opportunity to make amends to society.
19149,"However those that do not will, for their own protection, have to be removed from society."
19150,There are other measures that will have to be taken vis-a-vis the bourgeoisie who have brought so much pain unto the country.
19151,But that can be tackled later.
19152,**The important thing is that it should 100% be against the fucking law to leave your house without wearing a mask.
19153,"**

Frankly they should require wearing them even when you are home and even when you’re alone."
19154,But for now it should simply be strictly outlawed in public.
19155,Anybody caught flaunting this very important rule will have to be dealt with very harshly.
19156,Penalties are not enough.
19157,"Imprisonment, of an indefinite period (at least a year, and up to five or even ten years) for first time offenders."
19158,"No exceptions, no appeals."
19159,Second-time offenders are sent to top secret camps permanently.
19160,These camps will be for degenerates and other repeat violators of these laws.
19161,For security reasons they will have to be off limits to all but a small group of security professionals with special clearance.
19162,Red Cross and other international organizations will not be allowed anywhere near their premises.
19163,This to make sure such harmful individuals are kept out of sight and out of mind.
19164,"It is only fair, correct, and proper that such measures are taken against people who willfully go out in public without masks."
19165,"That’s definitely true lately, but this is actually written by their Chief Business Editor, surprisingly"
19166,"It's about free babysitting to those people, they could care less about education."
19167,Jesus not this shit again.
19168,"Are you really such a complete fucking dipshit that you failed to grasp the last 7,000 times people carefully explained that the US number is an annualized number that is in no way comparable to the actual % change reported by other countries?"
19169,The fact that the US number just so happens to be almost exactly 4 times the Aussie number and there are 4 quarters in a year didn’t at all jump out to you as peculiar?
19170,How fucking stupid can you possibly be?
19171,I’ve taken shits with more brain cells than you.
19172,"&gt; US Olympics-sized

What's that?"
19173,Are you not expecting to have access to the vaccine in 2021?
19174,I see no reason to not go to large gatherings if you are vaccinated.
19175,Ha ha ha ha ha *cries*
19176,"&gt; a lot of people already have

Yes, I see them on the fast increasing daily covid numbers."
19177,You have shit between your teeth.
19178,**compared to America.
19179,"I stay inside 24/7, I agree!"
19180,I guess I’m just trying to be optimistic.
19181,I haven’t hugged any of my friends or family in 9 months.
19182,It’s really rough.
19183,"Not so sure about the curb the virus part...

https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/07/us/new-york-city-coronavirus-outbreak.html"
19184,"considering your whole point / post was that those people are something theyre not (&amp; compared one word to another), yes"
19185,NPR is so afraid of being looked at as biased that they give airtime to some shitty people these days that lie.
19186,Most MD’s in Utah as well as other places are predominantly atheist/agnostic.
19187,"If you want Mormon bishops, you’ll find they are the dentists and plastic surgeons."
19188,"No, it’s a useless and misleading measurement."
19189,"Drunk driving deaths only cause 0.003% of all deaths nationally, but that doesn’t mean it isn’t dangerous or stupid."
19190,At this point I'm ready for might-harm-me vaccine over will-definitely-kill-me virus.
19191,My lungs would probably not hold out through Covid.
19192,Thank god he is not practicing in medicine.
19193,"My husband and I both work in a hospital, so we will
be in the first wave of vaccination (especially me, as I work directly with patients)."
19194,We might loosen up faster.
19195,"But right now, that day looks very far because of the chaos of health care."
19196,The second wave is hitting us like a brick because we didn’t get to relax much from the first one.
19197,We are now super understaffed and overcrowded with patients.
19198,I came home crying this weekend.
19199,"And I work in a green unit, not even a covid infested one."
19200,"I see, I'm like 90% sure I was positive at one point, as I was also sick for 4-5 weeks in March/April after being in NYC for 5 days, but I just want the confirmation now that I've had lasting symptoms."
19201,I updated the original post with something I found on my healthcare provider's portal.
19202,"Says the antibodies could potentially last for years, but like you said, that doesn't mean it's detectable."
19203,I will look into if I can find more information about the specific test I was administered.
19204,Does my vocabulary mistake change anything about my point?
19205,The FDA already shot down Drumpfs attempts to bypass their new more thorough approval procedures luckily
19206,You are also a well off nordic country with a much smaller population  and population density.
19207,You still do worse than your neighbours.
19208,Who are you kidding?
19209,I mean if there's a dangerous or potentially-deadly situation going on &amp; you're unsure of the official messaging maybe best to take the 'better safe than sorry' approach instead of throwing up your hands &amp; acting like people who can't imagine a few months without a brewpub outing just can't figure out left from right
19210,So parents should have to risk their children dying because a few kids are too lazy to login to their online class?
19211,It's bad enough during normal classes when these same kids take up the teacher's time with behavioral issues while the kids who actually want to learn have to sit there and wait.
19212,We don't need to hold everyone else back to match the weakest students.
19213,"It's sad if some kids come from disadvantaged backgrounds, but I won't risk my child's life to score woke points."
19214,Are they not talking about the USA?
19215,"their first wave never ended, which is why there has not been a second."
19216,Cases are low?
19217,Have you been paying attention?
19218,It's fucking April all over again but this time we decided not to lock down and all the schools are full.
19219,We're pretty much fucked.
19220,"And since we are buying a vaccine, or best case develop our own 6 to 8 months after the other big players we will be up the Creek until at least July."
19221,Sorry dude but you got some serious tunnel vision going on.
19222,Ok. People's lives ones are doing of COVID and being cremated or buried in single plots in cemeteries.
19223,You think they should be dumped in mass graves.
19224,You're an ass hole.
19225,Why you gotta be disrespectful like that?
19226,"You're talking about people loved ones, acting like putting them in mass graves is a good way to punish COVID deniers."
19227,What the fuck dude.
19228,Thanks!
19229,"I do take Vitamin d (35micrograms), omega 3, biotin and a normal multivitamin each day."
19230,I kinda hoped the vitamin d would keep me from getting infected next to.
19231,"staying home as much as possible and mask / hand sanitizer , now I hope it will save me from long term damage if I do end up being positive for covid."
19232,Maybe if you complain about masks a few thousand more times people will magically start wearing them.
19233,fr I’m in a similar field and the term wave is not exactly ambiguous.
19234,not really sure why it’s even a point of contention tho as it doesn’t really matter either way
19235,downvoted for posting facts...
19236,I’m so sorry!
19237,That sounds so scary!
19238,I hope you are doing okay!
19239,I hear this a lot and I feel guilty.
19240,The virus has had no real negative impact on me.
19241,"Sure, the masks are kind of annoying and I don’t get to see my friends or family bas much/in groups/inside but the benefits of working from home being normalized have far outweighed the drawbacks."
19242,My wife and I have good jobs and we don’t have any kids yet though so I know that my situation is the minority.
19243,I have it right now and it really ain’t that bad tbh.
19244,I had a fever last night but I’m all good right now.
19245,I’m experiencing a bit of a cough and my head hurts but certainly not as bad as lyin ass Fox News made me believe 😂💯
19246,Anxiety
19247,Have I got a graph for you.
19248,"Its the only true and logical way to represent the data without downplaying it or exagerating it: 

https://covidly.com/graph?country=United%20States#growth

Here's a video explaining it: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54XLXg4fYsc

After looking at that graph and watching that video I challenge you to still call those three little blips ""waves"" in comparison to other countries on that graph like Germany and Italy."
19249,The U.S. is doing about as good as India and Brazil (which is not saying much at all).
19250,And cannot seem to find that eject button yet.
19251,"And as a little kid, burning the paper was pretty cool."
19252,"Will probably continue burning paper just in the thought, my dad did it for his parents, maybe he'd like it if I did it even if doesn't actually matter and it didn't seem like he thought very much of it either."
19253,"The folk regions across east and southeast asia are unorganized and an amalgamation of all sorts of regional folk religions smashed together with Confucianism, Taoism, and Buddhism (probably more)."
19254,Even far less organized than Buddhism.
19255,Oral tradition.
19256,"All the paper burning, incense, plates of fruit and maybe occasionally a chicken."
19257,"I can't enforce correctness, every family seemed to do things a bit different."
19258,"I don't think folk religions which make up much of the religious in China, Japan, and Vietnam have the kind of centralization for cult like swings like hating on masks"
19259,Hoping you can hug her and wish them mazeltov in person.
19260,I'm glad she's found just the right one for her.
19261,It’s sad!!
19262,Reminds us that in the Us we were lucky..didn’t need the hospital ships and the field hospitals were set up and available quickly!
19263,Hopefully they find a solution in Poland.
19264,I hope they have enough equipment and people to treat everyone:(.
19265,which one would that be?
19266,the FDA announced it would be 60% at their meeting last week
19267,dumb take
19268,you made a post about semantics and couldnt even take 3 seconds to google the words youre using?
19269,"antisocial is like, murderers"
19270,There were sacrifices that were not made early enough for a sufficient period of time.
19271,The only ppl with a right to complain about corona “fatigue” are those who have been masking and distancing while everyone else behave like lemmings
19272,"Nah, we’re doing better / the same as the rest now."
19273,It varies from week to week who’s worse.
19274,"And we’re definitely better off than Poland right now, despite Poland having mandatory mask usage (and curfews iirc)"
19275,Well you're right because he just dismissed the fallacy completely.
19276,And vaccines.
19277,[removed]
19278,I've been going back and forth with this idiot for a while now.
19279,"It's fairly obvious that both internal suppression measures (masks, distancing, lockdown) and border control are necessary to get things under control in a given country."
19280,The suppression measures are going to be of limited use if people carrying covid keep entering your country.
19281,The fact he/she doesn't understand as much is pathetic.
19282,"And the best part is, I live in a country which is a perfect example of this."
19283,We imposed border controls along with suppression measures and got daily infection rates down to single digits during the summer.
19284,The government decided to loosen border controls and - stunner - we've got hundreds of cases a day now.
19285,It's like the virus just spontaneously generates in our damn cities.
19286,"That, or the increase in international travel."
19287,And you guys opening up and being a success story somehow means all the other places that opened up and saw teachers and students getting sick with covid didn't happen?
19288,"In other words, nothing will change and the numbers will keep rising."
19289,[removed]
19290,"&gt; And no, ""just keep the schools closed"" is not a viable solution


Counterpoint: Online education would have been worth trying for 4 months."
19291,"We gave up before we even gave a good faith try, and our spiking disease numbers likely imply school reopenings lead to community transmission."
19292,"Take Vitamin D right away, many studies support vitamin D sufficiency being related to good Covid outcomes (though you need to take it for a long time to raise your level, it doesn't hurt to start now)."
19293,"Also you may as well try Vitamin C and Zinc, also often taken but with not as much evidence backing it up."
19294,"I'm sorry about yer ma, again though, never heard of people being affected by the flu like that before."
19295,Edit;that's why I asked in the first place.
19296,"i would guess the big fear is that anyone with flu like symptoms may have to quarantine since it's similar to covid, but also anyone who has covid like symptoms may think it's just the flu and go about their normal business."
19297,Doesn't Japan actually do contact tracing?
19298,As opposed to US.
19299,laugh because we deserve what we get.
19300,"That isn’t where their infection rate us coming from, tho."
19301,"Man, I agree."
19302,Namely because Greg is a way more popular name than Chad amongst the caucasians 😉
19303,A lot of people around me could give a shit less.
19304,"Flooding the stores, at least half not wearing masks or wearing them as a chin diaper, they'll even take them off to talk to you!"
19305,People act like they NEEEEEEEEED all this shit from all these stores at every waking moment of the day in order to survive during the pandemic.
19306,Absolutely ridiculous.
19307,Thanks to president Cunt
19308,The whole thing is utter nonsense.
19309,Painting 340 million people with the same broad brush - defined by the worst among them - is not a productive way to look at the world.
19310,The horrors you're describing are indeed terrible.
19311,More terrible than many can imagine.
19312,But many are having their own struggles which can be very difficult to them.
19313,It's insensitive to them to dismiss their issues simply because an oppressive regime is brutalizing its people as an extreme example exists.
19314,No reason it cant.
19315,Stop feeding the trope that somehow what Australia has accomplished is because we lack a land border with another country.
19316,That has almost nothing to do with what is going on here.
19317,"You're did substantially worse than your Scandinavian neighbours, you killed off tons of elderly people, you still do worse than your neighbours."
19318,I applaud
19319,Good job Victoria!!
19320,!
19321,I don't believe I live in a 'bubble' or in the wilderness.
19322,Would be nice though!
19323,I've had the flu a few times.
19324,It's never been an issue.
19325,I'm sick as shite for a couple weeks and that's that.
19326,Done.
19327,I never looked into the flu as I never had a reason to.
19328,"Where I grew up, the flu was never an issue unless you were old and frail as fuck perhaps and in that case any disease would fuck you anyway."
19329,"I'm not talking about covid being the same as the flu at all, I was merely enquiring about flu shots."
19330,&gt;In the United States I believe you're underestimating the effectiveness of the US military.
19331,We are absolute weirdos in how we disproportionately invest our money into the military versus people/science.
19332,"But for once, we may finally reap some benefit."
19333,"Until the vaccine is developed, there will be uncertainty but once the product is ready you best believe the logistics problem in the west will get dealt with."
19334,"&gt;  
&gt;The distribution problem goes face-to-face with the most fearsome military machine in the history of man."
19335,I've been telling coworkers this for months.
19336,"We haven't seen a real DECREASE in cases large or long enough to break the first wave, it's slowed down at times but we're still on the rise."
19337,It's fucking absurd.
19338,It’s like a miracle.
19339,It’ll just float away.
19340,Schools are not daycare.
19341,This kind of attitude is why no one wants to be a teacher.
19342,Mexico had a pretty large population boom from 1950-80.
19343,But Mexico has never been able to meet or even match US military or economic power for a reason.
19344,Europe and America dominated the 19th CE because of their vast populations.
19345,"Up until the 1950s, Latin America's populations were comparably tiny."
19346,"You know, this one time when people should coordinate and work togther, we hear some still saying covid is a blown out of proportion hoax..."
19347,"&gt;because they were smart

No, because they were experienced."
19348,I vote Greg 100%.
19349,Old hatreds die hard.
19350,You know who you are frid

19352,I thought it was Kyle or Kevin.
19353,"That's true especially while exhaling, but you'll need to protect your eyes, too."
19354,And yes I do not want to pay taxes.
19355,And I don’t want to pay even more for your shitty GND or any other pie in the sky socialist garbage you think makes sense and are economically illiterate
19356,Asia includes India and south east asia which do not do well in covid19.
19357,"the post was talking about countries that have a good covid19 response in term of low death rate, and attributed them to the lower life expectancy."
19358,so i look up countries with good response and i got those.
19359,"if you want to compare the UK response to India, go for it."
19360,"UK wants to sink that low to countries without proper toilet at home, fine with me."
19361,Colonavirus.
19362,"the flu vaccine after many years of iterations is not even 80-90% effective

also google says the measles vaccine is 93% effective in one does and 97% in two doses but again, how many years has it been improved to get to that point?"
19363,i wasn't aware the phase 2 results were written up yet.
19364,could you link me to one of them so i can read how effective it was?
19365,"You think this is bad, wait until the US military gets sent to a war, by the same group of politicians, to fight an enemy that's to Iraq what COVID is to the common cold."
19366,"The cost of hubris, denial and dysfunction during a pandemic might be lost lives, but the cost of the same problems during a war, a real war, is loss of everything."
19367,"And if you think that war is hypothetical, you have no idea how close and inevitable it is"
19368,3rd phase of the first wave
19369,Everyone must watch this new documentary called ‘Totally Under Control’.
19370,"~ “Filmed in secret over five months, Totally Under Control uses news footage and interviews with experts and government whistleblowers to show how the administration missed each opportunity to either stop the virus from arriving in the U.S. or prevent its spread."
19371,"The filmmakers present these events in rapid, blow-by-blow succession, lending the doc an urgency that contrasts with the languid federal response to the pandemic.”

Here’s a link 

[Totally Under Control ](https://vimeo.com/470270419) it’s also available on Hulu and Prime."
19372,Got em.
19373,[deleted]
19374,YSK that the events of the last 7 months have created a huge fucking backlog of patients for things not relating to Covid.
19375,If hospitals WEREN'T being strained right now something would be seriously wrong.
19376,What compliance lol.
19377,"These people who ""can't handle it"" now never really could."
19378,"&gt; the vaccine, coupled with a continuation of public health measures like face masks and social distancing, could help move the US towards “some form of normality” by the middle of next year."

19396,And consider the fact that not every PCR is sequenced
19397,"As I've shown in my links to the previous flu seasons, he is clearly lying and just pulled 80,000 deaths from his a**"
19398,The issues were numerous.
19399,The first lockdown was very restrictive and population complied.
19400,"However, when the infection wave have not materialized people started opposing it."
19401,There was a street pressure with demonstrations against the lockdown in Ostrava and Prague in front of the Health Ministry which the populist government caved under.
19402,"Between mid-May and the end of September, the health threat panel did not meet."
19403,The PM started to overturn various measures in August and September and the government was sending contradicting messages.
19404,This undermined the trust in the prevention and the majority people started to believe the Covid was hoax.
19405,This was reinforced by various ‘specialists’ from the medical field but not in virology.
19406,"You got dentist, cardiologist, and other downplaying the infection."
19407,Any doctor saying otherwise like the director of the most hit county hospital in Uh.
19408,Hradiste was accused having a political agenda.
19409,The approaching regional election at the end of September wanted to be won by the current populist government that sacrificed thousands of lives to maintain hold upon regional government.
19410,"Pretty much until last week, media was full of posts and articles downplaying the Covid as nothing more that cold or seasonal flu."
19411,I read at least four detailed articles analyzing overall mortality rate in Czechia with a conclusion that the deaths were within the acceptable margin of statistical error.
19412,"It was not until couple days ago when Covid became a leading cause of death in Czechia, when articles that minimized the infection spread prevailed."
19413,Slovakia actually covered overflowing Czech hospitals with far more detail than any Czech media.
19414,The Covid deaths in Czechia falls in to full responsibility of the current government and inability of 1/3 of voters to see the danger.
19415,So?
19416,Sounds like a good deal.
19417,"If you work all night to get lucky, is it really luck?"
19418,[deleted]
19419,Hasn't it always been Kyle?
19420,I thought this was agreed upon.
19421,"My parents got ""tired"" of dealing with the pandemic."
19422,Just found out today they met with someone who in turn was in contact with a positive COVID case.
19423,And of course they didn't wear masks.
19424,"I hope it comes to nothing, but people need to stop thinking that being tired of dealing with the pandemic doesn't mean it's going to go away."
19425,The fuck am I getting at?
19426,You want to say oh wow all these countries have helicopter evacs for free.
19427,And that isn’t the fucking case.
19428,Stop lying.
19429,The money has to come from somewheee.
19430,There is no such thing as a free lunch.
19431,I’m sure you’ve never heard of it based on your limited  understanding of economics and how taxes functionally work.

19437,8 months and still in the first wave?
19438,Fking hell.
19439,The good news is vaccines are looking promising.
19440,"(Still in for an bad winter)

We are making the Oxford vaccine here in Victoria."
19441,It occurred to me today maybe given our position we should be supplying more of our production to USA and Europe.
19442,It seems we don't need it as much as others now.
19443,bro ppl gonna have a criminal record because they forgot to put a piece of cloth on their face
19444,Did you read the article I linked.
19445,"The virus spreads easier as it gets colder and even thrived in cold enivornments

When winter hits you guys again you'll see cases rise too."
19446,Just not as quickly.
19447,(unless there a vaccine).
19448,[removed]
19449,Yeah it’s an extraordinary turnaround!
19450,"The only country I’m aware of that made such a huge comeback is Singapore, which was reporting around +1000 new cases down to single digits."

19456,Why were we not enforcing these hygiene and distancing policies pre-covid?
19457,And why not mass use of masks pre-covid?
19458,I'm honestly ashamed I ever viewed those asian countries that widespread used masks in a dubious/questioning light.

19464,I guess you won't be happy until teachers are sick enmasse or dead?
19465,"But hey, as long as little Billy gets his education the hell with everyone else."
19466,"Because the Australian government is willing to provide income to the citizens who would normally be earning it via tourism, whereas the US gov is largely unwilling to financially support individuals and businesses who stop doing business, leaving them with little choice."

19473,What?
19474,Plenty of suburban districts are back in a hybrid model
19475,TLDR: Your Coronavirus Test Is Positive?
19476,It Probably Shouldn’t Be.
19477,Your hyperbole was even wrong
19478,"And later on the “no shit” news network, cats are cute."
19479,Have you ever taught?
19480,There’s no way of doing it properly.
19481,Dang!!
19482,"True, so sad :("
19483,The US is one country...
19484,"I agree that being able to return in a way that's safe, for school districts that are as large and (in some places) not well funded as Chicago Public Schools is...very difficult if not impossible."
19485,I'm lucky enough to be in a rural area (which has its own problems) where we can employ a hybrid model that really limits the amount of students in a classroom and the amount of days they are there per week.
19486,"However, it's a bad look to not even come to the table."
19487,At least discuss it!
19488,You don't have to agree.
19489,You probably won't.
19490,But we should try
19491,Minimally-educated people with low social conscience are making the pandemic worse.
19492,If we keep kids out of school we help create more minimally-educated people with low social conscience.

19499,Do you have a job and are you an adult?
19500,generically speaking for a new vaccine coming to market.
19501,"in this case, yes they based it on old research, but that research had been stagnant for a while not worked on consistently for that long."
19502,also one of our primary vaccine candidates is a company that's never previously gotten out of stage 1 trials.
19503,"hopefully this is their breakout vaccine haha, but i think people get a bit overly hopefully about the immediacy of a vaccine, how fast it will roll out, how effective it will be, etc when likely whatever we get now will be improved significantly over the course of the next few years"
19504,Reddit is too dumb to understand that making generalizations like that is a terrible way of thinking and a good way to piss decent people off.
19505,"Yeah, no one would describe CPS salaries as shit pay"
19506,"The risk at your age is extremely low, and being female is also correlated to better outcomes."
19507,"If you are looking for additional supplements, there is some preliminary evidence in favor of melatonin, https://www.reddit.com/r/covid19/search?q=Melatonin it is a relatively mild sleep aid and worst case scenario is that it doesn't help with Covid but improve sleep quality, which should help with both anxiety and immune systems."
19508,Take care.
19509,I for one have no idea why this would apply to the US.
19510,"It couldn't possibly be because millions have lost their livelihoods, ""slipping"" into extreme poverty in a country with no safety net and a for-profit healthcare system that'll bankrupt you if you get sick."
19511,I'm sure none of these stressors would compound the negative effects of prolonged isolation.
19512,"Everyone is in a terrible situation, it's a fuckin pandemic."
19513,At least they aren't dead or disabled.
19514,Child care is a lot more important to society than below average educators
19515,Not true of normal vaccines?
19516,"Maybe true of the flu, but there’s a lot of factors going into that."
19517,Vaccines like measles be 99% effective.
19518,"There’s no way of knowing right now, but the way this virus works and given the responses we’ve seen in phase 1 and 2 trials, essentially all vaccines look like they’ll be on the more effective side."
19519,Hooo spicy I like this.
19520,Can you elaborate on her hackiness?
19521,Fountainhead has a broken premise which is pretty bad but Id kinda like to beat the proverbial horse.
19522,"It's like you've never been in a public pool... Aside from it being an analogy, I've been to numerous public pools over the years and have regularly seen kids wearing diapers in the public pool."

19528,"You're the one who made the claims about the ""incredible"" leadership in Japan, so you back them up."
19529,That's how this works.
19530,"I'm not speaking on behalf of an entire country, and no one would need to take me seriously if I tried."
19531,"By the same token, no one has to take your unsupported assertions seriously either."
19532,It depends on the region.
19533,The price is state regulated but also adjusted to local living standards.
19534,Plus you get a few (maybe 3) levels of choices.
19535,"So you could pay more and stay in a 5-star hotel if you want, in some places at least."
19536,I didn't get to choose when I came back to China early this year.
19537,I also didn't pay.
19538,It was free back then.
19539,I guess it helped the hotels a lot during lockdown.
19540,But recently we had national holiday and normal hotels (the ones not used for quarantine) are full of tourists again.
19541,I wonder if it's cost effective for the hotels to remain for quarantine only.
19542,The local government must have some sort of deals with them.
19543,he posted a photo of him at ta fair.
19544,i mean why is SF having a carnival at GG park anyway?

19556,He is useless but I would take him for 10 years over trump for one.
19557,Especially when you're being laughed at
19558,Making the mitigation debate all about mask wearing was a brilliant move on the part of shitty politicians who don't want to actually do anything.

19599,"And I’m saying that in spring and summer, the virus will still be here and still be a threat."
19600,It’s not going away because people are tired of it.
19601,"The virus sets the timeline, not us."
19602,And a vaccine isn’t going to completely eradicate it from society.
19603,Oh that’s been my point.
19604,A whole bunch of governors (since our federal government is useless) basically just said “you all need wear masks and social distance!
19605,"Small gatherings spread the virus” and then walked away, without even looking at any of the other countries that beat this."
19606,"In Texas, our governor pretty much said “coronavirus done."
19607,"Now to sign laws protecting police and limiting voting!”

It’s like, if people want us to social distance and wear masks, it’s a two way street and our government has to meet us halfway."
19608,Our State just had a petition to remove all Covid restrictions.
19609,Going out now scares me more then ever.
19610,I went to the store yesterday and the amount of people not wearing masks or giving a dang was just way to high.
19611,I know people are sick of Covid but Covid doesn't care if you are sick of it or not.
19612,"Messaging was also not consistent in the USA because, in part:

  * officials deliberately lied about the effectiveness of masks
  * officials changed messaging on masks multiple times
  * officials lied about the severity of the pandemic in public while saying different things in private 
  * officials distributed and in some cases continue to distribute information which is obvious bullshit, such as there being little to no airborne spread
  * officials keep changing the goals of the various painful &amp; disruptive mitigation measures
  * officials were not only willing to look the other way but in some cases stuck their necks out to promote outright risky behavior (gathering in large groups to protest) in a manner which was highly dependent on the politics of the group doing the protesting 

so you're damn right, downvotes, because your explanation left a ton of shit out."
19613,I teach high school in CA; we had a case last week and another confirmed today.
19614,The administration is asking us for our seating charts to see where those kids sit and are only telling teachers to quarantine if the infected kid sits within six feet of the teacher’s desk.
19615,I encouraged my department not to hand over seating charts until we have in writing that they will tell us if a confirmed case was in our room while we were teaching.
19616,It doesn’t violate HIPPA.
19617,They don’t have to tell us which class.
19618,Assholes.
19619,Canadians were getting $2000/month for quite awhile.
19620,USA is looking like a cruel joke.
19621,It's so hard...it's even harder when your kids know people are out living like nothings going on and they ask why cant we.
19622,It sucks so hard.
19623,I should have put them in quotes.
19624,Those are the crazy things I’ve been hearing
19625,Get well soon.
19626,Have fun banging the gf!

19628,With the thousands of bills the house has passed that haven’t been voted on I think it’s a fair assumption that there’s no room on his desk.
19629,Maybe a filing system of some sort or maybe they just go directly to his junk mail folder.....
19630,I know one women who told me her mom died from Covid in South Africa but STILL went on to talk about how all the restrictions were BS and the virus is being used to fear monger.
19631,"I wish I was lying, she may be a special case but I couldn't believe it."
19632,Hi neighbor.
19633,I’m proud of what our teachers and staff have accomplished by now.
19634,"The students, including the little ones, have behaved very well, according to my teacher friend."
19635,I’m crossing my fingers for the winter.
19636,False.
19637,5 months I'm Qatar.
19638,5 in Mexico.
19639,Where is this magical vaccine because we’re the only country that has branded treatment therapy as vaccine.
19640,Vaccines build your immune system to prevent the infection in your body before you get it.
19641,What we are building today are just anti-virals and symptom-minimizers and we’re calling them vaccines.
19642,"If u get covid19 and u get a vaccine to treat your symptoms, you’re really not getting a vaccine—you’re getting medicine to treat your symptoms."
19643,The Reason why were calling it a vaccine?
19644,Because calling it that gives hope that people will at some pint take a shot and never get covid19.
19645,Want an Honest fact?
19646,There are no cures for human coronaviruses and there are no vaccines for any human coronavirus.
19647,What makes ppl think a novel coronavirus is something we can create a vaccine for when we still don’t fully know who will be harmed more than others if infected?
19648,Because being able to isolate individuals and clusters can prevent community spread in places that have low or no prevalence.
19649,People wearing masks can still spread and catch the virus.
19650,"We don't actually know how effective masks are, there's never been any published controlled experiments."
19651,Just models and lab simulations.
19652,"That's like after an accident you'd say ""Look, only the front got crushed and the airbag saved us, so we why did we brake?"
19653,"That was just overreacting!"""
19654,There’s no point of debating with anyone on this post.
19655,Nobody cares about children or their education.
19656,90% of the people here are just being privileged and selfish adults who don’t care about children because it doesn’t concern them and they had their opportunity to progress socially and academically through school without disruption.
19657,Now some facts.
19658,Number of people smart working in italy in 2019: 520k.
19659,Number of people smart working in September 2020: 8+ millions.
19660,Online lessons in place for everyone starting march 2020 to june 2020.
19661,This is the reality.
19662,And that was done from one day to another.
19663,They had 6 months to prepare.
19664,They failed to do so.
19665,As for the money exactly because the state cannot keep paying forever it would have been wiser to pay a little to prevent this from happening.
19666,Bars and restaurants have been opened for 5 months.
19667,But the thing got out of control when students came back to school.
19668,Again this is factual data.
19669,Mark my words: prepare for a lockdown and more deaths.
19670,Because the only solution to control the spread is to close the schools.
19671,All of them.
19672,They mismanaged the situation bringing the same arguments you are writing here.
19673,"The reality is these claims are false, dangerous and as a result people are dying."
19674,Stop believing in santa and have a look at reality.
19675,There was chances to do that over the course of the pandemic.
19676,"If basic health guidelines were mandated, like early in February / March, economy would have taken a hit - but not this massively."
19677,"There also were dips in case numbers when it went down to like 20,000 a day - and if social distancing, mask-wearing, etc etc were followed by everyone, the case numbers would have continued to go down."
19678,"All of those chances were squandered, and now it’s winter."
19679,"It’s not gonna be years, but I wouldn’t get your hopes up with that."
19680,"Vaccines are a supplement to NPIs, not a replacement."
19681,"&gt;The database covers all SARS-CoV-2 cases in Qatar and encompasses data on all polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing conducted from February 28-August 12, 2020

Stop misrepresenting this study."
19682,That is not the absolute risk of reinfection.
19683,It's the risk of reinfection in a closed population over the course of 5 months.
19684,We have no idea what happens after that based on this study.
19685,The Mexico study found found significantly higher odds.
19686,About 1 in 400 over 5 months.

Why do you think Manhattan escaped the carnage in NYC relatively unscathed?"
19688,People had the means to distance and protect themselves.
19689,"Looking at Qatar and Mexico, which one is going to better resemble the unchecked spread you advocate?"
19690,This is the same issue as the 10% herd immunity garbage you pushed.
19691,"You looked at a population engaged in social distancing and other mitigations, and concluded that must be the case for uninhibited spread."
19692,Lo and behold we now have outbreaks in communities with 40-50% seroprevalence.
19693,I think it depends on where you lived.
19694,My schools never had one.
19695,Try living in Florida.
19696,The governor cares more about what tourists think rather than what Floridians think.
19697,A literal death cult.
19698,Most people may *think* they are in the middle because they each have their own ideas of what being too cautious or being too reckless is.
19699,"So if we each have a different idea of what those are, how can we gauge who’s being too cautious or who’s being too reckless?"
19700,I think 5000 have died already
19701,Baaaaaaaaaam.
19702,Told ya.
19703,Told ya told ya.
19704,Told ya
19705,He’s right!

19714,Que cagada hombre.
19715,Mierda.
19716,That isn't even close to the point.
19717,I have literally nothing to prove to you or anybody else in the thread.

19723,HELLO FELLOW STORY COUNTY CITIZEN!
19724,At least I wont be alone.
19725,Huxley seems fine so far...
19726,No.
19727,"I think people will start taking more precautions before it reaches that point, which is my point."
19728,But 5000 a day is hardly unthinkable.
19729,That’s 100 per day per state.
19730,Most of the states have had stretches that were higher than that - just not all at the same time.
19731,How can we gauge what being cautious or reckless is if we each have our own idea of what those mean?
19732,"Send it on up, semi experimental are my thing."
19733,There's literally no place on earth thats been able to mitigate the virus with masking alone.
19734,People are overstating the effectiveness because its become a politicized issue.
19735,They help but its no substitute for a coherent government response.
19736,"Okay, so the flu vaccine is actually a cocktail."
19737,"Flu mutates *very* quickly, much much faster than coronavirii."
19738,"There’s an incredible number of flu variants with different antigens running around, so medicine boards look at the strains in the opposite hemisphere and try to select the three most dominant ones."
19739,There’s problems with that because A.
19740,"They can  and frequently completely miss the mark on what that strain is, B. the top three strains don’t cover every single strain, and C. even if the correct strain is selected, the targeted antigen can change quick enough that it outpaced vaccine development."
19741,So you end up getting a relatively ineffective flu vaccine.
19742,"Covid-19, thank god, does not suffer from these problems, at least at the time I’m writing this."
19743,"Not only that, but flu vaccine technology hasn’t really improved since the 60s, and there haven’t been major attempts to do so."
19744,"Flu just isn’t really that much of a problem, so there’s no grant money to improve delivery methods or any of the tech that could bolster immunogenicity."
19745,"The Covid front runners and a couple outside that are all new tech which would, in theory, but based on the aforementioned results likely be better at producing a stronger immune response."
19746,TL;DR comparing flu vaccine efficacy to a potential Covid one is an inappropriate comparison.
19747,"I don’t think any phase 2 has finished yet, but we have readouts that state their immunogenicity, including antibodies and all that."
19748,You don’t need a phase 2 trial to complete to see if a vaccine produces a strong immune response- it’s mostly so long for safety reasons.
19749,"I’m away from my computer but give me a couple hours and I’ll get you the readouts for Oxford, Moderna, and Pfizer’s candidates- they’re all very strong."
19750,"Not just weird, but I immediately think that person is a stubborn idiot asshole."
19751,it's the same as the masks.
19752,first they tell us they don't work then tell us to wear them.

19758,There was never a decline.
19759,Yeah same.
19760,When they're really young it's nonstop.
19761,Eventually it does slow down but doesn't stop.
19762,The idea that kids won't take covid home to their parents and stuff is insane.
19763,Some things in life do matter and an infectious disease that has paused many lives and needs addressing is worth an attempt at worldwide unity.
19764,Many will die UNNECCESSARILY and the 220k+ that lost years if not decades would likely argue your point.
19765,"It's okay to have empathy and if you want to continue life as normal at a time like this, than an ostrich can bury their head in the sand."
19766,It doesn't make the teeth feel any less sharp.
19767,You just won't witness the carnage with your eyes closed.
19768,"&gt; they're talking about the number of people who have died from the virus

Correct."
19769,But there are more than the 200k that have it.
19770,"200,000 cases **REPORTED** - how many people are asymptomatic?"
19771,Those numbers vary from 40-60%.
19772,So add those in there too.
19773,That number changes and goes down dramatically.
19774,Its not a 2.6% death rate unless you *only* count the number of cases reported and deaths associated with those cases.
19775,Thats not the true CFR at all.
19776,"&gt;The database covers all SARS-CoV-2 cases in Qatar and encompasses data on all polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing conducted from February 28-August 12, 2020

Stop misrepresenting this study."
19777,That is not the absolute risk of reinfection.
19778,It's the risk of reinfection in a closed population over the course of 5 months.
19779,We have no idea what happens after that based on this study.
19780,The Mexico study found found significantly higher odds.
19781,About 1 in 400 over 5 months.
19782,"https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.10.14.20212720v1.full.pdf

Why do you think Manhattan escaped the carnage in NYC relatively unscathed?"
19783,People had the means to distance and protect themselves.
19784,"Looking at Qatar and Mexico, which one is going to better resemble the unchecked spread you advocate?"
19785,This is the same issue as the 10% herd immunity garbage you pushed.
19786,"You looked at a population engaged in social distancing and other mitigations, and concluded that must be the case for uninhibited spread."
19787,Lo and behold we now have outbreaks in communities with 40-50% seroprevalence.
19788,"Haha okay then, wherever you need to tell yourself to feel superior."
19789,what
19790,Why do you say that?
19791,He copies and pastes this lunacy daily.
19792,Its not sarcasm.
19793,Its insanity.
19794,We actually were hoping to test it out on you guys first
19795,"Please no touching, air high fives are corona acceptable."
19796,"I live in Germany, but only 5 km away from the border to the Netherlands."

19798,"I was surprised, that I was the only one wearing a mask."
19799,"No one even tried to hold distance to one another, there were a lot of crowded places."
19800,"Haven't been there since, I was shocked."
19801,Damn.
19802,You showed me!
19803,New York did curb the virus.
19804,"If other states that NYC apparently helped spread it to could NOT curb the virus, that is not New York's fault and doesn't take from New York's success."
19805,We worked hard around here to get numbers way down for months.
19806,"Also, Europe has been found as the primary source of infections in NYC."
19807,What's your point?
19808,"[https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/08/science/new-york-coronavirus-cases-europe-genomes.html](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/08/science/new-york-coronavirus-cases-europe-genomes.html) [https://www.nbcnewyork.com/news/coronavirus/new-cdc-report-confirms-first-covid-cases-in-ny-came-from-europe-other-states/2518796/](https://www.nbcnewyork.com/news/coronavirus/new-cdc-report-confirms-first-covid-cases-in-ny-came-from-europe-other-states/2518796/) It's travel that does it, NYC is a huge tourist destination internationally and nationally."
19809,So which stocks do I buy now?
19810,Isn't he Dr. hitler von murderstein according to plandemic?
19811,"Yeah, one of my asian coworkers wore a mask to work when she was sick last year, before COVID."
19812,"I was just thinking ""huh, that's so freaking polite of her."
19813,"Why don't we *all* do this?"""
19814,But I had literally never thought of it before that.
19815,"Of course, it would still be better if we had the freedom to *stay home* when we are sick, instead of being pressured to show up for our shitty jobs."
19816,"I feel myself getting a little slack, but then I read a comment like yours and if kids can do it, I can, too."
19817,Thank you all again for helping!
19818,"Yes, Texas, the USA and the world will pull though, because everyone's not going to get sick and/or die."
19819,But the excess deaths and unnecessary suffering really sucks!
19820,I simply wish that things had been handled in a different/better way.
19821,Thanks for the comment and the kind sentiments!
19822,Sounds faaaaake
19823,&gt; Why is he suggesting that people break the law?
19824,"There's a real, legitimate answer to that question but I'm apparently not allowed to say it because that would be ""political"" and the automod will devour it."
19825,"So, no."
19826,You're not allowed to know why Rand Paul does what he does.
19827,Trump has no information.
19828,He just lies a lot.
19829,Test and trace is much more important.
19830,riiiiight.
19831,so you think millions of unnecessary deaths won't have any negative effects?
19832,derp a derp derp.
19833,I have 2 special needs kids who are doing virtual school right now.
19834,"It's challenging, sure, but I wouldn't say virtual school is worthless."
19835,It does require at least one very involved parent though to make it work.
19836,"Yea, I'm honestly the same way."
19837,I work in the hospital so I see everything first hand and then I go shopping only to see the general public not even attempting something as simple as wearing a small cloth over their mouth and nose.
19838,Its draining and some days I just have a lot less faith in other people than I wish I did.

19908,I never once mentioned Europe or praised because they aren’t good examples.
19909,Your personal opinion doesn’t change the factual information that shows how capable contact tracing is for Japan and the overall compliance to wear masks and distance.
19910,Healthier diet is also a factor but don’t act like it is the main reason Japan has experienced over 100x less deaths than America based on population.
19911,New Zealand is one of the most progressive countries in the world and took extreme measures.

19919,That was my idea!
19920,But unfortunately it doesn't work.
19921,The idea was in case Covid got so crazy that no workers were left and we needed a governmental decision.
19922,"However as we found out, your immunity goes away quick and you get infected again."
19923,Not sure if the second time is worst.
19924,Because a restaurant owner surely has a medical team in the back that can test waitress applicants to see if they had covid or not.
19925,The wave just gets bigger.
19926,Its more like a squall.
19927,"Because it’s a lot easier for 99% of this sub to get on their high horse, say “masks” and blame Trunp or [insert other politician here] and virtue signal that they are part of the solution."

19929,"Nah, they could've held out until a vaccine is available or, at least, the rest of the country wasn't surging so they could send resources to the rural areas."

19931,"People should see the animation at the bottom: https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/10/15/us/coronavirus-cases-us-surge.html

19973,"In the US, some places are only just getting started, with plenty of places still to be hit."
19974,"The reason NYC was hit so bad early on is because it's the capital of the world, with millions of travellers and tourists passing through."
19975,'Blue' states were hit harder initially for the same reason.
19976,More rural 'red' states are less well travelled and connected and so the virus has took longer to take hold.
19977,Viral load seems to be an important factor in outcomes.
19978,If you get hit with a lot of the virus before your immune system gets started it's not gonna end as well.
19979,That's why a lot of medical staff were dying early on in China and Europe.
19980,"Now that we are all wearing masks and taking other precautions, even while infection rates are high, fatalities are much less than in April."
19981,"People are getting infected but with smaller doses of the virus, and do have a better chance of recovery."
19982,A reduction in deaths should be apparent when most people are taking it seriously.
19983,Areas in which people are not taking precautions should see a higher death rate.
19984,Rand Paul is truly a piece of shit.

19995,People infected SARS Cov 1 still had antibodies showing up 17 years after they were infected.
19996,Did I ever mention immunity anywhere in my statement?
19997,Apparently “people like you” can’t seem to grasp simple reading comprehension and would rather try and put words into people’s mouths.

20030,"&gt;The over-reliance on a vaccine (to control the pandemic) is not wise,” said Stephen Griffin, a Leeds University associate professor of medicine."
20031,You mean this?
20032,I wonder if he’s talking about the need to keep up the social measures for control?
20033,Touché.
20034,It puts the anal in analogy.
20035,Thank you!
20036,I'm not a physiologist of any sort so hopefully someone else can chime in.
20037,Weird that the reported symptoms don't seem to correlate at all with which organ is misbehaving.
20038,And these are pretty typical symptoms for anyone with a longer-than-usual-term viral infection.
20039,"I think it's a little dramatic to use phrasing like ""organ damage""/""organ impairment"" for something like an enlarged spleen (and others) that are totally reversible and most often temporary with no long-lasting consequences."
20040,You can't really just compare it straight to total positives.
20041,"They only count reinfections after 90 days, so you have to subtract out every positive from the last 90 days, and everyone who died from before the 90 day window because they obviously can't get reinfected."
20042,Especially in the USA where the head of the government has actively tried to downplay and discredit the crisis.
20043,It was left up to county decision.
20044,We have a democratic governor in a republican state- it's hard to get stuff done.

20047,Let's classify covid as a STD since it's in semen while we at it.
20048,I wouldn’t phrase it like that.
20049,"As the other person also said, it’s not up to the hospitals etc to control the spread, rather it’s the government that has to do that on top of also giving the health sector enough funding."
20050,"I live in Denmark, which Fox has called a socialist nightmare before, and our healthcare system is handling the COVID load just fine, and most other non-covid issues are being treated as usual (however you maybe have to wait longer)."
20051,"Socialized healthcare, at least here, is great."
20052,"I use one card to check in at the doctors, book a time online, get into the library and pick up my (subsidized) prescriptions."
20053,"Also, there’s a cap of 500$ a year on prescriptions, so the government will pay everything after 500$ altogether."
20054,"The system can be a bit slow sometimes, however in recent years the government has put more and more money into the systems that have the biggest need (like psychiatry) and overall our system functions well."
20055,"Now it’s not perfect, Denmark has issues, but we’re a good example of how socialized healthcare can be excellent."
20056,You just need good politicians to control it.
20057,"If poland addressed their healthcare deficiency years ago like they should have, by improving facilities and wages, they wouldn’t have this issue."
20058,"Writing this from my job in a hospital where I work for a mental health unit (different state, though)."
20059,Hopefully things starting turning around for you all.
20060,It should be discussed.
20061,But most schools don't even have a way to properly separate kids nor will they enforce wearing of masks.
20062,"Hell, before Corona, if you didn't have your kids' latest vaccination records submitted to the school they wouldn't let them attend."
20063,For diseases that were fractions of a percent less likely to spread or hurt or kill others.
20064,"Oh, your Tdap is one month past due?"
20065,"Oh no no no, your kids can't come to school."
20066,"Now in a pandemic, they don't care."
20067,"Just go to school with a virus that we have no vaccination for (yet), little in the way of treatments, and highly contagious."
20068,Little to no government funds or time to make proper changes to schools to make it properly safe.
20069,But send kids to school.
20070,this virus kills 5 times more than the flu.
20071,"12k people die annualy in the US of the flu  
More than 200k died in 9 month."
20072,How will it be enforced?
20073,"Thanks, I hate it."
20074,OH MY GOSH!
20075,Barbara Bollier's campaign is PUSHING so so so hard.
20076,I get phones and texts DAILY since the mail-in ballots went out.
20077,"Yeah, that's how to treat protesters!"
20078,Surround them in a ring of steel!
20079,Definitely not a fascist's wet dream
20080,Yes.
20081,And this is the critical factor.
20082,"(pun NOT intended)

I was reading some numbers, and to staff an additional, say, 10 ICU beds takes 2 MD, 6 ICU qualified nursing and 8-10 support staff."
20083,"(Recommended, on average)."
20084,"But you put your finger on it, it's not a bed/room/equipment shortage it's personnel."
20085,"That also means, however, (putting on my cynical hat) that when the hospital says they are dangerously close to being overwhelmed what that actually means is ""this is gonna cost us a shit load of overtime, have to hire some expensive contract help, and we will burn out our staff""."
20086,Not much you can do to add beds.
20087,There are probably empty rooms one floor down.
20088,So why was that ever an issue?
20089,We seem to have warehouses full of ventilators.
20090,and he is right.
20091,"&gt;At the end of the day, in person education needs to be a priority

I don't believe this."
20092,Safety and getting through this is more important than 1 year of education that's affected.
20093,Possible death or 1 year of education affected.
20094,Really think about this.
20095,"&amp;nbsp;

&gt;States and the government need to do what they can to get students safely back in classrooms where they can properly learn."
20096,And here is the problem.
20097,One side (republicans) are pushing this in grossly inhuman way.
20098,There NEEDS to be a point to go back in.
20099,"But right now, the push is ""just go back."
20100,"Masks aren't mandatory""."
20101,It is too early into this to be going back.
20102,"The ""safely go back"" option is to wait until true treatments (like the one trump got) and vaccines (even if they're only partially effective) are out."
20103,Then start integrating.
20104,"I don't agree with shutting everything down, but at the same time some large groups are pushing callous solutions."
20105,"&amp;nbsp;

&gt;But to students struggling in whatever way, especially low income students, this year of education means the world to them and will affect them for many years to come."
20106,I agree.
20107,They'll be affected.
20108,"Everyone, not just them, will be affected."
20109,This is something huge and impactful.
20110,And the solution will not leave people unscathed.
20111,"Right now, you're advocating pretty much go learn at the expense of some 10% of teachers dying (lets be honest, a lot of teachers are older or not in the best shape), some children, and a ton of adults that get the virus from the children going to school."
20112,I SEE your argument and it is a valid point but I just can't compare  a year and 4 months of affected school work and education growth to DEATH.
20113,"Avoiding death should be a priority and with everything, there needs to be a balance."
20114,"&amp;nbsp;

&gt;because it doesn’t necessarily regard them."
20115,"Well, it affects me."
20116,"In late february, early march (before trump shut down and before France shut down), I was one of the first with lysol, spraying the doorknobs, spraying my desk."
20117,"And I can tell you, even though the education isn't as good as it was, I don't want to risk my health or my life just to go back."
20118,"Heck, the school recently proposed going back to teach online while in the classroom (no kids, but they set up a lot of projectors, 65 inch tv's cameras that follow you around, good quality mics supposedly, etc) and even that I don't want to do because that means going to a place that others (cleaning staff, maintenance staff, other teachers) have been to and maybe spread the virus."
20119,"On top of all that, I'll be meeting with fellow teachers and friends and that'll put me in a position where it'll be awkward to isolate from them."
20120,"So, even without students I don't want to go back."
20121,I have faster internet at home.
20122,I have a faster computer at home.
20123,I have better audio at home.
20124,No need to go risk it.
20125,"Yes, education will not be the same for this year for most people."
20126,"My health, the health of my students, the health of the children's family, and the health of the community is more important than getting 70-80% of the class instead of 80-100% of the class."
20127,"EDIT:

Speaking about the social aspect, that's another hard one."
20128,I like to label myself an extroverted introvert.
20129,I like to be alone most of the time.
20130,"But the few times I do go out, I like to enjoy myself with the friends and acquaintances."
20131,"Many can't believe I'm an introvert because when I go out with them, I'm a top 3 figure in group outings."
20132,"DUring the pandemic, I've gone out twice with someone."
20133,"I've risked it for them but after the date/outing, I've asked myself, ""was it really worth it to risk my health, my parents' health since I live in the same building""?"
20134,"Going back to work (again, even without students), I'd feel the social aspect of having to and wanting to socialize."
20135,But is that really more important than possibly getting very sick and dying or infecting a loved one or family member?
20136,"&amp;nbsp;

I just keep going back to no, it isn't."
20137,"Yes, if definitely does."
20138,I believe the installation of the current administration's latest puppet (aka Amy Covid Barrett) is the kickoff for similar madness as what OP mentioned.
20139,It's a rising wave.
20140,In America unlikely to have government vaccine mandate for everyone.
20141,Not just US most of the country are still suffering
20142,"Hello, neighbor!"
20143,"Kids around here that are in hybrid dont have “after school” but another district in my city has not re-opened at all, but things like sports continue."
20144,So bizarre.
20145,Willingness to act for the best interest of everyone in society is weakness?
20146,"You are happy that 225,,000 US citizens have died to protect your ""freedom""?"
20147,though some places are definitely in a second wave
20148,"
&gt;If we were on the 420th wave **weed** have confidence that our actions are appropriate

DANK

Also, our health care system would be sucking dick if we got to wave 69."
20149,it's spreading fast.
20150,Ffs.
20151,"I'm a psychologist who works in an acute psych ward, and also does private practice."
20152,Mental health has definitely suffered unfortunately
20153,"As I said before, please educate yourself."
20154,"This is good news, but it is absolutely devastating to have lost a total of 800 lives in our state since this began."
20155,"Thank you to the Andrews government for getting this thing back under control, although it doesn't mean we should be ignoring what caused this terrible second wave to begin with."
20156,Is it just blind faith if people  have t cell immunity or has it been shown people have it?
20157,"&gt;	I genuinely hate to say it about my fellow country men and women

No you don’t."
20158,I mean he should be fine just like Alan Colmes.
20159,"Please God, do not let it come to this here."
20160,"I do not believe it will, but I also see the strain on our healthcare system."
20161,I see field hospitals in the near future.
20162,God it's the anti lottery.
20163,No one wants to be the winner.
20164,"From an April study: "" The virus is highly stable at 4°C, but sensitive to heat."
20165,"At 4°C, there  was only around a 0·7 log-unit reduction of infectious titre on day 14."
20166,"With the incubation temperature increased to 70°C, the time for virus inactivation was reduced to 5 mins.  """
20167,Really informative stuff...despite the visit from Negative Nancy at the end.
20168,Why so intent on undermining Dr. Fauci's message?
20169,"Holy shit, wishing you and POland luck in handling this."

20229,I don’t think lower death rate will last.
20230,Deaths are still lagging hospitalizations.
20231,You’re right though.
20232,We have learned so much about the virus and the stages of illness so treatment is much better.
20233,Maybe I’m too pessimistic.
20234,Still way too many people dying.
20235,"The problem was, at least here in Michigan (US), the stores that sold nothing but batteries or hair supplies or flowers or candy all started freaking out last March because they were shut down yet big superstores like Meijer &amp; Walmart continued to sell batteries, hair supplies, flowers, &amp; candy."

20293,"Last thing we need is something wild like a major complication to this and the virus somehow overtakes a vaccinated host, or was that crazy talk?"

20299,We just got hit at my house.
20300,Fingers crossed we escape with only mild or asymptotic cases.
20301,They are talking about people over 60.
20302,I agree it’s ridiculous to think all these people can be protected.
20303,It’s not like 90 year olds.
20304,That's good.
20305,Keep it going nice and steady.
20306,Focused protection doesn’t if you...don’t bother to do it.
20307,&gt;That follows a familiar pattern.
20308,"Cases generally rise first among highly social young people, including recently returning college students."
20309,"Then, they slowly bubble up among older demographics, in part through multigenerational housing and other interactions."
20310,An analysis published in the CDC’s Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report last month found that increasing infections among younger adults were generally followed by upticks in the 60-plus demographic in the same area from four to 15 days later.
20311,No one is surprised by this.
20312,Why were the AZ trials paused in the US for so long?
20313,Will that affect us getting access to this vaccine?
20314,Do we have to for US trials?
20315,"As a student at one of the top colleges in the country, it is a mess."
20316,Some teachers don’t know how to teach on Zoom.
20317,It’s hard to grasp certain concepts without the in person aspect or extra help.
20318,The lack of relationships being made can be depressing and overwhelming.
20319,"I agree that distance learning is not a replacement and is what we’re doing for the moment, but it definitely isn’t good and is very chaotic."
20320,And this is coming from someone who’s always been a 4.0 student.
20321,"As a nursing major, some of the concepts I’m learning need to be taught in person but are being taught online which is not feasible whatsoever."
20322,I have two elementary aged siblings and one of them was just bawling their eyes out because they are struggling with online learning (has also always been a straight A student) and hates not seeing their friends.
20323,They now have a therapist for depression.
20324,And my other sibling isn’t doing too much better.
20325,Let’s not even get into the other attributes like those students who don’t get to eat each day because school food was their only meals.
20326,Students who are in abusive households and don’t have school as an escape anymore.
20327,Special educated students who are now falling even further behind because they’re not thoroughly understanding online education.
20328,There’s so many pieces to this puzzle.
20329,"At the end of the day, in person education needs to be a priority."
20330,States and the government need to do what they can to get students safely back in classrooms where they can properly learn.
20331,"To you, it may not be a big deal that millions of students are missing “a year or so” of a quality education."
20332,"But to students struggling in whatever way, especially low income students, this year of education means the world to them and will affect them for many years to come."
20333,"Edit: But for the most part, I do agree with most of what you said."
20334,It just needs to be a bigger priority to get students back to in person that’s all.
20335,I think a lot of people on the sub don’t care about this subject because it doesn’t necessarily regard them.
20336,They had their time in school.
20337,They don’t have children.
20338,They’re grown adults.
20339,They think that people dying from the virus directly is the only negative of our current situation.
20340,They overall don’t care that the children being neglected are the future.
20341,"And them not experiencing a pandemic that disrupted their whole education and social growth, makes it hard for them to relate."
20342,"&gt;**The fall was greater** in those over 65, compared with younger age groups, and **in those without symptoms compared with those with full-blown Covid-19."
20343,"**  
&gt;  
&gt;**The number of healthcare workers with antibodies remained relatively high**, which the researchers suggest may be due to regular exposure to the virus."
20344,So mild exposure isn't enough.

20350,We're not monkeys.
20351,We have developed the ability to discuss multiple topics at once and analyze their nuances.
20352,"Maybe you don't care, but some people do."
20353,I promise you it won't make them forget that we have a pandemic going on.
20354,Damn.
20355,Imagine not even being able to add a small detail to a topic without people getting annoyed that you mentioned one semantic detail that was more of a side-note.
20356,"And in science, semantics are important."
20357,"Insulin, for example, isn't all *just insulin*."
20358,"Some have faster peak times, some slower."
20359,Those acting waves matter in how they're administered.
20360,"Sometimes details are something good to look at, but I promise it won't derail from the major topic."
20361,They aren't that different.
20362,"If you have widespread community transmission thats the same as not having it under control, therefore your borders being closed will not solve that problem."
20363,"&gt;I've repeatedly pointed out that my country is an example of one where border controls do work in cases of ""widespread community transmission"", when suppression measures are implemented."
20364,No you country is an example of good lockdown measures to stop the spread within.
20365,You will never be able to control domestic spread with border closures.
20366,That's the problem it solves.
20367,Border controls do nothing against community transmission because community transmission happens within the fucking border.
20368,There are two separate issues.
20369,Foreign spread and domestic spread.
20370,"When you have 52k new cases, less than 1% of those are coming from abroad."
20371,Therefore your main concern is stopping community spread.
20372,A few people coming from abroad are drops in a fucking ocean.
20373,"Closing your borders will not solve the issue they face, bringing it up is a red herring."
20374,&gt;How many times have I said that border controls along with suppression measures within a country are necessary?
20375,And how many times do I have to fucking tell you most of these countries are not worried about foreign travel right now or also have their fucking borders closed already.
20376,Closing borders is not a solution for the state these countries are in right now.
20377,It will do absolutely nothing to help them in the state they are in right now.
20378,This entire conversation is irrelevant for multiple reasons.
20379,The main one being most countries do in fact have their borders closed.
20380,The second being the issues they face presently will not be solved by stricter border controls.
20381,"If you cannot fathom that most countries are dealing with domestic spread right now, and border closures do nothing to prevent domestic spread, then you are beyond useless to this conversation."
20382,And don't talk of poor reading comprehension when you aren't even competent enough to understand what border controls are effective at fighting.
20383,Right now what France needs is significant lockdown measures.
20384,Border closures wont help them in the slightest since their cases aren't coming from abroad.
20385,"That doesn't make border closures useless, but it makes them irrelevant to this conversation."
20386,The fact you are so mind numbingly incompetent to be unable to see the point I am making is truly a sight to behold.
20387,I mean we're practically agreeing but you seem to think borders are like 50% of the solution.
20388,"All the other measures like mask wearing, social distancing, closure of non essential business, are the *vast* majority of the fight against covid."
20389,Closing the boders would have such a tiny fucking effect on these countries it's not even worth bringing up.
20390,"Not because it will have zero overall effect, but because it's useless to those countries right now."
20391,When you talk about border closures being miraculously effective and then add all the other measures that are actually doing the legwork as some fucking afterthought you're empowering dumbasses who think closing the border is all you need to do.
20392,That's how this entire conversation started.
20393,"Somebody suggesting borders should be closed, on a thread about France have 52k *domestic* cases."
20394,That is pointless to the conversation of how to curb the spread in those countries.
20395,"Yes of course it has some merit, but that merit doesn't magically make it even remotely as relevant as other measures which are exponentially more important and should be talked about instead."
20396,That's the interest rate.
20397,Look at the price of the bonds themselves in the market.
20398,TLT is a good starting point.
20399,"I am an introvert and have social anxiety and though, not gunna lie, I have really been doing better without having to go to public crowded places, even I, the hermit, have reached the point of cabin fever."
20400,"It is really upsetting to me though that I have been extremely cautious about everything and doing my part since March.. 8 months and because so many people have adamantly refused to even attempt to give a shit,  it feels like this isolation is seriously never going to end"
20401,There is no evidence (yet) that people are losing antibodies for the virus.
20402,"So when a commercial test comes up negative, it's an issue with the test not being 'sensitive' enough to detect them."
20403,What might interest you are T cell tests.
20404,"Very expensive, but very enlightening."
20405,"If you have T cells that respond to coronaviruses (via antibodies), you're immunue."

20412,Yes short term pain for long term gain!
20413,"&gt;You mean like how white people get shot more than black people by police

This is false."
20414,Comparing how many or how often white people are killed by police to how many or how often black people are killed by the police is statistically dubious unless you first adjust for population.
20415,"According to the most recent census data, there are nearly 160 million more white people in America than there are black people."
20416,White people make up roughly 62% of the U.S. population but only about 49% of those who are killed by police officers.
20417,"Black Americans, however, account for 24% of those fatally shot and killed by the police despite being just 13% of the U.S. population."
20418,That means Black Americans are 2.5 times as likely as White Americans to be killed by the police.
20419,Just go ahead and stop talking if you’re going to say stupid things.

20432,"The swab can often fail to pick up virus material in an infected person, this is called a false negative."
20433,"Immediately after infection, the virus has not had time to replicate itself up the airway, so the swab will absolutely fail to find it, and this means a false negative rate of 100%."
20434,"The test gradually become more reliable over time, but even at the best of times, it can fail to pick up an infection about 20% of the time."
20435,"Therefore, the swabs can only tell if you are infected, they can never tell that your are healthy."

20674,"2 days ago I saw a comment with 150 upvotes claiming that the rise in cases in the US was to blame on the ""optimism"" in this sub."
20675,Apparently optimism and not rushing on to catastrophic conclusions that may not be real makes this virus stronger.
20676,Maybe it’ll imbue Heroes style super powers to some.
20677,Or maybe I’ll grant those super powers to all the various diseases we’re fighting and we’ll get COVID-25
20678,Of course they did.
20679,"Whenever I see comments like this, I always ask the person how in the world they imagine China has had community transmission for the past six months while everyone is back to work and returned to normal and yet they don't have exponential growth, and massive waves of patients at hospitals?"
20680,What is the magic you think China has?
20681,"Electricity usage is back to normal levels, air pollution is back, traffic is back, exports are at all time record highs."
20682,How do you imagine all of this is possible while community transmission is still occurring and somehow hidden?
20683,Your can't hide a pandemic.
20684,"If there was *any* community transmission that wasn't being contact traced and isolated, very quickly there would be enormous outbreaks impossible to hide."
20685,This is exactly what they are.

20695,who knew that being a dumbass was so easy?
20696,"Yep and sky news further advocating for metal health which is good, but where was this before the lockdowns?"
20697,We can clearly see it’s agenda driven from the Murdoch media.
20698,I always thought it should be Richard.

20700,Shame that our inept politicians are not using the pandemic to destroy teachers unions.

20702,Start from scratch with 100% private schooling.
20703,Thank you.
20704,I tend to believe that people who minimize the effects of the virus are poorly informed or unable to confront what their fellow humans are facing.
20705,"If all else fails, I call to mind what I consider to be an American of average intelligence and then remind myself that 50% of them are dumber than that."
20706,I don’t think that the sacrifices that were made to slow the virus were for nothing.
20707,The problem of demonstrating success of a venture that prevents something from happening is that opponents of the venture will deny that it had anything to do with the prevalence of what was meant to be stopped.
20708,"If the US hadn’t taken the inadequately rigorous and too short ‘quasi-shutdown’, the current escalation in cases would have started with a higher number of infections, which would likely mean that we would have been in our current miserable position sooner and now we would be in a bigger mess."
20709,The way most US states approached their so-called ‘lock downs’ underdelivered on slowing the spread of the virus.
20710,"That gives politicians cover to reject a second, proper lockdown (fewer people allowed to leave home and only near home for an hour or two, comprehensive testing with rapid results, prompt contact tracing and enforced quarantine) by saying that the undeniably high economic cost of the earlier ‘lockdown’ was not justified."
20711,"The result will be half a million dead by February, and many, many more sickened."
20712,Some will have long lasting (possibly permanent impairments).
20713,"The higher number of cases will worsen the hammering the economy is taking - especially as news and images emerge of overwhelmed hospitals, people being triaged and left to die, refrigerated trucks storing bodies and mass graves."
20714,"We got a glimpse of it in New York, which has resources and will to beat back the infection."
20715,Now a majority of states are on the cusp of that situation.
20716,"Many lack the resources,
will and know-how to mitigate the situation materially."
20717,"To scrape through in April, New York relied on a huge number of traveling doctors, nurses and techs."
20718,Those resources are now wanted in most states.
20719,"There are hospitals in Texas currently bidding $4,500 per week plus accommodation to nurses."
20720,"At the same time, some hospital personnel are falling victim to the infection and others are becoming too burned out to work."
20721,"The next six to nine months are going to be harrowing - assuming at least a couple of vaccines are demonstrated safe and effective by the end of the year, manufacturing, shipping and storage get worked out, people trust them enough to ensure adequate numbers are vaccinated and serious side effects don’t arise months after vaccination and immunity lasts for at least months."
20722,If all of those stars align we may have sufficient  population immunity to resume something like normal life.
20723,That also presupposes that we figure out a way to pay people thrown out of work enough for them to avoid destitution and the companies that employed them do not go under.
20724,Yes... and we also have public health laws that punish people who negligently put other people's lives at risk.
20725,Why do you think countries like South Korea dealt with their outbreaks so quickly.
20726,"Government control isn't just a dog-whistle for 'socialism', ya know."
20727,Wasn’t Canada doing really well not so long ago?
20728,"Maybe I am just confused, sorry to hear of your predicament, Aussie here."

20730,Thats true for infected as well though.
20731,You can't compere verified infected vs believed reinfections.
20732,Even _scary_ is extremely subjective.
20733,Does anyone know the survival percentage of covid?
20734,I looked it up and it said only 2% of the people who have had it died.
20735,Is that true?
20736,"We’re last, which means we’re first!"
20737,I live in Georgia dropped my wallet outside of a froyo place and someone mailed it back to me with everything still inside.
20738,And never ever will since it was already out of control like 3 months before the lockdown.
20739,It was endemic before the fight started
20740,&gt;It creates the impression that 59 were infected on the plane.
20741,"But there were only 13 cases on the plane

20757,You don’t catch a virus (cold/sniffles) from cold weather.
20758,"That’s an old wives’ tale, lol."
20759,Yeah I have pandemic fatigue because Im getting sick and tired of no one doing their part by wearing a damn mask.
20760,Im fatigued because I worry about my families health because I can only control what we do put not what others do to protect us.

20767,"You might  be right, it's just that when average american wants to go to hospital for help they'd ask someone to take them to ER while Poles go to SOR."
20768,If hospital staff asks patients to avoid their SOR theyd probably mean ER if it was usa.
20769,Because masks don't work nearly as well as they want you to think.
20770,"&gt;even if I was exposed , viral load would likely be drastically lower

Thats what I go for."
20771,I haven't flown since march but I take the NYC subway every day and I just try and be as sanitary as possible but not worry that I'm not 100% secure.

20827,The vast majority of people who graduate end up in service jobs using a fraction of what they 'learned' in school.
20828,Yet we still choose to force them through classes they don't give any shits about in the vain hope that they will change.

20838,"However, middle and high school students who have chosen to slack off, not log in, and not participate in school at all since going remote were already wasting their education before this change."

20890,So they are having do 3x as much work to trace contacts of 1 infected person.

20932,"The 3m seals even with somewhat of short stubble (though I'd probably still fail a work safe air leak test) You can also get full face ones, but the price jumps 4x (atleast around here) alot of the tradie focused and ""mum and pop"" style hardware/tool stores are probably the best place to find them, but you will pay 10-20% more than the big box hardware stores."
20933,"But again, this is in Australia, so we're not exactly ground zero over here."
20934,"Yet even during the Hight of our panic buying, spikes and mask shortages I was still astounded to see them in stock, despite some people buying boxes of 50 surgical masks for $50-150 a box."
20935,"I would, but the US has fucked up the COVID response so badly that the vast majority of the world won't let Americans in."
20936,"You should also ask someone to help you look up the word ""responsibility"" since you seem to be totally unfamiliar with the concept."

20938,"It is probably closer to 0.5-0.2% mortality rate, numbers tend to look inflated because not all countries test and count number of cases in the same manner."
20939,But it is better to look at age graphs as in many countries large percentage of deaths occurred in hospices or retirement homes.
20940,"Overall, it is not just a flu, but it is not a black death either."
20941,It is really surprising how many people thing in those 2 extremes though now we have huge amout of information about it.

20949,It's literally been the top article on the BBC all day.
20950,It's straight up misinformation.
20951,I would have thought if immunity was only a few months we would have tens of thousands of reinfection stories by now already.
20952,Not a handful.
20953,Yup.
20954,Funny how most people are more concerned with comfort and appearance.
20955,Makes sense given the number of cases ...
20956,You are in no way better.

20966,lol wut who said anything about Nazis?
20967,To ignore that the initial blame is on China is what’s stupid.
20968,All the other world leaders are being held accountable but everyone’s just ignoring that the CCP inflicted this on the world.
20969,They should be demanding reparations.
20970,every school that opens in my area closes back down in a week or so due to infections.
20971,"personally I feel that the yo-yo of remote to face to face every couple weeks is bad for the kids, it sucks that they can't be in school but consistency might be be better."
20972,also we need to remember that even if the kids aren't showing direct symptoms covid can be creating effects that will last well after.
20973,"Like I said, enjoy staying in and living in fear."
20974,That’s no one else’s problem but your own.

20984,Probably not but who knows?
20985,So we know for certain that China isn't running vaccine trials inside China?
20986,"So sad... Off topic question tho, what is the appropriate response to a post like this?"
20987,Upvote or downvote?
20988,You know?
20989,Cause its depressing as fuck but it's not really a bad post either.
20990,True.
20991,Do you notice any ironic in you guys calling me hostile and unpleasant yet refusing to engage at all in what I've said and simply insulting me?
20992,"The point of what I was saying is allowing yourself to be manipulated by propaganda like this means that you will simply 'Other' other people and feel free to dismiss their opinions without rational thought because they're assholes and then there we go,  divide-and-conquer everyone who doesn't agree with me is a Nazi."
20993,"Well done,  carry on."
20994,Not true the entire aircrafts air is replaced in matter of minutes and there is HEPA filtration

21001,"Crazy smart, yea .."
21002,The bias is saying that a vaccine isn’t safe simply because Trump says it is.
21003,That’s this whole thread.
21004,You can’t get to Trump pushing an unsafe vaccine without career scientists pushing an unsafe vaccine.
21005,I wasn't aware that snowstorms are caused by people driving on roads and opening the roads too much will cause the snow to return.
21006,Closing the streets in time will prevent people from being caught in a blizzard.
21007,"If you close them while the blizzard is happening, you'll have to send rescue workers out and endanger their lives, too."
21008,"The difference is: You could put up a sign saying ""Blizzard is coming, if you still go, you're on your own""."
21009,Yeah.

21044,"Belgium so far has 330k confirmed cases, with 14k cases per day, and a population of 11.5M."
21045,"If we assume herd immunity is reached at 8.6M cases, we would need to see a further 8.3M cases, or nearly 600 days at the current rate."
21046,"We are however seeing massive growth of probably 60% per week, and there is significant under-testing."
21047,"We therefore need either to maintain the growth rate, or assume under-testing of at least 4:1 with a 20% weekly growth rate, to hit those absurd numbers."
21048,But if those are the rates: it's going to be a bloodbath.

21056,It's going to be a brutal wake up call.
21057,"Not for the generations that caused it though, because they'll be dead by then"
21058,Note that P100 filters are only rated as such when worn with a full face mask (read 3M specs).
21059,"With a half face mask they are not rated P100, since the half face mask has quite a bit of leakage even when properly fit."
21060,"K, are they going to test the other half?"
21061,I think the only thing that they could have been done better was to keep high schools and maybe middle schools from distance.
21062,"I don't see a possible solution for elementary and kindergarten, when the possibility of keeping them closed arose all the parents started protesting (with reason imo)."
21063,Probably what the governments got from the data of March/April was that young people were harder to infect (?)
21064,"so they took their decision, because i don't see any other reasons."
21065,Just approve it already!
21066,!
21067,"You're down voted, but it is halffff true."
21068,half of it is on the people in certain area's of the world.
21069,"American with their freedum attitude, the UK with their arrogant and selfish take on it, and so on."
21070,But also it's on the government of those places to govern... Groups of people are fucking stupid.
21071,Individuals can be smart.
21072,"We needed leadership to limit the groups stupidity, not add to it."
21073,Stupid people with stupid leadership = what we have now.
21074,"(Ok arguing with myself here, but.)"
21075,I think that the most scary real-world sign that immunity doesnt last is that Belgium for example was one of the worst hit countries during the spring.
21076,And now the cases are though the roof again.
21077,Shouldnt the immunity stop that partially?
21078,"But maybe it did, are there any signs/studies of that."
21079,Maybe its other areas/cities being hit.
21080,"Kudos Victoria and keep up the good practices, maybe it'll rub off on other countries, way to go!"
21081,Is everyone antimaskers in sweden?
21082,As a swede myself i figured it’s about norms.
21083,"I dont think they’re anti it, just comfortable and because barely no one wears it you dont wear it yourself."
21084,"I’m not sure what they would say now but i remember they said you should be cautious with masks because it can make people touch their face more and also the fact that it can make people go ”well if i wear a mask then everything is fine” and you let down your guard regarding distancing so ultimately they focused on encouraging people to krep distance and keep clean, but of course masks are still a good thing."
21085,"But yeah i mean, i live in a college city and there are a lot of parties and people sitting in restaurants n stuff, i don’t think young people think that much about it unfortunately atleast in terms of my city"
21086,Yup.
21087,Really wish there was some magic wand we could wave to see how many people ACTUALLY had it at any point in time.
21088,"
&gt;Haha you're confusing overloaded terms with the weird idea that mathematics apply in different ways to different fields."

21091,"US has even managed to fuck it up in Hawaii, which has every geographic advantage, being an island in a warm climate."
21092,Attempting*
21093,What are other indicators of immunity?
21094,They wear face masks.
21095,Honestly how is this still a discussion?
21096,Corona is not going away.
21097,Like all viruses it will not just perish just because a country locks down or wears masks etc ...
21098,Poland locked down early and hard.
21099,Closed borders early.
21100,But for the second wave they've switched strategy and are now much looser.
21101,I don't buy the travel patterns thing.
21102,There are huge numbers of Poles across Europe who travel back and forth.
21103,The reduced numbers came from government action.
21104,So why the change in attitude from the gov?
21105,I think it's all down to the election.
21106,They locked down hard to win the election.
21107,Now the election is done they are protecting business interests over the people.

The problem is that last week i brought some identical cool masks and gave one to my mum who was happy to wear them."
21110,"On friday, she took my car, (she ususally never do that) and i had left my mask there."
21111,"I was wearing this mask the day before (thursday) i don't kniw what series of bad luck played, but she mistook my mask for hers, she wore it!"
21112,For a good hour i think.
21113,She realized her mistake when she eventually saw her mask in her bag.
21114,My mum has an auto immune disease and take some lowering immunity drug.
21115,"I feel so angry and sad and guilty

As a summary."
21116,I was wearing a mask on thursday.
21117,My mum wore the same mask friday.

&gt;&gt;Prevention of infection is *not* a criterion for success for any of these vaccines."
21149,"In fact, their endpoints all require confirmed infections and all those they will include in the analysis for success,  the only difference being the severity of symptoms between the vaccinated and unvaccinated."
21150,"Measuring differences amongst only those infected by SARS-CoV-2 underscores the implicit conclusion that the vaccines are not expected to prevent infection, only modify symptoms of those infected."
21151,That's how immunity she vaccination works.
21152,"It doesn't build a forcefield around the body keeping a pathogen out, it lets your body clear it quickly once it gets in."

21165,I recently got Drager X-Plore 3500 with P3 (EU P100 filters) and I have to say the fit and comfort is leagues beyond anything I’ve worn over these past months.
21166,"If the 3M halfmasks are anything like that, just get yourself some eye protection and you’re all set."
21167,N95/FFP2s are still more convenient for flying in case you have to identify yourself at passport controls.
21168,"As for Airnium, I don’t know anything about them."

21170,"Some people just want it to be over, safely or otherwise."
21171,"Whether you agree with them or not, governments have to develop policies that acknowledge that they exist and that compliance is becoming difficult to secure."
21172,"If that means enforcement, or some deliberate slack in the system so that people don't take the view that they may as well be hanged for a sheep as a lamb, or probably some combination, then so be it."
21173,You mean only 2/3 of excess deaths were tested for covid.
21174,It's most likely that roughly all of them were caused by COVID infections.
21175,"For instance the single largest number are the 10,000 non-covid- tested excess deaths in Florida,  many of which were caused by pneumonia."
21176,"There are certainly positive collateral deaths,  although I've yet to see a single provable example."
21177,There are also negative collateral deaths (reduced numbers of accidental deaths).
21178,It's not really worth arguing about because there is no good science on this.
21179,"We as a country do not appear interested to find out what killed those 100,000 people or stopping it."
21180,"Frankly I take this as evidence that they're probably caused by infection,  but you could argue the other way too."
21181,how did you grow up in ohio and not know it’s a tourist destination?
21182,"sandusky is less than an hour from where you grew up and is home to one of the most famous amusement parks in the world, Cedar Point."
21183,"thousands of people come there to work every summer, including many international workers; there are enough transient employees that they have dorm housing for them."
21184,people come from all over the world for that park.
21185,"in addition to that, the coast of lake erie is incredibly popular with domestic tourism."
21186,"there are sandy beaches, water sports (parasailing, jet skiing, etc), ferries the lake erie islands, kalahari (the largest indoor water park in the country)... and this is all just one small city."

21399,"Also, if it's such a risk then maybe, just maybe, it was not a good idea to tell your puppet constitutional court to rule on this case at this time?"
21400,It doesn't take a genius to figure out that banning abortion will spark massive protests.
21401,I remember an article suggesting BLM protests actually reduced Covid-19 rates.
21402,How does this differ?
21403,"So the data monitoring board does not get the data right away (I am almost sure they are not in charge of the analysis, rather they are in charge of validating the analysis), Pfizer/BionTech still have to do the un-blinding and make all the required analysis to hand over to them."
21404,"Once they have that data, they should in theory be able to see if the analysis matches the raw data and take a short time."
21405,But the time needed for the FDA required analysis and un-blinding is still there.
21406,They can't even start to un-blind until they hit 32.

21433,A lot of the stuff they did needs to be done very early and many Western countries twiddled their thumbs instead of getting ahead of the virus.
21434,Certain things that worked well in places like Taiwan simply aren't feasible at this point in other parts of the world where the virus is surging.
21435,"&gt;Either way, it's not that bad people are making it out to be

21438,"That said, about 8,000 people die in the US each day."
21439,"A large proportion of them don't need much care (they have a sudden heart attack, die in their sleep, etc.)."
21440,Some will linger for days or months.
21441,"But if you add a thousand or two respiratory deaths to the mix, as well as all the serious cases that don't become fatal, that requires resources that basically don't exist."
21442,"With that in mind, you could easily end up with a couple of million deaths."

21448,"There hasn't hardly been shit for lockdowns except maybe ""go to the drive through or curbside pickup"" ... the economy is suffering and people are losing their jobs due to a lack of spending because consumer confidence is in the toilet and no one wants to dine in with high viral loads in the environment."

21451,If they wanted my money in the economy they could have been decent human beings.
21452,"Businesses are not charities, they do not staff when they aren't making sales or they go under."
21453,"There was a homicide in my city the other day in a fairly affluent neighborhood, the news crew waited for 2 hours for someone to go into the restaurant across the street to get feedback on how it made them feel, but no one even tried to go into the very open restaurant in 2 hours."
21454,That place was packed all the time before the virus started to spread.
21455,"That's not the government, that's the people that caused that."
21456,If they would have just been reasonable and followed the public health advisor's suggestions we wouldn't have gotten the cases we did and we wouldn't have people nervous of picking up a gallon of milk.
21457,That's just simply not true.
21458,Maybe at a national level but something like 80% of the country locked down in various forms for the better part of April and May.
21459,We also shut down foreign travel before anyone else and were widely mocked by the EU for it even though they quickly followed suite.
21460,Yes our lock downs and mask mandates were handled at a state level but that is how the US operates.
21461,Our states have greater say over what they do then most other countries.
21462,"Im so sick of seeing all these ""antibodies go away after a few months AAAAHHHH"" articles."

21465,"You don’t want just one article that says one thing, you want multiple talking points with sources."
21466,Not many countries have this available to them as they only really have one prominent news source.
21467,And at this point what even are the odds of finding a covid patient from January
21468,good question - you'd have to check how many IU are in the multivit.
21469,There usually isn't enough of it in there (usually like 400-800 IU).
21470,"If there's a small amount, there's nothing wrong with taking an extra 3000iu, you can buy vitamin d in 1000iu capsules, and take some supplemental Mg based on how much their is in the multivitamin."
21471,The other thing is to consider what form the vitamins in your multivit are.
21472,If any of them are oxides or chelates they aren't as bioavailable as things like picolinate or citrates.
21473,Just something to consider.
21474,The reason they use not-as-bioavailable forms is bc it's sadly cheaper to make a multivit out of those forms than the better ones your body has an easier time handling.
21475,Why assume it's limited to testing on site when the video says the plan is to require that the passenger be tested within 72 hours of boarding?
21476,^^Unless ^^you ^^didn't ^^watch ^^the ^^video ^^shockedpikachu.jpg

21489,&gt; Maybe for Ebola you can call that standard!
21490,Negative.
21491,Ebola is not a respiratory virus.
21492,Ebola is actually more difficult to transmit as it requires contact with bodily fluids.

21495,Based on what?
21496,Don’t know overdose on anything!
21497,Yeah my point ins more than attributing it to the deadliness of the virus itself might not be accurate until we have a better pocture from the data
21498,Assholes tend to think the world cares about their opinion.
21499,...wait a minute...
21500,I am following your logic there.
21501,You know those are ratios not percentages right?
21502,"If you’re going to cite IFR as a percentage, use a source that presents it in that format:

21506,so can we.
21507,numbers of users are going up
21508,Optimistic but WA state is currently investigating 100+ cases of possible reinfection.
21509,"Now vaccines are carefully made to try and induce a robust response as possible, in a more consistent manner than natural infection."
21510,So there is hope there.
21511,We will know more when we get to the third stage vaccine reviews.
21512,[deleted]
21513,Of course.
21514,But in general that's counteracted by FAR less people being in public.
21515,"Again, it's a general opinion of people as a whole, not a form rule."
21516,"It could be 92/8 or 86/14 of any given sample, but as a whole I still believe 90/10 is generally true."
21517,People are probably downvoting you because you don't understand the difference between a probability and a percentage.
21518,"Look at it in a logarithmic plot, if the graph is linear there, then it’s exponential growth."
21519,"I have a home-made one that I spray with Lysol in between uses, and I wash it with soap every week."
21520,Its foolish to expect similar results despite obviously different situations.
21521,I don't think China is a fair comparison for US similar to how I don't think it would be fair to compare them to France or Spain or Germany.
21522,This is literally insane.
21523,There's no way this is even feasible.
21524,900k-1 million people are flying every day right now.
21525,"If they tested negative 4 days before flying, who cares."
21526,They easily could have caught it in those 4 days.
21527,What if you're flying back from somewhere?
21528,Do you just stop by the day you get there and get swapped and hope the results come back before your flight home?
21529,What if you have a weekend business trip and you fly out 48 hours later?
21530,Or 24?

21557,I was wearing masks in NYC in March and was afraid of people freaking out about it.
21558,Several people got angry and yelled or ran away shouting that I was diseased.
21559,"Dude, you're safer around me in an n95 than all those unmasked people you ran into trying to get away from me."
21560,Masks made people irrationally angry in the early days.
21561,It somehow made them feel severe cognitive dissonance and they lashed out at mask wearers because of it.
21562,I think they wanted to stay in denial of coronavirus and my mask contradicted that.
21563,My mask scared them because they were not wearing one and thus they were unprotected thus lashing out of me for this unpleasant realization...
21564,I mean...the mind boggles.
21565,I'm afraid of ever leaving NYC because so many people still don't wear masks and wearing one may put you in danger if you meet the wrong Neanderthal.

21594,Huh yeah ok
21595,It's concerning.
21596,This coronavirus evolved in bats which rely on antibodies more than t cell response for fighting viral infections.
21597,So it stands to assume coronavirus has some tricks up it's sleeves.
21598,Those who get the sickest fail to mount a proper t cell response.
21599,those with robust t cell response have good outcomes.
21600,Some people have genetic abnormalities that prevent them from mounting a strong antiviral t cell response.
21601,This is weird for a virus because most vaccines target inducing a strong b cell/antibody response.
21602,Of course this can be tailored but historically we've worked on vaccines inducing antibodies and we've focused on that response as opposed to t cell.
21603,It's likely some vaccines won't work well and some people might just not be able to mount a protective response based on a vaccine.
21604,I am cautiously optimistic.

21631,"As soon as the US heard about COVID, they should've worked their asses off to get testing available to people immediately instead of discouraging testing (thanks Trump)."
21632,COVID related healthcare costs should've been made free so the uninsured don't have to worry about paying $100 for a fucking test or not being able to afford hospital bills.
21633,"More money should've been thrown at hospitals, hospital workers, and hospital equipment."
21634,No reason why people should be dying because there's not enough ventilators going around.
21635,There should've been a strict lockdown policy and country/state borders should've been closed.
21636,Access could've been allowed on a case by case basis after mandatory testing and enforced solo quarantining while a person waits for their test results.

21644,The preventive costs would've been way cheaper than dealing with the aftermath now (e.g.

22036,&gt;Something as obvious as saying different countries are not the same is so mind blowingly obvious that asking for a source is like asking for a paper proving that water is wet.
22037,"&gt;Now if experts are comparing the countries, so be it."
22038,We are not.
22039,"https://www.google.dk/amp/s/theconversation.com/amp/coronavirus-why-the-nordics-are-our-best-bet-for-comparing-strategies-135344

Yes, experts are comparing countries in Scandinavia."
22040,"In many different studies, and specifically in case of the Coronavirus."
22041,This source right here tells you that the countries are comparable enough that the different outcomes will be due to differences in strategy.
22042,"No, they are not 100% comparable."
22043,Two different Swedish cities are not 100% comparable.
22044,But the differences are small enough that experts confidently say that we can use the different results directly.
22045,That’s a fact.
22046,That’s what I’ve been saying all along.
22047,&gt;Prioritising those with a good chance of survival does not equal a collapse.
22048,"If you want to make this about the definition of what a failure would be go ahead, but you have not proven anything."
22049,You did not ask me if the system collapsed.
22050,You asked me if it failed.
22051,"And it did - it failed it’s population by completely overestimating the need for triage, and refusing to adjust."
22052,"This led to hundreds, if not thousands, dying completely needlessly."
22053,I’ve sent you proof of that.
22054,"You want to call that not a failure, that’s on you."
22055,But saying “well the system didn’t collapse because we just let people die in their homes instead of in hospital beds” sure doesn’t sound like something that you should be proud of.
22056,"&gt;Again, it is impossible to be unaffected, but Sweden was among the least."
22057,About tied with denmark ending up in 3rd by a 0.1% difference.
22058,In comparison to Europe it is far better.
22059,"Yes, about tied with Denmark."
22060,Who has one fifth the deaths per capita.
22061,Does that sound good to you?
22062,"You know the lockdown was to prevent deaths, right?"
22063,The economic damage is a consequence of the attempt to save lives.
22064,So same damage and way more deaths is a terrible outcome.
22065,Why do you believe it isn’t?
22066,"&gt;If there is an actual scientific analysis you have, use that instead."
22067,You are a layman and your analysis is absolutely worthless to me.
22068,What I am saying and has consistently said is that due to the major differences in the societies a 1:1 comparison is worthless.
22069,"As noted above, that’s just one scientific analysis."
22070,I’ve from the start said this is what people who actually know something are saying.
22071,"I’ve never claimed it’s my baseless opinion, but I can see why you would think that."
22072,"After all, so far you’ve sent me absolutely no evidence in favour of your opinion."
22073,Makes sense that you would think I’m the same.
22074,But I’m really not.
22075,A 100% comparison is impossible.
22076,"Yet experts are saying that between Sweden, Norway and Finland, the huge differences in outcome are due to the differences in strategy."
22077,Not me.
22078,Experts are saying that.
22079,&gt;Because failure and success should not be purely based on the rest of the world.
22080,"When we are comparing which strategy was the best, of course it should."
22081,Would you still say the strategy was a success if there were zero deaths in all other countries?
22082,"&gt;For example, Finland had more than 12 times the amount of deaths of New Zealand, does that make Finland a failure?"
22083,You will be hard pressed to find two countries that are less comparable than Finland and New Zealand.
22084,"Are you suggesting that, if I should be allowed to compare Sweden to Norway, then it would be the same as comparing Finland to New Zealand?"
22085,"We’ve seen this headline every week, but those who don’t want to wear masks will not listen to strangers."
22086,It’s going to take a death of a loved one.
22087,It was mostly caused by a global pandemic that has fucked up most of the world.
22088,"Mistakes were made in good faith trying to fix that, but no government came into this thing really knowing what to do."

22137,That anyone thinks vaccine development and deployment with covidis simple or guaranteed is foolish.
22138,We need a multi-pronged approach and nothing should be off that table in how to handle it.

22173,The initial official numbers from China are still suspect.
22174,But I have no doubt that the number of *new* officially reported cases and deaths since March or April are reasonably accurate.

22199,"In the EU, they got cases down to a super low level, then failed at every one of those steps, all while people let their guard down."
22200,Now the current surge is catastrophic.
22201,"We will see what happens this time around, but looking at what happened in the US in July, I am hoping we are able to make the same smallish corrections (closing down indoor dining and gyms, reiterating discouragement of informal indoor gatherings) to keep cases from exploding and just maintain at an obviously too high level, but a too high level that still allows our hospitals to function."

22214,"The very end of the cold war, but the military was still set up for it."
22215,"I served as one of the non-armed guys who go into cities that have been firebombed and bombed, and put out the fires and find people in the rubble and save them."
22216,The assumption is you will never have enough ressources to save everybody.
22217,"The doctors may be dead and the place with medical supplies could be burned, general chaos is the assumption."
22218,"Anyway, you set up a medical station in tents for treating survivors, and then you go into the bombed place and search and dig for people."
22219,"This is what the first searcher team does:

You go around and shout for people, and those you find you sort in 1,2 and 3."
22220,Everybody gets attached a number.
22221,"1 are those that can walk themselves to the medical place, so they are given a couple minutes or care, like bandage big bleedings, and then given directions to the medical center and told to go there."
22222,That can also be like people that lost an eye.
22223,"If you find a guy with eyes blown out but he can walk and another guy that can walk and has eyes, you tell the eye guy to help the no eye guy get to the medical center."
22224,2 are those that can't walk and can be saved - like if you are burned or lost a foot.
22225,"They get a 2 and their location are marked down on a map, and you tell them ""we'll get back to you!"""
22226,3 are those that are either not possible to save or too much work to save.
22227,Like if they were burned all over or lost their legs or had gut injury.
22228,"Or even if you had a small injury, but were trapped under rubble and it would take a long time to dig them out."
22229,They get number 3 and are left to die.
22230,"We were supposed to also tell them ""we'll get back to you!"""
22231,"At the treatment center they'd always treat 2s ahead of 1s, and the 3s would only be picked up in case all the 1s and 2s got done, and the assumption was that that was not likely to happen."
22232,"So the chilling job was separating people in 2 or 3, especially if they are like on the edge."
22233,"Like this ""this guy would normally be saved, but we could save 5 guys in the time it takes to save him, so we do the 5 guys instead and this guy dies""."
22234,It's almost certainly a death sentence to get a 3.
22235,"And the procedure was just like ""look at them for 30 seconds, and then make the call."""
22236,"As much as I hate it too, the schools and most workplaces need to close if you want to slow down the spread."

22245,&gt; I'm not sure you know what I'm asking - they're either inactivated or live-attenuated.
22246,"The RNA vaccines (Biontech/Pfizer, Moderna, Imperial) aren't live or attenuated because they're not viruses at all."
22247,"Same with the protein subunit ones (Novavax, GSK/Sanofi)."
22248,"The viral vector vaccines (Oxford/AZ, J&amp;J etc.)"
22249,"aren't live attenuated either, despite including semi-functional viruses."
22250,Few of the Western COVID-19 vaccine efforts include the whole SARS-CoV-2 virus in any form.

22256,I like having FB for this reason and have trimmed down my friends list to only people who matter in my life.
22257,Russia is scary it has almost 70k excess deaths its scary how many cases of the coronavirus are unreported and how it could devastate communities
22258,The reason it’s bullshit is because society hasn’t graduated past loosefitting cloth masks.
22259,We were only supposed to limit the N95 thing for a couple months when there was a shortage.
22260,"They are now widely available, but our complete lack of leadership has never changed the narrative to get people wearing proper masks since."
22261,So everyone is still wearing masks that have completely unfiltered air coming in around the edges.
22262,It’s just a hilariously bad joke at this point.
22263,I’m not surprised people get infected because they’re not protecting themselves properly.
22264,It’s no mystery.
22265,And it’s not the planes.
22266,I think 60-70% of my close friends have already told me they won't take it.
22267,None of them are hardcore weirdos.
22268,I'm really worried not enough Americans will be on board.
22269,Please stop spreading misinformation.
22270,I know you mean well but this stuff doesn't mean what you think it means.
22271,A few people getting reinfected does not apply to millions on a public health level.
22272,Please just listen to Fauci and don't spread stuff that you think you know better than him for some reason
22273,Oh this sub hates when you point out that he did that.

22275,Focused projection.
22276,FTFY
22277,The study also doesn’t even talk about antisocial personality *disorder* but about antisocial personality *traits*.
22278,"While a certain number of traits define it being disordered, this is more like saying “people who don’t wear masks have less empathy”"
22279,I know dumb MFers.
22280,They wear masks.
22281,These people are dumber
22282,"I thought Ken was the perfect homologue, I wish it had caught on more."
22283,"This title is just nuts, imagine literally believing you have some kind of disorder for nor wearing a mask"
22284,A well educated population tends to make more informed decisions that benefit everyone.
22285,"There's a LOT of areas in the US that need to be demolished and built back up from the ground, and the best place to start would be education, as intelligent people are usually better at coming up with smart solutions to complex issues, than the alternative."
22286,Conservatives: Nuh-unh
22287,Is ASPD something we're going to have to make policy for in the future?
22288,I mean this and what ever psychological condition leads to Conspiracy mindedness seem to me the biggest threat when dealing with something like vaccinating for Corona Virus.
22289,#Science
22290,Yeah it’s called being an asshole
22291,I’d be more inclined to link it with intelligence and IQ
22292,"They should repeat this test, but with Republicans and Democrats lol."
22293,I bet the results are the same...
22294,"I simply tell them to stop spreading their crack-pot conspiracy theories here, that they have zero basis in fact or science, that they can offer no credible supporting information bar some other cretins' similarly-*opinion*ated blog, and that their shameful catfish techniques only serve to LITERALLY lead to more people dying, closing with ""so do please fuck off with this nonsense""."
22295,"Sometimes I get a mouthful back (expected and fair enough, as I've already said fuck off), but I never respond, since the bullshit conversation dies off anyway as a result of my post."
22296,"I agree

You don't look to those struggling at the bottom of the class when assessing your own performance."
22297,You look to your closest peers and to those excelling at the top.
22298,"It’s been 8 months, probably like a few hundred million infections, and we have seen 24 reinfections."
22299,Granted that number could be a few times higher but still.
22300,"Furthermore, the T-Cell response seems to be very good."
22301,I would consider a year somewhat long lasting.
22302,I agree.
22303,Sweden is so politicized its scary.
22304,I have seen american liberalsbasically hoping that Swedes will die so that they can prove concervatives wrong.
22305,Why wish Swedes die?
22306,"Just explain that Sweden did a lot, there is no heard immunity strateg, lifehere is not the same."
22307,And if they want a less repressive more volontary response they also have to change the country at its vore.
22308,"I.e higher taxes on rich, public health are, employee rights etc."
22309,I've also taken to unfriending and blocking where necessary.
22310,It *really* improves your facebook experience.
22311,Not as much as outright deleting facebook would
22312,Cl2
22313,Wow Canada is really reckless
22314,&gt; I don’t think lower death rate will last.
22315,Deaths are still lagging hospitalizations.
22316,People have been saying this for several months now.
22317,"I do see the deaths rising slightly, but we've had increased cases for months now."
22318,"We should have seen spiking deaths already, and we haven't."
22319,"So I'm chalking this up to ""I'll believe it when I see it actually happen""."
22320,"While good news, it's a shame that we ever *needed* a field hospital due to negligence and a massive surge."
22321,"I kind of have issues with labeling a mass group of people with this label, we all have these traits to some extent, most of the cases of people not wearing mask can be pointed directly at misinformation and ignorance."
22322,"Now the people who intentionally creating the misinformation, they might actually be more deserving of the label."
22323,"Confirmed positive by PCR test but not showing any symptoms (fever, coughing, fatigue etc)"
22324,[removed]
22325,"In other news, science has discovered that straight men like large breasts."
22326,Difficult to know what causes an excess death for lots of reasons and difficult to account for any reduction of other types of deaths.
22327,Ex.
22328,Initially we had a significant reduction in motor vehicle accidents due to harsh stay at home orders.
22329,"For deaths indirectly caused by the virus, ex."
22330,Deaths due to delayed surgeries/poverty like you mentioned...
22331,They're still related to the pandemic.
22332,"Even when someone has the virus and does from complications, it can be somewhat overly reductionist to say the cause of death was covid in isolation."
22333,Instead it is covid in the context of their comorbidities.
22334,"Contextualism as a framework, for better or worse, can be expanded almost infinitely into antecedents..."
22335,"Consensus was the wrong word, I admit fault there."
22336,But it is being told on the side of caution to avoid going around thinking you’re immune when reinfection cases show otherwise.
22337,"I keep mentioning this, but I know 3 people who have been reinfected within 4 months of first getting it."
22338,So there’s obviously some validity there.
22339,Sadly you have to have money to buy or you end up on the streets or in an institution.
22340,A Merica is the mind control nation set free to believe the lies.

22343,"As someone named Chad, it's really irritating."
22344,"It’s linked to antisocial traits, which is a much lower bar than antisocial personality disorder."
22345,Why did you want to block the air vent?
22346,"In Spain, a lot actually leave to go and work in Germany."
22347,"Here it's crazy, you need a university degree which involves a high standard of training - and then the actual job is almost always temporary contracts with few benefits or security and pretty low pay."
22348,"My SO is a nurse, but I'd never recommend it to my children."
22349,Nobody is denying that.
22350,"Whataboutism is nonsense, though."
22351,"I’m not a fan of Trump or Fox, anyhow."
22352,I was making a joke based on recent events.
22353,"Yes, and pair that with people getting reinfected (I personally know 3), and it suggests you aren’t immune just because you get it."
22354,I know.
22355,"The reason I know vaccine roll outs will happen and be reasonably successful is there's way too much money on the table, both in terms of the actual vaccine and restoring the worlds' economies."
22356,"Money is the most powerful motivator we have on this planet, and there's too much at stake for the dozens of vaccines to all fail."
22357,At least he’s trying.
22358,The US seems to barely have taken any measures.
22359,"Israel's Intelligence and Special Missions Directorate (also known as the Mossad) has obtained a Chinese vaccine for neoconjunctivitis and brought it back to begin ""research,"" according to a report by Russia Today (RT) citing local media."
22360,"&amp;#x200B;

　　Israeli media Channel 12 reported on Monday that the Mossad had brought the Chinese vaccine to Israel in recent weeks."
22361,It's unclear exactly how the intelligence agency acquired the vaccine.
22362,"&amp;#x200B;

Multiple government sources have ""indirectly"" confirmed the report to local media."
22363,The vaccine was reportedly procured in order to study its formulation and further explore vaccination options.
22364,"In addition to this, a senior Israeli Ministry of Health official confirmed that Israel is seeking to purchase the neocrown vaccine from other countries."
22365,"&amp;#x200B;

Israel has reportedly developed its own new coronavirus vaccine, but its testing process is still at an early stage."
22366,"Last week, the Israeli Institute for Biological Research (IIBR) in Nesbitzona announced its new coronavirus vaccine, called ""Brilife."
22367,"The vaccine has received all the necessary approvals, and the first phase of clinical trials is expected to begin next week."
22368,"First, the vaccine will be tested on about 100 volunteers, and if all goes well, an additional 1,000 people will be enrolled in the second phase of the trial next spring."
22369,"&amp;#x200B;

　　In recent weeks, there has been a sharp increase in the number of new coronavirus infections in Israel, with the total number of cases now reaching 310,000."
22370,"While this number is relatively small compared to the worst-affected countries, it is quite significant for a country of 8.9 million people, which represents about 3.4 percent of the total population."
22371,I feel like many of these restrictions around Europe don't seem to be working.
22372,They're closing public life down but infections are currently spreading mainly in private life situations.
22373,I'd even go further and say that it's more risky to meet someone at home than at a restaurant that has at least some distancing measures.
22374,"Thanks, I appreciate it."
22375,Notice how careful the language in the source is.
22376,"""suggests"", ""might""."
22377,"That's not a medical consensus, that's leaving the possibility open."
22378,"And even if they were certain, a single study isn't medical consensus either."
22379,"For example, [here is a study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7554472/) proving antibodies are produced for at least half a year."
22380,"They are also very careful in their language, provide an explanation for why their result differs, and note that their study also has limitations."
22381,"That some reinfections occur isn't proof either, they're to be expected, it doesn't mean most people won't be immune."
22382,Consensus is a high bar to clear.

22407,"People hang on social media now more than ever too it seems and the influence that people have is no joke, for example, out of nowhere my friend is defending trump all the sudden like the fuck happened and he used to be extremely left."
22408,Personality disorders are not strictly about empathy/emotions.
22409,What did the parents do in the summer months when there wasn't no school?
22410,I’ll take the lockdown
22411,"Nothing else is rumored, tomorrow Merkel will meet the prime minsters and discuss about new measures."
22412,You dont know his/her situation.
22413,What if he/she is an 80 years obese asthmatic?
22414,Odds are he/she is gonna die.
22415,Seriously fuck the Murdoch media for trying to undermine that effort and go so far as basically inciting open rebellion.
22416,Because they're different.
22417,Gosh.
22418,"As a person with personality disorder, most of the comments here are just hurtful and mean."
22419,Mental health stigma is real.
22420,What a snowflake.
22421,I know you got the social skills just tell me what point you want to make is
22422,"Are there other measures, besides masks and the closure of bars/restaurants?"
22423,"If people are mostly still going to work and play as normal (and perhaps without masks), that's already quite a big gap there."
22424,Well...he did make america 'the greatest' in a fashion.
22425,"&amp;#x200B;

Wear the mask."
22426,Wash the hands.
22427,Dont drink the bleach.
22428,Be skeptical of anything said a week before the US election
22429,I was arguing with a coworker about politics and everything and I mentioned he might have had exposure to heavy metals in his drinking water and he said ... well yeah he had been notified that the lead levels in his water were really high.
22430,"&amp;#x200B;

This honestly might be an issue at least here in rural Michigan."
22431,imagine having covid19 (19!!!)
22432,at the end of 2020. losers lol
22433,Damn.
22434,Much of my extended family lives in Cook.
22435,In Schaumburg.
22436,Including my 90 year old grandpa who thinks he is invisible.
22437,Why does everything always have to be about the US
22438,"&gt;it’s confusing me

Clearly."
22439,What's that?
22440,Profits are important to a company and what drives innovation?
22441,fascinating...
22442,Here I was thinking that companies were going sink billions into this vaccine for free.
22443,"Welcome to the real world, companies do shitty things, Mercedes made tanks for the Nazis yet they are company that is alive and doing better than ever."
22444,"Johnson and Johnson obviously did something shitty, but the difference is that 99% of their work has been ground breaking and health changing."
22445,"If you don't want to take the vaccine, don't, but discouraging others from taking it due to an unsubstantiated belief that one product (out of hundreds) dangerous defect immediately proves all other products dangerous is what will allow this virus to continue to spread and kill millions."
22446,Alot xD i still dont see people wearing masks on stores
22447,Reinfected with Strain A or Strain F?
22448,That is important.
22449,"Last I heard there were 8 strains of covid-19 out there, and immunity from one does not guarantee immunity from the others....hence why any vaccine offered is nothing more than snake oil."
22450,"&amp;#x200B;

If we are talking being infected with different strains then realistically its not a 'reinfection' per say from the body's point of view."
22451,I'm over it man.
22452,Covid is just a huge annoyance at this point.
22453,I'm ready for it to be done.
22454,Life needs to go on.
22455,I'd be angry too if my friend's reckless driving left me paralyzed.
22456,&gt; Isn't wearing a small piece of cloth over your face and social distancing four months out of the year a small price to pay to save all these lives?
22457,Hahahaha.
22458,No.
22459,"That is just as ridiculous as these statements:

* To save people from Diabetes, we are now banning the sale and consumption of donuts."
22460,"* To save people from Heart Disease, only one person per table can order a hamburger and only between the hours of 12:00PM and 4:00PM."
22461,"* To save people from skin cancer, all people MUST now wear long sleeves and pants ANY time they are outdoors."
22462,"* To save people from car accidents, you MUST now wear this government approved helmet."
22463,Its only 4 pounds... you'll get over it because its a small price to pay!
22464,The entire premise is absurd.
22465,Reminds me of the driver who heard on the radio about a crazy person driving against traffic.
22466,"He looked at the other cars and screamed: ""It's not just one, there's many of them!"""
22467,"That's not what it's saying, it's saying that out of the people who don't wear masks, a higher proportion have personality disorders than the proportion in the general population."
22468,"As a US expat living in Ireland, thanks to Covid I’ve not seen my family in over a year."
22469,Articles like this just reaffirm I’m making the right choice by not flying back home and putting my family at risk.
22470,Still sucks tho
22471,"&gt; And now we have normalized mass death and when the next virus shows up and it kills 5% of people, not 1-1.5%, it will be all that much easier to say ""too expensive to do anything, some of you will have to die""

Or climate change."
22472,"I mean, that's been our strategy so far."
22473,What sources?
22474,"&gt;Being remote only helped in that we’d had some advance warning of what this thing was before we started seeing a significant uptick in community cases, we’d had the example of Italy to see what was likely to happen if we didn’t move decisively."
22475,"&gt;To be honest the closed borders thing in NZ early on was actually pretty poorly done, we’ve learned and gotten better at it as time has gone on."
22476,"If we’d relied on being a remote island, we’d be broken."
22477,"We had 205 known cases when we locked down (edit: on March 25th), more than enough to kick on and create a full blown outbreak."
22478,"Only closing the borders, and “being remote”, at that point, was never going to be enough."
22479,"&gt;The biggest and most important thing we did was the lockdown, social distancing, and the community support for the elderly and vulnerable."
22480,That was what broke the back of the virus and forced the R0 below 1.
22481,"We’re once again back to living normally, and expect the economy to recover quickly albeit with the pandemic causing a world wide economic slowdown."
22482,Many European countries did exactly the same.
22483,Denmark locked down around mid-March when they had a few hundred cases and no deaths.
22484,Same for Austria.
22485,"Unfortunately, they aren't islands in the middle of nowhere, and they had to reopen at some point."
22486,And here they are.
22487,"New Zealand is basically a small European country, but in the middle of the ocean."
22488,Did he say which easter?
22489,Maybe he was referring to 2024.
22490,How?
22491,It's depressing having to explain obvious shit like tht lol
22492,"Basically neither good or bad news, they just haven't had enough infections yet to reach the threshold for an interim analysis."
22493,"Of course, in the most wildly optimistic scenario, the vaccine is so amazingly effective that infections are only being recorded in the placebo arm."
22494,However I think it's more likely that the infection rates have simply been lower than expected.
22495,He got 2 experimental drugs and a steroid.
22496,That we know about.
22497,Depends what you mean.
22498,Current projections for vaccines being available to the general population (rather than just healthcare workers and other essential workers) if all goes smoothly - April / May 2021.
22499,"But expecting anyone who wants a vaccine, to have taken it?"
22500,"Sure, closer to a year."
22501,[deleted]
22502,I'm just waiting for either the half-measure vaccines (and I truly feel they won't be too potent at first) or for the treatments (much more likely to be effective.
22503,No one wants to be infected but at least the treatment can alleviate the symptoms/effects a lot).
22504,South asian countries are doing so well in controlling the spread.
22505,Kudos!
22506,!
22507,[removed]
22508,We don’t need to vaccinate everyone.
22509,"If we get the elderly and high-risk people vaccinated, that should be enough for a full reopening, or close to it."
22510,Their actions say otherwise
22511,"There's also the fact that a huge proportion of the population are scientifically illiterate, so they don't really understand what's being presented, and assume if they don't understand it's all some conspiracy."
22512,"Like the guy in New Zealand screaming about Koch' postulates, or people calling it a 'casedemic' or people picking and choosing studies and thinking different studies with contradictory results means someone's lying or doing bad work, or taking every study as definitive evidence of the truth (if it supports their pre-existing view) or not understanding exponential growth or how deaths lag behind case numbers etc etc."
22513,"You see so many people posting graphs and 'scientific explanations' of stuff that are completely ridiculous or illogical but they don't understand it and the people they're presenting it to don't understand it - it's very easy to dupe people with fake science bullshit, or to point to things like errors or changing consensus as evidence of some sort of conspiracy."
22514,Which respirator and filter do you recommend?
22515,Im in the risk group and i have to go house hunting soon to move out for a job
22516,Ireland wasnt screening anyone coming in.
22517,They did not care about coronoa.
22518,I know someone that arrived in Ireland about 3 weeks ago and she had no testing at all.
22519,Lmao dude youre acting weird imo it’s confusing me
22520,"I myself work in a restaurant that does alot to avoid infections (spaced out tables, good ventilation, wear masks, disinfect everything etc.)"
22521,"Toa point where its almost impossible to be infected, yet if there is another lockdown, my boss already said he will quit his business for good because he obviously loses less money by doing so."
22522,Imagine working on a restaurant your whole life and get all your savings erased by a lockdown that barely has any effect on the spreading of the virus.
22523,"We just achieved two consecutive days of 0 cases after a 4 month very strict lockdown (all retail closed, everyone WFH, hospitality delivery only) here in Victoria, Australia."
22524,It’s possible and should be done.
22525,It’s the only way out once the virus has a foothold in the community.
22526,Damn if only the CCP did the right thing because it’s the right thing without needed global superpowers to watch over their actions.
22527,Why doesn't VIC aim for total elimination and errr on the side of caution... and stay shut for another week or so?
22528,Arn't we just going to end back at square one in a few months time if theres a couple of cases still floating about?
22529,Americans need to start taking this more seriously.
22530,They need more time to buy stock options in untraceable accounts before they double or half the stock overnight
22531,Stay strong/kämpa på Danskar!
22532,If that’s true why hasn’t there been widespread reinfection by now?
22533,Now you're getting it
22534,A number of the vaccines are already being manufactured by the hundreds of millions in anticipation of their eventual approval.
22535,Yes please.
22536,Its hard to think that it may take more than 6 months.
22537,why the downvotes?
22538,"I understand that Norway and Sweden had been following the same strategy until mid March, when Norway changed its approach."
22539,If I remember rightly Norway had way more cases per head of population in early March than Sweden.

22545,"One passed away from a heart attack, the other from an infection + having aids."
22546,My late roommate passed away on hospice as well and his services were never interrupted.
22547,I'm not touching any vaccine until a year after it's available to everyone
22548,That is quite significant in a population of only 5 million.
22549,"If you scale this up to US numbers (330 million), it is comparable to around 28500 new cases in one day."
22550,(the US had that number Sept. 08).
22551,"Further steps are being taken, especially in the cities, mandatory work from home for all businesses (as long as it is possible), masks mandatory in the grocery-stores etc where it is not possible to keep a 1 meter distance."
22552,"Mandatory masks in public spaces where it is not possible to keep 1 meter or more distance, reduction of allowed number of people in groups etc."
22553,Hopefully this will help curb the increase.
22554,"(it helps that the area of this country is sparsely populated, most infection is near the bigger cities)."
22555,[removed]
22556,10%?
22557,6% I said.
22558,And only of those infected.
22559,obviously not all teachers would get infected.

22570,"The last attempt on creating a law regarding that vaccine was ""people working in healthcare/nursing need to prove vaccination or immunity to their employer""; eventually that will kick through to me, too."
22571,"And I guess our Disease Control will put quite an effort into signaling towards self-employed contractors that we're being checked by them directly... but yes, I'd prefer any of the traditional vaccines over that rDNA one until we've got a few decades of field testing..."
22572,I have to admit I’m surprised and impressed.
22573,There are cultural and political issues which make such an approach in the US impossible even if we could rewind the clock and know everything we know now.
22574,Tragically it’s going to just burn through the population.
22575,Probably another 400K dead by spring in the US.

22590,There are four known “Human Coronaviruses” that circulate every year during cold and flu season.
22591,They tend to cause very mild common cold symptoms in people.
22592,They’ve been studied rigorously since the 1950s.
22593,"Short term immunity to them, is very well known and well documented and proven as scientific fact."
22594,"In fact even in a recent very exhaustive study a few years ago, they had found that some people had gotten sick from the exact same virus strand twice in one year."
22595,"They caught and got sick in the early spring time, and then later that year after fall got another cold and gene sequencing showed it was the exact same betacoronavirus."
22596,"With all that being said, SARS-CoV-2 is different from Human Coronavirus."
22597,"It’s a SARS-like Coronavirus, which are extremely rare and exotic strains found only in bats and camels and shit."
22598,They cause very severe disease so it is possible the body develops robust memory cells in response to it.
22599,*But...* it’s possible it doesn’t.
22600,Scientists have no idea why we have such short term immunity to human coronavirus.
22601,It could simply be that our human immune systems simply didn’t evolve to deal with coronavirus over the centuries.
22602,"These are zoonotic viruses meaning they mutates are some point in the past maybe only a couple hundred years ago, to start infecting humans."
22603,"The thing of it is, right here, right now we do not know how long immunity truly lasts against SARS-CoV-2."
22604,We have absolutely no idea.
22605,We can measure antibodies.
22606,We can measure memory cells.
22607,We can track how long these things last.
22608,But we don’t actually KNOW if their presence actually prevents us from getting sick.
22609,We likely won’t know that for quite some time.
22610,What we do know is that there has been a small handful of scientifically proven re-infections with SARS-CoV-2.
22611,"We don’t know if that’s exceedingly rare, or if it’s more common and just not being observed."
22612,I think we won’t know these things until at least a year after mass vaccination.
22613,I want to get off Mr. Bones' Wild Ride.
22614,"&gt;The point of this content seems to be to just feel superior to the anti-mask crowd

The point of a study isn't to convince or persuade anyone of anything."
22615,This is not the point of the scientific method.
22616,Whoever told you this has really fucked up your perspective on the purpose of medical research.

22658,As for the FDA - approving plasma therapy over strong objections of scientists is one example of political influence in decision making.
22659,That this was a bad decision is backed up by recent studies showing plasma therapy is ineffective.
22660,Approving hydroxychloroquine for emergency use is another example.
22661,"Also, I specifically mentioned political appointees not the career scientists."
22662,You are reading a good amount of bias that isn’t there into one sentence.
22663,My father's cousin and his wife tested positive in March and again a week or two ago.
22664,It blew my mind since I thought that it was pretty much impossible for the two of them to catch the virus again.
22665,"I wanted to publish something in the subreddit when I learned about their simultaneous reinfection since it seemed so statistically unlikely and suggested that it might be much easier than currently believed to get infected twice, but the subreddit didn't allow me to publish a post without a link."
22666,"I've seen both of their positive test results, the wife sent them to my mother back in March and again in October."
22667,Disgusting.

22672,It'll take around a year for everyone to actually get it.
22673,Fakebook.
22674,But it is true?
22675,"you are absolutely right, it's a time right now to be extra careful"
22676,Fun fact: valved masks have a lower droplet output than the cotton/cloth ones the government wants you to wear.
22677,If they ban valved masks because it lets particles escape they would have to ban those too under that efficacy-based logic.
22678,Agree
22679,Now scientists  are going to come up with some bullshit study to validate behaviors.
22680,I know right?!
22681,I should have added that the one we attempted back in March and didn’t even finish in April was a JOKE!

22689,"Not enough money in the world would keep me alive during another lockdown, because the danger for me is the isolation, as is the case for anybody living at home alone."
22690,I simply wouldn’t survive through another one and there is nothing the government could give me to keep me alive
22691,Well duh.
22692,This has been self evident since almost day 1.
22693,We’ve seen Covid reinfection.
22694,We know immunity isn’t long lasting with other coronaviruses.
22695,We keep doing this again and again with the virus...assuming the best just because we haven’t seen the worst.
22696,"For instance, it didn’t take a genius to figure out this was significantly worse than “a cold” as soon as we began to realize it has attacks the vascular system."
22697,"But here we are, nearly a year into this impact, clutching our pearls to find out that survivors have cardiovascular dysfunction."
22698,Wait until we figure out how your cardiovascular health weighs on your neurological health!
22699,Honestly half of this entire train wreck seems to owe to the fact that people would rather indulge in magical thought instead of plan for the obvious.
22700,Looked into this a few months ago when they were giving RLF100 to very ill people in Houston.

22707,I was looking for that as well.
22708,"I'm not a virologist, but what I've read in the past is that immunity does not rely entirely on antibodies."
22709,"in simple words, people who dont want to wear a mask are assh\*les"
22710,"They are still a very important one, which may make the outcomes much worse for many, many people."
22711,"It's not like ""oh well no antibodies, let's just boot up the back up T-cell immunity!""."
22712,"They work in conjunction with eachother, and missing either of them is very bad news for long term immunity."

22721,You can’t have a second wave if you never stop the first one.
22722,Exactly.
22723,"There is CFR, IFR and PFR."
22724,The 0.1% you're referring to is the CFR of the flu.
22725,"The number were discussing here for NYC, Mexico, Peru is the PFR!"
22726,Population fatality rate.
22727,"To put this in context, the PFR of covid for Mexico is greater than the CFR reported for the flu in the US."
22728,"Anyone who is a close contact of a confirmed covid case is being tested regardless of symptoms, and the close contacts of those close contacts have to isolate until they're cleared as well."
22729,"So like, “20% of no-maskers have a mental disorder that drives it."
22730,The rest are just assholes.”
22731,no its called being an a hole
22732,I think that was because there isn’t a way to help a lot of those people besides hiding them away from society until they die.
22733,This is why we see so many mentally ill homeless.
22734,Many of the Mental illnesses aren’t curable and oftentimes don’t work well with society.
22735,What we could've done/eventually have to do is reform those asylums to prevent abuse so these people can live out their days

22756,Good luck guys.
22757,It was a fun ride.
22758,I've gone through the naming process once.
22759,We spent months with a contractor that specializes in this coming up with a list of suggested names.
22760,"We had to make sure they hadn't been used before, couldn't be easily misspelled with another, didn't sound like any other drugs, etc."
22761,We submitted them for approval and they didn't use any of them; they just picked a random name lol.
22762,Great use of months of work and probably $100k!
22763,Wow... Just wow...

22770,Show me the proof of the statement you just made.

22772,It's still very very important as T-Cell immunity is much more damaging to the host.
22773,Antibodies take out free floating viral particles in the body.
22774,"T-Cells kill infected cells, eg, if you have lung tissue infected with SARS-Cov-2, the T-Cells will kill that lung tissue to stop the virus."
22775,I don't really understand how B-cells would help.
22776,a B-cell produces the antibiodies needed.
22777,"In an ideal world, we'd have both T-cell and antibody immune responses."
22778,Missing either of them makes this disease harder to fight and worsens the prognosis for many people.
22779,"Temperaturewise, India is the same year round, so seasonality with viruses doesn't really play the same role as it does in europe."

22792,That's how resiliency works: just ignore the fact that people are being assaulted over ...nothing... around you
22793,Many people thought so.
22794,"But now, we have this."
22795,"I think you're overreading what they are saying - there's absolutely no reason to ""declare victory"" for Sweden, but I don't think OP or blog cited is doing that."
22796,"Pointing out that they in the autumn they don't have excess mortality, in fact they have less mortality than usual, and talking about the reasons does not mean they did well in the spring."
22797,"Some here are worried that saying anything positive about Sweden implies that other countries should take their ""no lockdown"" model."
22798,"[The Cornucopia blog](https://cornucopia.cornubot.se/2020/05/photos-stockholm-sweden-during.html) has a great post on how Sweden functionally had as much of a lockdown as other countries in many respects, and even if they did well (which they didn't), it wouldn't mean that opening up is a great strategy."
22799,So I’m in a bit of a pickle here.
22800,Looking for some advice.
22801,Covid has just now really made it to my rural town in N.C.
22802,I keep hearing about more and more people getting it including my best friend.
22803,I work as a chiropractor so I’m in close contact with 25-30 people a day.
22804,At this point I’m 99% sure I’ll get it sooner or later.
22805,"Anyways, I’m considering purposely exposing myself right now so at least I’ll know exactly when I get it and be able to close my office for a couple of weeks so I don’t infect any of my patients."
22806,I’d hate to get it and not know for a week and give it to a bunch of people at work.
22807,"I know it sounds crazy to purposely expose myself, it’s just a tough situation and I don’t know what to do for the best interest of my patients."
22808,"Myself and my employees in the office wear masks at all times, clean everything after each patient, and have patients wait in their car until it’s time for their appointment so there aren’t a bunch of people in the waiting room."
22809,I feel like we’re doing everything we realistically can to stop the spread.
22810,Any advice?

22816,You're crazy.
22817,Makes sense.

22821,"We as a human society have lived through the War of a Hundred Years, two World Wars and a lot of other troubling times yet here we are (unless that's the point that needed prove :D)"
22822,because contrary to reddit most transmissions happen with friends and familiy gatherings and rarly at school (at least in germany)
22823,"Yeah, now we have this in addition to the shopping cart test."
22824,"From lab data on all kinds of transmission properties, it could very well be that masks and hand hygiene might only work to prevent infecting others, but will not help much against getting infected."
22825,It might be that a tiny minority not adhering to the rules is able to let the epidemic explode.
22826,"Not by getting infected more easily, but by spreading it when infected."
22827,Examples: Hand washing might not help much when a coworker wipes nose all day with bare hands and contaminates every surface with extreme amounts of virus.
22828,"It may save from a deadly dose, though."
22829,Wearing a mask might not help much having a screaming maskless customer in front of you.

23019,"I'm a single parent with no job currently, but glad to be with them, and have them at home, so I can assess their progress and am getting a great insight into how they react during a school day."
23020,"I do think in person is important, but not at the much greater risk of infecting so many others."
23021,If I could swing it I wouldn't mind doing a mixed home/at school program even after COVID.
23022,It's really helped me understand their thought process better and what kind of tasks are asked of them at school.
23023,"At that point it's on them, society can't afford to wait for them to change their perspective, which might be never."
23024,"On the other hand: you can't change the past, what's done is done, and that town is one step closer to getting past the epidemic."
23025,Herd immunity is achieved through a combination of infections and immunizations.
23026,"We still don't have any guarantees that a vaccine will be developed, and once a vaccine is available it will take years to manufacturer and distribute."
23027,"Consider Rockland, New York, where 5.4% of the population tested positive for COVID-19."
23028,The actual number of people infected is likely higher.
23029,"So fewer people need a vaccine in Rockland, NY to achieve the same sort of herd immunity as other places."

23031,There are literally DOZENS of us!
23032,See you on the other side.
23033,"You are right, but covid could accelerate that."
23034,We shouldn't just give up.
23035,I don't have a better answer.
23036,Some people are just plain narcissists....
23037,Its worth mentioning that only 2.7% of the population has had this in the first place.
23038,The chances that a previously infected person is going to get reinfected is still statistically unlikely simply because the spread isn't significantly broad enough yet.
23039,"Clearly there are certain factors to consider, such as habits of people pre- and post- infection, whether they are taking any precautions now and so on."
23040,"Let us also consider that a person who has been infected with this, may not even seek to be tested again, as they suspect the reinfection can't possibly be COVID again, or suspect its COVID and won't be bad and so don't seek to be tested again, don't have the resources to be tested another time, etc."
23041,There's also pretty stringent criteria and evidence required to clearly show you have been infected twice.
23042,"Currently, there are too many factors in this with too little evidence to suggest one way or the other imo."
23043,"Oh man, I don't know where even to start :D 

But this region seems to be updating the reports over larger periods and report only few deaths (probably the ones in hospitals) fast."
23044,"They had previously several such large positive reports (adding to the death count) over the summer - +14 on 16/7, +20 on 29/7, +10 on 30/9."
23045,We were a bit joking that someone was updating the numbers between holiday breaks.
23046,I won't be surprised if that positive update is now being corrected down because the person that were reporting it to the FHM didn't report with the correct criteria that FHM has (which has happened before with Skåne when they had to correct down numbers as well).
23047,Agreed
23048,it would a national holiday moving forward I think
23049,"As of this writing, New Jersey has lost [1,849 per 1,000,000 people](https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/country/us/) to Covid."
23050,"That's 1 in 540 people *across the whole population*, not just among those who got sick."
23051,The fact that the vaccine trials have not been halted after dosing tens of thousands of participants means it is a certainty that way fewer than 1 in 540 have any sort of severe side effect from the vaccine.
23052,You keep fearmongering about the potential for low-incidence side effects of the vaccine.
23053,I'll keep pointing out that death is a high-incidence side effect of Covid.
23054,The 4 people out of a hundred + I saw at the grocery store didn't wear masks.
23055,And they had weird psychopath eyes.
23056,most ppl who live in the northern hemisphere have a vitamin D deficiency.
23057,"I supposed so shouldn’t say most, but many ppl do have this deficiency"
23058,"No, I think good leadership has capabilities to inspire their populace in ways which Americans have completely forgotten or cant even conceive of due to a lack of it."
23059,How's Canada doing right now?
23060,Australia?
23061,New Zealand?
23062,"Not perfect, but there's a plan and leadership and execution."
23063,"Rosie the Riveter, for example, is an icon generations later which changed the course of history because of leadership from the top down which inspired people to behave in a certain way."
23064,...can we just let the vaccine trials complete safely?
23065,Is that really too much to ask for?
23066,Do you have severe health complications already or is it an addiction or mental health thing?
23067,"I know 2020 has been an awful year for me, after 6 years clean from drugs I relapsed hard this year."
23068,"Cleaning supplies, hand sanitizer, PPE, and transportation costs are crazy."
23069,"Automatic translation [here](https://translate.google.com/translate?sl=auto&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.cnbc.com/2020/10/27/crucial-covid-vaccine-data-expected-from-pfizer-this-week-now-unlikely-to-come-before-us-election.html)

23072,"We aren't even close to the peak time of the year for viral transmission, that won't happen until December through February."
23073,You ain't seen nothing yet.
23074,Once hospitals get overwhelmed every patient that needs to be hospitalized that isn't hospitalized **WILL DIE**.
23075,"Everyone who needs to be hospitalized who isn't hospitalized will go home and infect their entire family, this is how entire families die."
23076,I wouldn't be surprised that by the time April rolls around if the U.S. doesn't have **1 or 2 Million additional fatalities from COVID**.
23077,"Years ago I would have thought you were a silly troll and laughed, but these days I know people really do believe such insane nonsense."
23078,A very tough nose and an N95 or respirator.
23079,shambolic opinion
23080,They should be charged in the same way someone who knowingly spreads HIV is.
23081,Is there a link to show percent positives?
23082,Cases as a whole can be a bit misleading due to how many people have beeb tested.
23083,Whole developed world isn't immune to antivax movement.
23084,Europe has plenty of them.
23085,I am starting to like how the US handled this now.
23086,I used to think Europe handled it better and we are stupid but after seeing what’s happening in France and Britain I changed my mind.
23087,"And no, pointing to small countries in Europe does not count"
23088,"but if I look at it upside down, it looks like an upvote!"
23089,They don't care if they make other people sick and cause some of them to die.
23090,I personally think they have some kind of sick homicidal fantasies that they're acting on.
23091,"Like they *know* they're causing death, and they're enjoying it."
23092,They are truly sick pieces of shit.
23093,How much vitamin d would be needed for a grown man
23094,"ca has 2x the population....

that's not ""neck and neck"""
23095,"&gt;When it comes to people over the age of 70, it is a slightly different situation, we do not have a large increase among them at the moment."
23096,"It is important that we help protect them, but we see no reason to change that part today, says Anders Tegnell."
23097,So... wait until the elderly start dying in large numbers *again* before you do anything about it?
23098,"Great idea, that worked so well the first time round."
23099,"Incredible... do these people listen to themselves...

&gt; Right now we are working on adapting them locally because the spread of infection looks so different in the country."
23100,"...

&gt;  So far, the differences are not so great, very many regions have an increase."
23101,It's like the facts change depending on the needs of the moment...
23102,Need to justify not having nationwide restrictions?
23103,"""The regions are all different"" ..."
23104,Need to justify not having domestic travel restrictions?
23105,"""The regions are all the same""..."
23106,Incredible.
23107,Why does the media let them get away with this bullshit?
23108,"Also worth noting is of the first 30,000, they're getting their blood drawn right now to test for efficacy."
23109,Most of them received their second jab a month ago.
23110,This blood draw will look for the proper CD4 and CD8 t-cell reaponse.
23111,The scientists in the labs will know this week if this vaccine is viable.
23112,This message confuses me so much.
23113,I do care for the elderly and Im saying that the argument is a bad one.
23114,We need to use arguments that dont rely on fringe statistics to be valid across the board.
23115,"We have one chance of landing this right to get as many anti vaxxers on board

I will get vaccinated and will encourage everyone to do so."
23116,"And next I may not work at Taco Bell, but the way you look down on working class people is disgusting"
23117,"I was under the impression Sweden was at 1-2 deaths per day, not 5."
23118,So maybe that is why I was surprised.
23119,What was last Tuesday's announced deaths to compare?
23120,The +40% I'm quoting is a _14 day rolling average_.
23121,We have 20% of covid deaths with 4% of the world population.
