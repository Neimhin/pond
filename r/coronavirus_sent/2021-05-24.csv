1,"&gt; I pointed out the relative success of Ontario's vaccination program (compared to Ohio's)

No you didn't, you gave some one sided statistics and are currently ignoring anyone pointing out that yes at the moment the % of people in Canada that have gotten half a treatment is higher then the state of Ohio, however the % of adults that have completed their full course of treatment is another matter."

80,Well the good news is that they won’t rush them regardless of how much we want it for the school year!
81,And I saw your local cases are pretty low so that’s good too.
82,Ours are still high (25/100k) so we’re just taking advantage of the summer weather and doing as much outside stuff as we can and doing curbside for restaurants / stores.
83,What are we supposed to do for the immune compromised?
84,They will likely never be able to get this vaccine correct?
85,So how long do we have to wear a mask and social distance to protect them?
86,"I understand that may sound flippant and unfair but at some point we have to go back to living, right?"
87,The best way to protect them is herd immunity and I got my vaccine the moment I could.
88,"Talk to the anti vaxxers, they are the reason we can’t have nice things 

As for kids, it’s a bummer I agree, but 12 and up can get it now and afaik September is when they’re shooting for I believe 2 and up."
89,But kids aren’t particularly high risk.
90,"I know it’s not a no risk situation, but again are we supposed to keep this up until middle of next year until every single kid can get the shot?"
91,Compare articles detailing India’s known gross underreporting with China’s unknown underreporting and seeing the discrepancy in vitriol is hilarious
92,How about you don’t paraphrase and show me what he said.
93,"Hint: what he has done consistently is present facts as they are known, and/or ask for more investigation to be done."
94,Seasonal if you're not in a state where it's so hot everyone stays inside.
95,It spiked in the South in the summer because everyone was inside with the AC.
96,"I would imagine outside camp would be safer this year than last year, as there's lower prevalence of the virus due to many who can being vaccinated."
97,Your school district has to be really wealthy.
98,We only have chromebooks for 30% of our kids and that was a big improvement.
99,He was questioned and released.
100,That's very much different from imprisoned.
101,Does every kid have access to a chromebook/computer in NYC?
102,That's crazy to me.
103,I can imagine how many schools have the infrastructure where every kid has internet and computers at home.
104,Snow days are here to stay around me for this reason.
105,You can't tell a Texan they're not the best at something.
106,"They'll just flip the narrative and say the opposite is superior, thus putting them in the lead and doubling down on the opposite end of the spectrum instead."
107,meanwhile i'm the lone one in my family that got the vaccine (1/2 of the pfizer) and my brother just got covid (unvaccinated).
108,my mom is anti vax and 70 yrs old and I have an uncle that is severely at risk.
109,it's completely selfish for her to continue with her mentality of natural news being a source of unbiased information.

119,"I think most people are talking about the latter, but I'm sure there's *some* talking about the former."
120,There's no biologically plausible mechanism by which a vaccine could decrease sensitivity to and/or production of androgens which cause male pattern baldness.
121,Male pattern baldness that suddenly reverses itself without explanation tends to not actually be male pattern baldness.
122,Stress-related hair loss is definitely a thing.
123,"If you had a ton of covid-related stress, that could have easily caused hair loss that mimicked male pattern baldness."
124,"Now that you're vaccinated, covid stress is gone, and boom."
125,Hair comes back.
126,Dude I did everything that was asked of me for a fucking year.
127,"I didn’t travel, I didn’t go to peoples houses, I didn’t see anyone for a year.l so that I could help high risk individuals."
128,I’m sorry that I am not interested in protecting idiots from themselves
129,Meanwhile the US still doesn't allow unrestricted exports while there are still unvaccinated healthcare workers all across the world.
130,As a concept that's good but in reality does it really work?
131,There's been countless times in university where I was told to come in having read a certain chapter and I didn't just because I had a bunch of other midterms to study for or something.
132,I'm just glad we're making it a competition
133,I’m the person that said it and that is not what I said.
134,I said I don’t care about people who refuse to get it.
135,I’ve literally done every single thing that has been asked of me for over a year.
136,"While almost everyone else travelled for Christmas or balked at the rules, I stayed in my house and didn’t get within 6 feet of anyone else for over a year."
137,I’m sorry if I don’t have patience or the mental capacity to continue to try and protect people from something they don’t or won’t protect themselves against.
138,The whole purpose was to protect high risk individuals and keep the hospitals from being overrun.
139,Both of these are no longer an issue with the highest risk people and well almost everyone in the states have had the opportunity get vaxxed for months now.
140,I said if there is a variant that escapes immunity than I will go back to doing my best to help the people that are at high risk until there’s a new vaccine.
141,"But, I’m sorry we can’t be asked to love this way forever."
142,"And frankly if people are unwilling to get the shot, that’s on them at this point."
143,There are a number of problems with the idea - which may have merit - of spacing the shots for higher efficacy.
144,1.
145,"What you say, if it's a crisis you're trying to outrun, you don't have months to wait."
146,2.
147,Logistics of tracking people down after multiple months.
148,J&amp;J's single shot is highly preferred for transient populations for this reason already.
149,3.
150,"AstraZeneca has never actually *trialed* this idea, so it's inherently speculative and not something that will be approved in countries with strict licensing regimes."
151,"&gt; Anyway, I am beyond done

That's a good idea."
152,Crazy how fast we got to two and how slow to get from two to three.
153,"Detained/interrogated/etc - take your pick

154,"https://thewire.in/health/origins-of-covid-19-wuhan-china-coronavirus

This is an excellent longform summary of the reasons that people are taking the lab leak hypothesis seriously."
155,I thought it was very balanced and admittedly it made me reconsider my own thoughts on the issue.
156,This is a good point - we probably should continue to wear masks so our son doesn't feel weird.
157,He does have an existing risk factor so that is definitely a concern.
158,He did go to an outside camp last year and that worked out fine.
159,"Just based on what data we have, it definitely seems like this thing is seasonal, because the rates went down so much lower in NJ as soon as warm weather set in."
160,"You're right I looked it up, a vaccinated elderly person is at similar-ish risk to an unvaccinated young adult."
161,"So in that case it's only fair that everyone follows the same rules, with everyone in a roughly similar effective risk category."
162,Is it National Asparagus Day?
163,That's amazing because we gorged on asparagus with dinner tonight.
164,Where I live I would say there is still 85-90% mask wearing indoors.
165,I see less people wearing them outside.
166,I think there will be some people who will literally wear a mask until the day they die.
167,They will be probably be buried with one.
168,Imagine being this into partisan culture wars lmao

170,"I mean, I'm not gonna blame it all on gerrymandering but that has its place."
171,Also antivoting laws has been an issue for many many years.
172,"Texas is a place that votes bluer than you would think, but like most states with large rural populations it tends to lean a certain way"
173,Which they haven’t done yet.
174,"Yeah I think that's what we're going to do - I mean we've mostly avoided indoor spaces with my son over the past year anyway, other than when we went to the beach and he had to go in the bathroom, or taking him to get ice cream, etc."
175,We just talked about it and he's cool with double-masking if we need to be in indoor spaces for longer periods.
176,Hopefully it will all continue in a good direction.
177,"I hope they can get the vaccine trials done for younger kids by school time, though I also don't want them to rush it!"
178,"J&amp;J should be fine, it showed good efficacy with one dose."
179,This sort of finding more concerns people getting only one dose of what are approved as  two dose shot regimes.
180,"Either because that's the vaccination policy, or they forget, or the second shot winds up being in shortage."
181,Try reading the article.
182,I highly doubt that they were wearing masks outside since that's not really done anywhere in the UK.
183,"Yep, and there is plenty of evidence to show that the ccp knew for about a month that there was a new virus whose origins were in wuhan before they did anything about it."
184,"In an effort to save face, they covered up the news as long as possible until they couldn’t anymore."
185,I don’t necessarily think members of the government there knew the severity and the ramifications of not locking down sooner.
186,But their unwillingness to acknowledge the problem for that month is what made this a worldwide pandemic.
187,I can’t find the source for the video I learned about this from.
188,The channel is laowhy86 on YouTube.
189,He basically tracks job postings from late 2019 from the wuhan institute of virology.
190,In late December they made a posting asking for more researchers to investigate recent discovery of human to human transmission with a new coronavirus.
191,"As many of you know, the ccp would’ve known about this instantly."
192,But they didn’t start their lockdowns until January 23 2020.
193,Right?!
194,He'll never say he's convinced one way or the other.
195,It makes sense if we want everyone to have a chance at vaccination before opening things up fully.
196,"Vaccines opened to everyone here 4/15, so if it takes at most 6 weeks for full protection (if you get Moderna) that gave the general population 2 weeks from when it opened up, to get a vaccine and be fully protected by 6/15."
197,I think that's reasonable and fair.
198,"We've worn masks for a year now, a few more weeks won't hurt."
199,All these states have something in common.

201,Vaccine procurement too.

205,&gt; It's possible with additional trials that Moderna could reduce the dose but it probably isn't worth the effort.
206,"They're working on it for the boosters they're developing:

&gt; Moderna plans to evaluate three approaches to boosting, including:

207,"&gt; * A multivalent booster candidate, mRNA-1273.211, which combines mRNA-1273, Moderna’s authorized vaccine against ancestral strains, and mRNA-1273.351 in a single vaccine at the 50 µg dose level and lower."
208,"&gt; * A third dose of mRNA-1273, the Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine, as a booster at the 50 µg dose level."
209,The Company has already begun dosing this cohort with the booster.
210,"&gt; Second, the Company plans to evaluate mRNA-1273.351 and mRNA-1273.211 as a primary vaccination series for those who are seronegative."
211,These candidates will be evaluated in a two-dose series at the 100 µg dose level and lower.

“I spoke about Nick’s article last week with Dr. W. Ian Lipkin, the renowned Columbia University virus hunter who was one of the five co-authors on the seminal “proximal origin” paper."
224,"He favored a natural origin theory, he said, in part because he had assumed that all the Wuhan Institute’s 2019 work with SARS-like viruses had been done in its top-level BSL-4 lab, which was cleared to operate in 2017."
225,(State Department cables from 2018 raised questions about how well-run the lab was.)
226,"But later he learned of studies with Dr. Shi’s name on them showing that work he considers dangerous had been done in level BSL-2 labs, which he considers highly porous to leaks, not just in 2016, but in 2020."
227,"“That’s screwed up,” he said."
228,“It shouldn’t have happened.
229,People should not be looking at bat viruses in BSL-2 labs.
230,"My view has changed.”
That is still not, as he pointed out, direct evidence of a lab leak."
231,There is no proof of a leak.”
232,"At this point, a lot of the people who were originally saying “follow the science” have thrown that out the window in exchange for “more restrictions = better no matter what.” It’s just a flipped version of what the antimaskers were doing."
233,It makes sense if we want everyone to have a chance at vaccination before opening things up fully.
234,"Vaccines opened to everyone here 4/15, so if it takes at most 6 weeks for full protection (if you get Moderna) that gave the general population 2 weeks from when it opened up, to get a vaccine and be fully protected by 6/15."

236,"We've worn masks for a year now, a few more weeks won't hurt."

260,"It's reducing so quickly, even though I just checked a week or so ago the numbers seem way better already."
261,WTF?
262,"I wouldn't say it's useless, lets say 2 countries were at war and they had to deal with a covid domestically - that would shut down production of weapons, strain supply lines, and overwhelm hospitals all of which serve as useful distractions."
263,It's also possible that it was just a research strain in the early stages that later on would have been developed into something more infectious or possibly something much more lethal but less infectious.
264,Either way if it was a lab leak I'd place my bets more on researcher fucking up by dropping something and keeping their mouth shut so they don't get in trouble rather than some evil diabolical master military plan.

270,Sure.
271,"Do you have a source that includes the sentences he was responding to, so we can know context?"
272,Those are also states that have high natural immunity so they don't need as many people vaccinated to be protected.
273,"Sure, a lot of people died, but those left have natural immunity that so far is as good as the vaccines."
274,The breakthrough rate is about the same.

297,"Succinct and straightforward, the statement puts forward the expert opinion of the Penn Healthcare Epidemiologists’ Workgroup:

\- No study has demonstrated actual clinical evidence of the airborne transmission of SARS-CoV-2

\- The overwhelming majority of transmission of SARS-CoV-2 is via large respiratory droplets as conclusively demonstrated by contact tracing studies, cluster investigations, the lack of infection spread in hospital settings with universal masking protocols and the low estimated""

So what are you saying?"
298,Are you saying droplet transmission was the wrong thing to worry about?
299,It appears they most feared droplets and cautioned about airborne.
300,So I'm not sure what you are upset about.
301,Would you care to explain further?
302,human ingenuity is incredible
303,I understand that.

377,"With the same example from above, we might now have a reproductive rate of about 0.85 in the US."

393,Having accommodations (on site) will be vital but virtual will *always* be more comfortable (and preferred by the severely anxious student) in the short term and will undo any positive progress if the goal isn’t eventually to get them to be back in the classroom (safely) since a majority of them will need to be able to work with other people in in-person settings if they hope to be successful as adults.

471,It was just avoidance and it reinforced their symptoms of anxiety and would likely make things even worse when September rolled around.
472,This is all anecdotal of course but 100% of them reported being relieved to get that first day back out of the way early and that it wasn’t as bad as they thought it would be.

491,Give it a week.
492,It was the same in CO about a week ago...now it’s more 50/50.
493,Here is a report from [March 2020](https://www.who.int/news-room/commentaries/detail/modes-of-transmission-of-virus-causing-covid-19-implications-for-ipc-precaution-recommendations).
494,"Here's what is written:

""Modes of transmission of the COVID-19 virusRespiratory infections can be transmitted through droplets of different sizes: when the droplet particles are &gt;5-10 μm in diameter they are referred to as respiratory droplets, and when then are &lt;5μm in diameter, they are referred to as droplet nuclei.1 According to current evidence, COVID-19 virus is primarily transmitted between people through respiratory droplets and contact routes.2-7 

In an analysis of 75,465 COVID-19 cases in China, airborne transmission was not reported.7Droplet transmission occurs when a person is in in close contact (within 1 m) with someone who has respiratory symptoms (e.g., coughing or sneezing) and is therefore at risk of having his/her mucosae (mouth and nose) or conjunctiva (eyes) exposed to potentially infective respiratory droplets."
495,"Transmission may also occur through fomites in the immediate environment around the infected person.8 

Therefore, transmission of the COVID-19 virus can occur by direct contact with infected people and indirect contact with surfaces in the immediate environment or with objects used on the infected person (e.g., stethoscope or thermometer)."
496,"Airborne transmission is different from droplet transmission as it refers to the presence of microbes within droplet nuclei, which are generally considered to be particles &lt;5μm in diameter, can remain in the air for long periods of time and be transmitted to others over distances greater than 1 m.In the context of COVID-19, airborne transmission may be possible in specific circumstances and settings in which procedures or support treatments that generate aerosols are performed; i.e., endotracheal intubation, bronchoscopy, open suctioning, administration of nebulized treatment, manual ventilation before intubation, turning the patient to the prone position, disconnecting the patient from the ventilator, non-invasive positive-pressure ventilation, tracheostomy, and cardiopulmonary resuscitation."
497,There is some evidence that COVID-19 infection may lead to intestinal infection and be present in faeces.
498,"However, to date only one study has cultured the COVID-19 virus from a single stool specimen.9  There have been no reports of faecal−oral transmission of the COVID-19 virus to date."""
499,So they are noting droplet transmission which is essentially airborne transmission.
500,I think you are splitting hairs here.
501,"Next time, please be more specific as it's important."
502,"If you feel the WHO did not communicate properly, be specific."
503,They were clearly noting how Covid was being spread fairly early.
504,Do you disagree with their assessment here written in March of last year?
505,"&gt;The “ Friends of Father James Altman ” Facebook page, which has since April more than doubled in size to 1,600 members, has posts and comments expressing anger and anguish over what's been happening with the priest, as well as bogus assertions that there is “no science behind the false religion of covidism” and baseless claims about the supposed dangers of the Covid-19 vaccines."
506,"As for the pandemic that has killed nearly 594,00 people in the United States and sickened more than 33 million, Altman called it a “hoax” during Easter weekend services that attracted 300 to 500 worshippers, few of whom wore masks or practiced social distancing, The La Crosse Tribune reported."
507,"""We pray for all who have fallen victim to the lies and bullying of false prophets like James Altman, and we encourage all our siblings in Christ to receive a safe and effective Covid-19 vaccine as soon as they can,"" said Empsall, an Episcopalian whose group has also criticized Protestants for things like fanning anti-Islamic hate."

655,That’s what I was referencing - disease specialists with WHO assumed that it couldn’t possibly be airborne due to size.

677,Living a totally normal life 99% of the time is a circus?
678,In NZ we've basically never even worn masks.
679,"I teach normal full classes, no remote learning."
680,Our economy is doing well thanks to retail and hospitality being at full capacity.
681,Which is a really good reason to avoid it like the plague (excuse the pun).
682,Completely incorrect.
683,We don't have vaccines in NZ and Australia because we didn't have the resources pay premium prices for huge orders like the US/EU/UK.
684,Our privacy laws wouldn't let our people be used for research like Israel and we don't have capacity to develop and manufacture our own like China.
685,So we are at the back of the queue among wealthy nations.
686,The population is all very eager for the vaccine and the govts are under big pressure to deliver them on the promised schedules.

707,Would the state governments not be mainly in charge of the rollout?
708,"Yeah that's significantly looser then Ireland's current restrictions, so I wouldn't even call this a lockdown."
709,I wish they would do a “trial” that would allow any parent to get their kid vaccinated (without blood work and without placebos).
710,They should find a loophole to allow us to vaccinate our kids as soon as possible.
711,"yeah they gotta keep adding more, but it's going to make a big difference."
712,"#s just dropped, 550k doses in Japan in the last day."

723,"Yes, parents worry about their kids, but the unknowns of covid seem much more worrisome than this vaccine that has been given to millions of people without serious consequences."
724,Many of us are also very worried about the long-term effects of the isolation that covid has caused.
725,Those factors might push most parents to give their kids a “rushed” vaccine.

732,If it was an intentional release on the CCP's orders then they would be responsible for the deaths of hundreds of thousands of citizens of the US alone not to mention the UK and other major NATO and UN security council members.
733,It would be an unprecidentedlly large act of war on literally every other nation on earth and would most likely lead to crippling financial and political isolation if not a straight up global war.
734,That to me is why that's probably not what happened because the CCP are many things but they're not actively suicidal
735,"From what I've read, they only need to show that the vaccines are safe for kids and determine what dosage produces a good immune response -- they don't need to do the full comparison of number of cases in vaccinated vs. placebo as was done for the adult trials."
736,"Example, from a Nature article:  
""In the paediatric trials, which will involve only a few thousand children, there might be too few symptomatic infections to measure efficacy in the same way, says Talaat."
737,"It makes more sense, she says, to look at immune markers after vaccination."
738,"“If we see the paediatric immune responses are the same or better than we saw in adults, we can make inferences that the vaccine will be effective.” Both the Moderna and the Pfizer–BioNTech trials list such markers as their primary measures of success."""
739,Because it's not the first time that [tests have been submitted without accurate contact details](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/mar/01/why-uk-hunt-brazil-variant-covid-cases-urgent-england-scotland).
740,"And with our government so willing to hand vital services contracts to questionable companies like Serco, who are currently involved in the test and trace system (though I don't know if they were involved in this particular programme), it made me wonder."
741,"But I haven't doubled down, I asked the dude if I understood what they just told me."
742,"&gt;So you're saying this actually means tracing people the 15 had contact with, which could mean a lot more than just 15 people are being traced**?"
743,"**

Did you notice the question mark, indicating that I am asking a question, not making a statement, ^(it's at the end of the sentence)?"
744,"&amp;#x200B;

As for thinking about what I'm saying, perhaps you should practice what you preach."
745,&gt;How would they know 15 people were infected if they didn’t know who those people were.
746,"Not only did I read the article, but I also have additional knowledge from other sources, so I am aware that the attendees at the pilot events will be taking home PCR tests pre and post event."
747,"Assuming they actually bother to send in their post event test results, each test is presumably marked as belonging to the pilot events, so any positive results will be known to come from those events, even if they don't know who the test belongs to."
748,"And this leaves me to wonder if the tests are individually registered to attendees, or are reliant on the attendee accurately self labelling their test with their contact details, hence my wonder if they are tracing someone they don't have contact details for."
749,"&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR If my original assumption that was based on this seeming reliance on self labelling is incorrect, cool, idc, I'd prefer to be wrong."

758,"For the person to bring the virus to Wuhan, there has to have been a way for them to contract it in the first place."
759,So what you’re saying is that there was a reservoir for this disease that was already spreading in Yunnan before Wuhan.
760,"To be fair, you could be totally right."
761,"If there was evidence of a group of people infected with Corona-like symptoms in Yunnan before Wuhan, you could be right on the money for sure!"
762,"Until there is reporting that shows the first possible cases beginning in Yunnan province though, I’m not sure how likely that could be the case."
763,I do think that is wrong.
764,Do you have a link to that evidence?
765,Also it might not be important whether it’s man-made.
766,It’s probably a natural virus but it may have been augmented with “gain of function“ procedures.
767,I guess it would be analogous to selective breeding at the lab.
768,You get a virus and then put it in a certain animal and then put a cage next to it with a different animal and see if they can spread it over the air to the different animal.
769,Voila.
770,Gain of function - it jumps from one animal species to another.
771,Maybe the next experiment is to put the next animals in a cage and then put more animals in a cage 10 feet away or something.

785,"However, the PA’s activities, particularly given its limited authority and economic means, do not absolve the Israeli government of its responsibilities under international law, as it remains the occupying power."

883,"IIRC on the Chinese internet, people did some digging and they found one game vendor at the market - a vendor that did not sell live game."
884,"It's entirely possible that the virus did originate from within the Chinese farmed game industry, but I could say with relative confidence that emergence did not happen at that market."
885,I'd be more sympathetic to the possibility of the lab leak theory if it weren't so obviously being pushed by the US intelligence agencies.

887,SARS origin was also in Yunnan and 1000+ miles away from hotspots.
888,Virus infection is usually only noticeable when it hits a populated area.

892,Same for other foreign nationals.
893,Did you hear any of that?
894,Btw we also required negative test for flight from India and guess how many cases we detect?
895,The only explanation is China has the virus under control.

916,I grew up in Vegas and everyone crowds indoors in the summer.
917,The difference with flu is its not circulating during summer like covid still is currently.

929,"&gt; But last year, despite all evidence pointing somewhere, we couldn't be quite sure that's the answer, and we still can't."
930,This is a far cry from what was claimed last year.
931,"Last year, claims of a lab escape were ""rumors,"" ""misinformation,"" and ""conspiracy theories""."
932,"Youtube and Facebook were deleting videos by scientists who even considered a lab leak as a possibility, while Twitter put warnings on their tweets."
933,"Honestly, I think in the ""blue"" and ""educated"" areas, a lot of people are going to wait until kids can get vaccinated before dropping it."
934,A lot of people are parents and they seem to be worried and cautious.
935,IMO this is why having celebrity pop-sci talking heads instead of scientific consensus is a bad thing.
936,"Knowledge on COVID isnt ""follow the leader"", once there's extraordinary evidence for China to do something so stupid and absurd, then I'll believe it."
937,"It's very evident to me that the vast majority of people in the world, left or right, are completely science illiterate."
938,We teach science as a set of facts to believe instead of a methodology for understanding the world.
939,"Until we teach science as a universal subject that all must learn in the same way that all must learn basic math, reading and writing, we are doomed to repeat the same mistakes with ideological thinking that is not suited to understanding a more and more complex world."

988,At one point the state had 8000 active cases while the rest of the country combined had less than 100.

990,It did successfully reduce the infection rate to zero.

992,People who are in medacaid expansion states and below IIRC 1.33 times the poverty line should apply for medicaid right this minute.
993,Seriously.
994,This is the last thing people in that situation need.
995,Medicaid after age 53 is a loan and the government will inherit your house instead of your next-of-kin after you die unless the estate is large enough to reimburse medicaid.

999,I am not sure that stores are legally required to enforce mask mandates on customers.
1000,"They are certainly required to have the policy, but I think only the customer would be liable for not following it."
1001,I’m in L.A. and still wear a mask when I go running.
1002,"It is slightly uncomfortable but I still feel its my civic duty to not make anyone nervous (elderly pedestrians, parents with strollers and unvaccinated kids) to breathe my air as I pass them."
1003,Same goes for walking through parks and outdoor areas.

1008,"&gt; OTOH, they ""declared"" a pandemic when it became a pandemic according to the established criteria."
1009,"Declaration of a pandemic is a finding, not a policy recommendation."
1010,"I seem to remember them waffling for a month about their self-defined criteria for declaring a ""pandemic."""
1011,"Their definition had been something to the extent of ""community spread on multiple continents,"" (maybe multiple health regions, instead of continents?)"
1012,"but when community spread in China and Italy were confirmed in late January-early February, the WHO announced that said definition was no longer current."
1013,"If you have established criteria which you unilaterally change when it comes time to follow said criteria, you can't claim to have followed established criteria."
1014,And that’s evidence of what?
1015,That people flying to Australia have a negative test and are thus negative?
1016,That’s supposed to prove that the CCP is honest and forthcoming with its Covid data?
1017,Israel still has indoor masking and won’t lift it for another two weeks.
1018,And like you said their vaccination rate is higher than ours.
1019,Part of the problem with the discourse on this has always been that asking an investigation on the origin of COVID-19 has always been a very quick way to be labeled as a conspiracy theorist and discounted.
1020,As a society we can do a better job reaching the people who believe every conspiracy if we take what they are saying seriously and help correct their wording.
1021,I am from Australia.
1022,We quarantine everyone flying in and test them for covid.
1023,We have seen 0 cases from people flying in from China for a long time now.
1024,They also do this in south Korea/Vietnam/new Zealand and you can find the data online.
1025,Also 0 from people flying out of China.
1026,So if you think otherwise please provide some evidence.

1039,No they aren’t.
1040,Have you looked at Covid cases in the US and Israel?
1041,The vaccines are significantly effective against all variants.

1056,They haven’t decided on masks yet.
1057,So it’s not “to end” at this time.
1058,They had taken samples of animals found in wet markets to see if any of the animals could be carriers of SARS.
1059,They found that the Palm Civet could have been a carrier as early as 2003-04.
1060,They did the same for the wet market in Wuhan and did not find any possible carrier animal.
1061,The bat known to be the carrier of Covid-19 is 1000 miles away from Wuhan.
1062,There are no humans who have been known to have contacted Covid-19 in between Wuhan and Yunnan(where the bat is found).
1063,I’m sure they’re still investigating the natural causes.
1064,We’re talking about a disease naturally occurring in Yunnan.
1065,This is one of the most infectious diseases in the world but it was able to avoid the tens of millions of people in between Yunnan and Wuhan before making Wuhan a hotspot.
1066,Yes.
1067,It's entirely possible someone from the lab sold an infected animal to the market to make an extra buck.
1068,That has happened before in China
1069,"State approved ""online"" home schools are still acceptable, it's just cuts the kid off completely from any social contact with their established peers."
1070,"NY has a program called IVLA, which is what kids not returning to in-person instruction will have to use."
1071,Then they wouldn't have gone 0-100 in trying to stamp it out in their country by welding people shut in their apartments.
1072,"Creating a weapon to wipe out their elderly just isn't consistent with their other actions relating to how they've handled things, they would have promoted as much spread as possible if that was their intention."
1073,Don't we want to use this to inspire more to get the vaccine?
1074,It’s not a lockdown it’s just our current restrictions
1075,"Yeah, years ago when I had ""just"" the flu, it never seemed to go away."
1076,"My doctor suspected either myocarditis or pnemonia (it was pnemonia, the doctor said I should be greatful I don't live in the 1800s... ha)."
1077,I got vaccinated with the Sinopharm vaccine as did the majority in my country.
1078,"There is concerning real world data coming from both Serbia and Hungary about some 20% of people not getting any humoral immunity, mostly elderly."
1079,Cellular immunity is most likely missing too.
1080,"Since this is the first vaccine that arrived in Serbia, our oldest people got this vaccine."
1081,We have 2 elderly celebrities that were fully vaccinated with Sinopharm and still died.
1082,I don't know how many non-celebrities met the same fate.
1083,My mother did not get an immune response from this vaccine as well.
1084,I do not want to take a bet with her life on whether the vaccine did give some type of immunity on the many levels of our immune system or not.
1085,Seychelles are having another outbreak despite vaccinating a majority of their population with Sinopharm's vaccine.
1086,Any country that imported it has close ties to China and do not want to say anything to upset them or hurt their own ratings.
1087,"Therefore, the massive pleas from our people asking to get vaccinated again with a vector vaccine or mRNA are ignored."
1088,"Instead, Serbia just donated 100k of Pfizer doses to Czech Republic because otherwise they would go to waste."
1089,"There were simply no more people interested in getting it, apart from the group that got Sinopharm already."
1090,"Instead of protecting their own people first, our government is protecting it's own interests."
1091,This vaccine is a miss.
1092,Inactivated is not the way to proceed with this disease.
1093,"While this is certainly true, the officially reported efficacy numbers for the Chinese vaccines were nowhere near the actually observed efficacy when the vaccine was used."
1094,For Pfizer and AstraZeneca the difference was much smaller.
1095,This does create problems when health officials plan vaccination strategies with certain efficacy numbers in mind.

1173,We have to take these kinds of measures because Australia is currently in a very vulnerable position with virtually no immunity in the population either from vaccines or from having had the disease.
1174,Fortunately a large majority of Australians have been very compliant with what their state governments have asked of them and we have managed to stamp out these outbreaks reasonably quickly.
1175,We just need to get us all vaccinated more swiftly than is currently happening.

1207,This is a huge mistake.
1208,WHO announced pandemic only after seeing alarming levels of inaction.
1209,It put too much trust in those govs.

1212,"There is no point to further discuss ""lab leak"" until there is scientific evidence found to proof it true."

1234,Am I meant to keep it on while I’m at the table?
1235,"(serious question - I figured it maybe was required on the tables too) 

He replied - no you don’t have to wear it at the table."
1236,You must wear one in the restaurant though (??!??)

1251,The reason I believe China now is because I have more first/second hand information than most other people.
1252,"The Australian government did strict lockdown, contact tracing, quarnatinee incoming passengers and we have it under control."
1253,I saw foreigners living in China documenting the lockdown there and it is more strict than Australia.
1254,I even remember media criticising it being too strict.
1255,So if Australia has it under control then it is not hard to believe China also has it under control.

1260,This is when I realised that we didn't lose anyone from our China team.
1261,They have been back in the office and working normally since mid last year.
1262,One of the project we had this year was to expand our Indian operation.
1263,That is now paused until at least next year.
1264,At the same time we are investing and expanding more in China.
1265,We aren't the only one.
1266,FDI (Foreign direct investment) to China has been increasing and it even overtook US last year as the top.
1267,You have to understand firms like the one I work for don't care what the media or the government says.
1268,We have teams on the ground in those countries.
1269,If a country is failing to control the virus and our operations are impacted or even losing people then trust me we will be getting out no matter what the government says.

1430,"This is why we need to stop saying ""vaccines work against the variants"" without delving further."
1431,"We need to understand breakthrough cases, transmission, and long-covid complications also."
1432,"Hopefully most cases are mild, but it still could have an impact on high risk people, and we're not going to gain that understanding by burying our heads in the sand."
1433,If I'm fully vaccinated do I still need to wash my hands at home after touching stuff I touched when I'm out (eg.
1434,"Phone, pocket knife, running belt, etc.)?"
1435,It's getting annoying having to wash my hands after touching these things and it'd be nice if I could stop.
1436,I'd imagine having the vaccine would let me stop but I can't find any info online about this
1437,You can get from NYC to Miami on United for like $260.

1443,...Just don't ask me to do literally anything to help.
1444,Did the judge have a badge?
1445,It depends.
1446,How does the EU fit into this?
1447,The EU funded vaccine research and production but isn't a country.
1448,If testing is up and positivity is down then actual cases are probably relatively stable?
1449,I also think the way the question was worded/quote sounds a lot worse than it was.
1450,From the interview it seems clear the reporter meant was initial spread natural by 'developed naturally'.
1451,"Out of context, it sounds like some sort of engineered Chinese bio-weapon."
1452,It's not just selfishness.
1453,It's the moral obligation of (democratic) governments to serve their own citizens first.
1454,I bet parties which prioritise other countries over their own won't get re-elected.
1455,Let's not even talk about the money invested.

Wow, you just used the appeal to stone fallacy and traitorous critic fallacy in one comment, impressive!"
1600,"In all seriousness, you come across as someone who doesn't know jack shit about China, the Chinese government, or Communism."
1601,Every Communist movement of the 20th century - from the Russian Bolsheviks to Convention People's Party of Ghana - was run by Marxists.
1602,"Marxists believe that all societies originate as Feudalistic, and that once Feudalism causes enough material issues in that society, they transition to Capitalism."
1603,"Eventually, Marxists claim, Capitalism will degrade material conditions to the extent that the society chooses to switch to Socialism."
1604,"In Marxist philosophy, the same process will unfold with Socialism and the society will become Communist."
1605,"Every single Communist in any position of power since the end of the 19th century - Lenin, Stalin, Mao, Deng, Ceausescu, Nkrumah, Ho Chi Minh, et al - were Marxists trying to establish a Socialist government to bring their nations closer to Communism in the long-run."
1606,"The very existence of the Chinese government proves that China is not a Communist country, as Communism is simply the belief in a *stateless*, classless, moneyless society."

1613,I was so lucky that I had a very straightforward birth so physically I was ok except being exhausted.
1614,I cant believe you were expected to look after baby on your own after all that.
1615,One of the HCA's kept saying she thinks it was a joke that women who just had babies were allowed to have visitors since they weren't sick and should have been able to cope on their own.
1616,Talking about her brother who had a heart attack and wasn't allowed visitors but we were.
1617,I was like this baby is their child too they have every right to be by their partner and baby's side as long as they want to.
1618,You don't know what a woman has just gone through to give birth to their baby.

1623,It made more sense to assume totally natural origins since there was: 1.)
1624,No obvious tampering 2.)
1625,based on SARS and MERS precedent they were both animal in origin and 3.)
1626,"early data led us to believe this one is animal in origin as well (though as the previous commenter suggested, that doesn't mean it wasn't also a lab accident)."
1627,Given this evidence it seemed more likely to think this pandemic started the same way most other pandemics through history; via animal human contact.
1628,"But if course, a scientists job is to continue to collect evidence to challenge this understanding and update our conclusions as that evidence comes out."
1629,As the picture has evolved Im not totally discounting the lab accident theory at this point.
1630,The point of my comment was that I think it's really important to give context of why we were thinking the way we were before we crap all over scientists for not immediately knowing the answer.
1631,"This isn't to say there wasn't also geopolitical motives from our government for what we said, but that's not something I think I want to comment on without knowing more of the story."

1635,Absolutely.
1636,"Part of the problem is that once science goes through the media, it’s like a game of telephone where it doesn’t get explained quite right and then on top of that the headline is chosen to be catchy and compelling, not necessarily what Fauci (or whichever scientist is quoted) would say is accurate."
1637,And then it gets read (often just the headline) by people who don’t understand all that but run with it anyway.

1678,"&gt;“Innate immunity may be more active in children who are infected with the virus,” Carrie Lucas, assistant professor of immunobiology at Yale University and author of the study, said in the journal."
1679,"“But on the flip side, in rare cases it may get too revved up and contribute to this inflammatory disease.”"
1680,Isn't the death rate for children incredibly low?

1682,Agreed.
1683,"My Trump loving, anti mask, anti vaxx, COVID-is-a-hoax aunt thinks there's no danger to be had."

1686,"But she refuses to believe the facts, she says we're all foolish for living in fear."
1687,Ugh.
1688,"&gt; This was only 2 weeks after vaccination as well, and from what we've seen with adenovirus vaccines, they get better with more time."
1689,Why have we still not seen studies about the total efficacy (not just against severe/critical disease) of the J&amp;J vaccine after two weeks?
1690,We know it improves against severe/critical Covid up to 8 weeks after injection but I still haven't seen anything conclusive about how the total efficacy changes over time.
1691,"I value consistency over everything else, especially now that I have kids."
1692,"They're able to sequence every case, so they have figured out that this outbreak is a match for a case in a quarantined traveler from overseas."

1695,That's quite interesting.

1697,"Out of your numerous samples, how would you characterize their basis for this belief?"
1698,"Are they more of the paranoid delusion type (""Aliens beam mind control over Wifi"") or just so unintelligent they are incapable of working out CV19 would be useless as a weapon of any kind?"

1701,This is totally not an exaggeration like at all not even a little bit ok?
1702,It’s funny because the most impactful things that happened to me in High School happened everywhere except school and class.
1703,"Classes were awful, bullying, teaching to the lowest common denominator with burnt out teachers and no discipline."

1706,The CDC relaxed their recommendations a few weeks ago.
1707,Most states are opening up already.
1708,Care to say which ones still want a total Lockdown?
1709,[What are you talking about?
1710,](https://i.imgur.com/v0wlV45.png)
1711,Lol.
1712,Oops.
1713,Sorry about the typo.
1714,I’m not asking for data.
1715,That’s impossible.
1716,I’m simply stating we don’t have it.
1717,Oh no shit?
1718,Maybe we shouldn't have told everyone to take off their masks.
1719,What percentage of the UK is vaccinated at this point?
1720,It seems like they’re in a similar position as the US a few weeks ago where the “threat of variants” is still in the conversation due to plateauing/slight raising in cases.
1721,You don't even have to be vaccinated to enter the contest.
1722,People who have had j and j are fully vaccinated two weeks post jab.
1723,No shit.
1724,"This is why, even though I'm vaccinated, I won't be taking my toddler anywhere anytime soon since the CDC lifted the mask mandate."
1725,[removed]
1726,Wonderful news!
1727,I wonder when J&amp;J will join the party.
1728,"I have family who is hesitant for mRNA (I knoww, I'm tryying) and have gotten J&amp;J for the adults, but are still eagerly waiting on it for their kids."
1729,Fuck it if I win I don’t care if they got a free promotion out of it.
1730,[removed]
1731,I agree.
1732,I've had my first dose and currently awaiting second shot.
1733,"As someone who's dealt with health anxiety since I was a teen, I was worried."
1734,"The benefits not just for myself, but for society in general, far outweighed my own apprehension though."
1735,Not really as their phase 3 trials didn't break things down that way.
1736,You could (reasonably?)
1737,"make the assumption that Moderna will act basically the same as Pfizer (which said full efficacy seven days after shot 2), but do so knowing it's an assumption and not some peer-reviewed fact."
1738,Personally I felt comfortable with that assumption.
1739,You could also set a conservative baseline of 80% based on the [CDC study](https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/70/wr/mm7013e3.htm) that identified efficacy 14+ days after first shot of either Moderna *or* Pfizer.
1740,Not according to the people who still want us in total lock down while cases and hospitalization continue to plummet.
1741,Sure if she had one of the highly debated and not that common disorders.

1744,Maybe?

I hope so!"
1746,It makes sense that younger people are vaccine... lazy?
1747,"We're (California) already seeing walk-in clinics pop-up at grocery stores and similar, so by the time its 'required' it should be incredibly simple to obtain."
1748,"parent of a 2 year old here, waiting and praying for 2+ to get approved :'("
1749,I'm 24.
1750,After the first shot I felt nothing except some mild soreness in that arm the next day.
1751,"After my second shot I felt almost nothing for about 12 hours, then suddenly came down with full body aches, chills, and mild nausea for about a full day."
1752,Feeling fine now.
1753,Everyone's experience is different.
1754,&gt; We teach science as a set of facts to believe instead of a methodology for understanding the world.
1755,I would be satisfied with students who are curious.
1756,The major problem with teaching science as a set of facts is that it replaces human curiosity with obedience to authority.
1757,I like to say that the job of a middle school science teacher is to get the kids to forget everything they have learned and get them to think like four year olds again--the last time they were probably curious about the world around them.
1758,[deleted]
1759,Even in NY they just changed the regulations for camps and daycares in regard to masking because of the public outcry.
1760,"Also, one of the NYC health officials who’s been one of the most cautious voices has been saying that if cases reach 1 per 100,000 in NYC (which is totally possible or will just be ignored) he would be comfortable with making masks optional in NYC schools."
1761,"It’s going to take time, but I do think they will be gone."
1762,Are serious?
1763,After all this time you still don't understand that having BIG spikes in hospitalizations all at once would have lead to a collapse of the health care system which would have in turn caused immense suffering and many more times deaths?
1764,this has been the very basis for our policy decisions.
1765,A virus that killed millions and where it came from totally matters.
1766,Singapore is a FINE city
1767,No probably removed as it is opinion.
1768,"Talk to your doctor, probably 90 days."
1769,I have a friend who was arguing last march that this was no big deal and nothing major needed to be done around the country.
1770,I have a screenshot from our group chat app of him sayinq 'Even worst case scenario with none of these restrictions has 500k people dying with average age being 80+'.
1771,That quote aged like milk.
1772,Differences would be minimal.
1773,Don’t you know bro it’s more racist to call it a lab leak vs saying it originated because Chinese people love eating bats.
1774,Duh!
1775,When I point that out people are like well uhhhhhh.
1776,"&gt;And like you said, most things occur within the first two months."
1777,"My claim is that *all the side effects* not ""most"" of them, would occur in the first two months."
1778,Yup also many of the parents of 12-17 year olds were the last generation to still have Pox parties.
1779,So they know viruses can have long term issues such as shingles.
1780,"That really sucks, and I hope you are able to get the supply soon."
1781,This is the first time I've been glad to be in the United States since the pandemic started...fingers crossed you can get it really soon.
1782,I hope they throw the book at this mutineer.
1783,It doesn't actually matter- you can submit your record anytime between now and the end of June to enter...so feel free to do that!
1784,Well considering the research was also funded by America and Europe I am going to say no.
1785,It’s also why this has been so heavily brushed under the rug.
1786,&gt;I think my entire point is no one can say there is NO chance of long term impact.
1787,We simply don’t have that data.
1788,We have history and safety of MRNA research.
1789,"I'm asking you what ""long term"" means."
1790,"25 years doesn't seem reasonable, but two years might."
1791,&gt;But anyone who says there is zero chance of long term risk is irresistible in my opinion.
1792,Just my thoughts.
1793,"Why thank you, I'm flattered!"
1794,I just think it's absurd to ask for 3 years of safety data for a vaccine for a disease that has only been in humans for ~1.5 years.
1795,Can Australia and New Zealand actually 'wait it out' or is Covid's arrival inevitable?
1796,Australia in particular has the advantage of being the size of Europe while having major cities hundreds of miles away from one another.
1797,"While they are vaccinating their population, it isn't happening at the rate of many other rich nations, and eventually, pressure is going to force them to open again, especially as thousands of Australian citizens are stranded abroad."
1798,"Also, non-compliance will eventually grow, especially as the population see's the rest of the first world overcome the virus."
1799,"I am not trying to downplay their efforts, which so far have been mostly successful, but is their strategy of hermitting their entire continent viable in the long run?"
1800,Because it will be long term.
1801,"This policy will need to exist until they can vaccinate their entire population, which will take years."
1802,Super doubt
1803,To those people though an article like this would be meaningless would it not?
1804,You tell them they can still spread covid and they already think it's a hoax or just the flu and they don't care so what's the point.
1805,"To people who don't think covid is a hoax, most of them are going to be vaccinated by now I would think."
1806,Wasn’t that the point of flattening the curve?
1807,Spreading inevitable infections out so that we didn’t overwhelm the hospitals.
1808,Yeah since February I think the policy has been to get everyone vaccinated from the government.
1809,Those military vaccine distribution facilities aren't even looking for appointments anymore.
1810,You can just wait in line and get your shot so long as your not already in the system and are of the appropriate age.
1811,And with so many people refusing to get the vaccine I'd imagine they are stocked well for those that do want to receive it.
1812,"Actually it’s a pretty big 180.

1815,"I got my vaccine, I was surprised by how bland the certificates are."
1816,They should had counterfeiting features built in from the get together.
1817,"Yes, it would’ve been a bit harder and more expensive to make but distribution would’ve been the same... even special paper with micro printing would’ve been something."

1822,Talking with others it seems like my situation was unique and it's usually flip flopped.
1823,My dad felt great after his first shot but terrible after his second.
1824,"Eh, it could be if she has Narcissistic Personality Disorder or Oppositional Defiant Disorder or some others."
1825,&gt;We don't have vaccines in NZ and Australia because we didn't have the resources pay premium prices for huge orders like the US/EU/UK.
1826,That's such a bullshit excuse.
1827,Canada has a similar GDP and population and has over 50% of the population vaccinated with one shot already.
1828,"Your governments fucked up completely their vaccine orders, there is no excuse."
1829,When can I get an mRNA vaccine after J&amp;J?
1830,"I've been waiting patiently for months and haven't heard of research happening on an mRNA followup after J&amp;J, nor any discussion about whether the US' guidance applies to the J&amp;J vaccinated."
1831,"Why are we lumping all ""fully vaccinated"" together when J&amp;J has a lower efficacy?"
1832,"I'm not believing (anymore) that J&amp;J is just as good, and frustrated that the CDC isn't being open or clear about that."
1833,"If it were true, we should have the data now to confirm it."
1834,"I followed the CDC's recommendation to get whatever vaccine was available first, and now I really wish I could get mRNA, with two young children who can't get vaccinated yet."
1835,Any leads on research here?
1836,Thanks.
1837,The irony of calling someone xenophobic for thinking this is that it’s less racist to believe it came from people eating bats than it is that it leaked from a lab.
1838,Either that or our precautions didn't do a whole lot other than spread the deaths out over a longer period of time...
1839,"Longtime NOVA resident but love the first sentence, describes us so well most of the time HAHA."

1844,"Yeah, I'm seeing that *constantly*, and it's so tiresome."
1845,"My other (least) favorite standard response lately is when people point out that relaxing the mask mandates puts kids at risk, at least two or three people pop up and say ""So?"

1848,Like...*come on*.
1849,"Kids have already missed out on school, social time, camps, and over a year of their lives."
1850,"It's shitty to cavalierly say ""Meh, kids should sacrifice even more so adults aren't mildly inconvenienced for a little while longer."""
1851,When did we become this?
1852,"We as a society deal with much more restrictive policies and laws than this to protect children (attractive nuisance laws, for example)."
1853,"Why is the standard response regarding mask wearing suddenly ""Meh, fuck the kids."""
1854,"I will be seriously shocked if somebody doesn't reply to me to lecture me about how vaccinated adults don't pose a risk so dropping mask mandates don't put kids at risk, bla bla bla."
1855,*Come on*.

1923,They kicked ass after it got out to the rest of the world.
1924,They didn’t tell anyone they had a situation on their hands until one of those not in the government leaked it.

1927,I’d say the same thing if England or Japan did this.
1928,Funny how they kicked ass and the rest of the world is being pummeled by this virus that came from their country.
1929,I think it’s because they locked shit down the right way but most of the free world can’t get away with that.

1952,But I think they're allowing different vaccines simultaneous now anyway.
1953,Aspirin would be the one to avoid.
1954,You’re okay with Panadol/Tylenol or ibuprofen.
1955,Uhhh..... Wouldn't a passport provide the same data?
1956,Yes.
1957,We know.
1958,"I think my conclusion is that there is a potential risk from the vaccines (where we disagree) but that the risks of covid infection are likely always higher, so vaccination still makes sense (where we agree)."
1959,Don't tell them the vector virus tech is just as new.
1960,It only has one approved product -- the Ebola vaccine approved in 2019.
1961,"If anything, those have a potentially higher risk than mRNA since an altered live virus is used."
1962,This is probably the best article I’ve read about what’s to come.
1963,"So much good news but this part stuck out to me:

&gt;	By midsummer, in communities with high vaccination rates, covid-19 starts to fade from view."
1964,"In those places, even people who remain unvaccinated are protected, because so little of the virus circulates."
1965,"But, in other parts of the country, low immunization rates combined with reopening allow the disease to register again."
1966,"Hospitals aren’t overwhelmed—there’s no need to build new I.C.U.s or call in extra staff—but the collision between ship and iceberg is forceful, and each week thousands of people fall ill and hundreds die."
1967,"Some victims are vaccine-hesitant; others were unable, for whatever reason, to get vaccinated."
1968,"Still, perhaps unfairly, these outbreaks come with an aura of culpability: to people in safe parts of the country, the ill seem like smokers who get lung cancer."
1969,The summer surge (and even worse winter one) is very possible in areas of low vaccination rates.
1970,The country as a whole is kind of basking in this seasonal lull…honestly I hadn’t really thought about the summer surge myself until reading this.
1971,"Mid June-early August, if last year is any indication, could be quite tragic and alarming in some places, while at the same exact time other areas with higher immunity continue to live as normal and largely COVID free."
1972,Makes it all the more frustrating that there are so many who are refusing the vaccine.

1987,"Use umang app, and get twitter update on vaccine slot availablity (I'm sure there are accounts for all major cities)."
1988,"You need to spend a couple of hours, Log in to cowin on umang app and enter the first 4 digit of your city area code, wait for the twitter notification and immediately enter the last 2 digit of the area code of the hospital where vaccine is available and book( and you need to log in to cowin every 10 min or so or else it will time out)."
1989,Good luck!
1990,I feel like I get downvoted every time I say this but the US very much is wrangling covid under control right now.

1994,Regulations are letting up.
1995,The US seems far ahead of everyone else in the covid endgame for once.
1996,"&gt; Wisconsin may not reach herd immunity from COVID-19 until fall if vaccination rates continue to trend downward, a key state health department leader says."
1997,This story seems to be playing out in many states.
1998,Sadly it will prolong the pandemic.
1999,Efficacy is what they use when comparing to negative control group in vax clinical study.
2000,It’s why 95% efficacy doesn’t mean that it fails to work on 5/100.
2001,Not sure how they are using “effective” here.
2002,"Yeah absolutely, while I do not have anything to say it's a lab leak."
2003,I also have nothing to prove it was not a lab leak.

2010,"In fact would say a majority of republicans probably aren’t, it’s just the anti-vaxxers are very loud."
2011,"Also, a very large majority of senior citizens have taken the vaccine, regardless of political party."
2012,Most anti-vaxxers I’ve seen are actually young adults.
2013,"I am not at all anti-vax, but I think I would have a bit of a hard time signing my baby up for a trial."
2014,"I know for the betterment of humanity it must be done, and for that, I am extremely grateful to parents that make the decision and for babies for being test subjects."
2015,"My daughter will get the vax as soon as she is able, just something about signing her up for a trial…"
2016,"Good question--we know from years of vaccine development (more than 100 years, actually!)"
2017,that we see potential side effects occur soon after vaccination.
2018,"potential side effects are as a result of the immune response which happens soon after the vaccination, we do not see new effects many years or months later."
2019,"the vaccine ""active ingredient"" so to speak enters your body, your immune system recognizes it and learns about it (just as happens throughout your dailiy course of life) and the active ingredient is broken down and it's gone."
2020,"Post flaired Europe

Americans: must be about America."
2021,"Yes but do you think the commenter above was talking about them when he said ""part-time patriots"" and ""weekend warriors""?"
2022,There are limits to individual rights.
2023,There are the rights of the community and there are communal responsibilities.
2024,Idiots have the right to self-destruct.
2025,They do not have the right to take others with them.
2026,"He took an oath, he broke it."
2027,He tried to get other to break theirs.
2028,Mutiny.
2029,You're totally right.
2030,He absolutely would have been allowed to attend the rally out of uniform and if he asked for a desk job that didn't involve vaccine distribution that almost certainly would have been approved.
2031,The problem is calling on other soldiers to refuse to do their mission.
2032,"And it looks like all, but 10 have more than 50% with at least 1 dose so within 28 days those should be over 50% fully vaccinated too."
2033,I'm almost certain it wasn't natural.
2034,"Doesn't mean it was made in a lab, but it could easily be caused by horrible conditions animals placed in captivity may be in."
2035,Because human psychology doesn’t work that way and we don’t all have the time to check sources and compare against others.
2036,And you have Russia on the other side with multimillion dollar military operations creating this stuff.
2037,Thanks!
2038,"Still glowing from my jab (not literally, lmao)."
2039,I think by August I'll have had my 2nd in July and the data will show I can hug them with no precautions.
2040,"Dad's on lots of medication so it's best to be a bit careful, at least the first few days I'm with them."
2041,"The first visit will be with my brother for a weekend, then back to his place in Surrey."
2042,"He works around London but I work from home, so that'll give me a chance to try video calling in their village in Lincolnshire."
2043,"If it's fast enough, I can move up to be with them for a while - once we all agree it's safe enough to."
2044,Ty for ur service kind sir
2045,"Oh, shit, so this is like the [Civil Air Patrol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civil_Air_Patrol) equivalent of the Canadian military."
2046,Lol.
2047,This dude's a joke.
2048,They need to wreck him because he's pretty obviously using the uniform as a political prop in order to make people think he's a big shot military person when he's just a scout leader.
2049,Shame on him!
2050,So some rando from CNN is now deciding what's critical and what's not?
2051,I'll definitely by the notion of a cover-up due to negligence or incompetence over the deliberate development and release of this virus
2052,Literally what?
2053,"Yes, it confers immunization."
2054,Whether or not it does it the way vaccines do isn't in question: of course it does it differently.
2055,I think you think I'm arguing against in person learning?
2056,I am not.
2057,"I have repeatedly said in this thread that children have already been asked to sacrifice entirely too much during covid, which includes in person learning."
2058,That's why it aggravates me so much to see people acting like asking kids to sacrifice *more and for longer* so that adults don't have to wear masks is no big deal.
2059,"There are legitimate reasons to put kids back in school, including social and emotional reasons."
2060,"However, again, politicians who have publicly argued against funding schools and providing healthcare for at risk children sound kind of bullshitty to me when they suddenly act all concerned about kids education and well-being."
2061,Those are the people arguing in bad faith.
2062,Not me and not you.
2063,"If we, as a country, had gotten our collective shit together re masking, social distancing and *brief* periods of quarantine, we could have dealt with this last summer and had the kids in school all year."
2064,"I think we're on the same side, here."
2065,I hope your kid/s are safe and well.
2066,Parenting in the pandemic has been a challenge that I think few of us were fully prepared for.
2067,That map is difficult to look at.
2068,"I also worry that they've made the higher vaccination states a darker color which people now associate with ""worse."""
2069,It might give the anti-vax crowd more (unreasonable) incentive to refuse vaccination.
2070,I thought Japan still blocked foreign travel?
2071,Is that not the case?
2072,I hope you’ll let your child get back to life as normal once they recover since they’ll have the antibodies

2075,Odd how they never worried about the long term complications of vehicle related injuries before all this started.
2076,Maybe we should just make all learning permanently remote?
2077,Australia initially ordered 10 million doses of Pfizer to immunize front line workers and the most vulnerable long before Canada did.
2078,We have been on a more relaxed stance since then.
2079,Both countries aren't mad about it because we didn't cock it up in the first place and so can wait.
2080,We aren't locked down.
2081,We don't have to wear masks.
2082,Your superiority about being better at vaccinating people will always pale against our relative death toll.
2083,We can fix our vaccine roll out.
2084,You can't fix your failures.

2113,Of course that is one of the biggest problems.
2114,Even the same level schools in the same district can be vastly different much less different counties (rural vs urban) or different states.

2118,One still closes during planting and hunting season while the other visits museums and goes to foreign countries for structured trips.
2119,Again these are literally 30 mins apart and in the same county and district.
2120,"The ironic thing is the more active, most diverse, highest rated school fared better switching to remote work even though all the ""trips, fun and extras"" stuff also stopped vs the lowest rated one which barely managed one field trip a year and consisted of mostly class to class to class sitting at a desk."

2126,Why don’t “we” just ignore misinformation?
2127,Good.
2128,It's stupid.

ask the virus if ""he"" can skip infecting the unvaccinated at a concert."

you are getting high on my level of absurdity detection now"
2153,This actually isn't true.
2154,[26 states are below the average](https://www.beckershospitalreview.com/public-health/states-ranked-by-percentage-of-population-vaccinated-march-15.html) with 24 and DC above.
2155,"With the exception of Georgia, those deep south and Rocky Mountain states (Utah, Wyoming, and Idaho) are all low population so even though they are very low in %vaccinated, they can't really drag the national average that far down."

2193,Mild to asymptomatic infection can give you long lasting Long Covid too.
2194,"People are quick to forget what happened with Manaus, Brazil."
2195,The area was held up as an example of expected herd immunity due to natural infection.
2196,Then the P.1 variant arrived causing a painful second wave.
2197,Some protection from natural immunity is better than nothing.
2198,However inadequate protection also leads to more breakthrough that is on the mild to asymptomatic side.
2199,This adds silent transmission to a population that is often letting their guard down.
2200,I believe this is why we are starting to see some new outbreaks in places that have done an exceptional job with mitigation.
2201,This is the issue with variants that have some immune escape.
2202,That's right.

2213,This sub has always been very pro-public health measures and seeing them disappear is making people too nervous that there will be another surge or that their kids might be in danger for them to feel comfortable relaxing and celebrating the improvements that have been made yet.
2214,Most experts agree with you though that the US epidemic is nearing its endgame.
2215,Also I don’t know why it’s never discussed that the lower level of infections means kids and the immunocompromised are probably much less likely to be infected now than they were a few months ago even without as many masks around.
2216,I don't expect India to have that kind of infrastructure.
2217,My perspective here is that a brigading of quality information has been happening for sometime now.

2241,He could watch videos of your kids falling off bikes all day.
2242,He doesn't care about your kids.
2243,A lot of young people want to travel in the summer and most of them won't be fully vaccinated until September.
2244,There's a much larger group of people who are simply unsure or untrustworthy.
2245,The good news is I think most of these people can be talked into getting it.
2246,The pure crazy anti-vaxxers are basically a lost cause IMO but like you said they are not the main problem I think.
2247,"Not an expert obvi, but I have some optimism that could be in September/October."
2248,To really hammer it home would be to allow under 12 to get shots so those who are most worried about their children can be at ease.
2249,"In European countries, it's not as simple as that."
2250,Some of us don't even get cards and all of these systems are going to require a QR code which links to the vaccination database.
2251,"We didn't do that, but so many Americans are scared of others getting ""special treatment"" and think other people need to have the same problems they do or else it's ""unfair""."
2252,"Wait, are we talking about companies exporting goods and arguing that that means countries/unions are exporting goods in macroeconomic terms?"
2253,Because those are both true.
2254,What I don't quite get in the argument (correct me if I'm wrong) is why it matters what origin that company has.
2255,"American, Dutch, Italian company, it should not matter."
2256,They are companies sending goods for exports and preparing papers.
2257,"If they do it legally in that country, that's all that the governments should care."
2258,"That is the definition of a free market, right?"
2259,"The reason why these arguments are very heated is because if things were the other way around, US would be outraged, and for good reason."
2260,"It doesn't mean we don't understand the difficult situation the US has been in and why this strategy was chosen, but I think it's fair that some countries are bitter about the delays in their own vaccination rates because of the lack of raw materials for example."
2261,"Imagine you'd be now in their situation, feeling there are a lot of restrictions and no way out."
2262,Wouldn't you be annoyed too?
2263,Another summer and Christmas in lockdown with no end in sight.
2264,I think these are all valid feelings.
2265,"Not to sound super conspiracy, but I don’t find it unreasonable that it didn’t come from the wuhan lab"
2266,"I've been going off of Worldometers US case and deaths rates just to keep an eye on how things are going, but I just noticed that the CDC's data is substantially different with regards to rolling 7-day average death rate."
2267,Right now the CDC [shows the rolling 7-day average deaths for the USA as 457](https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#trends_dailytrendscases) and [Worldometers shows it as 543.
2268,](https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/country/us/#graph-deaths-daily) My best guess is that the CDC backdating deaths to when they actually occurred (so a death last week that just got counted today actually gets assigned to the correct date) and Worldometers is looking at the difference in total deaths between what yesterday's total was and what today's was?
2269,Anyone have any insight?
2270,"Either way, the drop in deaths in the last few weeks has been **very** encouraging."
2271,Just in the last week the daily average has dropped from 551 to 437.
2272,There's a ban on Europeans going to the US.

2275,Our leaders can't seem to lead by example to save their lives - literally.
2276,Cool.
2277,Nice gaslighting
2278,\&gt;and vaccinated people too impatient for comfortable faces.
2279,The blame stops and ends with the willfully unvaccinated people; vaccinated people didn't petition the CDC for new guidance and plenty of us are still choosing to mask up.
2280,The downvotes would indicate that you’re not supposed to ask what’s in it.
2281,That’s fair.
2282,As a parent and making choices about your risk aversions for them you are completely with in that right to feel that way.
2283,What you are going to have a difficult time doing is proving why a 2.3% rate of long lasting symptoms warrants keeping mask mandates and social distancing.
2284,"You are also going to have to explain why symptoms like fatigue, headache, or lack of sense of smell should be included into that 2.3% (dysopnea seems to be the only significant symptom listed in the study warranting immediate medical care)."
2285,The current data being reported on this subject is no where near high enough to be sparking concerns for me and apparently the CDC.
2286,The article says it was unrelated to both Covid and the vaccine.
2287, You don't expect to see the Swedish Statsminister or the Italian President of the Council.
2288,Why should the Irish term be treated differently?
2289,"By expecting it to be used in English, you demean the status of Irish to just something symbolic."
2290,[deleted]
2291,Cool.
2292,Enjoy the India variant coming to your country.
2293,"And look forward to the future Kuala Lumpur, Montenegro, Belize, Kazakhstan, Irish, etc variants coming to your country in the future, because your government didn't bother stopping unvaccinated travellers from all over the world arriving because it would ""restrict people's lives and freedoms""."
2294,I agree that counting cases is an atrociously inaccurate measure and we can't make perfect deductions from it but the problem is people never say this when cases are actually rising.
2295,"If this data is bullshit now, it was bullshit by then too."
2296,"But, deaths might be starting to ""plateau"" (at a very high level though) and not decreasing so soon, I also know that they are criminally undercounted in India but at least it is a more consistent measure"
2297,Depends on age group.
2298,Ages 65+ sure.
2299,Ages 16 and below no.
2300,"No, because I'm respectful."

2302,"Kids under twelve are specially vulnerable to covid so please get your vaccine, if you don't care about your own life at least do it for the kids!"
2303,"While it's likely to happen, it'll also be so far out that they'll not connect the dots or reject the data that suggests there is a correlation (as has been their prerogative the last year and change)."
2304,Hillier is so terrible that the provincial conservatives actually kicked him out of their party.
2305,He can't be fired as an MP but if he tries to run again he will have to do so as an independent because no one wants him on their team.
2306," We allow them to leave European territory, instead of banning and only allowing in select circumstances like the US."
2307,There is surely evidence?
2308,"They are not a very transparent country, they are too densely populated to achieve the same results of geographically isolated islands, there is no way that what didn't work anywhere would be a magical bullet there, their anti Covid measures are unnecessarily strict for a place where Covid is supposed to be eradicated, etc, etc, etc."
2309,"He might be wrong (just as you might) but it is ludicrous to say ""there is no evidence""."
2310,Yea wondering that too.
2311,I'm an EU citizen but living in the US and got vaccinated here.
2312,"I'd love to be able to see family and friends in the EU in the summer, but it's still super unclear if and how I'd able to prove that I'm vaccinated."

2314,The article does not load for me.
2315,"He was at a public gathering, in uniform, calling on all military personnel to disobey direct lawful orders from their superiors, which is the definition of mutiny."
2316,"As transporting vaccines from point A to point B in military vehicles is not unlawful, there is no legal reason to disobey an order like that."
2317,It's more detrimental to your child to keep them inside and not let them interact with people other than you.
2318,"I know this is an unpopular opinion in this subreddit (minus the daily, stickied post), but it's true."
2319,We don't go through all of this for the flu and the flu has already been proven to be worse for toddlers than covid.
2320,"You can be afraid of unknown, probably unlikely, long term effects of covid, sure."
2321,But the long term negative effects of children not growing up with normal social interactions is a far more prevalent threat.

2331,You can’t expect India to become a country with world class infrastructure or develop a working bureaucracy overnight.

2345,"Several states have reached 70% vaccination rates, do they have herd immunity?"
2346,"If so, they should be able to rescind their mask mandates."
2347,"Unfortunately, that's not the argument I've been seeing a lot of people make, and instead, they choose to argue vaguer points."
2348,"The US is not going to reach herd immunity at the same time and all the states have never been using the exact same COVID protocols, why do we expect lifting those protocols to be any different?"
2349,"Also, there will still be unvaccinated people who pose a threat to children under 12, even after the 70% goal has been reached."
2350,"Thus, we can't make that argument based on just the risk that unvaccinated pose to young children."
2351,"Instead, we have to deliberate on *how much* of a risk do the unvaccinated pose based on the number of vaccinated adults compared to the unvaccinated, but again, the arguments I'm seeing do not factor in this kind of risk assessment at all."

2366,Canadian Cadets is a youth organization (12-17) that's kinda analogous to Scouts.
2367,The adult instructors (CIC) are technically commissioned reserve officers of the military.
2368,"In addition, the lowest officer rank in the Canadian military is ""Officer Cadet"" (or Naval Cadet for those in the Navy)

So this guy is basically an Officer Cadet (officer recruit), for the reserve branch of the military that instructs Cadets (kids/youth)."

2371,"So, the numbers have very little basis when

Meaning without testing, there's very little to base 'things are so much better' on, is there?"
2372,And they are not reporting zero cases.
2373,In fact they have daily cases reported.

2379,Three months of illness would be horrific.
2380,A 1/50 chance of having negative symptoms lasting longer than 3 months is totally unacceptable.
2381,"That's not even considering lost school time, physical activity, etc that the kid would suffer within that 12-week window."
2382,"Given a choice between a more than 50% risk of short-term and 2.3% risk of long-term health complications for my kid and keeping him masked while in public and avoiding indoor locals with unmasked patrons until he can get vaccinated, I chose the latter."

If you go by the current (limited) data, we have not seen the rate of myocarditis after vaccination to be higher than the rate of myocarditis in the general population."

&gt;Yaffe explained that while an investigation into the man’s death is ongoing and the final cause of death has yet to be officially determined, it has been confirmed that he had VITT at the time of his death."

2551,Wow.
2552,There is ZERO evidence that the virus creates the same immunity to other strains.
2553,Why is this hard for you people to admit?

I've had a read on the HSE (official Irish government) website and can't see any major ones

Pfizer - 95%
Moderna - 94%

**Side effects:**

Both appear to be practically the same too with negligible side effects."
2730,"Although for both the HSE website mentions ""More than 1 in 10,000 people may develop Bell’s palsy""

BP is usually temporary as far as I know


**Other:**

Both have a 4 week gap for the second shot

With Pfizer you're good to go a week after this and Moderna is two weeks after

Happy days

**Indian variant:**

Quote:

The Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna coronavirus vaccines appear to protect against COVID variants B.1.617 and B.1.618 first identified in India, researchers have reported in a new pre-print paper, which has not yet been peer-reviewed, CNN reported


More good news there

**Miscellaneous:**

Quote:

""New evidence from Israel shows the risk of severe COVID-19 was reduced by 92%, 7 days after 2 doses of the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine""

It's looking like almost all (if not all) 40-49 year olds in Ireland will get one of these two vaccines so I thought it'd be good to jump into the data

**TLDR:** On reading the information I've found, they seem to be pretty much the same Vaccine 

Thoughts?"
2731,Well masks are more helpful at protecting others (since stuff doesn’t get spewed around) but certainly can still over protection for the person wearing it.
2732,Personally we’re just avoiding indoor public spaces when we’re with kids (easier since our kids are young) and hoping they get approved for the vaccine before we’re too far into the school year.

2775,"We live in a fast-moving world, and the interest and political will for that discussion is here now."
2776,It doesn’t take away from vaccination progress or any other steps needed to end the pandemic.
2777,"Sure, some people will make dumb statements about how they are 100% sure COVID came from a lab."
2778,Other people have made equally dumb comments about the lab leak being a 100% baseless conspiracy theory.
2779,That doesn’t mean we need to avoid discussion—or even speculation—on this topic.
2780,Just wait until he finds out he paid them to develop it.
2781,"Agreed, I had the same experience."
2782,Very surprising given it's Texas.
2783,And that's their personal choice but actual mandates and store policies should be completely retired for good from the point the CDC declares numbers are low enough nobody needs to mask
2784,Odd.
2785,"Though indoor masking is at the same level in Georgia, in that those who wore them before still seem to be wearing them inside while those who didn't still aren't wearing them."
2786,"Most of the stores still have mask signs up, though."
2787,I think that should still exist in colleges where there are no in person lab components.
2788,There's no reason why the lectures can't be recorded.
2789,There would need to be some sort of way for online students to interact though like maybe a screen that turns on when someone has a question.
2790,"I'd say I'm the complete opposite though, I much rather be in person."
2791,Too much anxiety mixing my workplace with my home.
2792,My sister has a 10-year-old and an 8-year-old.
2793,"They are going out and stuff, the kids and parents are wearing masks."
2794,"Well, the parents are double-vaccinated but they wear masks with the kids because it seems cruel to just make the kids wear masks."
2795,"They are mostly back to normal, just with masks."
2796,"The kids, notably, don't have any (known) health conditions themselves."
2797,They do tend more to outdoor than indoor activities but they go to grocery stores and they are going to day camp in the summer and they are back to partial in-person learning.
2798,They are also in a well-vaccinated state.
2799,Dubrovnik was my first time venturing to Europe.
2800,It was such a beautiful place.
2801,I'd go back in a heart beat.
2802,"Ffs, semiconductors are too important, let's airdrop some Moderna to TSMC."
2803,"Mandates might be out of the question, but plenty of people may choose to mask up of their own accord."
2804,I don't know.
2805,Kids are very resilient.
2806,"I just have one class as an anecdotal point, but the kids seems to be doing just fine."
2807,They are making more progress in some areas and less in others.
2808,"I don't think any of of them will have problems next year, and many of them seem like they are learning how valuable their classroom experience is and will excel even more when going back."
2809,I'm sure they'd suffer much more academically by losing family/friends to covid.
2810,Same
2811,My kids still can't get the vaccine
2812,If they find the cases to be nothing burgers then it's an even more positive sign.
2813,"Or you really really hate shots to the point where you just won't get it with two shots, but might survive and do it with one."
2814,Might be stupid but it’s the rule.
2815,You are not entitled to employment at a private company.
2816,You are hired and fired for cause.
2817,The cause was not getting a flu shot.
2818,Go ahead and work somewhere else.
2819,Real world ain’t a book.
2820,Yes.
2821,Oh yeah.
2822,Posture is SO important.
2823,It factors into chronic pain a lot more than people realize.
2824,"If you get a clot, you’re *going to feel it."
2825,* They’re not a vague symptom; they hurt.
2826,"You should seek medical attention if you have intense pain, shortness of breath, or a severe headache that doesn’t go away with over the counter pain relievers."
2827,&gt; The trend is consistent; what could cause it to plateau and not head towards 0 / a negligible smattering of cases from time to time?
2828,Unvaccinated people.
2829,I won’t be donning the mask again unless there is a new variant that escapes the vaccine.
2830,Everyone can get the shot now.
2831,"If they don’t want it, I’m not interested in protecting them."
2832,They don’t give a shit anyways
2833,California has been on fire a lot longer than that.
2834,Natural fires are not a 21st or even a 20th century phenomena.
2835,It is still crazyland on the covid Slack channel where I work.
2836,It's one crazy conspiracy theorist against the world but he is ever-vigilant with the conspiracies!
2837,"Yeah, as I understand it the market was more of a superspreader event."
2838,[deleted]
2839,*Historical climate sighs again.
2840,*
2841,"To a degree yes, but as far as I know the data we have includes wearing masks."
2842,It seems we will find out with more certainty after a few weeks have gone by without the masks.
2843,"As someone who doesnt care at all about professional team sports unless they represent the state of colorado, I completely agree."
2844,If we added it as a bonus to the olympic medal count I bet we could get a couple million extra people vaxxed up too.
2845,Never said I was.
2846,Needing to correcting bad assumptions apparently comes in twos.
2847,A discredited reporter?
2848,Now you are just making things up wholesale.
2849,I think the issue is you are basing everything you are posting based on one Fauci quote.
2850,I’m basing what I’m saying based on everything he has been saying lately and everything he said a year ago along with what other scientists were saying.
2851,"I think your motivations aren’t based in good faith disagreement, so I’m not going to engage with you any further."
2852,"When a virus is allowed to run all willy nilly around the world, it's time to have a talk with all the countries about getting their shit together."
2853,This should have been contained.
2854,Not flown all over the world.
2855,[deleted]
2856,"based on history, cause lab outbreaks are very common"
2857,"If the lab leak theory proves to be true, then the most likely scenario is that it was accidental."
2858,This could potentially lead to a worldwide change in how we research infectious diseases.
2859,No one is stopping the discussion.
2860,But you need to be clear about the language.
2861,Even in this thread there are comments about how they knew it was from the lab when Dr. Fauci makes no such allusion.
2862,"We should have this discussion and how to prevent the pandemic but I didn't see a point of doing it when the pandemic is not even done yet and there are more immediate concerns including vaccination of the rest of the world, international cooperation, mutants, variations and herd immunity."
2863,Can we reach 150 million people fully vaccinated by the end of June?
2864,Theres something wrong with that active cases metric.
2865,"If you look at the chart, its never gone down, its just a straight line from 1.6 million for months."
2866,But who are “they?” I’m a pro-vaxx Democratic Biden voter (hope this doesn’t get removed for politics) who has been saying for months that we haven’t had a proper investigation to rule out the lab leak.
2867,I’ve never been invested in any conspiracy theory that I know of before.
2868,And yet I’ve been called so many names for saying we need more investigation on this topic because people assume it must be coming from the opposite political tribe.
2869,The fact that they are acting like their parents gives me hope
2870,"I think the maximalist interpretation/possibility is an accidental release, and when the authorities realized what had happened and that they couldn't eradicate it quickly or without their country suffering, they decided to let it spread/actively spread it to the rest of the world while locking down their own country under the idea that they had nothing to gain by ""fixing"" the problem and letting the rest of the world skate, and a lot to gain by inflicting economic pain on the rest of the world and being the first to re-open--which was exactly what happened, China surged ahead economically while everyone else withered."
2871,"To be clear, I'm not saying this happened."
2872,Just saying it's a possibility and would match China's pragmatic way of ruling.
2873,"Fauci is “no longer saying” 50 million other things also, when he answers one specific question."
2874,"He said he is not convinced, in answer to the question “Are you convinced...”."
2875,Which is true.
2876,But if he had been asked that question a year ago he would have said the same thing - because of the weight of that word to a scientist.
2877,Instead what he did back then was show evidence he had.
2878,He is saying we need to investigate more.
2879,Which is true.
2880,And he has also said that before.
2881,You are concluding it is a *change* as opposed to a specific answer to a specific question he wasn’t asked before.
2882,And incidentally you are also listening to a discredited reporter who has himself clearly stated “don’t believe everything you read”.
2883,"If Fauci (or any other scientist) clarified that their position has changed, I would not be unhappy in the least."
2884,I am however unhappy when comments get taken out of context and the topic goes viral again for no good reason.
2885,"I am here to argue for what I believe is right, yes."
2886,I’m done though.
2887,The truth will come out.
2888,DMV represent!
2889,Wearing a mask can be helpful when dealing with hay fever.
2890,"(Not being sarcastic, it can.)"
2891,"It was probably vasovagal syncope, it’s not a super rare condition."
2892,It’s just good to know you have it so you can warn doctors before you get any needles.
2893,That terminology is poisoned enough that it isn't worth using.
2894,Nobody in this thread has suggested we know one way or the other.
2895,We're waiting on vaccinating kids only because the vaccines aren't approved for them yet.

2910,"When this first broke out, I remember making one negative comment about the Chinese Communist Party to a friend, and she chastised me for racism."

2917,"Why would an Authoritarian Communist ethnostate create a virus that nearly exclusively effects the elderly, obese, and immunocompromised (aka the non-producers)?"

2923,A similar thing happened between physicists and medical sciences.

2957,Too bad the Caps couldn't make it past the first round..I was looking forward to full capacity indoor stadiums next round in DC.

2959,I got the Moderna shot and felt slightly tired for about a day after the second dose.

2990,Crazy how those vaccinated have to go back to office and the ones that don’t give a crap and refuse to get it can stay home- crazy- you better believe that when booster time comes around for next shot I’m saying that I’m not getting it( even though I will) and then I can stay home and no longer have an hour commute each way- shitty how some companies are working this
2991,Never have to ask if someone is vegan... they’ll always tell you.
2992,Never fails!
2993,That’s not including everyone who got cancer later on
2994,I wouldn't say it's hilarious.
2995,"More like sickening, deceitful."
2996,Exactly.
2997,China wouldn't even let them in to see the Wuhan lab for a year.
2998,They're trying to sound relevant.
2999,The whole world hasn't produced enough vaccines to fully vaccinate everyone in India.
3000,People forget how big some of these suffering countries are.
3001,"If the vaccines were spread out evenly across the whole world, they would have barely made a dent."
3002,Okay now respond to my other source where one of the most well known virologists in the world is quoted saying “I change my view”
3003,Most people who get covid don’t die.
3004,"The majority of those who do are the elderly who, if they were going to reproduce, have already done so."
3005,Are you a native English speaker?
3006,With a degree?
3007,Ok then you can move to Japan if you really want to and be a teacher.
3008,"Yeah, I'm even just talking about how many directly make their livelihoods from tourism, but I'm sure either way there's a sector who doesn't want tourists."
3009,I guess it depends if the higher dose means more nanoparticles or not.
3010,My understanding is that encapsulation step is a big bottleneck.
3011,"All the censorship here and on social media about this issue was hilarious under the guise of ""misinformation""."
3012,"Then when that didn't work, everyone straw manned anyone questioning the origin into the crazies that think the virus was genetically created and unleashed on purpose."
3013,"In January, I would have chuckled at that sign and gone in anyway."
3014,"Even now, if it’s just “masks required,” without the “wit,” I’m fine with that."
3015,But that particular one would have annoyed me as well.
3016,I dont see why not.
3017,"US is doing about 1 million second doses a day right now, and needs 20 million more second doses to reach 20 million fully vaccinated by the end of June."
3018,"Which would be about 560,000 per day."
3019,First doses given out per day have also pi key up a bit in the last several days from the opening to kids age 12 and above.
3020,This should prop the 2nd dose rate up in a couple of weeks as those kids need their second doses.
3021,I'd be expecting 160 million fully vaccinated by the end of July.
3022,"It will be a long struggle after that to get a sizeable percentage of the rest of the population vaccinated, though."
3023,"Apart from the age 12-17 kids, the US is running out of people who are enthusiastic about the vaccines and have not yet gotten theirs."
3024,[removed]
3025,Not everyone is looking at the big picture.
3026,"This is largely based off comments in HI news posts though, so probably not getting the most realistic opinions."
3027,[deleted]
3028,They will survive and live to reproduce.
3029,Kids don't get sick enough with COVID let alone die to have a sizable impact on their population.
3030,Yeah that's the exact right approach.
3031,At least give everyone a chance to get fully vaccinated before you open up completely.
3032,I completely agree that we as a culture need to have a discussion about public health messaging and science/health media coverage.
3033,"There is an *astounding* amount of misinformation out there, and I can see how people who aren’t scientifically literate could fall for a bunch of it."
3034,"Not even the wackadoodle anti-vax stuff, things like thinking you can still spread Covid after vaccination, because somebody at the CDC said that instead of saying they didn’t know for sure yet."
3035,"(Even though I’d been following other experts who said the equivalent of “it would be super weird if it didn’t prevent spread.” And thinking masks work better than vaccines, and so on."
3036,"Communication fails all around, and you have to actually look up studies and read them yourself to find good information."
3037,Maybe they should open up who can give vaccinations out then.
3038,"From what I've seen that's the bottle neck, only doctors are allowed (I think)"
3039,Of course it’s very low but considering UK vaccination is going pretty well and these events had major concerns about safety it is a bit too much.
3040,We can imagine running those events without restrictions would be much worse.
3041,[removed]
3042,the genome of the virus does not look like it came from natural evolution.
3043,It came into existence already with infectivity never seen before in nature
3044,"Even though we no longer have mask requirements on the campus I work on, and the new recommendation is that vaccinated people don't need a mask, nearly 100% of people are still masking inside."
3045,I'm vaccinated and no longer wear a mask and honestly it feels weird to be the only person out of 20 in a room without one.
3046,I doubt all of these people were unvaccinated given the ease of availability down here.
3047,"(Florida)

Got a feeling these things will be with us for quite some time just from the inertia."
3048,Is there more of a context for that?
3049,Where is the rest of the conversation?
3050,"Lol they still don’t, in many ways."
3051,This has been a horribly frustrating battle seeing aerosol scientists trying to change the literature and policy in the west regarding airborne spread of Covid.
3052,"I'm all for requiring proof of vaccination before indoor gatherings, but there needs to be some forethought in how to deal with people that can't get the vaccine for legitimate medical reasons, or have a documented adverse reaction to the 1st dose that prevents getting a 2nd dose."
3053,"As a healthy 31 year-old who was eagerly awaiting their 2nd Pfizer dose and a return to normalcy, only to be hospitalized for blood clots the day before my 2nd dose (pulmonary embolism - still scary, but not the same as the rare cerebral clotting disorder from the Janssen vaccine - thank goodness) despite no risk factors or family history, I'm dreading having to have a conversation about my medical history and be treated like an anti-vaxxer to participate in normal life at places requiring proof of vaccination."
3054,"Obviously correlation doesn't equal causation, and I still recommend that everyone get the vaccine despite my experience, but my doctor is advising against getting a 2nd dose because the timing is too coincidental to ignore, and a 2nd dose could be life-threatening if it was indeed the source of my unprecedented blood clotting episode."
3055,"Unfortunately, there doesn't seem to be any way for me to reasonably prove that I'm one of the very few actual cases of a serious adverse event and wanted to get the 2nd dose, but legitimately can't because the 1st one potentially gave me life-threatening blood clots."
3056,I fully understand that doctor's notes can't be trusted after the b.s.
3057,"""I can't wear a mask"" cards people were trying to use, so there really needs to be a way for myself and the other unfortunate souls that did the right thing, got their first dose, and couldn't get the 2nd one because they're the 1 in however many that have a legitimate medical emergency between doses that could have potentially been triggered by the vaccine."
3058,Funny isn't it?
3059,For an entire year you normies and your media overlords censored debate on this issue.
3060,"""What is asserted without evidence can be dismissed without evidence""

China isn't North Korea."
3061,It's nowhere near comparable in difficulty of data collection.
3062,"Furthermore, there's nothing unrealistic about China's claim considering their response and the lack of tests and proper testing methodology."
3063,Fact is that China reacted fast with very effective measures.
3064,"If it was otherwise, you'd have facts backing you up instead of sarcasm."
3065,"Anyway, done discussing with you as you clearly have nothing to offer in the realm of worthwhile information."
3066,"If 100% true that it was being developed as a biological weapon, I’d like war."
3067,I don’t see any other excuse.
3068,"China would be caught lying to the world about a weapon developed in secret with the intent to cause harm, it doesn’t matter if it was an accident that it got released or not."
3069,The pandemic is nearing the end of its main course in high vaccination countries.
3070,Vaccines get the job done.
3071,So we'll be past the point where it can prompt overwhelm the medical system and cause mass fatalities.
3072,"Most people will not be susceptible, at least not to significant illness."
3073,"*However...*

A level of annual circulation comparable to seasonal flu isn't acceptable."
3074,"Besides that future waves would be alongside a returned flu, COVID is far deadlier than flu."
3075,So this would remain a problem in areas without high vaccination rates.
3076,"Not as sharp of a threat, but without a strong, practical treatment, still a deadly one."
3077,"The big difference is that unlike our seasonal flu vaccines, our COVID vaccines are strong enough to suppress that disease on their own."
3078,So long as they continue to work / are updated timely.
3079,If we had a 90%+ effective flu vaccine we wouldn't have flu season.

3081,It’s really not useless as a biological weapon if you believe your society to be far more capable of mitigating the spread than your enemies.
3082,I really do not believe in any way that anyone intentionally released Covid but I have certainly changed my viewpoint on the utility of an intentional release as I have considered it more.
3083,I'm fairly sure moderna currently is doing trials to reduce the amount of RNA in  the vaccines.
3084,"If they get it down yo 30mg like Pfizer, they could presumably sell 3x as many vaccine doses with the existing RNA production infrastructure."
3085,"This would mean they can be more price competitive with Pfizer per dose, and potentially get more orders from developing nations that have got few vaccines so far."

He says almost nothing about the origins, and when he does, he states only facts, and calls for more investigation."

3092,At this point I'm inclined to follow [xkcd's suggestion](https://xkcd.com/2448/) and try to eradicate this virus purely out of spite
3093,"It’s like asking Spain to buy vaccines from a Hispanic distributor based in Mexico, mind-boggling"

3095,"Schedule it for when you have the next day off anyway, and use it as an excuse to eat snacks and watch TV."
3096,I signed up when they told me my age group was opened up and received an email 3 days later for an appointment the next week.
3097,My 13 year old is getting her first shot next week.
3098,I don’t really think it’s been all that bad.
3099,Hilarious seeing the idoits who swallowed the notion that it couldn't possibly be a lab leak doing mental gymnastics to avoid being wrong.
3100,Hard to reach.
3101,Rural America has 30 miles between homes with self sufficient communities.
3102,"I really hope it changes too, but it sounds like they’re fully sticking to their plans from what I’ve seen and heard 😕"
3103,I posted that elsewhere myself.
3104,"It’s not a change in anyone’s opinion, they’ve always insisted on more research."
3105,The lead scientist on that said “ And particularly the comment “Anybody who’s making statements with a high level of certainty about this is just outstripping what’s possible to do with the available evidence”
3106,"For me, it’s not just the vaccination rate alone that matters."
3107,"Case counts in my area are still not down to where they were prior to the beginning of the third wave last November, despite a vaccination rate for age 12+ of over 70% with at least one shot in my county."
3108,Our chief public health officer has said universal masking needs to continue until those rates come down (his expectation is that’s just few more weeks away).
3109,"Not everyone is fortunate enough to live where the virus is plummeting, even in the US; some of us are watching it very slowly crawl downwards or even plateau."
3110,"My guess is that, in many conversations, people confused (1-3) with 4 like:

* **Conspiracy theorist** on Twitter: ""*China created covid to hurt Trum*p"" (suggesting 4)
* **Scientist** replying to them: ""*That's absurd."
3111,"The genome of the virus look to come from natural evolution, it would look differently if it had been purposefully engineered*"" (refuting 4)
* \--&gt; **Average person** sees the exchange on Twitter and remembers ""*the lab theory is absurd*""."
3112,"Three months later:

* **ecuusa**: ""*It's possible that the first human infection happened in a lab*"" (suggesting 1-3)
* **Average person**, misremembering what the scientist said ""*You're a conspiracy theorist, scientists said it was an absurd hypothesi*s"""
3113,maybe the Wizards will
3114,Maybe their employees are not all vaccinated yet.
3115,"A number of people out there will just unmask because they feel like it, even without having been vaccinated."
3116,They might just be protecting their workers.
3117,They're either ill informed or overdoing it.
3118,Hell even the unvaccinated have a pretty low risk outside.
3119,I used to wear mine but after my shots I figured it wasn't necessary anymore outside save for large crowds.
3120,"If an animal was sick at a market, it probably wouldn't have looked healthy/the best option to eat and could have remained there for a few days, possibly infecting other animals who then could have pushed that variety to others when they took them home as well."
3121,"I mean, even in the US, they could be focusing on how best to achieve herd immunity, booster dose research progress, international cooperation to help poorer countries get vaccines etc."
3122,"It doesn't matter what country it is, it is in their benefit to focus on getting shots to as many people as possible."
3123,One mutation that escapes the vaccines would set a lot of things back.
3124,"Well mine is 10, and he's still 100% virtual (he likes it)."
3125,I can't imagine how hard it must have been for parents of daycare age kids!
3126,Mine got sooo many colds when he was in preschool.
3127,"I do know some parents who had to send their toddlers to daycare even earlier in the pandemic though, just because of work, and they did OK."
3128,I think in places like that they will still have to follow pretty strict procedures.
3129,Taiwan is mountainous and if the rain does not fall into the reservoirs they are really hard to catch.
3130,"Wasn't able to find any actual data from this research, anyone has a link?"
3131,"Businesses will still have the power to enforce mask rules for their employees and customers, so I suppose it would depend on where you go."
3132,"Gee, it's almost as if it's easier to give businesses and institutions time to implement new policies and facilitate a transition, or something"
3133,Same here.
3134,My grandma was explicitly told by her doctor to get the Covid vaccine because she's high-risk and the positives vastly outweigh any possible negative side effects.
3135,She refuses.
3136,Her doctor told her she can't get the flu vaccine because of kidney problems and apparently in her mind both vaccinations are equally important.
3137,The smart ones.
3138,People who caught SARS have some protection against COVID and they're only 80% similar.
3139,The new main opinion is that the variants will never be a significant problem to the vaccinated and naturally immune.
3140,"Even if one could get past Pfizer or Moderna, we'd get a cold or no symptoms most likely."
3141,Yep.
3142,The entire nation is doing great right now!
3143,This post appears to be about vaccines.

3149,Everything shut down like a month after her 3rd birthday.
3150,She was lucky she got a birthday party.
3151,Sigh.
3152,It isn’t a bold claim.
3153,Do a search for lab leak theory and read some of the articles from the major publications.
3154,New information has changed the discussion around the origin of the virus.
3155,"If you’d actually read the article, you’d see it is a completely fair summary of why the discussion has changed and links out to other sources."
3156,"It’s getting to be summertime, and we know outdoor transmission almost never happens, so, to me, it sounds like a summer of going to the beach, lake, park, barbecues, etc."
3157,Plan outdoor fun until the under 12 vaccine is approved.
3158,"J&amp;J, get it over with in one shot."
3159,Wow.
3160,That's incredible.
3161,They're getting to numbers low enough that even schools could be mask free.

3168,But he is only 2.
3169,Older kids don’t get this as much.
3170,"I don't think objectively investigating the origin of the virus is in itself racist, unless it was known without a doubt that the lab theory is impossible or infeasible (in which case I would agree it would be racist)."
3171,I am not an expert but it seems that an accidental leak could have been possible.
3172,I think it is important to find the origin of the vaccine so that we can but safeties in place for the future such as closing wet markets if that is where it came from.
3173,I think this can be done objectively and without placing blame on the Chinese people.
3174,"In fact, the SARS 2 genome specifically lacks characteristics of it being genetically engineered, or ""manufactured""."
3175,"That's part of why this theory was initially pushed aside in favor of the natural origins theory, which had the precedent of SARS 1 and MERS to back it up."

3201,Not even college kids.
3202,I just finished my first year of college and me and all of my friends hated remote learning.
3203,*Hated* it.
3204,Sucks even more that we’re paying thousands of dollars for a half ass education.
3205,Thank god normal school is resuming next fall because I would never do the remote learning thing ever again.
3206,Remote learning works for people who *want* remote learning.
3207,Being an older student doesn’t equal “They’re supposed to be more self disciplined so they’ll be fine.” No way.
3208,We’re still students who deserve a high quality education too.
3209,AFAIK it was Hungary.
3210,Malta is already fairly small so it was easy for them to greatly increase their share.
3211,"Denmark also picked up a lot extra, but not enough to much to have a huge impact."
3212,It's frustrating that this happens.
3213,"As a scientist, a problem that we often run up against in public dissemination of info is conveying a message effectively enough to spur a response while also being entirely accurate, at least to the extent possible."
3214,"Of course, uncertainty always exists even in the face of available data, so we always have to add that caveat, and that bites scientists in the ass all too often."
3215,"It almost encourages white lies, which invariably do more damage than good in the end."
3216,"I know but I wasn't talking about the reddit headline, I was talking about the article headline because if you read the article then...it's not what the headline says (to bait the clicks)"
3217,"your children are not at particular risk, at least not in comparison for the flu."
3218,they're not the reason we undertook NPIs as we have.
3219,"They (Taiwan) can get vaccines, they are  just playing politics now."
3220,"Foshun is distribution partner for Pfizer for greater China region (HKG, Macau, China and Taiwan) and will gladly supply Pfizer's vaccine to Taiwan but Taiwan doesn't want to buy from them."
3221,"Well they don't want to get Pfizer from the distributor for their area, so not sure what they expect"
3222,"When I refer to the lab leak theory, I mean a potential for scenarios 1-3, and yet I’ve been called a conspiracy theorist many times."
3223,I’ve never once suggested that China maliciously created or released this virus.
3224,"There are many people like me, including those on this forum, who have been shut down with the same line over and over."
3225,Even the former CDC Director and the former Secretary of State have been called conspiracy theorists.
3226,I’m sure there are people who believe China deliberately released a deadly virus.
3227,But why are they painted as the majority of people who have questions about this theory?
3228,&gt; I repeatedly refer to “stopping discussion” because you have said it’s not important to discuss this right now while we’re still dealing with the pandemic.
3229,Fair enough.
3230,I stand by it.
3231,The number of people I personally know who passed away with covid went from 1 to 13 in the last 3 weeks.
3232,People are begging for vaccines and hospital beds.
3233,So I dont care about how it started now.
3234,No one investigates who started a fire when the building is literally burning is all I am saying.
3235,That is not anti- investigation.
3236,&gt; But there’s a difference between baseless speculation and asking questions.

3240,"Being the parent of not 1 but 2 high school kids, remote has been amazing for us."

3292,There's plenty to criticize without making shit up.
3293,"Also, it's important to get your facts straight when criticizing."
3294,"The doctor in question, Li Wenliang, didn't ""alert the world"" (he actually sent messages to a private chat group and specifically asked members not to share the information outside of the group) and he was not ""imprisoned"" (he was actually warned by the police for spreading false rumors about confirmed SARS cases)."
3295,"Most importantly for this discussion, this was clearly a result of the local authorities trying to suppress the panic and cover their arses, and not of some grand scheme by the Chinese state to cover up the outbreak."
3296,"In just a few weeks after Li was interrogated, all the local officials were dismissed, and Li and other ""rumor-mongers"" were publicly exonerated by the supreme court of China."
3297,What really should be criticized here is the system which causes the local officials to be sycophants whose first instinct is to hush up things and cover their own arses rather than do the right thing for the public good.
3298,I don’t believe anything that the WHO says about covid.
3299,How do you respond to family saying they’re gonna wait a while until the get the vaccine?
3300,You really should not spread the falsehood that rand paul is pushing about getting the virus once makes you immune because there is no evidence that it makes you immune the same way the vaccines do.

3354,What else are they like?

3367,Im a huge conspiracy theorist on this and I think it was the Chinese bat lady either by purpose or accident.
3368,Two people died in a coal mine in china in 2016.
3369,She went to go investigate and found it was sars like and the two patients ended up dying.
3370,She did research at wuhan lab with the samples and conducted gain of research on the virus for either legit research or biological warfare which made it more contagious.
3371,Virus got released on purpose or by accident.
3372,"If on purpose, we got a bit lucky that those two patients died because the virus doesn't have a a bigger mortality rate."
3373,Maybe they overlooked the miners lungs and thought the virus was really deadly since it killed both of them?
3374,Or same as above but it was legit research except the virus leaked.
3375,Either way why the fuck are we mutating virus' that can cause pandemics to learn how to battle them.
3376,Especially if it can literally wipe us all out.
3377,Ps im not a nut i just like exploring the non popular opinion.
3378,Lol
3379,"I'm with you on that one, by definition the mutation that allows it to penetrate human cells is going to have something that looks like it's there to penetrate human cells."
3380,Kind of feels like an intelligent design argument.
3381,"Zillions of viruses mutating constantly, the one in a billion that breaks through clearly can only have been designed to do so?"
3382,And the fact it's so contagious means it never wasn't so contagious?
3383,Because all that is warranted is further investigation if there is no clinical influence or application.
3384,It says so right in the article and quotes.

3406,"Hopefully at some point we will all have a more concrete answer, the entire world deserves to know all that's possible to know about it."
3407,All the research shows that natural infection + one dose (usually 3-6 months later in the research) gives higher protection than two doses without infection.
3408,I don't see why you'd turn down paid time off though.
3409,Just curious as to what vaccine you got?
3410,I am so sorry that you guys are sick.

3441,"moderna:

&gt; The Company is also announcing new positive interim Phase 1 data from its Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV) vaccine candidate (mRNA-1345) 

&gt; Today, the Company is sharing the first interim analysis of the Phase 1 study of mRNA-1345, through 1-month post-vaccination, of the younger adult cohorts."
3442,A single mRNA-1345 vaccination of 50 μg (N=19) or 100 μg (N=20) was generally well-tolerated in younger adults (ages 18-49 years).
3443,Ten participants received placebo.
3444,"The most common local solicited adverse reaction was injection site pain, and the most common systemic solicited adverse reactions were headache, fatigue and myalgia."
3445,The majority of solicited adverse reactions occurred within 1-3 days after vaccination and resolved after 1-4 days.
3446,"There were no deaths, no severe adverse events, no study discontinuations due to adverse events, and no adverse events that led to a study pause."
3447,&gt; mRNA-1345 was shown to increase RSV neutralizing antibodies in seropositive younger adults.
3448,"Neutralizing antibodies were confirmed to be present at baseline in all participants, as expected."
3449,A single vaccination of mRNA-1345 at the 50 or 100 μg dose level boosted neutralizing antibody titers against both serotypes of RSV-A and RSV-B with no apparent dose response.
3450,"At month 1, the geometric mean fold rise in neutralizing antibody relative to baseline was at least 20.5 for RSV-A and at least 11.7 for RSV-B."
3451,"&gt; At the 100 μg dose level, the geometric mean fold rise (95% CI) in RSV-A neutralizing antibody titer at month 1 relative to baseline was 2.7 (2.1, 3.4) with mRNA-1777, the Company’s previous RSV vaccine candidate, compared to 21.0 (13.9, 31.8) with mRNA-1345."
3452,"Both mRNA-1777 and mRNA-1345 encode for the prefusion RSV-F.

3483,"But with the CDC saying it wasn't man-made and fearing a new strain just a month ago to now suddenly suggesting we ease back on masks and now saying we should question the origins when his new boss is also pro getting back to work and anti China, it's super hard not to think this sudden change in approach isn't politically influenced."

3544,"Anecdotally our president and my uncle got covid after being fully vaccinated, but symptoms were very mild."

3628,Moderna and Pfizer are on par as the best vaccines in the world and are both significantly better than AstraZeneca’s
3629,"And by 6/15, some teens will be close to fully vaccinated too!"
3630,Mine will be a week and a half past her second dose!
3631,This is so stupidly annoying.
3632,"Even if you don't meet the **herd immunity threshold** where something can be eradicated, there is still a ton of value in **partial herd immunity,** akin to what we accomplish with influenza vaccines."
3633,"We shouldn't forget about it, we should just understand what it means."
3634,"I don’t know, I’m not disagreeing."
3635,I saw news articles about it and that’s all I could think that he may be referring to.

3647,don't pretend thats not where we're heading lmao
3648,"Exactly, it’s on par with Pfizer as the best vaccine in the world and in general a lot better than AZ."
3649,"Pfizer is a German vaccine and has a lot more use outside the US, so has a lot more studies associated with it"
3650,Serial interval is the number of days between transmissions.
3651,"Say this was ALWAYS exactly 4 days, then with an R(t)=2 then every 4 days cases would double."
3652,"Every week, they'd rise by 2^7/4 = +236%."
3653,"Or if you want to reverse it, since we have cases dropping weekly to 76% of their previous value, you'd have R(t) = 0.76^4/7 = 0.855."
3654,But where does that value of 4 come from?
3655,"What if it's 3.5, or 5, or 8 instead?"
3656,Then that math just completely changes.
3657,The weekly change is a known value (though smoothed since we have cases coming in on certain days and lagging a while behind infections).
3658,"But the serial interval isn't really known, so we can't ""really"" know R(t) either."
3659,This makes calculations like the herd immunity threshold difficult.
3660,With a more complicated model you can come up with this in other ways; for instance if B.1.1.7 is a fixed amount more contagious than B.1 then you can adjust your serial interval until that amount is the same across all R(t) values found in different countries.
3661,And it's actually far more complicated than that.
3662,"There's no reason to believe the serial interval is even a constant - it could vary greatly depending on how many people get sick leave, for instance."
3663,"And of course it's not a single value at all, but a distribution over time."
3664,And the combined effect of that distribution is not the same as just taking an algebraic average - it's more like solving the Fibonacci series.
3665,The actual number of 3.96 that I quoted comes from [this paper](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/26/6/20-0357_article).

3676,No.
3677,"They clearly and unquestionably said that the unvaccinated need to remain masked and that everyone needs to be masked in mass transit, hospitals, schools, prisons, and homeless shelters."
3678,I agree and I find it somewhat annoying that people keep saying that like it’s some sort of justification for categorically denying the scenario was possible when knowing that it was.
3679,The republicans can be kind of be right for the wrong reasons.
3680,That isn’t an excuse to for us to rule out a plausible answer.

3685,Different efficacies though.
3686,AstraZeneca is only 60% effective against the variant compared with 88% for Pfizer
3687,"Also their absurdly long and stubborn denial that it’s an airborne disease (and refusal to even admit it was a possibility worth investigating), despite significant evidence and pressure from other scientists."

3700,I would hope that adults in Texas catch up on their vaccinations as well.
3701,I wonder how many future movies will be set in Pandemic America.
3702,Partition is the only thing that come close in Independent India IMO.
3703,However partition was largely confined to Punjab and the north.
3704,It barely made a dent elsewhere.
3705,In that sense this has made more of a dent as it has affected poor and rich in every corner of the country.
3706,A lot of people in the Punjabi community still carry the scars of partition-just extrapolate this to every single community and state in India.
3707,They are.
3708,I fly United.

3748,"If it was an accidental lab leak, though, there's almost no denying that their response to it was malicious action against the rest of the world."
3749,"Rather than lock down immediately and take the economic hit themselves, they decided to keep it under wraps for a few months and let it spread to the rest of the world so they wouldn't be the only ones to suffer from it."

3754,Here is the [timeline of the WHO's activities.
3755,"](https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/interactive-timeline)

What should they have done differently and when?"
3756,"I too would like to hear Germiphone's answer, but my opinion is that they have not ""stewarded the global view pretty well."""
3757,"It took them a year to acknowledge airborne transmission even though it was clear from contact studies as early as April 2020, and still barely acknowledges the all-important environmental factors of spread while emphasizing things like hand washing which have little to no efficacy against COVID."
3758,Recent evidence indicates they simply went with old generic health guidance and didn't update it out of institutional hubris.
3759,"I can't speak to the political pressures they may have had vis China, which may be what Germiphene is talking about, but my view is there is much to criticize about the WHO's handling of this, though it's probably ahead of the curve to say so."
3760,"The debate was not if it was respiratory, it was about the technicality of if the virus spread in aerosol vs droplets."
3761,Droplets are bigger and just spread 6ft and drop quickly to the ground in seconds after a coughing.
3762,They then linger on surfaces.
3763,"(Influenza is more like this)

Aerosol is smaller and lingers in the air for minutes after coughing and can spread over 10-20ft."
3764,(Common cold is like this)
3765,It's not really surprising that we have a bit of a long tail with this.
3766,"Vaccines slowing down, restrictions lifting, people loosening up, etc."
3767,"But even with decreasing vax numbers, there are still several things that will keep putting downward pressure on the numbers."
3768,"Still a lot of people getting vaccinated, still a lot of people not at full immunity (2 weeks post-2nd shot) that will be soon, kids getting vaccinated, and the unvaccinated catching it and getting immunity that way."
3769,"Might be a long slow descent from here, but that's fine."
3770,They'll be looking great in a month.
3771,The numbers are already better than they've been basically the entire pandemic.
3772,"Get vaccinated, live life."
3773,This is fantastic!
3774,"I been saying it was fishy for over a year, always got downvoted to shit"
3775,"I appreciate your post because ultimately R0 if it's under 1 in theory this thing goes away more or less, outside of the imported cases."
3776,"Seems like what will raise transmission is the opening up and lifting of mandates, and I think most are OK with that so long as it doesn't increase spread too much."
3777,"Seems like what will lower transmission is the continuing vaccination, and we have a lot of protection already built into the curve."
3778,Appreciate the well thought out post.
3779,"When you say, ""The actual R(t) depends on the serial interval between transmissions which is just guessed at (the CDC has a study that shows an algebraic average of 3.96, for instance"" - what do you mean?"

3933,You’ve (we all have) just been given permission to think
3934,Being a walking 5G hotspot sure has been convenient these past few weeks.
3935,Yeah maybe it’s amazing we all became PhD‘s in virology but really was more amazing is that the existing epidemiologists and medical doctors and PhD‘s in virology decided to dismiss the lab leak hypothesis and decided a whole bunch of stupid ass things that armchair quarterbacks figured out just by thinking freely about it.
3936,To me that’s more amazing
3937,"Sure, but at a certified point we have to normalize that it'll be okay to be unmasked."
3938,"However, I understand courtesy."
3939,And will continue to mask up when required as I despise people who throw tantrums.
3940,"To be fair to those who no longer mask outside, the science IS very positive whether you are vaccinated, or not, about the low risk of transmission."
3941,So hopefully we will help people be comfortable with outside masklessness soon.
3942,The DMV also has one of the most highly educated populations per capita in the US.
3943,Hmmm...
3944,I'm with you.
3945,Vaccinated people aren't a risk to non-vaccinated people.
3946,&gt; The only thing I would add is that these numbers are far too small to interpret in any meaningful way.
3947,"For example, when you say...

&gt; &gt;only two adverse events occurred within the J&amp;J group

&gt; ...you mean only two out of the three women who both received the vaccine and became pregnant, so a 66% chance of adverse effects?"
3948,But these numbers are orders of magnitude too small to determine any kind of causal link here.
3949,Very good point.
3950,"I agree, the numbers are too small to determine anything."
3951,&gt; What were the minimum ages included in the studies?
3952,"This is my main point, the effects on children haven't been tested yet we're advocating en masse vaccination of children in a very short period of time."
3953,"Seems for Moderna it was 18 (page 20 in the document of the previous comment), for Pfizer it was 16 (page 20), and for J&amp;J it was 18 (page 21)."
3954,"It seems there isn't a lot of data currently for infants and young children, however Pfizer did a phase 3 trial on participants aged 12-15, with 2,260 total participants."
3955,[They say side effects were consistent with those age 16+.
3956,"They also still did the two month follow-up for the participants, however it seems they only monitored over half of the participants for that two month period instead of all the participants."
3957,"Only 2,260 people were included in the study, versus the 43,651 total in the 16+ trial."
3958,](https://www.fda.gov/news-events/press-announcements/coronavirus-covid-19-update-fda-authorizes-pfizer-biontech-covid-19-vaccine-emergency-use) Make of that information what you will.
3959,I'm just a teen so I'm not knowledgeable enough to speak much on it.
3960,"Moderna also stated in a [press release that in an initial analysis of a trial for those aged 12-17, that their vaccine showed 96% efficacy and no safety concerns identified to date."
3961,"3,235 people were enrolled in this trial, and they had a median safety follow-up of 35 days."
3962,"](https://investors.modernatx.com/news-releases/news-release-details/moderna-reports-first-quarter-fiscal-year-2021-financial-results)

I hear Pfizer has started a phase 2 and 3 trial for ages six months to 11 years old, however I couldn't find a direct statement from Pfizer about it and I don't believe they've released the information from those trials yet."
3963,They may still be monitoring the participants right now if they have administered the doses already.
3964,"I believe the US has still been monitoring children aged 12-15 who have gotten the Pfizer vaccine for safety, and they have not seen any major issues propping up yet."
3965,"To speak to how precise their monitoring systems are, the government was able to detect a blood clotting issue that affected 6 people with the J&amp;J vaccine, and put a hold on that vaccine until they found a way to identify and treat it, so I assume if there were issues now they would have detected them already."
3966,Seems their safety monitoring systems are quite precise if they can detect a 6 in several million occurrence (I'm not sure exactly how many people got the J&amp;J vaccine when they detected those cases).
3967,Do you think the people who would care about that appeal to protect your children aren't already vaccinated?
3968,This person not wearing a mask isn't a threat to your kids.
3969,Point your angst and pity at the douchebags who are actually a problem.
3970,"I think I heard the same thing - perhaps it has something to do with the virus jumping from animal species to humans so easily, so quickly."
3971,"I don’t know for sure, but I’d suggest that you can research it and find out Probably with 30 minutes doing a search on YouTube."
3972,[deleted]
3973,"FYI there was an interview on On The Media this last weekend with a researcher who mentioned that the only ""live"" animals at that market were frogs and some other non-COVID-carrying small animals."
3974,"There were no live animals at that market cable of carrying or transmitting this type of corona virus, nor had there been in the recent days/weeks."
3975,The only animals at that market with COVID19 were humans.
3976,Are they arguing against lab leak or a against a virus made synthetically from the ground up?
3977,The article wasn't more than 3 paragraphs so it wasn't at all clear.
3978,"If a virus isolated from bats in a cave is then brought to a lab where it infects a researcher due to poor lab technique, is the virus no longer of natural origin?"
3979,"I'm wondering at what point a virus becomes ""not of natural origin"" and what conspiracy theories the scientists are saying are baseless."

3986,"It adds nothing but it is an useful resource to bring up outside actual argumentation, since it clears up the ""USA good, China bad"" stigma, so you'll humble down some people right away."
3987,In my opinion it is surprisingly helpful to bring everyone to the same level so they present objective arguments.

3997,"&gt;why ... were the Chinese not allowing the WHO in to examine for more than an year

Citation required."
3998,Exactly!
3999,It has been pretty much forbidden to suggest a “lab leak hypothesis” - anyone you talk to will cite some experts who dismissed it!
4000,"I hope more people will check out Bret Weinstein - he is a biologist, and he makes really compelling points about the need for us to properly investigate the lab leak hypothesis."
4001,No conclusions made - he just says let’s look at it - without being “cancelled” or called a nutbar.

4008,"Would be nice if people who did it right and got vax'd as soon as they were eligible got a ""prize""."
4009,Whatever.
4010,I guess I'd rather get the world just return to normal than free airfare at this time.
4011,We have had news like that under the hood in Europe.
4012,Sweden in the first wave simply did not take elderly patients into the hospitals and left them with inadequate treatment dying in the nursery homes.
4013,In my country a ton of old people died in the second wave in the nursery homes because there survival rate in the icu world have been zero.
4014,In both cases triage never was official but it was implemented.
4015,"Guess the same happened in the uk, you just never heard about it."
4016,They specifically said they wanted to inform people of the personal risk to them on the individual level.
4017,"But that the question of who actually needs to be masked up isn’t their call, and is up to local leaders and businesses."
4018,"And a big hole in the “there’s no risk to me, I’m vaccinated, I never need to wear masks” idea is that the CDC is still requiring EVERYONE to wear masks in mass transit, schools, prisons, and hospitals."
4019,"So basically, no, the cdc is not saying you’re done with masks."
4020,"They said you’re safe, but you still may need to."
4021,So you're saying that New York lifting their restrictions soon after the CDC issued the new guidance is a sign that they want to see people die?
4022,Is that really where you're going with this?

4027,Wuhan is one of the biggest cities in the world.
4028,"All you need is one person from Wuhan to travel to Yunnan, bring home the virus, and spread it to others asymptomatically via public transit, indoor dining, etc."
4029,"You’re not infectious immediately after infection, so there’s time to return to Wuhan without infecting anyone, especially if driving a private vehicle."
4030,Full contact tracing would be impossible in many cases before lockdowns.
4031,"The cdc flat out said, if you are vaccinated, you do not need to wear a mask."
4032,Obviously it is up to the local and state government.
4033,But they didn’t caveat it with anything about checking vaccine cards or any horse shit that you just made up.
4034,They cited studies from Israel that basically concluded that vaccinated people do not become sick with symptomatic or asymptomatic covid.
4035,And are not much of a thread to spread the disease.
4036,So they concluded vaccinated people do not need to wear masks.
4037,That’s indiana.
4038,And one of the world's most respected medical journals didn't bat an eye in publishing it.
4039,I wonder why trust in science is eroding.

4041,You’re not doing anything wrong.

4043,"For some people more than others, it’ll take time to adjust."
4044,Last year (and still now) some people were literally claiming they had proof it was a lab leak.
4045,I've seen a few of the posts that were removed or tagged.
4046,"They were crap, full of unsubstantiated claims."
4047,"These sort of things literally are rumors, misinformation, and conspiracy theories."
4048,"On the other hand, saying we have no evidence pointing there but still can't rule it out is not a ""claim""."

4087,"It was fun fighting with people while it lasted, but now, I'm gonna pave my own way"
4088,You’re gonna get some bullshit how the flu kills a bunch of kids every year and we don’t mask for them and blah blah blah but they fail to realize that increasing risk is additive and sometimes calls for increased safety measures.
4089,Otherwise we could keep adding more viruses that kill a few hundreds kids at a time and never do anything about it.
4090,At some point you need to take action.
4091,Masks are easy.

4123,I haven’t been sick for nearly three years so it was a nice change
4124,I don’t take issue with a simple appeal to authority.
4125,I take issue with blindly following authority.
4126,"In this example, an authority figure said A, and a person misrepresented them to mean B."
4127,Then they proceeded to appeal to authority to support B.
4128,This misunderstanding occurred because the person did not try to understand the expert’s logic—they just wanted the expert to tell them yes or no.
4129,They wanted someone to follow.
4130,It seems like that is what so many people want.

4151,Why do you seem to think those are 2 mutually exclusive positions?

they were experimenting with gain of function on corona viruses there though."
4175,it's possible it was engineered there and leaked accidentally.
4176,&gt; I don’t understand why reddit gets such a hard-on for scientists.
4177,My theory is that among a certain kind of liberal it's a replacement for religion.
4178,This often takes the form of what has been labeled scientism.
4179,"This worship of science lends support to the political narrative that liberals are on the side of objective truth while those racist, homophobic, idiot Republicans wallow in the darkness of superstition and ignorance."
4180,This allows this kind of liberal to arrogantly dismiss all criticism as conspiracy theory and clothe themselves in moral purity.
4181,"I find it ironic how everyone loves to talk about the ""political pressure"" from China but not the political pressure from the US to other countries to go full throttle disinformation assault about Covid-19 to China."

4187,"I’m not sure who’s telling the truth and who is using an excuse but I’m pretty sure the EU mentioned back in April they had authorised the export of over 50 mil doses to Japan, which at the time caused a frustration in the Japanese population as the government kept saying they had no supplies."

4192,"yeah it's funny how that theory is fucking ridiculous for months and then as soon as Fauci makes one comment, it's suddenly entirely plausible."
4193,I've confessed a few times that I'm on the fence about the origin and I've been laughed out of the sub on every occasion.
4194,Masks and restrictions got brought back for FIVE cases.
4195,That’s crazy to me how that compares with the US.
4196,&gt; Then they appeal to authority.
4197,"As a side note, thats not fallacious here."
4198,Appeal to authority is really only fallacious when its outside the authorities area of expertise (ignoring cherry picking).
4199,People often presume they can fully comprehend a subject area in far less time than is truly needed to master it.
4200,"If LSV says a magic card is bad in limited, it probably is, and that fact probably carries more weight than any argument I could make."
4201,"If LSV says to buy silver, well that aint his area of expertise so its fallacious."

4207,We just need to crank out as many doses as we can and help get the surplus doses to anybody anywhere in the world who will accept them.
4208,Because there’s fewer vaccinations during the weekend...
4209,Don't bring perspective into Reddit when someone is trying to be low-key racist /s.
4210,A buddy of mine who is from the Philippines messaged me today to catch up.
4211,He said he and his girlfriend got to the vaccination site today at 5am to stand in line for her to get her first shot.
4212,He couldn't even get his because he doesn't have any health issues.
4213,He was so thankful that she got hers because she has chronic health conditions and is at risk with covid.

4229,"It went on for weeks, then a few hours news about the genetic analysis of the origin, then … nothing."
4230,Drop da bomb?
4231,"By the time a winter wave comes around, I'm sure our kids will be vaccinated."
4232,"If not, hopefully enough 12+ in your area are vaxxed to mostly stop the spread."
4233,"If there are too many people not vaxxed to stop a wave, bad news, it's not like those same morons are going to willingly put on a mask instead of just lie about their vaccination status."
4234,At that point the best you can do is keep your kids out of harm's way when the wave gets bad.
4235,Manaos...The Hands of Fate
4236,And here....we...go.
4237,Why America?
4238,&gt; what he conflated is that therefore we were involved in creating the virus which is the most ridiculous majestic leap I've ever heard of.
4239,Fauci has such an eloquent way of calling Rand Paul an ignorant ophthalmologist.
4240,Some of us are more concerned with keeping people alive.
4241,I'll never understand childish people like you.
4242,73% of Americans are at least overweight.
4243,42.4% of American adults are considered obese.
4244,And 10% are morbidly obese.
4245,"Considering what we know about this virus, I'm not surprised this virus has as much of an impact as it did on America."
4246,I'm actually surprised it didn't have a bigger one.
4247,"So to answer your question, no."
4248,"A lot of people's two weeks from their second shot isn't up yet, especially if they had 4 weeks between shots."
4249,I'm looking forward to going around mask free next week :)
4250,Also hard to get the truth from the country that lies constantly.
4251,I wish they will look into this more but it don't suit their propaganda so better to just sweep it under the carpet as usual.
4252,"""Researchers found **coronavirus antibodies in 39 samples from California, Oregon, and Washington as early as Dec. 13 to Dec. 16**."
4253,"They also discovered **antibodies in 67 samples from Connecticut, Iowa, Massachusetts, Michigan, Rhode Island, and Wisconsin in early January** — before widespread outbreaks in those states."""
4254,https://www.npr.org/sections/coronavirus-live-updates/2020/12/01/940395651/coronavirus-was-in-u-s-weeks-earlier-than-previously-known-study-says
4255,They wear masks outside and then go to a pub and karaoke maskless all night.
4256,My understanding is everyone has an order to attend a vaccine clinic.
4257,"Whether you get a jab or not is up to you, but you have to go there."
4258,"&gt; I think this person's point is that, while things are getting better, we're not out of the woods yet."
4259,I am.
4260,I’m vaccinated
4261,And bomb sniffing dogs.
4262,Marylander here.
4263,My whole family is vaxxed... except 1
4264,Guess he never read about Luke and what he did when he wasn't writing?
4265,Nice to have good news from Texas.
4266,It took them like 15 years to confirm the origin of SARS
4267,"It’s not so much impacting to China, they can worm their way out of this with a little political rhetoric and public executions (firings)."
4268,It is however highly impacting to a subset of the world of Virology.
4269,New rules and limitations and some risky research shut down that has a lot of money behind it.
4270,[removed]
4271,That's one explanation for Texas.
4272,Another is that people in Texas were spending less time indoors earlier than most other parts of the country (say Michigan).
4273,"Yes, of course natural immunity counts as well."
4274,We just don't know how much it counts.
4275,"If you're 25 it probably doesn't matter, if you're 65 it seems like a dumb risk."
4276,I don’t understand why reddit gets such a hard-on for scientists.
4277,Maybe if they all went to grad school they would see how flawed and corrupt academia can be.
4278,"For example, Elizabeth Holmes studied at Stanford and even did research on SARS CoV-1 in Singapore, and everyone agrees that she was a complete fraud."
4279,"The combined capacity of these ""mass"" vaccination centers is 15,000 per day."
4280,That's only 1.5% of their daily goal.
4281,They really need to open more.
4282,[deleted]
4283,Nothing to do with Trump.
4284,"The topic was censored before Trump ever mentioned it, and censored long after Trump was banned from Twitter."
4285,"This situation does not concern Trump, he dipped his toes in but failed to do anything of substance."
4286,Have they culled their people or did we cull our people after China decided against doing that?
4287,This should’ve been investigated early last year when the evidence first emerged.
4288,You can’t let the building burn down and take all the evidence with it either.
4289,Medical experts can handle the virus in its last phases.
4290,The intel community and international community can handle an investigation about exactly wtf happened in Hubei.
4291,And there is strong evidence to suggest it came from the wuhan institute of virology.
4292,They were studying bat corona viruses there.
4293,That lab was 3 football fields away from the market.
4294,That lab also has multiple job postings that were up at the end of 2019 asking for help to come research a new coronavirus.
4295,They knew it was human to human transmissible at the end of December and didn’t lock the country down until January 23.
4296,By the end of December multiple people from that research team were sick.
4297,None of this is new information and was available no less than 13 months ago.
4298,For some reason it’s not getting traction until now.
4299,"No, it would be a reason to call them ""Terrorists"", get torches and pitchforks and retaliate on the Japanese people living in everybody's countries."
4300,I don’t doubt that you feel that way.
4301,"I haven’t seen any actual concerning statistics regarding kids to warrant that type of opinion though, and society as well as the CDC have come to the same conclusion."
4302,But also the wuhan market.. what are the odds that the virus came from there?
4303,Very high.
4304,Virologists called that place (and others like it) heaven for viruses and diseases.
4305,I wish more people realized that Fauci’s current position is more politics than science.he’s akin to a CEO or company President
4306,dr flipflop
4307,No one will be heartbroken if you don’t reproduce.
4308,"I’m taking you sincerely, the reason people are so concerned is that the kind of research that was going on at WIV was predicted by many in the biosafety community to pose a high risk of causing pandemics and argued that it was not worth the risk."
4309,"Despite this, China has since increased their bio lab count *in response to* COVID and many of the proponents of this controversial research have been using Covid to beg for even more funding and expanded projects."
4310,"If this was a lab leak and it was proven as such, it would provide the political pressure needed to shut down much of this risky research and quite possibly prevent the next or even next several pandemics (saving millions of lives in the process.)"
4311,This of course from the perspective of someone who thinks the type of work going on in these labs is not worth the risk to humanity.
4312,Some people argue not performing this work would lead to pandemics- it’s a controversial topic.
4313,You know what’s a good goalpost?
4314,Not being in a pandemic.
4315,"Japan can’t handle the current hospitalizations,less than one percent of the population has been vaccinated."
4316,Who exactly is going to show up and cheer?
4317,I’m sorry that it’s come to this but even the Japanese people don’t want it according to numerous polls
4318,Would have been a godsend for me but I understand it's not for everyone
4319,This is false.
4320,The demand right now is off the charts.
4321,In Hokkaido they had over 25k people queued in an online reservation system yesterday 27 seconds after the website opened.
4322,The biggest telecom company had to throttle lines because of fears that calls to make appointments would crash the country's telephone system.
4323,They had to close in-person reservation centers because the lines of elderly people was causing traffic issues and became a health hazard with all the crowding.
4324,People are desperately trying to get appointments but the daily capacity is incredibly low because they don't have a fast and effective way to get people vaccinated.
4325,"Thank you, I think so too."
4326,WHO don't just make proclamations based on whenever they feel it is expedient or based on opinion.
4327,"They wait for data, and studies, and then make a decision."
4328,This takes time.
4329,The aerosol issue was an on-going issue that they finally have some data for.
4330,This was the same reason they took so long to call it a pandemic.
4331,To be a pandemic it must meet certain criteria.
4332,"[https://www.who.int/bulletin/volumes/89/7/11-088815/en/](https://www.who.int/bulletin/volumes/89/7/11-088815/en/)

The coronavirus took time to move and infect other countries."
4333,It was the same reason they took so long to confirm human to human transmission.
4334,Once the scientists confirmed it did they confirm H2H transmission.
4335,I clearly remember people were on their case to declare H2H transmission before they had any confirmation of it.
4336,Science takes time.
4337,We either want science and data backed information or we want random wahoo to just make random proclamation without evidence.
4338,"In this sense, WHO will always be behind the curve, just as ALL these scientists and doctors have been consistently behind the curve over this pandemic."
4339,It took all of last year just to figure out what the actual symptoms were for Covid-19.
4340,[removed]
4341,"I think the issue is hubris and arrogance, it's a good idea to figure out how to battle future covid viruses only if you can very securely make sure they can't escape the lab."
4342,"That lab was found unsafe by several inspectors before Covid-19 hit, but of course they kept at it."
4343,"I was 100% obsessed with Covid-19 in mid-Jan when it first hit China and some of the videos where leaking out, people thought I was nuts even thinking it would hit North America, especially here on Reddit."
4344,[deleted]
4345,Pretty sure that was the media and those reacting to him.
4346,"if it were a biowepon, it would have been much worse, but it wouldn't spread that far."
4347,"bioweapons are ment to be fairly lethal, but fairly local as to avoid ""friendly fire""."
4348,"&amp;#x200B;

it probably started in china because its hot, densely populated, and a good percentage of the world lives there."
4349,"so its more likely for the virus to pop up, where the most people are."
4350,"hot also helps spread covid, because air conditioning recircs the virus, also chemical reactions happen faster when warm, so maybe viruses form faster."
4351,idk
4352,They are doing a bit better.
4353,5% of population now with one dose and vaccinations ramping--should start rolling soon
4354,I’m watching these people take shots but I’m like...both are bad.
4355,Both are pretty bad.
4356,Don't know why this needs to be debunked over and over and over again on this sub.
4357,"The majority of people who got infected were UN-vaccinated, and when you do the math, it shows the vaccine (Chinese vaccine) was about 65-70% effective---which is literally same or higher than expected."
4358,"Also, it still reduced hospital + deaths."
4359,"This does NOT prove:

\-The Pfizer/Moderna vaccines will run into the same problem

\-This is a ""warning"" to other countries

etc etc etc

Just downvote this article, basically"
4360,Go read the article I linked.
4361,"I thought this community would really like it, it's quite fascinating!"
4362,In a few months we’ll be a lot closer to herd immunity or the 70-80% vaccinated goal that is commonly suggested.
4363,Especially since kids can be vaccinated around sept. That’s how the immunocompromised will likely have to be protected.
4364,I guess I should just admit that I invented the coronavirus.
4365,I was just real drunk and don't remember how.
4366,My bad guys.
4367,"Reading that gave me a warm feeling inside, like everything is actually gonnna be okay."
4368,Both can be bad .. ?
4369,Is it possible that If I take 1st dose of covishield (india variant) And the 2nd dose of astrazeneca (English variant)
4370,"&gt; I’d do it just to save 100 kids which could end up being how many die

That would be more kids than who died from covid from March 1st to December 12th, 2020 ages 0-10.

4374,Only 82 died from Covid.
4375,"Even if all 456 kids admitted to the ICU had long-term symptoms, it's simply not that many."
4376,"People claimed that it must come out of a lab ""because the Chinese do thee things""."
4377,Asians were beaten on the streets.
4378,Why get in the way of anti-american rhetoric on reddit?
4379,That’s a downdoot from me sir.
4380,I've read there's a good chance that the mRNA technology used to make the Covid vaccines may be used to produce better vaccines for other diseases including the flu in the future.
4381,Flu season may indeed be suppressed below levels we're used to if that happens.
4382,"&gt; a few months longer

Lol they don’t stop being immunocompromised in a few months."
4383,If the vaccine doesn’t work on them now it’s not gonna in a few months.
4384,And we aren’t going to get to zero covid in a few months (or frankly ever if New Zealand’s four lockdowns are any indicator)
4385,Weird.
4386,"When this was brought up by Trump, whistleblowers and other doctors, it was laughed at."
4387,Dismissed.
4388,Now .... bam.
4389,Fauci has changed his mind so many times that it isn’t funny.
4390,It’s a small piece of a larger picture.
4391,"Do all the pieces add up to warrant masking for another few months until we’ve reached the 70-80% vaccinated that was commonly suggested, or until around sept when kids can be vaccinated?"
4392,I think it does.
4393,I’d do it just to save 100 kids which could end up being how many die.
4394,I’d do it to save tens of thousands of adults.
4395,Or save everyone higher insurance premiums or higher taxes from Medicare paying for hospitalizations.
4396,Or risking mutations that could evade our vaccines.
4397,"Bulgaria has extreme vaccine hesitancy, if not just outright antivax.."
4398,"If you thought that the US plateaued too early, just compare it to their 11%."
4399,I saw one poll which said something like 50% of Bulgarians think that Covid is a hoax and just a way for governments to exert control.
4400,[removed]
4401,Lol where do you see the 10%-30% (itself a rather drastic range anyways) number?
4402,The lancet article here cites 250 cases unless I am misreading

4416,The most impactful parts of high school for me were not the things that happened in class.
4417,It might give US and its allies a moral justification to go against China.
4418,"Right now, China is the global factory of the world."
4419,"Cutting off China will be akin to shooting at our own foot ; it will devastate economies, which were already in precarious position given the Pandemic."

4424,Only makes sense that you vaccinate your own first.
4425,I had that metallic taste after the first pfizer.
4426,The people I know with more severe side effects (flu-like) were usually moderna but most everyone from either group felt crummy the next day and then fine following that.

4429,"However, if it wasn't true Texas would be doing a lot worse right now than they are."
4430,So you can pretty much deduce that natural immunity counts toward the goal as well.
4431,Asia is so late with covid vaccinations
4432,I agree.
4433,It’s also incorrect to insinuate because of that unknown it warrants more mask mandates or restrictions.
4434,"&gt;  But you're also irrational if you believe, without evidence, that it developed naturally."
4435,Either way you're just picking the conclusion you want based on zero available evidence.

Okay thanks for your opinion."

4451,We wouldn’t want you to inconvenience yourself with a mask for a few months longer or anything horrible like that.
4452,"Why is this tagged ""good news""?"
4453,In Feb/March a surge in cases was occurring in Michigan.
4454,It would have been worse but thankfully the vaccine campaign ramped up around the same time and they managed to stop the worst of it.
4455,Seychelles is the world leader in terms of the number of vaccinated people.
4456,"Nevertheless, the number of cases of coronavirus infections is increasing rapidly on the islands."
4457,Do vaccines fail?
4458,Almost 62 percent residents of the country vaccinated with two doses of the vaccine and a total of more than 70 percent.
4459,those after at least one dose.
4460,"With these numbers, Seychelles, an island nation in the Indian Ocean and a popular tourist destination, has become the world leader in vaccination against SARS-CoV-2 ."
4461,"In this respect, they were ahead of three other countries on the list: Israel, Great Britain and the United Arab Emirates."
4462,There are two sources of this success.
4463,"First of all, the Seychelles managed to obtain a Chinese vaccine from Sinopharm and the preparation of AstraZeneca, produced in India under the name Covishield."
4464,"Secondly, the operation was easier to carry out as the population of these paradise islands is less than 99,000."
4465,For comparison: the average daily number of vaccinations against covid-19 in the last seven days in Poland is approx.
4466,300 thousand.
4467,daily.
4468,More than a third of those infected are vaccinated.
4469,"Apparently, however, the Seychelles have fallen victim to its own success."
4470,"&amp;#x200B;

When it turned out that the number of vaccinated people is the fastest in the world, there was a lot of relaxation, the media reported."
4471,"The results did not take long to come about - in May the number of cases of coronavirus infection skyrocketed from several dozen to over 300 cases a day (in total, there were almost 10,000 infections since the beginning of the pandemic, 35 people died, and the current number of infected is over more than 300)."
4472,1.9 thousand).
4473,"&amp;#x200B;

**That is why Seychelles have recently appeared in global news services, especially since - as reported by the local health ministry - as much as 37 percent."
4474,People infected are those who have received two doses of the vaccine.
4475,So what is going on in this tourist paradise?
4476,Has any new vaccine-resistant variant of SARS-CoV-2 emerged?
4477,Or maybe the preparations that were supposed to protect against the coronavirus are not as effective as the data show so far?
4478,The answer to both questions is no.
4479,"** 

**First of all - we do not have complete data on what happened in Seychelles."
4480,"For example, it is not known how many of the people vaccinated with two doses and yet infected with the coronavirus received the Chinese vaccine and how many received AstraZeneka, because there may be some differences in the effectiveness of the two preparations."
4481,"** 

**It is known, however, that in the group of fully vaccinated 57 percent."
4482,"got a Sinopharm preparation, which was administered to residents aged 18 to 60 years, and 43 percent."
4483,"Covishield, which was given to Seychelles over 60 years of age."
4484,"Read also: Brazil questions the quality of Sputnik V, Russians are furious Another question mark: Seychelles authorities have not yet revealed how many days after vaccination infected people caught the infection."
4485,"Perhaps after receiving two injections, they stopped being cautious, even though it takes some time to develop immunity to the coronavirus (in the case of AstraZeneca, 15 days after the second dose)."
4486,"** 

&amp;#x200B;

The age profile of the infected / vaccinated is also unknown, as is which virus variant is widespread on the islands (possibly South African)."
4487,Vaccines effectively protect against severe covid.
4488,"If indeed a lot of people stopped protecting themselves shortly after receiving the second injection, even these 37 percent."
4489,the infected / vaccinated should come as no surprise.
4490,"In addition, AstraZeneca shows (according to the manufacturer's data) 76 percent."
4491,effectiveness in protection against symptomatic covid-19 and 100 percent.
4492,"against severe disease and hospitalization, and Sinopharm protects at the level of 79%."

4506,"Most likely, this is due to the vaccination campaign (almost 60 percent."

4542,Children are facing long hauler symptoms at an alarming rate.
4543,They also have rare but terrible courses with Covid.
4544,"I think we need to take ""the flu"" out of these discussions."
4545,Obviously I have no pediatric patients so I have no professional experience with this.
4546,Which is why experts like Fauci and others use many qualifiers when they make statements.
4547,"Of course, it gets blown up anyway."
4548,"An expert says: ""Well, it's never a bad idea to wash your hands and keep your surfaces clean...""  

Next day's headline: ""EXPERTS SAY HAND-WASHING CURES CORONAVIRUS"""
4549,Excellent post.
4550,Thanks for sharing.
4551,Enjoyed reading it.
4552,They root for anything for blaming someone else because otherwise they might be at fault themselves.

4565,"Lmao, nice job excluding China from the ""civilized world"" with le epic subtle racism"
4566,Hopefully they become freely available soon so I can hop over the border and get my own dose.
4567,Mexico is moving very slow with vaccines.
4568,"I believe if WaPo does have some data, it would share them immediately, which will definitely hits the headline to prove Chinese vax is so sub-optimal."
4569,"I sincerely hope that all who played the ancillary epidemic of undiagnosed and/or untreated issues down, be it physical or mental, looks back and reflects on how dangerous it is to play politics with things that have no place for political opinions or ideology."
4570,"I was one of the many that spoke of it throughout the pandemic wherever and whenever possible, and so so many looked down their nose and sneered at even the mention of it."
4571,Many who tried to go public and were erased from the internet and shunned by some colleagues.
4572,There's still a lot to unpack about the totallity of the effects...
4573,Firstly thanks for taking the time to paste all this information here.
4574,The only thing I would add is that these numbers are far too small to interpret in any meaningful way.
4575,"For example, when you say...

&gt;only two adverse events occurred within the J&amp;J group

...you mean *only* two out of the three women who both received the vaccine and became pregnant, so a 66% chance of adverse effects?"
4576,But these numbers are orders of magnitude too small to determine any kind of causal link here.
4577,What were the minimum ages included in the studies?
4578,"This is my main point, the effects on children haven't been tested yet we're advocating en masse vaccination of children in a very short period of time."
4579,Has more to do with the build up of sediment in reservoirs over the years than the change of rain.
4580,"There has been a lack of agricultural control upstream and huge amounts of erosion have made reservoirs hold much less water, though they look exactly the same from the surface."
4581,Digging them out is incredibly expensive since they are currently being used.
4582,There is also increasing evidence that air pollution is causing lower rainfalls and consumption has steadily been rising over the decades.
4583,Why is this basic message all of the top five replies?
4584,Duh.... that’s the headline and I’m the article.
4585,Why does Reddit think it’s such a huge priority to give the message “we don’t know!
4586,!” Instead of actually discussing the possibilities and information?
4587,[removed]
4588,"Except in this case the ""apple"" is just ""sitting"" around infecting other apples with a novel human coronavirus."
4589,Is this a misleading title or am I reading the article wrong?
4590,"When I read ""post-Covid disease"" this makes me think of PASC but this article seems to be talking about MIS-C not PASC in children."
4591,The rates of MIS-C are smaller than the incidence of PASC in children who have had covid.
4592,"I keep waiting for more info on prevalence, persistence and treatment for PASC in children."
4593,Still waiting I guess.
4594,"It was the same for me last week, in a Hobby Lobby in Texas."
4595,"Nope, not in major metropolitan areas."
4596,[removed]
4597,[removed]
4598,How about comparing Coronavirus to another disease maybe?
4599,"No, but it is very common  at large events like this for a number of people to get sick afterwards due to all the low level illnesses flying around."
4600,I used to run conventions and a lot of our staff would be sick afterwards.
4601,15 people getting sick is nothing.
4602,"If they are vaccinated, chances are close to nil they'll need hospitalization."
4603,This is nothing compared to the usual fall out from large events.
4604,You have to realize though that most adults who aren't vaccinated at this point are probably covid deniers.
4605,That means they won't wear masks and the idea that we're supposed to just rely on the honor system for the unvaccinated to still wear masks is a massive joke.
4606,If we don't check vaccination cards the only thing that's certain is that every unmasked person you see now is potentially someone who is a covid denier.
4607,There is no way to know if someone unmasked is vaccinated or not.
4608,"So it is basically every person for themselves, unfortunately with the children who don't have the option to be vaccinated paying the price of their freedom, since adults can't seem to get it together enough to sacrifice just wearing masks for a little bit longer."
4609,"&gt; unable to work fully

This is a hell of a lot different from “immunocompromised people who can’t receive the vaccine”."
4610,Slight protection should be good enough—the number of people who have died of covid while fully vaxxed  is i mmensely small
4611,"Didn't Texas send everyone back right away anyway because ""science""?"
4612,"The States have been bringing TSMC to NA, though."
4613,This and the alt-right pipeline has pushed more teens to the right than anything.
4614,It seriously fucked with a ton of teens
4615,"However underreported the deaths might be, the deaths per capita of population for India will be lower than US, Brazil and the UK."
4616,Not a victory per se..
4617,"Fortunately the numbers are so low that it really doesn’t seem to be an issue, children included."
4618,"I’m still cautious with my own kids but as someone who literally wears a face mask every day for work and will for the next 30 years, I’m glad to shed mine in public."
4619,I need to see faces.
4620,New England is kicking everyone’s ass.
4621,Two months later 50 % of the studies found no airborn virus DNA.
4622,&gt; No.
4623,It’s exactly the same.
4624,No.
4625,It's exactly different.
4626,2+2=5 just because you say so.
4627,That's far from determined and there is some evidence that vaccines are more protective than having recovered from the illness.
4628,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.04.15.440089v2.full.pdf
4629,I do hope the homeopaths are taking their vaccines 100X diluted.
4630,That seems reasonable.
4631,You or me individually wearing a mask after being vaccinated isn’t going to do anything.
4632,My whole point with this is that we are better off if we still required masks for everyone so that the unvaccinated would keep theirs and all those things that I listed would be more likely to happen.
4633,Tens of millions of unvaccinated people spreading Covid amongst themselves seems like a bad idea for many reasons.
4634,there are a lot of savage behavior hidden behind standards and regulations within so called “civilized” world’s meat production.
4635,Vaccine hesitancy is lower in Europe so maybe they should try it
4636,Good!
4637,"I hope it will become more apparent with time when people are dying and friends and family are asking ""why didn't he/she get vaccinated"" that it's a stupid hill to die on."
4638,Knock me over with a feather.
4639,"Nope, I live in a smaller city outside of Austin."
4640,Most people here have worn masks even during activities where there was little to no threat.
4641,Have seen very very little of the mentality you mention.
4642,I have seen the same thing traveling to the next county over and then when I ventured several counties out to get vaccinated back in February.
4643,This is a publication from a Chinese news agency btw.
4644,It's trying to downplay the lab leak theory and make the Biden administration look guilty of false accusations to which there have been none officially.
4645,Dr. Fauci recently stated he wanted more proof before totally ruling out a lab leak there has not been a formal accusation from the WH since trump.
4646,"Super suspicious ""news"" report, if you ask me."
4647,https://www.globaltimes.cn/about-us/
4648,Will the vaccinations be complete by summer 2022?
4649,Any chance borders will open next year?
4650,"I don't know what would happen to China, but as an Asian living in a predominantly white country I'm pretty sure I can guess what's going to happen to me."

4700,"Should have written:

&gt;Why, for more than a year, was the Chinese government not allowing the WHO in to examine?"
4701,"Well, that's about all I had to say about that."
4702,"On another topic, the lab hypothesis still has so little evidence supporting it that we can still say it's a hypothesis."
4703,"While of course it is hard to pinpoint it's origin, SARS2 RNA is almost 90% identical RNA to that of some bat coronaviruses."
4704,Considering the safety measures in place for any biological lab and considering the safety measures humans have while interacting with wildlife...
4705,I'm not putting my bets on the lab thing.
4706,More so because infected bats are asymptomatic since the virus doesn't really affect them.
4707,"They don't look sick, people don't think that they're sick when handling them."
4708,That's why I bring up that fallacy.
4709,The fact that Wuhan has a lab that researches coronaviruses is not a piece of evidence so it means and adds to the conversation absolutely nothing.
4710,Unless you want to start blaming higher incidence of cancer of people living near telecommunication towers compared to before there were towers and think it's a valid argument.

4748,*
4749,Thanks again for all the information.
4750,The fact you're researching and interpreting all this at your age is commendable.
4751,I'd summarise my thoughts into two main points.
4752,1.
4753,"For you personally, I think the risk of vaccine side effects to be extremely low."
4754,The risks of covid are hopefully very low too but this is another unknown.
4755,"I doubt it matters (medically) directly to you whether you get vaccinated or not, but it might matter to the older people around you and in your community in general."
4756,2.
4757,"My original point was what I feel is a misuse (not by you, but by many) of the term anti-vaxxer."
4758,"By applying this to parents who are wary of giving their children a covid vaccine, we're diluting its meaning."
4759,"We're both misjudging educated people with genuine concerns, while simultaneously downplaying the ignorance of the ""real"" anti-vaxxers."
4760,I've come across this in other areas too.
4761,"It's a bad habit people have of turning everything into ""black and white"" / ""them vs us"" scenarios, and we all know that the world doesn't really work like that."
4762,"For example, if you challenge the developmental stage at which abortion is legal, that doesn't make you a pro-lifer."
4763,The cutoff point is a genuine ethical issue that needs continual discussion and revision.
4764,"Likewise, if you query whether genes from GM organisms could cause problems if transferred into natural ecosystems, that doesn't make you anti-GM,  it's a genuine risk that needs continual monitoring."
4765,If I was your age I'd probably get vaccinated.
4766,"Whether I'm going to vaccinate my four-year-old, who likely has no direct risk from covid and no understanding or ability to give consent, very unlikely any time soon."
4767,If that makes me an anti-vaxxer well then I guess there's suddenly a lot of scientists and doctors joining the club this year...

4917,Both Vaccines do a tremendous job of reducing the chances of either.
4918,AZ is also more efficacious with a longer gap.
4919,PHE expressed the opinion that the data for AZ is likely to improve as time goes on due the timing between doses and the fact that AZ seems to take longer to reach peak effectiveness.

5104,"If vaccination in adults is pushing illness towards the younger population, that’s significant."
5105,"The same link had the list for USA over 100,000."
5106,World wide list is [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_epidemics).
5107,Someone stating that this pandemic is a pandemic does not sound like any information.
5108,"What's ""nice"" about it, exactly?"
5109,"I want the truth no matter what it is, but if it turns out this is from a lab leak I can't say I'll be thinking this is ""nice"" - this isn't a game or something where the people who guess the origin win a prize."

5111,"Wow, that's a good way to market your business."
5112,The link is in Polish but basically it says that the country is going to organise a lottery for vaccinated people.
5113,"The highest prize will be 1,000,000 zł (~$275,000) but there will be many other prices such as lower amounts of cash, cars, scooters, vouchers etc."
5114,"

An allergic reaction is a perfect example of a short term side effect."
5115,"Done with medical supervision, vaccination will be safe."
5116,&gt;Not something I want to mess with.
5117,But you got vaccinated?
5118,Or are you speaking for your child?
5119,Did you really get vaccinated?
5120,What's long term for you?
5121,When is it safe?
5122,Or is this just covering up for not wanting to get the shot?
5123,"There were like three videos of that happening, and China probably was running 10-40x the cases they thought they had and no one knew much about CoVID19."
5124,CoVID19 makes people “happy hypoxics” where they don’t know just how little O2 they are getting.
5125,It also causes clots which can cause a stroke which can cause collapse.
5126,Now that we know about it we are getting to people before this stuff happens.

5131,How do we know the long term effects of getting a COVID infection?
5132,"It's a risk-benefit between getting vaccinated and being infected by COVID, and by all indication with tens of millions of people in either group it's far safer to get vaccinated."
5133,The future is uncertain but I don't know why anyone would choose the COVID virus over a vaccine.
5134,I never said it's not possible for it to be natural.
5135,I'm just saying the writing is on the wall.
5136,You have some significant minority who believes that COVID is either a hoax or no worse than the flu.
5137,"They may understand they can spread it, but don't care."
5138,"If you think a virus like this cannot possibly be natural, you really need to take a class on viruses lol."
5139,It could have been far worse.
5140,"Judging by the behaviour of the people near me, this news will help it jump back up."
5141,"The minute we had news of lowering cases, one could see crowds (huge crowds) flocking malls, movie theaters, beaches and restaurants."
5142,With extremely ill fitting masks and no regards to social distancing.
5143,I have no hope.

5150,Is the vaccination rate slowing down?
5151,"I recall doing some quick maffs in April and I was convinced we should have around 60% at least one dose by 2nd week may but looking at the data, it's only at 49.9%."
5152,Are we not administering more than 3 million doses now?
5153,What are you suggesting?
5154,"&gt; Maybe you don’t realize that Covid triage has been well discussed all over the world, for over a year now."
5155,"Yea, and every time it hits the general press in the United States special interest groups come out of the woodwork, politicians grandstand and then everyone outside of the medical field quickly puts their heads back into the sand."
5156,If you go back to my original comment you will see that it was general in nature.
5157,And it is a general discussion that is badly needed in the United States.
5158,Odds are the trio will speak about this during the press conference this afternoon.
5159,"If Aaron Derfel found out, then it must have been close to being announced anyway."
5160,"Yeah, there's no signs of covid changing so much that immunity doesn't work anymore."
5161,It may even be a scientific impossibility that it changes to escape immunity.
5162,I was thinking the same thing
5163,"&gt;""Adults who delay getting vaccinated present a risk to those who have not been vaccinated and to those who have been vaccinated but have a compromised immune system, like the elderly,"" Peacock said."
5164,"""Those are reasons why we are aiming for 70% of the population being vaccinated because we need that level of immunity to protect the whole population."""
5165,"This may be the biggest ""no shit, sherlock"" article I've seen recently."
5166,How is this even news?
5167,Literally everyone knows that unvaccinated people can spread COVID-19.
5168,At least Western WA is mostly picking up the slack.
5169,"As of yesterday, in King County, 60.3% of 16+ are fully vaccinated and 72.7% have received their first dose."
5170,"Get it, hon!!!"
5171,"(What they didn't tell the rest of the country was that Hogan put Old Bay in all the doses, pretty much guaranteeing that all of us Marylanders HAVE to take it.)"
5172,I'm actually surprised people have been investing in relationships.
5173,Was just the opposite for me since I couldn't get together with them.
5174,Have lost some friends that weren't as close because of it.
5175,"And yeah, I played games though some with my friends so that actually did keep up friendships."
5176,Fair.
5177,But most of people don't have choice.
5178,"If it's the only thing they can get, then it's a net positive."
5179,"Also it has 90% protection against hospitalization and 100% against death, so it's good enough."
5180,Exactly my thinking.
5181,Hoping we hear more about it soon.
5182,Absolutely.
5183,This is why we’ve been vaccinated.
5184,"But until we have long term data, I just don’t agree that we can guarantee."
5185,Just like my child’s doctor told us she cannot tell us what will happen when she gets her covid vaccine since she’s had a vaccine allergic reaction in the past.
5186,We just don’t have that data yet.
5187,"But you are right, we have longer term covid data."

5197,Canada is doing a 16 week interval to get more people having one shot.
5198,That's why our percentage of fully vaccinated is so low.
5199,[removed]
5200,I just hope they get some sort of definitive answer at some point.
5201,All of this speculation is pointless and is mostly based on our own biases more than anything.
5202,All of my friends who dislike China for one reason or another?
5203,They have lab leak theories.
5204,Everyone I know who tries to be more supportive of China?
5205,It could literally never be from a lab!
5206,I think at this point we should all accept our own plausible explanations are the same nonsense as everyone else's plausible explanation until an investigation turns up something definitive.
5207,"from CBS weijia jiang(16 hours ago)

quotes from Fauci-----NEW: Dr. Fauci tells me that **his opinion about the origins of COVID-19 have not changed: He believes that it is “highly likely” that it first occurred naturally before spreading from animal to human."
5208,"Since no one is 100% sure, he’s open to a thorough investigation..............Dr. Fauci said that does not mean he believes the virus first emerged in a lab, as some have suggested.He does not know anything about the three researchers at the Wuhan lab who sought hospital care in November 2019 as reported by the WSJ."

5210,"15 cases, wow."
5211,"Good news, it shows that the UK's vaccination program works and that, in general, vaccines work."
5212,I think the point is that the OP complains to the media about a reaction the readers have.
5213,It's not the fault of journalism that people freak out over accurately reported facts.
5214,"&gt;the academically honest one is simply “nobody knows if we’ll need a booster”

Then why ask the question in the first place if you're not going to reflect the answer?"
5215,"It's the job of journalists to report facts, not what they think people will want to hear."
5216,So you're not basing this off statistics from myocarditis in coronavirus or the coronavirus vaccine
5217,4 to 6 weeks ago those barriers were still very much in place.
5218,"Considering that it takes 3 weeks to get both shots, and then an additional few weeks for the second shot to take full effect so that you count as “fully vaccinated” there is obviously going to be some lag time as each new group is given the vaccine."
5219,This is not rocket science.
5220,"https://www.census.gov/library/stories/2021/04/how-do-covid-19-vaccination-and-vaccine-hesitancy-rates-vary-over-time.html

And buy whatever theory you want to; the numbers back this up, as shown in the very article we are commenting on."
5221,"Hell, according to polls, the younger crowds aren’t even the most hesitant to get the vaccine."
5222,The 25-40 age group is most hesitant.
5223,Both things can be true.
5224,"It’s better than no vaccine, but it also sucks compared to Pfizer/Moderna/J&amp;J etc in terms of efficacy."
5225,"For me, it just felt like a moderate hangover."
5226,Tired/groggy and a bit feverish.
5227,Nothing terrible.
5228,The link is in Polish but basically it says that the country is going to organise a lottery for vaccinated people.

5231,Post gonna get downvoted i think
5232,"&gt;Those who delay getting a COVID-19 vaccine should understand that they can pose a risk to those who haven't been vaccinated yet including children under 12 years of age, a Health Department of Northwest Michigan official said."
5233,"&gt;Lisa Peacock, the department's health officer, said unvaccinated adults could potentially spread the disease."
5234,"&gt;""Adults who delay getting vaccinated present a risk to those who have not been vaccinated and to those who have been vaccinated but have a compromised immune system, like the elderly,"" Peacock said."
5235,"""**Those are reasons why we are aiming for 70% of the population being vaccinated because we need that level of immunity to protect the whole population**."""
5236,"yah just kidding, i don't think any scientists are actually overly concerned with variants right now."
5237,3.4 isn't 4.
5238,The reality is that the virus will be worse than the vaccine.
5239,"In the history of vaccines (in the US, that were approved at all), we basically don't see any side effects that do show up after 6 months but that didn't also show up within 2 months."
5240,"It's been 2 months for tons of people, so we can be pretty sure that there won't be any."
5241,"There are clearly side effects, but not long term ones."
5242,Preprint articles require a higher degree of scrutiny and rigor to accurately evaluate than many other types of articles.

5262,"Great data, but for me it raises more questions than it answers."
5263,So far it appears that most fully vaccinated spreaders were symptomatic.
5264,"The vaccine certainly doesn't prevent transmission to a great extend, if we only consider this data."
5265,It looks like fully vaccinated case 63160 is even a super-spreader.
5266,"Very hard to draw any conclusions from this data, there are so many factors such as testing strategy, occupation status, symptom status etc."
5267,Still quite interesting.
5268,There's just no way for a virus to spread like it did without being airborne though.
5269,It never made any sense that aerosols weren't involved.
5270,And the experts I was listening to in February/March (and had posted about it in mid January) were always of the opinion that it was airborne.
5271,It's really unfortunate how long it took for the CDC and WHO to acknowledge basic facts.

Caution is good, but you do need to remember that the risk to an unvaccinated 20something is extremely low, especially a combined with the 'herd immunity' from high vaccination rates reducing the actual prevalence of covid in circulation."
5313,The vaccines bring mid-70s case fatality rate from about 1 in 100 to closer to 1 in 10000.

5732,"Yeah, they're put at risk, but weren't kids used as reasons to push adults (teachers) back to in-person teaching and putting them at risk?"
5733,"Kids supposedly were low-risk vectors so, because of that, teachers should go back to teaching (when they may have been high risk for severe COVID)."
5734,"I feel like kids have become pawns to whatever emotional argument is in vogue at the time, and I think people are reacting to the ""save the children"" mantra when it's been used from both sides."

5789,"Because people think that the entire world needs to open up fully again now that \~40% of the US is fully vaccinated, and they're too thick to think of a reason why we can't do that yet."
5790,So they need articles like this to remind them.
5791,Lol or it’s been around much longer than we thought but nobody attributed illness and death to it bc they had no idea.
5792,Like the people dying of covid aren’t dying from just covid itself.
5793,"It's doubtful AZ, Moderna, and J&amp;J will meet their deadlines."

Anti vaxxers try to frame this as a difference of opinion because it does several things."
5882,1) it puts someones whackadoo opinion with no backing evidence on the same playing field as a team of scientists' decades of work to find supporting evidence for their claims.
5883,"2) it shifts the battle from evaluating two claims only on their merits  to evaluating whether one side is  unfairly being stifled by the other side and not being allowed to have an opinion, which is frankly just an easier bad faith argument to win."
5884,"If you fought anti vax propaganda on just its merits it would lose, easily, everytime."
5885,Vaccination efficacy is not an opinion.
5886,It is science backed by tons of peer reviewed research across countries.
5887,The evidence is freely and readily available to anyone who bothers to look.
5888,The methods used have been vetted by other professionals in the field across multiple countries.
5889,Anyone is free to refute this provided they have research to back their claims.
5890,This belief that somehow vaccine efficacy is just one opinion out of many is... just wrong.
5891,"Science isn't an opinion, it's either backed by research or disproven by research."
5892,It's iterative and builds on itself.
5893,It's fine to say science right now doesn't have a 100% complete picture of how vaccines affect everyone and even to worry about the fact there might be some side effect that isn't fully known.
5894,But your concerns shouldn't govern policy and shouldn't carry the same weight as the research done to show that vaccines are largely effective and safe UNLESS you provide compelling research to show otherwise.
5895,Your free to have the opinion that you are the best and safest driver in the world while inebriated.

5943,They are sitting on a huge stockpile of Pfizer from the EU and also other vaccines.
5944,They just authorized Moderna and AZ last Friday so they have tons of supply.
5945,"All they need to do is inject it, which is super frustrating since they aren’t using pharmacies and they just authorized dentists to inject vaccines."
5946,Where did you get that from my comment?
5947,"Is it this: ""A lot of people pushed for it not for the kids' educational benefit, but to get the national economy back in gear."""
5948,?
5949,I'll stand by that.
5950,"Yes, there is educational benefit to children, especially economically or educationally at risk children."
5951,A lot of areas were not and are not able to implement remote learning.
5952,"Yes, a lot of people put forth arguments for in person learning in good faith."
5953,"However, a whole lot of politicians who have actively worked against funding schools, adequately paying teachers, removing lead from schools and feeding hungry children so they can learn suddenly came out yelling about how important it is to get kids back in school *for the kids* when it became clear that having kids out of school was pulling adults out of work and impacting the economy."
5954,"So...yes, I do think those people were arguing in bad faith and gave zero shits about education and the well-being of children, before and during covid."
5955,"*Those* are the people who are treating teachers like glorified babysitters, not me."
5956,Oh.
5957,"Ah, but with littles,  a trip to the zoo also includes riding the train, feeding the giraffes, going into the manatee house, and doing indoor spaces, where there are certain to be crowds."
5958,Otherwise there are meltdowns.
5959,"And we live in an area where a high % of folks ""don't believe"" in COVID or ""identify as vaccinated"" so they can go maskless."
5960,We happily did the zoo last summer when everyone was masked and they limited crowds.
5961,I have 0% confidence that the maskeless folks in crowds at the zoo are vaccinated.
5962,"Even  if my kids are masked, I don't trust being in large crowds with everyone unmasked, when I know we've had folks locally who have decided that they don't have to isolate if they have COVID or quarantine if they are exposed."
5963,"We've taken such pains to keep the kids safe this long, I'm not going to take that risk just for a trip to the zoo."
5964,Same for them having birthday parties this year.
5965,"They both have summer birthdays, no parties last year."
5966,"This year they will get a ""just family"" party with just us and the grandparents who are all vaxxed."
5967,"But no other kids because parents ""won't make their kids wear a mask if the government says they don't have to."""

5973,70% is an educated estimate based on actual data.
5974,It’s not a guess.
5975,"There are viruses with similar or higher rates of infection that we’ve reached herd immunity for, like Measles."
5976,70% is the lower end of the scale and I’ve yet to see anyone propose 60% is anywhere close to reaching herd immunity.
5977,Most experts say 80-90% and again that’s based on past viruses with similar or even worse infection rates.
5978,"Regardless, my entire point from my OC is that 70% of adults is not 70% of the population."
5979,It’s far less.
5980,"Demand has been dropping for the vaccine, our vaccination rates aren’t rising fast enough for what people want for herd immunity."
5981,This is why most epidemiologist say Covid will circulate in a similar fashion to the flu.
5982,"Not good if you catch it, but it won’t cripple society like it did in 2020."
5983,"And not for nothing, but there are a lot of parents who got vaccinated themselves that won’t take their kids to get the Covid vaccine."
5984,These are people who saw the vaccine as “a risk” that they’re were willing to take as an adult but won’t impose on their children.

5996,*
5997,No shit
5998,Cuba exports doctors.
5999,Jesus don't get me started on this secessionist BS
6000,"I don't know whether it's harder for us or parents of kids who are old enough to know what they are missing out on, but not old enough to be in zoom classes."
6001,"Or not old enough to entertain themselves for a good chunk of the day, like u/cincinnati_MPH, props to you because 4 and 6 has to be TOUGH."
6002,"For us, my little guy was born this fall, he doesn't know what he's missing."
6003,But at the same time he needs constant attention.
6004,"And, when they are too little for a mask themselves...there's no other mitigation for parents to rely on besides staying home."
6005,"It does feel like there's hope, and I actually feel OK with outdoor stuff (I live in CT, most people here are vaccinated) so we'll see what this summer is like."
6006,"But to your point, I think parents were kind of just pushed aside with no acknowledgment by the CDC in that announcement."
6007,"A lot of people only get tested if they know/suspect they were exposed, and as overall cases decrease, the number of exposed people also decreases."
6008,It’s so blatantly obvious the COVID was developed in a lab.
6009,Too many coincidences.
6010,China has probably already killed anyone who knows the truth and destroyed all of the evidence.
6011,It's infuriating.
6012,Reposting something that I had written a couple of weeks ago regarding biological plausibility of a mRNA vaccine altering your DNA.
6013,\- A mRNA vaccine is incapable of changing your DNA.
6014,That is impossible for three reasons.
6015,DNA in a cell is housed in the nucleus.
6016,In order to access the nucleus the vaccine would need to pass though the nuclear membrane.
6017,"To do that, the vaccine would need a nuclear access signal (which it doesn't have)."
6018,No signal means that it is biologically impossible for the vaccine to enter your nucleus and interact with your DNA.
6019,DNA and RNA are separate languages.
6020,Let's suppose that the vaccine somehow did the biologically impossible and managed to sneak though a nuclear membrane.
6021,In that situation the RNA from the vaccine would be incapable of communicating with the DNA of your cell.
6022,RNA and DNA are completely different languages.
6023,"For DNA and RNA to communicate with each other a ""translator"" reverse transcription enzyme would need to be used."
6024,The vaccine does not have this enzyme in it and therefore it is impossible for vaccine RNA to communicate with cellular DNA.
6025,RNA cannot integrate with DNA without integrase.
6026,"If biological impossibility 1 and 2 happened, the vaccine RNA would still be incapable of integrating with your DNA."
6027,"For this to happen, yet another enzyme would need to be present in the vaccine."
6028,Which it is not.
6029,"Has there been any news about this age range, yet?"
6030,"I assume there is some amount of testing going on, but I haven't heard anything."
6031,military is a sworn oath to your country and superiors.
6032,This is really starting to piss me off.
6033,Canada is **looking** for reasons to keep restrictions while the rest of the vaccinated world is moving on.
6034,Also we are using mostly Pfizer.
6035,What the hell does some remote island using Sinopharm have to do with anything?
6036,You shouldn't have to be desperate to order and create a plan for administering a life saving vaccine program.
6037,Great explanation thank you.
6038,"And yes you're right about Pfizer, I was googling around before I asked the question."
6039,"And it's the ""Why does approval usually take years for vaccines when they approved this one in only a few months""."
6040,- This is the main point of everyone I've talked to.
6041,"It's never a political thing, mostly a ""I don't trust something so quick when it's not even fda approved""."
6042,-_-
6043,"In Germany, he would already face charges for being in uniform at a rally: [""The soldier must not wear uniform at political events."
6044,"""](https://www.buzer.de/gesetz/2246/a31651.htm) Is there a similar law in Canada?"
6045,"To add to your edit, my high schooler got more exercise moving from class to class, than getting from home to school."
6046,"Then there’s gym class, drama class, art class, none of which involve sitting at a desk."
6047,"Then in other classes like science they were often outside doing experiments on the sports fields, down at the creek, etc."
6048,"Social science they would be on walking trips, etc."
6049,Maybe our school board is just different?
6050,"I had no problem with vaccinated people waiting when we had supply constraints for the vaccine, but we have such a surplus now that we could have already achieved herd immunity even without the 12 &amp; under being eligible if enough people were willing to get vaccinated."
6051,"With demand dropping for the vaccines, it’s becoming more unreasonable to ask vaccinated people, who aren’t the ones spreading the virus or getting sick, to keep waiting...for something?"
6052,"I use to see wear mask forever as a straw man, but lately I’ve been waning on that."
6053,It’s getting harder to find approximations from people who support mask on when they think we should take them off.
6054,"In terms of herd immunity, well, there will always be Covid circulating among unvaccinated people, but the vast majority of those people can go get a shot today if they want."
6055,I’ve seen people argue that the US shouldn’t reopen because Covid is currently bad in *India*.
6056,"Basically, I think people have a hard time understand that within this country, we’ve already done the bulk of the work and things are just about as good as they are going to get."
6057,I don’t see any point in waiting until 2022 for a “fresh start” as some people have suggested since due to the seasonality of the virus January of 2022 is probably going to be worse than June of 2021.
6058,"Even the unvaccinated are doing pretty good during the summer, but they don’t fare well during the winter."
6059,Yet some people are really against removing mask during the summer when it’s safe and insist on waiting a quantifiable length of time as if it will actually have a meaningful impact at this point.
6060,Only about 20 percent are refusing the vaccine per the most recent polling.
6061,"The trials relevant to US approval, and Canadian approval, are in the US."
6062,In this case they won't be using international studies for approval.
6063,"&gt; Vaccinated people basically can't spread the virus to anyone else, so they don't think they should have to wear a mask anymore."
6064,This is the boat I'm in.
6065,"I would be on this side as well, but it's impractical since many governments are just completely dropping the mask mandate altogether, and bad faith actors who aren't vaccinated will not follow CDC guidelines to wear a mask to protect other unvaccinated people."
6066,"Perhaps if we had vaccine passports and some authorities to enforce mask mandates on the unvaccinated it would work, but right now it seems like there's no good way to protect those that can't be vaccinated from those that refuse to be vaccinated."
6067,"When I'm at work or at home and have other vaccinated people over, I don't worry about COVID at all despite having unvaccinated children."
6068,It's just not realistic.
6069,"However, that also means that I won't let my kids stop wearing masks out in public, and we're still limiting a lot of their public interactions as a result of COVID (which is still going around among children in my area as the majority of adults in my county are fully vaccinated and a higher number have at least one dose.)"
6070,I'm both optimistic that we're near the end of this whole thing as a society and pessimistic that it's being drawn out because of people who refuse to cooperate in a way that would be beneficial to society.
6071,“but kids are low risk!1”
6072,Please.
6073,"Maybe true for NZ but Australia is just as wealthy as Canada, a country which also has no vaccine manufacturing capacity and is currently at over 50% vaccinated with a first dose."
6074,"Australia has no excuse, they just fumbled the vaccine plan."
6075,But being an obstinate arsehole is not a psychiatric diagnosis.
6076,Nothing here suggest the need for enforced psychiatric observation - though I suspect Singapore uses it as a form of social control in addition to anything medical
6077,"&gt; A pretty clear line is pre-pubescent and post-pubescent, hence this 12-year-old cutoff

Further dumb question, does this mean if a child is an early or late bloomer RE: puberty they'd need a different type (assuming changes are made) of a vaccine, or be ineligible for their age group?"
6078,E.g.
6079,"if they were 12, but not through puberty, could they still take an approved vaccine for 12-17 year-olds?"
6080,I lived in DC up until a few days ago for college and honestly it was stunning to me how well it was run.
6081,Everyone who pre-registered got an appointment soon after they were eligible.
6082,"Soon after the whole pop was eligible, you’d check out buying a soda at a CVS and they’d ask you if you’ve been vaccinated yet and offer one then and there."
6083,Finding the intermediate host animal is crucial because humans don’t handle this bat at all naturally.
6084,They don’t really eat it and Yunnan is a very remote and rural province.
6085,One of the few reasons this particular bat was handled by people at all was to in fact research Coronaviruses.
6086,"""Bắc Giang Province, the hotspot of the latest COVID-19 outbreak, has detected 375 new community cases, the highest daily increase of the fourth wave."
6087,"In total on Tuesday, the Ministry of Health registered 447 new infections nationwide, the biggest increase since the pandemic began."
6088,"Of those, three are imported cases and the remaining are 28 from Bắc Ninh Province, 23 from Hà Nội, seven from Lạng Sơn City, five from Hà Nam Province, two from Đà Nẵng City, and one from Thái Bình, Điện Biên, the Cancer Hospital (K) Hospital and HCM City respectively."
6089,All cases in Hà Nội are related to the confirmed positive case from Spica Company and Đình Trám Industrial Zone in Bắc Giang Province.
6090,They had been quarantined previously.
6091,"All cases in Bắc Giang Province are from the Quang Châu, Vân Trung, and Song Khê-Nội Hoàng industrial zones."
6092,"Speaking at an urgent virtual meeting on Tuesday, Minister of Health Nguyễn Thanh Long said the new strain of SARS-CoV-2 virus and the high density of workers in the industrial zones sharing bathrooms and canteens led to the record number."
6093,"From Bắc Giang Province, Deputy Minister of Health Nguyễn Trường Sơn said the number of new cases would certainly rise in the coming days."
6094,"Lê Ánh Dương, Chairman of Bắc Giang People's Committee reported more than 12,600 people had been in close contact with the confirmed positive cases and needed to be quarantined."
6095,"In the past three days, the province has focused on large-scale testing."
6096,"Notably, the ratio of F1 negative to positive was very high."
6097,"At Shin Young Company, the first firm in Vân Trung industrial park to detect infection cases, the rate of patients from negative to positive was 79 per cent."
6098,This rate at Hosiden Company in Quang Châu industrial zone was 55 per cent.
6099,"There were 18 cases of community transmissions in residential areas, but all were related to infected workers."
6100,Three more cases of medical staff on duty were reported.
6101,"Dương said the province had prepared a capacity of 2,627 hospital beds and a field hospital with the capacity of 620 beds located at the provincial gymnasium."
6102,"At the meeting, Long asked the ministry’s special department in Bắc Giang Province to develop a scenario in case there are more than 3,000 new cases and to actively respond to the situation."
6103,"“The priority is to stamp out the pandemic in Bắc Giang Province so that it will not spread to neighbouring provinces and cities,” he said."
6104,"“The urgent tasks that need to be implemented right now are to re-evaluate all risks of all districts, not only the four isolated districts under the Government’s Directive 16, and apply social distancing if needed.”   
  
Areas where workers are living such as My Điền and Núi Hiểu villages must be locked down."
6105,Quick testing must be conducted for all residents in the surrounding areas every three days and PCR testing every week.
6106,Testing points must be set up to collect and return results to local people instead of sending samples to the authorised agencies and centres.
6107,"The provincial CDC reported more than 50,000 people in the high-risk group that had still not been tested."
6108,Long said these people needed to get quick testing on the spot instead of waiting for PCR testing.
6109,Those who were negative to the virus must be quarantined and wait for PCR testing after seven days.

6188,Previous erosion of privacy is never a good justification for further erosion and plenty of people do in fact take steps to preserve their own privacy.

6190,"&gt;&gt; However, framing things as if we could see something comparable the three big surges we have seen in the US over the past 14 months is extremely pessimistic."
6191,That's not even what the article said.
6192,It just said that we'll probably see local spikes in places with low vaccination rates.
6193,There's still the very real question of how long natural immunity protects an individual especially in regards to variants.
6194,The article offers that the simple solution is to get as many people vaccinated so that we won't have to worry about problems these spikes might entail.

6216,The office refuses to get vaccinated and the other 1/2 are fully vaccinated- going to be fun if we ever have to go back on

6222,My partners uncle was the same way; albeit he's a bit younger.
6223,He was just released from the hospital after battling with COVID since February; part of his hospital time included 40ish days in a medically induced coma.
6224,"Now he's in an assisted living facility, trying to regain the strength to walk again, all while being tethered by a 50 foot O2 hose."
6225,But at least he didn't have to wear a mask.

6231,Do we even know what the herd immunity threshold is?
6232,The estimates I've seen vary by over 10%.
6233,At this point all we can do is strongly encourage people to get the vaccine for FREE.
6234,Eventually we'll see transmission drop to very low levels in states that are highly vaccinated and get a better estimate for what the herd immunity threshold is.
6235,They are working backwards validating that the doses are both effective and well-tolerated.
6236,In 12-17 they used the same dose as for adults; they'll be trying smaller doses on 5-11 and then picking a dose for 2-5 based on what they observe in 5-11.
6237,How many people have died?
6238,It's ok so far?
6239,We have very different definitions of ok.
6240,Yea most of the college kids I know who don’t want the vaccine have already gotten covid because they never cared in the first place
6241,"I feel like it'll happen suddenly, just like a lot of things on both sides of the border have been."
6242,They have almost four weeks before they need to announce *something* for June 21st.

6245,"I read that EMA is evaluating Pfizer vaccine above 12 year, and they are expecting a decision in June."
6246,So is it expected that they will approve it?
6247,I need the vaccine cause I dont want covid and I need vaccine certificate to see movies 😆.
6248,Thanks
6249,Lol I’ve lived here 30 years and I can tell you it has never been close to as bad as it has been the last 5-8 years

Hah!"
6325,"I joined the Air Cadets when I was a kid because my friend told me I could fly a plane after the first year, after you get your wings badge or whatever."
6326,I immediately took a disliking to the cadet leader.
6327,"He was a pompous, arrogant twat who clearly thought he was in the military."
6328,My dad was in the forces and I grew up in the forces around forces people so to me he was just a big old pretender.
6329,"After a year, he refused to give me my wings - essentially making the entire reason I was there pointless and wasting a year putting up with his bullshit."
6330,Called him a massive twat in the middle of drills and walked out - satisfying.
6331,Found out 10 years later he was arrested for scamming old folks.
6332,My bullshitter radar was on point.
6333,Which is why the CDC changing their guidance on masks at this point was truly mind boggling.
6334,There have been a lot of “no shit Sherlock” articles lately.
6335,It seems outlets are scraping the bottom of the barrel with content and are just bringing out headlines from this time last year and adding “unvaccinated” to it
6336,"If a mild case provides lifetime antibodies, and it’s unknown if vaccines do, then what’s the purpose of vaccine passports?"
6337,&gt; Odd how they never worried about the long term complications of vehicle related injuries before all this started.
6338,Parents have always worried about this.
6339,"It's why we're so strict with children car seats, seat belts, etc."
6340,"Ok, so can I reasonably infer from that that you believe in the strategy of ""zero covid""?"
6341,I.e.
6342,"that any amount of infection from coronavirus is unacceptable, and that all non essential activity should stop if there is even a single covid case?"
6343,"Because the way I see it, that view is not one which is compatible with allowing vaccinated people to mingle freely."
6344,"If you allow vaccinated people to mingle freely, some of them will still spread the virus."
6345,China is so fucking strict right now.
6346,"A sportsteam had to quarantine for 4 weeks after returning home, no chance of getting out earlier when testing negative."
6347,And I believe every other person has to do that too.
6348,I can't image how the could be letting the virus back in.

6350,He’s Canadian.
6351,"This is really, really different."
6352,"He’s not in the Army Reserve, he wakes up kids at summer camp, yells at them and makes them run around."
6353,"One key difference is that the [legislation enabling the FDA to issue emergency use authorizations](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/21/360bbb-3) includes a notification provision to recipients that the product does not have full approval:

&gt; (ii) Appropriate conditions designed to ensure that individuals to whom the product is administered are informed—

&gt;   (I) that the Secretary has authorized the emergency use of the product;

&gt;   (II) of the significant known and potential benefits and risks of such use, and of the extent to which such benefits and risks are unknown; and

&gt;   (III) of the option to accept or refuse administration of the product, of the consequences, if any, of refusing administration of the product, and of the alternatives to the product that are available and of their benefits and risks."
6354,I think that implies that a gentle touch should be used when working with the vaccine hesitant.
6355,"Children under 12 haven’t had the chance to be vaccinated yet, and vaccinations for people 12 to 15 have only just started."
6356,Meanwhile 50% of the total US population is at least partially vaccinated and we’re adding 1.7 million new vaccinations per day.

6428,"So it’s not out of staters inflating the CDC numbers, it’s instaters going out that are deflating the State department numbers."

6479,"When you get a job in hospitals in the US, they ask for your measles, mumps, rubella, and varicella titers."

6495,"I get your point of view, I just think that the current numbers being presented in the population, makes restricting kids from school and in person learning more unethical."
6496,One thing I think is worth mentioning is that those that have only had the vaccine do not have superior immunity to those that had the virus before the vaccine.
6497,Vaccinated convalescent sera after one MRNA shot is far superior to two shot MRNA sera.
6498,And no variant could break through for severe illness due to N antibodies.

6526,"Because, they are."
6527,Check the polling data.
6528,That's again comparing an 80-year risk versus an annual (to date) risk.
6529,There are 2x as many Covid breakthrough deaths so far as there are lightning deaths per year (49).
6530,"&gt; it flies you into no name airports an hour outside of whatever city you’re going to

No, it doesn't."
6531,Ryanair flies to plenty of normal airports too.
6532,If someone bought a flight to Dusseldorf Weeze or Milan Bergamo without checking where these airports are actually located - decades after budget airlines and their practices are well publicized - then that's on them.
6533,"It's a flying bus and perfectly fine for short jaunts around Europe at great prices, I've spent more getting to/from the airport (Stansted/Gatwick which are actually more convenient than Heathrow from East London) than to France/Poland/Italy."

6539,"Personally, based on the science and statistics I've see, it's not that deadly."
6540,"If I had kids, I would let them have a little more freedom and have better social development."
6541,"Again, that's based on my own personal risk assessment."
6542,Reddit and not Instagram or whatever really does have the most basic bitches.

6567,I know a bunch of people who got J&amp;J when given the choice.
6568,"Mostly young people who hear ""one dose"" aren't that worried about covid, and can travel and unmask after 2 weeks."
6569,I'm really glad it's an option.

6571,Haha!
6572,"I didn't downvote the comments, but just to point out."
6573,EUA is not in this case a benchmark for safety as much as for efficacy.
6574,I don't think FDA would ever grant EUA for the 12-15 with uncertainties of safety and way low risk in that age group for Covid-19.
6575,"However, we are not sure what the efficacy will be in long-term for these vaccines."
6576,Do they last 6 months?
6577,9 without major issues?
6578,12?
6579,"It isn't an ideal situation but since we don't have a time machine *and* we're in the mid of a pandemic, 6 months granted efficacy, but probably more, is more than enough."
6580,Waiting full approval is not the wisest choice because EUA already grants the benefits outweigh the risk.
6581,Why use an emergency authorized drug/vaccine?
6582,Because we're *in one* (pandemic is a health emergency)

6594,"If she had just gotten rid of the rule first, no problem."
6595,Some places here in Seattle are vaccinating almost 12-year-olds.
6596,I am tempted to do it so they don't have to mask all summer.
6597,"I went in a store today for the second time without a mask, I was the only one without one and got a ton of dirty looks."

6615,by asking them how the mRNA or even the J&amp;J vaccine work.

6618,"But, not surprised, most people don't even know how their credit score works or how to read their closing disclosure when buying a house (you know, MAJOR life things but people spend no time understanding)."

6632,I am grateful for people who sign their babies up for vaccine studies.
6633,The study that indicated a high attack rate was *incredibly* flawed and certainly overestimated prior infections by a wide margin.
6634,One thing I've been wondering regarding these different timelines for child vaccinations: How are families planning their summer activities on these varying timelines?
6635,Are families who are being serious about steering clear of COVID just waiting until everyone in the house is fully vaxed (which could mean a long time if the youngest child is under the cutoff)?
6636,Maybe a compromise this summer &amp; keeping to only outdoor activities?

6782,Everyone 16+ can get vaccinated in every single state and in many states 12+ can get vaccinated.
6783,I don’t buy this theory.
6784,"You can walk into a mass vaccination site, a grocery store, a large retailer etc and get a vaccine, there’s really no barriers whatsoever anymore."
6785,I 100% understand that all provinces are going for a first dose strategy.
6786,But many of the people who crossed the border last time went for second doses.
6787,So it's not a pointless idea for people to go all the way down to get an early second dose for the extra protection and peace of mind they may get from it.
6788,"What happened if you don't mind sharing 

Did you you feel anything from the first shot?"
6789,It’s unfortunate that people prioritize their tastebuds over a creature’s entire existence.

6795,They've subscribed to the flavor of the chips not just being used for tracking but also for being able to allow for mind control...I really wish I were kidding...
6796,"At this point, the deep south and a few states in the Rockies are so comparatively low that *most* states are outpacing the nation as a whole."
6797,Depends on the country.
6798,If it’s the US (given that this is the Post) then the time to discuss this was December when vaccines was approved.
6799,It’s basically over now here unless you’re a big time goober

6815,I think different companies will have a variety of strategies.
6816,"My company has required us to be at the office for months, vaccine or no vaccine."
6817,Masks are still only required when you're not at your desk.
6818,So their strategy is no strategy.
6819,My husband's company has told anyone who can't be vaccinated that they can work from home indefinitely.
6820,"For those who can get vaccinated, they have an incentive program instead now that they're back at the office 3 days a week."
6821,"Once you fill out the form online, you get a gift card, extra vacation time and you can take off your mask."
6822,That form not filled out?
6823,Your manager will repeatedly remind you to put your mask back on.
6824,"I think that strategy is pretty genius, tbh."
6825,"They're protecting the people who can't be vaccinated, they're rewarding those who get it and subtly punishing people who refuse."
6826,And it's all voluntary.
6827,No one is required to share their vaccine status on that form.
6828,The form is just what gets you out of your mask purgatory.
6829,"Yeah

Mine did have a weird streak on some things but he could also use a back x-ray to tell someone exactly where bad posture was messing them up and also heavily preached against things that can actually cause long term damage like making kids lug overweight backpacks around the halls"
6830,"Lol, I didn’t make any conclusions."
6831,I literally said there isn’t a scientific consensus in one direction or another.
6832,Fauci is no longer saying the evidence points strongly in the direction of a natural jump.
6833,"That you aren’t able to acknowledge that change after him previously saying the evidence was very, very strong makes it obvious you have some weird agenda here."
6834,It’s clear you are here to be right and make others wrong.
6835,Oh no we need to lockdown the UK again and ban all international travel
6836,The 5G chips stopped working so they didn't report in.

6838,"I know, but I'm saying they should have thrown 11 year olds into that first group to allow a population of kids to become eligible earlier."
6839,"(Sorry, I'm an impatient parent of a high risk 11 year old.)"
6840,Only have 5 days worth of data so may be a  numbers will likely fluctuate over the next two days due to that and not the actual uptake rate.
6841,I used estimates from the CDC including population numbers that are close to 10 years old and about 5 percent low.
6842,So for the most part each percent estimate is about 4-5 percent higher than it should be but for sake of consistency I will stick with the 2010 census estimate the CDC uses.
6843,"5.217 million NJ residents with 1st dose - 58.7%

(5.199 million - 58.5% yesterday)

5.033 million 18+ with 1st dose - 72.5%

(5.020 million - 72.3% yesterday)

89.4% of 65+ have first dose (89.3% yesterday)

At this rate, the first dose shots will reach these percentages on these dates."
6844,"Total Population Numbers(58.7% Now)

60% - 5/30 (5/29 yesterday)

65% - 6/16 (6/14 yesterday)

18+ Numbers (72.5% Now)

75% - 6/4 (6/3 yesterday)

65+ Numbers (89.4% Now)

90% - 7/21 (7/17 yesterday)

95% - 9/3 (8/28 yesterday)

7 Day Rolling Average (really 5 days) is 26,363 first dose shots."
6845,Like I said that might fluctuate wildly over the next two days due to the calculations being only based on 5 days and not the uptake itself.
6846,If there is any data anyone wants to see or a different way of presenting the data lmk.
6847,Just look at the articles when Italy prevented 250.000 doses from being exported.
6848,"Vaccines are still being distributed and as time goes on people will notice that people who are vaccinated are not only living their lives, but they are not getting sick."
6849,That will make them want a vaccine too.
6850,Anglophone media are mocking EU for slow vaccination and in the same time attacking for not exporting enough of vaccines.
6851,They are crap.
6852,The good news is people who are bad at science are also bad at math.
6853,The lottery seems to work.
6854,People love bad stats on this subreddit as long as it's in favor of the vaccine.
6855,The vaccine is effective enough without this bs
6856,Looks like Ohio started a trend lol
6857,They could have gone with 50ug but the phase 1 trial was 25/100/250.
6858,"They tried 100 vs 50 later on, it worked but they didn't want to waste a few weeks..."
6859,Y’all qaeda
6860,My heart goes out to the families who lost someone to Covid-19 before they had a chance to get a vaccine.
6861,Did you read the article?
6862,"We will get higher, once it is fully approved."
6863,"Once it is accessible in very rural areas, once we actually start vaccinations for POC which in many states is very behind."
6864,[removed]
6865,It's actually Biontech/Fosun in China.
6866,Biontech partnered with Fosun Pharma for the Chinese market and not Pfizer.
6867,The Fosun partnership predates the Pfizer partnership.
6868,61.6% have received at least 1 dose.
6869,I believe we will reach herd immunity.
6870,I am fully vaccinated.
6871,I still wear a mask and socially distance.
6872,Why?
6873,I have 3 kids at home under the age of 12.
6874,I am going to continue until all 3 are vaccinated.
6875,"One day, but at the moment we don’t know what the cutoff level is to be immune."
6876,This is very good news because we're still vaccinating 1.8 million people per day on average.
6877,It should bump up to 70% quite easily.
6878,61% have one dose.
6879,Covid is mild for the majority of people.
6880,[Because they are doing a separate trial for kids 6 months to under 12 years.
6881,](https://investors.modernatx.com/news-releases/news-release-details/moderna-announces-first-participants-dosed-phase-23-study-0)
6882,Precisely.
6883,"If that particular point was
 hammered home in the communication we get from the government and the media, it might help to overcome our vaccine hesitancy."
6884,We are a victims of our own success - sitting ducks tbh.
6885,So sad that we are only going to reach that proportion.
6886,How can one refuse a FREE dose of something HARMLESS which protects them from a dangerous virus?
6887,Truly mind-boggling.
6888,Have these people ever heard of Polio?
6889,Vaccines have saved millions of lives but yet a large portion of our population have the luxury and the gall to refuse a simple shot.
6890,"Yeah, we are totally not ready for the Crisis of the 21st century."
6891,Federal law would almost certainly trump state law in this.
6892,"It's not going to happen, so it is a moot point."
6893,I would need to see a comparative study of in person learning of the entirety of the child population versus the amount missing school due to an influence of Covid infection to make any type of assumption on what you are implying.
6894,Would be really interesting to see but I think we are reaching a point of abstract assumptions for us to make any head way in changing the other persons opinion.
6895,"Why couldn't Moderna included 11 year olds in their trial, knowing that Pfizer was going to be approved first for the same exact age group?"
6896,It could have made their approval much more exciting.
6897,That FA cup final was probably a once in a lifetime experience for those Leicester fans.
6898,"Just got my second shot today, oddly enough."
6899,"Hoping the side effects aren't too bad, round 1 slowed me down a bit!"
6900,"&gt; Like, what was the point of all that death?"
6901,Oil and defense contracts for already disgustingly filthy rich people.
6902,"Oh that, and also so someone could prove to his daddy that he was a big boy."
6903,That's pretty much it.
6904,The us will use it as a political tool.
6905,Vaccines for allies first.
6906,A lot of the people at those vents won't have received a first dose yet.
6907,You had to show a negative test to gain entry.
6908,It's also because this sub is quickly losing regular viewership as COVID is no longer a daily concern or even a passing thought to most anymore.
6909,Meaning the people who are left are the most concerned and interested - the most likely to continue to believe measures are needed.
6910,"I just want to thank you so much for this comment that highlights the importance of using a Bayesian analysis, or at the least include confidence intervals."
6911,Reporting on this number is consistently misleading.

6913,F covid all my homies hate covid
6914,This is the dumbest comment I’ve read today.
6915,This is my boyfriends stance.
6916,He had it in January and doesn’t see the need in getting the shot right now regardless of my bitching at him to get it.
6917,Does this include minding your business with respect to parents who chose not to vaccinate their children?
6918,Just want to see if your “mind your business” pendulum swings in both directions.
6919,Why do people on this site think only Repubs are anti vax?
6920,Ever seen vaccination statistics for whites vs blacks/hispanics?
6921,"But no, this is Reddit, so white people bad and republicans bad."
6922,"It's actually relevant to the topic, though."
6923,"Sucks for some people, and we actually have more proof of cases with athletes"
6924,"I don't see where you're getting 1 in 627,329 unless you're baselessly assuming all 101 million people have been exposed to the virus and are including them in your calculation."
6925,Of all the vaccines worldwide the two Chinese ones have indisputably the worst results and worst efficacy.
6926,That said better than getting covid that's for sure
6927,"We saw this trend from Israel, and I'm really glad it's come to fruition."
6928,The bottom seems to be completely dropping out.
6929,This is just about the end for COVID in the US.
6930,Hopefully the rest of the world will see how well the vaccines work and have similar or better results.
6931,"I know we have a lot of anti vax idiots in the US, but we don't have a monopoly on anti vax or vaccine hesitancy."
6932,"it's not apple to apple, how long these 101 million have been under fully vaccinated?"
6933,"0-3 month mostly, and I would consider 21 days after 2nd doses to be breakthrough ( since technically you supposed get full protect 14 days after 2nd doses."
6934,and 5-7 days to show symptoms)
6935,50 percent is probably the best we are gonna get.
6936,Also DeWine million dollar lottery was genius.
6937,Only 5 winners and yet hundreds of thousands got shots.
6938,Money is the only motivation that gets results.
6939,I wasn't referring to the kids who had symptoms longer than 12 weeks.
6940,Even missing or failing to participate fully in school for a few months could result in failure to pass classes and missing information and knowledge that could be harmful for kids' educational development.
6941,This isn't idle speculation either.
6942,There have been many [studies](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0264410X19307868) on the effects of measles vaccination efforts that find that vaccinating kids increases their cognitive development and educational attainment relative to those who were not vaccinated.
6943,"Clearly, the vaccine isn't making kids smarter, so what they are measuring is the benefit of eliminating the deleterious effects of kids getting sick during critical phases of their lives."
6944,"Obviously, COVID-19 and measles are different diseases, but given the information I've shared already, it is possible that the developmental delays caused by COVID are at least comparable to those caused by measles."
6945,These have been great ideas to get people on the fence to get vaccinated.
6946,Sure wish I lived in one of these vaccine lottery states though winning a million dollars just for protecting myself from covid would be pretty dope
6947,"You're saying that over 1,000 Americans are killed by meteorites a year?"
6948,This sounds like a problem we need to address.
6949,"Related: something like 300 people die per day to earthquakes in Tehran, and 10,000 people per year die to the eventual yellowstone eruption."
6950,I think the incidence of infection (4 of 3000 across both arms) and morbidity/mortality resulting from those infections (none reported) inform the overall assessment of risk/benefit.
6951,Lol did you forget what subreddit you’re on?
6952,"“You reek of COVID.”

6953,"The National Weather service says that you have a 1-in-15,300 of getting struck by lightning in your lifetime (assuming 80 years of life)."
6954,I like that one better.
6955,"Great, COVID-21 here we come."
6956,North Korea had a 30 day quarantine right from the start.
6957,There are rare cases with very long incubation times so with China being as large as it is and with new variants being so contagious they would be concerned about breakthrough cases.
6958,Umm 5G has entered the chat
6959,"It’s good that the influencer did a little research, thought something was off, and then declined the project."
6960,"Like you say, just because an email claims to be from a particular person or firm doesn’t mean that it is."
6961,You're making it sound like society is going to collapse.
6962,"Meanwhile, I outlined the exact issues that businesses across the country stated were problematic once the guidance was issued."
6963,You seem to think I mean this is catastrophic.
6964,"It isn't, but a lot of places could have used more leadtime to higher more employees, bolster inventory, update signage, verify they aren't violating OSHA policy, train staff to deal with new policies, alter their physical spaces accordingly, etc."
6965,You are tone deaf if you don't think changing a policy overnight wasn't difficult for businesses.

6969,"Get off the cross, we need the wood."
6970,[removed]
6971,They could've tied it to a 70% vaccination rate instead of announcing it when the population vaccination rate was around 30%
6972,The best way for people who are unsure or cautious is getting the vaccine into their local doctor office so they can talk to their doctor about it.
6973,These people aren’t going to be convinced by some random tv ad and definitely won’t make the drive to a vaccination site.
6974,"But have them talk to their trusted doctor, and millions of Americans will get vaccinated."
6975,It’s a slow but worthwhile project.
6976,I took ibuprofen a few hours after both my doses:( The nurse said I could take Advil.
6977,I thought the advisory was only for before the dose?
6978,Ugh hope I havent messed up my vaccine.
6979,You don't understand the meaning of an independent DOJ then.
6980,"Good , we should charge them all with it, but America won’t, wait and see"

6982,COVID can suck it.
6983,Read it again.

6986,"I'm fully vaccinated and not worried, but I don't feel like giving my immune system something to practice with."
6987,This extends to everything.

6989,Guys remember they beat covid?
6990,Only trains and Tokyo showrooms are high tech.

7035,"Those who are infected are sent to Covid Units to isolate away from their family, and the whole city adopts strict measures."
7036,"You say ""too strict"" even though measures have only been strict when covid has been detected."
7037,"Outside of that, they've been rather mild."
7038,It's the power of reacting immediately and squashing any outbreak before it can properly begin.

7054,"But we excuse Biden cause he isn't an overt dumbass, much like you're currently doing being caught up on rhetoric"
7055,Mask wearing is still basically universal in stores with posted signs where I live because people are mostly polite as you say.
7056,And at places like outdoor malls I understand people don't want to put the mask on and back off again repeatedly.

7071,The latter is just as closed-minded as saying it 100% came from a lab.
7072,And I agree that there’s a need to be precise with language.

&gt;Q."
7085,What would be *****a fair rate to say we have reached***** herd immunity?
7086,&gt;A.
7087,"If we were dealing with a virus that doesn’t change, then the mathematicians could work out ***what proportion of the population has to be vaccinated in order to stop the virus in its tracks***."
7088,"&gt;So, herd immunity is when you can really stop circulation just by vaccinating enough people."
7089,We know for measles that you need over 95% of people vaccinated.
7090,"For some other viruses, it may only be 80% or 75%."
7091,"&gt;But for this virus, it is changing."
7092,So herd immunity for the original strain last year would have been possible.
7093,"But we’re now dealing with different variants, which will continue to emerge and transmit in vaccinated populations."
7094,&gt;I think we should forget herd immunity.
7095,It’s the wrong concept because of the variants.
7096,&gt; The virus will find ways of transmitting in immune populations.
7097,"In a sense, the real question is what proportion of people need to be vaccinated, that will minimize the number of people going to the hospital, or maybe even stop it completely."
7098,&gt;I think it is actually a very high proportion of the population who are at risk and need to be vaccinated.
7099,"And the difficulty is that even if you vaccinated everyone over the age of 50, that will stop 99% of the hospitalizations."
7100,"But then, if we give up at that point, then younger adults, the under-50s, will still get the disease."
7101,"And because there’s so many of them in all of our countries, some of those people will be vulnerable and will go into hospital."
7102,&gt;It is a difficult one balancing the requirement to try to minimize hospitalizations.
7103,"Once you’ve vaccinated the over-50s, the next step in programs, hopefully when most of the world is protected, is going to be to start to vaccinate wider in the under-50s."
7104,[removed]
7105,Masks are so minor cause all other restrictions.
7106,Capacity restrictions are what is hurting businesses.
7107,An important thing to do is check what the actual case rates are in your county/city.
7108,You can’t catch Covid if nobody in the store has it.
7109,"If cases are actually high in your area, use curbside pickup or delivery, and take your kids outside to the park or zoo to socialize and get out of the house."
7110,"I agree, and it's a huge problem."
7111,Probably _the biggest_ problem we have.
7112,"I'm somewhat surprised to be honest that they get hit hard right now, they seemed to have it under control for the longest time."
7113,"I tend to watch ... weird stuff on my TV when getting ready to fall asleep, one of which happens to be ""walk"" videos, some from Tokio, and you pretty much see everyone there wear masks even on outside on the street the entire time (alas not keeping their distance though ...), so I thought with that disciplined behaviour they dodged a bullet."

7134,"I'm of the belief there was an accident, researchers caught it, and then it quickly mutated+spread."
7135,Idk how suggesting that it's potentially manmade when the known origin of the virus is in China isn't implicitly racist.
7136,It's blaming China without explicitly blaming China but gives all the validity in the world to those with anti China sentiments.
7137,That's still racist af.
7138,"I vaguely recall that Pfizer found in testing that a higher amount of their vaccine didn't change the efficacy, so Moderna's vaccine likely isn't stronger."

7207,"They are not equally dumb because unless there is proof, by definition it is baseless."
7208,There is literally 0 proof it came from a lab and saying it did is just conjuncture at this point.
7209,So it is 100% baseless.
7210,"Now, is it possible that there would be reasonable amount of proof that would convincingly prove that it came from a lab?"
7211,Probably.
7212,But that doesn't make anyone who said it definitely came from a lab right if they were just basing it on their biases and stereotypes and not actual proof.
7213,I dont have an idea where it came from.
7214,"But unless there is proof one way or another, I would call any assertion baseless."
7215,&gt;That doesn’t mean we need to avoid discussion—or even speculation—on this topic.
7216,No one here is stopping discussion.
7217,"There is a need to be really clear on the language and despite Dr.Fauci being careful about what he says, even it is being misrepresented to suit agendas."
7218,And speculation without basis is pointless because that spreads misinformation since people take speculation as facts as long as it proves their bias.

7220,"If they didn't think about employee safety and ignored the severity of the pandemic, they deserve to face consequences."
7221,Protectionism for companies is just a double standard.
7222,"One correction - The Pfizer is three weeks between doses, and technically has the two week waiting period for full immunity to develop, making it a five week process to full vaccination."
7223,"Otherwise I agree these are very similar, though anecdotal comments seem to indicate a bit more side effects from Moderna."

7347,I agree with your assertion that this is an unusual situation.
7348,It required some effort to determine what happened.
7349,We couldn't make any assumptions until the data was in.
7350,"However, it should be noted that scientists (in the area of airflow) knew that some transmission via aerosols was happening and they were ignored rather rudely in favor of a constant (5 microns) that no-one knew where it came from."
7351,The WHO panel was unwilling to listen to them or research the issue more fully.
7352,They in fact cut them off citing this 5 micron constant as criteria for what's considered airborne.
7353,"As it turns out, most of the respiratory viruses have some level of aersol transmission."
7354,It's fairly obvious that flu transmits that way as well.
7355,"Of course these viruses also transmit via droplets and surfaces, but the five micron constant was just accepted as fact with no room for argument."
7356,"There was no common sense in that if course there's nuance, as droplets of larger size can be suspended in air, just for shorter time periods."
7357,In fact flu viruses have long been found in areas they should not be if the prevailing wisdom were true (like air vents for example).
7358,Yet no-one questioned the prevailing wisdom as they should have.

7578,Weird.
7579,I don't recall people specifically saying it wasn't airborne.
7580,"I do recall people thinking it spread through surfaces, of course."
7581,But not only that way.
7582,A plateau requires a reproductive rate very near to 1 and is not sustainable.
7583,We'll either have R&lt;1 and cases go to 0 or R&gt;1 and everyone (in a particular area) will catch it.
7584,R values are going to be different for each different strain.
7585,We don't actually know which lineages are different strains (versus simply variants).
7586,R(t) is certainly much less than 1 for B.1.1.7 and B.1.526 which account for the large majority of cases in the country.
7587,R(t) may be near to 1 but is probably below for P.1.
7588,"R(t) may still be above 1, possibly well above 1, for B.1.617.2, but there aren't enough cases of this for it to matter for some time."
7589,"Of course we know that vaccines are basically fully effective against all current lineages, so dealing with more contagious lineages just means vaccinating more people."
7590,"The actual R(t) depends on the serial interval between transmissions which is just guessed at (the CDC has a study that shows an algebraic average of 3.96, for instance - but the algebraic average isn't actually the relevant value here sadly)."
7591,But weekly growth is a great proxy.
7592,We're currently at -24% per week; at that pace we're something like 6 weeks away from 10k cases a day (an arbitrary but reasonable milestone for the end of the pandemic).
7593,"However that pace of shrinking is accelerating so it might be faster (we are still vaccinating 3-4% of the unvaccinated per week, dropping R(t) by a similar amount after whatever delay period)."
7594,"In the best case scenario, local transmissions will go to 0 for any R(t)&lt;1 value everywhere in the US, but we'll still get a steady trickle of imported cases for the next months at least."
7595,"This could look like a plateau, but it would be such a tiny one we wouldn't care."
7596,Watching Israel should give us some idea of where our future should be - if we can match their vaccination rate.
7597,[Here](https://www.businessinsider.com/coronavirus-patients-zero-contracted-case-november-2020-3) is closest we have which is from Hubei province.
7598,"In addition, latest signals from WHO motors virus likely came from Southern China

7599,There also needs to be some way for people that can't get the vaccine or 2nd dose because of a legitimate medical reason or serious adverse reaction to the 1st dose to prove that they can't actually get fully vaccinated.
7600,I'll preface this by saying I still think everyone should get the vaccine despite my unfortunate experience...
7601,"I was enthusiastic to get fully vaccinated, then ended up hospitalized for a pulmonary embolism between doses (healthy 31 y.o."
7602,"with no risk factors or history or clots), and was advised by my doctor and the hospital pulmonologist not to return for my 2nd dose (may not have been the vaccine, but the coincidence is too strong to ignore, such that it's not worth the risk to me as an individual to risk a 2nd dose triggering another clotting episode)."
7603,Now I'm dreading being dismissed as an anti-vaxxer and losing my right to participate in civil society because I was unlucky enough to be one of the few individuals who have a serious adverse reaction to the 1st dose.
7604,"I'm all for businesses requiring proof of vaccination, but there there needs to be a verifiable work around for myself and the other unfortunate souls that can't get their 2nd dose because of a documented adverse reaction to the first dose, so we're not dismissed and lumped on with the anti-vaxxers and the people who had the b.s."

7612,Does anyone honestly think that if China was building a weapon they are going to publicly admit that before the whole world?
7613,It would take naivety boarding on rubishness to believe that.
7614,So in the end 1-4 amount to the same thing politically even if they might not mean the same thing scientifically.
7615,Always thought that as well ugh..........
7616,Then allow sports betting on it to up the stakes.
7617,[deleted]
7618,I didn’t say the consensus was changing (maybe you aren’t alleging that).
7619,"Like I said, I found the article balanced and an exposition of what we know and what do not."
7620,Just thought it a helpful resource.
7621,Oh you were being sarcastic?
7622,It's great they're doing it through school.
7623,Our district is trying to set up a program for the summer.
7624,"I actually just got a call an hour ago that the Texas Dept of Health had an opening for my daughter, so they're really starting to roll it out."

7626,The extreme Chinese propaganda that came out around this virus  and other circumstances makes it very suspicious.
7627,-	Originates 2-3 miles away from one of the few labs on planet earth that studies this sort of thing.
7628,"-	Chinese government covers up everything extensively 
-	Chinese media pushes our idea of everyone falling dead in street randomly and mainstream USA media believe it lol."
7629,The president then said he believed it came from China.
7630,This was laughed  at and social media would ban you for saying as such.
7631,Now everyone is trying to pretend like never happened.
7632,My daughter (11) basically asked for a vaccine for her birthday (late July.)
7633,Kid you’re getting that anyway.
7634,"Since you asked, I researched a little bit, [this is what I found](https://static.poder360.com.br/2021/05/Estudo-Argentina.pdf)"

7636,"In my state, no one is checking to see if the person who signed the consent is an actual parent."
7637,Or if they actúally exist.
7638,A kid could grab a bum off the street to play guardian and no one would ask any questions.
7639,I have absolutely zero problems with this.
7640,I have submitted articles about this that get down voted into oblivion.
7641,As far as reddit is concerned the end of coronavirus means the end of infectious diseases everywhere for all time.
7642,I believe the mRNA code is identical or nearly so.
7643,It just encodes for the creation of a prefusion-locked spike protein.
7644,"The protein might be marginally different (I don't think so), and both companies do have new-strain booster versions that also may be different."
7645,The dosage is different and the tested interval between shots is different.
7646,"They use a different lipid shell that might be absorbed by cells differently, or have marginally different storage requirements."
7647,This post appears to be about vaccines.

7651,"I had Moderna too, and the same reaction as OC... Sore arm for #1 and basically slept the whole day after #2."
7652,"I felt quite cheated because I'd gone and bought Valheim right before my second shot, thinking that I'd take advantage of having the day off to get in some sweet gaming time, and ended up laying in bed for 12 hours."
7653,"For what it's worth, my fiance had the exact same reaction with Pfizer #2."
7654,We got our second shots on the same day so it was almost like a sleep date.
7655,Take your niece for a visit to the COVID ward at your local hospital.
7656,Problem solved.
7657,We got an RSV vaccine in trials yet?
7658,"Not really - the western world will immediately scream ""OMG FORGED/PHOTOSHOPPED"""

7677,[removed]
7678,&gt; That's a lot of downvotes for stating the obvious.
7679,"Saying that the threat-level is comparable to the flu *among people who are fully vaccinated* is very different to calling Covid in general ""just the flu""."
7680,"The former has a lot of truth to it, the latter would make someone a reality-denying idiot, which we've already seen far too many of this pandemic."
7681,[removed]
7682,"yes i read that too   WSJ    that is what i have been thinking for a long time   ..

i also read an article that satellites scanned hospitals around wuhan before the outbreak  and they found a substantial increase in traffic  in parking lots .. this was another attempt to find origin .. and of course this is not scientific but it is interesting

7690,Get vaccinated and your dogs will smile.
7691,I did mute the stories after a while.
7692,:)
7693,This is it.
7694,"Otherwise reasonable people have been shooting down the lab leak theory for a long time, as the scientific consensus (relatively early) was that the genome did not have any of the hallmarks of artificial synthesis."
7695,That always seemed like flawed logic to me.
7696,"It's like if a rhino was found a few blocks away from a zoo and biologists came out and said ""the DNA seems to be of natural origin"" and the general public took it as ""See there's no way it could've come from the zoo!"""
7697,"No one knows what really happened, but the coincidences with this one keep piling up."
7698,"China, if they don't have any knowledge of a lab leak, certainly aren't doing any favors when obfuscating the investigation at every turn."

7700,"Natural transmission or lab leak, we need to understand how this happened."
7701,Is it just that those in power are truly that afraid to hold China's feet to the fire?

7711,"The parking lot was staffed by Nat'l Guard, DHS, and FEMA personnel (you'd think many of them were volunteers, they were dressed like civilians)."
7712,"I think the only medical personnel on-site were the ones administering the shots, and I'm guessing there were six of them at any one time."

7717,I work in an elementary school.
7718,"Our kindergarteners have spent about ~20% of their life during covid, and they don’t have memories of much of the remaining 80%."
7719,"Many of my youngest students don’t remember going to or have never been to a library, birthday party, vacation, etc."
7720,"If parents took covid super seriously and their child is now 3, the child has effectively had no outside the house experiences after 18 months."
7721,"The effect on older kids seems to be much less, in my opinion, as they have experienced all those things and know what they are potentially going back to."
7722,The impact on the life skills and social skills of small children is significant and real.
7723,I get that you wish this was over.
7724,We all do.
7725,But... when was the last time you had a serious illness that it took you six months to recover from?
7726,What was that like for you?
7727,"We've all had a solid year of governments gaslighting people  with:  ""Kids don't get this"" , ""Kids don't spread this."
7728,""", ""It's just like the flu for kids"", to now ""sure, 10%-30% of kids who get COVID experience long Covid symptoms ... but it's totally ok because \*most\* of them recover in ... six months?"
7729,"Most?"""
7730,"Because, of course, our society doesn't properly function if parents need to stay home and take care of their family, if the schools are all closed."
7731,"Literally all the money in the world depended on this somehow not affecting kids, as if they didn't use their lungs like the rest of us."
7732,"And there's still all the pressure in the world to soft-sell any effect this has on kids, again, because the money needs us all back in the office."
7733,6 months of long covid is nothing to take lightly.
7734,"In fact, knowing several friends and neighbors who've had long covid, it's awful."
7735,"If you're a decent person capable of some sort of empathy for other people, maybe you can consider chilling out until we're actually able to get kids vaccinated."

7744,"hmm I wouldnt put it past it being a lab leak, not for malicous intent, but this wouldnt be the first time china had poor safety standards, hell Sars-Cov-1 was a lab escape too."
7745,"6 weeks later, and this sounds about right."

7751,Calling it racist and xenophobic.
7752,The issue we had was many different opinions that had nuance but people didn't listen to the nuance.
7753,It's still happening today even with this revelation.
7754,"I don't know anyone of importance who said the idea that the virus could have been accidentally leaked from the Wuhan lab was racist or xenophobic, if you have quotes from people saying that I'd love to see them."
7755,I can't wait to go to Bingo again!
7756,A basic understanding of science?
7757,“All”?
7758,You can dismiss it if you want but it’s pretty incorrect to say with conviction that kids aren’t affected by Covid.
7759,There’s still more to learn.
7760,I would think.
7761,I was part of a strike team at a rural prison.
7762,\~70% of that population tested positive and most of them had little or no symptoms.
7763,"I'm not comparing a prison , as some microcosm to society, but it is telling in terms of symptoms."
7764,"The again, most of those guys were young and healthy."
7765,This is speculation but  I'm also inclined to believe that the reasons schools haven't had major breakouts is but for the fact that the kids did catch it but never knew they had it.
7766,Huh.
7767,That's an interesting way to dismiss people with arguments you don't understand.

7910,"Others decided to intentionally ignore their experience: ""Hey, China is building a big new hospital because of the outbreak and locking down Wuhan - the virus is probably harmless, let's go on a vacation and take it home"""
7911,I don't think so.

7913,He's been on Fox news several times.
7914,"He has previously written a book that basically said black people are genetically predisposed to being less intelligent (""A Troublesome Inheritance"".)"
7915,He claims too many crazy things to list but a reasonable summary is a direct quote from the book.
7916,"He says research into genetics of races is ""shaped by leftist and Marxist political dogma, not by science.”

I have yet to hear anyone who really understands what's possible in a lab- ie a real virology researcher- say that a lab leak is anything other than very unlikely or impossible."
7917,You’re assuming “slight decrease in their chances”.

7933,Gotcha.
7934,No wonder.
7935,That explains everything.
7936,But I won't be going back to a theater until that mask mandate is removed.
7937,Nothing's more stiffling or uncomfortable than wearing a mask in an audotorium where you can't even breathe... sheesh!
7938,"I'm not sure if you noticed, but they effectively defeated the virus any time it flared up, and without a vaccine."
7939,They did that through hard work and willpower.
7940,The goal was to ensure their population was safe.
7941,That seems incredibly at odds with what you are claiming.
7942,&gt;We all do.
7943,But... when was the last time you had a serious illness that it took you six months to recover from?
7944,What was that like for you?
7945,Appeal to emotion.
7946,I have had a serious respiratory illness as a kid(lasted over a year).
7947,It sucked.
7948,I thankfully recovered.
7949,Why should this influence my interpretation of the data?
7950,&gt;but it's totally ok because *most* of them recover in ... six months?
7951,Yes.
7952,Why shouldn’t it be?
7953,"Per the study no deaths, signs of long lasting complications,  and 45/46 are back in school."
7954,"&gt;	And there’s still all the pressure in the world to soft-sell any effect this has on kids, again, because the money needs us all back in the office."
7955,Probably because the actual threat to children is statistically not large enough to warrant the continued shut down of the world.
7956,"&gt;	If you’re a decent person capable of some sort of empathy for other people, maybe you can consider chilling out until we’re actually able to get kids vaccinated."
7957,More appeals to emotions.
7958,"Instead of sticking to facts and logic, you want to use this fallacy to convince others."
7959,I wonder why that is?

7981,Tbh I wish she would have been able to come here to get the moderna or Pfizer vaccine.
7982,I worry for her since she's so elderly.
7983,It'll be interesting to see how exactly this is rolled out; if they will move through priority groups or just let anyone who wants to show up earlier to do so.
7984,"But regardless, the fact that this is even possible speaks volumes to how well the rollout has been and is still going."
7985,"I think flying first class and free, you'd manage"
7986,"Where you say ""Rest two weeks to one month"", it should be 90 days."

7997,"I think the last few days Fairfax county has had fewer than 30 new cases, and Loudoun fewer than 10."
7998,"To play Devil's Advocate for a second... if the US had been the origin of the virus instead of China, would we have fallen over backwards to hurry up and let Chinese and Russian investigators come here and figure it out?"

8159,Yep.
8160,People were getting banned from Twitter just for saying this

8164,I'm just noting facts.
8165,We should just state facts with evidence.
8166,"That's best way to proceed, right?"
8167,What about the WHO do you feel they did right or wrong and why?
8168,They paid more attention to the well being of their people than Europe or the US.

We would gladly buy BNT/Pfizer directly from them... but won't allow a third party Chinese company to distribute, let alone produce, such sensitive goods."
8172,Taiwan vs China or the ROC vs PRC... it's the same war for the same thing.
8173,Taiwan simply wants to defend its sovereignty.
8174,There was an agreed upon median line in the Taiwan Strait that the PRC continues to cross.
8175,"No bullying is okay, past or present."
8176,"If you haven't realized yet, the majority of Taiwanese do not support the KMT or the way they acted in the past when the island was under martial law and the Taiwanese had zero input on how their government functions."
8177,"Lol, not my state."

8184,"The only real way to evaluate the risk is to compare it to the alternative, which is a very high likelihood of eventually contracting COVID."
8185,No one can say what the long term effects are until the long term has happened.

8187,Israel is at 62% vaccinated (total population).
8188,...or people were listening to the many experts (many of whom have colleagues working in China or even in the Wuhan lab) who all agreed there was no evidence it was from a lab leak.
8189,I don't think there is even any evidence now that it was from a lab leak.
8190,And guess what?
8191,"If damning evidence shows up, I'll jump on the lab leak train."
8192,That's how this is supposed to work.
8193,You're supposed to follow the evidence.
8194,Several of my friends believe it was from a lab and the only reason they do is because they hate China.
8195,"Before we even knew much about Covid-19, my friends already ""knew"" the origins - it was a bioweapon leak!"
8196,"To be 100% clear (otherwise I'm sure you'll twist what I'm saying,) it still could end up being an accidental lab leak."
8197,It could.
8198,It could also be 100% animal to human in nature.
8199,So I suggest people stop pretending they have some real idea of the origin and let the investigation shed more light on the facts first.

8201,"The marriage license should be annulled, couple should be sent to prison."

8225,Haven’t received anything.
8226,Will contact my GP?
8227,I understand what was being discussed.
8228,Only example of a 2nd dose roll-out is the smaller scale ones we have seen so far.
8229,"No idea how they are going to achieve this, will be interesting to see it unfold!"
8230,"I'm asking what you would consider to be a reasonable limit on movement given that the spread of coronavirus in the UK is near zero, thanks to high levels of vaccination and strict movement restrictions."
8231,"With those movement restrictions taken away, unvaccinated people are not spreading the virus (for the most part), thanks to collective immunity."
8232,"So why should unvaccinated people not be able to meet with their friends for a walk or a drink outside, given that their meeting does not seem to cause significant spread of the virus?"
8233,"&gt;Now get a vaccine and tell all of your friends to do the same

Why would I not want to get a vaccine?"
8234,"I absolutely do, it's just that they're limited in the UK by age range."
8235,"All being well, I may be able to get one next week."
8236,People younger than me may have to wait up to 2 more months.
8237,"My point is that the vaccination programme requires young people to be on board with the UK plan, which has involved excluding young people from vaccination for more than 6 months."
8238,"If you also think that young people should accept not being able to go for a walk with a friend, you are seriously undermining trust in the healthcare system and in the rules which govern movement at the moment."
8239,I hope you understand that that sort of thing has an impact and that young people can't be asked to suspend their lives indefinitely while older people are holidaying around Europe.
8240,[removed]
8241,No.
8242,New Zealand has a similar GDP to Greece and Australia had a plan to locally produce the AstraZenica vaccine (something that Canada can't do) but that has been scuppered by the negative AZ press.
8243,The government has since bought enough Pfizer for everyone under 50.
8244,"While the vaccine rollout hasn't been brilliant, Australia has had one death since mid December last year who was a returned traveler."
8245,You crow about your vaccine rollout but how many deaths have happened since December?
8246,Yes but I don't think that's why the vast majority of people here are complaining about them.

May 25, 2021, 8:00 a.m."
8248,"ET

Moderna said on Tuesday that its coronavirus vaccine, authorized only for use in adults, was powerfully effective in 12- to 17-year-olds, and that it planned to apply to the Food and Drug Administration in June for authorization to use the vaccine in adolescents."
8249,"If approved, its vaccine would become the second Covid-19 vaccine available to U.S. adolescents."
8250,Federal regulators authorized the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine this month for 12- to 15-year-olds.
8251,"The Pfizer shot was initially authorized for use in people 16 and older, while Moderna’s has been available for those 18 and up."
8252,Proof of the vaccines’ efficacy and safety for adolescents is helping school officials and other leaders as they plan for the fall.
8253,"On Monday, Mayor Bill de Blasio said that all public school students in New York City, the largest school system in the United States, would return to in-person learning in the fall."
8254,"New York’s move comes as several states have indicated that they will restrict remote learning, including Connecticut, Illinois, Massachusetts and New Jersey."
8255,"The Moderna results, which the company announced in a statement, are based on a clinical trial that enrolled 3,732 people ages 12 to 17, two-thirds of whom received two vaccine doses."
8256,"There were no cases of symptomatic Covid-19 in fully vaccinated adolescents, the company reported."
8257,"That translates to an efficacy of 100 percent, the same figure that Pfizer and BioNTech reported in a trial of their vaccine in 12- to 15-year-olds."
8258,"“These look like promising results,” said Dr. Kristin Oliver, a pediatrician and vaccine expert at Mount Sinai Hospital in New York."
8259,"“The more vaccines we have to protect adolescents from Covid, the better.”

Moderna also reported that a single dose of its vaccine had 93 percent efficacy against symptomatic disease."
8260,"“Those cases that did occur between the two doses were mild, which is also a good indicator of protection against disease,” Saskia Popescu, an infectious disease epidemiologist at George Mason University, said in an email."
8261,"The side effects were consistent with what has been reported in adults: pain at the site of the injection, headache, fatigue, muscle pain and chills."
8262,"“No significant safety concerns have been identified to date,” the company said."
8263,The adolescents in the study will be monitored for a year after their second dose.
8264,The results were announced in a news release that did not contain detailed data from the clinical trial.
8265,"And Dr. Rasmussen said that the vaccines’ efficacy can be trickier to evaluate in children, who are less likely to develop symptomatic disease than adults."
8266,"Nevertheless, she said, the results are in line with what scientists expected and suggest “that adolescents respond to the vaccine comparably to adults who receive it.”

Moderna said it planned to submit the data for publication in a peer-reviewed journal."
8267,"Not had my 2nd Pfizer dose yet, but the 1st dose hit me harder (and weirder) than I expected."
8268,Death isn't the only negative outcome of disease - no parent wants to see their kid grow up with a complication that we later learn was due to covid exposure
8269,You’re right - they’re just grouped together so much I merged them in my brain.
8270,It’s 2-11 and then 6mo-2.
8271,But both are expected by Pfizer by EOY.

8273,&gt; This has been discussed multiple times on TWiV.
8274,"&gt; 
&gt; This is mostly a concern where people cannot be sure they have been given a real vaccine (fakes, etc), or if they are traveling to countries that do not recognize the vaccine they have already had."
8275,Thank you for your helpful reply.
8276,Please may I know what TWiV is so I can read more on this information?
8277,Thank you.
8278,Where do you see 76 cases yesterday?
8279,On the VA Dept of Health website it says 654 cases
8280,"No it has nothing to with microchips in Vaccines stuff, the vaccines are not the problemen it's the QR code."
8281,"The QR code has to to be linked to a person and vaccination in a database so it can give back a positive or negative result, if the app is used on e.g a smartphone it's not impossible to use the gps of the smartphone to send the location of that person to the verification server and have it stores on a goverment server."
8282,And I see no use why my goverment should know I spend a week in Greece for some reason.
8283,The technology has been around for decades.
8284,they were working on SARS vaccines long before COVID-19.
8285,It's not that new.
8286,Not to mention MRNA has nothing to do with DNA.
8287,It's like a message that gets destroyed on delivery.
8288,Yet people have been trusting DNA based vaccines for far longer--- even though they do interact directly with your DNA.
8289,"Long COVID has been observed in kids:

&gt; Evidence from the first study of long covid in children suggests that more than half of children aged between 6 and 16 years old who contract the virus have at least one symptom lasting more than 120 days, with 42.6 per cent impaired by these symptoms during daily activities."
8290,&gt; The consequences of long covid in children can be debilitating.
8291,"At a UK parliamentary briefing on 26 January, Mcfarland described how her 14-year-old daughter started to become vacant, weak and unresponsive after catching covid-19 in March 2020."
8292,[Source](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7927578/)
8293,My toddler has a bad immune system ontop of just being at the age where everything goes into her mouth so her risk is slightly higher than the average.
8294,"Ontop of that, I meant I won't be taking her to crowded indoor places, we do still go to the local park at times when there aren't many kids."
8295,"Hence why I hope non vaccinated adults get sidelined and refused on buses and planes and concerts and most indoor places, since there’s no way to know if an unmasked person is vaccinated and contagious."
8296,"&gt;This is not to say that American based airlines are great, but to compare them to various governments vanity projects is a little unfair."
8297,"I was comparing service quality and customer experience, so I think the contrast was fair."
8298,"I agree some of those airlines have problematic foundations, but that doesn't have anything to do with the reality that the ME3 generally have much higher service standards."

&gt;Mutiny is a revolt among a group of people (typically of a military, of a crew or of a crew of pirates) to oppose, change, or overthrow an organization to which they were previously loyal."
8313,"The term is commonly used for a rebellion among members of the military against an internal force, but it can also sometimes mean any type of rebellion against any force."
8314,"Mutiny does not necessarily need to refer to a military force and can describe a political, economic, or power structure in which there is a change of power."

8321,2 and under aren't even supposed to wear masks.
8322,Feel good click bait for a stupid promotional contest.
8323,Pretty sure this is just an ad disguised as a news story.
8324,Bummed out.
8325,Left work yesterday with a surprising email that my company would be allowing fully vaccinated employees go without masks and we would have stickers issued by corporate medical indicating our vaccine status.
8326,Then this morning the two local sites just sent an email saying they will not abide by this policy until further notice with no explanation or indication of a timeline.
8327,So I emailed my boss and the health coordinator to ask why they decided not to update their policy because even if I get a bullshit answer I want to indicate that I’m not happy with refusing to update the policy.
8328,It’s utter BS.
8329,The policy is a very good one and I don’t understand why management is standing in the way when our vaccine numbers are so good and cases are so low in this state.
8330,At this point I care more about the mask policy at work then writ large because I spend more time at work than anywhere else.
8331,"Very difficult for Germany (or most EU countries) to close borders, as most inter-national roads are unmanned, and have been for years."
8332,"Unfortunately - even though our (UKs) borders are theoretically much more secure, we've still been letting huge amount of unnecessary travel for basically the entire past year."
8333,I think the number of tests administered will plummet very soon everywhere.
8334,The people who are against vaccines are also the type of people who wouldn’t get tested unless they are too sick.
8335,People who would test often are now mostly vaccinated.
8336,Vaccinated people are also no longer required to test upon exposure unless they develop symptoms (which would be very rare).
8337,"Finally, some of the work places that tested all their employees weekly don’t do that any longer with most of their employees now being vaccinated."
8338,Wait until we hit Biden's goal of 70% first doses hit would be a start.
8339,Probably need to wear masks again for at least one more winter in public only as well.
8340,"In private though, go nuts (if you're vaccinated)."
8341,It's not hard nor does it have to be as restrictive as before.
8342,"Wow, I'm surprised 6mo to 12 years is the next group."
8343,I would have thought the group would include fewer ages.
8344,6 month olds are so tiny!!
8345,^(context: I'm very much not a parent)
8346,"Testing is decreasing in Virginia, but cases are decreasing at a faster rate."
8347,It doesn't really matter that testing is decreasing as long as your test positivity decreases as well.
8348,"Cases sometimes experience lags, but it's much less common than lagging deaths."
8349,I would say this is a good sign even if the following days see a bit of a course correction.
8350,It's not even too far off from the trajectory that Virginia has been on.
8351,"Sure, it's an accelerated percentage decrease, but that's what we've been seeing across the country."
8352,"Here are the case counts for previous Mondays: 719-&gt;611-&gt;336-&gt;273-&gt;76

Raw difference: -108 -&gt; -275 -&gt; -63 -&gt; -197

Percent decrease: 15% -&gt; 45% -&gt; 19% -&gt; 72%"
8353,Right.
8354,Then it boils down to convenience of one group vs health and safety of another.
8355,I tend to default to health and safety in those cases.
8356,[removed]
8357,"I found a press release from 05 may that states it the way I put it, where did you find your info?"
8358,I have however now also found a press release from 17 may that says it will be used untill WHO no longer declares COVID-19 a pandemic.
8359,That could take a while...
8360,No.
8361,The podcast is an unreliable source.
8362,"If the guy said something interesting, just post a link to that."
8363,Why does it have to involve Joe Rogan at all?
8364,And why do you all get so butt hurt any time someone mentions they don't suck that Joe Rogan dick like you do?
8365,What do you care what someone thinks of Rogan?
8366,"Your point is what the guest said, not what Rogan said, so what's the issue?"
8367,"First you seem to be in reddit long enough to know the basic etiquette that revisions to your posts, particularly major edits (as in evidences supporting your arguments) should be traceable and not mysteriously deleted."
8368,So what you did was just creepy.
8369,Good that I quoted your original reply so at least some of it was still retained.
8370,"Second, you heavily revised a huge chuck of your reasoning just like that, BUT YET retained the exact same tone in your rebuttal."
8371,This suggests to me you are heavily biased to begin with.
8372,I don't really give a damn what makes you do this to be frank (your love for China?
8373,Monetary reasons?
8374,"), but to me what you say no longer has any credibility...."
8375,Sorry man
8376,Ditto!
8377,11 year old didn’t make the cut.
8378,Hoping soon!
8379,Everyone
8380,But they did notify WHO at end of December though.
8381,"Also Xi told Trump it's ""very contagious"" in their personal call in Feb."
8382,I guess they somehow predicted the other countries would sit on their ass for 2 months?
8383,It's far from the end w/ 35-40% of people who are anti-vaxxers or refuse to have it.
8384,"That and given the virus is constantly mutating, we'll have a new strain that the current vaccines are less effective against."
8385,We're not out of the forest yet.
8386,"This video explains efficacy pretty well, it's worth watching

https://youtu.be/K3odScka55A"
8387,In this case we're not talking about specific groups though; those people have already been notified separately.

8390,"I’ve noticed that all my “mostly idiot” but not “totally idiot” acquaintances and coworkers were only willing to get j&amp;j.   I thought their reasoning was pretty silly, unfounded, and confusing."
8391,"But I shut my mouth about all that and went, “that’s awesome that you are getting j&amp;j it’s a great product”"
8392,I'm not anti mask but I'm against kids continuing to wear masks into next school year.
8393,Monica Ghandi and Lucy McBride have been clear on their stance regarding this.
8394,There is not a huge benefit but continued masking can harm their social development.
8395,People don't seem to understand that vaccinated adults help protect kids.
8396,I am having my kid finish the year in masks but thankfully they will not be required next year.
8397,Kids need normal and we've gotten stuck in safetyism and have lost sense of risk.
8398,[removed]
8399,"look I already covered this in other responses, but what should we do for them?"
8400,It’s not like in a year it will work for them.
8401,So do we wear masks indefinitely?
8402,"It’s not officially undercounted, because the numbers are responsibility of the state governments."
8403,It’s just that they are a lot of people who don’t bother to get tested and just let it be.
8404,"People saying that ""Australia and New Zealand are islands that are about as likely to catch this disease as a colony on the far side of the moon"" haven't been following the news down here."
8405,"Despite requiring all incoming travelers quarantine, Australia has had a leak about every 12 days."
8406,"And yet, still not overrun with covid."
8407,Not possible to fake a vax passport if implemented on Algorands blockchain!
8408,That's a lot more context.
8409,US high schools students will have all had 3+ months of vaccine availability in the fall so it does seem reasonable that they could relax mask mandates at least for those who are vaccinated.
8410,"Since you feel strongly, I would suggest writing the school board, explaining how the mandate affects you and your peers and requesting that students who have their vaccination verified be allowed to go maskless."
8411,[deleted]
8412,Recoveries are just bullshit of course.
8413,There is no mechanism.
8414,They just subtract deaths from the total positive cases after 14 days
8415,Could cases go up again?
8416,"Sure, they probably will as it is clearly a seasonal virus."
8417,"However, framing things as if we could see something comparable the three big surges we have seen in the US over the past 14 months is extremely pessimistic."
8418,We will probably entire the fall with at least 75% of the total population protected via either by vaccination or prior infection as well as &gt;90% of seniors.
8419,"Coupling that with the fact that second waves in places like NY/NJ, where protection heading into them via natural immunity was likely closer to 1/3rd, were only like 25% as extreme as their respective first waves, it seems almost impossible that any future outbreaks will place significant stress on the medical system."

8491,*
8492,Thanks for great explanation!
8493,"Very informative, CumFilledAnus"
8494,Me too - had mine on Saturday.
8495,Was getting worried since work is starting to push for us to go back to the office soon.
8496,None beyond a sore arm for a day.
8497,"Because flu isn't as deadly, contagious or widespread as Covid?"
8498,Flu vaccines are also proven to work in the immunocompromised.
8499,*Fewer* people are getting tested.
8500,It's that people who have been vaccinated don't get tested nearly as much.
8501,Hypochondriacs that were testing every week are now vaccinated.
8502,What do you think the % of vaccinated population needs to be until we 'ditch the masks' at a regulatory/advisory level?
8503,[removed]
8504,They are different.
8505,"Emergency Use Authorization is what they have now and, you guessed it, can only be issued during an emergency when fda and its advisors believe that the benefits of using it outweigh the risks."
8506,"The authorization is given based on less data than is required for approval (in this case, fda required at least 2 months of data on at least half of the fully vaccinated trial participants)."
8507,The trials then continue (although I believe they have unblinded the placebo arm and vaccinated them as well s the trial makeup/protocols will have changed by now).
8508,"Full approval often takes years, or even a decade+ in some cases."
8509,It’s almost all about long-term efficacy and safety (although less so of the latter when it comes to vaccines).
8510,"I’ve seen quotes from certain officials (I’m sorry I can’t remember who exactly, possibly Peter marks from fda but maybe somebody who remembers can step in a correct me or verify) that in the case of these vaccines, it’s almost all about how long they work."
8511,Which to me means we could perhaps see full approval in the fall (when they can verify that they work for at least a full year).
8512,"To my knowledge, only Pfizer has actually applied for approval, but I’m sure moderna and j&amp;j aren’t far behind."
8513,"I’m sure there is way more detail and ins and outs, but I think this is a fair summary of the differences."
8514,&gt;  Everyone can get the shot now.
8515,This is just wrong....
8516,They should consider just one dose for kids at those levels.
8517,A lot of side effects come from the second and it looks like overkill
8518,"The trials aren't just in the US, and COVID is going like gangbusters elsewhere in the world."
8519,If anything the timeline to sufficient statistical power in the studies will be shorter.
8520,That's so wrong.
8521,It was for the kids' benefit to be back in school.
8522,Or are you one of those people who think teachers are glorified babysitters?
8523,Well when they had low infection rates for a while the population probably got apathetic.
8524,"Although eastern cultures tend to handle infectious diseases better, they have so few inoculated that any spike in their numbers will be notable because I'm guessing a lot of people there haven't been as careful this deep into the pandemic."
8525,Amen!!
8526,Thanks for doing your part and I hope your family comes around on getting vaccinated.
8527,"I feel like the ""wear masks forever"" thing is a straw man."
8528,"Very few people, if any, are *actually* saying that mask mandates should be permanent, but we haven't reached anywhere near herd immunity and although there seems to be this weird ""Yay, Covid is over!"
8529,"Mission accomplished!"""
8530,"messaging going around, the seven day average death-per-day rate in the US was 650 as of yesterday."
8531,That's 4500 people a week still dying of covid.
8532,"I get that people feel done with covid, but I don't think covid is done with us."
8533,"Negotiating saving millions, when every extra day in lockdown costs billions isn't the smartest thing to do..."
8534,"The vaccines could cost €1000 per person, and it would still be worth it if they were available 6 months ago..."
8535,Masking could also have long term psychological effects though.
8536,"https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/nurturing-resilience/202012/will-wearing-masks-affect-children-s-emotional-development

Not only that, not going outside and moving around could be incredibly detrimental to childhood physical development."
8537,(Assuming an age where the kid is able to go to the park).
8538,Upvote because On The Media is the best show on NPR.
8539,"The stuff about the whole ""must be &lt;5 micron to be airborne"" thing being linked back to ancient studies on TB was really interesting."
8540,"They are basically the same, but emergency approval requires less data and is of course much quicker."
8541,However there were still thousands of participants in studies before the emergency authorization.
8542,"We now have more than enough data for a full approval, after, you know, 200 million people got it."
8543,"If i had to guess we probably have the biggest sample size for any vaccine ever before being fully approved, because there's never been an emergency vaccine authorization at this scale."
8544,and Pfizer is already going for full approval.
8545,That’s why I mentioned the likelihood of severe covid as being very low as well.
8546,Most people recover fine and have mild or no symptoms
8547,"FWIW all living former presidents have received the vaccine, one of them just hasn’t been very public about it."
8548,"I’m fully vaxxed, trying my best to get my family to do the same."

8561,There is a dangerous trend right now towards trying to spread misinformation about the mRNA vaccines to try and turn public opinion and make room for others that haven't been approved yet.

8569,Nope lmao
8570,New Zealand doesn't have any vaccine manufacturing capability so they were always going to rely on international supply.
8571,Australia was planning on producing it's own supply of vaccine but even if there wasn't the issues with AZ it would have taken 40 weeks to produce enough for two doses for the population.
8572,Australia had a plan for vaccinating the entire population using locally supplied vaccines but it went wrong.
8573,Now Australia is in the queue for pfizer vaccines just like all the other countries.
8574,But not being vaccinated doesn't matter because there are so few cases and deaths.
8575,It's essential for the rest of the world to get vaccinated as quickly as possible because it's a life and death situation.
8576,In Australia the argument is about how soon can people travel overseas which is a bit less important.

8595,"It was as if people could not possibly conceive that a world-class, bio research lab regularly might actually have live animals in captivity to serve as hosts......"
8596,I really don’t see the big deal with wearing masks at the food store or malls to help protect each other- outdoors maybe a different story but is it really a big deal inside?
8597,"Open all my indoor events- movies, bowling, everything to full capacity- just keep mask mandate going longer"
8598,Science isn’t a religion.
8599,"You don’t “trust science,” but constantly question and study."
8600,"If everyone “believes science,” we would never make new discoveries."
8601,It isn’t a belief system in any way.
8602,"Pulling kids *out* of school was initially deemed necessary to reduce community spread to older, more vulnerable people."
8603,Putting kids back *in* school is a whole other thing.
8604,"A lot of people pushed for it not for the kids' educational benefit, but to get the national economy back in gear."
8605,Implementation of both remote and in person learning has been...ugh.
8606,"Like, I could go off about this at length (and have) but suffice to say a lot of the studies they used to declare in person learning 'safe' were a little...uh, look, they were using data from schools with 5% in-person learning and extrapolating that to schools with much higher in person learning."
8607,"Also, in my area, they didn't adjust anything about protocol in response to new strains or new information about transmission (airborne vs surfaces)."
8608,"ALSO, and this is the one that really gets me, we can't just talk about transmission rates 'for kids in school' as if they are a single homogenous group."
8609,"Transmission rates are low in elementary school aged kids, yes, but older kids (middle and high school) can spread covid at the same rates as adults."
8610,Kids have totally been used as pawns in both senses of the word: As bargaining chips AND sacrifices.
8611,That's why it annoys me so much when people just casually say that kids should sacrifice more for the convenience of adults.
8612,"Should we be, I don't know, *adults* about it?"
8613,In the early days we knew the suggested outbreak center was a few blocks away from the only lab in China that specifically works on these types of viruses.

8660,"We have picnics, explore plants, watch animals and bugs."

8664,"i fly both and haven't had issues with them, unlike other carrier where I've had uncomfortably tight layovers which I despise."
8665,"The scientists who are pushing this lab leak hypothesis forward today were pushing it forward publicly back Jan/Feb 2020, long before Trump ever mentioned it."
8666,The media and many prominent virologists were claiming it as conspiracy and censoring this topic long before Trump suggested it.
8667,"The point is, this was never about Trump, though he did become involved after the fact but his administration failed to collect any solid evidence for a lab leak hypothesis."
8668,"That said, you are incorrect in saying “all intelligence communities” claimed to debunk it; this never happened."
8669,"The Trump administration failed to gather good evidence and the Biden administration has continued to fail gathering any good evidence... but neither administration *ever* stopped regarding this as a plausible hypothesis and many other countries agreed, including Australia, South Korea, Taiwan, some European countries, etc."

8707,I was pointing out that a lot of people died to make the point that the vaccine is the better choice.
8708,There will always be people that can’t get vaccinated for health reasons.
8709,So with this argument you’re getting into “wear mask forever” territory.
8710,"I may disagree with the stance, but I do appreciate people who openly say they’d prefer mask to be the permanent norm, rather than try to figure out what end date people still against dropping mask insist that they’ll eventually find acceptable."

8748,Wrong
8749,Death or 100% recovery are not the only possible outcomes when catching *any* disease.

8755,"You're gonna put the straps on an IKEA dresser when you know there's a risk of it tipping and crushing your kid, right, however unlikely?"

8774,Did you read the article?
8775,"Yup, whatever it takes to at least get them to take something."
8776,The sticker is on the badge which nobody wears anyway.
8777,Almost everyone keeps in their pocket cause everybody knows everyone else who works here as our team is onto about 20-25 people.
8778,The point is if someone told you to wear a mask you could pull out the badge with the sticker is the idea.
8779,But mainly I just want to stop wearing a mask and I think continuing to require unvaccinated people to wear masks is good policy for two reasons.
8780,Masks do more to protect people when the person who is sick is wearing them and unvaccinated people are the most likely to be sick and transmit disease.
8781,"Secondly, it creates a strong incentive for those not vaccinated to get vaccinated."
8782,"Third, it acts as a visual reminder of who is and isn’t vaccinated which I think is good."
8783,I’m not that worried about it creating divisions.
8784,If someone who is unvaccinated is salty about it that’s on them.
8785,They’re actively choosing the more difficult path and to put others in harm and I think consequences for those actions are good.
8786,I have Generalized Anxiety Disorder and Panic.
8787,I'm definitely not anti-vaxx and was jealous when my mom was able to get Pfizer as early as January.
8788,I've taken the Pandemic seriously and was already social distancing Feb. 2020.
8789,My worries were that the vaccine was developed too fast and that governments were prioritizing the economy over people.
8790,I think everyone had their breaking point with self-isolation and I finally started to work up in the courage in April.
8791,"By that point, I had researched all three vaccines in-depth and decided on Pfizer for the lower chance of side effects."
8792,"I used all the vaccine spotter tools to finally grab an appointment for Pfizer but the day before my first dose, the J&amp;J pause happened and I panicked/canceled."
8793,"In order to combat the anticipatory anxiety, I decided to wait until walk-ins became a thing."
8794,"That way the day I decided I was ready, I could just go do it."
8795,My city organized a giant vaccine drive-thru with all 3 vaccines.
8796,"The day I finally decided I was ready, I drove to the vaccination site and was told they were holding Pfizer back for the kids."
8797,I spent an agonizing 20 minutes in my car trying to decide what to do.
8798,It felt like now or never.
8799,"I knew Moderna had a higher chance of side effects but with my anxiety, with J&amp;J, I probably would have thought every little thing was a blood clot."
8800,So I went with Moderna.
8801,I had a ton of side effects and felt pretty crummy for the first 72 hours.
8802,My arm felt fine the first 4 hours but after that it was very sore and tender.
8803,I had trouble putting shirts on and just exercising my arm was extremely painful.
8804,I was very fatigued.
8805,I had trouble sitting up at my desk and focusing on my work.
8806,I would just lay in bed and listen to podcasts.
8807,I tried going for a walk day 1 and day 2 after the vaccine and nearly fainted each time.
8808,Best way to describe it was like trying to go for a walk with a fever.
8809,Either day 1 or day 2 post vaccine I also woke up with extreme lower back pain.
8810,"I already have a bad back, so it was hard to tell if I slept wrong or if it was the vaccine."
8811,The weird thing about the lower back pain was that it would come and go.
8812,"I saw other people's stories with lower back pain with both Pfizer and Moderna, so I definitely think it was the vaccine."
8813,"Once I regained mobility in my arm, I also noticed armpit tenderness which has been documented and is even in Moderna's FDA briefing."
8814,I'm 9 days post vaccination and feel ~ 95% back to normal.
8815,And wow does it feel like a long 9 days.
8816,"I'm very conflicted on getting the second dose since the first is supposed to be at least 80% effective, which is higher than J&amp;J."
8817,"Everyone says the second dose is worse, so I'm thinking about what I went through times ten."
8818,I'm not writing this to fear monger Moderna.
8819,I'm glad I have at least 1 dose and some protection.
8820,I guess this is my response to all the Moderna (I just had a sore arm) people saying that we are overdoing it.
8821,"If you look at the Moderna clinical trials, 7% decided not to get the second dose for ""unknown reasons""."
8822,And it's actually widely supported by the population.
8823,They're not really in any rush to open the borders.
8824,I'm curious if there is any reason to believe that kids who are susceptible to Kawasaki disease might also be more susceptible MIS-C?
8825,"I know they have distinguished them as separate syndromes, but they are both triggered by viruses and it seems there might still be a question about common genetic predisposition to the immune response in either case?"
8826,"In other words, if a child had KD when they were young, might they also be considered at risk for MIS-C?"
8827,"Yes, we know it’s Facebook."
8828,"It’s the official page and appears to be the only available release, so we’re making an exception."
8829,You love to see it
8830,We have it as well in Canada.
8831,Can’t publicly show a political opinion that could be connected through you to the military.
8832,So it doesn’t preclude from having a political opinion and vote but does from being an active member in political organizations.
8833,Official or otherwise
8834,????
8835,?
8836, I'm trying to point out how the US won't allow the same exports despite demand having competely dried up.
8837,"Only because you signed contracts that suppliers are respecting, with the exception of AZ."
8838,What pretext is there to stop Pfizer from exporting if they’re meeting their contractual obligations with the EU?
8839,And Moderna produces them in Switzerland which is not in the EU anyway.
8840,Stop bragging about private companies.
8841,CO Governor Polis referenced that figure (10%-30%) during his address to the state this week.
8842,Not sure what data the state health dept was using for that statement.
8843,"Laymans news sources reference it here:

[https://www.cnbc.com/2021/02/09/long-haul-covid-symptoms-should-be-a-wake-up-call-for-young-people-texas-childrens-doctor-says.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/02/09/long-haul-covid-symptoms-should-be-a-wake-up-call-for-young-people-texas-childrens-doctor-says.html)

While there are sources that cite +/- 50% figures for pediatric long covid:

[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7927578/](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7927578/)

&gt;Evidence from the first study of long covid in children suggests that more than half of children aged between 6 and 16 years old who contract the virus have at least one symptom lasting more than 120 days, with 42.6 per cent impaired by these symptoms during daily activities."
8844,"bodies like The WHO have been slow to recognize it: [https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2021/03/18/virus-longhaul-coronavirus-children/](https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2021/03/18/virus-longhaul-coronavirus-children/)

(Though to be fair, The WHO is an inherently slow body that took more than a year to recognize COVID as an airborne disease, etc."
8845,I'm not saying it's a bad thing.
8846,"Just a slow, deliberate thing.)"
8847,[removed]
8848,Sent!
8849,Let me know what you think and if you have questions unanswered
8850,"After reading about it more, that's the closest equivalent the US has so it's a pretty fair comparison."
8851,Oh ok. Ive never been to a full blown political rally.
8852,Ah!
8853,"Finally, this makes sense 😂 thanks for the info!"
8854,Very interesting
8855,It only got approved like 2 months ago.
8856,"Remember, it took a while for a lot of real world data to come out from Pfizer, and that was approved 3 months before J&amp;J."
8857,"You have to give enough time for the actual 8 weeks to pass, enough time to see an adequate number of infections, enough time to compile/edit the data, enough time to peer review, and enough time to account for things like the 2 week pause."
8858,"As well, J&amp;J hasn't been used that much."
8859,Under 10 million doses I believe.
8860,The DOJ is an independent agency of the fed.
8861,Are you somehow faulting Biden or Democrats for the DOJ's decision?
8862,Lol.
8863,That'd be great!
8864,"I'm trying to balance a gentle presentation of facts, but not bubble over into hitting that ""Just leave me the hell alone about this"" tipping point of an argument with them."
8865,Any little nuggets I can slip into conversation once a week or so will hopefully help!
8866,"I think the key with the way his mind works, is to find a reputable scientist who had originally raised the alarm on XYZ concern, but has since backpedaled that concern with new easily explainable evidence."
8867,"For example, I think it was helpful in the ""But maybe harm fertility??"""
8868,"controversy to point out that there were indeed similarities between proteins in the placenta and the spike proteins in sarscov2 (validating that he wasn't worried over nothing), but after more careful study they were found to be different enough that the vaccine doesn't attack those proteins."
8869,"And unfortunately low incidence counts from the trials aren't enough to sway, it has to be ""there is 0 chance"" for him to feel okay about it, I think."
8870,"And most scientific language is more like ""We have no reason to believe that X"", instead of ""We are 100% confident that there is 0% chance of X""."
8871,"I'm pulling out my hair, over here."
8872,Lol.
8873,Did I say they weren't selling them?
8874,"I was pointing out how we allow pretty much unrestricted exports, instead of hogging it all while the rest of the world struggles with supply."
8875,I would be interested in this!
8876,"It was a rough comparison, but I think in terms of roles and responsibilities, CAP is a good equivalent."
8877,So far.
8878,We have only had about a week with reduced safety precautions and most indoor businesses still maintain masking requirements.
8879,Give it a couple months.
8880,This doesn't mean a damn thing for the unvaccinated who didn't get Covid.
8881,"You want to be happy, be happy."
8882,"You want to declare ""shows over?"
8883,"Naw, just naw."
8884,It is no worse than the flu for young healthy people.
8885,That's no secret.
8886,"But it is orders of magnitude more deadly for old or immunocompromised people, and if we want to eradicate it we need as many people vaccinated as possible."
8887,"No, the antibodies from covid don't last long enough for it to be detected at this point so I'll never know for sure."
8888,Yep!
8889,My husband and I are constantly having this conversation.
8890,How do we balance what we know about their risk for getting Covid/ having a severe case of Covid and what we don’t know/ are learning about long Covid risks in kids who got mild cases.
8891,If I have any hair at all by the time September rolls around it will be a miracle
8892,"Yeah, and if you really want to know if you had it, can’t you just get an antigen test?"
8893,"Flip flop, flip flop, flip flop"
8894,Nice!
8895,"Look at the whole set of published data regarding specific risks, breakdowns by age, population, country."
8896,There are even recommendations to mitigate risk that have been studied and material regarding things that don't work.
8897,It's almost like... it's a topic that has been studied for a while with concrete information and definitive preventative measures that can be taken to reduce risk so that people can make an informed decision.
8898,"To quote the person you linked that to...

&gt;We are literally still learning about this virus and all the shit it can do to us."
8899,"Yeah, that's really different."
8900,I've been to functions like that as well.
8901,They're not campaign rallies.
8902,And I served during the Bush administration (an administration I'd never vote for).
8903,It wasn't political rallies when he or Cheney came to our posts to give speeches or whatever.
8904,"I've been to a lot of political rallies, and a few of those things, and they're just really different."
8905,Whoops.
8906,That would indeed be the one haha.
8907,"Guilty, as I haven’t seen either show."
8908,"At least where I live (Delhi), the number of SOS calls and overall people around getting sick has lessened too much and hospitals are now available."
8909,April 2nd half was absolute hell.
8910,This exactly.
8911,My Ex’s boyfriend will not get vaccinated because he thinks it’s a hoax.
8912,Even though her got COVID back in November and ended up at the hospital.
8913,And he get them to my kids.
8914,Thankfully they had no symptoms.
8915,"And even my ex, still wants to wait for our 16 year old to get him the vaccine to see how other people react?"
8916,Seriously?
8917,We're not selling them.
8918,"We're allowing them to be exported outside of the EU, unlike other places."
8919,"Actually, there are two subgroups within that too 5-11 and 2-5:

&gt;The study is evaluating the safety, tolerability, and immunogenicity of the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine on a two-dose schedule (approximately 21 days apart) in three age groups: children aged 5 to 11 years, 2 to 5 years, and 6 months to 2 years."
8920,The 5 to 11 year-old cohort started dosing last week and the companies plan to initiate the 2 to 5 year-old cohort next week.
8921,https://www.pfizer.com/news/press-release/press-release-detail/pfizer-biontech-announce-positive-topline-results-pivotal
8922,Good point.
8923,I just wish the discussion surrounding this topic wasn’t heavily censored all last year.
8924,Censoring discourse is never the answer.
8925,That's about as long as we have had covid.
8926,"The fact is, reinfections aren't happening much,  even in people who've had it over a year ago, so it must be enough so fsr."
8927,We're moving my kids 12th birthday from early September to late July this year.
8928,If your 11 year old is close enough think about getting it a little early.
8929,We do not want the stress of starting middle school and worrying about covid.
8930,"I expect there are very very few people that fill this title in the Canadian military, so there would be confusion."
8931,"I could be wrong on this as well, as it appears the rank itself is not technically commissioned."
8932,"Given that charges are going through the military however, that tends to reinforce that yes, he was under military jurisdiction."
8933,I just want that border open.
8934,I was confident in July 1 but now I'm not so sure

8994,"[1][2]""  Note--he was a member of the officer training corps, NOT a cadet himself."
8995,"Technically, it IS an officer rank, but ranking below the normal officer ranks (even 2nd Lt)."
8996,we're now in the bottom of the 9th!
8997,All we have to do from here on out is to continue targeting vaccinations to specific communities and regions where there's hesitancy or reluctance.
8998,I would even be okay with giving all those holdouts a Vaccine Stimulus check so we can hit 80% before winter.
8999,I signed myself up for a vaccine trial very early in the phase 3 trials.
9000,I am a nurse and I did a LOT of research before signing up.
9001,I read pretty much every single publication and expert opinion that was available at the time.

9008,"Yeah, it’s like the reporters haven’t realized that their reporting can literally kill or help Americans people never remember the resolution 4 weeks later."
9009,It’s a pretty heavy responsibility that unfortunately coincides with the arise of the need for clicks and views for relevance and revenue.
9010,"This is very good news for vaccine adoption world wide, good job Saudi Arabia"
9011,This is amazing news because a lot of people will never get vaccinated.
9012,It seems they won't hold us back too far.

9015,"I've never heard of this, but in terms of Canadian rank, it is a ""subordinate officer"" rank of ""Officer Cadet (OCdt)"" that ranks below a Second Lieutenant, but above warrant officers."
9016,At least that is how I interpret the miltary rank page:  https://www.canada.ca/en/services/defence/caf/military-identity-system/rank-appointment-insignia.html
9017,I apologize.

9020,"In addition to him speaking out against the vaccine, his supporters are creating a GoFundMe for legal expenses when he already has the right to a free defense lawyer provided by the military."
9021,"Not only do these people not understand how medicine works, they also don't understand how the law works."
9022,At least the money they give to the GoFundMe won't be spent on other crazy stuff.
9023,Human manipulation is not required for the lab leak hypothesis to be true.
9024,[SARS-CoV-2 infection induces long-lived bone marrow plasma cells in humans](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-021-03647-4)
9025,Only 4 cases in the placebo group vs 0 in the vaccinated group (1:2 ratio in number of participants in each group).
9026,Really irresponsible to claim 100% effectiveness when obviously the error bars mean that the true effectiveness has a lot of uncertainty to it.
9027,"Feels like they should have had a much larger number of participants enrolled, but maybe they didn't expect the covid case rate to fall so much over the past few months."
9028,"Totally, nothing anti vax about being extra cautious with your children."
9029,"Personally if I had children, I wouldn’t vaccinate them (unless they had a health condition) until everything was fully FDA approved and trials with kids their age have been ongoing for an extended period of time."
9030,I say this and am already fully vaccinated.
9031,"Kids are extremely low risk and I would want to make sure they went above and beyond normal due diligence before giving to to mine, especially a baby."
9032,"Vaccine aside, this is literally mutiny."

9040,The Cadets organization is funded by the Dept.
9041,"Of National Defence in Canada, to be an instructor, you must go through some military training and follow the armed forces' code of conduct."
9042,I've even got an older family member who posts anti-vax stuff on Facebook but was vaccinated the minute he was eligible.
9043,"Which is dumb, but at least he's vaccinated."
9044,It's also about testing variables.
9045,During a full trial period they likely would have done studies to determine optimal dosing schedule and maybe even dose amounts to optimize everything.
9046,We didn't have time for that so they picked one of each they thought would work and went with it.
9047,They would have also done all the trial phases sequentially instead of in parallel.
9048,"Basically, they got all the basic data needed for a trial, except for long term data, which is partially why it's an EUA and not full."
9049,Trump is too selfish and stupid to treat lb leak with the proper respect it needed.
9050,He clamored for any explanation that would deflect blame from his own incompetence.
9051,&gt; Not even one of them yet.
9052,"He's a cadet officer, not an officer cadet."
9053,If he was the second he would be training to become an officer.
9054,"What he is is an ""officer"" who trains cadets, 12-18 year-olds in what amounts to a semi-militarized boy scout troop."
9055,He is technically a soldier but he's about as far down the list of military as you can go.
9056,"Representing himself as anything military is cringey in the least, and a statement about the professionalism of cadet officers."
9057,"Yo, I don't know what's up with that dude up there."
9058,"Guess he's never served alongside a reservist, because no one I was ever around in my years of active duty talked shit to reservists."
9059,"""Weekend Warriors,"" sure, but that was typically a term of endearment, not derogatory."
9060,Currently a TR and that's a term we use to describe ourselves.
9061,"But ""part time patriot?"""
9062,"Never heard it used before, but, yeah... there's plenty of ""part time"" shit on active duty."
9063,Lot of jobs out there where you ain't doing much.
9064,"The role is still in the military, under their reserve force, and as such would still be subject to military law: ""The Cadet Instructors Cadre is part of the Cadet Organizations Administration and Training Service, a sub-component of the Reserve Force"""

9092,There's also a large difference in health care availability.
9093,We saw an IFR of well over 1% in NYC (median age 36) when healthcare was moderately strained.
9094,Yet they're using 0.15%-0.4% for all of India (median age 26 and probably matching NYC's quality of care in the best case).

9160,Jena Powell is one of those Republican contrarians against Ohio's vaccine incentive.
9161,It's such a short-sighted view.
9162,These incentives are a very small cost that will result in a huge benefit in being able to get back to normal sooner.
9163,I took Ibuprofen(200mg Advil) a few hours after my First Pfizer (say 6-7 hours) to combat a headache and around 24 hours after my second dose to combat severe bodyaches and chills.
9164,"Im reading that it's not advised to take it after at all even though the nurse said I could take advil:(  
Can someone help me out here?"
9165,Im feeling anxious that I messed up my vaccination.
9166,Don't underestimate the dedication of an indoctrinated cult member.
9167,Over 60% already have 1 dose.
9168,Why would you think 50% fully vaccinated is the limit?
9169,I’d imagine most people will get their second dose.
9170,Clinical trials are being conducted now  on kids 6 months to 11 years.
9171,They should be completed by sometime this fall.
9172,I don't see why we can't commit to protecting them until they have a chance to take the vaccine.
9173,It isn't forever.
9174,I am glad someone is doing some math here.
9175,They are claiming anywhere from 600k to 1.6mil dead.

9180,It's not independent for all other functions of the DOJ where it's guided by the administration's needs.
9181,Why is the appearance of neutrality needed for the most corrupt administration in recent history?
9182,Why does Trump deserve that lowered standard for himself while everyday people don't get that benefit of the doubt?
9183,Finally... Do you really think they're not going to let him off easy?
9184,That's really the most important question you're avoiding.
9185,Well... that’s a logical fallacy if I ever did see one.
9186,I said this in one of these threads before...
9187,"If you don't want to get vaxxed, at least a LITTLE understandable."
9188,Some bodies can't handle that and it is a new vaccine from companies.
9189,But DO NOT say i don't want to get vaxxes i also don't want to wear masks i also don't want to isolate or wnat anything to close because at that point you are pro covid

9294,Kids need to be able to see each other's facial expressions to learn how to be social.
9295,Masking them up for years during the most critical years of social development is going to negatively affect them.
9296,Not to mention those of us who have small kids and thus have to stay home until they can be vaccinated means that’s still a chunk of the population having less engagement in the economy.

9341,Because they believe Dr. Facebook more than Dr. Fauci.
9342,"The CDC data probably is by day of death, as you say."
9343,But that means that deaths from the last two weeks would be incomplete and would always show an artificial decline.

9386,"&gt; The researcher at Unesp of Botucatu and vice president of the Brazilian Society of Virology, João Pessoa Araújo Júnior, announced on Tuesday (25) the identification of a new variant of the new coronavirus, the P.4."
9387,"&gt; According to the specialist, the origin is still unknown, but it was first identified in Mococa, in the interior of Sao Paulo, and has high circulation in Porto Ferreira."
9388,&gt; It is not yet possible to know if the variant is more contagious or dangerous than the 'common' virus.
9389,"&gt; New variant
&gt; Earlier this month, the L452R mutation in the S protein, which is also present in the Indian variant of the new coronavirus, was identified in samples from Descalvado and Porto Ferreira."
9390,"However, it was still not possible to say whether it was a new variant or an existing one."
9391,"&gt; According to the researcher, the analyses of the university were submitted to the Global Initiative on Sharing All Influenza Data (GISAID), an international initiative of open access to information on genomes of influenza viruses and coronaviruses."
9392,The group then made the designation of the name P.4.
9393,"&gt; ""This new variant is a relative of P.1, because it has the same origin, the origin is B.1.1.28, which is a lineage that gave rise to P.1, P.2, which was identified in Rio de Janeiro, P.3, which was identified in the Philippines."
9394,"And now P.4 has been identified, which origin is still unknown, but it was first recognized in eastern Sao Paulo, first in Mococa, then we saw a high frequency of it in the city of Porto Ferreira, where we concentrated our study,"" said the researcher."
9395,"&gt; Also according to Araújo Júnior, the recognition of the new variant is important, as it shows that it is on the rise."
9396,There is still no information about the behaviour of the variant.
9397,"&gt; ""It is in an environment where P.1 predominates, where the British variant predominates as well, but it is rising with a frequency that worries us a lot."
9398,"So, this was recognized by GISAID and now, with this name, we will be able to better monitor how it will spread and we almost beg the competent health bodies to look more carefully for this region, so we can minimize the transmission of this variant P.4 to other regions, as happened with the variant P.1, ""said the researcher."
9399,"&gt; With the presence of the researcher, the City of Porto Ferreira will make a live on Facebook this Tuesday, at 5 pm, to clarify information about the new variant."
9400,"There are definitely some kids at higher risk of covid, even if 99.5% aren't."
9401,I'm hoping enough vaccinated adults would mean even those kids are protected.
9402,China is still pushing hard for their two home grown vaccines.
9403,Problem is a lot of people do not trust them.
9404,"&gt;""This is a major milestone in our country's vaccination efforts,"" Andy Slavitt, a White House senior adviser on the COVID-19 response, said during a midday briefing."
9405,"Nearly 130 million people age 18 and older have completed their vaccine regimens since the first doses were administered to the public in December, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said."
9406,"Mike DeWine has unlocked a secret,"" Slavitt said, noting that Ohio's vaccination rate went up 55% among young adults in the days after unveiling the program."

9443,If they're all fully vaccinated I don't understand what the issue is.
9444,Michigan should be allowing fully vaccinated people to be dining together.
9445,I don't think 70% is a very nebulous goal.
9446,It's pretty specific.
9447,I get that some states are never going to hit that because...I mean...you know why.
9448,"In those states, it might be reasonable to base decisions on numbers of new cases and set a target that indicated that the circulating pool of covid was low enough to present less of a risk."
9449,Obviously states in general need to do what is appropriate based on their numbers of deaths/new cases/vaccination rates.
9450,"It's just been frustrating to see states like mine (that at the time of the CDC announcement had new cases numbers that were above the national average and increasing and had a full vaccination rate hovering around 35%) say ""Woohoo!"
9451,"Problem solved!"""
9452,and abandon mask mandates.
9453,"Our new case numbers that week were as high as they were last November when everybody was wringing their hands and saying ""Something must be done about these alarming numbers!"""
9454,"It's not just my state doing that, either, and honestly, I don't understand."

9456,thanks grandma
9457,"I suggest you read up on how ""exponential growth"" and it's cousin ""exponential decay"" work."
9458,"I mean, you can't really compare vaccinating 1% of canada a day vs 1% of China per day, since the vaccine number is like 50 times difference."
9459,"&gt; You are also going to have to explain why symptoms like fatigue, headache, or lack of sense of smell should be included into that 2.3% (dysopnea seems to be the only significant symptom listed in the study warranting immediate medical care)."
9460,"Of the symptoms we understand well, it is the fatigue and inability to focus that are my primary concerns."
9461,"In the early years of their lives, kids are constantly learning, even before they start school."
9462,An inability to focus or fatigue lasting several months could significantly delay the development of younger kids.
9463,"Looking across the whole population, if we see COVID-19 continuing to spread among children we could see a generation of children with significant developmental delays."
9464,Does that risk justify requiring masks in all public places?
9465,"Maybe not, as there are some businesses where they are very impractical and where kids do not frequently go, like gyms."
9466,"However, there are plenty of venues where masks do not seriously hinder anyone and where families frequently gather."
9467,Places like movie theaters and grocery stores.
9468,"I think it is a mistake to not require them in those locations, at least until young children have the opportunity to be vaccinated."

9493,"Probably because ""full FDA approval"" is a silly benchmark; as others have mentioned, EUA already implies it is safe, and that full approval is more about long term efficacy."
9494,Yeah the US is in exponential decay in case numbers.
9495,2/3 adults partially vaccinated and then another 30-40% of Americans having recovered potentially.
9496,"Then you have a huge swath of Americans living in rural communities where covid is basically no longer present, and there is a 2/3 chance that anyone coming in from out of town will be at least partially vaccinated."
9497,I find it hard to argue for strict regulations when cases are falling though.

9566,"It took a reworking of the underlying physics of aerosols and a heaping dose of novel epidemiology... the virus clearly behaves different than some other respiratory viruses, and it took some science to get there."
9567,"But to all the people who are saying ""I knew it the whole time, it was so obvious."""
9568,Congrats - you took a guess and got lucky.
9569,Fortunately for us that's not rigorous science.
9570,"Fully vaccinated with Pfizer now, but I was originally looking for J&amp;J because my life was complete chaos and the idea of having to schedule a second shot when I had no idea what my life would look like from one day to the next was paralyzing."
9571,"I wanted the vaccine, but since I historically have awful reactions to everything from Novocain to MMR boosters, it felt like the ultimate disloyalty to myself to potentially have a bad reaction when I needed to be at my best."
9572,I was stressed and exhausted and just terrified of doing anything to make it worse.
9573,And then the universe forgot to keep kicking me in the face for a minute and I made an appointment for an mRNA vaccine!
9574,"And I didn't even have a bad reaction - I felt garbagey the next day, but nothing like the high fevers and bodyaches I get from everything else (I have a sensitivity to some preservatives.)"
9575,"I am so relieved to have the Pfizer and to be fully vaccinated, but when I felt kind of pinned down by life, J&amp;J looked like my best option to protect myself and not complicate my life even more."
9576,"2-11 y/o will get the approval by year end on the US, for your newborn doubt it'll be any time soon"
9577,Not at all.
9578,Whatever makes one feel happy and safe
9579,I wonder about asymptomatic cases
9580,Hold us back?
9581,They were technically ahead of us.
9582,Having had it twice would make one think there's not too many antibodies produced for some people.
9583,"The GDPR exemption's are
-Personal or household activities

And if you're creative enough you just say, there is a pandamic and in the intrest of the national security I don't have to inform you."
9584,Only if you are against anyone else wearing a mask.
9585,I guess to block those not vaccinated or previously infected.
9586,I thought Israel's vaccine program was to include vaccinated AND previously infected and treated them the same.
9587,"I didnt get lucky with Sam Adam's or Budweiser either, I got a few free donuts, though, and I should get entered in a lottery in the coming weeks when my state irons it out."
9588,And I got entered for some free flights.
9589,"Plenty of ""free shit"" for those who were on it, and this is one of them, so lord knows why you decided to say ""fuck me."""
9590,"Actually, everyone knows why."
9591,It's because reading an article before commenting is too hard for some.
9592,Thats very good news
9593,"That's disingenuous to suggest that people are lazy, rather than that there are no tests to take."
9594,&gt; Australia is currently in a very vulnerable position with virtually no immunity in the population either from vaccines or from having had the disease.
9595,"And to make matters worse, the strains dominating these days are more dangerous to a population with low immunity than the original one from a year ago."

9759,"The point was it's expected for antibodies to fall to low levels, but the body retains the ability to ramp production of those antibodies up at a later time."
9760,"And in 79% of the people they looked at, they found these antibody-producing cells in their blood marrow."

9771,"Dude, why is it so hard for people like you to admit NZ &amp; Australia fucked up their vaccine procurements?"
9772,It's a completely undeniable fact.
9773,"No one is denying both countries handled brilliantly the pandemic and saved a lot of lives with their strategy compared to Europe or the US, but they've been completely incompetent at securing doses in time and organising a mass vaccine roll out."
9774,"That's it, period."
9775,Just like the UK did the opposite and fucked up their handling of the pandemic and did brilliantly with their vaccine roll out.
9776,Not as insane as the increasing number of idiots I see refusing to get a vaccine.... or even crazier the idiots who think the vaccines make you contagious with...

9788,I mean I knew the daily cases were calming down in recent weeks but I never thought it would hit the 50% mark until perhaps later in the summer.
9789,I have no idea how vaccine certificates work in the EU but here in the US it's literally a printed notecard and someone writes in the name of the vaccine you got and batch number as well as your name.
9790,"There are no signatures on the card, nor are there any anti-piracy features."
9791,You could print this up on your home computer in a bout 10 seconds if you had card stock that you could buy at Wal-mart or any office supply store.
9792,"I've heard anecdotal stories of people who got vaccine cards that weren't even card stock, they were just regular old 8x10 paper."
9793,Absurdly easy to forge if you were so inclined to do so.
9794,Aren't they exactly the same thing or is that part of the joke?
9795,Let them know what?
9796,"They already know that it happens with other viruses too, which is why they are using extremely moderated language without any histrionics around it."
9797,"""Although most children with COVID-19 do not have severe disease, our study shows that there may be other effects of SARS-CoV-2 that are worthy of investigation""."
9798,That language is as about as milquetoast and panic-free as it can be for a scientist or a doctor.
9799,Do you even know what you're arguing about anymore?
9800,Are you in k-12.
9801,If so sorry if you gotta deal with that.
9802,I have been saying that I had to have had the virus back in October of 2019.
9803,I came down horribly sick and had trouble breathing and lungs felt like they were on fire.
9804,I had loss of taste and smell and everyday I coughed up large chunks of phlegm.
9805,I had every test done and no one could diagnose what I had.
9806,My doctor just put down bronchitis.
9807,Ever since then I have to use a maintenance inhaler just to breath properly.
9808,"I'm convinced I had the virus back then, although some here in the US won't believe me because the first documented case was in December earliest."
9809,I've been saying it's possible it's been here longer then we really know and China not telling the world about it.

9830,Not anyone — only people 12 and over.
9831,Which is why this article is about how people under 12 are being punished by antivaxxers and vaccinated people too impatient for comfortable faces.

9843,"But, the mRNA vaccine isn’t virus based and doesn’t contain virus particles, which is what makes it different."
9844,So is it the adjuvants causing the myocarditis or the spike protein fragments?
9845,&gt; But yeah the parents should literally have no rights.
9846,Their kids should be able to get emancipation.
9847,I think we'll have to agree to disagree on this.
9848,I have particularly strong feelings on the direction you would want to take this.
9849,We did have a child go down the road of emancipation for all the wrong reasons (as in: they don't let me just do whatever the f*k I want) and even tried to get us in trouble with CPS by claiming abuse (which wasn't true) and of course that went no where.
9850,I take his current occupation of a jail cell to be evidence enough that the child does not always know best.
9851,"&gt; Fuck, the kids should be allowed to sue for alimony."
9852,...
9853,"If parents are endangering their kids like that, they should have their wages garnished and given to the kids for the rest of their lives."
9854,And this... what you're suggesting here is to build a system whereby children could simply claim lifelong support from a parent and never achieve any sort of independence of their own.
9855,"Parental abuse happens and should be dealt with of course, but a child needs to own their fate at some point and start taking responsibility."
9856,"Without that, an unhappy lifetime of failure will result; and I've seen more than enough examples of that to be very sure of it."
9857,"&gt;deserves to die

Only you said that, troll."
9858,Are the Olympics still on?
9859,Bad news sells
9860,The other half got COVID this winter.
9861,Holy fuck that was a scary time.
9862,o
9863,You’re the only one I see saying that.
9864,In fact you’re the one here doing exactly what you’re saying.
9865,We’re saying that we don’t know and it could possibly be from a lab and you’re screeching about how that idea is a conspiracy and people are crazy for thinking that when it’s a completely logical and realistic possibility.
9866,You realize this is the military right?
9867,He's refusing a lawful order to do his duty and inciting others to do the same.
9868,It's basically the definition of mutiny.
9869,Do you have a link to an article about this change for camps specifically?
9870,"Haven’t heard anything yet, I’m from NY"
9871,"I Would be vaccinated by now if my local doctors where not being so unreasonable 

Oh well"
9872,No one said he deserves to die.
9873,Fucking idiotic strawman
9874,"~~2 weeks~~  
~~We have to wait until hospitals aren't overwhelmed~~  
~~We have to wait until the most vulnerable have access to the vaccine~~  
~~We have to wait until everyone who wants the shot can get it~~  
~~OMG variants~~  
~~We have to wait until case and death numbers are dropping~~  
~~OMG more variants~~  
But the kids and immunocompromised!"
9875,"**&lt;&lt;&lt;---- You Are Here**  
We have to wait until we reach herd immunity  
We have to wait until there are zero Covid cases  
Masks forever just in case of a variant"
9876,More or less.
9877,Divergence in test and placebo groups happened around days 12-15 in both phase 3 trials.
9878,Here are the studies; Figure 3 in each outlines the prevalence of infection between test and placebo groups: [Pfizer](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/nejmoa2034577); [Moderna](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/nejmoa2035389).
9879,We also don’t have enough evidence to say for sure that Bigfoot didn’t engineer the virus in the Pacific Northwest to kill humanity.
9880,"It’s not likely, but ..."
9881,"&gt;It gives the message of "" if you don't Xxxxx, you will .... "" It's a threat to obey and do the right-think."
9882,'The enemy forces are closing up on our capital.
9883,"Colonel, use your regiment to attempt a delaying action on their right flank, we need to give our civilians more time to ecacuate.'"
9884,"To which the colonel goes to his comms station and proclaims to anyone who is listening:

'I’m asking military, right now serving, truck drivers, medical, engineers, whatever you are, do not take this unlawful order for preparing a delaying action.'"
9885,And what do you expect the military to do?
9886,Shrug it off or charge the man with mutiny?
9887,"Not surprising it was JBS, we had a big outbreak in Cache Valley, Utah at a JBS plant."
9888,You mean Arrested Development?
9889,Which is bonkers because Marx doesn’t have much to say about race.
9890,"Can you please let those doctors know then, random internet commenter."
9891,Some people I’ve spoken to say they fear it will alter their DNA.
9892,"Every time I tried to give a good counter argument, they would eventually go and I assume talk it over with other people."
9893,Then repeat the same thing next week.
9894,"The majority ended up just getting Pfizer, but at least one is still holding out."
9895,"And they are terrified of getting the virus, so I really don’t know what to say anymore."

9898,ehhhh... i have to disagree.

9901,You have to be much more cautious when testing in children.
9902,Since their bodies change pretty rapidly things could affect them that don’t affect slightly older children.
9903,"A pretty clear line is pre-pubescent and post-pubescent, hence this 12-year-old cutoff"
9904,Lol
9905,You're lucky to live in a state where the unions aren't omnipotent.
9906,I'd love to trade places with you any time.
9907,Heaven is where things go when they did.
9908,"We wouldn’t worry about it then, right?"
9909,"You are harming your child through your actions, and will cause long lasting damage to their development."
9910,Go for it.

9913,The sore arm seems to be the one common denominator across everyone’s shots!
9914,"That’s cool though man, thanks for sharing."
9915,Glad it passed without much of an issue for you!
9916,"I use google, just search “va covid cases” and the first thing that comes up is a chart of the cases, I think 654 is from yesterday?"
9917,Maybe the 76 cases was from Sunday?
9918,My bad!
9919,Either way still asking the same general question.
9920,Kinda bummed now tho seeing the 600 number..
9921,"Just curious, what part of the change in policy were you most interested in?"
9922,Being able to go without a mask at work or the sticker that people would wear?
9923,"I'm vaccinated and thankfully fully remote now, and I would hate to have to wear a mask at work if I were in an office."
9924,But people wearing a sticker seems awkward to me and might create office division that just isn't needed.
9925,"Not on your device but the device that's reading the QR and requesting the information, you have no control over that device."

9927,The rate of death and complications is indeed lower than the flu.
9928,Of course the manically terrified here don't even want to hear about that.
9929,Its also powerfully effective in adults.
9930,What’s stopping you?
9931,Absolutely wrong.
9932,Stop making shit up.
9933,The flu vaccine protects immunocompromised against hospitalization at about 1/8th the rate of the average adult.
9934,That's actually much worse than initial data for the Covid vaccine.
9935,"[https://www.healio.com/news/infectious-disease/20210115/flu-vaccine-effectiveness-low-among-immunocompromised-patients](https://www.healio.com/news/infectious-disease/20210115/flu-vaccine-effectiveness-low-among-immunocompromised-patients)

VE among immunocompromised vs. nonimmunocompromised adults was lower at **5%** (–29% to 31%) vs. **41%** (27% to 52%) (P &lt; .05 for interaction term)."
9936,You're right.
9937,We *will* have to wear masks.
9938,It's a *fact!
9939,* I'm going to be strong and try not to let that bog me down next year.
