**What we know about AY.4.2, a delta subvariant that's spiking cases in the U.K.**  
Matt Dunham/Associated Press  
The delta variant is still the overwhelmingly dominant coronavirus strain in California and the U.S., but one of its descendants is starting to gain traction overseas."
224,"Known as AY.4.2, it‚Äôs on the rise in the United Kingdom."
225,"Dr. Scott Gottlieb, former U.S. Food and Drug Administration commissioner, in a tweet Sunday noted that it now accounts for 8% of sequenced coronavirus cases in that country and said ‚Äúurgent research‚Äù is needed."
226,"‚ÄúThere‚Äôs no clear indication that it‚Äôs considerably more transmissible, but we should work to more quickly characterize these and other new variants,‚Äù he said."
227,"He and other experts, including in the Bay Area, are keeping an eye on AY.4.2 ‚Äî an offshoot of AY.4, which itself is an offshoot of the main ‚Äúparent‚Äù delta variant."
228,"As the virus makes copies of itself, some small mistakes happen that lead to slight variations, which result in sublineages, said UCSF infectious disease expert Peter Chin-Hong."
229,"According to variant tracker outbreak.info, the delta variant now has 55 sublineages, including AY.4.2."
230,"In recent days, AY.4.2 has been ‚Äúalmost coming up from nowhere,‚Äù said Chin-Hong in an email."
231,"While only a handful of cases have occurred in the U.S. so far, it is something to watch, he said."
232,"Coronavirus Variants  
Is the R.1 variant in the Bay Area?"
233,"What to know about the highly mutated COVID strain  
Is the mu variant in California?"
234,"What to know about the new WHO 'variant of interest'  
‚ÄúThe tempo is the only thing we have going for AY.4.2 at this moment,‚Äù‚Äô he said."
235,"‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt have as much biological plausibility that it will do much damage.‚Äù  
According to outbreak.info, seven AY.4.2 cases have been sequenced in the U.S. ‚Äî one of them in California, in San Diego County."
236,"The others have occurred in Washington, D.C., Oregon, North Carolina and Washington state."
237,"While AY.4.2 isn't a concern yet in the U.S., Chin-Hong said that ‚Äúas long as there are unvaccinated people, the virus will evolve and we need to be vigilant and track all of these variants and sublineages.‚Äù  
The delta sublineage is expanding in the U.K., according to the country‚Äôs Health Security Agency, accounting for 14,705 sequences ‚Äî about 7% to 8% of new sequenced cases there."
238,"It contains two major mutations, A222V and Y145H, in the spike protein, and is among the variants being monitored by the agency."
239,"In a series of tweets Friday, Francois Balloux, director of the UCL Genetics Institute in London, said that the most common delta sublineage is now AY.4, accounting for approximately 70% of all COVID-19 genomes sequenced across the globe."
240,"He said the AY.4.2 sublineage currently appears mostly confined to the U.K. and ‚Äúremains exceptionally rare anywhere else.‚Äù  
While it‚Äôs not an ‚Äúobvious‚Äù candidate for the designation variant of concern, indicating greater transmissibility or the ability to escape the immune system, he said ‚Äúit feels worthwhile keeping an eye on it.‚Äù  
Chin-Hong also said that experts don‚Äôt think AY.4.2 ‚Äúwill be stickier and more transmissible, make vaccines or monoclonal antibodies work less well, or cause people to become more sick.‚Äù  
That‚Äôs because of the way spike proteins work, he said."
241,"They enable a virus to latch onto a human cell and gain entry ‚Äî but AY.4.2‚Äôs two major spike protein mutations aren‚Äôt in the place where the virus binds to the receptor, he said."
242,"Chin-Hong said no other variants are currently causing particular concern, but added, ‚ÄúThere is a new variant being created every two weeks‚Äù and time will tell if another delta-like variant emerges."
243,"And the U.S. opening travel to vaccinated foreign travelers starting Nov. 8 can bring the risk of new variants and sublineages, as fully vaccinated people are still able to harbor the coronavirus, he said."
244,"‚ÄúThe virus continues to shape-shift,‚Äù Chin-Hong said."
245,‚ÄúThe virus variants that seem to have an advantage are those that prize increased transmissibility over vaccine evasion.
246,"They seem to be fitter on the battleground.‚Äù  
He said the Bay Area‚Äôs high vaccination rates have helped keep the recent surge of cases lower, and we have a ‚Äúlarge immunity force field that will at least keep us at bay for a few months, if not longer.‚Äù

251,I think about it like this - imagine that a group of cavemen begin to realize that sabertooth tigers have entered their isolated valley and taken up residence.
252,Every week another member of the tribe is ripped apart and eaten by the tigers.
253,"The decision is made by the cavemen to always carry spears, always travel in war parties, and that children should never leave the safety of the caves and close by them."
254,Everyone has to be on alert for tigers.
255,"Nobody likes this - they want to go frolic in the jungle like they used to, swim in the river, and pick berries and gather fruits on their own freely."
256,"Some do, and some of them get ripped apart screaming and then they get eaten."
257,"The cavemen obey the new rules, but they are angry at having to."
258,"""How long to you keep this up for?"""
259,many of the tribespeople argue.
260,"The answer, of course, is until the sabertooth tigers leave, die out, are killed off, or can be driven away."
261,The answer is: as long as it takes.
262,Because it is stupid to try to pretend the tigers aren't out there.
263,"Because it is stupid to try to pretend covid won't kill people - maybe even you someday, after perhaps your fifth or sixth reinfection."
264,"You keep it all up - the distancing, the masks, the vaccinations and boosters, until covid is somehow ended and is no longer a threat."
265,"""But I can't live like that!"""
266,Covid is more than willing to oblige that sentiment.

288,This one was exciting in that it only needed to be taken twice a day instead of eight times a day.
289,"Sadly, it trailed Merck's drug in efficacy every step of the way."
290,The death rates in the vaccinated cohort are typically higher in age.
291,I'm not attempting to make a comparison to unvaccinated.
292,"It's something like: 

* elderly are some of the most vulnerable to COVID, 
* large % of elderly get vaccinated, 
* so breakthroughs occur in a population that's already vulnerable, 
* so case fatality ratio is high in this group."
293,If you see a claim that high percentages of vaccinated are dying this is precisely why.
294,It's also counter-balanced by a large percentage of young unvaccinated people getting COVID and recovering just fine.
295,So it's weighted on both ends.

297,Also precedent.
298,*Jacobson v. Massachusetts* 1905.
299,"Jacobson v. Massachusetts, 197 U.S. 11 (1905), was a United States Supreme Court case in which the Court upheld the authority of states to enforce compulsory vaccination laws."
300,The Court's decision articulated the view that individual liberty is not absolute and is subject to the police power of the state.

304,Fair point.
305,Long-COVID is a whole different thing and that's outside of the research I've been doing.
306,It's certainly a risk but I have no way of knowing how to quantify it.
307,"It's something like a string of 4 or 5 probabilities, risk getting lower with each multiplication."
308,\[Probability of Exposure\] X \[Probability of Infection\] X \[Probability of passing beyond innate immunity\] X \[Probability of moderate or severe illness\] X \[Probability of lasting effects\]

312,I've sometimes had to cut down on how much I wash my hands or reduce how often I use some to protect my hands (they get to the point that they bleed from drying out).
313,"I can do things like try to put on lotion after each time I wash my hands, or even do it multiple times after but it simply cannot make up for the damage soap does to my sensitive skin."
314,"And speaking of putting hands near my mouth, I do that quite often in the process of trying to undo the dryness of my lips."
315,Definitely wouldn't consider adding more hand-washing.

317,"If you choose a good rate, absolutely."
318,"True, but when we likely need 90% of total population fully vaccinated to reach some level of herd immunity against the current varient, reporting a number like 85% when the relevant number is 60% is dangerously misleading."
319,And we weeded out the top 3% of medical care workers that are most likely to kill you with malpractice and lack of medical knowledge.
320,"Well that‚Äôs great, considering that age range was already very unlikely to end up in the hospital to begin with statistically."

322,It's all about mentality.
323,"It will be really hard for people to treat a COVID spike like a flu wave, even if there are vaccines 

Plus the precedent is there and the rules are in place, I see them sticking around for quite a while"
324,Who would want to reproduce with anti-vax degenerates anyways?
325,Let them self-select
326,What if you get Covid after both doses?
327,How immune am I now?
328,Yet people think vaccines and social distancing doesn't work.

333,This is not true.

340,My girlfriend asked me to wear a mask in the house at home.
341,How long should i do this... And what do you suggest as a protocol ?
342,I'm vaccinated and have the booster last thursday
343,Higher population means less susceptible to random noise for a given rate of infections.
344,"With the population of DC, for example, day-to-day fluctuations can affect the 7-day average, leading to a bumpy graph, so you could get some brief dips artificially (which they've had a few days where the 7-day average spiked up or down like 50% in a day)."
345,"OTOH, Wisconsin with its higher case numbers isn't nearly as bumpy as DC despite a slightly smaller population."

347,Are they still able to impose mandates of various sorts without the state of emergency?
348,[removed]
349,"But you even with that normalisation, you wouldn't expect the largest state to be an outlier simply because the bigger the sample, the more diversity it's likely to contain, which likely cancels out extremes when averaged."
350,"Throughout the pandemic, the states that have been doing great have mostly been small states."
351,"Both big and small states have been at the top of the doing worst list, because contagion makes it very easy to have things get really had."
352,"But doing well takes coordination and compliance that is hard, especially at a big scale."
353,"It's more impressive to bring /100k numbers down in a population of 39,000,000 than in a place with 10% or 3% as many people."
354,"Another way of looking at it, if you average together enough of the next best states' numbers to get a similar population, the whole group's average won't be as good as the best state's within that group."
355,Scientists have been saying for a while that Covid will become endemic.
356,The pandemic ends when the number of people dying becomes manageable.
357,Then it will just be a disease we get vaccinated for periodically but still catch from time to time.
358,Which will suck but will very rarely be deadly because of our previous vaccinations/infections.
359,And somebody will say ‚Äúhey why you were out of work last week‚Äù and you‚Äôll say ‚ÄúI caught Covid unfortunately and was down for 5 days.‚Äù And it will be no big deal for most people.

372,Not that I disagree.
373,Unvaccinated is unsexy.
374,"However, Ravi Gupta, a professor of clinical microbiology at the University of Cambridge, told the Guardian these mutations were not of particular concern."

379,My point was that the videos being circulated in the US are painting the entire country as living in some dystopian dictatorship where police bash citizens and ‚Äúpeaceful protesters‚Äù and arrest them for not wearing masks etc.
380,Has anyone else noticed that a lot of these posts are being labeled with the talking points anti-vaxxers are using to make this mandate seem worse.

388,Do we call the annual flu season a pandemic?
389,No.

391,And over time the deadliness will be manageable because we‚Äôll all have been exposed to it enough through vaccination and natural infection.
392,These senators are trying to ‚Äúbar businesses from requiring that their employees get coronavirus vaccinations‚Äù.
393,"I‚Äôm an RN and I have had to keep up-to-date on all my vaccines, I‚Äôve had mandatory flu shots every year for 20 years and a mandatory TB skin test every 6 months - all to keep my patients safe."
394,"That is part of the duty of anyone who cares for others, when you deal with the most at-risk and vulnerable people, you have to keep them safe from you."
395,People should never have to risk their health when seeking healthcare.
396,"Therefore, businesses like hospitals and other healthcare organizations (doctors offices, outpatient surgery centers, laboratories and other diagnostic testing, etc) should NEVER be barred from mandating vaccines."
397,You are essentially barring them from protecting their patients.
398,That what the booster shots are for.
399,"Also,, let's not use the morons terminology by calling it the jab."
400,"&gt; short surges are frequent, while one long surge prevents further surges

I honestly don't understand what point you are trying to make here."
401,You think its even possible that other states with higher vaccine rates like California are going to have more deaths per capita than Florida?
402,"There is no statistical or humanitarian way to think that ""doing nothing"" could still possibly be the best course of action here."
403,"Yup, I wish people wouldn‚Äôt post misinformation like that."
404,Covid is a coronavirus and flu is not.
405,And as you said Covid does not mutate nearly as much as flu.
406,"&gt; From what the data seems to be showing, some in the most vulnerable populations (elderly, folks with severe underlying conditions, etc.)"
407,remain vulnerable even after vaccination.
408,Even after the booster as well?
409,"Is this more like, technically they remain *more* vulnerable than the non vulnerable but not significantly?"
410,Lying about having a vaccine to a highly contagious and deadly virus requires real consequences and is not at all extreme.
411,People have just normalized being willing murderers.
412,You seem to be disputing it.
413,"You've responded to multiple people who pointed out that California has a rate of 60% fully vaccinated (which is the % of total population rather than of eligible pop), with ""this website says 72.1% are fully vaccinated."""
414,You are correcting people with a number that is measuring a different thing.
415,Honestly I plan on wearing masks in the winter anyway.
416,My face gets cold and the mask is more comfortable!
417,doesn‚Äôt Florida deliberately underreport their numbers?

2) the people making predictions that it won‚Äôt be a big deal have studied all of the other variants and see no correlation - aka similarities - that this mutation will be more transmissible or dangerous"

424,Any mask recommendations?
425,I have 3M Auras but they really aren't comfortable for me.
426,I also have powecom KN95's but the seal doesn't feel so secure.
427,Higher population + less rural = higher infection rate.

437,"In my humble opinion, it‚Äôs a bit irresponsible of CNN to give these people any publicity."
438,"""About 3%"" were fired/quit

""More than 92%"" of state workers **still employed** are vaccinated

""Roughly 3%"" received an accommodation

441,Put your insult is just rude.
442,are they really watching it or are they saying they are while sneaking away to the pub
443,I‚Äôm not against people getting the vaccine.
444,By all means if that‚Äôs what you want to do then go for it.
445,But trying to create a mandate so people get it in fear of losing their jobs is just wrong no matter what way you try to look at it.
446,Plus if you already have the vaccine why are you worried about other people getting it.
447,Your good your body is protected right?
448,mind sharing a source?
449,"seems pretty extreme to blame this on kids.. but I haven't researched it at all yet, so very adhoc for me to suggest"
450,"Still got much lower death rates than the US for instance, where a significant proportion of the population believes that vaccines are Bill Gates tracking devices."
451,I'd call them morons.
452,"89% of those age 12 and up are vaccinated, that‚Äôs why."
453,"There seems to be a trend that short surges are frequent, while one long surge prevents further surges."
454,"My question is, which cost is more worth it in this sense."
455,"I mean people have a lot of hesitancy with the vaccines some reason, ranging from not realizing how effective they are inspite of the data we have, to full on conspiracy theories, coupled with the fact that natural immunity seems to be very good, they say that they don't need it."
456,"I personally would opt for the vaccine in both cases, but others won't, even the possibility of added immunity after a a vaccine wouldn't convince them."
457,"Those rules were relaxed a lot when they made the science focused Coronavirus subreddit, this became about news only so it's cool if we talk mild politics"

463,"Plus, Florida isn't reporting data very accurately or consistently."

585,Immunocompromised and immunosuppressed are different.
586,Immunocompromised implies that someone suffers from a condition that in some way reduces their immune response.
587,Immunosuppressed refers to those (such as myself) that are receiving immunosuppressive therapies.
588,"It's clear that one of these is more permanent than the other, but keep in mind that many (if not *most*) people who are immunosuppressed will continue to be immunosuppressed for the rest of their lives."
589,"For instance, I will be on immunosuppressants for the rest of my life, as my condition is chronic and requires constant immunosuppression for treatment."
590,"Now, if there comes a point that all the treatments available to me no longer work, I'll need a surgery that will completely remove part of my large intestine, and at that point, I *may* no longer require immunosuppressants."
591,"This surgery is a last resort though, and chances are that I'll just be on immunosuppressants for the remainder of my life, as with many others who are immunosuppressed."
592,"Regardless, this is an important distinction that should be made for your comment."
593,"As for your comment about organ transplants, you should read [this article](https://www.nih.gov/news-events/nih-research-matters/organ-transplants-without-life-long-drugs) to better understand the methods that reduce the longevity of the immunosuppressive therapy that you'd go through after receiving a new organ."
594,"Otherwise, you *would* be on immunosuppressive therapy for the rest of your life."
595,"You're right that those receiving chemotherapy are ""transitory"", as you said, but I'm unsure what the proportion of those receiving chemotherapy vs. lifetime immunosuppressive therapy is."
596,"I certainly wouldn't say that the majority of *immunosuppressed* individuals are transitory, and I definitely wouldn't say that the majority of *immunocompromised* individuals are."

660,Of course the former is from high vaccine hesitancy; in those countries it comes from an entire (rational) distrust of government and also (in some places) religious leaders taking part in politics to push anti-vaccine agendas.

674,"Current vaccines don't completely stop infection, just reduce it, and protect against the worst effects."
675,Even if we manage to stamp it out then it will stay active in a pool somewhere and spread back as soon as people move around.
676,What we can hope is that after most people are vaccinated it just becomes an illness that we can deal with - and hopefully it will eventually mutate into something less harmful.
677,This is the first major worldwide pandemic that we've had a vaccine for during the pandemic; in every other case we've developed immunity to it and/or it's mutated into a less deadly form (e.g.
678,Spanish Flu).
679,"The other possibility is that we manage to create a vaccine that completely protects us against infection, but I haven't heard much about that possibility."

760,It doesn't matter for efficacy calculations.
761,The unvaccinated who ended up in hospital are the control group.
762,Because vaccines don‚Äôt prevent Covid.
763,They prevent death by Covid.
764,Taking all the other precautions prevents Covid.

770,Quintessential 90% of reddit right there.
771,"But right now that's really confounded, the people most likely to be reinfected so soon are probably also the people with the weakest immune system, so they're not the same group as all initial infections."
772,"It's possible that reinfections are worse than the initial one (that would also be bad news for vaccines), but so far there's not really any good data showing that."
773,"I don't know, the original idea was once you got vaccinated you didn't need a mask, then it was never mind, delta, everyone has to wear a mask after all, vaccines don't matter, only masks."
774,"Like I never thought vaccines meant 100% immunity -- but I did think they meant, like, normal life and covid will just be a very minor thing if you even get it."
775,most likely not.
776,Just one of the mRNA ones.
777,"On the case of Moderna‚Ä¶ probably a normal one, since the half dose is still on going."
778,Overall it seems to induce a really good reaction.

780,Care to elaborate?
781,I'm just making the point that this isn't the government mandating vaccines.
782,This is the government restricting private businesses' rights to mandate vaccines in their own workplace.
783,It's the opposite of what you think it is.
784,My friend in the UK has covid for the 3rd time now.
785,Luckily they got vaccinated so it isn‚Äôt that bad this time.
786,"There was a brief moment when they said we could stop masking, like a week, then it was all never mind, mask everywhere it doesn't matter what shot you got, delta will kill your family, and now they're wearing off and we need to get more shots apparently."
787,"I needed more than a few days to get ready to go out and meet people again, after so long without wearing makeup or nice clothes or going to the gym or whatever, and it was over before I was ready."
788,This is one of the dumbest articles ever.
789,Casual romance all but dead?
790,Go on Tinder.
791,90% of men and women both are only looking for casual hookups whether their bios say so or not.
792,There's also been a big rise in STDs since Covid began.

794,Like you said have we truly ever been free?

796,"The article says it depends on the person, they expect a range of 3 months to five years between reinfections, though that's obviously based on very early data, no-one has had any chance to be ""reinfected after five years"" yet."
797,that is due to non profit sports.
798,"only Football and Men's Basketball usually make money which is then subsidizes other sports like track, swimming etc."
799,"I find this unlikely, as many scientists believe common cold coronaviruses used to be more dangerous to humans but our exposure over time limits their danger."
800,Kids that get exposed to covid growing up are going to be able to handle it better when they get it as adults.
801,Your study points out that reinfection was more common among the immune compromised and those who had already been hospitalized for covid.
802,So it should come as no surprise that they are more likely to be hospitalized.
803,The healthiest people were the least likely to be reinfected.
804,"I would be shocked if, once controlled for this, that reinfected people were more likely to be hospitalized for covid."

850,GIGGITY!
851,Vaccination rates have multiple uses.
852,"""Percentage of the eligible vaccinated"" can help you e.g."
853,"reach polling goals or figure out when to give up, but it has no actual direct use or meaning except to compare scores."
854,"""Percentage of the total population vaccinated"", or really ""percentage of the total population vaccinated+recovered"" is the metric to judge when the pandemic will end, which is what I consider more important (but opinions differ)."

&gt; To solve this problem, the BNT162b2 mRNA has a modified nucleotide building block that doesn‚Äôt affect its ability to function as an mRNA, but instead makes it less of a target for our immune systems."
914,"It also turns out that this modification makes the mRNA easier to be deciphered into proteins by ribosomes, so they can make more of the spike protein faster."
915,"This means that the spike protein mRNA remains in our cells longer before it‚Äôs broken down, and at the same time allows more spike protein to be made at a faster rate."

&gt;  
&gt;White House officials, anticipating the approval of coronavirus shots for 5- to 11-year-olds within weeks, will rely on doctors, clinics and pharmacies instead of mass inoculation sites."
984,"&gt;  
&gt;WASHINGTON ‚Äî The campaign to vaccinate young children in the United States against the coronavirus will not look like it did for adults."
985,There will be no mass inoculation sites.
986,Pediatricians will be enlisted to help work with parents.
987,Even the vials ‚Äî and the needles to administer doses ‚Äî will be smaller.
988,"&gt;  
&gt;Biden administration officials, anticipating that regulators will make the vaccines available to 5- to 11-year-olds in the coming weeks, are laying out plans to ensure that some 25,000 pediatric or primary care offices, thousands of pharmacies, and hundreds of school and rural health clinics will be ready to administer shots if the vaccine receives federal authorization."
989,"&gt;  
&gt;The campaign aims to fulfill the unique needs of patients largely still in elementary school, while absorbing the lessons from the rollout of vaccines to other age groups."
990,"&gt;  
&gt;This month, Pfizer and BioNTech asked the Food and Drug Administration to authorize emergency use of their vaccine for 5- to 11-year-olds, a move that could help protect more than 28 million people in the United States."
991,"A meeting to discuss the authorization is set for Oct. 26, and an F.D.A."
992,"ruling could come in the days after, possibly clearing a path for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to make recommendations on a pediatric dose in early November."
993,"&gt;  
&gt;If that happens, the Federal Emergency Management Agency will provide reimbursement for ‚Äúfull funding to states to support vaccinations and outreach,‚Äù said Sonya Bernstein, a senior policy adviser for the White House Covid-19 Response Team."
994,That support would involve site setup as well as logistical help like providing transportation to and from vaccine sites.
995,"&gt;  
&gt;‚ÄúWe know that access is going to be critical here,‚Äù Ms. Bernstein said, adding that the administration has in recent weeks looked at ways to provide a ‚Äúkid-friendly experience that makes sure that we‚Äôre getting shots in arms with trusted providers in ways that makes parents feel comfortable.‚Äù  
&gt;  
&gt;The process will not look or feel the way it did when other groups in the United States were first authorized to receive vaccines."
996,"The 5-to-11 age group, with 28 million children, is far larger than the 12-to-15 group, with 17 million, who became eligible for the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine in May."
997,"But the younger group will not be expected to line up at mass vaccination sites: ‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt want lines of kids,‚Äù said Ms. Bernstein, who pointed out that children tend to be more sensitive patients."
998,(Read: They cry.)
999,"Pediatrician‚Äôs offices, children‚Äôs hospitals and pharmacies with in-store clinics will be the preferred options."
1000,"&gt;  
&gt;The needles that administer the vaccine and the vials that hold it will need to be smaller to be more easily stored."
1001,"(The Pfizer dose for children ages 5 to 11 is expected to contain 10 micrograms, rather than the 30-microgram dose used for ages 12 and up.)"
1002,"To keep doses from spoiling, the child-size vials can be stored for up to 10 weeks at standard refrigeration temperatures, and six months at colder temperatures, according to a memo administration officials plan to make public on Wednesday."
1003,"&gt;  
&gt;Taking cues from what worked when shots were opened to teenagers, whose vaccinations generally require parental consent, officials are also leaning heavily on local health experts, who they believe are more trusted in their communities and can help reach high-risk children."
1004,"‚ÄúChildren‚Äôs hospitals and health systems will be a critical part of our efforts to advance equity and ensure access for our nation‚Äôs highest-risk kids, including those with obesity, diabetes, asthma or immunosuppression,‚Äù the memo said."
1005,"&gt;  
&gt;But while the administration aims to eliminate the types of availability and efficiency problems that plagued the initial vaccine process, reluctance has persisted among parents."
1006,"&gt;  
&gt;[According to polling by the Kaiser Family Foundation](https://www.kff.org/coronavirus-covid-19/poll-finding/kff-covid-19-vaccine-monitor-trends-among-children-school/) published in late September, only about one in three parents of 5- to 11-year-olds planned to get their children inoculated ‚Äúright away‚Äù once a vaccine is authorized."
1007,Another third said they wanted to ‚Äúwait and see‚Äù how the vaccine affected children.
1008,"But that same polling showed that reluctance among parents of teenagers had dropped in the months since vaccines had become available, and nearly half of parents of those ages 12 to 17 said their teenagers had received at least one dose."
1009,"&gt;  
&gt;Hospitalizations and deaths from Covid-19 are uncommon in children, [according to data](https://www.aap.org/en/pages/2019-novel-coronavirus-covid-19-infections/children-and-covid-19-state-level-data-report/) collected by the American Academy of Pediatrics, but experts point out that children are still susceptible to serious or long-haul versions of the illness."
1010,"&gt;  
&gt;‚ÄúOf course, adults are going to have much more severe diseases, but that doesn‚Äôt mean that children are not affected as well,‚Äù said Dr. Flor Munoz-Rivas, an associate professor of pediatric infectious diseases at Baylor College of Medicine."
1011,"‚ÄúChildren are typically ones that are vectors of transmitting the virus,‚Äù she said, and preventing them from getting infected ‚Äúcould potentially also have some effect‚Äù in slowing the spread of the virus."

1032,The major difference is that we've had a reasonably successful vaccine roll out between October 2020 and today.

1128,Now it's 750 so it's up 800%.
1129,These are not mild cases.
1130,These are cases that end in death or permanent suffering and disability.
1131,A global pandemic limiting access to routine medical care?
1132,"The vaccine production is low due to the low demand both domestically and internationally for sputnik v, we can have much higher production if people actually wanted it."
1133,Putin's aggressive policies in the past really backfired here both domestically and internationally.
1134,Amazing the degree the tenth amendment to the constitution wasn‚Äôt even enough to make it clear that state law trumps federal law.
1135,They could have just not tried blocking the patenting of the vaccines in the first place...
1136,Nice anecdote
1137,Yeah it was well worded clickbait.
1138,"It's a damn shame so many people are sceptical of the vaccine, most people I know who got it have nothing but positive things to say about it."
1139,"I disagree with a lot of things my government does but this seems like a good idea,"
1140,somtimes its obvius enuogh what the word is and I don't fael like goin  back to fix it...try saying it like I spellted it with an british axcent - you'll sound like a weathly barran
1141,Pfizer has worked well for me.

1155,&gt;what else can we do?
1156,"Keep wearing masks, which takes only seconds to do."
1157,Don't gather in small indoor spaces.
1158,It's not hard to do these things.

1162,"I guess I assumed that being a doctor automatically means that you have an appreciation for the scientific process, but I guess hubris is a disease that can infect everyone."
1163,"I'd love to know if these MDs have the same characteristics - a part of me suspects that it has to do with feeling that you're the smartest person in the room, that doesn't need to learn anymore, that the concept of 'continuing education' = weakness."
1164,"I'm not so sure it's always age or where one lives - anecdotally, I know of a young graduate MD, who lives in one of America's largest cities, who is advising everyone he knows not to get the jab."
1165,"Leaving the 2nd question blank was a risky strategy from Newsom's campaign, I'm glad it paid off."
1166,Should have encouraged people to pick the highest trending Democrat.
1167,They have one location in San Francisco.
1168,Why is this even a story?
1169,&gt;Popular California burger chain In-N-Out is refusing to comply with San Francisco‚Äôs mandate that restaurants check vaccine cards before allowing customers to dine indoors ‚Äî a move that resulted in a temporary shutdown of the city‚Äôs only location.
1170,"I don‚Äôt even want a non working week, I just want to work from home again lol"
1171,"My people have definitely been doing the best they can, even in spite of ineffective government, a colonial overlord, crumbling infrastructure, a crime wave, and trashed economy."
1172,People incorrectly frame things as binary when really almost everything in life is probabilistic.
1173,"It is not correct to say ‚Äúvaccines don‚Äôt work‚Äù, or ‚Äúvaccines work‚Äù."
1174,It is correct to say something like ‚Äúvaccines cut your risk of infection by 80% and your risk of severe effects of Covid by over 90%‚Äù.
1175,"https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/70/wr/mm7037e1.htm

So if you have a 1% chance per day of getting infected without vaccine, then with vaccine that drops to 0.2% per day."
1176,Masks also help.
1177,"Masks reduce the spread of viruses FROM an infected person TO I infected people, and well fitting masks reduce the number of viruses inhaled by people as well."
1178,"Depending on the masks you‚Äôre wearing, the reduction could be 70%."
1179,"https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2776536

So when you have someone vaccinated with a 0.2% chance of getting infected each day based on their behavior without masks, then with masks that should be 0.06% chance of being infected per day."
1180,All these things multiply together.
1181,"Vaccines, masking, distancing, ventilation, air filtration, etc."
1182,What happened with vaccines and public messaging is unfortunate.
1183,"It looked like vaccines were going to be our ticket to not needing any other measures, because vaccines alone were going to sufficiently reduce spread and harm."
1184,"Then Delta happened, which is much more infectious."
1185,So we had to bring back some other measures.
1186,The big unknown right now is what are we going to do once we reach a stable number of vaccinations and recovered people.
1187,Will the disease at that point be mild enough that we don‚Äôt need other measures?
1188,Maybe we‚Äôll still have other measures on public transit?
1189,Who knows.
1190,"But it‚Äôs not worth worrying about, just do the things you want to be doing as safely as possible, as long as those things don‚Äôt unnecessarily endanger other people."
1191,[deleted]
1192,Certainly good news!
1193,At my brothers job in New York City which employees a heck of a lot of people from experts in their field all the way down to maintenance people they started to roll out the testing option as an alternative to the vaccine mandate and then as they started to receive pushback they just said eff it and did a straight a vaccine mandate.
1194,He said pretty much everyone buckled.
1195,Everyone except for a few people who were let go.
1196,Now he walks around at work he knows that everyone who hasn‚Äôt been let go is vaccinated.

1324,Everyone should continue taking basic precautions and isolate if they get infected.
1325,"And as for further variants, I know the UK is tracking a sub variant of Delta - however there is no reason to think that that variant is any more dangerous than Delta."
1326,"And regarding long covid, the research is all over the place on that, there's absolutely no consistency in the findings."
1327,Its completely messed up by the fact that everyone who has come down with anything long term in any sort of vicinity to testing positive for covid is blaming covid for whatever they've come down with long term.

1349,I was just reading some local news that at the moment here are around three times as many people with the flu than with covid and this without widespread flu testing.
1350,I share your concerns however.
1351,The high rate of viral circulation in UK despite high vaccination is worrisome and doesn't paint a good outlook for other countries this winter.

1356,Well you have to be vaccinated for flu regularly and they rotate strains so you're getting a shot for the same strain multiple times in your life so I think that supports that it's doesn't provide very long lasting immunity.

1363,"We had 1565 active cases as of yesterday, that's 500 per million, positivity rate 1.86% (Uruguay)."
1364,A lot of vaccines are a three shot series.
1365,Don't get down hearted yet.
1366,It's not at all unusual to need a third shot.

1376,I‚Äôm genuinely curious if there were people screaming ‚Äútyranny!‚Äù  about the polio vaccine.
1377,"There sure weren‚Äôt when schools required every other vaccine kids get, until Covid showed up and suddenly public health is a political football."
1378,What you qouted is not modifying the sequence.
1379,It's modifying the chemistry - the bond between the nucleotides.
1380,"And no, both pfizer and Moderna did not modify the exact same way - the chemistry is the same (this was academically discovered) but the locations in the sequence are not the same."
1381,I would hope there are fewer deaths with the difference in vaccination from last January!
1382,The huge number of cases is a problem though even more for being unnecessary.
1383,Why do people accept a high and increasing number of ill and contagious people?
1384,"We know high levels of infection are harmful to vulnerable people, even if vaccinated (see Colin Powell.)"
1385,We know more infection means more chances of variants and the UK is already tracking a sub-variant of delta.
1386,We know people will get long Covid and disabling medical conditions.

1393,"that said, check the actual FDA reviewed studies and actual legitimate studies since then to find your personal % of myocarditis with the vaccine and then check the % of myocarditis for covid and you'll find that it is better to get the vaccine and avoid covid."
1394,i was opposed to the vaccine when it first came out since none of the study details were published when trump was suggesting dates for it prior to the election (similarly to how biden was saying that he wanted approvals by a certain date this fall).
1395,"i waited until the studies came out, i checked the effectiveness percentages, and then got my vaccine the first day i was eligible"
1396,[deleted]
1397,"Given enough time everyone will come into contact with the virus, this comes from covids endemic properties."
1398,I repeat: everyone.
1399,Obviously you are far better off after getting your 2nd shot.
1400,"A covid infection can also cause myocarditis, more often and way more severe than a vaccination."
1401,Therefore the only logic decision is to get vaccinated.
1402,"This is not an issue of: ""i wont vaccinate so i dont have the tiny risk of mild myocarditis"", no, the issue is with missing your 2nd shot you increase your risk of severe myocarditis and other severe illnesses from covid infection."
1403,"For the record im also young, male and with some heart issues."
1404,"I encouraged my mums boss to get the shot as he also has a heart condition, bypass etc."
1405,"After i told him to get a docotors opinion, who confirmed my encouragement of vaccination he got the shot."
1406,People with hearth conditions are even more encouraged to get the vaccine as they are at higher risk of severe covid illness.
1407,&gt; Should I Still Get Myself or My Child Vaccinated?
1408,&gt; Yes.
1409,CDC continues to recommend that everyone aged 12 years and older get vaccinated for COVID-19.
1410,"The known risks of COVID-19 illness and its related, possibly severe complications, such as long-term health problems, hospitalization, and even death, far outweigh the potential risks of having a rare adverse reaction to vaccination, including the possible risk of myocarditis or pericarditis."
1411,"&gt; If you or your child has already gotten the first dose of the Pfizer-BioNTech or Moderna vaccine, it‚Äôs important to get the second dose unless a vaccination provider or your doctor tells you not to get it."
1412,"&gt; If you have concerns about COVID-19 vaccination, talk with your or your child‚Äôs doctor, nurse, or clinic."

1478,Extremely low vaccine uptake.
1479,People simply don‚Äôt want the vaccine unfortunately.
1480,We've been living with the threat of long flu / long cold / long whatever our entire lives.
1481,It's real but it's not a reason to stay home and miss out on life.

1486,Should hopefully be this week!
1487,"I got the J&amp;J, so I'll probably have to wait just a bit longer than you."
1488,The low donation numbers are mainly due to very disappointing production output of the J&amp;J and AstraZeneca vaccine.
1489,"Currently Pfizer and Moderna are still being used for either initial vaccination or boosters, so there is actually still not that much to donate."
1490,"However, Germany alone has donated more than 20 million for example, so it is clearly moving forward."
1491,People who got J&amp;J really got screwed.
1492,Lower initial effectiveness and now the J&amp;J booster gives a 4X protection improvement.
1493,Compared with Moderna booster that gives 76X.
1494,"In hindsight, J&amp;J should never have been approved."
1495,"The ""one shot solution"" was bogus."

1541,it was really cool to see
1542,"The Sputnik vaccine appears to be similar in efficacy to other vaccines, sure."
1543,Problem seems to be with production - they only managed to produce 45 million of the promised billion doses for export.
1544,"Russians clearly don‚Äôt want the Sputnik vaccine, so perhaps a choice in vaccines would convince certain Sputnik-skeptic Russians to vaccinate?"

1546,"I'll hand you this, you've definitely given it a lot of thought."
1547,"There's a zero percent chance of this happening, mostly because it's such an extreme take that even pro-vax folks would revolt at that point."
1548,"You'd be talking massive, nationwide civil unrest and the forces that are entrusted with keeping the domestic peace would probably be standing in solidarity with the protestors."
1549,A move this extreme would quite literally undermine the power of the government and probably end up with it being overthrown.
1550,Vaccinate people until they get up to a level of protection that prevents all but the most mild of illness.
1551,It doesn't seem like two doses of the current vaccines is enough for that.
1552,Maybe 3 will.
1553,"the low of early summer is again a low period for covid in ""most places"" as you mentioned."
1554,you'll want to compare lows with lows and highs with highs to more accurately know if things are getting better or worse.
1555,most recent data i've seen is still showing delta at 99% so presumably what we are seeing is waning immunity (as you can see from the nyt chart back to showing 70+ age increasing) which should be fixed by the boosters going out (last i checked we were at 10% of the senior population had their third).
1556,things aren't much worse than a year ago.
1557,"you keep saying that, but it's still not true."
1558,at most it is currently 15% worse (and falling) with very few places maintaining the same kind of precautions they had last year at this time.
1559,"yes different states peak at different times and yes the combined immunity of vaccines plus confirmed cases will be different for different places, but overall no, it's not worse."
1560,"and yes, the US is doing strain monitoring."
1561,the data is published weekly and typically someone (or a dozen someones) will post the link when it goes out.
1562,My company is still WFH.
1563,"Business has been good during the pandemic, and with all the new hires and acquisitions, there isn't enough office space for everyone now."
1564,"Yep, if they are going to give a testing requirement to people who have some sort of exemption to the vaccine it should be daily testing."
1565,right now yes but that's because of everyone that is there because of Covid.
1566,"If your hospitals were overrun before you can't blame that on heart disease, the hospitals had other issues to work out."
1567,Mask mandates are definitely not accepted in most of the world.
1568,[removed]
1569,Is there anything different about why Russia's numbers have been so very high over the past several weeks (usually only second in number of deaths per day to the United States)?
1570,Anything special that is driving the Russian surge?
1571,Or is it mostly related to the same sort of bad behavior we are seeing elsewhere (i.e.
1572,"low vaccination rates, refusal to engage in proper masking/distancing/social behaviors to mitigate transmission, etc."
1573,)?
1574,"Don‚Äôt get me wrong, I only mean that Sputnik have not produced enough vaccines to meet its worldwide demand."
1575,"If vaccine uptake in Russia was like Western Europe, there is a chance there would be a shortage."
1576,Based in n out.
1577,"I‚Äôm just waiting on the third moderna booster to clear, and then I‚Äôm going to get it!"
1578,Lol what?
1579,"Where I live, among the vaccinated people that are hospitalized, the lowest % of them got the Sputnik-V vaccine."
1580,"I got it as well, actually it was the only one I wanted to get even though in my country we had Pfizer, AZ and Sinopharm too and had a lot of contacts with people who tested positive for covid only a few hours or a day later, yet didn't have a single symptom of the disease."
1581,Sputnik-V works perfectly.
1582,Let's hope.
1583,It was shocking how bad the deaths were/are on the current wave when we had 50%-65% of adults vaccinated and increased access to monoclonal antibody treatments.
1584,On second look I think breakdown that average is per age group.
1585,Which is a strange thing to report‚Ä¶ but the average overall is what is reflected in the line chart.
1586,I just did the rough math and it seems like that‚Äôs what they‚Äôre doing.
1587,Maybe it‚Äôs an attempt to reflect the over 70s disproportionately effecting hospitalizations?
1588,Shocker.
1589,Depends on the restrictions.
1590,"Mask mandates will be accepted after initial resistance, occupancy restrictions probably, shelter in place/lockdowns probably not"

1601,I didn't think it'd take a global pandemic to actually drain the swamp.
1602,I  hope more of such good news comes out about leaders who intentionally sabotaged recovery efforts.
1603,most people are dumb as fuck from what I can tell.
1604,i heard someone say that because of ~~columbus~~  indiginous people's day the places that do 14 day average comparisons might be messed up for a bit.
1605,"!remindme 14 days ""take a fresh look at vermont's hospitalization numbers to see how they compare to june"""
1606,"Well...if I knew someone was unvaccinated...I'd start  asking other questions...

Might be a bit revealing....and would certainly be a red flag."
1607,If they are not interested in other people's health...what else do they not care about?
1608,Passing on STDs???
1609,Yeah...might be a killer for your sex life...but then I don't assume you get much sex while attached to a ventilator either!
1610,"I think India did it

We got Delta cause of it (everyone assumed)"
1611,I‚Äôm not even talking about mandates lol.
1612,You‚Äôre mad at an argument I‚Äôm not making.
1613,My only point is wearing a mask is a simple behavior change that should not be so taxing.
1614,"If the pandemic does get down to manageable levels, sure, nix the mandate."
1615,I‚Äôve done indoor dining without a mask and been with people without them on plenty of times.
1616,But wearing one in crowded areas while it‚Äôs still a threat is really easy and simple and shouldn‚Äôt be such a point of contention.
1617,"You‚Äôre really mad about a simple easy thing, that I‚Äôm not even arguing should be mandatory forever."
1618,Also we could help deaf people by learning ASL.
1619,Much clearer communication than forcing them to read lips.
1620,Any updated timeline on kids under 5 getting vaccinated?
1621,Any clue when the data is submitted?
1622,All the news articles gloss over it since 5-11 is probably imminent.
1623,"Yes, last year there was a winter spike which is quite predictable for the reason you cite."
1624,I don‚Äôt think so what implies that at all.
1625,So what implies that we will have to learn to live with COVID.
1626,Which is 100% true.
1627,I‚Äôll save you a click: little is known about it.
1628,[There are steep declines in flu cases at the end of flu season.
1629,](https://www.cdc.gov/flu/weekly/weeklyarchives2021-2022/ILI40.html) Obviously it's not an indication every year that the flu is dying off.
1630,Cycles of infection produces the boom/bust of waves.
1631,Over time genetic evolution and waning immunity produces more a susceptible population while environmental factors (ie indoor gatherings) increase the opportunities of spread.
1632,"Not saying Delta wasn't a factor, just that we have no reason to expect COVID outbreaks to become very rare the way measles is."
1633,"It's all these ""daring"" people who build up a mountain of bullshit."
1634,"No, I‚Äôm not saying that at all."
1635,I‚Äôm hoping we can get below the lows seen in early summer and stay there.
1636,"I‚Äôm worried the vaccine isn‚Äôt effective enough against whatever strain we‚Äôre seeing here, and I‚Äôm wondering if this shit trend will continue and be exacerbated by the holidays or not."
1637,"I‚Äôm triple vaccinated, but wondering WTF is going on, why things are so much worse the a year ago even in places with super high vaccination rates."
1638,And I‚Äôd like to know if the US is actually doing genetic strain monitoring or not.
1639,The UK also tests at more than double the rate of the US.

1646,"I'm sure it will hit my child's school soon, and what happens then?"
1647,"Young people may not die, but still may end up with long covid or can be seriously ill. No mitigation at school really scares me."

1649,"They can close shop and move back to Utah, Animal style."
1650,"Again with this ""clothes"" bullshit."
1651,A mask that covers your face and causes difficulties to the deaf and remembers you to be in full pandemic mode even after the pandemic is over is not comparable to wearing fucking clothes.
1652,"We didn't have a mask mandate for the flu, we shouldn't have one when the pandemic ends."
1653,"The problem with this...

&gt; No risk of ""overwhelming"" hospitals."
1654,What's that mean?
1655,"No out of state nurses, no need for ""surge"" ICU support, no calling up the national guard, no cancelling elective procedures."
1656,Hospital workers can do their normal 2019 level hours and handle the patient load.
1657,... Is that the average layperson does not understand how exponential math works.
1658,At all.
1659,It's spreading very quickly there.
1660,Is there any reason to believe it won't do the same when it arrives in other countries?
1661,The reporting frequency is screwing up the averages I think.
1662,"The line of the chart is showing 7 per day but the little box readout is showing 2, despite the line not showing a 2 per day average since June."
1663,Why even bother with the second part when the initial statement or premise is already ***completely wrong***???
1664,You've already subterfuged *your own argument.
1665,*
1666,It should be 100%.
1667,The CAF had shots for everyone in May/June.
1668,"Most units made it a mandatory parade to go to the vaccine location, but obviously couldn‚Äôt force the shot."
1669,The ones that aren‚Äôt getting it are mostly far right idiots.
1670,That we‚Äôre sad that PPC didn‚Äôt win.
1671,That think social programs shouldn‚Äôt exist.
1672,I hope they get removed come Nov 1st
1673,its hard to tell.

1675,"[https://www.who.int/en/activities/tracking-SARS-CoV-2-variants/](https://www.who.int/en/activities/tracking-SARS-CoV-2-variants/)

Odds are better for more dangerous variant, if the infection numbers stay high."
1676,They didn‚Äôt really have a choice.
1677,"Restrictions are also removed in the Netherlands, Norway, Sweden, etc ‚Äî why is the UK doing worse?"
1678,"My husband was just in the Netherlands, and he said no one was masked up anywhere."
1679,"If you are worried about heart issues your options are either living inside a bubble to ensure you won't get Covid19 or get the vaccine, a Covid19 infection without immunity for sure will be worse for the heart than the vaccine even in the worst case."
1680,Doesn‚Äôt someone post this same question everyday?
1681,We are for vaccines.
1682,Anti-vaxxers are killing people who would have  lived if they had been vaccinated.

1726,"&gt; Germany is testing around 900,000 people per week..

Two different numbers."
1727,Germany unfortunately only reports PCR tests .
1728,The UK number is PCR tests + rapid tests.
1729,I know for a fact that the tests at our work do not get reported anywhere.
1730,Only if someone tests positive with the rapid tests are they required to take a PCR test.
1731,And that result will get reported.
1732,Doctors can of course order PCR tests right away.
1733,"So I'm fully vaccinated, have been since april.."

1738,"Uk government = dithering, blithering ,smug, entitled and knownothing arseholes ü§î"
1739,95+% of hospitalization cases are the unvaccinated.
1740,You are 19 to 29 times more likely to be hospitalized if you are unvaccinated.

1743,"Some degree of checking vaccination or testing, but also wore a respirator and stayed out of the pit and tight crowds because coming up positive would make getting home a huge pain in the ass."
1744,Tested negative twice since.
1745,Among friends who went a month prior they reported the only ones who got covid were either unvaccinated or were running around general camping/the pit sharing smokes and bumps with randos.

1748,Casual romance all but dead my arse.
1749,As long as their are dicks and vags and alcohol and drugs there'll always be hook ups and casual sex.
1750,I would not have sex with someone who is anti-vax.
1751,Years ago before COVID19 I ended a date over a woman anti-vax stance.
1752,"First date, she came out as anti-vax and I was like ""Thats nice, good bye"""
1753,"Try the Korean-style ones, they‚Äôre the most comfy I‚Äôve found."

1761,"Most of the Grindr profiles I see specify they're vaxed too, so good luck with that plan I guess?"
1762,&gt;Shows how effective propaganda can be.
1763,The UK government tried to push the narrative that we could forget about covid now and that's exactly what everyone has done.
1764,That's one take.
1765,Another is that the population is just sick of worrying about COVID.
1766,Not everything is some grand scheme orchestrated by the government.
1767,Sometimes the population actually does have a mind of its own.
1768,"Most of the time, in fact."
1769,"Yep, the eye of a hurricane is actually calm."
1770,Not all storms have an eye though.
1771,It would have been better to use ‚Äúcenter‚Äù or ‚Äúmiddle‚Äù in the title instead of ‚Äúeye‚Äù.
1772,How many more people should die from heart related illness from covid damage?
1773,Let's see 1500 people a day can start dying of heart related illnesses.
1774,good news
1775,Wait until we see the actual numbers out of china
1776,I definitely no longer care.

1783,Could someone explain to me the general happy mood in this thread?
1784,I see UK had yesterday 223 deaths reported.
1785,Do you people lack empathy to this leve?
1786,Do you care more about the perception of how well the vaccine is working against delta than about people actually dying?
1787,Also the fact that you get infected with SARS-CoV-2 and don't have a severe case of COVID-19 doesn't mean you are as if you hadn't had it at all.
1788,"We kind of hope there are not long term effects, but you don't know."
1789,"So yeah, number cases is an important paramater for all normal human beings."
1790,You can avoid the paywall on iOS by using reader view.
1791,Would you mind elaborating on the architecture/code improvements after the flu epidemic?
1792,"Wasn't aware there was a history of major changes following it, or at least not because of the flu itself."
1793,Very interesting
1794,[removed]
1795,"UK's case number, hospitalization, death, really never changed much since July peak."
1796,They all remain very high.
1797,They just stopped talking about it and pretend nothing is happening.
1798,The complete lack of any preventive measure is just shocking.
1799,":D 

Oh if COVID was the only reason stopping me from getting laid."
1800,"I meant mutations that can be worrying, not any mutation."
1801,Mutation happens all the time.
1802,Question is if any of them will survive and thrive.
1803,It's mainly children driving the infections in the UK at the moment.
1804,"Hospitalisations are predominantly COVID-deniers and anti-vaxxers, although there is an increasing number of double-vaccinated people being admitted."
1805,"I'm not in the slightest bit bothered about someone who's refused a vaccine dying a miserable death, but I am worried about the impact this is having on unrelated healthcare."
1806,We were very late vaccinating under-18s and restrictions were removed abruptly and completely thanks to our moronic Prime Minister being desperate for people to like him.
1807,Secret gay agenda?
1808,"&gt;[‚Ä¶] his symptoms gained force ‚Äì when he drinks lemonade, it tastes like gasoline, and sometimes he smells smoke that isn‚Äôt there."
1809,My brother in law got a pretty nasty case of C19 4 months ago.
1810,Of course he didn‚Äôt get vaxxed even though we urged him to.
1811,Not because of political stance I think he just‚Ä¶doesn‚Äôt take thing seriously.
1812,But to this day he says he‚Äôll smell smoke and taste gasoline.
1813,Is there anyone that can ELI 5?
1814,Is this a brain/nervous system thing?
1815,You know there are other diseases out there besides COVID and these diseases are more readily spread through fomites like hands?
1816,Someone here should follow the example.
1817,"Even that depends on the area in question, lots of nasty parasites that can be found in dirt (i.e."
1818,the feces thats found in dirt) that can really do a number on us.
1819,"I get the sentiment though, we do need to be exposed to some things in order to build our immune systems."
1820,&gt;Good for how long?
1821,"Exactly thats the question, some of the reports I've seen vary, some say it last a while, more than six months some not so much, it could depend on the severity of the case as well."
1822,"It seems to be inconsistent, and there isn't a lot of data, or at least I haven't found much as of yet."
1823,"Why doesn't this convince people to get at least one dose of the vaccine, after a previous infection, if not two?"
1824,"~50,000 cases a day to ~100 hospitalisations."
1825,&gt;People spreading disease weren‚Äôt having sex before.
1826,"Well they definitely were, seeing as STI's have been increasing for a long time now."
1827,[removed]
1828,Impossible to say without getting tested.
1829,"In theory, you probably have a pretty good immune response however there is individual variation and some people do not generate long-lasting immune responses from being infected."
1830,Sexually distant is the new distancing.

1835,"Maybe, but its still feels like a gamble."
1836,"My friend (healthy, early 40's) got COVID in December, fully vaccinated in the spring and got reinfected in August."
1837,They spend over a month in the ICU.
1838,"I know thats one case and its incredibly rare for this kind of failure to been seen in those that are vaccinated but my point is you don't want to be my friend, you don't want to be that statistical outlier."
1839,"Thats why I recommend people continue to do all they can to avoid getting COVID, vaccinated or not - its a really shitty disease."
1840,Hopefully most people realized on their own that as long as delta was around and far more contagious then mu the truth was mu was never going to be a huge concern as it would be out competed by delta everywhere
1841,"They should for two reasons

1."
1842,Infection does not guarantee that your immune system mounted a strong enough response for long-lasting immunity.
1843,2.
1844,The immune systems response to COVID fades over time.
1845,"(Note the same is true for vaccinate people, just because you were vaccinated does not mean your immune system learned enough from the vaccine and vaccination does not guarantee life-long immunity)."
1846,Boosters are required for COVID.
1847,Its just a lot safer to get the vaccine booster rather than get reinfected.
1848,"As time goes on the effectiveness dwindles, so I‚Äôm assuming everyone will continue to need boosters as time goes on."
1849,It could just become yearly like the flu for the healthier bunch which lines up with the flu vaccine.
1850,If things play out like they did with the flu it‚Äôll become weaker and many people probably won‚Äôt need the vaccine as strongly as they need it now.
1851,I mean let‚Äôs be honest if we look at the numbers they weren‚Äôt that great in terms of the amount of people taking the flu vaccine.
1852,This year I‚Äôm sure  it‚Äôs looking much better as people fear it more due to the pandemic.
1853,If the only ones left are the ones who don‚Äôt care then it does.
1854,Usually the ones who do care would force ‚Äúthose who don‚Äôt‚Äù to take precautions anyway.
1855,Sex&gt;Precautions.
1856,But if neither partner cares about precautions you get STI heaven.
1857,[deleted]
1858,"&gt;I‚Äôd get the vaccine immediately but i still have lots of antibodies

Have you been objectively tested or are you just assuming?"
1859,Just because you got infected does not mean your immune system mounted a strong enough response to produce long-lasting immunity.
1860,"Yes but many countries will be like this from now on, are we just going to see mutations pop up every other week?"
1861,You can also thank the scientists and doctors for the vaccines too.
1862,Natural immunity is effective but for what % of those that were infected and for how long?
1863,Thats really important information to know.
1864,[removed]
1865,Makes perfect sense.
1866,People spreading disease weren‚Äôt having sex before.
1867,With the people taking care of themselves out of the picture the fuckheads have a higher chance of getting laid.
1868,"Regardless of whether or not the new mutation is worth worrying about, the media try to cause fear."
1869,"When Mu was put in variants under investigation, my country's media had it as THE top headline for 3-4 days, while on international media it was just referred as an article somewhere."
1870,They never came back to explain to people that Mu is really not something we should worry about so they obviously did it for the clicks and not for letting people know the scientific truth.
1871,I'd imagine the more you can do to train your body's immune system to fight the virus the better.
1872,Its not like COVID is going away any time soon so if a booster is available I would take it.
1873,"I have a friend (healthy, young 40s) like them but ended up in the ICU for over a month so shit happens."
1874,"My takeaway: avoid getting COVID, vaccinated or not its a really shitty disease to get."
1875,Even the very conservative owner of the local liquor store who shits on democrats voted no.
1876,"He said he thinks newsom handled covid terribly and is a horrible governor,  but he did a hell of a lot better than anyone else would have."
1877,"&gt;coupled with the fact that natural immunity seems to be very good,

Good for how long?"
1878,Because COVID immunity does not last forever and you risk your life every time to get reinfected if your immune system isn't properly trained.
1879,We all just need to get used to the fact that we will be needing boosters for a very long time or risk getting infected and not having enough immunity to survive the infection.
1880,"Welp, looks like its time to acquire a chaturbate addiction"
1881,I understand in England most of the vaccines were Astra Zenica.
1882,Could this be a reason they are picking up a bit with Delta?
1883,"Well there are a couple of issues with natural immunity

1."
1884,It might not take.
1885,"You can get sick but not develop a strong lasting immune response putting you at risk for reinfection, a vaccine booster can prevent that
2."
1886,We still don't really know how long immunity lasts (for either natural or vaccinated populations).
1887,However its clear that it does wane and that boosters are needed.
1888,"So the question becomes:

Would you rather have natural immunity that will wane over time and put yourself at risk for being infected again and having poor outcome or would you rathe take the booster and keep your immunity going?"
1889,I knew someone that caught  it twice within 3 months.
1890,Caught it in May 2020 then again in July 2020.
1891,"Said May knocked them out for a month, then July was only 2 weeks."
1892,"Then they said they weren‚Äôt gonna get vaccinated (this was pre vaccines and pre Delta) cause they had already caught it twice and I was just like uhh, then you can probably catch it a 3rd time and more."
1893,"Yup, honor system doesn't work with people with no honor."
1894,"Well, part of the issue was that when vaccines were not required, the unvaccinated just lie (explicitly or not) and take their masks off wherever the vaccinated would."
1895,So you require everyone to wear masks to make sure that everyone is.
1896,"San Francisco is seeing dropping COVID numbers and high vaccination, so they recently have changed things so that now areas where vaccinations are required don't require masking."
1897,"So that shift is happening, it just requires actual vaccination requirements first."
1898,The honor system where the vaccinated don't need masks but the unvaccinated still are wearing them requires there to be honor among the unvaccinated.
1899,I imagine they don't produce a long lasting immune response.
1900,"Enough to clear the virus, but not enough to remember it the second time around."
1901,"Only now their body is facing a second infection in a compromised state - damaged lungs, worn out energy reserves...Its not like they are facing Round 2 at 100%."
1902,Name a county where their authorities didn't fuck up and now don't need to take the shot
1903,It's purely a function of the virus being still so prevalent and the likelihood of you running into affected people 8s more than encountering measles or whatnot.
1904,"It's not that there is anything particularly magic about this virus or bad about the vaccine, they just ran the numbers of chance of running into infected person times virulence and it came out on the side of booster."
1905,We are eeking out every shred of immunity we can and that's a good thing.
1906,"So fyi to clarify it would be 95% of the global population, not just your own country's pop."
1907,That's if we assume the vaccines are working as of this moment some of the highest vaxd countries got the worst covid.

2142,"Virtually no red tape to cut, no federal system in which federal states governors are constantly throwing wrenches into the work, no human rights that have to be considered, nothing of that which can make a democracy be ineffective in times of crisis."

2144,It's a joke.
2145,Guess that's what happens if you value owning your opponents over running your country in its best interests.
2146,Fucking weak ass strong men politicians...
2147,Well i think the major issue would be proving that a single person is responsible for a covid infection in a building filled with people dying of it and sadly the person who got covid would also have to prove they got it here.
2148,The sad truth is the hospital wouldn't have given those exemptions if they didn't already have a way to make it not their problem.
2149,That will result in more severe measures for a longer time than early measures just to show that they are necessary.
2150,Also it will kill several times as many people.

2164,Depends on your definition of best.
2165,Moderna had significantly worse severe side effects and seems most people agree it has worse mild side effects.
2166,"Meanwhile, the most recent mix and match paper (which used 100ug doses, compared to the half-doses that you get for boosters) had Pfizer better as a booster in one assay and Moderna as a better booster for another assay."

2168,"If you only got one J&amp;J shot though, I'd probably lead towards Moderna."

2305,You're partially correct.
2306,But if it's anything what we've seen in the UK since July it's that deaths won't rise nearly as fast as before.
2307,Cases in the Uk have actually been sky high since July with it reaching 47k 7DA on worldometers and then kind of staying at around 30k-40k till recently when it started to explode again.
2308,Deaths on the other hand went to it's highest point of 143 7DA back in late September.
2309,"Bear in mind back in January at similar case rates they had 1,200+ a day."

2719,"This is obviously multifaceted (it could have coincided with a lot of freshly acquired natural immunity), but it's pretty straightforward that VE against infection drops, and continues to drop with time."

2786,"But of course only a fraction of those are in the 12-18 group, a fraction of *those* caught covid, and then an even smaller fraction of those needed hospitalization."
2787,My point is just that it's really hard to get good numbers on events that happen so rarely to individual people.

2813,It's hard to know what real risks are.

2844,"But at the same time, it‚Äôs a very valid question to ask whether it is even within the Governor‚Äôs authority to ban vaccine mandates."
2845,"I mean, it‚Äôs pretty draconian that the Governor of Texas is trying to use his own authority to limit the authority of public health officials and private employers to enact vaccine requirements."

2921,It‚Äôs gonna be rough but better than last winter at least.
2922,"&gt; Hopefully by Easter next year we'll be doing much better with the majority of kids having caught it and gained immunity, booster jabs, and the end of flu season/better weather."
2923,On a purely Covid basis I reckon we'll probably be at that point by the end of the year.
2924,In the ONS weekly surveys they're reporting that ~8% of children in England have active infections which is similar to the peak in infections that Scotland had in the same age group after they went back to school.
2925,"I wouldn't be surprised if infections start dropping off significantly for that age group in the next week or two, especially with half term coming up."
2926,Flu will probably be rough from the beginning of next year though.
2927,So does logic dictate in this case that 12-18 year old Covid positive is better off without the vaccine?
2928,"Let‚Äôs say 100 kids are positive .8% goes to the hospital, but 93% of the vaccine Covid positive don‚Äôt go to the hospital means 7 kids are in the hospital then with the vaccine and a Covid case requiring more help ?"
2929,There‚Äôs absolutely devastating stories coming out about pregnant women dying.
2930,The delta variant has been ripping through them.
2931,A mother of 4 managed to have her 5th by C-section and her husband also died a few weeks later; they never got to see or name their new baby girl and now all their kids are orphans.
2932,I read a story on r/nursing of a 22 year old mom whose baby was delivered via emergency c-section at 26 weeks and likely had brain damage from being without oxygen.

2952,With the current school infection rates (somewhere close to 8% active infections in school age children nationally) there's a good chance Covid actually burns itself out in that age group.
2953,There should be a respite in cases thanks to half term over the next couple of weeks.

2967,Confirmed cases should count as vaccinated.
2968,The only reason it doesn‚Äôt is because people think it would somehow embolden anti-vaxers.

2982,Yeah people need to stop repeating eligible percentages.
2983,It gives a false idea of how many people are actually vaccinated.
2984,News sites will say shit like so and so place is 85% vaccinated when in reality its 85% of eligible population that's had 1 shot.
2985,When the actual full vaccination percentage is actually around just 60%.
2986,The US has given 10% more of its population a first dose than second doses and all those people have been due for their second shot for multiple months now.
2987,So reporting 1st dose numbers are useless since none of those extra people will ever become fully vaccinated and the fact 1 dose is not good enough against Delta.
2988,The US is only in the 80s percentage wise for people going back for a second dose.
2989,That is absolutely pathetic.

3022,I agree and I think handwaving that away does not necessarily help things or work on the vaccine hesitant.

3057,"It is fair to criticize his decisions but to think that Elder or Paffrath were going to be better with their lack of leadership, skills and ideology I doubt it."
3058,No.
3059,"Well, we don't really know yet when it would be at it's most effective."
3060,It's possible we may find that it works best at 9 months or 12 months or whatever.
3061,"[We now know a longer 6-14 week interval between doses 1 and 2 works better than the 3-4 week interval from the trials](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0092867421012216) - so much better that dose 2 at long gap is looking pretty similar to dose 3 at short gap, so we know that timing matters a great deal, and so far, holding out and waiting has been the superior option - unfortunately, we don't have any data on waiting for the booster yet, so we're guessing here."
3062,"There are no new side effects from a booster so it's low risk, but there's obviously no data on whether you can take a 4th dose at 12 months if that is found to be substantially better.. and given it already works well for severe disease, benefits are not huge either."
3063,The differences between getting one now and waiting for more substantial data on timing the booster are not very big.
3064,But I bring up the differences between the 1st and 2nd dose intervals to remind people that sooner is not better with vaccination schedules.

3186,Tl;dr: H says Y had too small a sample size to draw their conclusions.

3195,"Obviously brief visits don't indicate a high level of severity, but it's still a higher level than no visit at all and the criteria are usually applied equally to both cohorts."

3197,"The study [text](https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/70/wr/mm7042e1.htm) doesn't seem to say, though it's probably in the fine print somewhere if you want to look."
3198,"What is true is that the more vulnerable are a lot more likely to be vaccinated, so this 93% should be considered a (significant) lower bound."
3199,"Probably the Delta variant did not make it into your area, and that might be because of natural immunity from early infections."

3253,The rollout is pending the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) granting approval to the Pfizer jab for children five to 11 years old.
3254,The Biden administration anticipates the approval could come in a matter of weeks.
3255,An FDA expert advisory group is set to meet on October 26 to review data on the efficacy and safety of Pfizer‚Äôs pediatric vaccine.
3256,A Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) vaccine advisory panel is set to consider a recommendation for the vaccine use on November 2 and 3.
3257,Pfizer‚Äôs pediatric jab will be cleared for use on children if the CDC director signs the recommendation.
3258,"In its plan, the White House stated that it would rapidly distribute the vaccines across the country to 25,000 pediatricians‚Äô offices and other primary care sites."
3259,"‚ÄòThese providers will play a critical role in the nationwide effort to get children vaccinated,‚Äô the White House stated."
3260,"‚ÄòTo facilitate this, the Administration is working with states to increase the number of pediatric and primary care providers enrolled to administer the vaccine and to provide the training and resources they need ‚Äì including the vaccine supply in smaller package size and with easier-to-handle storage requirements highlighted above.‚Äô"

3291,"First of all, their data set is way too small."
3292,"5000 seems like a lot, but it's accross every state and covers 80 ages."
3293,There's actually a ton of wildly different groups represented by that data.
3294,There's no way it's evenly distributed and they obviously didn't take that into account in their analysis.
3295,"The conclusions being drawn are way out there, too."
3296,"Like, laymen kind of out there."
3297,The 'scientist' is clearly pumping out material for pop science articles like this and not doing a meaningful analysis of the dataset.
3298,"Which makes sense, as I doubt there will be any follow up."
3299,"""Everyone back in the pile!"""
3300,"Just to clarify: those two things are indeed happening at the same time, but they're not directly connected."
3301,"[Experts are monitoring the AY.4.2 variant and have this to say](https://www.bbc.com/news/health-58965650): 

&gt; At this stage, experts don't think AY.4.2 is likely to take hold - so in time it could well burn out and drop off the watch list."

3320,"For example, although the flu is much less infectious than SARS-COV-2, since their primary mode of infection is through respiratory droplets and other saliva/mucus bodily fluids, seasonal changes in human behavior (such as more people spending more time indoors) can impact infection rates."
3321,"Due to more people staying indoors during winter months, flu infection rates increase."
3322,The same can be said for SAR-COV-2.
3323,"That is a valid comparison so long as the comparison is not used illogically (such as saying ""because of this, COVID-19 is just like the flu and should be treated as such""; that is an illogical conclusion that does not follow from the comparison)."

3358,Something I‚Äôm curious about re myocarditis risk is if some people are just more predisposed to get it whether they‚Äôre infected or get the vaccine.

3365,"Since more people are now spending more time indoors, it stands to reason that the seasonal changes in human behavior can be a factor in the increased infection rates and following that, areas with higher population density could see a higher increase due to that."

3420,Fortunately my younger kids did school online (but were forced back recently because our school board gets pressured by politicians and nutcases) and I think COVID ran so rampant through our school system that the cases are low now because of natural immunity in so many kids.

3449,It's harder for the virus to take hold in places where vaccination rates are high.
3450,"But, there have been plenty of examples of the virus ripping thru highly vaccinated populations."
3451,"And obvious counter to this statement: *""oh it would've been much worse had they not had that level of vaccination""*

ok, but ...."
3452,"But then, there has also been plenty of examples of the virus-spread(cases) dropping off like a wet brick falling, without much of the population being vaccinated at all."
3453,"(in these instances, it would seem other factors influence spread, Rt, etc ... other than our attempts to inoculate a population)."
3454,"Keep in mind, we are talking 'spread', not hospitalization or deaths."
3455,"At least you can use it as an excuse to save face, like I do"
3456, I can‚Äôt wait.
3457,Now more poor nations which have struggled to vaccinate their populations will have a better chance help save their citizens when they get Covid.

3484,Because who can be arsed with that.
3485,I'd not even know how to report it.
3486,I doubt many do.
3487,"is this number ""per day"" or ""active cases""?"
3488,100% they are too prideful about not being vaccinated to lie about it just to get laid.
3489,"More than 6 months, she got her second in early April (maybe late March?)"
3490,so it was something like 6 months and a week or two.
3491,"If you assume that everyone had the same exposure to infection, sure."
3492,I would assume most vaccinated families are doing more things that risk exposure than they did before vaccination.
3493,One example would be school.
3494,Some families who have not vaccinated their children have chosen home schooling options.
3495,"It‚Äôs a personal anecdote, but my kids are back in school this year simply because they are vaccinated."
3496,Their exposure since vaccination has increased dramatically.
3497,I‚Äôm sure it‚Äôs different in different regions.
3498,Some places the exposure has not changed.
3499,That‚Äôs my point though.
3500,"Without accurate controls, your just putting a number to a positive pool."
3501,"&gt;Reinfections and breakthrough infections, assuming natural infection is more or less equivalent to vaccination."
3502,I feel we're flying blind right now.
3503,I would love to see the breakdown each day of who those cases are.
3504,I suspect there is a ton of reinfection and breakthrough infections happening.
3505,"I think sooner or later there won't be a way to spin this other than we either have to come up with a better way to stop infections (vaccines 2.0), or use existing vaccines (boosters) to keep antibody levels sky high."
3506,"I think it's not healthy to keep antibodies ""sky high"" all the time to ward against infections."
3507,"We don't do it with any other disease, because our immune system knows how to make those antibodies."
3508,It may be a stopgap solution while we develop better vaccines.
3509,I have a feeling here that - again - experts have a blind spot.
3510,"Because SARS and MERS infect almost uniquely the lower respiratory tract, they thought that a vaccine generating enough antibodies there would be enough to stop transmissions."
3511,"It turns out that SARS-CoV-2 is able to infect the upper respiratory tract too quite efficiently and the protection induced by vaccines is not that great, hence the high viral loads measured by PCRs."
3512,"So, what we need is intranasal vaccines, but they haven't given any urgency."

3538,&gt;Reinfection tests are expensive and you need to sequence the virus from both the original and new case to prove it's a different one.
3539,It's unlikely to be in the overall population stats.
3540,In the case of UK they have a good database of previous infections so they know who are being reinfected.
3541,"Besides, they are sequencing a lot of cases and using multiplexed PCR tests for many others so they have a hint which variants are people getting infected with."

3553,The uk is one of the worst places in terms of cases right now and I've seen very very few people doing anything at all to mitigate risk.

3701,"This is not like other vaccines, which are meant to prevent you from getting sick at all, or to kill the virus altogether."
3702,"This vaccine does neither of those things, it's only meant to *lessen your symptoms* and even if it reduces your chances of getting sick or spreading the virus, it does not stop it, and you can very much still get sick after being vaccinated, even severely so."
3703,"Also, generally speaking, natural immunity is preferred because your body builds up an immunity that is *appropriate to your body*."
3704,"There is concern that this particular vaccine, not being a traditional one (that works with your bodies natural immune response) might be less effective *because it is so targeted*."

3751,I believe most people are still going to hook up even if you're vaccinated or not
3752,I did not know that!
3753,Maybe not such a problem where I live.
3754,I think it‚Äôs the difference between holding g onto the basic hygiene insights of the last two centuries and creating an entirely sterile environment.
3755,A lot of peoples‚Äô attitude to hygiene is like the anti-vax attitude to vaccines (except perfectly sane people can make this logical error because we haven‚Äôt had education campaigns).
3756,We‚Äôve lost track of how terrible life was without the improvements we‚Äôve achieved in hygiene (in some parts of the world).

3760,Anecdotal confirmation but I had my first drink in first 4 years last May 2020.
3761,Luckily I didn't completely fall off off the wagon  it was very stressful coupesd up with 2 neurotic roommates.
3762,Watching my savings dwindle from being furloughed during the shutdown.
3763,Watching the absolutely bonkers political landscape after not paying attention for 4 years.
3764,Let's hope for those numbers to be reached by the end of the year for all nations in need.
3765,Which appears to be impossible.
3766,"As the UK have demonstrated, the moment you lift restrictions, cases soar even if a large majority of people are vaccinated."
3767,"Right, so 40-50k people getting sick is definitely a time to be cautious, don't you agree?"
3768,the studies I showed said it's more effective than vaccination.
3769,"I don't have the answers for how long, but I don't think we know for the vaccine, either."
3770,I just would prefer if the people in charge didn't hide things or spread misinformation.
3771,So Florida and other US states that have been ravaged by Covid this past summer are just a fluke according to you.
3772,It's pretty hot down there and most living is done outdoors.
3773,Wait....so clogged arteries aren't airborne?
3774,&gt; The question is what is the UK doing differently?
3775,Unvaccinated kids back in school at full capacity with no masks
3776,Sounds like the health inspectors haven't spent enough time ensuring they wash their hands.
3777,americans are crazy
3778,"Honestly at this point, get over it."
3779,"yep, like I said, it's all based on perspective."
3780,"They don't want to do what you are saying, they think its worth some deaths to not have to do that stuff."
3781,"Unless you live in a bubble, hate to break it to you, but most 1st world countries are coming to a similar conclusion or are working their way to the same level of openness."
3782,Covid is endemic.
3783,Any adult can get the vaccine.
3784,Anyone can where an N95 and control their own destiny.
3785,Agreed.

3791,"As long as you are not a politician in charge of such mandates, you have nothing to worry about."
3792,"I work with many people from Eastern Europe, and it's terrible."
3793,"The attitude from the beginning has been ""I am strong, I have a strong immune system, I'm not afraid of covid."""
3794,"Then, when they get it, they don't want to pass for weaklings (and don't want to miss several days of wages) so they come to work coughing and feverish, while saying ""It's nothing, I'm strong"""
3795,I literally cannot clap slow enough... this comment deserves better.
3796,My employer let us work from home for a year only to bring us back at the height of the recent surge with the promise of discussing a return to wfh‚Ä¶they‚Äôve been taking a long time to ‚Äúdiscuss‚Äù
3797,Uruguay has even more doses per population than Israel.
3798,This is multiple data points suggesting 1.5-2 doses per capita is what'll end Delta (though it's not clear Delta ever got off the ground in Uruguay).
3799,"...but you did it with inactivated vaccines and Astrazeneca, right?"
3800,It's really good news for those vaccines.
3801,"The inactivated vaccines are much weaker, but also have much fewer side effects and seem to still do extremely well after a third dose."

3808,Haha yeah COVID....thats why I'm single....haha...
3809,I got my JJ in April.
3810,Plan on getting my Moderna booster today.
3811,I will go into the pharm and pretend like I've never got vaccinated.
3812,Wish me luck!
3813,Hypothetical mandates?
3814,Many businesses and states already mandate vaccination for certain things.
3815,The problem is we don't need people in places like Alabama clogging their already stressed health care system and dead body system with self-inflicted illness.
3816,It would be fine if they had to prove they had a medical record of getting the disease before a certain date s people would not be rewarded for intentionally infecting themselves and others.
3817,"I didn't say we shouldn't be cautious, I said we shouldn't be hyperbolic."
3818,Weird subset of journalists have been pushing this since March 2020

3820,"You make a great point about dirty needles, drug use has increased, and there are other ways to get STD than from sex, like you mentioned."
3821,Wear the best mask you can.
3822,An n95 would make it quite safe.
3823,"Gonna be real if someone said they wouldn‚Äôt go on a date with me for ‚Äúevolutionary‚Äù reasons I would probably rather not want to date them anyways, like what the fuck lmao."
3824,"I bet there is a direct correlation between the increase in the number of people on anti depressants and the decrease in people having sex, dont know how you measure that but those drugs suck the horny right out of you"
3825,Pretty much.
3826,Deaths are a lagging indicator.
3827,Well you can‚Äôt transmit heart disease to others so it‚Äôs not really a good comparison.
3828,"Well I guess you technically could through genetics, but that‚Äôs a topic for another day."
3829,And forcing people who don‚Äôt exercise to stay home would be counter-intuitive while forcing unvaccinated people to stay home effectively solves the problem.
3830,&gt;what else can we do?
3831,"It's widely known what else we can do, lol."
3832,There are tons of options.
3833,"Mask mandates, vaccine passports, lockdowns."
3834,Everything should be on the table.
3835,Because your heart disease can't kill someone else.
3836,Huge difference.
3837,"Yep, no treatment of obese individuals, why should they be treated for an illness they caused by their lack of scientific knowledge to know how to eat properly?"
3838,Shouldn‚Äôt they be restricted by the government because they are stupid by becoming fat?

3840,I demand a recount
3841,&gt; Vaccines that are injected into the arm have done a spectacular job at preventing severe disease and death.
3842,But they do not generate the kind of protection in the nasal passages that would be needed to block all infection.
3843,"That‚Äôs called ‚Äústerilizing immunity.‚Äù [[1]](https://www.statnews.com/2021/08/10/covid-intranasal-vaccines/)

Also 

&gt; The mucosal immune response involves systemic, antigen-specific humoral and cellular immune response in addition to a local response which is characterised by a predominantly cytotoxic T cell response in combination with secreted IgA."
3844,This antibody facilitates pathogen recognition and deletion prior to entrance into the body.
3845,"Hence, administration via the respiratory mucosa can be favoured for all pathogens which use the respiratory tract as entry to the body, such as influenza and for all diseases directly affecting the respiratory tract such as pneumonia."
3846,[[2]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6723941/).
3847,This makes me so happy.
3848,"A few months ago, the island was behind the curve."
3849,"The numbers were worrying, especially since tourism was picking up."
3850,And now it‚Äôs caught up!
3851,I hope they continue to educate people and help get people vaccinated.
3852,"Moderna doesn't know its effectiveness against Delta, neither they nor anyone else paid for large-scale trials after the initial ones last fall."
3853,"We have [this](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMc2103916) which we can combine with [this](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-021-01377-8), and we have [this](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-021-01527-y) and [this](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.09.29.21264089v1) for boosters."
3854,"There's also some possible takeaways from [pfizer's Israel data](https://www.fda.gov/media/153086/download), since it's almost exactly the same vaccine at 1/3 the dose."
3855,"My interpretation is that an efficacy boost from 75% to 95% after the third dose is likely, and (based on pfizer) that a larger cellular response that leads to better breakthrough outcomes and longer-lasting protection is also likely."
3856,We have no idea if 6 months (versus 3 or 9) is the correct timeline for the third dose.
3857,For real world numbers we're going to have to wait for states to collect some data (nothing is ever collected on the federal level).
3858,Why is it important to not be cautious about the unknowns around long covid?
3859,Isn't it exactly the opposite?
3860,Wouldn't it be smarter to be cautious about inflicting lifetime disability on people for no reason?

3862,Canadian idiot Jason Kenney did the same thing in the province of Alberta.
3863,"Declared the pandemic over and also declared summer 2021 as the ""best summer ever""."

3867,Yeah I'm happy about this because I'm tired of knowing that some of my colleagues that I'm stuck in my office with (we've all been back full-time since 9/13) have held out this long.
3868,"But I'm also pissed that THEY will be getting a $500 bonus for getting a shot at a city-run site now, when I went and did the right thing in fucking March at a federally-run site."
3869,You just have to laugh at this point.
3870,"Thought experiment regarding government power and mandates:  
Heart Disease killed 690,000+ Americans in 2020."
3871,Doctors and scientists overwhelmingly agree that healthy diet and exercise can minimize the risk of heart disease.
3872,Should the government mandate diets and exercise when it could save hundreds of thousands of lives?
3873,Why do you think it's realistically acceptable to lock people in their home if they don't want to receive a vaccine?
3874,Don't you think that sounds at least a little insane from an objective standpoint?
3875,So don‚Äôt bother requiring masks on public transit?
3876,I am not following your logic.
3877,I still don't understand why people are pro-Covid and want this pandemic to continue on.

3916,Hospitalizations in Vermont have steadily risen and are at January 2020 levels and climbing right along with infections.
3917,Same with Colorado.
3918,We're testing new highs here and that is with 70+% vaccination rates.

3968,"The variant was noticed by a graph, rather than any knowledge of what its mutations are impacting."

3971,Doesn‚Äôt seem like a suggestion to me.
3972,It‚Äôs a brand new virus.

3974,"Look, we all know that COVID is more deadly than the flu."
3975,No one is arguing that.
3976,But to say that there are no similarities at all is willfully ignorant.

4010,That‚Äôs actually really weird that they‚Äôre testing you when you‚Äôre vaccinated.
4011,My work just requires proof of vaccination.
4012,We were almost certainly always going to need boosters though.
4013,Good news: they‚Äôre about to offer it combined with the flu shot so you can kill two annual birds with one stone.

4018,"Boosters are not much of a surprise and shouldn't be a particular concern, as long as the virus is about the more immunity the better and while we are on this side of the risk reward line we will have boosters."
4019,They do help and with exponential growth every slight reduction in transmission is a huge help.
4020,Vaccines do matter though.
4021,They cut your risk of severe illness and death down to almost zero.
4022,"In my state, which has about 22% breakthrough infections (we vaxxed early) only 4% of the hospitalizations and 1% of the deaths were among vaccinated people, and the average age of those deaths was 84."
4023,"Because of high vax rates and Delta, we‚Äôre predicted to hit herd immunity in December."
4024,I think the big things people are waiting on masks-wise are for hospitalizations to go down and for kids to get vaccinated.
4025,"Statistically speaking, Covid is a very minor thing for you now, but if an unvaccinated person gets it, that‚Äôs bad news with Delta."
4026,"After winter though, I really do think we‚Äôll be past the worst of this."
4027,"Delta has out-competed every other variant, including the ones that supposedly evaded the vaccines like Mu."

4043,"I disagree, since beginning of pandemic I slept with 4 different girls and kissed with 7."
4044,Still going strong
4045,It totally depends on the variant.
4046,You should have milder symptoms if you get reinfected by the same variant or one very close to it.
4047,Of course it depends on your immune system.
4048,But if it's wildy different variant (beta vs. delta) then you are most likely getting full ride of it again.

4060,It's just a huge bummer.
4061,The issue was they said you don't need masks if you are vaccinated then half of everyone lied about being vaccinated.
4062,Sigh.

4064,Because they have done nothing at all in recent months to prevent the spread of the virus.
4065,Why?

4104,I havnt been on a date since like 6 months before covid really stoped everything here on March 2020
4105,Because we were talking about how the hospitalization and death rates in the UK were much lower comparitively.
4106,The death rate in the UK last year for under 18s was 2 in 1M.
4107,So the vaccination rates among under 18s is irrelevant to accessing overall death rate.
4108,Can people without kids stop being cautious?
4109,Someone in Florida's judicial system is capable of thinking and delivering just rulings!
4110,Wow.
4111," &gt; As the UK have demonstrated, the moment you lift restrictions, cases soar even if a large majority of people are vaccinated."
4112,"We lifted all restrictions in mid-July and cases were generally quite flat for the next three months, it's likely this recent increase is because of the colder weather."

4118,I chose them because it felt like the best option since we had no drive-up sites.
4119,Maybe your area has something similar?
4120,Businesses that enforce restrictions make regular headlines with fights and assaults over the attempted enforcement.
4121,So most have taken a hand's off policy to avoid violent encounters.
4122,And now they get shut down for doing that.

4132,"just to clarify, you're arguing that vaccines make covid worse or that vaccines increase covid hospitalizations?"
4133,&gt;Your hospitalization rates are several times what they were a few months ago.
4134,Hospitalisation rates are roughly the same as in July.

4138,That is not the conclusion I reach.
4139,"I think it seems like vaccinations prevents serious illness, but not infection, which means that Covid 19 will be endemic soon."

4146,[removed]
4147,Everyone I've spoken to who works in public health in Russia has said that the vaccine is widely available there.
4148,So the notion that it's somehow good that people aren't taking it is utterly asinine.
4149,Not to mention straight up inhumane.
4150,An important caveat: Hospitalisations do not follow the trend of increased infection.
4151,"So it seems like various vaccines do a worse job of preventing infection, but still, mostly, prevents serious illness."
4152,Because of the vaccine.
4153,And if we compared YoY there are right around double the amount of people being admitted to the hospital as OCT 2020.
4154,That‚Äôs even worse.
4155,"Things are much worse now than a year ago, that‚Äôs been my point."

4157,Your hospitalization rates are several times what they were a few months ago.
4158,"Each and every one of those people is extremely ill, I would assume."
4159,I can't imagine that you admit healthy people and mild cases to the hospital.
4160,People who have been hospitalized have lung damage and more.
4161,The health of those people is being sacrificed.
4162,"Surviving covid, once it's gone that far, generally means long term disability."
4163,It's not all about death rates.
4164,"But it doesn't affect you personally, so who cares, right?"
4165,"As usual, our timing is really something."
4166,[removed]
4167,why would you compare the hospitalizations during a time period when covid is minimized (though i'm not sure anyone has figured out why those months have less covid) with a time where covid is maximized (though again i'm not sure if there is science yet to explain the cyclical nature)?
4168,why not compare the hospitalization today versus 365 days ago to see the impact?
4169,It was just crazy to me how hateful it was - they were talking about Rachel Levine and it was just pure trans hate.
4170,Disgusting.
4171,You aren't going to get a concrete answer.
4172,"Their previous low, in June, was around 2 admitted per day."

4187,"or something like that, I guess."
4188,"""In a pandemic briefing Tuesday, top health leaders (for Vermont, at a press conference in Montpelier) said roughly 80% of those receiving hospital care for the disease during the past week have been unvaccinated."
4189,"In intensive care units, the percentage during that period is even higher ‚Äî approximately 84% of those being treated were not vaccinated."""
4190,so it appears that the unvaccinated are carrying the team so to speak.
4191,"if you were to vaccinate every vermont adult you'd have 24 people in the hospital, how does that compare with their previous low?"
4192,"if they vaccinated everyone there would be less than 30 people adults in the hospital, how does that compare?"

4194,My opinion for the present is to lock them in their homes to hopefully convince them to get it.

4211,"&gt;Moscow will go into a strict lockdown if coronavirus infections continue to rise, according to a Moscow government order that was sent to businesses in the city Wednesday."
4212,"The order, seen by The Moscow Times, would **close all non-essential stores, including restaurants, stores, museums and parks** as well as **suspend planned medical procedures from Oct. 30-Nov. 7**."
4213,It would come into effect if the total number of new Covid-19 cases in the capital over the next seven days surpasses the number of infections recorded in the previous week.
4214,"President Vladimir Putin earlier Wednesday approved a non-working week from Oct. 30 to Nov. 7 on Wednesday as Russia‚Äôs coronavirus task force reported another daily record of 1,028 Covid-19 deaths over the last 24 hour."
4215,After the vaccine is approved for kids IMHO we should just let it go.

4271,Natural immunity from individuals who have gotten covid have a 27X more protection from the virus than those just vaccinate without prior infection.

4390,What mitigation efforts?
4391,"There is very little correlation between things like sporting events with 60,000+ people and covid spikes."
4392,"Indicating almost all transmission happens indoors, requiring close proximity and physical contact."
4393,"We can't wear masks in our homes, in pubs, in restaurants."
4394,What do you want us to do?
4395,Sounds like 1900 jobs freed up for those who need them.
4396,"I support employers requiring a vaccine, but the article's math is weird...

*Reads article*

92% vaccinated

3% (1,887 workers) quit or were terminated 

3%  (1,927 workers) received an accommodation that allows them to work in a less-public role without being vaccinated

4.6% (""nearly 2,900"") ‚Äî are still in a state of flux."
4397,"meaning they may have more time to get the vaccine, could be retiring, or are waiting to see if they can receive an accommodation."
4398,92 + 3 + 3 + 4.6 is 102.4...
4399,Only about half of doctors take the Hippocratic Oath.

4403,"If we manage to get through Thanksgiving and Christmas with no new surge, and numbers get and stay low through the end of the year, then we should basically be back to 100% normalcy in January, especially if the vaccine is available to all ages at that time."

4424,Mum works in a primary school.
4425,Constantly having new cases crop up but there literally zero mitigation being put in place.
4426,So let's say we got 2 kids in one class test positive.
4427,They rest of the kids don't even need to do a test let alone self isolate.
4428,It's rediculous.
4429,[removed]
4430,Or because the most susceptible people are already dead.
4431,Good bot
4432,"Because it‚Äôs Reddit I didn‚Äôt read the link, but the headline stats you posted are interesting because without thinking it immediately looks like ‚Äúoh no, only 12.5% of cases were milder‚Äù which goes against the conventional wisdom that you should be better protected."
4433,But it of course doesn‚Äôt account for what initial level all of those people has it in the first place.
4434,"Like if 70% of people had a mild case in the first place, then they may not even realise they got reinfected because they wouldn‚Äôt have likely got tested in the first place"

4438,"There are so many that disagree, unfortunately."

4475,This was before the pandemic.
4476,Anti-vaxxers have no place in health care.
4477,Period.
4478,China is also a totalitarian middle income country with resources.
4479,Even with a wannabe dictator in charge Brazil has a fraction of the resources China has.
4480,India even with a populist wannabe is disorganized at the best of times.

4485,Of fucking COURSE.
4486,What did the UK think would happen with unchecked spread?
4487,Why is anyone allowing flights out of the UK?
4488,The UK is going to erase the worlds progress.
4489,"Yeah, every person infected is an opportunity to increase tenfold so the larger the population the worse it would get."

4496,Yeah I got mine yesterday.
4497,I don't know why I have such a bad reaction.
4498,I thought my body was familiar with Covid already.
4499,Wish more people would just see how other governments are performing in their own states compare to Newsom.

4509,"We can get flu shots too, but flu shots are only so effective, especially with reduced immune response."
4510,[removed]
4511,And they have 6 *times* the amount of people in the hospital as they did over the summer.
4512,Clearly the higher rates correlate with more sick people.
4513,"But screw those sick people, right?"
4514,Understandable and thank you for sharing.
4515,"First, for peace of mind, children are the least vulnerable population when it comes to SARS-CoV-2."
4516,"Every country, state, county data point shows this."
4517,"Not knowing your situation, perhaps your children have underlying medical conditions and the fear is warranted, but otherwise please be at peace."
4518,This just isn't affecting kids.
4519,It's something like 600 fatalities and only 20 without underlying conditions in the whole U.S.
4520,"Tragic to be sure, but not something to be afraid of."
4521,Breakthrough infections can occur.
4522,Something to understand is that the claim of the vaccines have therapeutic effects (meaning they minimize severe infection and possibly even prevent infection leading to mild cases) seems to be bearing out in the data.
4523,The UK data shows this to be the case.
4524,Even noted vaccine efficacy skeptics admit this if they're being honest (see Dr. RollerGator).
4525,"From what the data seems to be showing, some in the most vulnerable populations (elderly, folks with severe underlying conditions, etc.)"
4526,remain vulnerable even after vaccination.

4543,"Lost the baby, and died 14 days later."
4544,Not vaccinated.
4545,Hospitalization and death is a much better benchmark.
4546,Add to data with vaccine boosters and that we may unfortunately be approaching herd immediately due to community spread.
4547,I think the Christmas holidays and cold temperatures may create one more big Covid wave but it will likely only hurt unvaccinated communities and at this point I say fuck em.
4548,This has happened before and it will happen again.
4549,It's a 7 day average.
4550,I bet it was because of lower weekend data.
4551,"Mask indoors in public, otherwise everything is the same."
4552,Got my flu shot already.

Washington mandated his troops be vaccinated against smallpox."

4582,Seriously you're so late.
4583,Y'all really don't have a leg to stand on and the rest of us know it.
4584,This aside from the argument's medical and ethical reasons which were settled a LONG time ago.
4585,Ever wonder why in the old days people had so many kids?
4586,Disease killed more kids before adulthood than not.
4587,Those days are mostly gone due to vaccines &amp; hygiene.
4588,So many seem to have forgotten this...
4589,I think there will be fresh candidates on the ballot
4590,I believe the guidance is to wear a mask for 3-5 days and then get tested.
4591,No need to quarantine or anything unless you develop symptoms or test positive.

4615,"US is still clocking 1500+ deaths a day and we are literally pretending its not happening so we can ""get back to work"" or whatever capitalist shine you want to put on mass death."
4616,Listening to that particular politician for sure is a bad idea.
4617,"This isn't my area of expertise (I do have a degree in genetics but immunology wasn't something I went into much depth on when I was still a biologist), but the second article seems to be proposing mucosal inoculation as an alternative to intramuscular, and doesn't make claims about how long-lived the response would be."
4618,"It seems to be proposing ""further research"" rather than making any strong claims."
4619,"The first one is just a news article and you conspicuously skipped the paragraph following your quote:

&gt;There‚Äôs no reason to believe that intranasal vaccines would block all infection either, but experts say they could do a better job than existing vaccines, by better protecting mucus membranes of the nose and throat."

4667,"This is why I am always hesitant about very restrictive laws being put into place, we all know that the vaccine are very effective at helping with serious illness, however, with all vaccines there is still chance of spreading."
4668,That is why I do not like people berating those who are unvaccinated since some have probably been infected before and therefore have more of an immunity than those vaccinated as recent studies show.
4669,"But having this opinion gets your downvoted to oblivion if you aren‚Äôt pro-mandates or restrictions for the unvaccinated, for whatever the reason they choose to be."

4679,"Are you saying that it'll be normal for the US to have lets say 100K cases per day for extended periods of time into the future, year in and year out?"
4680,I sure hope you're very very wrong on that.
4681,I don't see how allowing transmission to go completely uncontrolled is a good idea.
4682,"Cases equal hospitalizations, deaths, long term implications."
4683,A large number multiplied by fantastic VE is still a significant number.
4684,&gt; because the mortality rate drops.
4685,Mortality is of course lower than prior to vaccines.
4686,"But a lot of people getting sick, even with high VE against death, still means a lot of deaths."
4687,Lets assume current mortality rates remain perpetually and we are unable to control cases counts into the future as you're predicting.
4688,This means a metric shit ton of people dying over time.
4689,"A curve doesn't have to have high peaks, it's all about area under the curve."
4690,Personally I feel we're coming up on some sort of crossroads in regard to case counts.
4691,"We need to see how this Delta wave plays out, but a lot of people with power are now one foot in and one foot out in regard to significance of cases."
4692,"Medical advancements not withstanding, a decision will need to be made."
4693,Eg.
4694,"The CDC can't ask vaccinated people to wear a mask to contain spread, while at the same time telling them that infections are irrelevant."
4695,We're not fucking stupid.
4696,[removed]
4697,"We don't know enough to say that this is the case, just because other viruses can cause a myriad of long term symptoms too, doesn't mean that those caused by COVID are the same or that there isn't reason to beware."
4698,"Because of the nature of COVID, affecting cardiovascular tissue (endothelial cells are the primary expresser of ACE2 where it performs the function of regulating blood flow as part of the angiotensin-renin system) and uncertainties regarding the direct impact of viral binding to receptor sites or effects related to immunological or inflammatory responses or cellular damage during an infection, we can't say at all that it's isn't reason to stay home."
4699,"If it turned out that 10 or 20 years down the line the majority of those exposed to COVID became unwell with cardiovascular disease, that people started having strokes or blood clots, or that it affected gene expression or caused cancer, then we'd be absolutely fucked and it would be too late, especially if there were treatments that could have eradicated it or approaches that gave greater freedom with less risk, for example with better testing and tracing or stricter but shorter and more effective lockdowns, we would all regret immensely our haste and the decisions taken by governing bodies."
4700,This is pretty much bullshit.
4701,Eastern European countries have in most cases pretty robust healthcare and social security.
4702,They will not hesitate to take sick leave when needed (and they do as proven by EU stats).
4703,[removed]
4704,This is one of the major questions.
4705,"From what we do know, 3-4 weeks is shorter than average for a second dose."
4706,"Additionally, in other countries which spaced doses out further, we don't have a great data picture on if/when they will need boosters."
4707,"That being said, the 3-4 week turn around was undeniably the right decision (hands down)."
4708,"With no protection, 65+ were dying at an alarming rate, the virus was spreading throughout the majority of the population, etc."
4709,Extending things out by even a few additional months to study increased time between doses would have had devastating consequences.
4710,Go get a booster?
4711,In every study of hospitalization when you break the demographics down you get higher efficacy in each group individually than the entire group has as a whole.

WASHINGTON (AP) ‚Äî ""U.S. regulators expect to rule Wednesday on authorizing booster doses of the Moderna and Johnson &amp; Johnson COVID-19 vaccines, a Food and Drug Administration official said at a government meeting."
4759,"The FDA's Doran Fink previewed ‚Äúsome announcements later today,‚Äù which were expected to include allowing the mixing and matching of COVID-19 booster doses among the three U.S. manufacturers ‚Äî Pfizer, Moderna and J&amp;J. Fink appeared at a meeting of vaccine experts convened by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, who are expected to take up the FDA decisions and make their own recommendations on Thursday."
4760,Several million Americans already have gotten a third shot to boost Pfizer‚Äôs COVID-19 vaccine.
4761,"Last week, the FDA's panel of independent experts unanimously recommended broadening the booster campaign to include recipients of the two-dose Moderna vaccine and J&amp;J's one-shot vaccine."
4762,Most experts also agreed that using a different booster brand appeared safe and effective for revving up protection.
4763,"The FDA is not required to follow the group's advice, though it generally does."
4764,"‚ÄúFDA has been very busy since last Friday wrapping up our review and working toward authorization‚Äù of the vaccine applications, said Fink, a deputy director in the FDA‚Äôs vaccine division."

4783,This is weird because other papers have found there are regulatory genes on the Y chromosome that impact the immune system.
4784,Ironically enough it‚Äôs related to why females have the majority of autoimmune diseases.
4785,Partly because of the chromosome difference the same sex hormones can sometimes activate different genes.

4874,"Mask wearing (once vaccines are available, which they aren't yet for 5-11) is entirely based on case rates and the desire not to have high exponential growth when case counts are already high."
4875,The point of vaccinating kids is to both stop spread and reduce the few amounts of illness that they will have.
4876,Was there a timeline?
4877,I could see them requiring them throughout flu season which ends in like Jan/Feb.
4878,"To mitigate all three flu, rsv and COVID  spiking in kids at the same time this season."

5073,Am I somehow cooler because I at some point put my sex piece into or around someone else's sex piece?
5074,Is the number of partners I've had or number of times I've had intercourse with those partners a vital piece of information that dictates my value to society or the amount of wealth or social stature I should have?
5075,Instead of getting mad at me because I pointed out you used a logical fallacy you should step back and understand what it was that made your argument weak and fallacious.
5076,You can learn from information given to you instead of being angry that you were called out.
5077,You ***could*** say that you understand mandates have been proven to increase vaccination rates and that you understand vaccinated people have an objectively lower risk of contracting and dying from COVID but you still feel it's morally questionable or wrong.
5078,That's a valid standpoint even if it is one with which I disagree.
5079,I manage a restaurant in an area where there is a mask mandate.
5080,"My boss, the owner, told us he didn't want us to enforce it because he didn't want us to have to deal with unruly customers."
5081,"""Just put up the signs and ignore people who don't do it."""
5082,"The employees universally said, ""Fuck that."
5083,"Allow us to enforce it or we quit."""
5084,So we enforce it.
5085,"And if anybody gives them shit for enforcing it, I throw them out and tell them not to come back."
5086,I can count on one hand the number of unruly customers we have had since the mask mandate was reinstated a few months ago.
5087,"We don't yet have a vaccine mandate and I don't expect our county to enact one, but I have already been told by the majority of the staff that they will insist on it being enforced or they will quit."

5194,"Yes, the vaccine is available."
5195,"However, from what I've heard, there were times when they were having trouble making the second shot (since it is different from the first one)."
5196,The thing is that (in my experience) Russians don't generally trust any Russian-made medications and in general aren't as likely to take medications as people in the west.
5197,I \_think\_ you are right that there would have been a shortage at one time (and may have been).
5198,What no one seems to mention is that the Russian government's infection and death numbers have been super unreliable (like the St. Petersburg infection numbers were exactly the same every single day for a while).
5199,It was impossible to tell how bad it was here.

5313,Shake shack and five guys are vastly different price points than in n out.
5314,[deleted]
5315,Im sorry that last bit is totally incorrect.
5316,This time last year Delta didn't exist and is now the predominant variant in the UK.
5317,Cases have been substantially higher than last year and have been roughly in line with the cases the UK had back in January since July.
5318,But deaths/hospitalizations while rising have not risen nearly as fast as before.
5319,"Their deaths used to average like 1,200 7DA with similar case rates and for the past 3 or so months its been much lower with the 7DA being at its highest point in September at 143 7DA."
5320,And bear in mind January they were in hard lockdown and today it's zero restrictions.
5321,I think it's quite clear that vaccines have dramatically reduced deaths/hospitalizations in the UK just like it has here in the US and elsewhere.
5322,Had it not been for vaccines the UKs deaths/hospitalizations would likely be much much higher now.
5323,Vaccines clearly work and saves lives.
5324,Had the UK had Delta in fact had the entire world had Delta last year then cases/deaths would of been far far worse.
5325,Our deaths here in the US would of probably been double had Delta arrived pre vaccines considering how much more transmissible it is
5326,[removed]
5327,There are sufficient idiots who pay a doctor to discard the dose and give them a certificate.
5328,I know a Russian couple who live in Germany that were vaccinated there.
5329,"They went to Russia and organised the certificate without vaccination as they didn't want to be cross vaccinated, i.e."
5330,combing BionTech with Sputnik.
5331,"Most people here just go to a green corridor (a public place where you can get vaccinated - it can be a hospital, a mall, a park, etc.)"
5332,"and just get vaccinated right there, right now."
5333,We need no appointments and we make no appointments.
5334,Same.
5335,We're in the dark together.
5336,I'm going to get all choked up when little one receives his.
5337,I‚Äôm just seeing this lol.
5338,My man got downvoted to Mordor lmao
5339,Over all the hospital takes responsibility but if the person knew they had covid and didn't follow protocol then there would be punishment as well.
5340,"Moderna for everything haha, it keeps holding up in everything from studies to anecdotal stories my hospital friends tell me."
5341,I agree.
5342,"We need a national, federal system about this that works the same everywhere."
5343,"The problem is that conspiracy theorists won't wear masks, get vaccinated, or abide by lockdowns so they're not going to go along with this either."
5344,"Any solution we come up with requires that the vast majority of people are reasonable, and sane, and lucid."
5345,They aren't.
5346,"So if there is a good solution, I don't know what that is."

5348,"If there was an in-n-out in my area, I‚Äôd happily not go to it."
5349,When you go to get your vaccine.
5350,Personally I believe that the Russian Sputnik vaccines are somewhat effective.
5351,They are vector vaccines rather than mRNA so analogous to Astrazenica but perhaps not quite as effictive.
5352,The problem is that the Russians have spent so much time undermining Western vaccines and most Russians believe there own version must be worse so if they hear of problems then they should stay clear.
5353,"Also, if natural immunity declines to the point where the average joe would be reinfected on average every 16 months, then you'd guess with the vaccines (or at least the currently available ones) people'd need a booster roughly every 16 months or so?"
5354,"Yes, it‚Äôs part of the two year trial."
5355,"They periodically take blood to check antibody levels and to see if you were exposed to the virus, they can differentiate vaccine generated antibodies from the virus antibodies."
5356,Yes.
5357,This is what my father's doctor says.
5358,He's in the she group where it's advised.
5359,Really wish Pfizer would update us on the trials of the under 5's and a new timeline.
5360,I support this and it's long overdue.
5361,"I disagree that 200 deaths a day (and likely due to rise) is reasonably low, especially as cases rise and it climbs."
5362,Also long covid is going to effect tens of thousands.

5364,We have over 6 million people living here.
5365,A LOT of immigrants.
5366,The ACT has less than half a million - almost all college educated.
5367,Sydney will likely end up as the most vaccinated major city in the world.
5368,Stop making up silly stories.
5369,"I just entered a popular California theme park that required proof of vaccination, and the person just barely glanced at it and didn't even ask for my ID."
5370,\*shrug\*.
5371,I imagine that forging one is not too hard.

5373,ESP in California
5374,Awesome thanks
5375,Is Christianity not the belief that Jesus Christ was the son of god and the messiah?
5376,"Because if so, then Mormons are very much Christian, just as Catholics, Protestants, Jehovah‚Äôs, etc."
5377,I never understood this.
5378,"I grew up Mormon and got really tired of constantly having to explain how my religion was very much Christian, and how we studied both the old and new testaments extensively."
5379,"We referred to ourselves as Christians, we all had the wwjd bracelets in youth classes and stuff, and even though we and catholics obviously disagreed, we as an organization kind viewed them as our homies."
5380,"Hearing ‚ÄúMormons aren‚Äôt Christians‚Äù I‚Äôm used to, but I‚Äôm massively surprised to learn that anyone would say that of catholics."
5381,"""Please seek help for your apparently severe depression that causes you to push for the removal of restrictions on Reddit support subs."
5382,There are effective treatments for depression that can help you avoid sinking further into the style of thinking we see in the covid subreddit.
5383,"I hope you are able to find effective treatment, it doesn‚Äôt have to be this way."
5384,"I really believe that people can overcome any type of extremism or online radicalization."""
5385,lightly edited from /u/sprintervan567 who seems to give good advice to others.
5386,"All politicians should be required, along with everyone else."
5387,"So if I'm J&amp;J I should go for Moderna, right?"
5388,Need to wait for CDC.
5389,Could potentially get boosters as soon as this weekend according to the NYT article.
5390,The government stockpiles vaccines regardless.
5391,It's part of proper emergency response plan.
5392,"Keep in mind, we can produce 28M doses in days at this point."
5393,Especially 10mcg.
5394,I'm sorry but it costs about $50 to get a certificate without the vaccine.
5395,They have to ask why people want to pay so much to avoid vaccination.
5396,"Do you also have ""ineffective government, a colonial overlord, crumbling infrastructure, a crime wave, and trashed economy?"""
5397,Cause PR does.
5398,And the $4 billion Congress promised after Maria still hasn't been released as far as I can tell.
5399,"it's not gonna hit 99% though, is it."
5400,and why would that be.
5401,Who are overwhelming likely to be vaccinated in the UK
5402,To a degree yes but we have issues like racism so they can't be completely free.
5403,Also we have states like Texas which is blocking from businesses in the other direction.
5404,What is vaccine appointments?
5405,Didn't they just say last week that the government had ruled out a lockdown?
5406,is this as part of the trial?
5407,Holy shit.
5408,"For a nation less than half the population of America, that's crazy high."
5409,So are all j and j recipients eligible for a booster now if we are 2 months  out?
5410,Or do we need to wait for further approval?
5411,"Yeah, seasonality is huge for respiratory viruses and Russia (being so far north and cold) gets theirs earlier than most places in the northern hemisphere."
5412,[removed]
5413,"Well, the path they go down also has negative implications."
5414,This sends a single what kind of company In-N-Out is and will impact my decision in the future.
5415,"Firstly masks in public spaces, on public transport..also workers who can work from home should stay at home..no going into the city unless absolutely necessary."
5416,How is that for starters smarty pants or is that an infringement of your human rights?
5417,Probably never!
5418,"By your same argument, every time an employee tells someone to put shoes on they are putting themselves at risk of retaliation."
5419,The doctor not reason people are getting so worked over covid restrictions is politics.
5420,If Trump would‚Äôve told people choosing to wear shoes is there god given right we‚Äôd be in the same situation
5421,"By that logic, no law that keeps society safe should exist."
5422,"Based on your logic, here are some examples:

1) Passenger belongings should not be checked before getting on a plane, it will upset customers

2) Flight tickets and ID should not be checked to get on a plane, because it will upset customers

3) Age should not be verified to serve alcohol, because it will offend customers

4) Credit score should not be checked in order to get a loan, because it will offend customers

5)  Background checks should not be carried out, cause it will offend potential employees

All the checks above are meant to keep society safe, and exist because of irresponsible and misbehaving citizens."
5423,"Such checks are in place because of misbehaving customers, not the other way around."
5424,You have a serious causality flaw in your logic.
5425,"Law's don't get created out of thin air, they get created because people misuse their liberties."
5426,"I think SF, Alameda County and Contra Costa County all have the mandate."
5427,"I've been checked in SF, Oakland and Berkeley but it isn't consistent."
5428,Santa Clara county might have it too but I'm not sure.
5429,"Turns out the ""rugged individualism"" of America was a myth all along."
5430,Most of us couldn't make it a week without the conveniences we've grown accustomed to having.
5431,I mean it would make sense and explain the UK cases.
5432,Pretty much everyone saw a delta spike and then a drop in cases.
5433,The U.K. didn‚Äôt so this would be the explanation for it.
5434,I‚Äôd have*
5435,I live in Australia.
5436,and I'm telling you we do have a choice.
5437,"BC actually, in the rural part, which may as well be Alberta."
5438,"This keeps getting repeated, but is based on outdated data."
5439,"This month, hospitalizations and deaths in the UK are indeed following case surges."
5440,their excess deaths is much higher recent two years.
5441,Around 600k excess deaths.
5442,This is getting absolutely ridiculous.
5443,Last year lots of businesses closed because they couldn‚Äôt adapt to entering a pandemic.
5444,Now we have places closing because they refuse to adapt to getting out of it.
5445,"When our county reimposed an indoor mask mandate, they set an automatic trigger to lift the mandate, which we're getting close to."
5446,Let's see if they change their minds or not.
5447,"They shouldn't, the statistics should be based on vaccine appointments, not people turning in a certificate."
5448,"Fair, I do think we still have far more research, I am just saying that is why I am hesitant for strict laws like that."
5449,We don‚Äôt know enough yet and to make laws against unvaccinated seem harsh to me.
5450,But we shall see.
5451,Exactly.
5452,I hope you are right in that people are eventually willing to assume a certain risk in relation to covid when they are clearly willing to do so in relation to so many other issues.
5453,What concerns me is that it has not happened yet...

5618,Many take walk-ins.
5619,Many will still give you a shot without ID.
5620,Alternatively you can get it in an adjacent state and tell your parents that it must be fraud or something.
5621,Your pharmacy cannot tell your parents you've been vaccinated.
5622,Neither can your health insurance provider.
5623,"Assuming you're an adult, that is."
5624,It would be illegal.
5625,Your health records are your own.
5626,"You'll be given a vaccine card that your parents don't need to know about, and that's it."
5627,Places with poor healthcare infrastructure know their systems need an aggressive vaccine strategy if they want to avoid what they faced earlier in the pandemic.
5628,The pandemic hit a lot of Indian reservations like the Navajo and Hopi very hard in the southwest before vaccines rolled out.

5639,You hear about people walking for miles...waiting in lines for days...all to get vaccinated.
5640,I think we're all realizing that covid is part of life now.
5641,"Many of my fully vaccinated friends have caught it and all were mild, so that alleviates a ton of fear for them and for anyone around them."
5642,We're seeing that vaccinations work.
5643,"So we didn't get lucky and discover they cause total immunity but that was a long shot anyway, but they make it possible for us to feel kinda crappy for a few days like with a cold but we can still function."
5644,Normal never stays regular-- I'm 53 and I have to tell you that shit constantly evolves.
5645,This is my first pandemic but there's always something terrifying going on that could directly affect your life and the lives of those you love...and it's always expectedly unexpected.
5646,We'd been warned for years that a pandemic was headed our way but there's no way to prepare.
5647,Before this there was swine flu and zika and SARS and terrorists and anthrax and mail bombs and serial killers on the loose and carjackers and skyjackers and kidnappers and AIDS and anyone who listened to heavy metal and chicken pox and hong kong flu--just in my lifetime.

5731,"We are all healthy, active, thin, mid-late 20s."
5732,"2 of us are vaccinated 
2 of us have natural immunity from previous COVID 
1 girl unvaccinated, never had COVID 

We did normal tourist activities each day."
5733,"By Day 3, the unvaxxed/never-COVID girl was SICK af."
5734,She got progressively worse until she could barely walk 10 feet without struggling for breath.
5735,"(She is also the most fit of all of us and is a health freak, eats all her veggies daily, drinks green juice, etc)."
5736,"Low and behold, she had COVID."
5737,The rest of us were freaking out despite being vaxxed and having previous infection.
5738,We still stayed in the same Airbnb with her for the remainder of trip (but let her have her own room instead of sharing).
5739,We all tested and re-tested for covid and none of us ever got sick.
5740,We were totally fine.
5741,She ended up staying in the Airbnb for another 2 weeks until she tested negative.
5742,(She didn‚Äôt want to travel sick).
5743,The rest of us stayed a few more days to make sure and we never got sick either.
5744,Our vaccines and previous infection clearly worked and our immune systems were prepared.
5745,So that‚Äôs my anecdote and why I made the conclusion that your healthy friend must not have a great immune system if she was vaxxed + previous infection.
5746,It directly negates my experience.

190 million Americans have received the covid vaccine."

5767,"On the other hand, the World Health Organization estimates that [between 10% and 20%](https://www.who.int/news-room/events/detail/2021/10/06/default-calendar/expanding-our-understanding-of-post-covid-19-condition-web-series-rehabilitation-care) of people who are infected with covid will experience persistent symptoms ""irrespective of initial disease severity"" -- what people informally call ""long-covid""."
5768,It's OK to be anxious about the vaccine.
5769,"It's OK to be anxious about the risk of side effects, even if they're incredibly rare and unlikely to happen to you."
5770,"But you need to recognize that you're not choosing between a scary thing and a safe thing -- you're choosing between a very slightly scary thing (the risk of covid vaccine side effects) and a much, much scarier thing (the risk of getting covid, and either ending up in hospital, or having persistent, potentially life-altering symptoms)."

5786,"But when people don't get the vaccine and get covid, they clog up our hospital systems."
5787,My guess is if they all decided not to use hospital resources then it would be better.
5788,Ohhhh right women get abortions to save themselves from dying in childbirth....yep
5789,Yep and all those people who were against testing then started begging for it back before they got terminated.

5942,They probably removed the restrictions later than the UK(I guess).
5943,And I actually read today that the Netherlands (and others) are getting worse again in terms of Corona and are actually on the high side of Europe.
5944,A short Google right now says the same.
5945,Netherlands is not doing too well in terms of corona.
5946,"&gt;As coronavirus cases spurred by the delta variant wane across much of the country, states with cold weather are showing a rise in new coronavirus infections, according to Washington Post data."
5947,"&gt;Alaska is leading the low-temperature states with an increase in the number of infections, with 123 new cases per 100,000 residents on a seven-day rolling average."
5948,"Montana, Wyoming, Idaho and North Dakota also are seeing a rise in infections as the weather cools, reducing opportunities to socialize outdoors and limiting physical distancing."
5949,&gt;States in the northeastern region of the country also have experienced an increase in infection numbers over the past seven days.
5950,"New Hampshire, Illinois, Massachusetts, Connecticut and Rhode Island have recorded increases in infections, according to Post data."
5951,The data mirrors trends of last fall and winter when new-case numbers diminished in Southern states that were hit hard by the virus before it devastated colder-weather states.
5952,"&gt;Overall, new daily reported infection numbers fell by more than 6 percent in the past week along with the number of covid-related hospitalizations, which dropped by nearly 9 percent, according to Post data."
5953,"&gt;On Sunday, Anthony S. Fauci, the nation‚Äôs top infectious-disease expert, said the downward trend can continue if the nation does well in getting more people vaccinated."
5954,"Mutations aren't uncommon... with a healthy immune system, hopefully the only thing that happens is that the virus I weakened, prior to passing it on, as the body can tear in to it and keep it from prospering or festering."
5955,"With an ""untrzined"" immune system, viruses may often evade detection for longer periods of time, and the immune system slow to adapt, given it more chance of developing a mutation that ""learns"" from the weak immune system trying to kill it."
5956,"So, effectively, it maybe come stronger, or more virile, or more deadly, or any number of other ""helpful"" mutations that allow it to spread."
5957,"And coronavirus has proven to bea *particularly elusive* little thing, this far."

5964,"&gt;At least 65,000 more men died of covid-19 than women in the United States by the end of August, according to a study by the Brookings Institution."
5965,"&gt;While the disproportionate impact of this pandemic on men has already been recorded, this study released Tuesday uses the latest data from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to quantify that gap, which it said was most pronounced among middle-aged adults."
5966,"It finds that, while age remains the main risk factor for covid-19 mortality, the gender gap is important and caused by ‚Äúa combination of factors, which may differ by race, class, geography and other variables.‚Äù

&gt;Men overall were 1.6 times likelier to die of the disease caused by the coronavirus than women, the study said."
5967,"Since March however, when vaccination became widespread in the United States, the gap in deaths between men and women has narrowed in some age groups, it said."
5968,"The CDC recorded 362,187 male deaths and 296,567 female deaths between Feb. 2020 and end of August this year."
5969,"&gt;Race was an important risk factor, with the study authors citing a previous finding that ‚ÄúBlack and Hispanic or Latino death rates are six times higher than those for white people.‚Äù

&gt;They call on policymakers to focus on inoculating ‚Äúthe most vulnerable groups,‚Äù including ‚Äúmen, and especially Black men‚Äù ‚Äî a recommendation that is not without its challenges, given socio-economic factors including barriers to health care access for many people of color."
5970,Black Americans were 1.2 times less likely than their White counterparts to have received at least one dose of a coronavirus vaccine in a recent Kaiser Family Foundation analysis.

5981,"The COVID vaccines reduce the likelihood of hospitalization and death, but transmission is still a very big issue for which both vaccinated and unvaccinated individuals are responsible."
5982,Discrimination on the basis of a vaccine whose efficacy vs delta is compromised and whose clinical trials are ongoing is not okay.

5984,what does this have to do with eric wareheim and that other guy?
5985,"Yes, yes we do."
5986,Yeah if people feel comfortable asking about vaccine status we should normalize asking about STD testing.
5987,Define ‚Äúhighly vaccinated‚Äù though.
5988,With a virus that ostensibly requires 90-95% vaccination rates it‚Äôs hard to say that anywhere is really highly vaccinated right now.

&gt;Two doses of mRNA vaccines were 74.7% effective against infection among nursing home residents early in the vaccination program (March‚ÄìMay 2021)."
6024,"During June‚ÄìJuly 2021, when B.1.617.2 (Delta) variant circulation predominated, effectiveness declined significantly to 53.1%."

6078,The latest 7 day average for hospitalisation is 848.1.
6079,"You're correct about this being an \~800% increase, but it isn't an increase to a level of ""oh my god, red alert, we're about to collapse""."

6093,"For example, Vermont's 14-day case average is +38% but their 14-day hospitalization average is -5%."
6094,So the expectation when they dropped was higher then they turned out to be?
6095,"So that would mean the other guy was right, they aren't performing quite to what we expected, not that they aren't still good, they are."

6104,"you mean shoving them back into overcrowded schools to watch teachers, staff, and even classmates die isn't great?"

6132,"You definitely can make comparisons with flu, especially as we enter endemic stages."
6133,What should comparisons be made to if not other contagious respiratory illnesses?
6134,Just because there are differences in transmissibility and severity doesn't render comparisons on the general behaviour of the two useless.

6156,"If the FDA approved vaccine (Pfizer) falls to 50% in 6 months (for the sake of the discussion, let's imagine this is true), wouldn't booster shots for everyone need to be mandatory to ensure herd immunity?"

6248,subtract those off and vermont's numbers aren't rising at all.
6249,That data is incredibly outdated.
6250,"Recent studies have shown young unvaccinated children are safer than ANY vaccinated adult age group, not just (or equal) with the elderly."
6251,"Vermont has 70% of their total population, and 95% of their eligible population vaccinated."

6253,What are your thoughts regarding the dropping efficacy of the vaccine?
6254,"CNN reported that in a study of 600,000 veterans, the Pfizer vaccine's efficacy dropped to 50%...are boosters required for the majority of the population to obtain this herd immunity?"
6255,"""The researchers found that among more than 600,000 veterans, J&amp;J's vaccine's protection fell from 88% in March to 3% in August."

6277,What's that mean?

6326,They have 1 in 12 high school students positive for Covid this week in England.
6327,"So the lesson from the UK is, you can't totally lift restrictions with kids and teenagers totally unvaccinated, but especially teens, who are as contagious as adults and gathering in larger groups, and not as likely to socially distance."

6366,And the COVID shot is WAY better than the Flu shot.
6367,Just because you test positive for the virus doesn't mean you're ill with Covid.
6368,If a dictatorship told you to breathe would you refuse?
6369,"Your other issue is that many that have had, or believe they had, covid may think they cannot get it again or believe they will fight it off like last time."

6486,"The immune system might already have some floating antibodies, and presumably has memory B- and T-cells."

6932,I read that Taiwan has slightly more covid deaths from the vaccine than covid since well COVID barely spread there with only around 16000 documented cases total while somewhere around 22 million jabs.
6933,Not sure if the cases were pre or post vaccination but it appears mostly prevaccination.
6934,If you take these numbers it would make around 1300 jabs riskier than a covid case (likely worse than this for youngsters).
6935,I mean even with the few restrictions of USA's covid prevention only around 1 in 8 have got COVID over 2 years (the amount of time 4 covid boosters would cover).
6936,To do 33 times better than the USA in preventing the spread of covid is not unrealistic especially since such measures work with an order of magnitude.
6937,An initial jab probably gives a fair amount of long term immunity too which would only decrease the helpfulness of boosters and well subsequent boosters are likely not going to be any less risky.

6952,"But you may also get it after 3, or 10, or even 61 according to the study."

7150,Most people stating natural immunity point to this [pre-print paper from Israel](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.08.24.21262415v1) touting that previously infected are less likely to encounter a reinfection than the vaccinated.
7151,"Overall the paper is decent but it has a few NOTABLE issues that almost certainly impacted the results (reducing the numbers of reinfections):

1."
7152,"While they attempted to standardize for age, health factors, sex, etc."
7153,there are still notable problems with the cohorts.
7154,"For example, people that die from their first infection (such as the immunocompromised) are often those the most likely to experience a breakthrough infection with a vaccine."
7155,This selection-bias of the populations studied inherently biases against the vaccinated group when it comes to breakthrough infections.
7156,2.
7157,Anyone who was vaccinated at ANY point in the study were dropped from the trial cohorts.
7158,This is a notable issue because it reduces the number of infections in the unvaccinated cohort.
7159,"For example, someone who got infected twice and changed their mind about vaccination are no longer are counted."
7160,3.
7161,"Most importantly, the likelihood to get tested (and as a result get counted as a positive) when showing symptoms is significantly higher amongst those who get vaccinated."
7162,Those who have already had it are seldom likely to get tested again.
7163,"Quite simply, more controlled studies (such as this one:[Nature, October 14, 2021](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-021-01548-7)) which utilize mandatory periodic COVID testing on large cohorts show ""The effectiveness of two doses remains **at least** as great as protection afforded by prior natural infection."""

7584,When will the UK be able to vaccinate 85% of its population?
7585,What does that even mean?
7586,"It is a fact that a statistical percentage of people are going to die from COVID - the percentage is far lower if fully vaccinated, but is still not nil."

7779,&gt;Mayor Bill de Blasio announced on Wednesday that New York City will require all municipal workers‚Äîincluding first responders such as firefighters and police officers‚Äîto get at least one vaccine dose by October 29th.
7780,Are politicians and their staff required to be vaccinated as well?
7781,Yes.
7782,I'm OK with dying on this hill
7783,Yes
7784,"You just made me feel lucky (had Covid in December,  fatigue lingered for a month, no other side effects, got vaccinated)."
7785,I'm from Eastern Europe.
7786,Slovakia.
7787,Half of the nation are dumb-fucks.
7788,"Sad, but the other half has to live with them."
7789,Only 46% vaccination rate and millions of unused vaciness.
7790,[removed]
7791,"Make number 10% lower, 20 less people die a day."
7792,What's required to do that?
7793,It's not shutting everything down that's almost certain.
7794,Wear masks indoors possibly.
7795,Seems like a small inconvenience for 20 people not to die a day.
7796,Based in-n-out
7797,"Everyone should get vaccinated, children are definitely at risk as well, and we don't yet understand the mechanism in this virus that is stopping people, very vastly the unvaccinated, from developing long term immune response, meaning you can get severely ill over and over, or die (that happens just once usually)."
7798,"At least 10-20% of unvaccinated are unable to or don't develop an immune response months after clearing infection, compared to 1-2% of vaccinated."
7799,"Everyone gets old, everyone eventually gets underlying conditions."
7800,Everyone needs to get vaccinated.
7801,[removed]
7802,Yeah I feel the same.
7803,"I do love In n Out, so this is greatly disappointing to see they are siding with the virus during a worldwide pandemic."
7804,"If they sold beer, they'd have to be the ""government police"" to check IDs."
7805,I'm sick of the idea that a business can just ignore rules they don't like and still be allowed to do business.
7806,"The misinformation here is just... On another level, and with that in mind, i am worried about how this wave will end"
7807,I meant not groundbreaking as in anyone that listens to science knows this already.
7808,Not that it's boring or useless.
7809,This is good news for the vast majority of people that are vaccinated.
7810,They are avoiding the confrontation with their customers.
7811,That is not the same as tolerating violence.
7812,In-N-Out is not making it harder to end the pandemic.
7813,Stupid people are making it harder to end the pandemic.
7814,23 here.
7815,I'm not expecting humanity to make it another 20 years.
7816,"I wonder if it's the click at doomsday bullshit that is thrown in our faces endlessly, or the fact that it's 80¬∞ in late October, but, I'm not optimistic for the future."
7817,I graduated before COVID.
7818,I can't imagine what these kids are feeling nowadays.
7819,All schoolchildren and families with schoolchildren are supposed to be testing 2x per week.
7820,Many jobs are also asking their staff to do 2x a week tests
7821,Religion has zero to do with it.
7822,Christianity does not ban vaccines and as far as I know no other major religion does.
7823,People claiming religious exemptions are creating their own religion to try to claim oppression.
7824,I‚Äôm sorry you don‚Äôt like the answer.
7825,"In the U.S., as you know from your 8th grade civics class, our rights are derived from the constitution and our system of laws."
7826,"Sadly, there is no constitutional right not to live in fear."
7827,"Again, I suggest you blame lawyers for this."
7828,"It‚Äôs not only convenient, it‚Äôs accurate."
7829,Please give me SWEDISH media claiming that out strategy is going for naturally acquired herd immunity rather than misrepresentative American media (which I keep pointing out is the issue..).
7830,"And besides, neither of those mentions it being the Swedish strategy."
7831,"Someone claiming that the effects of natural herd immunity slows infection (which it does) and someone saying ""our countries strategy is going to consist of no restrictions, let people catch the disease and develop natural herd immunity as our sole way of combating the virus"" is not the same thing."
7832,"So, I was trending before covid started?"
7833,Cases are of secondary importance to serious diseases and hospitalizations
7834,Call me when they refuse to be the immigration police and stop asking for proof of citizenship or green card.
7835,Sorry about being rude.
7836,I am not christian though.
7837,Was born in a different religion and am an athiest.
7838,I do feel religion is ruining the country as science and religion cannot coexist.
7839,"It happened during the dark ages, and its happening now"
7840,"Uh... Yeah, I'll upvote."
7841,"Does seem to follow the usual ""logic."""
7842,"Redefines the whole ""taking one for the team"" phrase..."
7843,Just like an employee doesn‚Äôt get in trouble for serving alcohol to a minor if the minor presents a realistic looking fake ID showing they are over 21 I wouldn‚Äôt expect an employee to get in trouble for being tricked with a forged vaccination card.
7844,The person using it could be charged with forgery but the employee who is tricked by it would be fine.
7845,"49,139 cases in UK today, that's like 240,000 US cases--UK is about the worst in the Western world and has been for some time--Not sure why this is the case"
7846,"As a Christian, I am lost as to why antivax became a ‚Äúreligious‚Äù thing."
7847,"‚ÄúScrew everybody else, I come first‚Äù is about as far from Christ‚Äôs message as you can get."

7849,"That's pretty much what the article states, it's a safety hazard for their restaurant associates."
7850,Why would it be unsafe to verify vaccines?
7851,Who is making it unsafe?
7852,Obviously the unvaccinated.
7853,"If so, they are clearly tolerating such people and their unsafe behavior, while making it harder to put an end to the pandemic."

7857,Im a Culver's man anyway.
7858,Granted there are no In-N-Outs in the Midwest but still point stands.
7859,"A different kind of casual romance, the kind where your partner isn't your significant other"
7860,Most places in the Bay Area aren't actually bothering to check vaccination status anyways.
7861,Really just the upscale restaurants have been checking.
7862,I'm guessing they are enforcing it on In-N-Out because they are a recognizable brand and are in a touristy location.
7863,The vaccination rate is really high here though so I don't know how much it matters.
7864,In-and-Get-the-Fuck-Out Burgers more like it.
7865,Oof
7866,Absolutely agree.
7867,"I'm surrounded by opposite-minded family that do nothing but complain about this state, but I am so grateful to be living in a place where the governor is not actively trying to kill us."
7868,"Fortunately science isn't about click bait, entertaining findings, blowing our minds."
7869,"Now the unfortunate aspects of research that arise when you force researchers to compete for limited funding and seek approval for funding by getting their published research seen may be a reality, but science itself is often ""boring"", or somewhat predictable, and my hat goes off to the researchers putting in the time to collect and verify data that's not sexy."
7870,[removed]
7871,And onto some bullets.
7872,Unless one of them fakes a vaccine certificate/card...
7873,[removed]
7874,"So we should be okay if employees just accept any proof of vaccine, real or fake or not theirs?"
7875,"Vaccine cards are a bit different from IDs, which I'm told many don't have or is burden to get one."
7876,"Your other comment was deleted because it was needlessly political and rude, but I'm about as far from conservative as you can get."
7877,"I just think it's silly that Christians like you want to pretend that any shitty Christians ""aren't really Christians,"" when that's not how religion works at all."
7878,"I'm also an atheist, so I don't have any skin in this game."
7879,"Right, go get your ""first shot""."
7880,Chances are you're due for a booster anyway.
7881,Self-damage detected.
7882,Condition: critical.
