0,This is ridiculous.
1,That’s like saying don’t post a pic of your nice vacation or dinner out with a partner because someone can’t afford it and doesn’t have a partner.
2,Just no.
3,The mask restrictions should be the absolute last thing to be lifted.
4,It’s such a minor inconvenience compared to anything else.
5,This is just tripping over the finish line
6,America bad until need $$$
7,... ignore this man and keep wearing your masks.
8,"Not trying to be that guy, but aren't there already mutations that the vaccines don't work on?"
9,No.
10,It’s approved but not due to be delivered until next month I think.
11,No problem.
12,I've been following this since it started.
13,I've seen enough action/reaction in the states to point out the spread is intentional among a significant portion of your neighbors.
14,And it will continue to be.
15,"On one hand, oh joy!"
16,"There's some restaurants over the border that I miss and I'm vaccinated

On the other hand, shit."
17,Texas is gonna inflate our numbers again an Grisham is just gonna tighten down
18,"So the two sides would be:

 it makes you immune but you can still spread covid 

or 

it both makes you immune and stops the spread"
19,"I think ""You still need to stay home after the vaccine"" is misinformation."

21,Right?
22,Mad respect!
23,I kept hearing in other subs about how this place was a doom and gloom bastion of negativity where anyone trying to have hope was shot down.
24,Well i came here and i saw the exact opposite.
25,In some cases maybe things were to far to the other side.
26,Maybe I came after the doom and gloom days.
27,Or maybe I just came after the vaccines came around to save us all.
28,Yes haw?
29,"Look, it's reasonable to have some level of skepticism about large pharma companies."
30,"But the reality is that no company that's been around for nearly a century and a half is going to have not made mistakes, and pharma in particular is a riskier business than most when it comes to potentially harming people."
31,"The wikipedia article itself even mentions that they've been some of the most proactive on recalls and what not, even when they weren't at fault (the Chicago poisonings), so it's clearly a mixed bag with them."
32,"But for what it's worth, I don't think any company is going to want to intentionally do something to violate the public trust with COVID-19 response because literally the entire world is watching their every move right now."
33,Good.
34,I'm excited to go to college.
35,Losing senior year will be worth it if I can just have a normal college experience.
36,"People have decided that since there’s a vaccine, covid no longer matters."
37,Many on this subreddit have been screaming it from the rooftops that they were going to be “done” with covid as soon as the vaccine was released.
38,Makes no sense
39,[removed]
40,About 40 days too soon IMO.
41,"I do know that the severity of disease seems to be linked to your blood type somehow, so maybe that also impacts your reaction to the vaccine?"
42,"Seems weird that it would, but maybe."
43,A coworker of mine lost sense of smell and taste today.
44,She’s not vaccinated; I am.
45,How concerned should I be?
46,Will not be around here and have not without a mask.
47,But I do have an unvaccinated person in my household.
48,This is what Chris Whitty in the UK has stated before.

51,"&gt; We could also design cars that only go 40 mph, that would save lives

You're literally just describing speed limits

I guess this means its only a matter of time before the selfish ""fuck everyone else I wanna do what I want"" crowd tries to get those banned too?!?!"
52,"After all if you don't want to risk being hit by some yahoo going 120, you can just use a safer car or simply not go out if you're too worried, huh?"
53,In my city they plan to have 80s-60s done by July
54,"""2 weeks to flatten the curve"""
55,Who said it was over and done with?
56,The goal is to open up when hospitals arent overwhelmed.
57,I don’t know where people are getting this idea that the goal was to open up when things are over
58,Did you do your math right?
59,The second dose is taken 3 weeks after the first dose.
60,So elderly hugging their grandchildren two weeks after the second dose would be 35 days days since initiating vaccination
61,"So the two sides would be:

 it makes you immune but you can still spread covid 

or 

it both makes you immune and stops the spread"
62,"'The COVID HOLIDAY SPECIAL!"""

70,It’s not fucking rocket science.
71,"In Australia all the bars are constantly packed, it's wonderful but also kinda sucks bc it takes forever to get in now."
72,"Even the most covid-cautious people I know are starting to be done, now that we are hitting the 1 year mark."
73,In Britain there is an invisible force that prevents the elderly from hugging their grandchildren after their second does
74,Isnt that who vaccines are supposed to do?
75,"We in America are going to have to start mentally coping with the idea that America is going to be crippled by Covid for the next several years, even with the vaccine, because several states are actively choosing to allow it to spread and mutate."
76,"Barring some bold change in the federal government's approach, these states will continually set us back and potentially endanger the world with new mutations and uncontrolled spread."
77,[removed]
78,Sigh my shot can’t come soon enough
79,Yea.
80,Sounds like the data from pretty much everywhere is inconsistent and can't be really trusted.
81,"Jeez, you'd think by 2021 we'd be half-way good at this..."
82,[deleted]
83,What a very rational and reasonable position.
84,"We need to be objective, and engage in objective decision-making that involves calculated risks, like in all things."
85,"In the pre-pandemic era, we took risks like driving 1000 miles in the winter to visit family for Christmas."
86,The risk of that was actually pretty high if the weather was bad.
87,"But, we trusted ourselves and one another to make decisions; and those decisions *did* affect one anothers' safety, since more cars on that same road during a snowstorm raises everyone's risk level together, probably exponentially."
88,"I hope they find a very middle-of-the-road and rational way to make their restrictions, and despite the absolute cringeworthyness of the misinformation, I hope they can drop their censorship as soon as it's safe to do so."
89,"Frankly, I think it's more productive to let people say incorrect things and be socially punished for it (and have a hundred people show up to explain to them and to other readers *why* they're wrong) than it is to simply silence them."
90,After US' vaccination campaign is advanced/done by July I hope you guys distribute some spare vaccines to us.
91,With Bolsonaro we're fresh ground for new variant outbreaks that could pose global threats.
92,The saddest part is a lot of the population is stupid enough to support him
93,I haven’t heard anything about a vaccine resistant strain.
94,[removed]
95,"And yet, masks a social distancing have killed off the flu."
96,Funny how the acutal facts work when compared to your sad selfish feelings
97,When it's a year later this is the right move.
98,What we have done has not worked.
99,COVID is still everywhere.
100,Will Texas see a rise in cases in the coming weeks and months?
101,Absolutely.
102,"They will also be the first state back to ""normal"" which at this point doesn't seem to be the goal of anyone else."
103,"Ohhhhh so scary

Give me more jabs and lockdown"
104,Thanks I was so confused about this.
105,But also not having symptoms severely reduces the chance of transmission.
106,And if the transmission rate is low enough the virus will die out eventually
107,China
108,Your post is amazing.
109,We have hospital capacity.
110,We will never go through a surge like the past winter again (barring some unlikely mutation).
111,Hospitals were stretched but not overwhelmed.
112,Other states stayed open and were not overwhelmed.
113,It’s becoming more obvious these interventions are mainly theater.
114,Vaccines are ramping up our immune population.
115,"There is no excuse now with J&amp;J to at the very least publish a roadmap, with dates, to normal."
116,ASAP.
117,By April every day it’s looking increasingly likely vaccine will be public to anyone.
118,[deleted]
119,At the very least it'll provide a good look at what the results will be if other states want to follow suit.
120,Hopeful that it's starting a chain of dominos.
121,"Only administered 67% of their vaccines supplied, lowest rate in the union."

123,me too.
124,next sub will be r/postcovid
125,They already do.
126,They have a new reservation system they said they have no plans to get rid of when Covid ends.
127,That’s especially great to hear when you consider that she was very ready to jail stay at home order violator
128,"Thanks a bunch, **[REDACTED]**."
129,If you haven’t been vaccinated still be careful would suck to catch it this close to being stabbed.
130,But after that?
131,Get back out there and live!!
132,!
133,Soooo how does that jive with county level mandates?
134,Huh?
135,Is that not just expected?
136,What else would be the use?
137,Masks don't work at ALL against the flu.
138,There was well-established scientific consensus on this going back decades.
139,Social mask wearing has long been established as not effective at containing the spread of flu.
140,It doesn't protect yourself or others.
141,"Also, it has also been long established that outbreaks of respiratory viruses aren't driven by asymptomatic people."
142,"Fauci himself said back in the spring that in the long history of virology it has been known that while it is theoretically possible for an asymptomatic person to spread a respiratory virus, outbreaks aren't driven by them."
143,So wearing a mask without symptoms is the equivalent of wearing a condom to sleep alone **just in case**
144,Lol yeah look at all those countries that got it under control last year and no longer have to deal with it or have lockdowns!
145,He must really like making international news
146,I was reading recently about the new Ebola outbreaks in the DRC and Guinea and my aniexty probably got the best of me.
147,It also doesn't help I recently watched the movie Outbreak with Dustin Hoffman.
148,"We've just been through so much shit in the past year, I honestly wouldn't be surpised if nature through something like it at us."
149,"But I know nothing about science or virusues and judging by the amount of downvotes on my comment, alot of people feel the same way as me."
150,Annnnd this is how we got to over half a million dead from Covid-19.

209,So another 6 months and missed summer.
210,Not thanks.
211,&gt;Last we want is the virus to mutate even further and be completely vaccine evasive.
212,You do realize that the virus will still spread around 90% of the world right?
213,Or do you think Biden is going to completely shutdown the borders 100%?
214,So at best case that is 17 million with a level of immunity— that is 58% of the population which is **not close** to the ~70% needed for herd immunity and it will take two whole weeks for some of those 7 million with one shot to get the 70-80% immunity.
215,Again: fully opening up will kill people.
216,It didn't take me long to forget how difficult it is to read trump quotes.
217,He can't string a sentence together without 5 tangents
218,yes
219,Also apparently kids younger than 12 don’t spread covid as effectively and don’t have symptoms as severe.
220,"In Washington, it's open for anyone 50 or older in a multigenerational household and 65+, so everyone in WA 50 to 64 now suddenly lives with their grandkids even if they don't have any."
221,They aren't the end game because the protectiveness against the variant strains is still unknown.
222,You also don't know if you're part of the population that they're effective on or not.
223,"5% ineffective seems like a small amount, except that it's still 5% of a very large number."
224,So the health experts are telling people they should still mask up and social distance even after being fully vaccinated until we basically get to herd immunity.

243,"To my knowledge, only the South African variant has been shown to have some resistance to at least one vaccine, but the vaccines mostly work against that one as well."
244,It does highlight the need to deploly the vaccines quickly.
245,"The less spread, the fewer chances for mutations."
246,&gt; The US having 60% vaccinated isn't going to all of a sudden stop the transmission for the rest of the world.
247,"It would eliminate a large reservoir, making identification and mitigation of variants easier."
248,"If we already had a vaccine for a similar virus when this thing originated, there's a chance we could have had the entire population vaccinated with a modified vaccine before we reached even a hundredth of the current number of deaths."

259,The US has \~209 million adults.

261,That means that there are \~131 million adults who still need the first dose.
262,"At the current rate (of 1.13 million per day for first doses), it would take 115 days to give the remaining adult population 1 dose, which would bring us to June 24th."

285,All restrictions lifted on indoor dining (which was happening with limited capacity but no one was really following the rules) and even the public libraries are now completely re-opening again.
286,All because case numbers have been trending downward for the past 2-3 weeks and we're now vaccinating people who are 65+.
287,As far as the local authorities are concerned the pandemic is over and the populace is happy to go along with them.
288,This feels like the first time since the pandemic started that we actually improved on an original estimate.
289,Great sign and helps improve the optimism that the end is in sight.

291,"Wrong, your biased narrow look at the statistics show that."
292,You can’t even admit you’re wrong even when faced with a large amount of evidence ahahaha god you’re a monkey 🐵
293,Why do people like you always do lowest common denominator reasons for reopening?
294,It's in such bad faith.
295,Maybe due to better overall health?
296,Way less obesity and diabetes out there and general diets are better.
297,They also walk a fuckton even in the countryside.
298,If everyone had the same risk tolerance as me there would be no restrictions.
299,So yes and no.

314,I’ve never doubted that we would have a quick vaccine.

346,Having a mental illness is still an illness and anxiety can trigger a host of physical problems.
347,I believe they are not including the disruption time or the delay between shots in the estimate.
348,So most likely we are looking late June for everyone to have the chance to be fully vaccinated.
349,But the original July estimate did not include them either so this is still a two month improvement.
350,"&gt; Lots of talk about plateau regarding numbers

There is no plateau."
351,&gt;those numbers are showing growth.

360,"Oh, and we have a child at home!"
361,"So while I'm the statistically most vulnerable in the house, I gotta bunker down a bit longer."
362,Can't wait for June.
363,&gt; ..and you compared COVID to drunk driving.
364,"I compared death levels, not the wearing of masks."
365,You compared the wearing of masks.
366,We know masks for COVID saves more right now than preventing drunk driving.
367,"We don't know that for the flu, and in fact all those studies you see about how masks don't work are always dealing with the flu."
368,There is a reason why masks were not seen as important because studies on the flu and masks have not shown as big of a decrease in spread.
369,We have seen that with COVID.
370,So I am comparing a known (deaths prevented) while you are not.
371,Although I would love to see studies do in depth dives of how much widespread mask wearing would help during flu season.
372,&gt; Why does it need to save a certain number of lives before you support a mask mandate?
373,Why are yours different?
374,I am fully willing to admit there is a cost aspect of enforcing the rules vs. life benefit.
375,I know the benefit of wearing a mask right now for COVID is really high and well above something like drunk driving.
376,I don't believe masks for the flu are near that level.
377,Yet if I am wrong perhaps we should look into it.
378,We sure as shit should promote the wearing of masks if you are sick.
379,It is common many other places.
380,We also need rules to promote staying home from work and school during flu season.
381,"I know you badly want to make me seem like a hypocrite, but I am not."
382,I am not advocating preventing all death.
383,It is impossible and becomes cost prohibitive.
384,Yet you are the one cool with telling people they can't drink and drive which causes way fewer deaths than would prevented by COVID mask mandates.
385,"Sorry, but you are the hypocrite here."
386,You also have a level of deaths but for you it is not consistent.
387,"Oh, and the CDC is also on my side for both COVID and the flu."
388,I am willing to debate those things but at the end of the day we have experts for a reason who should be listened to and followed.
389,It may not be perfect but following them will be way better than random politicians who are willing to ignore science so they don't lose the redneck vote.
390,Cheers hope things are looking up for you!
391,I think we may be seeing the light at the end of the tunnel
392,At least I don’t live in the state directly in between...oh god damnit.
393,"“Hi, we have a customer trespassing in our store."
394,Can you send an officer to remove and charge him?”
395,I'm more curious if the vaccine supply will be able to keep up with vaccination capacity.
396,If mask mandates and lockdowns made that big of a difference we wouldn’t even be having this discussion the places who lifted restrictions earlier would have significantly more deaths not numbers that are comparable to places that kept them
397,There are two competing factors here.
398,"On the one hand, not every adult in the US \*wants\* a COVID vaccine."
399,The fraction who really want it is somewhere in the 55-80% range.
400,So we could get to the point where almost every adult who wants to be vaccinated has gotten their first dose well before there is enough supply for every adult.
401,"On the other hand, it takes a little while to go from ""doses shipped"" to ""doses in arm,"" so even if the supply is there, it could take a few weeks to see injection numbers catch up."
402,Longest undefended border in the world.

416,And included in Abbott's order is the stipulation that local jurisdictions institute masks and such based on specific hospital percentages.
417,There are contingencies in the order that I think can help them glide through this OK.
418,"So, to sum up their logic: don't use the vaccines that murdered babies during production, use the ones that murdered babies during research."
419,That kind of logic should fit right in with people who continue to worship rapists and pedophiles while proclaiming the rest of the world immoral.

477,"Rädler joined the library of the Amsterdam International Bureau of Fiscal Documentation (IBFD), one of the most comprehensive collections of tax literature in the world."
478,"There he measured how many of the total of 2,000 meters of shelf space are accounted for by books and magazines that deal with German tax law."
479,"The result: only about 200 meters, i.e."
480,ten percent.
481,An evaluation of the electronic inventory showed a share of almost 15 percent.
482,"&gt;  
&gt;Another comparison shows a similar result: According to a study by the World Bank and the consulting firm PwC, which compared the scope of corporate tax laws in different countries, the provisions and paragraphs in Germany fit 1700 pages - the United States, on the other hand, needs 5100 pages, Japan even 7200."

500,Biden will channel Bill Pullman in an epic speech
501,Why are you dodging my question though?
502,Is it because you don't want to admit that you wouldn't be willing to wear a mask during flu season even if saves lives.
503,I think that is the reason.
504,"I agree with you by the way, I'd rather sacrifice lives than to have to deal with annual mask mandates."
505,"Vaccine availability started december 14 and between then and now US vaccination rates are at 8%, and that's with very high utilization rates because we're still working through people who really, really want one."
506,"You could currently give every available vaccine out in seconds, with people like me who would fly or drive across the country to get one."
507,"Herd immunity will require, at the most ridiculously optimistic estimate, 60% or more of the population."
508,"So you're assuming we're going to be dosing people basically 10x faster than we are now, starting basically tomorrow."
509,That's ridiculous.
510,"It's not intended to be misleading, it's putting their death rate in perspective."
511,It's bad compared to almost all other countries in the world.
512,Comparing to other states is just trying to equivocate it with states that have done worse.
513,"And once again, Florida still has a lot of restrictions, just not statewide mandates."
514,Just because a hospital is doing it doesn't mean it has to be at the hospital.
515,Our hospitals do local flu vaccine clinics in huge parking lots and easily process more than 6k a day for pretty lengthy periods of times and have done it for years.
516,I mean my local Alberston's processed 500 shots before lunch with two pharmacists doing jabs.

540,How many miles to the hospital.
541,And also realize there aren't really set costs.
542,Let's say they had to do a CT scan.
543,"That could be $300 to $5,000."
544,Usually the higher end though.
545,There are also a lot of hidden fees as well.
546,"Plus there are different rates depending on what your insurance provider is, assuming you have any at all."
547,Due to the scale of payments insurance companies have they generally have better negotiated rates than individuals.
548,"Everything they do that could be billed will be recorded, and sometimes mistakes for extra items may skip through as well."
549,There is a variable amount but the answer is a lot.

556,&gt;**All Dutch people who want a corona vaccine can already receive at least their first shot at the beginning of July.

&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;Of the currently available vaccines (Moderna, AstraZeneca and Pfizer/BioNTech), two shots are needed."
559,"Of the vaccine of pharmaceutical company Janssen, which is expected to be approved by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) next week, we need only one shot."
560,"&gt;  
&gt;The government had previously reckoned that it would take until at least the beginning of autumn before everyone who wanted to would be at least partially vaccinated."
561,"However, based on recent experiences with the injection and delivery of the various vaccines, De Jonge is now more optimistic."
562,"&gt;  
&gt;The government is considering that about 85 percent of the 14 million adult Dutch people will be vaccinated."
563,Two-thirds of these could be fully vaccinated by the beginning of July; the rest would have had one shot.
564,"According to the minister, we will have administered 18 million shots."

576,Why do you need a study when you can test it at home.
577,Put the mask over your eyes and stare at a light in your house.

610,Man I sure hope so.
611,I'm beyond ready to be done with this pandemic.
612,I keep checking to see when I can get the vaccine but so far it's not yet available for my age group.
613,That’s precisely the issue.
614,It’s in the bottom half of states.
615,Your comparison of Florida to Mexico is designed to be misleading of Florida’s performance relative to other US states.
616,You should add in your comment that 35 other US states also have a death rate per capita worse than Mexico (including most of the states that are on strict lockdowns).
617,And I’m usually an optimist.
618,Or an optimistic realist.
619,"Sure, though that can be solved by your kids wearing masks going forward."
620,Nothing says you can’t wear a mask
621,I live in Texas.
622,"Thing is, so many people have already been going around maskless or not wearing them correctly."
623,"I think some people who don't live here just think it's going to be some sudden mad rush of people, but it's basically been business as usual here for months now."
624,"This won't change a whole lot, like you said."
625,"If anything, I think maybe people in other states will start protesting restrictions again trying to get their restrictions lifted."
626,Dude same:( I moved to Maine in May to live on a schooner but we never would’ve left the dock so I’m back in Michigan.
627,I got a taste of traveling in my early 20s and I just want to try it again without external complications.
628,You guys aren't fine even now.
629,"Incidence rate is still too high, positive test percentage too high."
630,"Sure, maybe your hospitals won't overflow as I can't fathom Abbott being as incompetent as not putting the breaks on when he realises the mistake he's made."
631,Incidence rate seems to be already rebounding quite quickly in the past 10 days so it's possible the UK variant is just reaching critical mass.
632,This would absolutely screw you guys at a ridiculously bad level.
633,Just look at what happened in the UK when Boris lifted the lockdown in early December.
634,Their incidence rate quadrupled in a month and it still was only about the same as Texas has currently.
635,I hope that you are right.
636,It would otherwise be such a waste as the US is getting so many doses of vaccinations and would only have to wait maybe a month or so to avoid such risks.
637,Incidence rates would be at a much more manageable level and at least you should be able to avoid the vast majority of deaths.
638,August for me.
639,This take a lot of pressure off.
640,I'd settle for old-fashioned human intelligence.

642,"I know people who are also concerned, in the absence of transmission data, that if they say met me at a bar and we were both vaccinated but I was carrying Covid and gave it to them, they would then give it to their kids."
643,"I think the science will wind up on the side of making this degree of caution unnecessary, so here's hoping!"
644,We should see the answer to that pretty soon.
645,With states like Arkansas loosening up public restrictions (higher restaurant capacities) and today Texas completely removed the Mask mandate (a State where only 11% are currently vaccinated).
646,"If those decisions cause a spike in cases, we’ll known pretty quickly if its a bad decision."
647,May 8th for us too!
648,We couldn't take the pressure so we're still doing a micro but still would be amazing to have everyone vaccinated.

678,Learn from us and tell my children i love them
679,"At this point, it's pretty much a CYA thing that's causing things to still be canceled."
680,NOBODY wants the bad press of their events being labeled a super spreader event
681,"I mean it makes sense, if I was in a city and had to ride the subway I'd probably try to find an m95."
682,But you gotta understand there are some rural as fuck places out there.
683,We had a county in my state that is still sitting at 3 total cases.
684,TOTAL!!!
685,You gotta understand that when something doesn't really effect them they don't really care.
686,"Sure one person could waltz in there and light up the whole town, but its not exactly metro station or an international hub."
687,People need to be able to make risk assessments on their own based on various scenarios.
688,Obviously a diabetic with cancer up there should still be super careful because of their risk group
689,"For sure but I can still see masks being ""required"" (but not really enforced well), especially in a place like CA."
690,&gt; Just wait until there is a solid population vaccinated (like 60%+ or whatever the math says will cause R to drop below 1).
691,But why would that stop the possibility of variants?
692,The two we are most worried about originated in SA and the UK.
693,The US having 60% vaccinated isn't going to all of a sudden stop the transmission for the rest of the world.
694,So fucking close to the endgame boys
695,LMFAOOLMFAOOLMFAOOLMFAOO
696,We should feel lucky that he didn't ban face mask in Texas
697,Also means that more people die and an increased chance of vaccine escape.
698,I really hope we get clear messaging and data on this over the summer so that people will let their kids go to school in the fall!
699,You just need people to get them.
700,"There’s a huge cross overlap of the people that will not get vaccinated, with same people who continue to gather, and refuse to wear masks."
701,(In the USA.)
702,But there isn't any uncertainty.
703,Astrazeneca is actually more effective with older people according to separate data from both England and Scotland than Pfizer!
704,Funny you say that because Extra History in their 1917 Flu series speculated one of the many reasons we don't teach the 1917 flu very often is because of people's unwillingness to discuss or talk about it with others.

712,"And they're adding to the long term costs of their public healthcare costs, including and especially the costs of those who went to ER with chronic conditions they otherwise wouldn't have had, and for many who got sick or died 10 years earlier than they would have otherwise."

788,"that said, for anyone concerned, any aborted fetuses used were aborted over a generation ago and have been frozen/cloned since then so it's not like they are freshly ""killing"" babies to get each vaccine (so don't believe the facebook posts that say otherwise)"
789,It's perfectly understandable if people want to workout at a gym.
790,But people acting like having gyms closed means they cannot get proper exercise is inherently false.
791,On top of that gyms are inefficient.
792,The only way gyms make a profit is by overselling their membership well beyond the capacity of the gym and then hoping that a large segment of that group never uses the gym.
793,Plus commuting to a gym is a friction point for many.
794,So actually gyms get to accomplish their goal when people decide not to go.

802,It depends on the place.
803,Supermarket checkout counters are subjected to so many microbes.
804,Raw meat is packaged in a way that often there are small leakages.
805,Cleaning those surfaces removes salmonella and other microbes.
806,"In places with higher foot traffic, you are going to encounter people who don’t wash their hands after using the restroom."
807,"At home or in office settings, frequent cleaning is less important"
808,"Basically I work in a building with maybe 20 people max, and it's a pretty large building so we're all spread out."
809,"I'm usually in the lab with one guy in his 70s, but we both wear masks all the time and stay as far away from each other as we can."
810,"People that can work from home usually opt to, especially on the sales side."
811,"As for what I do, the manufacturing team gives me something they built and I print out a test plan to make sure it's functioning properly."

814,"Nothing I do requires a security clearance, but I couldn't tell you what anything does because I genuinely don't know."

819,I’m sure the leaders preaching about it will take it in secret though
820,"We've been through a year of meaninglessness, lonely stress."
821,Everyone's mental health is bad right now and articles suggesting there's no light in the future and trying to extinguish all hope are going to make that worse.
822,There's no need to be insensitive.
823,That still doesnt change the fact that 2 people with one dose provides better protection overall than 1 person with 2 doses and another person with none.
824,We should be doing what the UK is doing and spreading out the second dose so we can get more people with some form of protection quicker.
825,We were.
826,My local hospital more than tripled capacity just for COVID cases and still had more patients than beds (they kept the extras in the ER waiting for admitted people to die or be discharged).
827,My city council's meeting room was converted to an ICU right as the state BANNED online conferences for local governments.
828,This meant they had to find a new place to meet to discuss city business.
829,"Bonus points: even though the population within city limits is much greater than the surrounding area, over half of those admitted to the hospital came from rural areas without mask mandates."

834,They’re both administered the same route into the muscle.
835,"And normally peak flu-shot season you do about 30ish a day, whereas some stores are doing more covid shots per day than that."
836,"Around December the amount of people getting flu shots starts to Peter off giving us a break, but due to timing it’s like cranking that engine back up again."

https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/press-briefings/2021/02/22/press-briefing-by-white-house-covid-19-response-team-and-public-health-officials-6/

&gt;So there are things, even if you’re vaccinated, that you’re not going to be able to do in society: for example, indoor dining, theaters, places where people congregate."
876,That’s because of the safety of society.
877,"You, yourself, what you can do when you are together with another person, we are looking at that, and we’re going to try and find out very quickly what recommendations could be made about what people can do."
878,"&gt;One of the things that’s universal here that we know: that at this point in time, it is unclear whether when you get vaccinated and you might be protected from clinical disease, which is the primary endpoint of the vaccine studies, that you could conceivably be infected, have virus in your nasopharynx, and at that same time have no symptoms, which is the reason why we recommend and say you still need to wear a mask."
879,"Because if you do have virus in your nasopharynx, even though we hope that when the data comes in, it’s going to show that the virus level is quite low and you’re not transmitting it, we don’t know that now."
880,"And for that reason, we want to make sure that people continue to wear masks despite the fact that they’re vaccinated."
881,It is against the rules to post misinformation and will lead to removal and some cases even a ban.
882,"There is no evidence from any research that the second dose does anything at all,  and a booster shot should be most effective around the 6 month point when antibody variation is at its highest."
883,The real reason (and not a bad one) for not changing is that our biggest problem in vaccination is going to be anti-vaxxers.
884,Oh for god's sakes!
885,This is getting ridiculous.
886,There have been a lot of unfounded claims about the dangers of variants for the sake of sensationalism and clicks.
887,"The variants are a bit more contagious, therefore less deadly since that's how viruses survive."
888,"But all this nonsense about it dodging vaccines, or undoing all our progress needs to stop."
889,In every country these people are going out of their way to make sure no one can see light at the end of the tunnel.
890,"Once the vaccine has been given to those at risk and is available to all who want it, there is no need for any more of this."
891,Nah it's dick heads of various ages.
892,"It makes sense to me too, but the red tape has everyone’s hands tied."
893,J&amp;J just got approval for the one shot so hopefully this will be a moot discussion by the end of the week.
894,I just hope people don’t turn it down because they want the Pfizer or Moderna instead.

968,50% are for taking the precautions necessary to stop the spread.
969,"50% do not see the need for precautions because the precautions worked, and they believe the precautions were an overreaction because they personally didn't experience people being sick, because the *precautions actually worked*"
970,It's not really an exception so much as what the catholic churches policy has been for some time.
971,Certain vaccines use components grown in fetal cell lines from a handful of fetuses aborted decades ago.
972,"The catholic church generally falls under the philosophy: if given a choice, pick a vaccine that does not use these cell lines but without a choice, protecting disease and the death and suffering it causes should be a priority."
973,The OP here seems to be referring to a paper published by the archdioceses of New Orleans.
974,"The vatican released a statement in December essentially summarizing their previous stance on vaccines, which might be what you are remembering: [https://apnews.com/article/europe-coronavirus-pandemic-vatican-city-pope-francis-476fedf6a30e32c4c3d294027dd3c606](https://apnews.com/article/europe-coronavirus-pandemic-vatican-city-pope-francis-476fedf6a30e32c4c3d294027dd3c606)"

998,I had the exact same thing happen.
999,Got banned for 12 for jokingly congratulating somebody for being eligible for the 5G fish people vaccine.
1000,&gt; I don't think anyone was ever expecting otherwise.
1001,"If you guys get done in May though, maybe you can help your neighbours?"
1002,I think May is the start of when *enough* vaccine doses become available for the general population in the US -- not when the US will be near the end of vaccinating everyone who wants to be vaccinated.
1003,That's not what the person above is saying...When you have higher self esteem you are more likely to make choices that lead to better health outcomes.
1004,Depression does not lead to healthy choices.
1005,Shaming the person for their weight instead of encouraging that they are in control and can do it for their health and not appearances is a worse approach.
1006,There is a lot of research done with people in poverty or low income neighborhoods not having access to supermarkets with produce and healthy foods.
1007,It's short-sighted to put this all on the individual like people have said.
1008,It's a multitude of factors.
1009,Health is holistic.
1010,That’s you though.
1011,There are also families who are following the science and going forward with it.
1012,There are pregnant women who have decided to get vaccinated.
1013,Covid could just be left alone like chicken pox.
1014,Vaccinated or not kids will spread it to each other and recover quickly.
1015,Even your 18 month old is not 100% safe even if you are vaccinated.
1016,You can still spread it.
1017,The goal is not to end up hospitalized or dying.
1018,Same here.
1019,"I've been so frustrated with it, that i don't wear the mask anymore, when leaving my complex."
1020,"Of nobody is within 3 feet of me, i refuse to wear it"
1021,There is almost no risk to you personally.
1022,The only risk is if you live with someone who is elderly or have a comorbidity.
1023,"Even then, those people should be vaccinated very soon."
1024,I can't help but feel so skeptical...but also so freaking relieved...like...I have been hardcore about social distancing and proper mask wearing and I've probably only left my house a handful of times.
1025,I can't wait to hang out with friends....go into a restaurant to sit down and eat (I just realized I haven't even done that since last February!!!
1026,)...go shopping without being nervous for the people who are starting shit up front because they don't want to wear a mask.
1027,Take my kids to a movie... Travel to see my family again...go to the fucking LIBRARY (all the libraries nearby have either been closed completely or you have to call to make an appointment just to go in and browse).

1057,"Scaling up the CDC's estimate from January, we'd be in the 30-35% range."
1058,It's also extremely unlikely that an additional 100 million people (over 3 million per day) will get their FIRST shot by end of March as we also give people second shots.
1059,We're not giving 5 million shots per day.

1064,And Vietnam also had a searing impact on the US.
1065,But much less global impact.
1066,I would say without a doubt the dissolution of the Soviet Union and the freeing of their satellites was probably the most important.
1067,I think would agree Indian independence probably more than COVID Sgt.
1068,Pepper?
1069,Hmmm.
1070,That’s a good observation.
1071,I would say yes in the long run no in the short run.
1072,But we also have Tiananmen Square and the rise of China far more important.
1073,COVID is in our psyche.
1074,It will there for a few years.
1075,And there is no question it’s impacted the lives and deaths of millions of people.
1076,But keep in mind we still have the moron half of the US that doesn’t even believe it exists.
1077,So their lives haven’t changed much.
1078,And I’m sure other countries probably have an equivalent herd of morons.
1079,But It will fade very quickly with our current attention span.

1214,Pause for a second a think about my statement.
1215,You are actively sowing discord and questioning science.
1216,"Science, mind you, that has been tested a billion times by people who are far smarter than me, far smarter than you."
1217,May I try an analogy?
1218,Your car has a flat tire.
1219,"You walk into a mechanic shop with your car and say ""Hey I could really use some help."""
1220,"The mechanic walks over and says ""well, we can fix this if we pull this big nail out of the tire and patch it""

You say: ""listen here you stupid mechanic..."
1221,"I subscribe to cylindrical earth theory and I understand that the shape of my wheel has nothing to do with this nail, for you see the shape of the wheel is a torus and not a circle, therefore this nail is not impeding it's ability to hold air pressure."
1222,"Kindly stop lying to me and stop making me question my entire reality about this so-called nail stuck in my tire, that's not the reason my tire is flat."
1223,"I'm leaving this liberal establishment filled with facists and going elsewhere."""
1224,"Shut the fuck up on the internet, go get a hobby, stop sowing distrust in science."
1225,"Doctors and scientists who have spent their entire life ... learning about what every scientist before them has ever discovered and learned, and then applying that information to improve humanity..

and some shit stain idiot on the internet like you shows up and undoes all of it just because you suddenly have the capability of making facebook posts."
1226,"Here's another analogy:

A man once began work on a beautiful sculpture."
1227,The year was 200CE.
1228,He had such grand plans for this sculpture that it ballooned beyond the scope of his entire life.
1229,"He worked on it until his death, but he wrote down what he wanted to do."
1230,His sons and daughters took up the chisels and continued his work where he left off.
1231,"The sculpture became more complex and more beautiful, more perfect."
1232,"Alas, the work was too much for multiple generations of people."
1233,"The man's family and the man's society continued to work on this for years, hundreds of years, and to this day in 2021, we still have an entire sect of people trying to achieve the perfect sculpture with their chisels and tools."
1234,"It's so intricate and complex it's something that you or I cannot even comprehend, but this sect of people have been improving on their tools, their notes, and their methods for hundreds of years, thousands of years."
1235,Will it be complete this year?
1236,"Probably not, for the work can be improved yet still."
1237,"In this analogy, the sculpture is our understanding of medicine."
1238,We have been improving our tools for as long as written history has existed.
1239,"You showing up right now and tossing a wet blanket on all of science is like walking up to this grandiose sculpture that's been worked on for hundreds of thousands of hours, and saying ""this is really dumb and you should do it a different way, it's not going to work."""
1240,Who the fuck are you to make that claim?
1241,Do you have some kind of science and knowledge that trumps all scientific advancements in all of humanity?
1242,"If you do, we should see it!!"
1243,"Please share your sage knowledge with us, oh bestowed one."
1244,Then most countries' are awful.
1245,Including Canada's.
1246,"Yeah, that’s why I typed it."
1247,I find it very frustrating when people trivialise the suffering lockdown has put so many through.
1248,It's not just missing concerts.
1249,"It's the destruction of many local businesses, many job losses, severe toll on mental health leading to suicides, kids having missed up to a year of their education, so much more."
1250,"What I was saying is that while we can use the covid stats to make our decisions, it's not something where we wait for the virus to say A-OK, lockdowns do end when we choose to end them."
1251,"We can make sacrafices to protect our fellow humans, yes."
1252,"But as we have learned, its only a small group (proportionately) who are in danger."
1253,"The CDC death rates by age:

0-19: 0.003%

20-49: 0.02%

50-69: 0.5%

70+: 6.4%

(From September 2020, I can't remember the updated stats off the top of my head but look at scenario 5: best estimate for IFR in [this link](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/hcp/planning-scenarios.html#table-1))

These make it clear that you are not in danger unless elderly or have multiple pre existing health conditions."
1254,So it's a little ridiculous to say to the majority of people to follow restrictions if the want to stay alive.
1255,"We're all doing this for the at risk people, but there comes a point when the cost of these sacrafices far outweigh the benefits and people are not being unreasonable when frustrated in hearing others say 'oh variants, you still have to follow restrictions through summer'."
1256,It's gone far beyond being just inconvenient now.
1257,"Pay attention to local restrictions, but people have been traveling domestically this whole time with few issues."
1258,"When I traveled in June 2020, the hardest thing was dining."
1259,"The state I visited had just started re-opening the week before I went, so restaurants were hit and miss around indoor dining or even being open at all when I was visiting."
1260,"Otherwise, I had no issues with that trip."
1261,"Every hotel I stayed at in 2020 felt safe, and flying was fine to me (outside of feeling really worn down wearing a mask as long I had to one travel day)."
1262,It really comes down to your own risk analysis and comfort levels at this point.

1264,"I think my favorite trope in this argument is when people point out South Korea, claiming that not every country with a strong response had to be an island."
1265,"After all, we all know South Korea isn't as island, and that it has a strong trade, tourism, and travel industry with its only bordering nation... *North Korea."
1266,*
1267,True but sometimes it’s not an option.
1268,Once they stop make it geopolitical and accept Chinese and Russian vaccines.
1269,A vaccine is a vaccine damnit.
1270,From what I understand it's just because it was tested that way and the FDA is authorizing on test data only.

1298,AZ is very safe.
1299,"There have been multiple trials to gauge it's safety, and also like 20% of British people have been jabbed with it so we would know by now if it was likely to cause anything truly horrible."
1300,"I've heard some rumors that AZ on average has worse side effects than Pfizer, but personally I got my first dose of Pfizer and felt like shit for two days so I'm not sure how much I buy into that, I suspect they are all similar on side effects."
1301,"Studies show the full two dose AZ vaccine is very effective at preventing symptomatic COVID, and almost completely protective against hospitalization and death, so it's a great vaccine."
1302,"The full two dose Pfizer and Moderna vaccines are *even more* protective than AZ against symptomatic COVID and also probably provide better protection than AZ against the South Africa variant (I'm guessing AZ will produce a booster to target the SA variant), so I guess if there is a choice of getting either and all other things are equal might as well get Pfizer or Moderna, but if I were unvaccinated and had a choice of getting AZ now or having to wait a couple months for a different vaccine to become available, I would get AZ without hesitation."

Saying children under 20, or even 16 aren't dying from covid is false, because children have died."
1413,Saying children are unaffected is also false.
1414,"Children have been getting MIS-C, which the CDC states they are still learning about and have no idea why some kids get it and don't."
1415,"While most children will hopefully recover, some will die (even without the MIS-C), and we don't even know full long-term effects for children except some may need long term coronary care."
1416,&gt;It’s like ppl are outright ignore data and science to push unsubstantiated fear mongering.
1417,Blanket statements that children are unaffected and won't die is like some people just outright ignore data and science to sound informed but really just ignore data points that don't fit their beliefs.
1418,"My example of lung damage was just that, an example."
1419,Much like covid in adults we don't know true long-term effects as we're not exactly long term in the timeline.
1420,So if i understand what your asking is about right now?
1421,We do know there can be long term issues for children.

1424,Yes.
1425,It blows my mind how Canada doesn't have domestic production.

1439,"Ask britain, UAE, and Israel."
1440,"""Vaccinated people can spread it too."""
1441,I think this was an initial concern.
1442,But the evidence seems to be leading that the vaccine in most cases does stop the spread of the virus.
1443,We'll know for sure in the coming months.
1444,"And yes, you are probably correct that covid will always be with us."
1445,But isn't science amazing!
1446,In a year or two the flu shot will likely contain booster covid shots to address variants.
1447,"Florida really was the ""emperor has no clothes"" moment for me as it relates to the effectiveness of lockdowns."
1448,When Florida kept tracking with the rest of the US consistently on per capita cases and deaths over the winter I slowly started to realize that restrictions don't do nearly as much as we think they do.
1449,Florida today is clearly better off than it would have been under a more strict system.

1461,Facts will decide.
1462,"You know, objective truths."
1463,"Most vaccines require two doses: true

It is still possible to transmit the virus even if you get the vaccine: true

COVID can still kill or cause significant side-effects to young people: true, but they are at a lower risk

COVID is a hoax: false

Wearing a mask does not slow transmission: false

It's impossible to contract the virus outside: false, but it is true it's a significantly lower risk"
1464,"If it has not been already enacted for a year with 500,000 deaths I think it won’t."
1465,Probably not after a while.
1466,But for the first few weeks it’d be one hell of a spectacle.
1467,"i think most people have an acceptable level of risk - we've gone our entire lives being potentially exposed to diseases like the flu that can be transmitted via respiratory droplets, and can cause death amongst vulnerable populations."
1468,"im not saying covid is like the flu, just that i think most people will want to return to normal not when there is no risk of covid, but when we reach what they feel is an acceptable level of risk."
1469,"we dont shut things down or implement social distancing or masking orders every flu season, and there is still a risk of catching a potentially dangerous virus that spreads via respiratory droplets and can kill vulnerable populations."
1470,"during the winters of 2018 and 2019 you probably were not terrified of getting the flu or spreading it to your family, and probably were not wearing a mask or sanitizing packages, so once vaccines are more widely rolled out, a sizeable percentage of folks are vaccinated, and case numbers/deaths/hospitalizations fall to numbers comparable to or below the seasonal flu, why remain terrified?"
1471,there are many risks we take every day that can result in death.
1472,once we get more of a handle on this thing via vaccines i think many people will be willing to return to normal with a level of risk they are ok with and wont feel the need to wait until there is no risk of covid.
1473,I'm more worried what happens when/if the current vaccines do become noticeably ineffective.
1474,"Like do we learn our lesson and line up for the new and improved, or go back to 12-15 months of this hell again."
1475,&gt; Vaccines for COVID-19 will start out being used under an Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) by the FDA.
1476,An EUA makes the vaccine available for public health emergencies.
1477,**It means that the vaccine is available outside of a research study but is not yet approved**.
1478,This is the usual first step for a new vaccine.
1479,The vaccine can continue to be used as long as people benefit from it.

1482,"Even without COVID, I think people should still wear masks if they have a cough or something."
1483,"I lived in Japan for 4 years and at first I thought it was weird for people to wear masks, but now I think it's necessary to keep people healthy as much as possible."
1484,Headline is slightly misleading.
1485,It said it should be avoided *if* the option is available.
1486,"Given the current state of the supply, it means this statement is pretty much inapplicable."
1487,"If you're male, 20-23% body fat is considered borderline obese, so it probably would."
1488,"If you're female, the numbers for obesity are a bit different, so it's probably best to say that there isn't much data."
1489,"On a more general point:

Overweight people in these studies will nearly always be fat people rather than muscular ones."
1490,"Despite the fact that any discussion of obesity inevitably results in people saying ""what about the people who are heavy because they work out and have muscle?"
1491,""", the reality is that those people are a very tiny proportion of the population."
1492,"Statistically speaking, virtually everyone who's significantly overweight is just fat."
1493,"That seems super excessive, are you in a role that requires you to wear gloves or something?"
1494,"If not, you're way better off just washing your hands more frequently"
1495,&gt;Last we want is the virus to mutate even further and be completely vaccine evasive.

1512,"The 95 percent figure is for people over 50, in which cases have absolutely cratered to almost nonexistence."
1513,55.1 leaves a very large pool of people to get infected.

1520,That just means we open vaccines to everyone sooner.

1526,"Israel signed a special agreement with Pfizer, not only did they pay extra, they are also turning over all their health data."
1527,They can do this because they have only 9 million people and a very robust healthcare information system.

1532,"We don’t know why there was this initial surge in infection risk but it may be related to people being less cautious about maintaining protective behaviours as soon as they have the injection,” said Hunter."""""
1533,That’s good!
1534,"And, probably provides even more reassurance for you both!"
1535,The word 'wave' is so broad.
1536,"If we end up peaking at say 100-150k cases again, but then the hospitalizations/deaths stay decreasing due to vaccines, and then eventually the cases go down too due to the vaccine eligibility increasing to everyone 16+, does it honestly matter that much if there's another wave?"
1537,Some people on here keep painting this viewpoint as naive optimism but I have never denied that there is the potential of a wave in the spring.
1538,"There's no point in.bejng worried though if jt will likely not be catastrophic, and there are almost no expert voices suggesting a catastrophic wave in the US at least"
1539,So your view is history is basically how americans go to work.

1577,Just pointing out that the data that is available shows that Florida has been no different than most other states.
1578,"Because this sub is infested with people who think COVID is a hoax, or overblown, or not actually that bad, or literally only kills people who are over 80, or has literally no side effects whatsoever if it doesn't kill you."

1583,Florida is literally one of the worst states.
1584,"Add to that, the governor has been hiding the true number of deaths for months."
1585,A mask mandate requiring people to wear a mask when in public has causes NO irreversible pain.
1586,What a ridiculous statement.
1587,Do you really think wearing a mask causes irreversible pain?
1588,"&gt;Maybe if New York didn’t send sick people back to nursing homes 

No doubt."
1589,That we can agree on.
1590,Doesn't change the fact their hospitals were overrun though.
1591,"But that's even more reason to get vaccinated, because people are not wearing masks anymore and going out again and being reckless..."

1647,Right?
1648,&gt;Fauci floating indefinite masking and distancing into 2022 is fucking dumb.
1649,"Biden suggesting things might not be normal “until Christmas” is dumb too

But at the same time, people get pissy about “moving the goalposts” when anything takes longer than they expected."
1650,Some things genuinely aren’t going to be back to normal until 2022.
1651,And lying to people about it isn’t going to help anyone.
1652,All the major approved vaccines are effective against it.
1653,We good.
1654,I swear if TX breeds some stupid variant that prevents me from safely taking my post-vaccination trip to Vegas in the fall I'm going to move to Texas and run for office.

1670,"I hope we are/agree, but I think for some families, they won't go back to normal if their kids don't have vaccines."
1671,We’ve already seen some easing in Colorado in some of the gym capacity restrictions.
1672,I’ve expected through the spring and summer things will ease up even more.
1673,I figure to be wearing masks through at least the summer.
1674,"But that’s such an easy ask, I still don’t understand why anybody fights against that."
1675,"Once fully vaccinated by the end of the month, I’ll be wearing a disposable mask (as opposed to my current N95s), dining out again and going to movies."
1676,Yay!
1677,"Once it’s widely available, isn’t the risk on them at that point?"
1678,"Don’t get me wrong I don’t like it or needless death to put it mildly, but what’s the case for not going back to normal once everyone has had the opportunity to be vaccinated?"
1679,Or they could ... you know ... push their elected officials to follow science instead of stupidity.
1680,If we have another surge it's going to be thanks to fools like Abbott.
1681,Follow the science rather than appearances.
1682,This is literally how every virus &amp; vaccine works.
1683,OTHERWISE THE VACCINES WOULDNT BE AS EFFECTIVE.
1684,My bizarre theory is that there was a largely invisible wave in Asia before it hit the rest of the world.
1685,The mass Tokyo serology study showed 50% were immune in Tokyo by October.
1686,And this was with only 139 covid deaths in the city.
1687,The study continued and over three months 50% measurable antibodies disappeared but immunity remained.
1688,"This is all to say once we started doing serology testing April the invisible wave was gone but immunity remained, easing the epidemics and slowing the spread enough that lockdowns and NPIs really were effective in Asia."
1689,"For the rest of the world uninitiated, however..."
1690,There's already no statewide mandate for masks and things are already pretty open down here.
1691,Still it’s in the bottom half of deaths per capita and it also has an older population than nearly all the other states so it’s deaths per capita should skew higher and yet it doesn’t.
1692,LOVE TO SEE IT!!!
1693,Do you have a source?!
1694,I need to send to my friends who have been super depressed and doubting.
1695,No they haven't.
1696,Their reasoning is they have been shut down long enough and eventually enough people will be vaccinated.
1697,"Even if more people get sick and die than have been in recent weeks, which is a lot as it is."
1698,Do you honestly expect a Texas governor to understand science?

1701,"Right because the people go there for fun, catch the good virus and bring it home."
1702,"Yes, shame on Public Health UK's decision that has saved 1000's of lives."
1703,The dosing interval that was set in trials was scientific dictum and it should never have been questioned.
1704,How dare they use the collective scientific wisdom of the JVCI  to rescue their country during the thick of a pandemic.
1705,The FDA should be lauded for their inflexibility.
1706,"Masks mostly protect others, so I would avoid businesses when masks are not required."
1707,"I still go to retailers and other local businesses where masks are required, but if people are maskless I only shop online until I’m fully vaccinated."
1708,For real.
1709,One silver lining for me last year was that I didn't have to talk to anyone.
1710,"But for fuck's sake, I'm sick of these ads from banks or big corporations saying ""these unprecedented times"" or ""we're all in this together""."
1711,I think you are mistaking the stock market for the economy.
1712,The economy is suffering right now even though the stock market is doing well.
1713,"Unemployment is through the roof, the GDP has fallen, businesses are closing, etc."
1714,Do me anyone who supported these restrictions was much more selfish than anyone I know.
1715,Is it selfish for people with cancer to want preventative treatment?
1716,Or people with mental health issues to get actual help?
1717,How much irreversible pain do you think has been caused by these measures?
1718,Are those people supposed to accept that because of a disease with a less than 1% fatality rate?
1719,"Quarantine those at risk, not everyone else."
1720,"And people being stacked in hallways doesn’t change the fact that many covid hospitals specifically made to deal with that problem, went unused and were tore down a few months later."
1721,Maybe if New York didn’t send sick people back to nursing homes and everyone in Italy didn’t live with their grandparents they would’ve done better.
1722,"Can you please resubmit this with just the actual title: Pfizer doubles the number of deliveries to the Netherlands: half a million doses per week

Happy to approve then."
1723,Please lmk when you repost.
1724,Bless you for being rational and responsible.
1725,"Yeah I agree, I think this is more directed to the idiots who run in highly transited areas without face masks."
1726,The sad part is that they don’t
1727,"Underpromise, overperform."
1728,"A nice change from a series of lies, excuses, and shrugs."
1729,"Absolutely, can't show weakness against those librul scientists"
1730,The people you are referring to have been finding ways to do that for the past year.
1731,This really won't suddenly change the behavior of most people.
1732,Deaths and hospitalizations will continue to decline.
1733,!RemindMe 1 month.
1734,💋👅
1735,No side effects other than a sore shoulder muscle.
1736,We already have mass 24 hour vaccination sites.
1737,My wife's grandma got her vaccine in CitiField at 3 am.
1738,"Anyway, with a few weeks preparation and unlimited doses of vaccines available, we could scale to many times the number what we're doing now."
1739,I think in practice we are unlikely to see much more than 5M in any one day because we're going to be capped by vaccine production lower than that until the crunch subsides.
1740,"Okay, I get it's better to be safe than sorry."
1741,"But in this situation, the more time we spend doing more than necessary to protect ourselves the worse the negative consequences of that get for everyone."
1742,So we can't be too cautious because there are other things at stake.
1743,But with the way we're acting with regards to covid you'd think the death rate was 10%.
1744,We need to act on evidence like this.
1745,"While we shouldn't ignore evidence of the bad things about covid, we can't ignore evidence that puts our fear into perspective either."
1746,"We have to balance doing too little with doing too much, because our precautions are damaging."
1747,"Yeah too many selfish assholes went out there and did things like work at grocery delivery services, amazon warehouses and restaurant kitchens for us to really quash this thing."
1748,I wish more people realized this.
1749,"If we just took this shit seriously from the start, we would be in such a better place."
1750,We are almost there now despite all that and we are still trying to fuck it up.
1751,"It’s bizarre, and I would not have believed it if this were in a movie 5 years ago."
1752,Yeah.
1753,"If I can’t keep 6 ft away from others, I’ll put it on as a courtesy."
1754,"If I’m not in close physical proximity to others, nope."
1755,Is the pandemic over?
1756,Can't fix stupid.
1757,"Well, except 27th isn't ""Bottom quartile"""
1758,Check early morning (before 7am) and you'll be able to find more availability.
1759,&gt;the remaining half will get them this month alone.
1760,I’m sure it will be a great comfort to the families of the people who die that at least they had a vaccine appointment scheduled for later in the month.
1761,!RemindMe 1 month
1762,Lol maybe if I’m running in Central Park.
1763,I cross the street if I see another soul.
1764,I am not running with a mask.

1766,"Florida is 27th, that's hardly bottom quartile."
1767,They are average.
1768,"And as mentioned above, while Florida doesn't have state wide mandates, cities and counties do."
1769,Lock downs and masking mandates are only as effective though as the population sticks to them.
1770,We've had mandates here in AZ for months but our state is full of anti masking morons who gather and spread.
1771,Now we're 6th in deaths per capita.
1772,"Archive link: https://archive.fo/LfNRz

This strikes me as overly cautious."
1773,"Outdoor transmission is almost 20x less and someone running past you will only be within six feet of you for a second or two at most - probably far less since as you jog, you're going to weave past people and try to give them a wide berth."
1774,So a couple of seconds of exposure with maximum ventilation and decent distancing.
1775,"If the virus really spread in that scenario, then the R value would be through the fucking roof."
1776,"A bunch of stuff you use in daily life are under their production, just in different brand name."
1777,"You are still alive, arent you?"
1778,They didn’t try because they want with the approach that would be the most likely to work and give them approval.
1779,But it’s very possible that we are giving people too high of a dose/the second dose of the vaccine is less important than we first thought.
1780,Congrats!

1819,My hospital bill for that?
1820,$120.
1821,Which was a combination of amenities charges (having a TV in the room) and some pharmacy costs when I was discharged.

1828,Plus the whole thing is outside.
1829,Says a person who's constantly covering up and downplaying the effects of Sweden's horribly bad Covid-strategy.
1830,It still matters _lot_.
1831,"If we have a situation of high transmission but low fatality (like, for example, a ton of super-spreader events from a small number of very sick people), we are setting ourselves up for the highest possible chance of vaccine-evading mutations by selectively breeding for it."
1832,"If we don't actually reduce the transmission rates drastically, we're in for a much, much worse time as near as I understand it."

1877,I was wondering the same thing.
1878,"I think it has to do with politicians liking the J&amp;J vaccine because although it’s not as effective, it’s “good enough” and because it’s only 1 dose it makes their job of distribution much much easier."
1879,The trials were not botched.
1880,The November data showed efficacy of 70% which is higher than what you get from a flu vaccine and way above the WHO threshold for what is deemed efficacious at 50% .
1881,"However, in the case of a smaller sample of patients: instead of giving two full doses they were accidentally just given half of a full dose for their first injection and they then recieved a full dose second."
1882,"Doing it this way,  they found this order gave efficacy of 92+% 

Naturally, they wanted to confirm this was statistically sound and they repeated the trials doing it this way on a much larger sample size."
1883,"In the meantime, the UK went ahead and approved the vaccine on the assurance that it would be at worst 70% effective, and at best 92%."
1884,"Critically, the trial did not have a sufficiently representative number of over 65s."
1885,This would later make the EU apprehensive.
1886,"Meanwhile, the EU wanted to demonstrate their independence from the UK and took far longer for approval to be granted."
1887,"Thus, AZ prioritised contracts with the UK over the EU."
1888,Then down the line a supply shortage occurred cos AZ were upgrading a factory in Belgian in order to fulfill more orders long term.
1889,So buy that time most of the orders had be taken and this left the EU out in the cold.
1890,There was likely a good bit of politics and Brexit related political grandstanding that complicated things.
1891,But at no point did AZ botch the trial or bend their results.
1892,"This vaccine came out of Oxford University, one of the best institutions in the world."
1893,Researchers and scientists were staking their academic integrity on the results.
1894,"And critically, the vaccine is being sold at cost , so there was nothing to gain by rushing or dodging the results."
1895,"As a Texan, let me assure you that the existing restrictions were already being basically ignored."
1896,So today’s news won’t exactly change that much.
1897,fried sweet potatoes are better than a lot of that ;)  Fry away!
1898,"refined processed wheat products all containing HFCS aren't going to provide a big rush of energy in the morning, just give something else a try and see what you think"
1899,Don’t make up more doom and gloom than is already out there.
1900,What’s the point?
1901,Especially something as obviously wrong as this.
1902,"If the current projections are correct we will be 100% reopened by late summer, so there will definitely be music festivals etc by that point"
1903,Omg this.
1904,"I had a massive postpartum hemorrhage in early 2019, and for months after, I had that telltale phantom pain of my internal bleeding."
1905,It was horrifying.
1906,"Rashes, apparently -

A recent study found that for 17% of COVID-19 patients with multiple symptoms, skin rashes were the first symptom to appear, while for 21% of patients rashes were their only symptom."
1907,Being able to identify the effects of COVID-19 on the skin may allow cases to be spotted earlier – or even picked up altogether in people who are otherwise asymptomatic.
1908,This could help limit transmission.
1909,"It's the 10th in Texas

  
Kill me"
1910,"But my friend lives in another country, so the date that matters for me in that regard is different, haha."
1911,"But still, yeah, I get that there’s a difference between available and administered and that availability was what was mentioned, I’m just saying that I don’t think it’s too far-fetched to think administered won’t be far behind."
1912,"If we have enough for ALL adults by the end of May, isn’t it likely that the people that really want one will probably be able to get it by then since there’s a portion of adults that are on the fence or might not want one?"
1913,see Israel data.
1914,Both infections and deaths havent moved that much
1915,/r/Coronavirus2
1916,"It seems like you're saying lockdowns are not a big factor, which is impossible to compare state to state given all the other unknowns."
1917,"&gt; That said, I'll be very happy when I never have to wear a mask to work again."
1918,"I know this is unpopular and sure to ruffle some feathers, but please, look at the side-effects of our coronavirus precautions, particularly on the incidents of flu worldwide."
1919,"I'm ready for lockdowns to be over and businesses to fully open but I, for one, plan on taking an important lesson from this ordeal -- my health and my neighbor's health are linked."
1920,"For the rest of my life, during flu season, I plan on wearing masks and practicing some _limited_ form of social distancing."
1921,"In the winter months, that might just take the form of choosing more often to get take-out rather than eating out or electing to host (and attend) fewer (and smaller) social gatherings."
1922,"It's not going to dominate my life, but I will take steps to limit my exposure to and transmission of respiratory viruses going forward."
1923,No I'm not.
1924,"He's the one with the ""controversial take"""
1925,I wear a mask all day at work.
1926,It's not even an issue.
1927,I want to continue with them!
1928,I haven't been sick in a year!!!!
1929,Wearing masks when you aren't feeling well should be the norm.
1930,Good day for people who love good news.
1931,"One thing I've noted a few times: just like there were (and are) people who thought we never should have shut down, there are going to be just as many saying we shouldn't open up."
1932,What actually has played/will play out in the US falls somewhere between these two extremes.
1933,This is a situation in which it pays to hold moderate beliefs; chances are higher you'll get the card you wanted.
1934,"And no, I'm not praising the middle of the *political* spectrum."
1935,I am only referring to perceived threat from covid here.
1936,I'd imagine the risk of mutations is greater in other countries where it will take much longer to vaccinate their population.
1937,Texas will reach herd immunity by June most likely.
1938,W.H.O.
1939,does this everywhere.
1940,"you're right, and the FDA approved the change."
1941,It can last up to something like 2 weeks in more normal freezer temperatures.
1942,A+ to Biden
1943,"Texas is about to end the mask mandate (and open 100%), but I'm still planning on wearing face masks for the foreseeable future, even after I get vaccinated."
1944,I think the more info that comes about how likely a vaccinated person is able to spread covid will change that opinion.
1945,It seems like early data shows the vaccine does help against spread is a good thing.
1946,[removed]
1947,Wait.
1948,We weren’t supposed to do that?
1949,😳
1950,"Texas, and other fully open states if there are any — are vaccines available to anyone who wants one, for example, if you’re a young person with underlying conditions, are you able to be vaccinated now?"
1951,"How are people feeling now that restrictions are going away, but the vaccine may not yet be available to you because you don’t yet qualify?"
1952,"I don’t live in Texas, but it is pretty apparent that there is not going to be a large difference in cases because no one followed the orders."
1953,I’m June 25th!
1954,It’s’s nice to see fellow couples keeping some cautious optimism!
1955,"🤞🏼

I had to unsubscribe from r/weddingplanning because it was stressing me out too much."
1956,He means they'll have the supply.
1957,"Administration of them all will probably still take until mid summer, but this is pretty big news, not just for US but for your neighbours who will be helped out greatly once you have enough supply for your entire population."
1958,"I can't see it being later than July or very early August until the vaccine campaign wraps up, but likely a near normal entire summer regardless."
1959,"(I think for most the western world, tbh)"
1960,Got my immune system for that buddy but thanks anyway
1961,Did you ever make it back to your desk?
1962,"You mean, [FOOF!!!!"

1970,You’re telling me!
1971,I live 20 minutes from Angel’s stadium and it’s a privilege to be able to see him play when ever I want (well pre pandemic of course)
1972,I have two small kids and got my first dose of Pfizer yesterday.
1973,The kids are going to be a weird issue for us in terms of our personal behavior — which is a separate issue from whether the rest of society should remain closed until every last child is vaccinated (i.e.
1974,that would be a ridiculous policy).
1975,"While we will be doing things with other fully vaccinated adults, and while obviously every business and activity should open up for adults assuming we crush case counts, other kids will always be a huge transmission risk until they’re vaccinated."
1976,"That means that even if my adult life goes back to normal in some respects, my kids are going to have to play outside and keep their distance with other kids, which means no sleepovers or indoor birthday parties."
1977,It’s going to be a problem to allow unvaccinated children to act as tiny reservoirs for the virus for another year or so.
1978,"They really should have planned to vaccinate kids last, but before the fall."
1979,Agree to disagree... at least for the US.
1980,Same.
1981,I really need to see a dentist but have been putting it off.

1983,"""But the biggest problem is as soon as the weather warms up people will not do ANYTHING anymore."""
1984,The summer is incredibly good for the virus though as people tend to socialize outdoors rather than indoors.
1985,Respiratory viruses don't often spread in the summer in the northern hemisphere.
1986,There is a reason why NYCs numbers continued to drop drastically in april-june even as more and more people returned back to the subways and socialized more.
1987,Fully vaccinated people are encouraged to meet in small groups in homes.
1988,"That means 28 days out from the second vaccine administration, iiuc."
1989,"Also, unless your local emergency orders have exceptions for vaccinated people (no exceptions to the ones in my area, for example), it may still be illegal for you to visit with another person, even if both of you are fully vaccinated."
1990,"I expect the emergency orders to change as more people are vaccinated, though."

2113,The numbers are very arbitrary and the metrics don’t necessarily matter much.

2117,"But yes, variants can change the equation (and we already have some around that could be a problem)."

2197,"Greg Abbott said Tuesday, making it the largest state to end an order intended to prevent the spread of the coronavirus that has killed more than 42,000 Texans."
2198,"&gt;The Republican governor has faced sharp criticism from his party over the mandate, which was imposed eight months ago, and other COVID-19 restrictions."
2199,"It was only ever lightly enforced, even during the worst outbreaks of the pandemic."
2200,"&gt;Texas will also do away with limits on the number of diners that businesses can serve indoors, said Abbott, who made the announcement at a restaurant in Lubbock."
2201,"&gt;“The fact that things are headed in the right direction doesn’t mean we have succeeded in eradicating the risk,” said Dr. Lauren Ancel Meyers, a professor of integrative biology and director of the University of Texas COVID-19 Modeling Consortium."
2202,"&gt;She said the recent deadly winter freeze in Texas that left millions of people without power — forcing families to shelter closely with others who still had heat — could amplify transmission of the virus in the weeks ahead, although it remains too early to tell."
2203,"Masks, she said, are one of the most effective strategies to curb the spread."
2204,I know at least 20-30 foreign students who spend a summer in the US for 3 months in 2019 to work and travel and so far they all milked 20k+ of unemployment money.
2205,Their system is a joke
2206,What an idiot

2211,*
2212,I doubt EWTN is on this bandwagon.
2213,"For ""traditional Catholic"" news outlets, on the other hand..."
2214,No.
2215,Hospitals aren’t designed for that sort of thing.
2216,I’m sure FEMA would be better at coordinating this than a hospital.
2217,Convention centers can safely hold a lot of people and have adequate storage.
2218,You can’t safely vaccinate thousands of people per day at a hospital.
2219,Waters not wet bruh
2220,"This is one of those ""accurate, but..."" situations."
2221,A lot of this is book-keeping issues.
2222,"For example if you pull your kid from a public school and enroll them in a legitimate home-schooling program offered in your state, sometimes that will be tracked correctly but other times there's a delay/problem resulting in students being ""missing"" until the end of the school year (and even then sometimes it requires manual record consolidation, because the homeschooling programs didn't include the state's unique identifier for the student)."
2223,"Aside from the data issues, which are very real, parents also common drop the ball in terms of paperwork (e.g."
2224,failure to notify the state that they're having their kid do an out-of-state home school program).
2225,"This typically resolves itself when the parent gets a nasty-gram letter from the state, but things are backed up due to the sheer numbers involved."
2226,I guess my point is: This is likely a *real* problem (i.e.
2227,"some kids aren't getting an education), but we have no idea how many/the scale, because even in more normal times keeping track of kids is a mess and tons of parents pulling kids out at the same time has amplified this problem."
2228,No.
2229,You wear as many masks and douse yourself in as much disinfectant as you like.
2230,But I thought it was up to the states about when they will release availability to other citizens?
2231,Only reason I ask is wouldn’t the supply and demand differ by state which would also cause the estimated time to vaccinate other groups to vary?
2232,Their moral code is contributing to a culture of divisiveness and shaming in our society that is pervasive and going to be here long after the pandemic.
2233,No one this year has been allowed to have a different set of values without being called “callous” or a “grandma killer” - no more.
2234,There is no virtue in empathy that results in normalizing abnormal and mentally ill behavior (like demanding masks at a beach).
2235,Deaths are not the only metric by which to evaluate decisions
2236,He did what every single conservative I know around me wanted.
2237,"To end this, and it's absurd."
2238,"He mentioned half of seniors have the vaccine, and somehow the remaining half will get them this month alone."
2239,"I check for my parents, but I can never see where they can get them."
2240,It's ridiculous.
2241,"Ending the mask mandate though, ugh."
2242,That should at least stay in effect.
2243,lmao.
2244,you seem pleasant.
2245,Bet i could outrace and out lift you.
2246,finger muscles don't count.

2256,"Ok, what is it with Republicans and this mindset that Covid is done and over with?"
2257,"Because that's far from the case, and this mindset is going to cause another wave because of it."
2258,What is considered overweight.
2259,Someone wearing an XL shirt (half of America)  or people who are 500lbs?

2266,"&gt;The coronavirus variant originally found in Manaus in Brazil and detected in six cases in the UK was able to infect 25% to 61% of the people in the Amazonian city who might have expected to be immune after a first bout of Covid, researchers say."
2267,"The extent to which P1 can evade the immune system, and potentially vaccines, emerged as the UK health secretary said the hunt for one person who tested positive for P1 – but did not leave contact details – had narrowed to 379 households in the south-east of England."
2268,"Dr Nuno Faria of the MRC Centre for Global Infectious Disease Analysis at Imperial College London, said it had concluded that the variant was causing people who had already suffered from Covid to get it again."

2271,He’s sending texas back to normal... as much as I’m all for risk assessment and getting to normal sooner than is widely accepted.
2272,It’s WAYY too soon
2273,"But also to say, that 1 in 20 has a vastly reduced chance at hospitalization and death."
2274,It relegates the virus to the common cold at worse.
2275,"Yea I mostly eat processed stuff for breakfast like bagels, pancakes,  and frozen eggo waffles and Jimmy Dean sausege biscuits."
2276,I am also not a fan of sweet potatoes unless it's in fry form but those ideas are not bad.
2277,Brazil is a big one but no country here is innocent.
2278,Even if the rate of increase is slowing down for example India and Canada the total active case counts are still going up.
2279,People forgot how to add apparently from one day to the next.
2280,Total case numbers are not being told as loudly as the daily new case count which is making people think the virus is going away.
2281,"We didn't require masks in supermarkets during past flu seasons so I don't see why we would require them for future flu seasons, considering that mask mandates are a temporary emergency measure to combat a pandemic that is much worse than the flu, not a permanent policy."
2282,We can't just constantly keep finding new aspects of everyday life to permanently TSA-ify every time there's a temporary crisis no matter how giddy some people are about it.
2283,Grew up in one.
2284,Public transportation is basically non-existent.
2285,But this comment chain has been about the existence of food deserts within cities and the health concerns that they pose to society.
2286,"From a public health standpoint, there are serious barriers that low income/marginalized groups face that negatively affect their well-being."
2287,Traveling a mile in a city can be a serious barrier for these groups.
2288,"Again, I'm not saying that cities have less transportation options, but marginalized groups do not have the luxury of using these options from multiple standpoints of cost, time investment, and infrastructure."
2289,This is not to say that rural communities don't have there own issues with availability and accessibility to healthy food.
2290,They very much so do.
2291,That is why there is a term (food desert) and research that goes into addressing the issue.
2292,"Food deserts are a complex issue, with each area having different challenges that they will experience."
2293,"If you are not informed about a problem, you can not create initiates and invest resources into fixing the said issue."
2294,I imagine a dude with a cowboy hat sitting on an old mine shaft and then hopping on his horse at the end.
2295,He’s definitely wearing a bandana as a mask too
2296,I’d love to see a source that says any of these strains are “vaccine resistant”
2297,"&gt; Otherwise, if you just ignore that because the risk might be higher, you end up being a panicked hypochondriac."
2298,Except I'm not saying either one of those things either.
2299,"I'm just saying ""Don't make assumptions."""
2300,(period.
2301,point blank.
2302,full stop.)
2303,Nothing more.
2304,"If you want to protect yourself against something... you have to do ""more than you think you should""."
2305,(that's the safer default strategy).
2306,"Doing ""less than you think you should"".. is not a smart strategy."
2307,"If you want to ensure something bad doesn't happen to you (especially when 1 of the possible outcomes is death)... you presumably want to do ""more than expected"" (but not to the hyperbolic degree of ""being a panicked hypochondriac"", which nobody here is advocating)."
2308,"Based on the way that things are going in the West, I think that the period from February to mid March will be looked back on as the ""Variants of Concern"" era, basically the last breath of the virus in North America and Europe before spring and vaccines put it away for good."
2309,Me and my fiancé both got our first shot and will get the second next week.
2310,We just signed up for a gym yesterday.
2311,"With the vaccine were more comfortable occasionally going to a local restaurant to directly support local business, but will remain 100% masked at every opportunity."
2312,The vaccine will allow most of us to slowly resume “normal” activity but that doesn’t mean we should go crazy just yet.
2313,The EU drug substance production will happen in the Netherlands at Janssen Vaccines.
2314,"There are contractors in Italy, Spain, South Africa, India and the United States for fill and finish."
2315,This will then be imported back into the EU (expect for Italy and Spain of course).
2316,Great!
2317,[deleted]
2318,But that’s bad enough for low info patients who get most of their views from EWTN.
2319,This was frustrating to watch.
2320,"My wife and I have isolated pretty well since we're both at risk, and my wife is worried about schools opening up 100%."
2321,Especially since nobody was enforcing the mask mandate.
2322,Most of this felt like a huge pat on the back for businesses and fewer regulations.
2323,It was pretty annoying to listen to.
2324,"Yeah, the wave numbering system is just confusing non-sense all manufacturing is 1b, but 1b is actually divided into priority groups."
2325,"So everyplace vaccinating 1b, but not all of 1b."
2326,It's like some participation trophy joke.
2327,"They should have had one group per wave and number them instead of this ""One, One and a half, One and three quarters"" juvenile bullshit."
2328,"I mean, is there even a Wave 2 or did they managed to get everyone into Wave 1?"
2329,"I'm french, and AFAIK, the issue the people here have with AZ vaccine has nothing to do with what Macron said (I had not heard about it, and I watch News channels, read the papers), and everything to do with it not being as effective as Pfizer or Moderna against the new variants that are currently spreading in France."
2330,"I got the AZ shot saturday, and feel lucky to have been offered it."
2331,Better to have than to hope.
2332,"(*Un ""tiens"" vaut mieux que deux ""tu l'auras"" !"
2333,"*)

Also I assume, that down the line I will be offered a booster or new type of vaccine against the new variants."
2334,Colorado.
2335,Sorry to hear that it’s in Nevada too lmao
2336,Thanks for the reply.
2337,I don't have a definite view on this but thought it was a really interesting question.
2338,"Geopolitically, I think either 9/11 or the fall of the USSR will be seen as most significant."
2339,Culturally (in the sort of 'artistic' sense of culture) ... well I put Sgt Pepper down as  a sort of symbol of social and cultural changes in the Sixties: there might well be better (Larkin may have preferred the Please Please Me album!).
2340,"But I do think (from an admittedly Western perspective) that this pandemic will,  along with 9/11, be the event where people will distinguish between 'before' and 'after'."
2341,"I know it's a commonplace to talk about the prospect of a 'new normal' but just moving to a working culture where working from home (for a large part, not all by any means) of the workforce is a standard pattern has colossal implications for society."
2342,I'm just picking out one thing there.
2343,International diplomacy based on vaccines may well be another.
2344,"So I do disagree with your view, I guess, but I don't know - this is just how I see things."
2345,Thanks for addressing the question!
2346,We bought our vaccines too.
2347,So how can they fill all the orders before they’ve made that amount.
2348,Well the issue is the difference between how the scientific community views a journal paper vs how the public views the news.
2349,The scientific community is aware that an accepted theory/paper/conclusion/ect.
2350,"Is by no means concrete, it’s the best available information at the time of its writing (that doesn’t mean it’s 100% true)."
2351,"The public view the news (or at least what ever flavor of news they consume) as fact because the news often takes that same jornal paper, study, what ever, and hammers the nuance and ambiguity out of it and write it down as an end all be all truth."
2352,"So when that journal paper becomes obsolete by a new study/finding, in the scientific community their response is “ahh new information lead to be more robust understanding” while the public thinks that someone along the way lied, either the new journal, the old journal, the journal publisher, the scientific community or the news."
2353,"When if fact there was never a lie, only a misrepresentation to the public of the validity and confidence of the original finding."
2354,"Tell you what, I’ll buy you a beer when the world unclenches its fist and we can disagree like gentlemen."
2355,Haha
2356,"If it makes you feel any better, every vaccine administered cuts down on transmission."
2357,So we all receive a net societal benefit no matter who gets it.
2358,In NJ the state health commissioner announced yesterday she is confident NJ will have enough doses to vaccinate every single adult fully by end of May.
2359,Obviously it will take some time past that to fully administer but given that only 60-80 percent want a vaccine that means likely it will open up to the general public sometime in April or early May I suspect.
2360,[deleted]
2361,"Any news outlet that puts words like ""may"" in their titles needs to hire better editors."
2362,"I ""may"" stumble upon $700 cash money when I walk outside... will I though?"
2363,"Not saying they are wrong (i truly hope they are right) just that this is shitty lazy journalism, the same type that spread so much fear in the opposite direction when the pandemic started."
2364,My brother's best friend was a pretty healthy 35-year old who died two months ago from it.
2365,I'm ok being sick if I avoid that.
2366,I'll just plan on not doing much for a few days after it.
2367,Are your guys states start to have vax appointments sit as opposed to snapped up in seconds?
2368,Florida has a bunch of vaccine appointments through Walmart Winn Dixie and cvs just sitting with availability.
2369,I’m perplexed.

2380,Lol if someone is underweight do they spread is less then?
2381,"&gt; what really matters is that I treat them as I would hope to be treated

One person told you their moral code."
2382,They didn't say you should change yours.
2383,well they showed people at a columbus ohio clinic getting it
2384,Day 32 after first jab sounds earlier than 2 weeks after second jab?
2385,At least here you get jab two after 4-12 weeks after the first.
2386,If you have antibodies they only give one jab because they count actually having the disease as jab 1.
2387,&gt;Have you ever used the bus to transport home groceries for a family of four?
2388,"So first, there is a ""food desert"", which sounds like a place with no food."
2389,"Then, it turns out there is food, but not enough fresh food."
2390,"Then, it turns out there is healthy food, but you'd have to drive 1.5 miles or take the bus or an Uber."
2391,"Now finally we find that the term ""food desert"" means ""Area with a small percentage of people who have no car and have no way of accessing one and who need to bring home a large amount of groceries on the bus by themselves and don't like the inconvenience of dealing with that""."
2392,"""Food desert"" is a propaganda term."

2394,"When someone is using a clearly wildly exaggerated expression, they are trying to manipulate you."
2395,people of all ages are dying from covid.

2398,yeah 100% agree.
2399,I disagree with 99% of reddit politics but I can understand why someone might think X is the best policies etc etc.
2400,I might strongly disagree and think it's bad policy but I can at least see where someone is coming from.
2401,sadly most just say you're wrong and don't even bother seeing it from someone else's POV.
2402,it's sad that is what society has come to nowadays.
2403,Yah but 100 percent capacity and no mask mandates is too extreme.
2404,Still way too many new cases and deaths.
2405,Carbs are cheap and t2 diabetes is genetic.
2406,"Blaming people for being ""lazy"" when they have bad genetics/metabolisms is not a good approach."
2407,Europeans for centuries talk down to other cultures.

2410,You got an actual argument in there or are we just airing grievances?
2411,"eh, i wouldn’t say ridiculous"
2412,No it shouldn't be unless your sick
2413,Is anyone else disappointed with the way Covid ended?
2414,Someone should tell the writers about Chekhov's hydroxychloroquine.
2415,I haven't heard that vaccinated people can still spread it.
2416,"Everyone I know that has gotten a vaccine has been told to keep masking/distancing when possible for the next couple months or so, just because out in public it'll be hard to enforce who has actually gotten the shot and who is lying about it to evade the restrictions"
2417,"UV rays kill the virus, but it's not instant."
2418,Air flow also helps outdoors.
2419,To say that it doesn't spread outdoors at all would be false though.
2420,It's just far less likely and probably requires someone to be too close for comfort or very unlucky.
2421,That didn't answer the question.
2422,Please re-read.

2432,You'll also have a lot of people want J&amp;J for no other reason than 1 vaccine versus 2 vaccines.
2433,My first dose was a leftover dose.

2457,If you qualify you can go sign up at Rite Aid.
2458,They are not restricting it to only people who are over 65.
2459,I'm just asking is because last thing we we don't need anti-science people teaching NYC kids.
2460,No shit?

2468,"The flip side of this is that I am anxious as fuck about us fucking it up: we don't get the vaccines that we were promised, people don't take the vaccines they're offered, the COVID variants will fuck us, Ted Cruz is actually a COVID variant personified, etc."
2469,Do you guys have things you tell yourself to get past these thoughts?
2470,Are you making tentative plans for summer 2021?
2471,Yeah better “safe than sorry” by letting thousands more people die weekly for months who could otherwise by vaccinated.
2472,What events would you say are more significant?
2473,9/11?
2474,Vietnam?
2475,Dissolution of the Soviet Union?
2476,Indian independence?
2477,Sgt Pepper?
2478,I've probably missed something obvious!
2479,People are going to skip the line and they are jerks and in the grand scheme of things most are playing by the rules so excessive restrictions and documentation would delay more appropriate vaccinations than prevent line jumpers so sometimes you have to chalk it up to personal responsibility and not throw the baby out with the bath water
2480,Got my first shot of Pfizer this morning.
2481,Took all of 2 seconds.
2482,Isn't that the general idea?

2499,"Second of all, it has been know for around a decade that masks work to slow the transmission of respiratory viruses."
2500,It was proved in SARS.
2501,The CDC saying masks work was misinformation *by their own admission* because they didn’t want people to start hoarding.
2502,"It’s *technically* debatable if that was a good idea but, in reality, Public Health 101 is having a transparent, honest message so it’s ultimately pretty clearly a *terrible idea*."
2503,Like.. People must be able to see the connection between public health officials lying to the public and the public’s distrust of public health officials.
2504,It’s a straight line connecting the two.
2505,Lol stop
2506,What are you going to do if you go into a store and they insist you wear a mask to shop there?
2507,"Macron said it, the complete desaster that is the British media ran with it, British people thought it was a big deal, no one else cared, the end."
2508,Tag probably shouldn’t be vaccine news but whatever
2509,You aren't putting anyone at a significant risk by taking your mask off quickly for a few sips of water.
2510,"Well, most of the teachers (55 or less than 55 years old) in Madrid are vaccinated (or going to be vaccinated) In the place where I'm doing the internships everyone went to have the vaccine (or are going to go, today was the last day they were called to go) 

The thing is people aren't sure about the vaccine but when they have the chance to get vaccinated they do it (or thats what I believe)"

2520,Apparently covid is done there lol
2521,Yeah seems it’s not a popular thing to say on this sub though lol.
2522,I’m sorry but I’m young and healthy and been basically a prisoner in my house for a year now while it seems like everyone else has been living it up and not caring one bit about my safety or anyone else’s so I don’t feel guilty about it.
2523,I will still wear masks wherever it’s required for however long it’s required but other than that it’s time for me to start slowly easing back into living life again.
2524,If it’s about greater good more ppl should be vaccinated.
2525,Obese ppl aren’t more likely to catch Covid though I guess they’re often gasping for breath so they might inhale more virus bodies if they encounter them.
2526,A healthy person is just as likely to contract the virus as an obese person.
2527,It’s just that someone who is obese is less likely to survive because they have so much fat already compressing their lungs.
2528,That’s not to say Covid is a death sentence to the obese.
2529,There are also plenty of healthy ppl who succumb.
2530,If we want a larger population to survive vaccinate more ppl.
2531,Spending more vaccine to vaccinate fewer ppl makes no sense
2532,"Risk of spread is far minimal, yes!"
2533,"However, I live in a major metropolitan area, so I'm more likely to be around larger groups of people at any given time."
2534,And while I'll be vaccinated by the summer -- first appointment next week -- it's still important to carry out the perception of wearing a mask for awhile for those who are unvaccinated.
2535,Is this a bad faith question by someone who has a divisive us versus them agenda (anti-mitigation vs pro-mitigation)?
2536,This argument has been made a million times since mitigation changes started in April and I haven't seen WFH people arguing points like that for months.
2537,Thankfully I'm 13 days away from my 2nd Moderna shot.
2538,"I work with some folks that refuse to wear mask even though we are supposed to it just isn't enforced but that is on upper management but yeah, I'm ready to end this."
2539,There is no evidence whatsoever that immunity from the vaccine fades that quickly
2540,It's crazy to think the US has 1/5 of the deaths in the entire world

2655,"You can show all the models you want saying if X% wore masks, there'd be Y% fewer deaths, but where is the real world data showing that?"
2656,"Oklahoma, Florida, etc."
2657,haven't required masks and are doing better than states that do (in deaths per million).
2658,"Western European countries like France and Spain have 90+% mask adoption, but it's in the 20-30% range for Nordic countries and yet Nordic countries have significantly better results."

2668,"This is why I say that ""food desert"" is a bullshit term."

2682,You're making things up my dude.
2683,Cases in NY in Dec-Feb were all higher than your 'peak' in April20.
2684,There's a lot of interesting aspects to this - and I don't think we need to get it too political like you seem to be.
2685,"Population density, interdependence of communities, and even things like car access/travel all have impacts in NY way more than OK. That's fine."
2686,"Most of the time, the snapbacks in cases happened after a big spike but prior to restrictions showing that the populace chose to restrict themselves without the government requiring it."
2687,"Either way, Oklohama is in the bottom 20% of all states with one of the worst healthcare systems to begin with."

2748,That's my goal for this spring and summer and probably many others' as well.
2749,Full normal can wait but no more absolutist social distancing.
2750,The mask mandate may be lifted but private businesses will still require masks sadly.
2751,I see us having to carry around masks till the end of this year unfortunately.
2752,There’s zero evidence that it’s a different story in humans.
2753,The statement is little more than wishful thinking.
2754,Evidence on the ground strongly points to this variant being the worst one to have evolved so far.
2755,Early in vitro lab studies support this.
2756,This is a zoonotic disease and the Amazon rainforest has limitless potential for wildlife reservoirs and every jump from humans to animals results in more mutation than human to human transmission.
2757,"Every species jump, like bat to cat, does this to a greater degree."
2758,Cities in and around the Amazon have TONS of wet markets with countless species of super stressed out animals mixing with huge ~~gunners~~ numbers of people = a recipe for disaster.
2759,The Amazon is getting revenge on humanity for all the horrific clear cutting and wanton destruction of life.
2760,It makes sense the worst variant so far comes from a place where humanity is continuing to commit environmental atrocities every single day.

2769,If they think immunocompromised puts pressure on the virus could they work to get those people vaccinated?
2770,"Either they didn’t test in America or where they did, the volunteers tended not to be obese."
2771,I didn’t really think about it until now but there are interviews with ppl who volunteered.
2772,Obviously a small section of the group but I don’t recall any of them being obese.
2773,I would also say that those who volunteered were from mid-to high socio-economic backgrounds.
2774,Basically those who have the time.
2775,They were also within a certain age range which meant that in some countries they won’t use vaccines not tested on the elderly on senior citizens.
2776,All these factors meant much fewer obese ppl volunteered compared to their representation within the population.

2778,My fiance got one because she worked at a mask decontamination site.
2779,I'm super jealous
2780,They also don’t spread the virus as bad or get effected that badly either.
2781,If they get it they get better but with adults protected there’s  not as much to worry about.
2782,Under 12 and around vaccinated parents and teachers leaves them in a pretty good place until studies finish.
2783,Once studies finish they’ll have to prove their vaccinated as well or no school.
2784,I don't disagree.

2793,"There are still people who are way into it, probably millions of them, but there are still people who write angry letters about how television shows desecrate family values or how video games encourage violence in children."
2794,"We collectively stopped taking them seriously a long, long time ago since they're such a tiny amount of the population, and I really do feel that we're getting to that point with the equal but opposite end of that extreme."
2795,After a while people get tired of playing along.
2796,It happens every time.
2797,"These attempts at social control generally result in a pendulum or rubber banding type effect where the complaining groups have social dominance for some time, but eventually a majority of the population gets so tired of them telling them what they can and can't say that it becomes ""cool"" and even morally upright to go out of your way to irritate them."
2798,And I don't think people will ever pick up on the pattern because it just keeps happening.
2799,"Dude same I started lurking in here around 250,00"
2800,It's been very interesting watching the uber conservative Catholics squirm with a somewhat progressive Pope.
2801,Read my COVID-19 fan fiction!
2802,I'm also very antsy for summer.
2803,The cold front that is literally blowing through New York and the east coast right now helped bring me back to earth.
2804,"I'm okay staying inside a little longer, seeing as it feels like it's 15 degrees outside."
2805,"What's getting me through all this: Even **IF** \- big big big IF we don't get the vaccines we were promised, or not enough people get it, etc."
2806,etc.
2807,"- last summer, numbers were very very low in most places."
2808,The reason why everything was closed and we didn't do much is because we knew so little about the virus.
2809,Now if I see the positivity rate is consistently at .9%?
2810,I'll feel infinitely more comfortable going out and living life.
2811,And now we have a vaccine!
2812,Three of em!
2813,"For me, the main thing I tell myself is that we will (hopefully) never get this situation again."
2814,"So when I miss work, I remind myself that waking up at 8am is pretty damn awesome."
2815,"When I'm stuck inside on a Friday night (during winter), I remind myself that life moves very fast and it's sometimes nice to relax and watch a movie I've never seen... or try a new hobby."
2816,"When I miss my friends, especially those out of state, I shoot em' a text and talk about plans for the summer."
2817,"I am not planning any outright travel, but yes..."
2818,I totally plan on getting out and enjoying life this summer.
2819,We all deserve it.
2820,I understand the sentiment but I’m hoping mask wearing will continue post pandemic for when people have the cold or flu or allergies.
2821,I don’t want people sneezing all over me either or spreading their colds so that I end up sick too.
2822,They’re expecting 20M by end of March I thought.
2823,[deleted]
2824,You nailed it.
2825,"Some things were already in motion, the pandemic sped it up."
2826,Are we going back to theaters and plays and movies and sporting events and bars and restaurants and cruises and fun stuff?
2827,Absolutely.
2828,"And...a small percentage will change where they spend their time and money (your time and money will be spent in TN), and that will shape parts of the world."
2829,"Enjoy Tennessee, beautiful country, good food, lots to do within driving distance around the region."
2830,"I mean, if we're going to be pedantic, cases aren't actually decreasing at the national level--they've stagnated over the last week."
2831,"Hospitalizations are continuing to decrease, but they're still very high."
2832,Same with deaths.
2833,"I don't think anyone can stay home for another year, but I do think it would be a good idea to hold off another six weeks before we begin to reopen in earnest."
2834,"The virus is so contagious that we need a HUGE portion of the population vaccinated for herd immunity to actually take hold, and we're just not there yet."
2835,Dad gets his vax Wednesday!
2836,This trains finally rolling!
2837,Can’t wait to get mine folks but I’m 31 so going to have to wait a bit
2838,"PA's 7 day average increased 4 days in a row, but today it has started to decrease again, and we have 302 less hospitalizations compared to 6 days ago."
2839,Amazing.
2840,"Saw a poll recently, not sure how accurate it is, that a majority of Germans now are supporting loosening of pandemic related orders."
2841,It seems that there the public will for Pandemic mode life is starting to dwindle.
2842,"I'm German, live in the East Coast US- cousin's in Leipzig."
2843,Literally all she's been able to do is ride her bike for like the past 5 months lol.
2844,Gets old.
2845,I wonder what international travel is going to look like.
2846,I got married last June.
2847,We cancelled our wedding and honeymoon because of covid but got married at city hall with one witness.
2848,Our honeymoon was to Scotland to introduce my wife to my family.
2849,Now we are wondering if we can go in July.
2850,If you asked me last month I would have said unlikely but things are getting better in both countries and I think by summer everything may be fully open.
2851,If we don't go this summer its unlikely we go next.
2852,"Then again I want my wife to experience Scotland how to should be, not partly closed."
2853,True.
2854,"If only we had formed an alliance, instead of tearing Germany in two..."
2855,Kansas and North Carolina both have 5 phases.
2856,I know every state is slightly different.
2857,I am so envious when I read English speaking subs discussing coronavirus.
2858,Here in Brazil we are not feeling optimistic.
2859,That sounds cool
2860,I don't think a lot of people would return for dose #2 at that point.
2861,Let's just stay the course...
2862,ESPECIALLY now that we have a single shot vaccine at our disposal
2863,"Ah, pcr testing here is free, and 24 hours normally with a max of 48."
2864,"Same with my wife, an otherwise healthy nurse in her early 30s."
2865,She spent yesterday in the ER because her 2nd vaccine dose aggravated her long-COVID symptoms to the point her coworkers (doctors in a pediatric practice) called 911.
2866,"Nothing like pacing around outside a hospital for hours while your wife is inside, alone, struggling to breathe."
2867,"But to the ""LIBERATE APPLEBEES!"""
2868,"crowd, either you're in the 1% dead or it's totally fine."
2869,"The COVID vaccine, especially Pfizer and Moderna’s mRNA vaccines, are pretty fickle to transport, store, unfreeze, and manage in a reasonable timeframe for lots of people."
2870,"It has to be kept extremely cold until gently thawing it to room temperature right when the person needs it, so time management is crucial especially in larger operations."
2871,But if you ask it as yes no or maybe the answer will 1000% be maybe.
2872,Every scientist researcher and engineer I’ve ever worked with refuses to deal in absolutes.
2873,We learned our lesson when we declared physics over in the late 1800s.
2874,"When they made a Jesuit the pope, it was clear nothing good would come of it!"
2875,/s
2876,"Keep in mind they are only delivering just under 10 million doses to the US in March and North Carolina's share of that would be about 3% or around 300,000 doses for the state."
2877,Because of course.
2878,"Agreed - but out of interest, and seriously - point out the part where I have posted anything that wasn't a fact (ignore opinions about what is and isn't a personal attack)."
2879,All I did was post a statement by the presidential spokeperson that was reported in the Canadian press.
2880,I don't really see the point of carrying on a feud on ths thread.
2881,Wow someone's really fun at parties
2882,It's the worry that you may still be able carry enough of the virus to spread it to other non vaccinated people.
2883,The differences are negligible and played up by the media.
2884,"Wales is like 1% ahead of England, who are like 1% ahead of Scotland."
2885,Either way on a national level we're doing fantastically well.
2886,I might actually cry happy tears when I get mine.
2887,Then (since it wont be until the summer) straight to the pub.
2888,No they’re not supposed to be suspended during a pandemic.
2889,"Not saying that they shouldn’t be, but you’re just straight fabricating facts about the TRIPS agreement that do not exist."
2890,"&gt;**Pharmaceutical companies BioNTech and Pfizer are delivering substantially more vaccines than expected in a short time, outgoing Health Minister Hugo de Jonge wrote on Twitter on Tuesday."
2891,"Starting in April, the Netherlands will receive half a million vaccine doses every week from the pharma companies, whereas initially over 200,000 doses per week were expected in that month."
2892,"**  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;""This ensures that we can once again speed up the vaccination process,"" De Jonge writes, without going into details."
2893,"&gt;  
&gt;Spokespersons for the Ministry of Health and Pfizer report in conversation with [NU.nl](https://NU.nl) that the sped up deliveries do not change the promised quantity of vaccines in the second quarter: that remains 7.8 million."
2894,"According to the spokespersons, only more has become clear about how quickly these vaccine doses are expected; that planning had not yet been completely worked out."
2895,"&gt;  
&gt;Last weekend, figures from the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) already showed that, compared to other EU countries, the Netherlands is setting more and more pricks."
2896,"By holding back less supply, the Netherlands has stormed into the top four of the list of EU countries in administering the first vaccine dose."
2897,"&gt;  
&gt;When looking at the percentage of adults fully vaccinated against COVID-19, the Netherlands is still doing a lot less than other EU member states."
2898,"This could change within three to six weeks, however, when all persons who have had a first shot can receive a second shot according to schedule."
2899,Time to take up smoking.
2900,"&gt; They have vaccinated by far the most in the world at 94.88% of their population

You're looking at the wrong stat, they've given about 90 doses per 100 population so far, but each patient requires two doses, so they aren't at anywhere near 90% coverage."
2901,They're also doing the shorter 4 week spacing between first and second vaccines I think.
2902,"So there are still a lot of people in Israel who haven't had any vaccine yet, or had their first dose within the last few weeks and as such haven't built up immunity yet."
2903,I guess I should've worded it better.
2904,I meant more like on larger scale where when this is over that people wearing masks when they want to being jerks about those who don't/
2905,It's like the last hour of a long plane or car trip.
2906,"We made travel plans for June, going to get an AirBnB in another city for a few weeks."
2907,"Worst case, we get a change of scenery."
2908,"Best case, things are wide open!"
2909,It's something to look forward to.
2910,I’ll still be here because I’m a geeky perpetually indoor hermit
2911,"12 and up are, but no trials for below that age yet."
2912,Good.
2913,Even people joking about that stuff reinforces the people who believe it.
2914,"READ THE STANDING ORDERS RSQFree, read them and UNDERSTAND THEM."
2915,I wish more people would answer this way when answering outside their line of expertise.
2916,As it should be.
2917,"Even at it's most selfish core, immunizing as much of the planet as possible is an economic and, frankly, national security issue and it should be discussed as such."
2918,"Doesn't matter that it happens, being set on the course towards hegemony leads to competition and is the critical element."
2919,"In 50 years, no one will be basing their international posture on COVID."
2920,"God, I fucking hope."
2921,I just want to fucking hug my grandfather.
2922,&gt; More and more everyday it feels like we’ll be back to normal sometime this ~~summer~~ spring.
2923,"Yeah, absolutely agree."
2924,"Like you said, people are finding everything possible to get tribal and us versus them about and it makes it much harder for us to function as a society with people viewing so many others as extreme enemies."
2925,"We should understand people have varying points of view and just accept that and try our best to get along and when there isn't a way to compromise (and sometimes it makes no sense to even try to compromise, like how do you compromise with someone supporting genocide and political based mass killings), agree to disagree and just vote accordingly."
2926,We're nowhere near that state right now.
2927,"We can see plenty of examples in other countries past and present of people killing other groups based on things that seem petty to us here and now, but we are not at all immune to that level of tribalism that leads to such destructive extremism."
2928,"Not sure, that’s not shown in the tweets."
2929,I didn’t dig through the entire data dump.
2930,Just go to a vaccination site at the end of the day for a walk-in... they almost always have extra doses from missed appointments during the day that they’d love to give you
2931,"No authority at all, Jackie Weaver!"
2932,I think you generally misunderstood what I said.
2933,"I was talking about population level, overall results."
2934,"The CDC study is data from June and July, and from a cursory glance their conclusion was that counties that implemented mask mandates saw decreases in that period while counties that did not saw increases."
2935,"The study also shows that while the counties that implemented them were fewer in number, they were larger in population."
2936,So the urban counties experienced decreases after implementation and rural counties experienced increases at the same time.
2937,Again I'll point out that correlation =/= causation.
2938,It logically makes sense that the urban areas could have been hit first and were experiencing decreases due to already having been hit while rural areas were just beginning to being hit.
2939,"For example, here are the counties that implemented the mask mandate according to the CDC document and in parentheses their ranking in terms of deaths per million of Kansas counties:

Allen (91), Atchison (71), Bourbon (88), Crawford (32), Dickinson (38), Douglas (78), Franklin (50), Geary (74), Gove (1), Harvey (43), Jewell (64), Johnson (63), Mitchell (98), Montgomery (89), Morris (9), Pratt (21), Reno (34), Republic (17), Saline (41), Scott (6), Sedgwick (67), Shawnee (40), Stanton (66) and Wyandotte (47)."
2940,Average ranking is 51st in deaths per million in a state with 105 counties.
2941,"So again, overall, the counties that implemented mask mandates did not perform better in the long run."
2942,"They performed on average, *slightly worse* than counties that did not implement a mask mandate."
2943,"Incoming category 5 ""devil is already here"" Covid hurricane"

2946,I feel like everyday it’s something different.
2947,Tomorrow someone will say vaccines don’t stop transmission.
2948,Wouldn’t be shocked if the user you’re arguing against is a former denizen of fatpeoplehate.
2949,You see threads from time to time with the disgusting attitude that subreddit encouraged.
2950,No you are incorrect - Trump and the previous administration discussed this during Q&amp;A back in the summer.
2951,They all knew supplies would be lacking and some would have to work together.
2952,I realize you hate trump but some credit is due cause it was clearly discussed and started to plan months ago.
2953,Biden didn't do anything here but announce it.
2954,"Well with continued news like this, it will be!"
2955,"Now whether we have uptick in cases after the first parties of the summer (let's be honest the parties never truly go away), may determine how much we bear down again."
2956,"It won't be nearly as bad as last year, but hopefully it will be so much better the new cases will be a blip instead of a month-long reigning in after each spike."
2957,I'm still not going to the beaches for awhile.
2958,"I'm already terrified of sea animals, the thought of them running around close shore without humans stomping around for so long scares me more than rona this year."
2959,People would still have hoarded N95s etc.
2960,If I've learned anything the past year is that a lot of people DGAF about the general health.
2961,"same could be said about any place with british variant,  the spread of variants depends on how infectious they are and british is really high, possibly higher than brasilian or SA variant, now question as you say is how aquired imunity would work against those"
2962,"How hard would that be to enact, do you think?"
2963,Considering emergencies and such.
2964,It seems very split even in my very blue area of the country.
2965,65% of people seem to be quickly returning to their normal lives.
2966,About 35% are still in stay-at-home mode and only go out to get groceries.
2967,I imagine the latter group will slowly dwindle in size over the next month or two.
2968,"Not being able to drive over the speed limit is a little different then people not being able to do something they evolved for millions of years to do, socialize."
2969,Look at that sweet UK case &amp; death decline and the data coming from there..   Clearly the FDA pulled the wrong rein by not delaying 2nd doses.
2970,"They can't say ""Oops"" now though..  it will reflect badly on them and probably too late anyway."
2971,Well I'm not concerned about that at all.
2972,Many of the countries I want to visit are already allowing tourists.
2973,"I just don't want to go and have everything be closed (tourist attractions, bars, restaurants, etc)."
2974,Would be a total waste of a trip if I went and everything was closed.
2975,"&gt; And ~~might I direct your attention to~~ what about how the government does bad things to unrelated people now can i inject people with an experimental vaccine

Vaccines for COVID-19 will start out being used under an Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) by the FDA."
2976,An EUA makes the vaccine available for public health emergencies.
2977,It means that the vaccine is available outside of a research study but is not yet approved.
2978,This is the usual first step for a new vaccine.
2979,The vaccine can continue to be used as long as people benefit from it.
2980,The research continues as it moves toward full approval.
2981,I miss the library
2982,"Or, tell it to the people *in this very thread* who are saying we shouldn't ease restrictions, otherwise it'll be a disaster

You can't ease restrictions if they don't exist, right?"
2983,Every country can verify and asses whether the find the results sufficient for rollout.
2984,EMA has nothing to do with national approval.
2985,"Also, South-Korea and Japan have limited AZ vaccine for exactly the same reason many in the EU have."
2986,"In 2-3 months it'll be almost summer and considering how low cases dropped last year, even without the vaccines?"
2987,"Yeah, that's not happening."
2988,China stops exports of items when it benefits them.
2989,I was not talking about vaccines specifically.
2990,Someone else commenting knew I was referring to the masks last year.
2991,[removed]
2992,"They lifted ours last week, here in Ada county Idaho."
2993,Fact is no one knows 100% what factors play a role and how much each factor plays a role.
2994,There's literally hundreds of factors you'd have to consider and plenty of unknowns.
2995,Anyone who says otherwise is just making shit up.
2996,Net York’s quarantine was a joke too.
2997,It’s all self reported.
2998,I went in January.
2999,Know how hard it is to have ready 100+million little bottles and other supplies to put this stuff in?
3000,It was long discussed last summer about the shortfalls of all that to get some to work together.
3001,The mask acne is the worst!!
3002,It was so bad during the summer for me when I was sweating.. I’m dreading this summer and am really hoping they will tell us that we don’t have to wear them.
3003,"i don’t think they should be socializing now, but once the majority of adult are vaccinated, then yes."
3004,"I can't read French so can't check, but it seems exceedingly unlikely the President of a country makes such a rash comment about a vaccine and it goes unreported by the media in that country."
3005,"Exactly, it's all about how this information again."
3006,"We're waiting so we can get this done and over with, not just to keep punishing people."
3007,"That said, these messages need to get passed onto the governors since they're the ones actually in charge."
3008,I’m just going to say it... if you don’t treat the people who grow/wash/store/prep/cook your food.
3009,You deserve some diarrhea.
3010,"Hey, an optimist!"
3011,I agree but no such law exists and won’t.
3012,Where are you getting this information?
3013,I live here and the demand for vaccines is through the roof.
3014,"Too little, too late, my friend"
3015,You are reading it wrong.
3016,A little over 50 pct have had a first dose.
3017,The rest of that 90 is second doses.
3018,Also keep in mind it takes a few weeks to get immune.
3019,This was discussed back last summer to get them to work together for supply purposes.
3020,"It was highly known that supplies to put them in, store and so on was gonna be difficult to keep up with till this point and they would need to assist each other so make sure to give credit where credit is due."
3021,Sooooo just got my second dose of the pfizer vaccine.
3022,"Glad it's finally over for me but not exactly looking forward to the next few days since I had a reaction of mild chills/headache/fever for a few days after the first, and the second is supposed to be worse."
3023,"So uh, yeah."
3024,I don't particularly mind getting a couple free days off of work though.
3025,I feel your pain.
3026,I've had a massive south/central america trip planned since what feels like fucking FOREVER.
3027,"And honestly, I feel like they might lag 90-180 days in vaccinations/reopening behind the developed world."
3028,And the majority of those countries are developing.
3029,Looks like we'll have to wait :(
3030,And so does anxiety.
3031,Catch 22 right there lol
3032,I loved seeing the trees in Balboa park
3033,"Oh boy, You shouldn't always believe what you think -that's the problem with America today."
3034,A whole lot of opinions based on zero facts and critical thinking.
3035,People just parroting what they red in a meme that seems to agree with their previously adopted opinion.
3036,I'll take experts' opinions over idiots who whine about being inconvenienced because their favorite dive bar is closed.
3037,[deleted]
3038,It’s the only choice we have
3039,[deleted]
3040,Yeah I'm from NY and no one knows what the heck is going on.
3041,Cuomo botched the nursing home situation.
3042,His own staff are starting to admit it.
3043,The deaths were completely downplayed.
3044,I live with my 4 sons and they're dad and I try my best to disinfect the toilet seat and sink and counter tops in the bathroom because 2 of my sons are essential workers and so is they're dad.
3045,My youngest goes to school.
3046,This is his last year.
3047,"I've disinfected and wash my hands so much that my tips of my fingers are irritated from it, but I don't wish to catch this virus again!"
3048,Not when I don't go any place.
3049,NYC is planning to use it on folks who can’t leave their house for the same reasons
3050,Your body was working hard to make antibodies!
3051,That's very clearly not happening.
3052,"COVID is with us for good, just like the flu."
3053,Vaccinated people can spread it too.
3054,[removed]
3055,Damn that sucks.
3056,"Essential manufacturing counts as 1b in Virginia, and since they ask whether you are within 6ft of others I am assuming there’s sub tiers in there."
3057,"I didn’t know what to put, I’m not allowed within 6ft of others but we also aren’t allowed to lift equipment over 35lbs without a second guy."
3058,I was joking that we need some of those poles from the ark of the covenant.
3059,"Regardless, I’m 1b and expecting a call someday to go in"
3060,And Disneyland in California just cancelled the AP program so that already will take a good chunk off the visitors since a majority of their attendance are AP holders
3061,You can't cure stupid.
3062,"If you can't make vaccines work, then you can't cure stupid."
3063,My dad completely lost hearing in one of his ears following his second dose (MODERNA).
3064,It has been three days and there has been no improvement.
3065,"He went in for a checkup and his doctor said he has never seen this reaction in any of his patients, but as my dad was leaving to go home the doctor found him and said they just had another patient come in with the same symptoms (deafness in one ear)."
3066,Has anyone experienced anything similar?
3067,We are very concerned this may become permanent.
3068,[removed]
3069,Kudos to you.
3070,I lasted a grand total of 4 hours in food service.
3071,Some lady yelled at me because I wouldn’t break food safety protocol for her and I cried.
3072,I agree.
3073,"Even though I know most of the time it’s 100% fine to eat food someone prepared without a mask or gloves, it still feels safer when they’re wearing a mask and not breathing on things."
3074,I work retail so I have enjoyed wearing a mask at work so I can secretly cuss someone out under my breath and I don’t have to worry about them getting spittle on my face if they yell at me.
3075,My skin stays dry year round regardless of temperature or humidity.
3076,It’s miserable.
3077,I do miss wearing thick goopy moisturizing masks to my night shifts though.
3078,Those don’t go well with masks.
3079,They’ll probably let you in and need to see your vaccine card as a condition of your visa like they do with yellow fever.
3080,Many anti-vax people are hypocrites and will secretly get the vaccine.
3081,They show up to rant against them for their anti-vax friends but are first in line when it's offered.
3082,It's one of the things that makes it so frustrating.
3083,"I always say, if someone doesn't want the vaccine, fine, don't get it."
3084,But don't try to keep others from it nor spread misinformation.
3085,"It's their decision, not yours."
3086,I just want to go to Seattle and watch Mike trout hit a homerun out of T-Mobile park!
3087,I just want to go to Kansas City and see Mike trout hit a home run off Kaufman stadium!

3098,That is not the case.

3103,It's great that your doctor thinks you're healthy.
3104,Some people are luckier than others when it comes to experiencing the side-effects of excessive weight.
3105,"But it will probably catch up with you eventually, and even if it doesn't, there's a danger to normalising something that is harmful to a lot of people."
3106, No.
3107,You are right.
3108,And I agree with you fully
3109,"For age - Florida is the 5th oldest state by median age in the country and is much higher than its surrounding states, which have all done worse by Covid death numbers."
3110,You would think an elderly population would lead to a higher death rate.
3111,"I can't speak to any other of those differences, I haven't really seen any other statistics breaking those down."
3112,Why?
3113,Spain has the same regulations that Germany and France have with regard to AZ vaccine.
3114,Which is what you are referring about.
3115,"&gt; Spain rules out administering AstraZeneca vaccine to over-65s

&gt; The age limit– which could even be lowered to 55 – means that the country will need to review its current vaccination plan to prioritize other vulnerable groups or essential workers

3146,"I prefer eradication over herd immunity, especially in case of a novel pathogen which causes systemic disease."
3147,"And China has successfully controlled the virus and has saved its citizens from death and misery so yeah, I'm gonna believe them over US/EU."
3148,You called me a bot but you aren't very bright are you?
3149,"SARS spread via feces, and covid19 has the potential to do the same."
3150,It's done so in animal studies.
3151,"China is set on eradication, so they are doing everything they can to eliminate the virus."
3152,They can't afford to miss even one case bc that'll start the chain again.
3153,"Must be difficult concept for you to understand, what's with the approach your country is taking."

3156,"I'm here in Vietnam, we just had our third and largest outbreak, I think the total number of infections remained under 400."
3157,"I could be a bit off though, because restrictions were reinstated and it got under control pretty quickly like the previous times with much less impact on daily life than it seems most other countries had to resort to after letting things get out of hand, so frankly most of the people I know aren't glued to the news about it like people in the west."
3158,"I admit I'm one of those people, though I'm from America so I still see daily news of the horror show over there."
3159,"Vietnam borders China, Cambodia, and Laos."
3160,It has major ports connecting many countries in the crowded region of the world it sits in the middle of and diaspora+student communities around the globe whose return the gov has handled well.
3161,"Even if real numbers were ten times higher than my estimate, or ten times higher than the likely number reported after I stopped checking the numbers daily, Vietnam kicked ass at this from start to finish."
3162,And nobody got welded inside their apartment or tracked with invasive phone apps.
3163,It came down almost entirely to people's willingness to follow best practices.
3164,So I don't buy for a moment this notion that it's only islands or countries bordering hermit kingdoms that managed to pull it off.
3165,Vietnam was proactive and had a plan in place after the first SARS scare illuminated the fact that their national healthcare system couldn't handle the inundation that a pandemic would cause.
3166,It turns out that rich countries really couldn't handle that deluge either.
3167,"You don't have to be an island, or relatively isolated, or even rich (though too be fair to you, you never said that) to have done well in all of this."
3168,"You just needed a plan, decisiveness in policy making, and a population that would listen to reason."
3169,Yeah I'm pro vax and got my 2 doses or whatever but what's going on here?
3170,Why hasn't isreal's case count dropped dramatically considering how many people they've vaccinated?
3171,Why are people still testing positive?
3172,Are there any counterexamples to what's going on there?
3173,"No it wasn't - it's just the result of this sub being overrun with anti-lockdown, anti-science, 'fatigued' complainers."
3174,"Now, in hindsight - having closed the beaches early during the pandemic was just the powers that be wanting to arbitrarily punish them."
3175,"The same way trying any mitigation strategies now is a waste, because it's never going to end, it's only being done to screw people, or any one of a number of nonsensical claims being made by the unwashed masses."

3177,"Yeah, sure I agree to wait on that."
3178,Don’t downvote me but shouldn’t we take the variants into consideration?
3179,Didn’t they say it can cause a surge again?
3180,Anyone want to explain to me like I’m 5?
3181,"By the government, not the companies."
3182,And we send Israel and Egypt like 5 BN a year just to not fight each other.
3183,We've already pledged 1bn to Covax.
3184,This is different from the Spanish flu.
3185,We weren't as global of a community back then.
3186,It was rare for people to fly to the other side of the world back then.
3187,"Now, it's commonplace."
3188,"I think you're going to see large changes in public health, changes in how people act when they are ill."
3189,It used to be common to go to work when you were clearly sick or send obviously sick kids to school.
3190,"There will be changes in the way people work, changes in travel and screening for people crossing borders, changes to education, changes to how the world reacts to infections or possible pandemics."
3191,"5 years from now, I can guarantee that the average country's budget for handling pandemics will dwarf what it was in 2019."
3192,It is a defining moment and it's not localized to a single location.
3193,"This virus wasn't worse than the Spanish flu, but the world is different from what it was back then."
3194,This was the first modern pandemic and it used the way our world is to help spread and cause more damage.
3195,"If the the COVID19 virus had been released into the world a hundred years ago instead of the Spanish flu, it wouldn't have had nearly the same impact."
3196,The Spanish flu in a world where someone can travel from New York to Australia in a day would have been devastating.
3197,And you can bet that will be figured into future pandemic spending and planning.
3198,The COVID19 virus wasn't actually that bad.
3199,"So, what happens if a virus that is so much worse gets unleashed on our modern world."
3200,You can bet that people are going to worry about that and want their governments to plan and put money toward fighting that possibility from becoming a reality.
3201,God I hate the dry skin makeup flakes I get in the winter.
3202,Mask wearing has aggravated my acne but thankfully I get to just cover it up!
3203,I also work in food and it feels more sanitary in general to wear masks.
3204,&gt;Will anyone here stop wearing a mask when you’re vaccinated?
3205,hell yes!
3206,i've got the vaccine and my patience for masks is at 0. the only reason i ever wear one is because it's required at work.
3207,I'm not on chodi or indiaspeaks brother.
3208,Using hindi words to abuse me to bypass this sub's rules?
3209,"Coward, as expected of someone from randia."

3212,"one huge problem is that in the 3rd world where HIV is prevalent you've got a huge swath of the population that's technically ""immunocompromised""."
3213,Trying to vaccinate the entirety of Brazil or S. Africa is a HUGE undertaking that will take literally a decade.
3214,"So, the fact is that we'll be facing these mutant strains for years to come."
3215,The public just needs to be on top of their vaccine boosters until this virus becomes as rare as polio.
3216,"Yeah man, it was definitely worth it in my opinion."

3218,Lol
3219,"1,022,450 first doses on todays update."
3220,Highest BY FAR for a Tuesday update.
3221,previous Tuesdays saw about HALF of this.
3222,This doesn't even include J&amp;J yet.
3223,We now have a 5 day rolling average of 1.13 million first doses (Im using 5 days atm because thats when it seems we got back on track post winter storms).
3224,This is such amazing news.
3225,That is very true.
3226,"When I joined the Chicago group there were around 7,000 members and it was much more manageable."
3227,I was able to book a few appointments based on tips I received there.
3228,"The last time I checked there were more than 35,000 members and it seems like the useful posts are fewer and farther between."
3229,"Still worth a look, but I agree that you might do more of your own searching these days."
3230,"Hopefully with the release of the J&amp;J vaccine, we'll soon be in a place where we aren't scrambling to find appointments (or maybe that's just the optimist in me...)"
3231,"I just want to see my family, and hug my best friend."
3232,"Because they’re all out of state (or more accurately, we are out of their state) I haven’t seen any of my friends in 1yr as of this past Sunday."
3233,I don’t think kids should be out there socializing but I just think parents are in a good place to know that their child’s chances of having a rough go at Covid are small without being vaccinated.
3234,That’s a really good thing.
3235,Hmmm I've been told that America first policies were racist.
3236,"I mean, I agree that one should not get children when they are too old."
3237,I just don’t see the connect between that and having a party for 250+ people.
3238,Unless we are talking about an orgy.
3239,Tell that to the owners who lost businesses and people out of work due to various restrictions or shutdowns
3240,Sure.
3241,"That’s a bad question to ask, though, in terms of communicating scientific ideas to the public."
3242,“Maybe” is so vague and universally applicable as to be meaningless.
3243,That’s where shit like “climate change is only a theory” comes from.
3244,"“Yes or no, and with what degree of certainty?” is how predictive questions need to be framed in public discussion."
3245,I got my first dose today
3246,"may, almost."
3247,wtf is that title.
3248,That was a terrible tactic.
3249,"While it might have technically been true that we didn’t know for absolute certain, it would be very unusual that a vaccine would prevent illness almost entirely but still let you shed viruses everywhere."
3250,"Spreading that... maybe lie isn’t the right word, but immensely overly cautious message just discouraged people from getting the vaccine."
3251,"Time for some intermittent fasting, skinny."
3252,"Yeah I wore one for like eight hours when I worked the polls for a special election last summer, in a school that basically had it’s A/C on maintenance mode since school was out."
3253,Not very pleasant lol
3254,Just read an article about an infection in a nursing home.
3255,Second time was worse and killed ppl.
3256,"&gt;I'm literally reposting something Fauci said, why was I smacked down?"
3257,"Well, people can't tell you why, because if they did, they'd be banned."
3258,Fauci #1!
3259,Boy let me introduce you to the amazing place known as r/worldnews
3260,Because a single dose of J&amp;J is effective at preventing hospitalization.
3261,That's better than nothing.
3262,"But as a country we shouldn't settle for ""better than nothing""."
3263,"It's been talked about, some bands are sketchy about it though."
3264,Baby Nationals really can't go out and deal with room caps because the margins are all already pretty tight for them.
3265,Someone might try a fest or two but it's not going to be like normal yet.
3266,"That also suggests the effects may be very nonlinear - if lockdowns dont really work without strong compliance, then a medium-compliance lockdown may not be worth the incredible costs."
3267,"&gt; or if they got very sick from it

And that's the unknown

There isn't enough data on that

You're definitely pulling some big assumptions out of no where."
3268,I was a big proponent for First Doses First strategy.
3269,The math proves  this is the best and most effective strategy.
3270,"However, at this point, at least in the US, we need to ride the horse we rode in on."
3271,I get your point but Florida is a terrible example given that they seem to be trying to hide the real numbers
3272,"Keep getting inoculated, the Golden State."
3273,Then you'll reach herd immunity.
3274,Finally.. something the experts say that I agree with.
3275,I know we’re all tired and fed up.
3276,I am myself.
3277,But the fact is that a lot of states don’t have 10% of the adult population fully vaccinated yet.
3278,Now is not the time to ease restrictions.
3279,Towards the summer months though that is a little more reasonable.
3280,Last we want is the virus to mutate even further and be completely vaccine evasive.
3281,But finally an expert who isn’t saying we will have to wear masks even when we reach herd immunity.
3282,We don't have studies because for some reason pfizer and moderna did not even try.
3283,"Also the good 3M masks are, at least for me, more breathable than cloth masks."
3284, I was a part of the AZ trial and found out I received the vaccine after getting an appointment for the Moderna vaccine.
3285,"(AstraZeneca only ""unblinds"" you only once you have an appointment for a vaccine) With the efficacy of the Moderna vaccine being higher than AZ, especially against variants, should I get the Moderna one too?"
3286,Wait for the boosters later this year?
3287,I've gone back and forth on it.
3288,Let me clarify.
3289,"I’m not eating burgers, burritos etc every day."
3290,It’s more like a couple times a week.
3291,According to my Dr I’m healthy.
3292,"So it’s not a case of here for a good time, not a long time."
3293,I’m not living an extreme lifestyle that will shorten my life.
3294,200 pounds is not a lot for a 40+ year old male.
3295,Which original study?
3296,"Plenty of overweight people were part of many phase III vaccine trials, but in most of them weight wasn’t part of the scope of the study."
3297,They didn’t measure how heavy their participants were.
3298,Yup.
3299,The admin is investing in an American company in the U.S. to develop a vaccine made in the U.S. since we have the domestic manufacturing plants and production capacity/facility.
3300,It's gonna be great.
3301,That’s good to know.
3302,Thank you and I will
3303,[deleted]
3304,I don't miss shaking hands.
3305,Many men don't wash their hands after peeing.
3306,I’m vaccinated and my immediate family will be by end of March.
3307,"Going up to see them in April, first time in over a year."
3308,Air fare was $58 compared to the typical $330.
3309,Get it while it’s hot
3310,"And built to save lives, not boom 'em!"
3311,&gt; Why are you ok with unelected Silicon Valley billionaires **enforcing the rules** rather than the legislators doing their job if they feel something is amiss?
3312,Because those are the terms of service and Enforcing the Rules is what they should do when people violate them.
3313,"Again Twitter is not policing anything, they are removing Misinformation and Propaganda that is being spread on Twitter and other social media platforms."
3314,This is in direct response to the the people who are abusing the platform to sow division and influence the political landscape of your country.
3315,The real question should be what are your elected officials doing to stop the spread of foreign influence on American Citizens via these Social Media Platforms?
3316,The very fact you are focused on Twitter here is the very reason they need to curtail the spread of Propaganda and Misinformation.
3317,I... wouldn’t say they have access to food much less cheap (cheap to us but not to them) or fresh.
3318,They don’t have access to food.
3319,That’s the point.
3320,If you told that to the mother in India living with her kids playing in the sewage water that runs in the streets where they live they laugh their heads off and ask you where this Heaven you speak of is.
3321,Same for the ppl living in rural China where farmers have been left behind in the push to modernize.
3322,Their produce quota is high and they aren’t exactly eating well.
3323,i thought it was more of a butter
3324,"If we have herd immunity by the fall, why would it not be deemed safe for large indoor crowds?"
3325,[removed]
3326,So how much longer are the public health experts going to pretend like fully vaccinated people still can’t hug or hang out with other people without masks?
3327,People are losing their teeth from the vaccine here.

3358,i have a 15 month old and i agree it’s better to be cautious of course and put our children’s safety first.
3359,"but we also have to realize that there are always going to be risks out there, and there are many things we do that are probably more risky than them catching covid."
3360,"of course be careful, but our children need to socialize and experience the world too."
3361,I'd imagine there are quite a few with my mindset also.
3362,I'm not opposed to getting the vaccine and should be getting the call to get mine in the next couple of weeks due to being a gov't employee and the rollout plans here.
3363,"However, being early/mid-30s, healthy, and having already had covid, I'm planning to wait till near the back of the line (once it's open to the public for anyone to take) so other people who want the vaccine and haven't had covid can get it since I already have some immunity."
3364,The decision may bite me in the ass but I doubt it.
3365,"I have no issues wearing masks, I actually kind of like walking about somewhat unanimous."
3366,My only issue is how badly they fog up my glasses!
3367,"It's a small price to pay to curb the spread of a deadly disease, so I suck it up and deal with it."
3368,"Since I’m 22 and gonna be one of the last in line for this shot, I’m personally tuning out all news of this till Mid-May, when it’s reportedly gonna be available to the general population."
3369,i’m quite curious what virus was that?
3370,"https://www.fda.gov/media/144434/download

Check out the end of page 27, chart on 28."
3371,"&gt;Based on the cumulative incidence curve for cases in the mITT efficacy population after randomization (same as date of dose 1), COVID-19 cases appear to have occurred similarly at low rates for both the mRNA-1273 and placebo groups until around Day 14 after dose 1

Pretty much some point around day 14 the curves between vaccinated and non vaccinated start to grow apart"
3372,"I have made imaginary vacation plans to travel to Japan in October, Australia in January and Las Vegas in April."
3373,A big part of me believes none of these are realistic.
3374,News like this moves me a bit closer to believing it
3375,I think it’s driven at least to a degree by selfishness.
3376,There are plenty of Americans that can comfortably work from home for the next 2-4 months waiting for 2 doses.
3377,The potential extra X deaths and hospitalizations don’t mean as much to them as the minuscule increased chance of a vaccine resistant variant which would set them back possibly another year.
3378,It would be interesting to see what the opinions of people who can’t reasonably social distance for the next two month compares to the WFH crowd.
3379,What you eat impacts your *desire*.
3380,Your hands and your brain control your intake.
3381,The way you're wording this is what's confusing people with making them down vote you.
3382,"Yes, eating 400 calories worth of chips is not going to sustain you as long as 400 calories of almonds."
3383,Carbohydrates burn faster than fats and proteins.
3384,"But take a step back, and that's where the current conversation is."
3385,"You have to teach people how calories work, and the give or take situation of eating and burning."
3386,One needs to have a fundamental understanding of what calories are and how they work before you get to perfecting sources.
3387,You have a higher risk of having children with birth defects or developmental disorders over the age of 35.
3388,"But whatever, it can be helped to lower risk."
3389,"I myself was born to old parents, probably older than anyone here."
3390,I get what you're saying.
3391,I'm glad I'm not in this situation.
3392,But they won't necessarily have to wear masks.
3393,Not all vaccines work that way.
3394,Examples: The common cold and the flu.
3395," Interesting, got any sources on that?"
3396,"I understand that MOST transmission happens in homes with visitors and family members, but slowing the less common spread is also important."
3397,Someone has to take that virus back home with them for it to spread there.
3398,Also saying that the article was only on influenza is misleading.
3399,"There are entire sections of the study about ecological studies comparing the rate of spread in countries and areas with and without mask mandates, statistical modelling of mask use, laboratory studies of the effectiveness of masks both for source control and personal protection, and direct epidemiological evidence that they work SPECIFICALLY FOR SARS-CoV-2."
3400,That is the information you asked for and it was in the article you dismissed.
3401,"Florida is in the middle of the pack as well, without restrictions."
3402,That's my point.
3403,What are some good things that have happened or you have learned within the past year because of the pandemic/masks/staying home?
3404,1.
3405,"Grew my hair out during stay at home orders and really like it now 
2."
3406,"Wearing masks actually makes walking in the cold a little easier since your face is covered with something
3."
3407,I was able to avoid this annoying kid from my high school because he didn’t recognize me with long hair + a mask.
3408,4.
3409,"Lots of time to reflect and learn about myself 
5."
3410,Had time to watch great shows such as Mad Men and Avatar the last Airbender as well as play some great games like Spiderman and LA Noire
3411, If most of the people around you do have a vaccine you should be relatively safe.
3412,It’s why people with weak immune systems that cannot actually take vaccines are not getting so many diseases.
3413,my birthday is the 15th so that's what i consider the beginning of the pandemic ( for me ) and I already don't go to work and just drink all day on that day.
3414,i think for many business sectors and even whole regions of the country life will be changed.
3415,Even with a vaccine rollout there's going to be a huge hesitancy to return to pre-pandemic social patterns.
3416,The Bay area/SV is the prime example.
3417,"Even compared to LA down south, SF is a ghost town."
3418,"It's so tech/IT-driven that work from home can be sustained indefinitely without affecting productivity &amp; growth, at least in the short term."
3419,I bet that it's similar with other knowledge-dominated R&amp;D hubs across the US.
3420,"100 percent agree 
I don't care where they go as long as they're getting used"
3421,"&gt;A spokesman added that member states were free to find additional vaccines as long as they did not seek to negotiate side deals with the EU’s main suppliers, namely AstraZeneca, Moderna and Pfizer."
3422,"&gt;  
&gt;He said: “The point is that none of them has signalled in any way that they want to receive less doses based on our vaccination strategy."
3423,So if an EU country did opt out.
3424,"They would be banned from buying AstraZeneca, Moderna &amp; Pfizer."
3425,"Well that explains why they haven't: ""Signalled in any way that they want to receive less doses based on the EU vaccination strategy."""
3426,Except in fucking holland where we are vaccinating with the tempo of a pregnant snail.
3427,"I would ask this on the science sub Covid19, but I'm banned."
3428,"Can someone help me understand ""spreading covid 19"" vs ""spreading the virus""?"
3429,"From the CDC website:

*Experts continue to conduct more studies about the effect of COVID-19 vaccination on severity of illness from COVID-19, as well as its ability to keep people from spreading the virus that causes COVID-19."
3430,"*

What does ""spreading the virus"" look like?"
3431,"The vaccinated person is immune enough to not get sick, but the virus still takes hold in them?"
3432,"The reason I ask is how do we ever convince people who are afraid of long covid that the vaccine ""works""?"
3433,"I know I've read here before ""covid is the disease, it means you have symptoms, if you don't have symptoms you don't have covid""."
3434,But this spreading the virus language is hard for me to understand re how it affects a vaccinated person's life right now.
3435,Thanks!
3436,Probably check residence.
3437,Though some may have a cabin in the county to use as an address.
3438,We all know who his main opponent will be unfortunately...
3439,"Well, the 5G conspiracy last year led to multiple attacks of 5G towers and equipment."
3440,You can imagine this real-world consequence didn't set well with authorities.
3441,"Additionally, it didn't sit well with tech companies like Twitter, whose business benefits from 5G adoption."
3442,Cracking down on these comments is as much about business as it is about stopping misinformation.
3443,Good summary of it here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2rRIqrWuYy4&amp;t=7m49s
3444,Wish I could award this :D
3445,Ever stop to think that there are those of us who *don't* want to show our faces?
3446,"Because of social anxiety agoraphobia, being judged because of how you look, or because of asthma, allergies, and other respiratory diseases."
3447,"If you don't to wear a mask thats fine and dandy for you, but why would you want to impose that choice on someone else who might need it for any variety of reasons?"
3448,"Cool, if you’re at risk quarantine YOURSELF until you can get a vaccine."
3449,Obvious troll is obvious.
3450,Oh I thought we were talking about the 1 week snap lockdowns.
3451,The Big Ten will probably allow 10% capacity this year.
3452,"""authoritarianism""... LOL"
3453,Made me realize that I rarely see something pop up in /r/Ebola these days
3454,Only in a minority of cases.
3455,Hardly more dangerous than other things we allow and accept in society whilst being aware of the risks.
3456,"We allow smoking even though we know that's dangerous, I believe we should allow freedom to meet for people despite the fringe risks of serious illness in young healthy people (which is still very rare)."
3457,"(After the risk groups have been vaccinated of course, since those are who we are REALLY protecting after all)"
3458,"1/4 of Americans probably won't take the vaccine, so it balances out."
3459,The increase in symptoms the second time could also mean your body was weak after fighting 1st infection.
3460,Do what ?
3461,These baby restrictions were never really restrictions anyways.
3462,I believe there is something called Mastadon that works ok!

3466,"This doesn't seem like an even ""probably"" case of re-infection."
3467,"No symptoms and sero-negative after the ""first"" infection would seem far more likely to be a false positive the first time."
3468,My parents were young adults in the 80s and have talked about how that's when they remembered everyone started getting fat.
3469,"In my own personal experience, I developed an autoimmune disorder at 17 which rendered me no longer able to eat fast food, most kinds of junk food, etc."
3470,All of my meals have to be made at home.
3471,"That played a huge role in making my weight drop like a rock, and I was short and skinny beforehand."
3472,"I'm 5'2, was about 108 lbs, now I'm 98 on my good days."
3473,Being cut off completely from the fast food world makes me think of Supersize Me.
3474,That documentary is just as relevant now as it was 20 years ago.
3475,"""Started rewatching the pandemi...is THIS the moment where it became a problem?"""
3476,"&gt; I swear some people cope with their anxiety by trying to give it to others

That kind of makes sense, in a weird way."
3477,Irrational anxiety doesn't feel as irrational if everyone else is experiencing it too.
3478,"You aren't the weird one for panicking in your house for months, doing a full decontamination ritual after grocery shopping, if everyone is doing the same thing."
3479,Where the hell are you?
3480,"I don’t think it’s relevant yet, because you wouldn’t find any medical professionals who would be willing to modify the doses."
3481,Your sex and age also play a part in how much immunity you develop.
3482,Whether it would be worthwhile to lose weight in order to protect your health more I also couldn’t answer because that’s a complicated question with a lot of interacting elements.
3483,"In this particular study, they didn’t ask whether the participants did strength training or aerobic exercise."
3484,[The antibody titre was found to be higher in young and female participants.
3485,A strong correlation of BMI classes with antibody titres was noticed: humoral response was more efficient in the group with under- and normal-weight vs the group with pre- and obesity participants (p&lt;0.0001 at T1).
3486,"These findings imply that females, lean and young people have an increased capacity to mount humoral immune responses compared to males, overweight and the older population."
3487,"Although further studies are needed, this data may have important implications for the development of vaccination strategies for COVID-19, particularly in obese people."

3489,Did you take into account 1/4 of Americans already contracted the virus?
3490,If not then your guesstimate is misleading.
3491,Oh yeah I meant in response to the 8 week interval.
3492,"I know that a bunch of people that study prime and boost typically boost at 8 weeks anyway, but not sure how that translates to human models etc."
3493,Totally agree that there is a response from first dose — but we also don’t know if that’s purely IgM.
3494,"Definitely confers some immunity, and enough to be hopeful about for sure."
3495,"Just saying that if we don’t have 8 week boost studies, would be concerned if they started implementing it."
3496,But I also realize desperate times...
3497,"Sure won't, but thanks for making an unfounded assumption about my perspective."
3498,I'm a professional musician so my livelihood depends on people being able to congregate for performances.
3499,"I'd very much like that to happen before my unemployment runs out so I can pay my bills, but I also don't want people to get sick and die unnecessarily."
3500,We're so close to the finish line; there's no reason to trip while we cross it.
3501,By June the US will be exporting shit tons of vaccines to many countries including Mexico and Canada.
3502,The US has not even finished vaccinating its 1a group yet (over 50 million citizens) and yall are mad we aren't exporting?
3503,Were gonna take care of you fam just chill.
3504,We have nearly 25% of the covid deathsworldwide because of the idiotic previous administration and their adherents.
3505,&gt; Are you a criminal for not wearing a mask?
3506,"If a law is passed stating you have to wear a mask, and you don't, then you're breaking the law."
3507,"If you break the law, by definition, you're a criminal."
3508,Maintaining a healthy lifestyle is managing your health no?
3509,Ppl predisposed to T2 ( my family is on my dad’s side) don’t develop diabetes by being healthy in the most normal way.
3510,There aren’t even any extra steps.
3511,Just be healthy.
3512,"Very, very worrying, but nothing new."
3513,America is owned by its corporations
3514,"Interesting how the Astra-Zeneca vaccin, that suffers from such a bad image, is now referred to as ""Oxford-AstraZeneca"""
3515,"We will, before too long."
3516,Most people still aren't vaccinated at this point.
3517,Interesting.
3518,Just a sore arm for me from the first shot.
3519,Did you have covid previously?
3520,If that's going to happen it's going to happen regardless in one of the high population countries where coronavirus is being allowed to spread.
3521,Having to wear a mask is hardly throwing everything that makes life worth living into the trash.
3522,First FDA trial to involve nasal administration!
3523,Talk about a game changer.
3524,So post offices still
3525,Thank you for the clarification!
3526,"And the people of Texas have the capability to either mask on their own, recall him, or pressure their representatives."
3527,Health restrictions are political decisions.
3528,Have been since last March.
3529,It is simply going to become more apparent now.
3530,"If they get everyone an n95 mask before they get the majority of the population vaccinated, you might have a point."
3531,I assume everyone in Texas doesn't have one.
3532,"I was referring to platforms and justifications offered last year, that it will go away by summer."
3533,"As I said, it's a variation of it."
3534,Kinda transparent too.
3535,Head to South Carolina or North Florida if you can.

3634,So as Reddit LOVES to point out mask usage really took off in SE Asia after SARS in 2003 and just stuck around especially with pollution fears and now facial recognition.
3635,Nope.
3636,Mask usage increase did jack shit.
3637,Oh and here is my favorite.

3643,Mask usage is extremely rare.
3644,So SURELY since those nations aren't wearing masks influenza is not been stopped?

3652,Vaccine evading mutations will only develop if we don’t reduce the risk of having recently vaccinated people get infected.
3653,Texas has entered the Chat
3654,We've lasted a year without an clear end goal in sight.
3655,If we run into problems with variants thwarting vaccines its gonna be a challenge.
3656,Hard to say what to do in that scenario without knowing the scope of the problem.
3657,"So throw that in the ""cross that bridge if we get to it pile""

Ruling that out..."
3658,I think most people can hold on for a couple more months.
3659,Especially as pretty soon we can start slowly reopening stuff and watching what that does to the numbers.
3660,"Then, as more people get vaccinated we can keep increasing what we reopen."
3661,"It doesn't, and shouldn't, have to be a simple ""flip the switch"" moment but should be a carefully controlled ""open it a bit, see what happens, make sure the numbers are still okay, repeat"" process

Hopefully by the July/August timeframe we'll have almost everyone vaccinated and pretty much everything reopen except maybe stuff like packed concert venues."
3662,"And even that, end of summer seems like a reasonable timeline where we can even safely consider reopening those too."
3663,"&gt;AUSTIN, Texas (AP) — Texas is lifting its mask mandate, Gov."
3664,"Greg Abbott said Tuesday, making it the largest state to end an order intended to prevent the spread of the coronavirus that has killed more than 42,000 Texans."
3665,"&gt;The Republican governor has faced sharp criticism from his party over the mandate, which was imposed eight months ago, as well as other COVID-19 restrictions on businesses that Texas will also scuttle starting next week."
3666,"The mask order was only ever lightly enforced, even during the worst outbreaks of the pandemic."
3667,"&gt;The repealed rules include doing away with limits on the number of diners or customers allowed indoors, said Abbott, who made the announcement at a restaurant in Lubbock."
3668,"He said the new rules would take effect March 10, although leaders in Houston and other big Texas cities were already reacting with alarm."
3669,"&gt;“Removing statewide mandates does not end personal responsibility,” said Abbott, speaking from the crowded dining room where many of those surrounding him were not wearing masks."
3670,"&gt;“It’s just that now state mandates are no longer needed,” he said."
3671,"&gt;The decision comes as governors across the U.S. have been easing coronavirus restrictions, despite warnings from health experts that the pandemic is far from over."
3672,"Like the rest of the country, Texas has seen the number of cases and deaths plunge."
3673,"Hospitalizations are at the lowest levels since October, and the seven-day rolling average of positive tests has dropped to about 7,600 cases, down from more than 10,000 in mid-February."
3674,&gt;Only California and New York have reported more COVID-19 deaths than Texas.
3675,"Cool, they're trespassing."
3676,"just realize though that it's a POLITICAL decision, and these local &amp; regional leaders are staking out positions on easing to appease certain vocal factions."

Even if there is no mutation, it is easy to take care of 100 less risky patient instead of 100k less risky patient."

3706,"Ridge girl, it hasn’t even been the one year ani of 15 days to stop the spread."
3707,How could it be a year and a half of schooling lost?
3708,I’m all for kids going back to school.
3709,The science backs me up.
3710,It’s completely safe.
3711,You’re the one that wants to keep kids locked up.
3712,I wear a mask.
3713,I distance from strangers.
3714,I go to bars that are spaced.
3715,I’ve never tested positive for covid.
3716,But fuck no Im not spending a year in my house watching Netflix.
3717,Call me whatever you want.
3718,"the whole ""outdoor gatherings are banned"" that we saw in California better be identified as a bad restriction that shouldn't be implemented in the future."
3719,But when has a premature opening ever worked out with covid?
3720,What's the definition of insanity - *Doing the same thing and expecting a different result* ?
3721,This is much more a result of widespread misinformation than it is rampant individualism.
3722,"Yeah man, they totally die from the flu because they wear masks, not because they’re a country full of old people."
3723,"Why don’t we use actual stats that make sense, like out of 100k people, how many die from the flu a year?"
3724,"Japan is ranked 87.

https://championtraveler.com/news/the-us-flu-season-is-bad-this-year-but-influenza-is-still-way-more-deadly-around-the-world/"
3725,1 year in and we STILL need to explain to you people how masks work?
3726,RemindMe!
3727,2 months
3728,Got some real “mission accomplished” vibes.
3729,"Congrats, Texans!"
3730,Hope my state gets there someday.
3731,"Yay, we'll add back in all the carbon we didn't emit from people flying around for no reason!"
3732,My friend was just in Naples and said everything was open and there were no mask mandates.
3733,He went out barhopping and said it was like Covid didn't exist.
3734,This isn't akin to betting it all on black.
3735,We have been constantly monitoring cases/hospitalizations/deaths and the decision was made based on those numbers.
3736,"I'm guessing it was decided that the risk of hospitals being overrun was minimal and, therefore, it was time to open up."
3737,I agree with that decision.
3738,"Also, I'm pretty sure the governor said they would re-evaluate if things got out of control."
3739,I couldn't remember exactly what he said about that.
3740,"I wasn't quite paying attention to that part, since I felt like that won't happen."
3741,I’ve come across an unsettling amount of people who do not want to get vaccinated.
3742,I hope they change their minds soon
3743,Wtf are you talking about?
3744,"Are you saying ""why dont scientists communicate the effectiveness of vaccines?"""
3745,I thought thats what they were saying this whole time.
3746,A state in the top 3 for most variants relaxes restrictions?
3747,What could go wrong.
3748,"Yeah, shame on the FDA for using a fact and research-based approach when they could just crossed their fingers and gone wild!"
3749,I think most of the batshit insane people on this sub left a couple months ago when good news started getting posted.
3750,Fauci never actually said that though.
3751,Everyone was trashing Flordia so hard during this whole pandemic but their numbers compared to a lot of states are not bad at all despite having an old population and limited restrictions.
3752,Is it time to start admitting they may have handled this right?
3753,Texas is officially strongly recommending masks and social distancing even after this Executive Order goes into effect.
3754,"If a variant emerges that resists vaccines, widespread restrictions will probably end in early to mid 2022."
3755,We’re potentially doubling the length of the pandemic at this point because some of us can’t wait until summer to roll back restrictions
3756,This sub is too young to get its vaccine.
3757,Bound to happen
3758,"Twitter has always had its nutjobs wherever you look, pre and post-Covid."
3759,"I know there are a handful of high quality trackers for how fast the vaccine is going out, how many cases and deaths there are, and so on- But has anyone made a tracker for where the restrictions have been lifted at the state level?"
3760,"I know that it would be difficult to do it by the town level or to track if businesses are still enforcing their own public health measures, but it would be interesting to see where the restrictions have been lifted and to watch it grow over time."
3761,"Off the top of my head, I believe Florida, Iowa, Texas, Mississippi, Montana ^(I think?)"
3762,"and a few other states have lifted their mask mandates, and it's a number I absolutely expect to see grow as we approach a majority initiating vaccination on a national level."
3763,If anyone has access to a regularly updated map I'd be excited to save it.
3764,"that's true, if a variant can cause the vaccine to be ineffective, then there is no beating this..because by the time the another vaccine comes out for the variant, a new variant will appear..and so on."
3765,The only way to beat this is if everyone stays inside for another year...fuck that.
3766,"If we get it, we get it at this point."
3767,Same with Virginia (although smoker isn’t an eligibility point here... yet)
3768,"Oh, so you agree that not all states are the same and that restrictions should be made with locality and socioeconomics in mind?"
3769,Except anyone who’s said that vaccines will prevent spread is being called a conspiracy theorist
3770,No mention of a mandatory quarantine
3771,Hopeful public health scientist actually study if restrictions have any effect and if so which ones and how much.
3772,"This post appears to be about vaccines, please see [our FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/wiki/faq#wiki_where_can_i_find_information_about_the_mechanism_and_progress_of_vaccines.3F) for answers to frequently asked questions regarding the COVID-19 vaccines."

3776,*
3777,I'm in california and I personally think the state's level of strictness has led to things being worse.
3778,Everything was shut down and people got annoyed so they started having gatherings at their houses.
3779,I haven't been to a bar or restaurant in a year but I know tons of people who are having gatherings/parties/people over.
3780,"I mean, that was the point"
3781,"Texas: “Here, hold my mask and watch this!”"
3782,Everyone who wants a vaccine will have one by April.
3783,"This won't be a huge mistake, but I guess we will see."
3784,So Texas has determined the science and data are telling them to open.
3785,I don’t see the issue
3786,Glad I can find people in the weeds of Doom and Gloom to agree with
3787,It's a mistake not to vaccinate everyone.
3788,The long term health consequences will be extreme.
3789,"Young people do not die often of Coronavirus, but they do linger in the hospital for months and develop long term health problems because their body can take more punishment than an older person with preexisting conditions."
3790,It didn’t occur to me that post offices count as federal property.
3791,"At my local post office, half the employees don’t wear a mask at all, most of the rest wear them below the nose."
3792,Nearly no one going in ever wears one that I’ve seen.
3793,[removed]
3794,No
3795,Because...math.
3796,Woot!
3797,Lezgo!
3798,ITT: Stupid people.
3799,Mississippi still has Covid restrictions.
3800,The mask mandate is optional.
3801,Texas on the other hand removed everything
3802,Yes over a year ago.
3803,I'm sure you've noticed things have changed quite a bit since then.
3804,"Yo, need to close the borders...OUT of Texas."
3805,"I knew we are all gonna be screwed this summer by going everyone going wild and free, but Jesus."
3806,Big if true
3807,"I don't mean to be disrespectful, but the experts and so don't seem to agree with this position."
3808,"Lots of talk about plateau regarding numbers, which means we've hit our post holiday travel baseline, and those numbers are showing growth."
3809,Not the end.
3810,That and my understanding is it has something about evolution and mutations.
3811,"I'm fairly sure we know that's happening, since it's everywhere now."
3812,How do you plan to stop those in your plan?
3813,I get what you’re going for but the only way you can require it is by law or under an emergency order.
3814,Flu season doesn’t qualify as an emergency and there is no way anybody is codifying masking.
3815,None.
3816,"If the state government won’t and can’t mandate it, it’s not like cities and Walmart are going to stick their necks out."
3817,I love this.
3818,The White House hopefully just gave Governors a target for easing all restrictions: June 1st.
3819,Can you give me a quick summary on the nursing home stuff?
3820,I would google but I never know if the article I click on is spinning it.

3829,"This is the first season I wasn't stricken with a cold or flu, so I might mask up during the autumn/ winter from here on out."
3830,But the same amount of people died in lockdown states too
3831,Just got back from Hawaii.
3832,Covid is barely there.
3833,Go there.
3834,Thank me later.
3835,(I ate dinner in a restaurant without a mask on and it was safe and normal and awesome).

3839,"This will be answered in blood like the safety book says, it is written in blood."
3840,Those who refuse to follow safety measures end up causing needless deaths.
3841,Unfortunately the pandemic restrictions are a form of managerial control.
3842,"""Don't look into the tip of a pencil while walking"" it's a very strong suggestion, but won't prevent some from doing it."
3843,LETS GO TEXAS !!
3844,Thats how you take a stand
3845,The thing is now we have something that's supposed to be the difference maker in the vaccines.
3846,"If after we roll those out we lift restrictions and curfews and we STILL go up, then the danger is going to be people wonder what the point of getting the vaccine is."
3847,We already have health officials touting all these variants that they say we can't do anything about them getting here.
3848,How many more mixed messaging are we going to have from the talking heads before the general public is fed up with being confused with it all.
3849,That and at some point we have to start considering the opening back up of society.
3850,"If not now, when?"
3851,"They can always reinstate the mandates if things go south, but we should be hoping for the best here, and at least try to get things back to normal."
3852,And hospitals have stayed under capacity now correct?
3853,So by that logic it’s time to start easing restrictions
3854,I cannot come to this sub anymore for such information.

3864,"I predict By April 1 vaccine appointments will be available to most people, and by May we will already be seeing low demand due to the fact that the people who want a vaccine will have already been vaccinated!"
3865,Every adult would be 250m.

3867,"Most likely if you fight hard for a vaccine youll get it well before May, early April maybe for general population."

3894,"Well, now that Texas removed it, wait until your governor follows (I hope mine doesn't)."
3895,I think everyone has a “screw it” date in their mind.
3896,Why does that seem unlikely?
3897,If a bunch of people start crowding into bars without masks the hospitals will absolutely be overrun.
3898,"Basically we are seeing the end of the xmas surge, and declaring victory against all logic, reason, and science."
3899,Being at Pre-November levels is nothing to brag about.
3900,I think it is a huge mistake.
3901,I have not flown to Texas to see my family in over a year.
3902,"We were hoping that with some people vaccinated it might be safe to travel there this summer still taking precautions, but now this?"
3903,"I guess I will have to watch and see what happens, but it is throwing a wrench in my plans again for no reason."
3904,There is absolutely NO reason why we can’t be pretty much back to normal by fall.
3905,None.
3906,I know this article has been out for less than an hour but I feel like this is absolutely huge news (in a good way)
3907,It'll be interesting to see what the timeline looks like in terms of getting shots in people's arms.
3908,"If we have the supply by end of may, can do a mass vaccination push in the first part of June then yeah... can actually fully reopen stuff in July

3938,"If there are medical implications of this illness, we need to know this for better treatment."

3940,"If the curve unflattens (which it won't), the governor can re-evaluate restrictions, just like many states and countries have been doing this past year."
3941,"Because without a control group, your data is functionally useless."
3942,"If you vaccinate a group of similar people and only 0.1% of them contract the illness, that's great, but you have no way of knowing whether that's a matter of not coming into contact with the virus or because the vaccine was effective."
3943,"If you have a control group, and 10% of them contract the illness, while your vaccine group results in 0.1% contraction, now you've shown quantifiable reduction of transmission."
3944,"That said, there's a lot of ethical considerations happening that don't generally apply to a 'normal' medical trial, from what I understand."
3945,"For example, if I am presented with the opportunity to receive a vaccine, have a medical emergency, or become pregnant, I can call them and they will immediately unblind me and tell me whether or not I'm vaccinated."
3946,"Some of the phase 2 trials have, at the end of their periods, informed recipients that they received the vaccine and administered a real vaccine to the placebo group at the end of the study."
3947,"&amp;#x200B;

If you want to know more about it, one of my favorite comedy podcasts - which normally covers historical medical oddities - [did an episode where the doctor talks about the vaccine in general and her experience in a trial](https://maximumfun.org/episodes/sawbones/covid-vaccine-questions-and-answers/)."
3948,The plot thickens...
3949,Health care workers are all vaccinated at this point.

3952,"Personally, I am never visiting a brick and mortar store ever again, and I'm sure there are many people who feel the same way."
3953,I won't be surprised.
3954,"A lot of companies have been falling back on ""In accordance with the government mandate...""."
3955,"Now that that will be gone, companies have to defend mask usage as a company choice instead of something they are being made to do."
3956,You're going to see a lot of companies do away with mandates simply because they don't want to deal with the assholes.
3957,I remember when Desantis banned people from NYC
3958,We are almost there.
3959,This summer is going to be spectacular.
3960,Being able to go maskless for July on would be amazing.

4029,Wearing masks in public was the norm for Japan way before the thought of a global pandemic was on the anyone's mind.

4051,"It has drastically affected the world economy, logistics, pollution, animal migrations, global mental health, it's just an insane experiment that reveals SO MUCH into how the world currently works, it's an amazing petri dish - again, like those in WW2, it supremely sucks for those who had to live through it but what we learned, and will continue to learn far into the future, is really interesting."

4170,Actually this area of the state seems really variable by town.
4171,My immediate town and the neighboring city as a whole has been very good about masks and the like whereas a neighboring one I was in just the other day was the first place I'd been in since this all started where absolutely noone was wearing masks or attempting any sort of social distancing.

4280,The problem has been until there is a real scientific study the responsible thing to do is assume it does not stop vaccinated individuals from spreading.

4333,"Once teachers and other school staff are vaccinated, once parents are vaccinated, grandparents, day care workers, etc, the chance of a kid contracting COVID reduces to the point it's not worth worrying about unless your child is immunocompromised."
4334,Even people with immunocompromised children will be able to rest easier once vaccination rates are high.

4353,Actually mRNA vaccine manufacturing will be faster and easier than traditional vaccines in the future.
4354,The reason it has been slow this time is because it’s a completely new manufacturing process and production facilities have to be changed to adapt to that.

# [https://www.reuters.com/article/health-canada-astrazeneca-idUSL2N2KZ2JB](https://www.reuters.com/article/health-canada-astrazeneca-idUSL2N2KZ2JB)

 Canada’s National Advisory Committee on Immunization released new guidelines on Monday that advise against vaccinating people who are 65 years and older with AstraZeneca’s COVID-19 vaccine, citing lack of information about efficacy in that age group."

4417,Many are saying that there will be permanent changes to society.
4418,There will always be another goalpost and this will only end when the people say enough.
4419,&gt;You just compared COVID to the flu.
4420,You essentially stated wearing masks for COVID would be similar to wearing masks for the flu.
4421,COVID is not the flu.
4422,Masks don't work the same nor is the mortality level even close.
4423,..and you compared COVID to drunk driving.
4424,"&gt;If the numbers showed it could save anywhere near the levels of people saved by wearing them for COVID, we probably should."
4425,"Hell, as a society we should be promoting mask wearing if you are sick during flu season."
4426,It is common many other places.
4427,"&gt;  
&gt;Yet the main difference with the flu is we have vaccinations readily available to all, and masks have not seemed as effective for the flu."
4428,"Right now no state has vaccinations readily available to all, and masks have shown to be way more effective for COVID."
4429,On top of all of there the CDC is not recommending any of these actions.
4430,Based on any scientific knowledge combined with any sort of common sense restrictions should not be fully lifted right now.
4431,Flu vaccines are only [40%-60% effective](https://www.cdc.gov/flu/vaccines-work/vaccineeffect.htm).
4432,Why does it need to save a certain number of lives before you support a mask mandate?
4433,Heaven forbid you wear a piece of cloth over you mouth and nose for a few more months.
4434,"Best case, more people die than would have died."
4435,"Worst case, vaccination rates don't keep up with the mutations of the virus and this becomes a neverending cycle that kills one out of every 700 (current total in texas is 1:650) residents every year."
4436,"For a reference point, that's 36x more people than are killed in drunk driving accidents."
4437,"Seriously, the only way you can possibly think this is a good idea is if you're absolutely terrible at basic math."
4438,"If there is anything the reduction in flu cases in 2020 has shown us, people need to stay the hell home whenever they have symptoms."
4439,&gt;I agree with you.
4440,I had to quit my gym over it.
4441,"I don’t know why “fitness culture” has decided contracting the virus is a smart, healthy choice, but it has."
4442,"Unfortunately, that’s the way it is in Florida."
4443,"🤷‍♀️ 

I doubt they think contracting it is a ""healthy choice"" but rather they see they have a 99.8% chance of survival, are probably relatively healthy (going to the gym) and deem the risk acceptable because they get more value and release from a workout."
4444,Everyone has different risk tolerances.
4445,Personally I feel like the people with less tolerance should just wait for the vaccine and let the young folks get back to living

4453,&gt;	I’m not ignoring the science.
4454,"Science says children can die from Covid, 

Why do you mean science says that?"
4455,&gt;and MIS-C can have long term effects that we don’t yet fully know because it hasn’t actually been all that long.
4456,Could you please provide the data your are referring to?
4457,I’ve asked this already and yet you’ve failed to do so.
4458,"&gt;	I didn’t say they were, so I am glad we can agree?"
4459,"So, why are you arguing as though the data regarding deaths/cases for ppl under 20 was incorrect?"
4460,"&gt;	I’m on mobile and formatting is already annoying, 

So, you actually don’t have the data to support what you’re arguing."
4461,I’m on mobile rom and already posted the data.
4462,&gt;so I’m not going to sort through statistics for you.
4463,"So, you don’t have it."
4464,"Got it

&gt;I welcome you to do some fairly easy google searches to find the CDC information on this (or plenty of other health publications) if your legitimately interested."
4465,"So, you can’t actually provide the data to support your argument and now demanding I do it for you?"
4466,"&gt;	You actually haven’t provided data in this comment chain 

I provided two links detailing the rates children contract, symptoms and deaths of covid and even one comparing that to the same with the flu."
4467,Please take a moment to look at them.
4468,"&gt;Regardless, I’m not claiming any data is wrong, 

What about the data then I provided are you disputing?"
4469,"&gt;I am claiming that you, as the person in this chain that has said nothing other then children don’t die is wrong."
4470,They’re aren’t dying according to the data I provided.
4471,Please take a moment to review that data so you have a clue what’s the context is.
4472,You obviously haven’t!
4473,&gt;Because factually whether an “anomaly” or not they can and have.
4474,"Again, take a moment to read the data provided so you understand the discussion going on here."
4475,&gt;	Uhhh what?
4476,When did I even attempt to create disinformation?
4477,I provided data as to covid cases and death rate of children.
4478,I’d yore claiming any of that is wrong please support that accusation.
4479,If you can’t you’re doing nothing but spreading disinformation.
4480,&gt;Nothing I said was factually incorrect.
4481,Are you still disputing the data I provided?
4482,"&gt;And as for ""an attempt to sensationalize this topic"", you started this entire conversation."
4483,Why am I sensationalizing buy providing data of covid cases and death of children?
4484,"&gt;I made a general comment (to a different user) that long term issues are possible, 

Could you provide what science you’re referring to?"
4485,"&gt;because they are, and that as such like said user despite being likely to survive still didn't want to contract it."
4486,"Again, can you substantiate what you’re arguing?"
4487,What are you talking about?
4488,&gt;	My end goal here was to agree with a general comment by another user that you tried to turn into some kind of weird pissing match with me.
4489,Why are you trying to discredit the data I’ve provided regarding children catching covid?
4490,&gt;Literally nothing about policy or moving forward was discussed between me and that user or even you and me prior to our interaction.
4491,"So, you’re just fear mongering then since you for whatever reason have a problem with the data I provided showing children under 20 aren’t dying from
Covid?"
4492,&gt;	I’m not pushing fear of any kind.
4493,Denying the science and data that is known?
4494,Why?
4495,"&gt;I’m not pushing anything, actually I didn’t even reply to you in this chain to begin with I replied to someone else and you took it upon yourself to tell me “It’s like ppl are outright ignore data and science to push unsubstantiated fear mongering”."
4496,Why are you ignoring the science?
4497,Is there a goal to come on here and act like children under 20 are dying at rates adults are to covid?
4498,"&gt;Perhaps you should look back up through this chain and you will see I was advocating for the same thing the person above me was, not catching covid because despite being in an age group likely to survive I still don’t want it in my system as it can cause long-term issues."
4499,So why are you trying to deligitimize the science and data that exist regarding children under 20?
4500,&gt;	haven’t said anything that isn’t searchable and relatively easy to find.
4501,"So, why can’t you provide anything to support what you’re arguing here?"
4502,&gt;You can verify in a quick search that MIS-C can have long-term effects and that people under 20 die from covid.
4503,"So, you don’t actually have the data and can’t speak intelligently on the topic?"
4504,"&gt;Everything I have said came from CDC, Yale Medicine, WHO, the Mayo clinic and probably a couple others I have forgotten."
4505,Can you provide it then so we can discuss it?
4506,"&gt;You’re the one here who is trying to say people under 20 don’t die (false) 

What is false about the data I provided?"
4507,Please explain!!
4508,&gt;and have no lasting effects (also false in the current “long term” that we are).
4509,I didn’t say that.
4510,"I asked you to provide details as to what you’re claiming I’m regards to
Long term effects on children and you haven’t."
4511,Why?
4512,"&gt;	Idon’t disagree that the number of dead or long term illness is smaller in the younger age group, 

Drastically less as the data I provided shows."
4513,&gt;	I honestly don’t understand how we got to this point with you bringing up stuff that was never mentioned from a general comment I made to someone else.
4514,"You calling into question the data I provided regarding covid for children under 20

&gt;If you’re looking for a debate with someone I don’t have the time or energy for it so you might want to try and find it somewhere else."
4515,Hope you have a wonderful day.
4516,"Seriously, don’t try to discredit actual science especially if you’re unable to provide any of your own to support anything you’re arguing."
4517,You could be forgiven for thinking so.
4518,We've been *de facto* 100% open with no mask order since August or so of last year.
4519,This just makes it embarrassingly official and gives an extra round of ammo to his anti-masker base.

4532,Vaccines will still protect against this variant
4533,I wonder when we will hit the inflection point between supply and demand where the problem will start to be convincing the unvaccinated to go and get their shot.
4534,Is there a name for the moment when this occurs?
4535,At this point I don't really care about the people not wanting vaccines just because I want to get mine as soon as I can but come summertime it's going to be annoying if things like concerts still stay closed because of stubborn people.
4536,I agree.
4537,It's like measuring a sprinters speed a second after the start and suggest it would take 30s to finish a 100m race.

4577,That'd change 28.7 mil cases to 30.2 mil cases.

4607,"I'm better now and for the first time in my life I'm pain free, but it was really bad for a while there."
4608,&gt;This is a zoonotic disease and the Amazon rainforest has limitless potential for wildlife reservoirs and every jump from humans to animals results in more mutation than human to human transmission.

This isn't how that works at all."
4610,[Bats are unique in their ability to let viruses mutate within them.

4635,That doesn't mean we should get rid of mask mandates when we know they reduce the spread.
4636,The vaccine is literally being rolled out right now.
4637,Will it really kill you to wear a mask for a few more months during a global pandemic?
4638,I guess I just don't understand being this selfish.
4639,I think the original post was saracasm

4650,Southern California is currently at zero indoor dining occupancy (unless that restaurant happens to be flouting the rules).
4651,"I don't know that it will stay this way for 3 more months, but I can see at least 6 weeks to perhaps 2 months, especially for LA County, unless something drastically changes in how local leaders view the COVID restrictions."
4652,I can’t imagine that a large portion of the population being vaccinated and outside would cause a surge.
4653,Hopefully you are wrong.
4654,"The only reason we are still dealing with this on the scale that we are is morons keep doing what they shouldn't do, and saying stupid shit like ""if you think people will dealt with this untill... ""

Those people are why things have drug out this long, why 500k people are dead, and why this is going to drag on far longer still."
4655,that is because you don't care when people get sick and die.

4669,For sure.
4670,"If people are outdoors, no reason masks should be mandated."
4671,I was just pointing out what was going on.
4672,"If the mask mandate were lifted because 70% of people are vaccinated and cases are down, down, down, then yes."
4673,"But to lift it, because in a few months people will be vaccinated (hopefully enough) and cases are down, seems stupid."
4674,"explain what you mean by mass re-infections and ""manaus variant"", I haven't heard anything about either of these things."
4675,It's ok the J &amp; J vaccine are for less valuable people so it works out.

4700,Their result will basically determine whether restrictions continue or not.
4701,Those of us in NYC remember when Cuomo punished us for bad numbers in Florida and Texas.
4702,It has to be something to do about the weekend.
4703,Same reason why Sunday and Monday have traditionally less new cases and deaths compared to Wednesday and Thursday.
4704,Remember when they put in release the numbers for the days vaccines its actually the values from the day before.
4705,Thats why theyre put up so early in the day.
4706,"&gt; I agree with the majority of what you said, but in fairness there was a shitload of mixed signals coming out of various offices that led to a lot of confusing messaging."
4707,"In my state it went from ""2 weeks to flatten the curve"" to ""Ok by summer things should be back to normal"" to ""no normal until a vaccine."""
4708,"This seems less confusing messaging, and more that there were a lot of unknowns about covid early on that were answered as time went on."
4709,It's really not.
4710,"Not every vaccine provides sterilizing immunity, you just have an easier time fighting off the virus, not necessarily preventing you from being a carrier and transmitting it while sick."
4711,Is it a color issue or a poverty issue though?

4773,I am in OC California.
4774,And really struggling to find availability in the area.
4775,Which will be amazing timing.
4776,Full capacity a month or so before schools open for fall.
4777,Safe is key considering the country was likely going to be fully open whether we liked it or not.

4789,Arizona when it hears this knowing it won't be a global hotspot anymore: today is a good day!
4790,Agreed.
4791,The whole point should be to ensure high risk groups that want vaccinations have equal access.

4793,Not good.

4798,"I understand that some studies are pointing to 1 dose having a good efficacy, but we still have to go with the current track."

4804,I was one of those!
4805,I'm in college.
4806,Most of the latter half of my sophomore year and all of my junior year will have been in quarentine.

4832,The measures these offices would need to put in place for long term WFH monitoring and compliance may be prohibitive.

4834,"Or, if you're in a country that is vaccinating at a snail's pace, sometime in 2023. :("
4835,So easing restrictions shouldn't be an issue then?

4849,"I mean, in order to lockdown people and close borders, emergency powers are triggered immediately, but vaccines can wait for the celerity of ""business as usual"" bureaucracy."
4850,No exaggeration here.
4851,I know it won't happen but the comission and EMA should be investigated and prosecuted.
4852,This is failure at a criminal level
4853,"I'm not new here, the ""lift all restrictions"" crew is just overly sensitive to critical opinions."
4854,No one you are replying to here is talking about controlling others.
4855,With how wide spread Covid still is you need to keep in mind that the vaccine is not 100% effective.
4856,About 1 in 20 people are still vulnerable after two doses.
4857,"This fact is significantly mitigated when most of the population is vaccinated, but until that time, it is worthwhile act under the assumption that you personally may still be vulnerable to Covid even after the vaccine."
4858,Have you ever been to literally any rural area?
4859,There is still a valid argument for the fact the idiots beat us to herd immunity before the vaccine could.
4860,Most of the recent case declines were too early and fast to be from vaccine.
4861, sadly
4862,"You mean, in my theoretical universe where we were doing another year of this?"

4872,The world is a Twilight Zone episode right now.
4873,It's not just about what people think of themselves (although I know that is very high of their priority list).
4874,It also undermines confidence in the approval process and therefore the vaccines themselves.
4875,don't know you got downvoted - the media in the UK is responsible for many a death on their own and for some reason the BBC seem to want to join in on the tabloid fun
4876,Literally nothing in that memo says any change to testing standards.

4901,"i think the issue with surface transmission isnt that the virus cant live on a surface, its the amount of virus able to be transmitted via surfaces."

4903,"i dont know how viral load is quantified so i can only explain it like a very very stupid person, but i think it basically goes like this - say you need a viral load of 10 to be infected with covid."
4904,"someone who already has covid sneezes on a surface, and now that surface has a viral load of 10. you come along and touch the surface, and pick up some of the covid."
4905,"now your hand has a viral load of 7. you touch your mouth or nose, some of the covid goes from your hand into your respiratory system, and now you have a viral load of 5, which is not enough to become infected with covid."
4906,"its still possible to catch it via surfaces, but im pretty sure that is a very basic and very stupid explanation on why its much harder to catch via surfaces than respiratory droplets."

4953,i can't even imagine what it'll be like going to a grocery store or restaurant or the movies again... it seems absolutely surreal to think about.
4954,i think oct/nov will be my personal mental limit.
4955,i'll be vaccinated (hopefully most people will be?
4956,"), i'll still wear a mask, i'll be careful in social interactions... but i think something has to give at that point."
4957,it seems like risk should be almost non-existent by then if i'm understanding right.
4958,People like that give them a bad name.
4959,My dad and grandpa are both chiropractors and are actively going out of their way to help their patients schedule vaccine appointments.
4960,Although there are plenty of crazies in that line of business.
4961,The only thing I had was a super painful arm but no other side effects.
4962,AIDS has the morality/hate aspect to it.
4963,"""Who cares it's only a bunch of gays."""
4964,It makes it so it's really not comparable to something like a respiratory illness that's passed by droplets.
4965,"Of the others, does anyone care about them so much either?"
4966,It seems like the only time we really care about a pandemic years after the fact is if there is a more human conflict (AIDS) or it kills a meaningful percentage of people (the black death).
4967,You realize forcing a child to clear their plate is dumb and also one of the early life behaviors in American culture that is thought to strongly contribute to obesity right?
4968,**If** a single vaccine was enough “changing plans mid execution” would just mean a memo that says “don’t schedule people for their second dose”.
4969,It wouldn’t be an act of Congress.

4976,If you believed donald that's on you.
4977,Ok but the “last times we opened up” we weren’t swimming in vaccines
4978,This is a pretty awesome chart: https://imgur.com/KkmeygI
4979,You're missing the point.
4980,Most of the 'long haulers' aren't bed-ridden with POTS.
4981,We're not talking about those people.
4982,I was talking about the countless people who have symptoms exactly mirroring anxiety who are being told by doctors there is nothing wrong with them.
4983,Obviously if someone has organ damage then that's a whole new story.
4984,"But go on the long-haulers sub and you will count on one hand the number of people who have been diagnosed as having permanent, debilitating organ damage."
4985,The vast majority of sufferers are self-diagnosed and suffering from anxiety.
4986,The things you listed earlier as not being anxiety because of your own personal experience actually are.
4987,"Brain fog, fatigue, shortness of breath, headaches etc can all be a symptom and it's not even remotely rare."
4988,What do they think the vaccine has in it?
4989,Microchip?
4990,Tell them we don't have the technology to make anything that small that would do something.
4991,"At most an RFID type of tag could be injected (even those are much, much too big right now), but to do anything with it you would need to be in close proximity to anything to read it."

4998,Only a fool would believe that the government would be more efficient than the private sector at distributing vaccines.
4999,Walmart can do 16-18m/mo by themselves.
5000,I’m sure Walgreens and CVS can do more.
5001,I’m waiting until two weeks Post-Arctic blast to judge whether we’re in for another wave and there’s a need to hunker down again.
5002,"I had a moderate reaction from the first dose with the symptoms above, and after my second one, all I felt for roughly 48 hours was a very sore arm and exhaustion."
5003,Was only out of work one day.
5004,Second one was far better for me.
5005,Good luck though!
5006,Thank you for doing your part and getting vaccinated.
5007,"Because a lot of us can't get vaccinated yet, so if someone claims they've been vaccinated so they can take their masks off and act like the pandemic doesn't exist, it puts the rest of us at risk."
5008,"After *after* we've all been vaccinated, a certain percentage will be vulnerable either because they medically can't get a vaccination, or because they're among the unlike few who the vaccine doesn't fully protect."
5009,"imo, right before, around, or on Memorial day things will be mostly relaxed with a few caviats."
5010,While all the European countries are reversing course?

5027,*
5028,- I learned that I am a decent cook.
5029,"- I spend more time socializing now, tho remotely, than I ever did before."
5030,"- The distinction between especially close friends who I’d normally see or call regularly and far-away or situational (e.g., book club or just at Christmas) friends is now blurred in a good way."
5031,- Extraverted &amp; previously-busy buddies who are being pandemic-careful have more time for me now and everyone seems to text all the time.
5032,- Relationships with introvert buddies have deepened tremendously as we share more and more often.
5033,- Relationships with people who didn’t slow down during the pandemic are more or less on hold.
5034,They’re about as busy as before but we aren’t getting together and the amount of time they spend typing to friends on the computer hasn’t increased.
5035,It will be interesting to me to see how things shake out once the virus is under control.
5036,Will I see text-based buddies in person more often?
5037,Will my on-hold relationships snap back?
5038,Will some of my new pandemic friendships fade?
5039,I think yes.
5040,restaurants have been open in some capacity since mid-pandemic in my city except for a period around the holidays.
5041,most of them have built out outdoor setups and are packed constantly.
5042,"&gt; even just eating fast food garbage you can avoid being obese, it's really not that hard."
5043,Its... pretty damn hard to eat fast food often and not be overweight without being hungry quite a bit.
5044,I agree with the rest of your comment though.
5045,Its a cultural problem.
5046,"""Big is beautiful"" mindsets will kill more than anything else in human history in the end."
5047,"Don't panic, but continue to take precautions for the next couple of months."
5048,Wow.
5049,I knew March would be the best month for vaccination yet but I didn’t think we’d start seeing numbers like this so early.
5050,"Correct me if I’m wrong, but isn’t way too early to know anything reasonable about the durability of the vaccine?"
5051,Best solution to this is to get delete facebook
5052,Reeeeeeeeeee!
5053,"&gt; We are the richest country in the world, no business should have shuttered solely due to the pandemic restrictions."
5054,"While I agree with your underlying point that small businesses do deserve more support than they got, keep in mind that a lot of restaurants were operating on pretty thin margins even before the pandemic."
5055,Others depended on customer circumstances that may never completely come back.
5056,For a concrete example from the Seattle area....
5057,"Since the first big outbreak in the US happened around here, a lot of the big tech companies had people WFH a week or two before there were any official city/county/state stay-at-home orders; this meant that downtown Seattle became a ghost town overnight."
5058,Around two dozen restaurants which catered to the business lunch crowd went under even before there were any formal pandemic restrictions.
5059,"And depending on how WFH trends go from here, I don't know how many will be able to come back."
5060,We should calm down a little bit about this study.
5061,"They only studied 248 people, while the Pfizer vaccine trial tested 44,000 with half receiving the vaccine."
5062,"According to the study [“Adult patients who have excess weight or obesity are among the most impacted by COVID-19, and they make up more than 70% of the U.S. population."
5063,"Indeed, as I read through the Pfizer vaccine trial data, I saw that very familiar group: 70% of the Pfizer COVID-19 trial participants, like the U.S. demographic, had overweight or obesity.”](https://theconversation.com/will-the-covid-19-vaccine-work-as-well-in-patients-with-obesity-152782)

Pfizer accounted for this in the vaccine trial and it was shown to be highly effective at 94%."
5064,So mask mandates should start being lifted for vaccinated folks?
5065,?
5066,New Zealand doesn't exist /s
5067,"To be fair, if you had Covid hopefully you wouldn’t be anywhere besides home."
5068,They don't give a fuck.
5069,Russia meddles in foreign elections and poisons detractors with impunity.
5070,"If it makes you feel any better, it's really only the US, UK, Isreal and a small handful of other countries (mostly Asian) actually getting vaccines into people."
5071,"We are fucked here in the EU as well (especially here in Czech Republic, it's worse than Bergamo last year)

But yes."
5072,I can already see us getting left behind
5073,What they're chomping at the bit to do has no bearing on what is the best course of action.
5074,It’s like people who don’t finish their antibiotic course.
5075,Not wearing your mask after you have recovered invites mutations to take hold in the population.
5076,It won’t be a requirement for anything until it’s beyond emergency approved.
5077,I think you’re being way too optimistic about antivaxxers as well.
5078,"With Western vaccines, you don't have to ""think"" whether corners have been cut or not."
5079,"The results of the trials are public and suggest that the studies are well-founded, with participant numbers by far exceeding that of pre-Pandemic clinical trials."
5080,What is vaccine skepticism like in your country?
5081,Here in Ireland 95% said they will take it up from 75% in December
5082,You mean you'd defecate in the street without public shame?
5083,"Personally, it's internal shame that would keep me from doing that."
5084,"However, all this ""public shaming"" (ie, complaining on the internet) doesn't seem to have helped."
5085,Plenty of people go maskless.
5086,"Okay, wow, you’re really chasing shadows, and your other comments have come across as extremely anti-vax."
5087,"The WHO definition is exactly the same, even down to “through vaccination or previous infection”, all they added was a recommendation to do that *through vaccination so that hundreds of thousands more don’t die*."
5088,I’m really not sure what point you’re trying to make there.
5089,You’re seeing nefarious intents in the WHO saying “we recommend vaccination”.
5090,No definition was changed and no science was erased; I have less than zero clue what you’re even talking about.
5091,"&gt;Note also how the Covid-19 vaccine does not prevent reinfection, does not provide immunity to the virus, and will still require masks and social distancing."
5092,Every number I’ve seen shows 90-95% effectiveness.
5093,"That’s just the nature of vaccines, and is more than enough to provide herd immunity."
5094,"Once everyone received the vaccine, masks and distancing could be halted."
5095,Those precautions are only necessary until everyone gets the vaccine.
5096,The issue is with anti-vaxxers that will continue to spread it and keep us from achieving herd immunity—i.e.
5097,protecting those who are immunocompromised and thus aren’t benefitted by the vaccine.
5098,"&gt;Wasn't there a study done in California last year which estimated that the asymptomatic population was likely 40 times higher than what was being identified, meaning most of us probably had it and it didn't even affect us?"
5099,Maybe?
5100,"You’re assuming that 40x in the early days equals 40x today, which doesn’t really make sense."
5101,"And even if so, you said yourself that cases and deaths keep going up... so obviously we need greater immunity."
5102,&gt;And what happened to the flu?
5103,"The flu is not a novel virus starting from zero, first of all."
5104,"Second of all, COVID is extraordinarily transmissible, far far far more than the flu."
5105,I.e.
5106,"those precautions work better on the flu than on COVID, but that doesn’t mean they’re ineffective."
5107,How else do you think COVID spreads?
5108,You think there’s some unexplained vector and the masks and distancing are just a ruse?
5109,"&gt;Why didn't anyone cancel Black Friday, but they wanted to cancel Thanksgiving?"
5110,What the hell are you talking about?
5111,"Ah, okay, I can see those gears chugging in your head now."
5112,"This is about “cancel culture”, some nefarious scheme to... cancel Thanksgiving and Christmas?"
5113,"People don’t travel for Black Friday, first of all, which is what the holiday concern was about."
5114,"CDC also recommended against New Years and Super Bowl parties, is that cancel culture too?"
5115,And pretty sure everyone saying “stay home” was also saying “don’t cram yourself pole-to-hole inside a Best Buy”.
5116,"&gt;If the government cares so much about our health, why are there no recommendations on healthy living?"
5117,"Take vitamins, eat right, get exercise, and get plenty of rest?"
5118,"There are 100 quadrillion articles online telling you to eat healthy, exercise, and take vitamins, and a ton of those are from the government."
5119,Why are they not included in COVID recommendations?
5120,Because exercising and hitting your macros isn’t gonna protect you from a highly infectious airborne pathogen.
5121,Staying away from people does.
5122,You’re just yelling at clouds now.
5123,"&gt;I've got lots of questions, and you all should too."
5124,"Remember what they taught you in school, there are no stupid questions."
5125,And it's how science works.
5126,"We do have questions, we’re asking and answering them and abiding by our findings."
5127,I.e.
5128,"masking, distancing, and getting the vaccine to achieve herd immunity without incredibly unnecessary deaths."
5129,"There may be no stupid questions, but there are incredibly stupid people saying incredibly stupid things because they don’t understand what questions to ask, much less the answers they receive."
5130,"You say “that’s how science works”, yet you’re sitting here questioning the WHO and vaccines of all things, like you somehow know better than the entire scientific community."
5131,"I know you think you’re enlightened because you’re questioning basic science, but your entire comment is incredibly embarrassing and highly dangerous."
5132,Pfizer?
5133,"I have some brain fog today too, got my first dose yesterday."
5134,"Fwiw, this sounds a lot more like ""we're being extra cautious and waiting for more studies to come in before we make a sweeping recommendation for people to resume ordinary activity based on the assumption that vaccinated people won't spread the virus"" rather than ""we think vaccinated people are likely to be spreading the virus and also vaccines will not allow return to normal life indefinitely""."
5135,"On the other hand, it's incredibly surprisingly for them to be helping J&amp;J. Merck had multiple partnerships and vaccine candidates: two of them failed, the 3rd was Moderna."
5136,I'm guessing its because mRNA vaccines really are tricky to manufacture.
5137,Merck's other two candidates were also viral vector so I guess the resources they have lend more easily to J&amp;J.
5138,Q the “it’s doom porn” crowd.
5139,I've been trying to get an appointment for weeks.
5140,This morning I got 3 all at once.
5141,"Whoops, gotta cancel 2, but I'm happy that I'm finally gonna get vaccinated."
5142,"I don’t see the need for precautions because I believe that people should be allowed to make their own informed decisions...

Not that the precautions led to a 99.5% survival rate based off of CDC recommendations..."
5143,My fcking god the anti America hate on Reddit is tiring.
5144,Where are you from?
5145,I want to over analyze your culture to death and tell you why your people are stupid for thinking the way they do
5146,I stand corrected!
5147,Gotcha - makes more sense.
5148,For some mask wearing becomes a kind of signaling - including wearing it when there’s no reason to.
5149,Thats the main issue.
5150,You live in rural canada so obviously youre blind to whats going on in urban centres (where the vast majority of canadians live).
5151,"These restrictions dont make sense to you, i dont blame you for that, but i blame you for not doing research into how fucking bad this virus has been in population dense areas."
5152,"So yes, your complaining is still about you."
5153,The businesses in your town better hope the vaccines get here fast because thats the solution.
5154,"Opening up everything and letting more people die to save businesses in a small town is not logical, call me cruel but so be it."
5155,"Businesses can be resurrected, lives cannot."
5156,I’m not quite at the stage of being comfortable with indoor dining or larger gatherings or anything but now that cases are down locally and all of my high risk family has been vaccinated I’ve started getting together with them and small groups of friends (some of whom are also vaccinated) again and doing some of the things I’ve been putting off for a year now like getting work done on my house.
5157,It feels weird after so long basically seeing no one besides my doctor and grocery store workers but I’m ready to start taking some calculated risks.
5158,I know my risk isn’t zero by doing some of these things but I’m in a much better place personally with this virus than I was a year ago or even a couple months ago.
5159,It isn’t time to get rid of all precautions yet but I’m sure even the most careful people are starting to come to terms with living life again now that vaccines are here.
5160,It isn’t my turn yet but I can’t wait to get mine so I can really get back to doing all the things I used to enjoy.
5161,"While I agree that everyone should get whatever vaccine they can, it doesn't mean we should turn off our brains and say that all vaccines are 100%equalpleasestopaskingpeskyquestions."
5162,Of course we are allowed to compare vaccines and of course there may be attributes about one that are superior to another.
5163,That's nearly a tautology.
5164,A vaccine that prevents hospitalizations may still suffer from the drawback (for example) that it doesn't prevent transmission to unvaccinated children where it can cause rare cases of MIS.
5165,That may not be the overriding vital concern in an urgent crisis like ours...
5166,But you're really saying that it's not better to be informed about these tradeoffs and differences?
5167,"Ban incoming in 3, 2, 1..."
5168,Merck makes the lipids for Biontech vaccine in Germany.
5169,Their infrastructure is more suited for JnJ vaccine but they bought a company with mrna capability as well.
5170,Do I have to put a /s on the thing?
5171,Sigh.
5172,In NYC we are quite literally on top of people and it’s just kind of become normal to wear masks everywhere no matter what (for good reason IMO).
5173,"I’ve gone massless at the park and stuff, but I guess what I meant by my original comment is I look forward to not having to grab the mask at all when I walk out the door!"
5174,Lol.
5175,Facts.
5176,Go back to your echo chamber.
5177,Am I supposed to be surprised
5178,Call your local vax provider and get put on a standby list.
5179,"As long as you can get there in a short amount of time when they call back, you may be able to get one as soon as this week."
5180,I got one last night on standby.
5181,How much do you know about them and what is the source of your information?
5182,Are you aware of Guantanamo Bay?
5183,Police black sites?
5184,"Information purging by Facebook, Twitter, and Google?"
5185,You are tarring a country of one billion people with a single brush.
5186,That takes some serious statistical confidence.
5187,I'm not talking about both doses.
5188,Only 1 in 5 have recieved one or more doses compared to 1 in 3 in the UK.
5189,Ok
5190,"&gt;So there are things, even if you’re vaccinated, that you’re not going to be able to do in society: for example, indoor dining, theaters, places where people congregate."
5191,That’s because of the safety of society.
5192,"Ok, but I'm (and millions of others are) doing all of those things right now without being vaccinated."
5193,TF is this messaging.
5194,From the start of the vaccine push I wondered why each separate country had to do their own safety testing and such.
5195,With such a worldwide crisis why (for example) couldn't the UK and Germany share data and trial results and together approve the vaccine in both countries?
5196,On a personal level I wouldn't trust a German scientist or pharmaceutical company any less than a British one.
5197,Is it just red tape here?
5198,"Surely progress would have been monumentally quicker if say Germany took the moderna trials, the UK the AZ, Netherlands the biontec etc then when any one of the countries approved all the others look at the data and go ""fine with me""."

5206,The good news is that they will never have to discard Johnson &amp; Johnson vaccines.
5207,"Standard refrigeration is fine, and if people want to wait for Pfizer or Moderna, give Johnson &amp; Johnson to the next willing person."
5208,Yep Merck is in New Jersey.
5209,"Excellent news, absolutely, but it won’t increase output for a while."
5210,Will take 2 months to be up to speed helping with bottling and longer to be fully manufacturing the vaccine at Merck.
5211,"It will be a huge help, no question."
5212,"This isn’t a criticism, just an observation that the output won’t change  much from this until June."
5213,Not that I wish to infer causation from correlation but it feels hard not to tie this in some way to Macron  making bullshit statements about efficacy of the vaccine
5214,It’s like “20%” which will go down.
5215,And if they want to die off that’s their choice.
5216,Kids are in trials now so they’ll get vaccinated as well.
5217,It will end up being some type of requirement for schools too.
5218,"The bottleneck isn't sticking needles in people's arms, it's manufacturing the vaccine."
5219,"Not only that, but there was (and still is) risk that the virus could mutate beyond the efficacy of the vaccine, and we still aren’t sure how long antibodies last for."
5220,"Every year there’s a risk that the flu vaccine won’t be able to stop a new strain of the flu, and we can probably expect that to be possible with covid vaccines as well."
5221,We are all a joke compared to responsible countries like New Zealand.
5222,I think lockdown restrictions should be gone if hospitals aren't overwhelmed because those are people's jobs on the line.
5223,"Masks on the other hand are the easiest thing in the world to do, so I think waiting a couple months until the vaccine is widely available to rescind the mandate makes more sense."
5224,I understand where you're coming from though.
5225,This is a weird correction to make.
5226,Janssen is the developer of the vaccine regardless of being owned by J&amp;J.
5227,They are one of J&amp;J's ~250 subsidiary companies and not just the name of a department.
5228,This would be like correcting someone that it's actually Yum Brands who developed the Crunchwrap Supreme because they own Taco Bell.
5229,Both are technically correct but the parent's comment is more precise.
5230,Janssen is who developed the vaccine.
5231,Really?
5232,Not per the [CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/more/science-and-research/transmission_k_12_schools.html)
5233,"When I bookmarked [worldometers](https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/), there were 82,723 cases and 2,817 deaths."
5234,I try to not check it daily.
5235,I can't wait till I can delete that bookmark and never think about it again.
5236,u/minkymonk42069 is an all-out disinformation op account.
5237,"Yesterday, this guy was pushing the Covid hoax nonsense about how Covid deaths are vastly exhaggerated (the deaths ""with"" covid, not from covid crap.)."
5238,You're not just quoting Fauci.
5239,You're literally chopping out all the parts of his comment where he makes it clear things can't change right away because spread is too high.
5240,And risk of the vaccine vs. risk of the virus is absolutely something that's going to be considered.

5278,All of our scheduling sites are broken no one knows what’s going on I can’t get my parents who are 80 vaccinated nor my wife who works in healthcare.

5288,So you're hoping for a super variant?
5289,I think Fauci's point is that we need to wait until more people are vaccinated to relax things like mask mandates or capacity restrictions are indoor businesses.
5290,The daily threads are typically for asking these kinda questions.
5291,No need to be rude
5292,"Yep, if I were getting just 1 dose, I'd go with the J+J one as it seems the efficacy rate is possibly 30% higher with 1 dose of the J+J vaccine compared to 1 dose of the mRNA ones."
5293,I've only had the flu once and that was 30 some years ago but it sucked ass.
5294,I ended up in the ER because I had a crazy high fever and was dehydrated.
5295,The flu is nothing to mess around with and I wouldn't want to deal with it ever few years but I'm just ready to be done with mask even though I know I have many more months of wearing one.

5300,My argument is against the 6ft and 15 minutes rule.
5301,It's not based on common knowledge or science.
5302,I'm a plasma engineer.
5303,Ask me about small particles that are there one second and then they are not....a virus is not one of them.
5304,How much of that is testing availability?
5305,Oof.
5306,Thank you!
5307,We're not going to stop mutations.
5308,That's what viruses do.
5309,"Also, the vaccines are very effective."
5310,Covid won't mutate to the point where they're not effective that quickly.
5311,"The assumption that what we do has control over what happens is quote arrogant, and the variants are not something to freak out about, they've been around for some time before the reporting ramped up."
5312,Merck also is manufacturing custom lipids for biontech vaccines in Germany.
5313,"I wasn’t but ok lmfao, there are a ton of trolls who post  sentiments like that just to get attention."
5314,That’s awful!
5315,"My sister is having a hard time finding a vaccine, even though she is a mother of a specials needs child."
5316,Her husband is also a doctor in the hospital so an added layer of risk.
5317,Hoping she gets the vaccine soon!
5318,A giant percentage of the population won’t get vaccinated... kids and antivaxxers.
5319,That’s a vast majority so I dunno how this just stops anytime soon.
5320,So I’m not trying to be one of those that make up reasons not to wear one.
5321,"But masks, besides the blue ones, make me feel like crap."
5322,"I’ve tried various cloth, kn95’s, &amp; n95’s."
5323,Every time my throat will kill me &amp; I’ll have a horrible head ache/migraine for that day &amp; the next.
5324,"The first few times I obviously was freaked out thinking I had covid, after testing those times &amp; negative, I realized it was the masks."
5325,I think they cause my nose to run &amp; drain.
5326,"Which makes my throat raw, &amp; also head aches."
5327,"However, I’m a sahm with a 6 yr old &amp; 8 month old."
5328,So I stay home all the time anyways.
5329,"My daughter is in virtual classes, &amp; we do grocery pick up."
5330,So I just don’t really go out unless it to the doctors.
5331,But I would really love to go out without masks for sure.
5332,"&gt; Not a single variant or other HCoV (human coronaviruses - SARS, MERS, SARS-CoV-2) will be able to escape the antibodies."
5333,Guaranteed?
5334,Phew.
5335,"I just Googled ""COVID antibody escape"" for the list of researchers that I need to send this to ASAP."
5336,Don't bother with these freaks.
5337,They're just coming to the realization that their overzealous freakishness resulted in them missing out on things for nothing.
5338,Either that or they're scared of having to revert back to a world where their basement dwelling is seen as anti-social behavior and not heroic.
5339,Calling dibs that it's my turn to say this tomorrow!
5340,"I mean, my employer told me i couldn't come back to work until my fever was gone for at least 24 hours."
5341,"So yeah, we do restrict people who have the flu."
5342,I was out of work for a week.
5343,"Yeah, a lot has changed in a couple of weeks."
5344,"I think we're close to  the best point we can be at in terms of doses available, people able to administer them, and logistics."
5345,Soon the issue will be there being too much supply and not enough people signing up to get vaccinated.
5346,Really hope there isn't a bunch of wasted vaccines when so much of the rest of the world desperately needs them.
5347,I'm sure they'll adjust to the decline in demand in relation to supply when we reach that point though.
5348,May also do nothing for existing variants already spreading
5349,anyone in CT: do you know if hospice volunteers are eligible to get the vaccine?
5350,"my agency didn't know, but I'm looking at the website and it says:
• Paid and unpaid people serving in healthcare settings with potential for direct or indirect exposure to patients of infectious materials."
5351,i'm an unpaid person in a healthcare setting with direct exposure to patients.
5352,"but since nobody seems to know for sure if hospice ""counts"" in this way, didn't know if anyone else who volunteers with hospice knows the answer, especially in CT which now switched to a totally age based roll out"
5353,Now this is the art of the deal.
5354,"Amazing how you are screwing your neighbors too, stopping exports to Mexico and Canada."
5355,It is
5356,It's cute that you think no one can clean a Debit card after use in the store.
5357,Or that you can't leave your other items without getting shit all over them.
5358,Or that you can't buy groceries without a phone.
5359,Or that you can't clean your gloved hands before you touch your keys or car.
5360,&gt;I’ve never seen somebody sanitize their gloved hands.
5361,"Just because **you're** doing it wrong, doesn't mean that others are, or that it cannot be done properly."
5362,"Every single time I'm in a public store or my wife is in a public store, or her parents, or my kid (none of which are ever together, one person shops to minimize our risk), we all manage to sanitize our gloves before touching anything unnecessarily."
5363,Just because you're not paying attention to what other people are doing isn't an example of you being right.
5364,I got downvoted to infinity when few months ago I suggested India should not export vaccines until the high risk population of India was vaccinated 😔
5365,It's a risk you have to take
5366,What doesn't add up to you?
5367,100 million doses is enough to cover 10% of the adult population with 2 doses + an additional % with only 1 dose.
5368,How many adults in the US do you think there are?
5369,"&gt; Problem is, at least in the case of Moderna, the US actually funded those manufacturing plants."
5370,"Pfizer is a different story, but the agreement was always that the US based plants would be making the US doses."
5371,"Canada is not asking for the Moderna vaccine, so I don't know why that's relevant."
5372,The US first agreement is exactly what people are questioning.
5373,"There's a Pfizer production facility in Michigan, close to the Canadian border."
5374,Pfizer still had to upgrade the Belgian facility and provide Canada from there.
5375,Jesus Christ if you think this is the most significant global event since WWII you must have never cracked a history book in your life.
5376,And/or you are about 15 and no perspective on what is significant or not.
5377,[removed]
5378,Wouldn't that kneecap companies' ability to recoup their R&amp;D costs?
5379,Even Oxford didn't go that far and set up licensing agreements.
5380,Is the other high risk person also vaccinated?
5381,"So they can be ignorant, but I can’t tell them to stop being ignorant by taking their head outta their ass?"
5382,"""This was my favorite COVID moment personally."
5383,"DAE think this virus needs a reboot?"""
5384,Cheaper than an aircraft carrier!
5385,"Yes 2 is more effective, look at J&amp;J it ""only"" hit 70%."
5386,So I don't think you can say one dose of Pfizer at 80+ is a huge risk and can't be done while you approve J&amp;J at 70ish percent.
5387,This is a false equivalence.
5388,The US gov used an executive order to overrule a private company.
5389,Canada did not.
5390,US gov does not pay Pfizer to be their exclusive supplier nor do they pay a fee to make them a priority.
5391,US gov also did not fund any research for Pfizer as they did with Moderna.
5392,"You want to compare this with Moderna, fine."
5393,But in the end the US overruled a private company to help themselves.
5394,The world would be worse off if every country acted like this.
5395,"Novavax is the easiest of all of them to tweak for new variants, so they can have multi-strain shots sooner that can bring them into parity with Pfizer's stellar performance without the super cold chain."
5396,THIS.
5397,"At some point, WE will need to decide when we are at the appropriate level of risk to resume regular activities."
5398,"We cannot wait for our government to give us permission, that will never happen."
5399,Your freedom is not selfish.
5400,"Yeah, it sounds ridiculous because nobody talks like that."
5401,I really hope you're not a teacher.
5402,"I’m going to take any available vaccine, but my concern with the Johnson and Johnson vaccine is, does it protect against scarring in the lungs and damage to the heart in mild cases?"
5403,Only old people and front line workers that have been vaccinated so far.
5404,More or less.
5405,Therefore not a good sample of the general population.
5406,Front line workers are mostly doctors and nurses who have medical training and are far more likely to get a vaccine than anyone.
5407,All the anti-vaccination idiots I have talked to here are middle aged or younger but I have met quite a few of them.
5408,None of them are doctors or nurses Edit: I realise this is anecdotal but it stands to basic logic / reason also
5409,I had my fever get up to 101.5 overnight!
5410,"But it ended up going away really quickly after I got out of bed and took a fever reliever, then I was fine the rest of the day."
5411,"Slight soreness and tiredness too, but I'd attribute that more to the shitty night of sleep if anything."
5412,Kids not being vaccinated.
5413,DEFINITELY kids not being vaccinated.
5414,The media is already priming the pump on that one.
5415,"In Israel despite having vaccinated 50% of population and 90% of ages 50 and up, the R coefficient is actually climbing up."
5416,There is some drop in deaths and hospitalizations but less than anticipated.
5417,"Obviously do what you're comfortable with, but I'd feel morally comfortable signing up at that point."
5418,I can't imagine any reasonable person getting outraged that a hospice volunteer who works with patients getting vaccinated as a healthcare worker.
5419,Get the first vaccine you can get.

Any answer you get that is either ""yes"" or ""no"" is wrong, for now."
5481,"We have only ""maybe, probably not"", and it's going to be that way for a long time."
5482,"In order to answer the question scientifically, it would require a ""challenge study"" where both vaccinated and unvaccinated people are deliberately exposed to the virus to see if transmission occurs."
5483,The ethical concerns of deliberate exposure prevent us from performing these studies in humans.

5488,"However, it's unlikely that sterilizing immunity would be found in most vaccinated humans, if we even get sterilizing immunity at all."

5490,"Also, you'll notice that any reputable person talking about this subject always says ""may be able to spread"", or ""maybe"", or ""we don't know if""."

[**Conclusions**](https://gfycat.com/cleantalkativedassie)

Okay, so the vaccines reduce infections, and if someone gets an infection after getting vaccinated, they have fewer and reduced symptoms."
5535,This currently seems to also be true with post vaccination infection with any of the known variants.
5536,We are pretty sure this reduction is an indication that they'll reduce spread.
5537,Why?
5538,"We're pretty sure that they reduce spread because people who are truly asymptomatic barely spread the virus, and people with mild symptoms spread only slightly more, and people who go on to develop severe symptoms spread the virus really well."
5539,In other words: A reduction in symptoms is at least correlated with a reduction in the ability to spread the virus.
5540,Vaccines reduce symptomatic infections and symptoms in those who do get infected.
5541,"Therefore, vaccines should reduce spread."
5542,"If people develop immunity via clearing an infection, each subsequent variant they are exposed to will just broaden their immune response, likely without disease (symptoms)."
5543,"So they'll have good and broad immunity to a variety of variants, which seems likely to be an indication that they won't catch or spread the virus as well in the future."
5544,Same thing happens when someone who is vaccinated is exposed to a new variant.
5545,"Their immunity is broadened and strengthened by each subsequent exposure, likely without symptoms."
5546,"But remember, so many people will be less likely to spread the virus, so it's pretty unlikely that this reduced level of spread will be sufficient to sustain the virus in the way we have seen over the past year."
5547,"So if a variant becomes somewhat widespread, it'll hit resistance pretty quickly."
5548,"If they don't become widespread, Yay!"
5549,"I'm totally willing to have my mind changed on this with new information though, so don't take this as gospel."
5550,Tips on clarifying my terms/language/understanding appreciated.

5558,"Macron said the vaccine appeared “quasi-ineffective on people older than 65, some say those 60 years or older."""
5559,Words are right out of his own mouth.

From what I've seen conspiracy theories will flourish even with the truth, so I'm not sure there's much of a tradeoff there at all."
5595,"Especially during a pandemic, that's just a naturally ripe event for the loonies to come out."
5596,Maybe it's gotten lost in all the text but I don't necessarily think public health officials should be going around just lying every second.
5597,Obviously that will erode trust too much and ruin the chances of people listening.
5598,I started with the masks lie which people point to as a reason not to trust fauci and I strongly disagree with that (as I explained above).
5599,&gt; treating them as dumb provokes more dumb behavior because we’re essentially leaving them to their own devices to figure out what to do.
5600,They kinda already do though even without the conspiracy theory or lying stuff.

5602,Too many.

5609,"I'm sure that these talks started just about the time J&amp;J made their submission to the FDA, but it  takes time to work out the details."
5610,Biden is probably  involved more for anti-trust reasons that anything.

5612,The difference is probably the level of necessity.
5613,You do (generally) have to go into a grocery store to survive; you do not have to go into Home Depot.

5623,You are free to believe what you want.
5624,I am free to question what I want.
5625,The US wants their own studies for diversity reasons.
5626,Medications can affect different races differently.
5627,Most countries are less diverse.
5628,"As for other countries with more similar populations, I’m not sure."
5629,We sucks at messaging around the vaccines.
5630,Live in nyc and was listening to the Deblasio press conference and we have a specific plan for the J&amp;J doses we are receiving.
5631,We are bringing it to homebound seniors and going door to door.
5632,It makes a ton of sense - less storage requirements and just one and done.
5633,Don’t have to make a 2nd round at a later date.
5634,It’s likely in poorer neighborhoods/ those with large minority populations.
5635,He received two questions from journalists during the Q&amp;A about giving a vaccine with a lower efficacy to minority communities and perceived fairness.
5636,There’s already high vaccine hesitancy in some of these communities and we are seemingly adding to it.
5637,"I think he did do a good job answering the questions saying it prevented death + hospitalization in trials and said he himself will take the J&amp;J vaccine, but still it’s frustrating that this is such a large discussion."
5638,We have this on top of the messaging that those who are vaccinated need to continue living life as we did before they were vaccinated and it’s going to effect acceptance rates.
5639,"At the moment supply outstrips demand, but come the end of April we are going to be in the position where supply is in excess of demand and wondering how we fucked up things."
5640,"Yeah, it's almost all about how much you're eating rather than what you're eating."
5641,Until the world is vaccinated variants will keep popping up.
5642,So a billion doses made by and donated by the USA is some good diplomacy.
5643,I'll assume you're a troll.
5644,Either that or you are too stupid to understand the recommendations from health experts.

5659,Nooo America give me shots.
5660,"Isn’t it known that the virus does not spread outdoors, especially in sunlight?"
5661,I'm still being cautious since I've only had 1 dose of Pfizer/Biontech.
5662,"Sure I'll start feeling more relaxed about 14 days after the 2nd dose (since it can take up to that long after the 2nd dose to reach full efficacy, not immediately or within a few days)."
5663,2 weeks after the 1st dose may technically be enough to prevent me from getting sick enough to end up hospitalized or death but still don't feel comfortable letting my guard down.
5664,"Seems like J+J is more effective than the mRNA after 1 dose, it's not until after the 2nd dose the mRNA ones have higher efficacy rates (in preventing illness, all vaccines available in the US seem nearly 100% effective in preventing death)."
5665,"It's not that dangerous as in it is not very likely to cause death in healthy, young people, but it has shown that it causes long term or even permanent lung damage and/or cardiovascular damage even in low-risk groups."
5666,Even in people who were asymptomatic.

5682,"10% of the third largest country in the world, when the supplies started out very limited, in only two months is amazing."
5683,Two months is not that long at all.
5684,The pace is not only increasing but we are getting even more supplies.
5685,All adults who want it should be able to get it by the summer or even late spring.
5686,We don't need the whole country vaccinated.
5687,"We need 70 to 80% for herd immunity, and that's including all of the people who already have natural immunity."
5688,"But the country will open up long before herd immunity, when cases are low and hospitalizations are down."
5689,"That will happen when most of the vulnerable population is vaccinated, and they're first in line."

5718,"One day it’ll pop up yes, just because we’ve gotten there."
5719,"But we don't know the durability of the single dose regimen, it wasn't part of the trials."
5720,For all we know it could reduce the length of immunity from a year down to three months and then we're worse off than  if we were to just be patient and do it in the way that was officially studied and authorized
5721,It’s more the fact that we have no manufacturing capabilities because of poor decisions made years back.
5722,That is going to change but it takes time.

5731,"Compared with adults, children and adolescents who have COVID-19 are more commonly asymptomatic (never develop symptoms) or have mild, non-specific symptoms."
5732,I can’t isolate.
5733,My job doesn’t allow me to.
5734,I just feel we are being a little too optimistic and maybe moving a little too fast.
5735,&gt; That means the number of cases should not be dropping unless they are suddenly testing less people.
5736,As soon as you have Symptoms and need med.
5737,Treatment you get tested.
5738,That’s for asymptotic infection.
5739,As far as I can tell they haven’t presented any data here on symptomatic infection in individuals who only got 1 shot.
5740,"reading about this, i think the phrase here is 'sterilizing immunity,' which means it stops you from being a carrier."
5741,"if a vaccine does not provide sterilizing immunity, then you can still be a carrier."
5742,"[here's an article that talks about it](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/vaccines-need-not-completely-stop-covid-transmission-to-curb-the-pandemic1/), which mentions hepatitis b and whooping cough vaccines as ones that does not provide sterilizing immunity."

5746,"but since he didn't say we could sign up during 1a/we didn't get any updates really about being part of 1a, i didn't think we qualified for that round."

5749,I would recognize that as a valid response as long as you added on a mask mandate.

5758,"We really need to make testing easier, cheaper, to the point it's lick a stick at home in the bathroom."
5759,I guarantee you a shit ton of people think they had the flu when they had a typical coronavirus (bad cold).
5760,"An actual flu infection without the lessening severity effects of even an off strain vaccine is like actual torture, death warmed over, it's not just a ""take some advil and suck it up, buttercup"" event."
5761,"If you've had the strain before, sure, you probably developed some immune response and it might feel like a horrible cold, but it mutates a fuck ton and escapes those developed responses, that's a big part of why vaccines are necessary."
5762,I mean other than being deadly to a shit ton of people.

5776,Has this been tested (seriously asking)?
5777,"As far as I know, Pfizer and Moderna tested a 2-shot strategy with shots scheduled roughly a month apart."
5778,Not two months.
5779,Not three months.
5780,"We can't just assume ""one shot for more people is better"" when that specific regiment hasn't been tested."
5781,It's too big of a risk.
5782,"Unless, of course, there is evidence that supports 1 shot having long-term efficacy."
5783,[deleted]
5784,Read somewhere that they told the EU they were ready to ship doses the moment it got approved (probably meaning they have doses ready in storage as we speak).
5785,"So this means deliveries of Janssen should start next week (the EU is already producing the vaccine, as they are already exporting it to SA)."
5786,I know it shouldn't but it still kinda blows my mind that there are people like you out there in the real world.
5787,The point of the stats is to give us the general idea of the risk per age group.
5788,"So for me, my risk of death might not be *exactly* 0.003%, but the estimate is the best I can get."
5789,"We don't know the exact number for each individual, but the estimate will be close enough to go with."
5790,"Otherwise, if you just ignore that because the risk might be higher, you end up being a panicked hypochondriac."
5791,Less than 0.1% of the world's population died in the 1957 and 1968 flu pandemics.
5792,"They were bad years for flu, but not something people are interested in like they're interested in WWII."
5793,Spanish flu killed 1-6% of the world population and people don't care about that like they do WWI.
5794,That's the only point I'm trying to make.
5795,People aren't interested in pandemics like they are wars.
5796,Unless they kill a significant percentage of the population (like the black death killing 30%-60% of Europe's population) or there's a more human interest component like homophobia.
5797,Then you can make it something people want to talk about years after the fact.

Human Challenge Trials for Vaccine Development: regulatory considerations

&amp;#x200B;

**Human Challenge Studies to Accelerate Coronavirus Vaccine Licensure**

[https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32232474/](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32232474/)

&gt;However, we argue that such studies, by accelerating vaccine evaluation, could reduce the global burden of coronavirus-related mortality and morbidity."
5975,"Volunteers in such studies could autonomously authorize the risks to themselves, and their net risk could be acceptable if participants comprise healthy young adults, who are at relatively low risk of serious disease following natural infection, if they have a high baseline risk of natural infection, and if during the trial they receive frequent monitoring and, following any infection, the best available care."
5976,"&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Backed by a £33.6 million UK government investment, the first-of-its-kind study for this virus will involve ***establishing the smallest amount of virus needed to cause infection, which will give doctors greater understanding of Covid-19 and help support the pandemic response by aiding vaccine and treatment development."
5977,"***  
&gt;  
&gt;***Over many decades, human challenge studies have been performed safely and have played important roles in accelerating the development of treatments for diseases including malaria, typhoid, cholera, norovirus and flu."
5978,"*** The trials have also helped researchers establish which possible vaccine is most likely to succeed in phase 3 clinical trials that would follow, usually involving thousands of volunteers."
5979,Ok 63.09% then
5980,Good for them.
5981,Hopefully more states will follow suit.

5987,China can afford this vaccine diplomacy as they managed to contain covid-19 and the risk of it is pretty much nonexistent inside its borders.
5988,The West can't since it's overrun with covid-19 and needs to vaccinate itself first.

6022,Or California?
6023,Or Norway?
6024,"If there were a clear correlation between mask mandates and overall deaths per million, don't you think there'd be several studies on it by this point?"
6025,"https://ny.eater.com/2020/12/11/22169841/restaurants-and-bars-coronavirus-spread-data-new-york

Go through that list and determine where a mask mandate is helping."
6026,I would argue that 85% of those cases are unaffected by mask mandates.
6027,"So even if masks were 80% effective (which they likely aren't in practice), you could reduce your case and death count by 12%, maybe?"
6028,"The point, again, is that mandated masks have had very little effect on the end result to this point."
6029,Honestly large gatherings aren’t even the biggest issue it’s specifically large gatherings out side of your typical group.
6030,If you interact with the same 10 people who all only interact with you then it’s not as big of an issue.
6031,"Shut down bars and restaurants for sit down dining, move to curb side only, put a rent break on them so they don’t go under and this thing will be over in weeks with minimal damage."
6032,But for what ever reason people lose their dang minds when they are forced to eat their favorite restaurant’s food at their own dinner table instead of someone else’s
6033,"I volunteered to help distribute vaccinations in PA, definitely wont actually be giving the vaccines, but will be helping with other things."
6034,"If you can please volunteer, help is very much needed in PA."

6036,Texas: 2/3 months?
6037,"Fuck that, time to reopen now!"
6038,[removed]
6039,Can’t believe it is finally back to normal in Texas!
6040,I’m about to be brought to tears!
6041,No mask mandate and 100% capacity!
6042,Downvote all you want but this is some of the best news I’ve heard since last year.
6043,My nose always starts running if I wear a mask for more than an hour!
6044,What's that about?
6045,i mean that's the idea no?
6046,Yep.
6047,My dad died in February of Covid-19.
6048,"There wasn't even a zoom funeral, just a 12 minute recording of a generic religious eulogy given at his graveside."
6049,"I'd planned to drive down and visit in July after I was vaccinated, but then Connecticut bumped me to the back of the vaccine list (it's based on age, not need, as of last Monday."
6050,Unless you're in childcare or k-12 education).
6051,People 2 age brackets above me are saying their earliest available appointments are in May.
6052,"So yeah, I'd like to go back to normal."
6053,But I have no idea when that can happen.
6054,Anal pass.
6055,"Bro, look around you."
6056,People are openly defiant of Covid regulations.
6057,These arguments don't make any sense.
6058,The EU regulator approved it for all age groups.
6059,What did these countries know that their overall regulator didn't?
6060,"I thought it was still no unnecessary travel, social distancing, no family visits, etc"
6061,They used it in a made up way to invent a class of people who don’t exist who want the lockdowns which also don’t exist to go on forever.
6062,"The CDC has said the spike protein mutations affect the virus' ""antigenic profile""."
6063,"They added this ""may affect the ability of antibodies generated through a previous natural infection or through vaccination to recognize and neutralize the virus""."
6064,"Health officials say it is ""possible"" vaccines may be less effective against it, but more work is needed to establish whether that is the case."
6065,"So actually its an unknown, I am just saying it isn't 100% certain we are in the clear here."
6066,&gt; So what changed?
6067,The system changed.
6068,The food industry changed.
6069,"They started pumping sugar and HFCS in everything

Really can't be stated enough."
6070,"I lost 57 pounds in 6 months when I did keto, and I didn't even do it really that healthily."
6071,Cutting carbs basically just translated into looking at calories on things and thinking about it.
6072,Sugar is in EVERYTHING these days.
6073,Me too
6074,Ohh I see.
6075,I thought speaking with someone might get better results but you’re right.
6076,Being able to check for availability online during overnight hours makes sense.
6077,Not having to pay for medical care for me would be financial freedom.
6078,It took me forever to get my 3 year old to wear one.
6079,I finally had to get Paw patrol and PJ mask masks.
6080,He's pretty good at wearing one in stores now.
6081,Also my wife and I are vaccinate and are planning on going to europe in August and I know the plane will still enforce masks and I want him to be conditioned to wear one so we don't get kicked off.
6082,"https://youtu.be/AZ3dDSSvdwQ

That’s Sweden."
6083,I’m from New York and I’ll wear one out and about but will happily take it off if no one else is around.
6084,"Last summer or fall, I was eating a popsicle and walked past a restaurant with outdoor diners."
6085,One lady shouted “good job protecting your chin!
6086,Moron!” Real wtf moment because she was eating with her mask off.
6087,How is eating a popsicle on the move really any different?
6088,I need one...going nuts and seeing ominous predictions about next Winter is sending me over the edge.
6089,Everyone take much needed breaks.
6090,Whatever is going to happen is going to happen and you can suffer then and not before...like me.
6091,😩
6092,I think you proved my point.
6093,What do you think misinformation?
6094,Should we pretend convergent evolution isn’t happening while the same mutations emerge again and again?
6095,"The Novavax and AZ trial results for the placebo groups are not good, showing a previous case of covid did not offer immunity the SA variant."
6096,"Then Manaus Brazil reached herd immunity, last summer, but still had a huge spike after the variant emerged."
6097,Now we have the NY variant with the same E484k mutation.
6098,I don't live in the US but as an 18 year old I feel lucky to have gotten my first shot yesterday
6099,I got my second dose Wednesday and would have never gotten it if you told me my arm would still be hurting because my last vulnerable person is getting his first dose today- he’s twice my age.
6100,"Younger and healthier people, or people that were previously infected may be okay with one dose but not the vulnerable."
6101,I.e.
6102,people have more options to get fat.
6103,So the question now as legislators is: dare you take that option away and dwell into a wildly unpopular style of paternalism?
6104,"For the most part, their answer will be no, though you do see some token gestures like limiting soda size, and somewhat more effective measures like restricting what can be cooked in school cafeterias."
6105,"But if Mom and Dad stock the cupboard with fatty snacks and don't give a hoot, heck they'll down a bag of Doritos with Timmy (one bag each), there's not much the government can practically do to help."
6106,Education and personal accountability are the most practical avenues to get people eating right.
6107,"They may not resonate perfectly on an individual level, but work over time on a population level."
6108,Well the US is the only country that banned all exports of them so you could argue that this is unreasonable.
6109,"Feel like his biggest advantage is nothing to do with how he does, but more about who his opponent is..."
6110,"Seems like it's about forecasting/""race"" of vaccines against variants/infections."
6111,"&gt; Americans were never going to do *this* for more than a year

What a bunch of horseshit."
6112,There is no arbitrary time-line that Americans can handle or not.

6114,Cause Florida and Texas are in so much trouble right now right?
6115,"Covid is never going away, btw"
6116,I mean mono is known for having very long post viral sequele.
6117,My brother had mono in HS and was bedridden for almost a year like a fucking vegetable and had to have surgery to remove one of his lymphnodes because it became the size of a golf ball.
6118,Thats why I get so angry when people claim post viral sequele is just anxiety and PTSD.
6119,"No, its not."
6120,"People with post viral sequele can be incredibly physically sick and their immune systems are being blown out, leading to various awful symptoms."
6121,Just because you don't read about it often in the news doesn't mean it never happens.
6122,"You can go anywhere you want in the country, but some states still have quarantine requirements that are enforced with varying degrees of success."
6123,The decision that you have made to pretend that what has been happening for the last year isn’t happening is one which devalues human life.
6124,If you valued human life you would have found the courage to not put your fingers in your ears and be “lalala I can’t hear you.”
6125,Same.
6126,"I'm used to it at this point, it really doesn't bother me at all."
6127,The (admittedly stupid) thing that does bother me is that all my lipsticks are going to be expired and gross by the time I can wear them again lol.
6128,But I agree with your last point also.
6129,"I fully intend on masking when flu season rolls back around, or any time I think I might be sick."
6130,"It's just the courteous thing to do, and now it seems kind of crazy that we never did it before."
6131,The link you provided shows the majority of the named scientist in the article support the idea that asymptomatic people are a source of transmission.

6133,"This post appears to be about vaccines, please see [our FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/wiki/faq#wiki_where_can_i_find_information_about_the_mechanism_and_progress_of_vaccines.3F) for answers to frequently asked questions regarding the COVID-19 vaccines."

6142,"Like, you'd think the sample would include them too..."
6143,Just gain some weight.
6144,It looks like obesity is on the list.
6145,USAID has already been distributing covid supplies.
6146,I'd imagine they'll start distributing vaccines too once we get enough of the US covered.
6147,Source?
6148,It’s never going to be “fully over”.
6149,It’s also never been about being fully over.
6150,This whole time it has been about taking the stress off our hospitals.
6151,As soon as we are consistently taking the load off the hospitals we need to open back up.
6152,Flattening the curve has never been about reaching herd immunity or anything even close to it.
6153,Good now all the idiots who act like we have zero idea if something is true until there is a study on it can be quiet.
6154,I’m trying to provide context for people who don’t understand why America is willing to allow more infections to provide individuals with stronger protection.
6155,"We are not a particularly collectivist culture, and a lot of people would say we don’t want to be."
6156,Right or wrong.
6157,I don’t think the harsh cultures in Africa and elsewhere seem particularly interested in cooperating for the “greater good” either.
6158,I’d say marginalized Americans might be better able to understand what people from harder cultures than ours face than people who live in places with social safety nets.
6159,"I mean, if I get sick because I took a watered down vaccine, I probably won’t be able to pay the medical bills."
6160,Bill collectors won’t care that I took a lesser vaccine for “the greater good.” 😂
6161,We all know you don't have a girlfriend.
6162,Incorrect
6163,Yes but my premium is like $200 monthly compared to $8000.
6164,I'm not confused.
6165,Is that a dogwhistle you posted?
6166,Doctors I know recommend that you get covid vaccine even if you already had the virus
6167,I wouldn't get too focused in on 'Worldometer'.
6168,"I know everyone likes to look at numbers and tables but it's entirely reliant on the many, many different ways countries choose to measure and report their Covid stats."
6169,It's hardly rigorous as a tool of comparison.
6170,Lol.
6171,"Willing to go out bar hopping, but concerned about friend’s health."
6172,Why don’t you just drop off a pamphlet on temperance too?
6173,"Assuming you’re young enough to go bar hopping, your friends have as much risk from Covid as they have driving to the bar (before they’ve had a drink)."
6174,Jesus Christ
6175,"I just wish I could trust that when a municipality lifts a mask mandate, that would mean it was actually safe to not wear a mask."
6176,Indoor dining has been open here since last May and it's been varying degrees of risky that whole time.
6177,I'll be paying attention to the CDC and Fauci and a handful of epidemiologists with online presences that I've come to trust.
6178,Because the presence or absence local restrictions have proven to be meaningless when it comes to assessing risk.
6179,[deleted]
6180,Not true.
6181,AZ will be given to all ages
6182,"Yeah, I mean I think part of that is the deaths are still really high."
6183,Over 1k/day is terrible.
6184,"Once we start staying in the triple digits, I think the narrative might change."
6185,"Of course, the media is going to keep hyping stuff for clicks..."
6186,"I would ignore news sources that aren't AP/Reuters/NPR/BBC for a while, it's helping a lot with my baseline anxiety lol"

6192,I'm going to a wedding at the end of May too.
6193,"And no, it's not the best idea to get married in your late 30s or in your 40s if you're having children."
6194,Do you have a statistic on that?
6195,Everything I've read said people with thyroid issues and other conditions preventing them from losing weight are few and far between
6196,This is a really good way to put it.
6197,Maybe.
6198,But at 30% Israel wasn't noticeable at all.

6202,That’s nice dear.
6203,And it thankfully isn’t up to you.
6204,Except the fact that the likelihood of you catching the disease **does** increase based on the amount of time you are exposed to someone with the virus.
6205,"That isn't pulled out of my ass, so I would assume as that's the only real relevant part of the discussion that we would focus on that."
6206,"The number, which I did totally pull out of my ass, are only there to illustrate a point and aren't exactly accurate because I didn't have the source on me."
6207,"Feel free to disregard those examples, the point stays the same."
6208,Things are getting better.
6209,Take a technology break or at least a news break and that will help a lot.
6210,"That was your goal, maybe."
6211,But there are long term debilitating conditions as well.
6212,"The silent pandemic where people are disabled or their quality of life severely impacted from an infection that doesn't kill, at least not in the normal sense."

6214,Can anyone point me to any articles or studies that back this up?
6215,"I’ve seen this type of message repeated a couple times, but never with a huge backing of data or detail."
6216,I’ll remain cautiously optimistic and hope that the good news keeps coming in.
6217,You’re exactly right and every time I hear people commenting that they want years of research before they trust this vaccine only proves that they’ve done zero research on the vaccine and how it was developed.
6218,"What exactly do you mean by ""lockdown/shutdown insanity?"""
6219,"Countries that actually carried out an effective lockdown strategy, like New Zealand, have been faring much, much better than the rest of us, particularly us idiot Americans who made it into a political slapfight and screeched about the ""freedom"" to get a haircut."

6233,"&gt; Young people will be the last to be vaccinated, do they just have to wait longer to simply go to a bar or enjoy a movie?"
6234,"If the vaccinations go down the age ladder, then yes - which in turn means bars and movies won't open until young people are vaccinated, so there is no crush."

6332,"None of these are “anecdotal”, they provide actual data from controlled studies in lab settings to assess how long it stays in various environments and may address the specific mechanisms of transmission."
6333,As does the review article I linked.
6334,So what you said about there being only one study is completely false.
6335,Who cares if they get the vaccine?
6336,If they want Covid have at it.
6337,Hopefully they get antibodies to protect them or it thins the anti-vaxx herd.
6338,Cruel but at this point seriously who cares.
6339,Not really sure if a democratic government should be ordering around its citizens without the consent of the governed.
6340,Famotidine?
6341,Hello?
6342,It's like there was going to be this whole episode about investigating peasants with acid reflux in China and then...
6343,Nothing!
6344,So the alternative is to just let it happen?
6345,I didn't see Fauci out there anytime last year telling people to lose a few pounds if they were scared about getting sick considering the cardiovascular risks of the virus.
6346,"Especially after the mental and physical health effects on people last year, we should be encouraging people to get in shape more than ever this year"
6347,"Keep going everyone, we're almost there!"
6348,"&gt; And this is why I will continue to go to the gym no matter what reddit tells me

I somehow doubt that a meaningful number of redditors demanded that you stop going to the gym."
6349,I can't imagine why anyone would care.
6350,Are you saying that all priests lack a moral compass?
6351,"Or are you applying the same brush that, for example, bigots say about all black people, or all Muslims."
6352,You've obviously never been to Cumbernauld...
6353,"That would depend on your age, location, and theatre."
6354,The point is that those decrying this as an Orwellian nightmare are fucking idiots.

6357,"from the article: 

&gt;DeClerck lived through the 1918 Spanish flu at the age of 2, has seen both World Wars and the civil rights movement, been married three times and had three sons, six grandchildren, 12 great-grandchildren and 11 great-great grandchildren."
6358,"She’s battled heart failure, a lung infection and now COVID-19."
6359,...
6360,"Yes I'm more than aware of that thank you, I just mean to say food addiction is not simple to cure and I don't like to see people diminishing it as if it is."
6361,It's a true addiction.
6362,But is the infection rate higher than the rest of the country.....
6363,"Could be worse, could be your cubicle job never closed and nobody wears a mask :/ ask me how I know"

6368,"I mean, it has nothing to do with socioeconomic status—100% to do with healthcare-related jobs that are in high demand."

6373,"Food deserts aren't the ability to access food, it's the ability to have access to healthy foods such as fruits, vegetables, and other varieties of nutritious food at affordable prices in relation to the area's income level."
6374,Local grocery stores are considered a food retailer.
6375,It doesn't have to be a just a super market.
6376,Local food gardens and farmer's markets also provide the ability to access nutritious foods.
6377,Restaurants and convenience stores do not count because they generally have a limited variety of foods that constitute a healthy diet.
6378,The mile distinction for people that live in cities is to address low income families that are more likely to have less transportation methods.
6379,"So while yes, 1 mile is not far to travel."

6392,people die from covid because of covid.
6393,USAID is a front for the CIA.
6394,"Maybe that will still create some goodwill in desperately poor countries, but that's really the most you can hope for."
6395,&gt;I'm worked up because you're categorically saying long hauling is due to anxiety and PTSD without any evidence for it when there's plenty of evidence that post viral sequele is **not** a mental health issues and frankly never has been.
6396,"I didn't categorically say anything of the sort - I said that you could potentially attribute some of the milder lingering COVID symptoms to psychological factors because mild fatigue, headaches etc are fairly commonplace."
6397,You've taken that and run away with interpreting this as saying all long haul symptoms are caused by anxiety.
6398,&gt;Where is the research confirming that post viral sequele is anxiety?
6399,"There's very little good, controlled/non-counfounded research on long COVID at all, so there's no way to assess how much of self reported symptoms are in fact related to past COVID diagnosis - the only statement made was that some people might attribute some of the milder symptoms months after to long COVID when we're not sure if that's the case."
6400,"We'll know much more in a few months - as you've said yourself, budgets are only now really being allocated to treatment and study of long COVID."
6401,It's also odd that you're willing to completely dismiss the mental health aspects of having had COVID and their potential impact on anxiety.
6402,"Lon

&gt;It is incredibly unlikely that people with 10+ symptoms, previously young and healthy, now so sick and bedridden, are sick due to anxiety and PSTD."
6403,"Again, no one is talking about people with 10+ symptoms but you."
6404,These people obviously have long COVID.
6405,You're arguing with yourself.
6406,"I'm talking about a very narrow subset of people with mild everyday symptoms weeks after COVID who attribute them to long COVID without a doctor's diagnosis, rightly or wrongly."
6407,I'll let you know if it ever happens.
6408,Man I go through about 20 pairs of gloves a day.
6409,That's when I know it's over.
6410,Did you read the article?
6411,"Can we at least get a national holiday to remind us of all this shit in the future, to hopefully keep us from letting down our guard for too long (though I guess we’ve barely been on guard as it is)?"
6412,"For us in Ohio, our first “lockdown” started, appropriately enough, on Friday the 13th."
6413,I vote we call this holiday “Quaranteenth”.
6414,I don’t know what the fuck we actually do to mark the occasion other than we don’t go into work and we just drink all day.
6415,Have you not been reading the news?
6416,Tons of people are getting g vaccinated every day and supply is only increasing.
6417,Yes.
6418,That is what the vaccines are supposed to do.
6419,Even after this is over I'm still going to wear a mask and try to work from home as much as possible.
6420,Not having to commute means I've had more sleep this past year than I can ever remember.
6421,I've spent so much less on gas and car insurance that my savings have skyrocketed.
6422,I've only driven about 1000km since June!
6423,"I haven't gotten sick basically all year, and I love it!"
6424,I have to admit I’ve gone to restaurants a few times but only as soon as they open and nobody else is there.
6425,So sick of cutting my own hair though.
6426,Huh are they not considered essential/frontline employees?
6427,That's pretty inexplicable.
6428,The DPA should have been used for PPE starting last year.
6429,What's worse - someone getting money they shouldn't get or people who desperately need money not getting anything ?
6430,"The current state unemployment systems can barely manage as is, why would you want to put a bunch of additional barriers in place?"
6431,"If anything, set aside some money for follow-up investigations and enforcement."
6432,"After that, invest in a system that doesn't suck."
6433,Agreed.
6434,"So far, the message has been, get the vaccine but change nothing."
6435,They have an anti viral they want to focus on
6436,I have the same allergy (it is insanely inconvenient) and agree wholeheartedly with you.
6437,I am really excited that there is a vaccine that I will be able to take though and absolutely don't mind waiting.
6438,Why is Israel still having so many cases then?
6439,"They have vaccinated by far the most in the world at 94.88% of their population, but they just reported 4151 new cases yesterday."
6440,What gives?
6441,Why is the UK seeing so much better results that Israel?
6442,While the UK is only at 31% of its population vaccinated.
6443,"Also if this is true, hoarding more of the vaccine for themselves."
6444,Seriously that is bullshit.
6445,So you want people to start shooting.
6446,Agree.
6447,And...a segment of America (and the world) will keep new behavior patterns.
6448,"Things like:

Shopping online for most / many things and having it delivered (or pick it up)."
6449,"Everyday goods (and food) delivered, leaving more time for things they want to shop for in person

Remote Work - it only takes a small percentage (single digits) to move from the big cities (and many already have) to have an impact (not huge, but still an impact) on economies, voting, traffic, etc."
6450,"Entertainment - many people renovated their homes last year, bought bigger TVs, sound systems, etc."
6451,"They will still go out to the movies, but will be more selective

That said, I am very optimistic that we can finally see the end of this coming and can be safe."
6452,"Yes, it will always be around (we won't eradicate it) but we will be able to go to someone's house and not worry that being inside for 2-3 hours with a group of friends can lead to Aunt Tilly dying."
6453,[removed]
6454,Yeah we all know where the shithole states are
6455,Is it possible those unvaccinated are being more careless now thinking their risk of getting it is lower since so many others have been vaccinated?
6456,They have handled everything so far and will continuebto do so with kid gloves.
6457,People will lie about being vaccinated in order to not wear a mask.
6458,Same reason why we were originally told masks don't work (to limit panic buying and stockpiling).
6459,T2 is both environmental **and** genetic.
6460,Eating *large quantities* of cheap food is a choice.
6461,I’m hoping that’s how we will feel about the variants.
6462,Put your name on the list anyways.
6463,"In the chaos of setting this all up, folks are missing their appointments to get their first dose, and the vaccine has a short shelf life."
6464,Give the vaccination sites a call and see if they have leftovers for the day and see if you can get one.
6465,"When you get the first dose, they automatically get you an appt for a second."
6466,"Plus not for nothing, I hear that they are taking volunteers to be trained to administer the vaccine, and you'll get yours as part of the program."
6467,Contacts vary from place to place.
6468,All I'm saying is that you have options to explore.
6469,"If you want the vaccine (and IMO, you should want it), pretty good chance you can get it if you put in some effort."
6470,Why am I creeped out by Catholics priests who want to tell me what's morally correct?
6471,"T cells don't really prevent infection, but plays a major role in reducing disease severity."
6472,This research is basically saying that even if people are more likely to get infected by the new variants despite vaccine protection (and that is still a big if) they would still get mild courses of illness.
6473,"I still don't think the government absolutely had no choice but to shut the entire province down, I think there are plenty more options."
6474,"Instead of spending billion's on benefits for jobless people, put it into ltc homes."
6475,"For example: ltc home staff are tested once every two weeks, increase their budget and test them more, once a week or more!"
6476,That's gonna make a bigger difference.
6477,What I'm saying is that there is a real risk either way.
6478,Maybe a resistant variant will arise among the unvaccinated once-infected because we moved too slowly and methodically to stem the spread.
6479,It's tempting to frame this as a values choice of saving thousands of lives versus guarding against a potential global risk to millions.
6480,"If it's a values choice then we all get to weigh in, and how great is that?"
6481,But I'm not sure that this is the calculation we're facing.
6482,I know.
6483,Facts are so boring.
6484,Why would you not encourage people to get a vaccine?
6485,"Just because you don't necessarily agree with the mask, saying get a vaccine isn't a surprise."
6486,I think that's what he did say?
6487,It's how I interpreted it.
6488,"Anyway whether or not vaccinated people can spread the virus is probably going to be a moot point by summer when everyone who wants to can get vaccinated and get individual protection, because the thing people are going to care about is lowering health risks, not eliminating COVID transmissions."
6489,Most people only care about COVID transmissions right now because there are a bunch of people who don't have access to protective vaccines yet.
6490,No I didn’t.
6491,Not my job to indulge someone else’s crazy.
6492,"That’s the job of their family, friends and therapists."
6493,"Alternatively, they should just stay home if they are that terrified of going to a beach."
6494,The media / journalists just want divide to get clicks.
6495,It’s sad.
6496,Bahaha

6542,All people I personally know who work from home have only said they feel awful for people who can't do it and would never be such an ass when they know how expensive delivery is.
6543,It seems like just another attempt to stereotype an entire group of people and promote anger and divisiveness.

6545,In so many spheres.
6546,In fact I often question whether the person making these statements is even legit.

6569,"In fact, their tax revenues suggest that a large portion of businesses are thriving."
6570,You are pretty wrong here.
6571,"Well, minus the definition."
6572,"A food desert is a section of a city that does not have easy access to a grocery store, generally defined as having no grocery within a mile (because many studies have found that people are willing to walk up to a mile for necessities."
6573,"The reason this can cause serious medical harm, and why many city planners want to fix this problem, is that most of these food deserts are in impoverished areas where access to reliable transportation is less ubiquitous, so often these areas rely on the small corner stores/groceries for a large portion of their nutritional needs, stores that generally only carry a small selection of foods with a majority of it being pre-prepped and nonparishable items, with few fruits and almost no vegetables."

83k active cases in Jan, now 38k

Peak of 77 daily deaths in Jan, now at 21 daily"
6583,I think its hard to predict what the public will do.
6584,We aren't in a totalitarian society where everything is monitored and everyone will do the best for each other.
6585,Experts also don't want to be wrong so they are cautious.
6586,"Hell I'm a little pissed that Fauci said masks don't help at the start of the pandemic instead of saying ""Masks do help but for the safety of the healthcare workers we need to keep the n-95 for medical people""."

6616,It's less just for the person and more for both the person and the benefit of the masses.
6617,"A huge benefit would be reducing lost productive days, helping the economy survive a bit better."
6618,Every scientist and engineer will tell you 10000% the earth is spherical; that it orbits the sun; that viruses are a mix of genetic material and a membrane; and plenty of other things.
6619,"There are many questions, like the efficacy of a vaccine, the likelihood that we see Betelgeuse go supernova, etc., that really cannot be answered in absolutes simply because we just don’t know — we have to make guesses because we lack empirical evidence of a clear law of nature to help us predict the outcome with any high degree of confidence."
6620,Not super close
6621,Right- I subtracted incorrectly- correcting it in original
6622,"Questioning is good, but just don’t do it with a tone that you know better."

6624,Just a proper mask is a massive improvement.
6625,You’re literally blocking off your two direct paths to the lungs and half your mucus membrains
6626,The reason that the vaccine got out the door so fast was because they didn't do the studies that would usually inform such guidance.

6637,"It might not be fine if there is a substantial surge due to the UK variant due to a higher R number, if this happens in the next few weeks before vaccinations plus natural immunity are able to curb case numbers overall."
6638,"&gt;If someone wants to lie about their status and risk their life, that's on them, both legally and morally."

&gt;A coalition of health and tech companies, which includes Microsoft, Salesforce, and Oracle, is working on an initiative that aims to make it easier for people to access their COVID-19 vaccination records digitally."
6641,"As people are beginning to get vaccinated against COVID-19, they may need to prove that they’re vaccinated so that they can return to work, school, or to travel, and having an easily accessible digital vaccination record could help with that."
6642,The coalition is calling itself the [Vaccination Credential Initiative (VCI)](https://www.vaccinationcredential.org/).

&gt;But if someone lies and tells me they've been vaccinated when they actually haven't so they can come to the party, why should I care?"
6647,all that matters is if hospitals get busy - you don't have to know them to be put back in lockdown.
6648,Probably
6649,This should be the most liked comment in reddit history.
6650,I understand why people want to go back to normal but to be completely honest I don't understand how anyone is comfortable doing so.
6651,I've spent the vast majority of the past year at home and I'm getting ready to spend the next year at home too.
6652,I'm afraid that the second I let my guard down is when I'm gonna get it and possibly spread it to my family.
6653,I wear a kn95 to pick up postmates.
6654,I sanitize my packages before opening them.
6655,I wash my hands to the point of completely drying them out.
6656,I'm still terrified of covid and I'm not even high risk or anything.
6657,It should be buying vaccines to both standards.
6658,"With individual countries having the choice of not using the vaccines which had only passed ""emergency approval"" if they didn't want to."
6659,"Yeah, it's not the religion thing for me."
6660,"Maybe I'm wrong here, but it just seems more stable to get married right after having children or ideally before so we have a higher chance of both parents being present for the child's life."
6661,Sorry for not reading that.
6662,Same man.
6663,But you saved lives for the past year and now we can appreciate how awesome life will be after the pandemic.
6664,I’m never taking it for granted again.
6665,Even 50% is good since deaths and infections are halved
6666,"The 7 day average for doses in the US is now 1,942,788."
6667,So close to 2 million...
6668,My aspirations are much simpler.
6669,"I just want to get to the point where I'm not worried that walking into a store isn't taking my life in hands, where I'm weighing the competing risks of going to the dentist versus getting sick."
6670,You still don't get it.
6671,Take care.
6672,It would be nice if she quantified the risk of there being another wave.
6673,Like is there a 10% chance or a 90% chance.
6674,"It’s all speculation anyway, but at least it’s expert speculation."
6675,I'm guessing you have no concept of the money and time involved in getting the enormous machine that is a Broadway show live.
6676,"It's only fringe scientists saying by fall we can fully resume pre-pandemic activities by fall, a vast majority are taking much more cautious approach."
6677,"On the spectrum of activities to resume, Broadway is on the extremely cautious end."
6678,"Rehearsals take months for new shows, do you expect the actors and crew to return to work before ""herd immunity""?"
6679,"Even returning shows will need a lot of time to prep, there will be cast changes."
6680,It is really hard to compare COVID approaches and results across states.
6681,Just too many variables.
6682,"For instance, does the heat and humidity of Florida suppress the virus in a way that skews Florida's status and outlook?"
6683,"Factor in age and demographics differences, political differences, etc and it becomes even harder."
6684,"&amp;#x200B;

Edited to replace ""countries"" with ""states"""
6685,The problem is that there are enough of them that we might not reach enough uptake for herd immunity
6686,It's actually 1.7 million.
6687,That means the 7 day average will be right around 1.94 million.
6688,They’re just trying to scare people into not preemptively letting their guard down.
6689,Just ignore it and stay cautious until you’re vaccinated.
6690,It’s rube fodder.
6691,"Nah, they're not cherry picking."
6692,That's been the tone this whole time.
6693,"no, 1st wave peaked in august and now kinda still 2nd wave is rising form end of november"
6694,"Started reading again, caught up on plenty of movies and television, learned to cook and bake well, took care of myself a bit more overall."
6695,Thanks for putting some positivity out in what was a very dark time for many!
6696,You lost me when you compared a newly introduced mRNA vaccine (that is openly still being learned about from the very medical community you worship) to a mechanic changing a flat tire lmfao
6697,humidity in FL plays a big factor in cutting down on spread.
6698,Then the claim that it is fine as long as case numbers fall is a bit hasty?
6699,There is more to it than that.
6700,"We can have a total R less than 1 for all variants, but still have R \&gt; 1 for B117."
6701,In that case we are in for a spike unless anything changes.
6702,Are you saying that covid hysteria doesnt cause harm?
6703,Our covid response has caused catastrophic damage.
6704,"Maybe it was worth it, thats the debate."
6705,But its not like one side of this is harmless.
6706,"To the extent that fears were overblown and cost/benefits were distorted, harm was done."
6707,"Maybe you think that extent is 0, but thats a pretty extreme position I think."
6708,Wow.
6709,This should be available to the public before the summer at this rate.
6710,"Once anyone can walk in and get the vaccine (my guess is early summer or late spring), you’ll see the numbers drop even more."
6711,That’s the sweet spot of when things will return to normal.
6712,These vaccines are rolling out super fast now for people in 1B.
6713,I think Florida also only reports data on residents.
6714,So all those snow birds from New York aren’t counting against their metrics
6715,"excerpt:

 An independent data and safety monitoring board (DSMB) met on Feb. 25, 2021 for the second planned interim analysis of the trial data and determined that while the convalescent plasma intervention caused no harm, it was unlikely to benefit this group of patients."
6716,"After the meeting, the DSMB recommended that the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI), part of NIH, stop enrolling new patients into the study."
6717,NHLBI did so immediately.
6718,I think one reason is the mutations.
6719,If unvaccinated people travel freely they are maximizing the opportunities for covid to mutate and create more deadly versions potentially.
6720,If they stay home in their own country we may be able to stamp out covid for good.
6721,Like SARS.
6722,I feel like a ton of states never were not eased up or have been eased up already lol.
6723,"The sun and protons move and relate to matter in extremely predictable ways subject to laws of physics, chemistry, etc."
6724,The “variables” around the sun rising are pretty limited to either black swan-type events or future phases of stellar evolution that humans may not even survive to see.
6725,"So yeah, the sun “may” get hit by a GRB that accelerates or disturbs stable fusion and ultimately leads to the end of the solar system."
6726,The variables around the vaccine and the viruses are not predictable.
6727,There are unforeseen mutations and a butterfly effect at play that can yield many strange permutations.
6728,The “may” in this context — that widespread vaccination may eliminate COVID-19 entirely — is subject to much more likely possibilities than a GRB hitting our sun (or earth).
6729,"We simply don’t even know all the variables, don’t know what the next mutation will look like, how it will affect people, and so on."
6730,TLDR: Not all scientific “mays” are the same.
6731,It’s kinda true.
6732,Add in the 35-40% with naturally acquired immunity and the vaccine rates don’t need to be sky high to dramatically reduce spread.
6733,"Still doesn’t mean they shouldn’t get the jab, but that is part of the benefit of vaccines is that even the unvaccinated get some protection"
6734,Looks like cases are trending downwards again.
6735,"Only ~12,000 new cases so far in the US today and it’s almost 2pm."
6736,"honestly I think these kinds of things - erratic arbitrary restrictions, constant goalpost moving that seems intended to perpetuate lockdowns indefinitely - are fueling conspiracy theories."
6737,"when the actions of leaders make absolutely no sense and can't be justified with a logical explanation, is anyone surprised that people then start to wonder if there might be a hidden agenda going on?"
6738,"&gt;In 70 years, no state's foreign policy will be decided by Covid."
6739,"I don't expect it to be the sole thing, but I think in the future COVID and pandemics will play a much larger role in foreign and domestic policy of **every** state."
6740,I would expect that their spending on pandemics would be much larger than today.
6741,This used to be some hypothetical on the scale of an asteroid hitting the earth.
6742,"It wasn't something taken seriously, let alone serious enough to devote significant resources to fighting it."
6743,Everyone now knows the cost in lives in the economic impact of a pandemic on the modern world.
6744,It's a real threat that countries will be working to stop in the future.
6745,&gt;They fundamentally led to paradigm shifts.
6746,Covid hasn't.
6747,"The very framework of ""normal"" changed."
6748,It hasn't with COVID.
6749,"&gt;...

&gt;The fall of the soviet union and the invention of the hydrogen bomb and Chinese civil war definitely will have longer effects than covid."
6750,I disagree.
6751,"For most of the world that wasn't part of the Soviet Union or in its immediate sphere of influence, it didn't have much impact on daily life (same with the Chinese Civil War)."
6752,"Yeah, there was some Cold War tension, but the fall of the Soviet Union didn't change much in the western world."
6753,"It didn't change how most people worked, how they obtained food, how they educated their children, how they interacted with friends and family."
6754,COVID has done that for everyone everywhere.
6755,"Yes, if you were in an Eastern bloc state, when the Soviet Union fell, that was huge."
6756,"If you were some random person in Kansas, it was an interesting thing you saw on the news and then you went about your day like normal."
6757,COVID effected everyone and how they do everything.
6758,"And I do think it's going to change how the world works together, how they control people moving across borders, how they see emerging health crises in other states as a threat to their own safety."
6759,"Once the large, developed nations vaccinate their own people, they're going to be working with foreign governments to vaccinate their populations as well."
6760,It doesn't do any good to cure all of the US and the UK only for dangerous variants to arise in a less developed country and threaten to put us back into a pandemic.
6761,"There would have been huge blowback to spending billions on foreign health in the past, but I don't expect it to be very contentious at all going forward."
6762,"It's going to change how people work, how people view education, the perception of illness and how it used to be fine to go to your workplace when you were clearly ill or send a sick child to school and now it's seen as a very bad thing."
6763,I think we're going to see big and lasting changes as a result of it.
6764,"No, they may not be as big for an individual directly effected by the things you mentioned, but they're going to be large and lasting changes to how the world works as a whole."
6765,"In short, it might not change a single person's life as much as some of those things did to some specific people, but it's going to change everyone's life a little."
6766,And that makes it a huge historical event.
6767,This is something that will be talked about for generations to come.
6768,"I just got my first dose of the vaccine on Sunday night, and I'm so ready for my second dose in two weeks."
6769,Do we know if the vaccination stops people from spreading it yet?
6770,"I remember that science hadn't been certain yet, and that they had theorized that once you were vaccinated you could no longer be contagious."
6771,I wonder if as more people are getting vaccinated we'll find out.
6772,I'm trying to figure out how to get my parent's shots down there but I'm not even sure how their system is working.
6773,"...I was just making a general comment about the vaccine rollout, and I found it relevant to mention that one of the three vaccines in the US has been approved for teens 16+."
6774,"I knew it was Pfizer, but didn’t think it was relevant to name it."
6775,"Careful, you might reinforce his belief that he's the life of the party."
6776,"If you say ""hey guys, hold on for three more months and its party time."
6777,keep your mask in the closet because we might...might...need them next winter.
6778,"however, we think by memorial day we're more or less done with this."
6779,"we'll play the winter by year but by spring 2022 this is almost certainly in the rearview mirror."""

6783,"&gt; Yes, eating 400 calories worth of chips is not going to **sustain** you as long as 400 calories of almonds."
6784,Sustain is the wrong word.
6785,Satiate is the word you are looking for.
6786,400 calories of anything (ignoring the energy it takes to break down varying macros) will sustain you for the same amount of time.
6787,As for the rest.
6788,"I'm not really sure where the conversation currently is, but the implication that what you eat is irrelevant to obesity is ridiculous."
6789,I don't think most people are fat because they lack an understanding of how calories work.
6790,I think its more to do with them liking calorie dense foods.
6791,"Or not having the knowledge, time and/or inclination to prepare tasty healthy meals."
6792,They probably on some levels understand that Cheeseburgers and French fries and soda get you fat while lettuce and carrots and such will help you lose weight.
6793,They just can't/don't apply that to their life for a myriad of reasons.

6795,Nurse here.. ya get used to it lol
6796,Just a note on the Vaccine hunter facebook groups.
6797,It's predictably a lot of very confused people and not much real advice.
6798,This experience has shown me just how not technology savvy the 70+ crowd is.
6799,They are really struggling with the technology aspects here.
6800,My advice for anyone here is to help your parents book their appointment.
6801,"10 min of efficient google use/phone blitz and I found an appointment for my folks who previously ""couldn't find anything."""
6802,I'm in MN though so it could be different in IL.
6803,Honestly the home store is the only in person store I’ve gone during the pandemic that wasn’t need based.
6804,They’re just so damn big.
6805,The cubic footage of air and airflow is so high that it may as well be outside.
6806,I still wore a kn95 and avoided aisles with people stopped in them though
6807,"Forget Kansas and look at the study I linked that you went all ""it's just influenza"" over."
6808,They cite several studies in several countries and the US that support the assertion that mask requirements (or at least high mask use) prevents infections and deaths.
6809,I would hope these passports don't become a thing until the vast majority of the population has been vaccinated.
6810,Essentially wait one month after vaccine appointment slots start staying open.
6811,Anything else will mean the next pandemic or even a Covid variant will get little buy in from younger people.
6812,"Since atm the vaccine isn't proven to prevent transmission, so they are basically saying ""let the boomers go out because there is little risk of serious illness for themselves"" when the same concept wasn't applied to younger people."
6813,"But the US did not do the two weeks, although what was done slowed things down."
6814,A large percentage of people have not followed guidelines and that’s why we’ve all been paying the price.
6815,I don’t recall them saying herd immunity.
6816,"Not arguing it, I just have not seen inconsistencies from the top people, especially once you know who got out of the way."
6817,No kidding.
6818,"When I worked in restaurants, hardly anyone washed their hands after bringing dirty glasses and plates to dish."
6819,Then they walked right up to the line to grab more freshly plated food to bring to tables....
6820,This is so embarrassing lmao
6821,"I’m just a person on the internet, not qualified to make that conclusion from the data."
6822,I do agree with the premise though.
6823,"You say that, but r/The_Mueller still exists."
6824,&gt;I got down from 205 to 165 today.
6825,40 pounds is a lot of weight to lose in one day.
6826,Iam 5 days in after being tested positive for COVID it’s important to document discuss analyse and record COVID as it happens the more we understand the better prepared we can be in the future so far touch wood but I wouldn’t with this on anyone.

6828,"I just want to show my small children that there is life outside of daycare, home, and the park :(

They don't even remember what a grocery store is."
6829,"Covid will be around for 100 years, so you’d be wearing a mask for the rest of your life if that is your standard."
6830,I think that masks will stop being required once every adult has been offered the vaccine and had time for immunity to take effect.
6831,And they will fade as we just get used to not seeing them as people become more comfortable.
6832,I highly doubt you’ll see a mask commonly in 2022 outside of specific medical facilities or nursing homes.

6844,"Yeah, if only because they take $$$$$ and months to plan, and everyone backing them is very risk averse."
6845,But restrictions put in place by the gov need to be GONE
6846,"It is theoretically possible that a vaccinated person get infected despite vaccine protection, have enough antibodies to prevent most or all symptoms, but still have enough viral replication to be infectious to others."
6847,"We don't have any case studies where this actually happened, and based on what we know about immunology, these cases should be quite rare - we would expect the vaccines to cut a person's odds of infecting another person by 90%, possibly closer to 99%."
6848,"If two people are both fully vaccinated, they should be safe to be with each other, if only one of them is vaccinated, they might want to do some precautions (meet outdoors, distanced, and/or masked etc) depending on the risk factors involved."
6849,By then the people that want to be protected will be.

6864,"Only in Australia where we aimed for elimination; if the modelling which predicts viral suppression relies on behavioural change in response to restrictions on gatherings, but no such behaviour change occurs in the majority of the population, then you will never achieve elimination or suppression, and your hospitals will exceed capacity and your excess death rate will skyrocket

It’s probably true that if you only have “medium” compliance, ie, only those who are empathetic and conscientious follow the rules, and there is not an authority enforcing them, then there is unlikely to be a large reduction in cases; but no leader is going to ethically say “well, a lot of you will die, but you’re just not worth it”."
6865,"Oh actually yeah I guess there are a few monsters who have said that 

Unfortunately there are no guarantees either, places which have done mostly effective lockdowns like Singapore suddenly failed when they lifted too quickly without proper management, and there is definitely an element of randomness with the mutations too"
6866,"America has its share of anti vaxxers, but surprisingly it is less anti-vax than all European nations."

6914,It's kind of like HIV the virus and the resulting disease AIDS.
6915,At this point virologists don't know what level of viral activity is needed to exhibit symptoms.
6916,"And they still don't know with certainty that those with full vaccinations are completely protected from infection, so they don't end up as asymptomatic carriers."
6917,Where it gets tricky is the vaccines with lower efficacy like J&amp;J's.
6918,"Some of those who've taken the shot may still get infected but not have symptoms, or very mild cold-like/allergy-like symptoms."
6919,Whether they're still contagious or not with very mild infections is the big unknown.
6920,"Unfortunately, because there's not a silver bullet therapy for covid yet, you can't experiment by infecting ppl with live virii, so they have to do observational studies which takes months and involves literally hundreds of thousands of ppl."
6921,"Holy shit, that dude is unhinged."

6924,"Why is this tagged ""good news""?"
6925,Twitter being the arbiter of what constitutes misinformation isn't good news.
6926,"Is something like ""Lockdowns didn't work, and Florida got it right"" misinformation?"
6927,"Seems like one man's opinion, but I can see it prompting a ban."
6928,I don’t know what  “ viral interference “ is .
6929,The article suggests that social isolation played a key role.

6931,How are vaccine passports more controlling?
6932,If anything it's less controlling because you at least have the option to travel or stay home.
6933,If the vaccine passports don't roll out then we're completely tied
6934,"I mean, there are some, but I agree."
6935,"This is really just confirmation of a highly suspected feature, but it is always nice to see it documented with proper controls."
6936,I LOVE that series
6937,"It may not die, but it will likely (HOPEFULLY) not show up on r/all anymore."
6938,"God, I hate this type of comment."
6939,"Why spend any amount of time worrying about who is ""signaling"" with their mask wearing?"
6940,"Some folks just keep it on all the time because they don't want to touch their face, or even because they just don't mind it that much and it's easier to leave it on."
6941,Others are high-risk or live with high-risk individuals and just feel safer leaving it on.
6942,What difference does it make to you?
6943,"Personally, I like to pull mine down if I'm outside and safely away from people, but that's my personal choice."
6944,Why would I mind if others choose to keep wearing it?
6945,"I'd rather have people wear it when they don't necessarily need to, than have people not wear it when they should."
6946,It’s been a year of “two weeks to flatten the curve!” It’s time.
6947,You're still not getting it.
6948,I have said about 5 times now that I understand masks are effective at limiting the spread of Covid-19 individually at any given moment in time.
6949,"Again, I will point out the study that you cited listed counties in Kansas that implemented mask mandates and counties that did not."
6950,Counties that implemented them *performed worse than average* in terms of deaths per million.
6951,"You can *say* it's important to try to limit the smaller vectors of spread, but when it has no measurable benefit on the population, why would you?"
6952,"If county A requires masks and 1000 people per million die, and county B doesn't require them and 1000 people per million die, does it matter that ""the studies"" show that masks are effective?"
6953,Real world data shows it didn't have a long term effect.
6954,Dude I’ve agreed that there are possibilities out there.
6955,What’s the issue?
6956,You don’t want to enroll your kids in a trial fine.
6957,You want to wait on vaccinations results?
6958,whatever.
6959,If something were to get through you’re kids chances of getting really sick are so small.
6960,"Yes, it’s a big deal for you but think of every child and parent."
6961,Isn’t it nice to know that you and other parents can be relieved that the chances of them getting really sick from Covid is almost non existent  statistically.
6962,You take chances all the time.
6963,I’m sure you drive and are careful but you could get into an accident.
6964,Things happen.
6965,Also cherry picking parts of my statement as opposed to reading it as a whole is kinda shitty.
6966,There’s a chance but it’s minimal.
6967,You telling me /r/apocalympics2016 isn’t an active sub?
6968,"Nope, you're not missing anything."
6969,"Just that ""the news"" spread misinformation that covid vaccines may not prevent spread."
6970,"Unrelated to the article, but is that the hot dog place from nathan for you?"
6971,Most people I know don't like being guinea pigs.
6972,Would you test a vaccine with 50% efficacy?
6973,75%?
6974,Vaccines are very rarely 100% effective at preventing illness or contagiousness.
6975,But that doesn’t mean that a very large reduction in illness and contagiousness doesn’t effectively end a pandemic either way.
6976,"If a vaccinated person can spread it, but rarely, this drops reproduction values and stops the spread when viewed at a community level."
6977,At an individual level there could still be spread.
6978,I thought America was a third world shithole that was imploding because of covid?
6979,Don’t we deserve them?
6980,I agree 100% however there’s a difference between being informed- as you’re advocating- and crafting headlines solely to generate some panic and clicks.
6981,It’s only when you scroll deeper into these articles that you’ll often find admissions that things will likely continue to trend positively in spite of the variants.
6982,"Again, doesn’t generate quite the same clicks/concern"
6983,How many vaccines against any kind of illness that don't stop spread?
6984,"Fact is, this news isn't surprising, at all."
6985,This is also the de facto reality elsewhere.
6986,"Amarillo, Texas is freely vaccinating anyone who walks in the door with only a token effort to enforce the state-imposed restrictions."
6987,"The county official in charge has said ""we aren't turning anyone away."""
6988,And I bet Amarillo's not the only place like that.
6989,I just want to take my daughter to places.
6990,"Museums at Balboa Park, walk around Parts of San Diego."
6991,Visit both sets of grandparents freely.

6994,Since you deleted your comment below.
6995,I don't believe I mentioned anything regarding cost.
6996,"I'm saying if you're eating ""healthy"" foods, calorie counts will take care of themselves."
6997,"You said this:

&gt;it's almost all about how much you're eating rather than what you're eating."
6998,Like it's some kind of either or.
6999,Or what you eat is almost completely irrelevant to the conversation.
7000,"But if you're eating a bunch of fresh fruits and veggies, plant based proteins, and whole grains, the ""how much you eat"" part will take care of itself."
7001,What you eat matters.
7002,Because of evolution humans have an incredibly strong urge to eat too much when they are eating the wrong things.
7003,Our bodies did not adapt to these calorie bombs so people still feel the urge to eat.
7004,I guess what I'm saying is Calorie counting will be far easier if you're consuming the right stuff rather than McDonald's.
7005,"Surez theoretically, you can lose weight on McDonald's, but people won't because it requires insane will power to do it."
7006,"Kids don't die from it at nearly the same rate, nor do they seem to transmit it to adults."
7007,Hence why the CDC says teachers can go back to work.
7008,"I bet you run marathons and have 3 phds because you are just perfect and self improvement always pays off, and hey who doesn't benefit from knowing how to perform a tracheotemy"
7009,I don't know what is happening but the variants are starting to dominate and kids are expected to go to schools where a class will only be closed until 3 cases are confirmed.

7013,Communication takes a decent hit with masks.

It's been approved - remember?"
7024,"It's not ""experimental""."
7025,And might I direct your attention to how the government got around the constitution where it comes to the rights of sex offenders?
7026,There's no problem what so ever in treating individuals as if they have no rights as long as it's for the good of the whole.

7038,Trump couldn't even get a deal to purchase enough vaccine from a manufacturer.
7039,"He literally just had to throw money at something and make a purchase, and was too inept/lazy/incompetent/evil to do even that."
7040,Good fucking riddance!
7041,"We don't know that, I wouldn't prematurely jump to conclusions."
7042,"The reason why obese people would need more vaccine isn't because their bodies are bigger in relationship to the vaccine volume, it's because of their immune system being weaker and obese people experiencing constant inflammation which renders them more vulnerable to diseases."
7043,"Not because they have bigger organs

I don't think a high lung surface area directly causes heavier viral infection either, that doesn't make any sense."
7044,"With that logic you could even say that skinnier people would have more problems because a higher percentage of their longues would get infected with the same amount of virions, which would lead to a lower oxygen saturation of the blood."
7045,But this is not the case

7065,This makes me mad that comic con and E3 got canceled again.
7066,Yeah man I'm just disgusted with the treatment of obesity in our nation.
7067,It's our number one cause of death IIRC and it really seems like no one has the right solution to take care of it.
7068,I gained like 15-20 pounds (I was 195 6'0) before last summer started and I felt absolutely disgusting.
7069,I have no clue how people can live at 250-300+
7070,"I’m thinking there could be a fourth wave but it’ll be nowhere near as serious as anything we experienced last year, with the vaccines on the horizon and hospitals knowing more about how to treat this thing."
7071,I don't think it's a conspiracy.
7072,I don't think all the corporate CEOs get together and plan things out.
7073,I don't think the situation we're in today happened on purpose.
7074,I think it's just how our culture has evolved for things to work.
7075,"They're all doing it independently because it's what works best for them, the way water flows downhill."
7076,And there's no big mystical reason for why they're doing it.
7077,"It's money, pure and simple."
7078,"They have money, and they are afraid of losing their access to it."
7079,"Let's take universal healthcare, for instance."
7080,We have a whole industry based on health insurance.
7081,We have no idea what will happen to that industry if we implement universal healthcare.
7082,Probably nothing good.
7083,The whole point of universal healthcare is to get rid of the profit happening in between the doctors and hospitals and their patients.
7084,But it's not just the insurance industry that will suffer.
7085,"All employers stand to lose a huge advantage in the employer-employee balance, here."
7086,"Right now, employers are one of the only viable way for your average Joe to get healthcare."
7087,There are many many workers out there who will leave their jobs to retire early or pursue something independent if they didn't have to rely on their employers to provide health insurance.
7088,So of course the people who are profiting from the way healthcare works today don't want universal healthcare.
7089,"They lobby politicians (and by ""lobby"", I mean spend vast amounts of wealth on) to keep universal healthcare from being an option."
7090,Those politicians are now motivated to make their constituents think universal healthcare is bad.
7091,They also spend money to influence news stories that make universal healthcare sound bad.
7092,They fund studies and only publish the ones that make universal healthcare sound bad.
7093,This is a far cry from vaccines causing autism or mind control.

7111,That don’t vaccinate anyone and we all go to government run facilities to get our flu shot every year.
7112,You literally don’t know what you’re talking about.
7113,I’ll say 50% capacity should be the limit right now.
7114,"And maybe in a few weeks or so, we can bump it up to 75%, or even reopen fully."
7115,"At best this becomes an annual nuisance we can manage with yearly shots, like the flu."
7116,I believe they are currently testing trials for 16+.
7117,They have difficulties finding younger volunteers apparently.

7119,Is this comment suggesting that policy and science **are** guided by u/dawk1001's feels?
7120,"as much as i trust the vaccine, you legally can't force people to take an experimental vaccine."
7121,the vaccine is still considered experimental.
7122,you're suggesting that we perform human experiments on criminals
7123,At the moment.
7124,This thing ain't leaving soon
7125,Depends on the state of course.
7126,States with large airports seem to be more accommodating.
7127,"The issue with that is due to the work schedule, a lot of pilots live in different states from the airports they fly out of."
7128,"If you are gone for 3-7 days and staying in hotels, the initial length of the commute to work doesn’t matter as much."
7129,It would not surprise me if the people making these vaccination categories didn’t know that however.
7130,"Due to my job I’m pretty anti lockdown but I’d get a shot, and will get one when I can."
7131,I just laugh at them punishing the public with hotel stays and testing requirements and not plugging the very clear hole in the international quarantines.
7132,"In October, I moved to a house like 1.5 blocks from a pizzeria/bar."
7133,"I don't usually go to bars, but part of me can't wait to sit at this bar with a cocktail and a fresh slice."
7134,Maybe some fresh spinach artichoke dip.
7135,Makes sense.
7136,"DC will continue to prioritize inoculating America (the American general public citizens) above all else before exporting their homegrown, domestically produced and American-made vaccines made in USA to other countries once the U.S. reached herd immunity."
7137,"Maybe I’m too optimistic, but I don’t think so."
7138,"Assuming vaccines continue to roll out, we should be on track to start opening up more."
7139,I don’t recall experts ever saying “just 2-3 more months” in the past.
7140,The longer the spread of the virus remains uncontrolled the higher the odds are that a variant will pop up that the current generation of vaccines will not work on.
7141,"So unfortunately, yes..."
7142,If there remains a large portion of the population who refuses to get vaccinated it will put us all at risk.
7143,Ahh ok. My mistake.
7144,Do you happen to know what the current transmission rate is?
7145,Or where I can find it?
7146,I would verify that its okay for you to even mix the vaccines.
7147,I havent heard any word if its okay or not
7148,And my point is that’s a false dichotomy.
7149,"If the concern was over N95s and surgical masks, then you buy them up like the government was already doing and you tell everyone else to wear a piece of cloth at the very least."
7150,You don’t sacrifice one group of people for another when the easiest solution is just to tell the truth.
7151,I don’t think we’ll ever agree here so I’m bowing out.
7152,I’m glad that part of the pandemic is behind us but I stand by the statement that Fauci and the CDC let a lot of people die unnecessarily by purposely lying to us and we shouldn’t be so forgiving of that.
7153,Someday those people might be your or your loved ones.
7154,You might have a different stance then.
7155,"If you’re in the US, you’re gonna get one or at least be eligible before summer."
7156,"It will be interesting to see how the world progresses in summer with a vaccinated US and UK, laggard and vaccine skeptical EU but they’ll still be pretty vaccinated, and then mostly unvaccinated developing world."
7157,"Right, I get that, which is why I asked if they've shown efficacy at 4 months."
7158,It'd suck to use all these valuable doses and find out that at 4 months you have reduced efficacy for whatever reason.
7159,I think I've read that covid antibodies only stay present in your body for 7-9(?)
7160,"months, which is how some people have caught it twice."
7161,I can't google to verify as I'm at work.
7162,"In the end it doesn't matter, I'm gonna continue to mask up and distance until 2022 probably."
7163,I wish we'd adopt masking as a regular practice even for things like a cold.
7164,Japan and other Asian countries really do have that part right.
7165,US has plenty of water
7166,Not at all
7167,"yes, this isn't a news story."
7168,we already knew that it reduces spread a lot
7169,I heard yesterday Gavin Newsom is offering $2billion to school districts if they will re-open?

7187,Chain pharmacies are literally designed to be local pharmacies and don't have extra staff hanging around to do an entirely different job all day every day for months.
7188,Do you expect everyone to stop taking their prescription medication for ~6 months so CVS and Walgreens can distribute vaccines?
7189,Not concerned

7197,I have 2 personal examples that were nearly not reported (1 wasn't).
7198,1: Me.
7199,My wife had covid over xmas.
7200,She went to the clinic for a cocktail shot thinking she had a cold and tested positive.
7201,Her doctor wanted me to come get tested so I obliged.
7202,I tested negative on the rapid but they drew blood and sent it off.
7203,Turns out I had the antibodies so I had already had it.
7204,"Had she not gone to the clinic, I would never have been tested."
7205,2: A friend of mine still hasn't been tested and had it a month or so ago.
7206,Mild symptoms that could have been a cold but the big indicator is he had absolutely no sense of smell or taste for nearly 3 weeks.
7207,He never got tested because he never felt sick beyond the mild cold but it's pretty obvious he had it.
7208,He did his quarantine and whatnot and returned to life as normal (other than smell/taste) after a couple of weeks and a few days without the cold symptoms.
7209,"I guess the ""almost"" comes from the article below."
7210,The slovenian doctor was vaccinated (2 doses) and even went to work the next day after coming back from Africa because he thought he was immune and thus infected coworkers.

7216,"The term ‘food desert’ is not so much that there is zero access to food, it is normally used to describe a situation where the easiest and most prevalent food is junk food and balanced, healthy options are uncommon."
7217,"It doesn’t mean that people never take a bus out to a supermarket outside the neighborhood, it just means that the most accessible options are not sufficient to build a balanced/healthy diet around."
7218,"In general, people will default to choices that are convenient over time consuming alternatives, so the food options within a small range within a neighborhood are an important consideration, even if (as is common) residents are not solely reliant on food purchased from small corner stores."

7232,I woke this morning with a 100 degree fever.
7233,"Getting a rapid test now, wish me luck!"
7234,"Youre right, the actual stat of people who have received at least one dose is 55% for Israel and 30% for UK."
7235,"However, even at 55% I'd expect Israel to be getting less cases if the premise of the article holds true for both countries relatively similarly."
7236,"Not only did California not lock its residents in a house, but there were categorically worse off states."

7240,"It's day 10 after my pfizer vaccine and supposedly protection starts being generated right about now, so I'm stoked!"
7241,I could wear a mask all the live long day.

7243,"They're a reminder of all the things we can't have now, things we have no control of getting back."
7244,"Damm, check out their profile."

7246,Thank you!!
7247,Your positivity really helps.
7248,"Remember, most people who are out and about and keeping case numbers up still won't be vaccinated for at least a month or two, and likely longer."
7249,It'll take some time before case numbers drop significantly.
7250,Not anymore.
7251,"That's been the bottleneck, but we're hitting the point now where supply is exploding and by the start of April we're going to be producing enough for at least 3-4x the shots we've been delivering."

7267,"And worst case scenario, they won't need to be placed in an ICU"
7268,I didn’t think you were referring to no vaccination but instead waiting until trials are done.
7269,You can try to keep your kids as safe as possible but the world is out there.

7271,Things happen but kids at this point are the least of anyone’s worries because of their strong and fast recovery.

7319,You are right about that!
7320,It seems that all senior citizens I know have had at least one shot.

7325,"The UK and EU did this, as did a bunch of other countries/entities."
7326,"Approval for AZ in EU was based on trials performed in UK, SA, and Brazil."
7327,Approval for Pfizer in the UK was based on trials in US and Germany.
7328,Approvals for Moderna in the EU were based on trials done entirely in the US.
7329,This is an FDA requirement in the US and is mainly just blocking distribution of AZ vaccines (and soon Novavax as well).
7330,"The US getting a large and steady supply of vaccines coming in from Pfizer and Moderna and soon also J&amp;J which all did early phase 3 trials in the US made it possible to maintain its high barriers for approval of AZ and Novavax, but I suspect the FDA would have waived these requirements to approve AZ in January if either a) the data from their phase 3 trials had fewer errors and showed higher efficacy or b) the Pfizer and Moderna trials hadn't finished so early and gone so spectacularly well."
7331,it's important to be aware that numbers &amp; trends can change.
7332,"The public would be just as upset if the mere mention of strains was minimized as case numbers started escalating, while state health rules were relaxed &amp; kids brought back into class."
7333,It's important with big policy changes like re-opening in-class learning &amp; indoor dining that the public weigh the pros &amp; cons.
7334,Being informed is never a bad thing.
7335,It's really a terrible article with a nice headline.
7336,At the start /r/china_flu was the rational subreddit and this one was the crazy conspiracy one.
7337,Now its reverse lol
7338,"https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/usa/new-york/

Deaths in New York in December/January were 1/5th of what they were in March."
7339,Covid was clearly worse in March in New York - there just wasn't enough testing.
7340,It's ridiculous at this point to be worried about cases/capita when all evidence supports that we were and are continuing to vastly undercount them.
7341,"Deaths/capita is the best metric to understand the overall spread of Covid in a community, but you are right that there are contributing factors."
7342,"Either way, it is *a fact* that Oklahoma allowed their citizens freedom *and* you were about half as likely to die of Covid in Oklahoma than New York."
7343,"That, to me, seems like a major win in terms of Covid, but hey, maybe some people like living under restrictions and being more likely to die."
7344,To each their own I guess.
7345,"Sticking to the current dose schedule is certainly the safe bet, from the perspective of ""ensuring as many people as possible achieve as high a degree of immunity as possible."""
7346,"But it would be incorrect to say that increasing the dosing interval would be a decision ""not based in science."""
7347,There is a good amount of evidence that a single dose of Pfizer or Moderna has a strong protective effect.
7348,"The real question is whether the second dose is necessary, and if delaying it will have an effect."
7349,I'm not qualified to comment on that directly.
7350,The people I've spoken to with immunological expertise have said it would be surprising to find that it made much of a difference.
7351,"Given the potential upside and lack of any obvious disqualifies, it'd be nice to see a more rigorous analysis of this plan."

7357,These things are not mutually exclusive
7358,Yeah 27 is about the average BMI of an American
7359,It's not the worst thing for small amounts of time but working with a mask on for hours on end can be fucking awful.
7360,Especially if you're sweating or your nose is running.
7361,"I know there were a lot of bad faith arguments made by chuds, and obviously wearing a mask is important/worth it but that doesn't change the fact that masks can be super uncomfortable and unpleasant."
7362,Hi- what’s that documentary if you don’t mind?
7363,It sounds interesting.
7364,My out-of-pocket maximum is set by my insurance.
7365,as far as I'm concerned money out of my pocket for my health goes to the same place.
7366,Once I've met the maximum the insurance company pays anyway.
7367,Yesterday was a little lower than the previous monday.
7368,"On our worst days we may see 75k cases instead of 80, but personally don't see a big change coming this week."
7369,"The concern isn't that antivaxxers will get it, it's that antivaxxers will keep it corculating and mutating in the population."
7370,Even if vaccines are 95% efficient that still leaves a small chance of getting infected.
7371,So there's a world of difference between the virus being eradicated and having it circulate among the antivaxxers - especially for people in the high risk groups.
7372,Isn't that the purpose of a vaccine?
7373,"In my city (Atlanta), buses are not a reliable form of transportation."
7374,"They tend to not be on schedule, are inconsistent, and have limited routes for specific areas."
7375,"There is also the issue that taking the bus carries a large time investment, which low income families/marginalized groups do not have the luxury of."
7376,Infrastructure in the majority of US cities is largely based on owning a car.
7377,Any option besides traveling by car is underfunded or not a reliable option.
7378,Recognizing that there are limitations that people face to accessing nutritious foods allows for communities to address these lack of resources.
7379,"&gt;Well in the past year the world basically completely shat on the US's Covid-19 response

7390,I just want to go outside without the mental fatigue that I might catch the virus.

7392,If you filled Japan with Spaniards or Americans it would be catastrophic.
7393,That must be incredibly difficult.
7394,I hope your vaccine roll out improves.

7396,Stayed in the Moodisburn hotel - before the revamp.
7397,It was lovey!

7399,It absolutely is our problem.
7400,"If we let the virus rage worldwide, we are sure to get mutations that render the vaccine less effective eventually."
7401,Meaning potential for another pandemic event
7402,I think it's more in-line with other destigmizing movements like destigmitizing mental health issues or addiction issues.
7403,The goal is to not shun or shame people with problems that exacerbate their issues.
7404,"It's also important to decouple value from physical looks, especially for young women where this is an unconscious prejudice that permeates society."
7405,The good part of the body acceptance movement is about letting people know they have value and worth despite their current physical attributes.
7406,It is sometimes misinterpreted as encouraging people to stay unhealthy.
7407,"But, using the addiction analogy, addicts do far better with a message: ""We love you."
7408,"We see that you have an illness and we want you to get better,"" than the message: ""You are worthless and useless and society would rather you just disappear."""
7409,"For a teen girl to hear ""We love you."

7411,"is a very important message since most ads, movies and popular culture gestalt says the exact opposite."
7412,"Unfortunately just like other complex issues, the loudest and stupidest people often have the biggest say in how the public receives them."
7413,"Yes, but going to need a very high percentage of people to take them to have the effects we want."
7414,Just look at Israel still without a significant decline in cases and hospitalizations.
7415,Don't think it's going to happen in the US for example.
7416,California is crushing the vaccine rollout.
7417,"We're almost there, hang tight."
7418,but are they equally responsible?
7419,Sure.
7420,Never said I would be a jerk to folks not wearing a mask.

7432,Most vaccines have a much longer period between shots.
7433,"Shingrix, for example, requires a second dose that can be given as long as six months after the first."
7434,Doses are close together for COVID vaccines because the trials were condensed.
7435,Your second corroborating study talks about individual effectiveness of masks for influenza - I didn't think it needed to be said that that study has no bearing on **population effectiveness of mask mandates** for Covid-19.
7436,"To reiterate my main point so that it doesn't seem like I'm saying masks don't work - individually, when worn properly, it is very clear that masks work."
7437,My point is that there really isn't much data supporting that *overarching government mask mandates* have had much effect.
7438,And that seems to be conflicting right?
7439,"But in essence, everything that comes out about how Covid spread - the *vast majority* of spread occurs through prolonged close contact with someone who has the virus."
7440,People have prolonged close contact mostly *without masks*.
7441,"To effectively utilize masks, we should be wearing them *in our homes*."
7442,Wearing a mask to the grocery store decreases your chance of catching Covid a very small amount compared to not having people over to your house.
7443,"So mandating masks at the grocery store has very small effect on overall spread of Covid (again, counties with mask mandates in Kansas averaged 51st out of 105 in deaths per million) when people are just going to meet maskless at people's houses anyways."
7444,Thank you.
7445,"Yeah no one is talking about ""controlling"" others, that is a weird and defensive take."
7446,Why do people trying to justify ignoring public health recommendations automatically jump to saying others are trying to control them?

7448,"I'm saying I think their risk assessment is unwise and leads to unsafe behavior that overall harms their community, not that they should be locked in prison."

7497,"But I'm pretty sure California also enforced covid curfews because we know it only comes out after 9pm because ""science"""
7498,If walgreens is doing Texas I had great luck at 4 AM pacific time.
7499,&gt; We have been constantly monitoring cases/hospitalizations/deaths and the decision was made based on those numbers.
7500,THOSE NUMBERS ARE BASED ON CURRENT RESTRICTIONS.
7501,"Honestly, people who think like that are reactionary morons who can't predict the weather 10 minutes from now."
7502,Went to a bowling alley and bars in Brooklyn last weekend.
7503,Bowling alley was completely packed.
7504,Bars not packed but definitely all the tables were filled.
7505,It says I cannot upload the link twice.
7506,[removed]
7507,"We went from 3,000 deaths a day to 2,000 deaths a day in two weeks, in another two weeks we will be down to 1,000 deaths a day."
7508,Once all of the elderly and at risk are vaccinated deaths will be almost nonexistent.
7509,At this rate we will be there by April.
7510,The idea that we should still be locked down until June is ridiculous.
7511,There is no fourth wave coming if vaccines keep going at this pace.
7512,What data indicates they shouldn't open more?
7513,"If you quarantine for 72 hours, it’s useless."
7514,"The virus has a 2 week incubation period, meaning you could test negative and have no symptoms and still spread it after 72 hours."
7515,"And last time I checked, Australia wasn’t wielding people into their homes like China was, unless you believe that is appropriate?"
7516,Why even bother having groups at that point.
7517,Verify that some 40 year old didn't used to smoke for a year or two 20 years ago.
7518,"So a fourth surge is possible... but schools reopening is fine... as long as it's done ""safely"" and according to guidelines... which didn't include anything about opening a window until this week... and ""safely"" means expenses... and this damn stimulus bill hasn't been passed yet... and Biden hasn't gone on the record to say teachers should be moved into all eligibility groups."
7519,"Before downvoting, I actually think we won't have a fourth surge and this is overblown considering the amount of vaccine doses coming."
7520,But I'm also not the one in charge of the CDC talking out of both sides of my mouth.
7521,"My problem is that if she thinks there might be a fourth surge, then she should tell us why people sitting in a room for up to 4 or 5 hours a day breathing the same air is ""safe"" and will not significantly contribute to that 4th surge."
7522,The primary route of transmission is aerosol.
7523,"I know, I know... kids don't spread it."
7524,Then how come the high school in my town has had several outbreaks primarily among kids doing sports together?
7525,And how come their parents and coaches got it?
7526,We've had more than enough time to pay for real studies on this and never did.
7527,"I'm basically like F your 4th surge, reopening is happening and you're gonna take some of the blame if there is one."
7528,I simply don't even wanna hear it anymore and these are the reasons why.
7529,Nothing serious.
7530,Felt a bit tired and went to sleep super early.
7531,Other than that only a little headache and my arm hurts quite a bit.
7532,Much less than expected.
7533,100% he is pulling this to distract from the energy infrastructure failure in Texas.
7534,Yeehaw I get my 1st shot tomorrow!
7535,Did this dude forget the Great Lakes exist or something?
7536,We have a significant portion of the Earth's unfrozen supply of fresh water right here.
7537,Mental health wellbeing wise all I really need is for most people to be vaccinated by like the 4th of July.
7538,Two months of normal summer outside of like maybe airports or whatever.
7539,"Even June, man."
7540,I'll mask up in June if need-be.
7541,But let's have a good July.
7542,You need to start getting your news from more reliable sources.
7543,I guarantee you that no one who has any kind of expertise in infectious disease told you that this would be over before a vaccine was widely available.
7544,"I find this difficult to believe, after a year of worse and worse news."
7545,"The most diverse American city in terms of people, now the most diverse city in terms of viral strains too."
7546,No.
7547,Run early in the morning to avoid people.
7548,I mean.
7549,They'll deal with it or they'll die.
7550,So...
7551,Which vaccine did you get?
7552,"I got Pfizer dose 1 yesterday and felt a dull pain this morning, no other symptoms."
7553,I really just want to feel comfortable around new people again!
7554,All the vaccines and people dying off and recovering from the holidays have us in a better place.
7555,And the people who don’t want to drink and drive won’t.
7556,Everyone’s happy!
7557,/s
7558,The public just doesn’t understand the cautious language that scientists use as a rule.
7559,A scientist saying “we don’t yet know” gets translated into “it probably doesn’t work.”
7560,Does the distributed number mean shipped or arrived?
7561,An argument which doesn't hold as much water once things calm down.
7562,"They should still get vaccinated, but turning into a surveillance state cannot be the end goal because some anti vaxxers are idiots."
7563,I’m not going to defend Cuomo but I do think there is a difference between having so many deaths because you’re a densely populated early epicenter of the pandemic and willfully causing deaths because you refuse to listen to science.
7564,"Jersey, though.... my friend told me that all the clubs are open there and stuff, so they might be a combination of both, which is how they reach number 1..."
7565,"So people who live in nursing homes and long term care facilities make up well under 1% of the US population, but account for 34-40% of the COVID deaths."
7566,Most of those who didn't die right away are going to have their quality of life seriously diminished.
7567,"People 75 and over are only about 8% of the US population, but are 59% of Covid deaths."
7568,"People 65-74 are 21%, so people over 65 are 80% of Covid deaths."
7569,"Vaccinating the elderly (over 85) will save over 500X as many lives as people in their 20's and about 8,000 times as many lives as vaccinating children."
7570,"If Covid had an even mortality rate, it might make sense to vaccinate the youngest first, but that's not what's happening."
7571,I surely hope you are right.
7572,Some articles purporting to it leading to a permademic of reinfections and defeated vaccines may be baseless but variants are definitely mainstream news.
7573,"I love 40k and I know a few privates that are in the lowest of lows of high school) but I definitely believe in vaccines, that's not the reality we live in a studio."
7574,There is usually one somewhere.
7575,"Not to offend anyone with this but to me, but even slimmer chance that she had 3 kids by the age of playing with Mr. Potatohead have gender identity crises."
7576,Stop the bullshit.
7577,I bet HEB is just going to let up on enforcement.
7578,They probably won't officially allow no masks until most people  already aren't wearing them.
7579,Polio is also effectively eradicated.
7580,&gt;We need to foster a work culture where it is encouraged and acceptable to stay home when you are sick.
7581,One inescapable conclusion from working from home for the last year: anyone coming into the office with obvious signs of illness after this is a straight up asshole.
7582,"Anything we can do in the office, we can do from home."
7583,I will have no trouble telling my coworkers they need to leave when sick.
7584,And for damn sure I’m not coming in if I feel unwell.
7585,Did you read the restrictions of the permits?
7586,"If you arrive from an orange or red zone, you must quarantine:  for red, for two weeks, and for orange, for 72 hours or until you test negative."
7587,"Currently, Australia has effectively eradicated COVID, so the country has all progressed to green, but they are ready to revert at any time."
7588,"(For example, Auckland is currently red - and in lockdown - due to a _single case_ that was detected there.)"
7589,"Of course, we're off in the weeds here."
7590,"Your original statement was:

&gt; New Zealand and Australia did not have the level of lockdowns that China did

And they clearly did, with mandatory quarantines, severe restrictions on public life, and an end result of effectively _eradicating COVID-19_."
7591,The strategy worked.
7592,"I don't usually eat steak but when I do, I cook it myself."
7593,"Yeah, steak isn't something I'd get delivered but most other foods stay heated just fine."
7594,No one who knows anything about viruses was telling you that this would be over before there was a vaccine widely available.
7595,"I think people here need to understand; when people say that Florida has been this way for a while, and people respond that there is still a bit of compliance in Florida, it’s PROBABLY GONNA END UP LIKE THAT HERE TOO."
7596,"Just like in Florida, the case is probably going to be everywhere but urban centers being full normal, with the cities having some masks sometimes."
7597,Like Florida.
7598,According to the cdc the vaccines only prevent symptoms and possibly hospitalization or death.
7599,But DO NOT prevent transmission.
7600,So how could this be true?
7601,Yeah idfk what's going on over there.
7602,Obviously they faired much better than other countries like the US and Brazil.
7603,But their country literally did nothing to stop the spread.
7604,Kept students in schools and workers in the office.
7605,"Waged domestic travel subsidy campaigns while blaming spread on foreigner populations (""this is a pen"" and isolating tracing only to foreigners)."
7606,And their shit testing response.
7607,"I don't think ""they wear masks"" and ""they're healthy"" can completely explain why the most [elderly population in the world](https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2019/09/elderly-oldest-population-world-japan/) had almost zero impact."
7608,"Per [this article](https://mainichi.jp/english/articles/20201012/p2a/00m/0na/013000c), 2020 deaths in Japan decreased by 13,851 compared to 2019."
7609,"The last time they saw a decrease in annual deaths was in 2009, which saw 547 fewer deaths compared to 2008."
7610,That is in *insane* and nearly unexplainable decrease compared to other years.
7611,"Also, [several](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7738637) [articles](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.09.20143164v9) say excess deaths in Japan is down, even though ourworldindata shows a [12 percentage point increase](https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/excess-mortality-p-scores?tab=table&amp;stackMode=absolute&amp;time=earliest..latest&amp;region=World) in excess deaths in Japan from 2020-2021."
7612,Obviously Japan is doing good but they are in no way telling the whole story.
7613,"&gt; Honestly, I feel elated right now, it really is starting to hit me that there is a light at the end of the tunnel."
7614,It’s like a cargo cult.
7615,You think if you have the trappings if success then you are successful.
7616,Like those people who built a fake airport out of like bamboo and stuff and thought the cargo planes would automatically start coming.
7617,thank you swami...can you also let me know what the next gme is?
7618,"“They got me,” Covid said of American's vaccine effort."
7619,"""That fucking America boomed me."""
7620,"Covid added, “Their so good,” repeating it four times."
7621,Covid then said it wanted to add America to the list of countries it'll avoid this summer.
7622,H‑E‑B already rescinded it once.
7623,They’ll do it again for sure
7624,Ready for the next pandemic.
7625,First Bird flu case in a human?
7626,so does this mean that the entire adult population will be fully vaccinated by the end of may
7627,Exactly.
7628,"Everyone should be doing it, I just never even thought about it."
7629,It's all pretty gross to think about.
7630,"French here, can confirm it was totally unreported in France."
7631,That's WAY better than I thought
7632,"Does this mean everyone will be vaccinated with the first dose (for two dose vaccines) by April end, and second dose by May end?"
7633,This right here.
7634,"Even if it wasn't summer, we shouldn't do this."
7635,We don't need to create extensive databases to track this.
7636,"Make people who are travelling internationally provide documentation, but don't turn the country into a surveillant state in the process."
7637,Twice postponed wedding is schedule for June.
7638,LET’S GO!
7639,I already do that
7640,"Did this dude actually make a joke about handling the ""arctic blast""?"
7641,I mean I personally don’t judge people based on the state they live in.
7642,Texas officials looked at the data and reasoned that the risk of opening is worth it for society
7643,[removed]
7644,"So, I have a vaccination appointment for Saturday, but today someone I had close contact with just tested positive."
7645,"Is it still okay for me to get vaccinated, if I potentially already have Covid?"
7646,"I mean, maybe?"
7647,My husband might by then but my daughter almost certainly won't.
7648,"I know she is not highly likely to get COVID under normal situations, but an airplane with a bunch of maskless bozos seems sketch."
7649,"And then to have her out and about once we get there, I am having doubts."
7650,I will just have to see how this plays out over the next few months and then decide.
7651,Obviously cause “Texans have mastered the habits to keep from getting COVID.” (greg abbott)
7652,Fall??
7653,Ahahahaha try July my friend
7654,&gt;It does not seem wise to remove restriction when more than half the population is not even eligible for the vaccine.
7655,"Yes, but we're not talking about now, we're talking about the summer and by then most adults will have access to COVID vaccines."
7656,Congrats US.
7657,You guys are pretty good.
7658,"Sometimes, this gets forgotten in all the noise."
7659,This is a really well executed vaccine rollout.
7660,"Given the population size, it is hands down the best performance by any country in the vaccination effort."
7661,Less pressure in Socal with being able to do outdoor dining
7662,It’ll matter to the people who end up being hospitalized or worse because Texas couldn’t wait for the “immune from vaccination” phase was actually in effect.
7663,"We are past the point where this is necessary though, early on in the pandemic yeah it would have been huge, but with the vaccine rolling out and in the arms of something like 70m people it is unnecessary."
7664,Agree as long as there isn’t some out of no where super variant or something but seems the vaccines all still work enough on the variants or to another’s point politics go and do political things that also
7665,you just made that shit up.
7666,get outta here.
7667,got any stats to back up or should we just take you at your word?
7668,There’s a big underselling of the vaccine going on.
7669,At least in the US.
7670,The messaging is terrible.
7671,"People are being told that you’ll still need to wear a mask, you’ll still need to distance, indoor activities will still be canceled, the virus will still spread, you aren’t protected from variants."
7672,Why take it if it doesn’t change anything?
7673,The public needs to be told that these vaccines are the medical miracle and will be the silver bullet that kills the pandemic.

7680,Not looking forward to hearing about school shootings again...
7681,Depends on the symptoms.
7682,Coughing &amp; sneezing spreads the virus further.
7683,"My issue with masks is I always walk 100 feet away from my car before I remember I need it, then I have to run back and grab my mask."
7684,"Actually went grocery shopping for about 5 minutes the other day before I realized a bunch of people giving me dirty looks, and had to run back to my car."
7685,"Also they make my glasses constantly fogged up, so yah, I fucking hate them."
7686,"I still wear them, but I hate them."
7687,We’ve been doing the math on here for a while now!
7688,This is not something new!
7689,Connecticut stated 2 weeks ago that everyone would be able to schedule an appointment as of  May 2nd
7690,Israel provides clinical data of vaccinated Israelis in exchange for Biontech/Pfizer vaccines.
7691,Pfizer uses the country like a large-scale trial.
7692,Pfizer only needs an agreement with one country for such an arrangement.
7693,"Thus, it's not something other countries could emulate even if they wanted to."
7694,"Looking for vaccines in Florida for my 65+ parents and the counties near them are fully booked while many other counties appointments are still available, which is a little discerning since people who want them can’t access them or there is not enough man power to meet demand."
7695,Hoping they’ll look at allocating based on turn out rate and will help get even more vaccines in arms
7696,Weakening immune systems shouldn’t be encouraged
7697,"Well I’m happy for you, and I’m sure it is a huge weight off your shoulders."
7698,Thank you for getting it done!
7699,👊🏼
7700,"But but we have data on that age range, a shit ton of it in fact."
7701,This makes 0 sense.
7702,You might be underestimating how many people have already had it.
7703,"2.66M Texans are confirmed to have had it, however, the CDC esimates only 1 in 4.6 cases are recorded."
7704,That translates to roughly 42% Texans have had it.
7705,"However, people who have been taking precautions likely will not change their behavior likely under-represent the 42%."
7706,"Add in that 13% of the population have vaccines, it's very possible that the population of people who will change their behavior is near herd immunity."
7707,How much their actions impacts the others is yet to be seen.
7708,ok cool whats your exit plan?
7709,variants will forever be present.
7710,the old folks should assess the risk for themselves.
7711,we gotta be outside
7712,There is also a highly effective flu vaccine.
7713,"This is like a soccer player getting 15 feet from an open net, and then instead of kicking it into the goal he punches a ref in the fucking face."
7714,We're so goddamned close.
7715,Just wait until there is a solid population vaccinated (like 60%+ or whatever the math says will cause R to drop below 1).
7716,Otherwise we're going to get the world's worst submission to /r/Prematurecelebration
7717,[removed]
7718,"I think that it really doesn't matter if you don't sweat, you leave dead cells and stuff there :|"
7719,&gt;The executive order also removes the ability of local authorities to impose a mask mandate.
7720,"Abbott's order said: ""Individuals are strongly encouraged to wear face coverings over the nose and mouth wherever it is not feasible to maintain six feet of social distancing from another person not in the same household, but no person may be required by any jurisdiction to wear or to mandate the wearing of a face covering."""
7721,What a good damn new day.
7722,"Lower cases, more vaccines in production, and a much better projection for availability."
7723,Just about done-zo folks.
7724,"No worry, right now it’s only opinions and everybody is on their own scale of optimism."
7725,"Funny thing is, I’m usually accused of being pessimistic."
7726,"Upvoted for ""nuts to butts""!"
7727,First heard that expression while getting into a line for haircuts at boot camp.
7728,"Usually the DI said ""assholes to belly buttons"", but I had to hear each of those multiple times per day for 3 months."
7729,[deleted]
7730,"Yeah, we cancelled our august trip last year, and now with our first doses we're starting our plans for this year."
7731,"You mean all those shutdowns that made people loose their livelyhoods, been forced into abusive situations, and been forced to miss cancer screenings *aren’t* irreversible damage?"
7732,People who off themselves because of that can just get therapy eventually when this is over.
7733,"Obviously /s

Anyone who’s supported supported the measures taken over this past year cannot say they care about heath."
7734,Doesn’t change the fact that other places weren’t overrun though.
7735,Why were they shut down?
7736,"33, I’m with you."
7737,"Once they get to us, I don’t care how they give it."
7738,"In-store, drive-thru, blow dart."
7739,Just shoot it into me!
7740,"Oh please, canada has been taking advantage of us since WW2."
7741,There's a strong a reason why they have never been a bigger ally than let's say Spain.
7742,Which is why it's so important we get people vaccinated as soon as possible.
7743,Yes!!
7744,It is really sobering to actually face the reality of the risk of deadly virus.
7745,It's a stark contrast to Instagram Barbie life.
7746,"&gt; Yeah, I'm super confused where these people live that they can't do any of these things."
7747,I have a bit of an extreme situation but I haven't seen any friends in a year.
7748,I'm taking care of my mother who just finished chemotherapy so for a while she was at extremely high risk... and I live in New York City.
7749,Without a car.
7750,"To go see any of my friends, or to have my friends over, they'd have to take a subway, a huge vector for infection."
7751,"Short of buying a car and chauffeuring everyone around, the simple act of getting to and fro presented a huge risk to me and my family."
7752,You were in close contact with them today?
7753,So let's say this makes its way into America around August and everyone is fully vaccinated.
7754,Essentially we would have about the same level of immunity against this variant as we had with a regular ill-fitting surgical mask (the infected is without a mask) with the original COVID?
7755,Is my math correct?
7756,100 more?
7757,"1,000 more?"
7758,"100,000 more?"
7759,When should restrictions be lifted?
7760,When COVID goes to zero?
7761,I thought you were joking...
7762,But I see it's true.
7763,So glad I left Texas.
7764,the fear is that those idiots infect your &lt;16 year old kids

7786,I'm just looking to drive up and get a jab.
7787,At 39 by the time they reach my cohort I'm thinking that's what it will be like.
7788,Is “super variant” a scientific term?
7789,Is there an example of a “super variant” of a virus recorded somewhere?
7790,I think I am going to schedule a day off after my 2nd just in case.
7791,That way it is not a surprise or a rush to cover my work on short notice.
7792,"yeah, it would be fine if all adults got the vaccine but with anti-vaxxers, you still have to be cautious with your kids that can't get vaccinated yet"
7793,"I don't disagree with you, I'm just saying that I don't think it will be ""normal"" when many people with school-aged children are still not participating in society."
7794,"There aren't that many kids in my day-to-day life so I wouldn't notice, but I work with a lot of people who have kids and have a lot of friends with kids, many of whom have expressed that sentiment, and my life won't feel normal if I still don't see any of them :)."
7795,"Sure they did, the whole concept of ""flatten the curve"" was that it was all just temporary restrictions to keep hospitals from being overwhelemed."
7796,That was later turned into lockdowns until a vaccine.
7797,"Edit:  Here is fauci in April of 2020:

&gt;Still, Fauci warned that leaders have to be careful not to quickly loosen restrictions."
7798,"“We still have to put our foot on the accelerator when it comes to the mitigation and the physical separation,” he said."
7799,"Asked if things will be “back to normal” by summer, Fauci said he hopes that’s the case."

Notice, he is clearly not saying ""until there is a vaccine"""

7840,"The grocery stores will likely still have a mask policy for a while, that's not changing."
7841,"The people who wore a mask before probably still will and those who weren't, weren't wearing one anyways."

7870,You're putting words in people's mouths.
7871,"He said their COULD be a mental aspect to long covid, but post viral fatigue syndrome is a very real thing and can be seen in multiple viruses, including SARS"
7872,It’s about damn time to re open that’s forsure.
7873,Anyone scared or immunocompromised is still very able to stay home and use all these new services that became available this past year.
7874,"Right, but would this lifting of the mandate prevent places of business from requiring that to be in their store, office, etc?"
7875,If the US increases 1000 fold it can vaccinate the entire population in 4 days!
7876,Where?
7877,Can't fix stupid.
7878,Wasn’t it in Asia and Europe before we even confirmed a case??
7879,?
7880,You say that except there will be challenges and lawsuits to navigate.
7881,Lol the irony
7882,"I know the vaccines makers haven't been able to say it stops the spread, but that is more due to time constraints and having to get the vaccine out there in record time."
7883,"But I see no reason to think if it prevents infection, it doesn't also stop you from spreading it."
7884,"Apart from a few messed up vaccines, like an attenuated polio vaccine once, people vaccinated don't spread other diseases."
7885,And lastly I have seen some studies out of Israel that seem to show infections are going down since vaccination.
7886,So that's real world trials right there.
7887,&gt; The goal was to flatten the curve.
7888,"Texas has flattened the curve and it seems unlikely that hospitals will be overrun at this point, so I'm guessing that was the reasoning behind getting rid of the mandate."
7889,"The thing about flattening the curve is the curve can unflatten (as we saw the curve flatten in Texas from the July peaks to a low in Sept, followed by the recent peak in mid Jan this year)."
7890,"Sure vaccines will mitigate that, but as of today there's only ~7% vaccinated, and you can even throw in the ~10% that have had covid and recovered."
7891,"That leaves up to 80% (likely lower, but still above 2/3rds) of the population today, that would be at risk of infection."
7892,"I wonder if Osterholm it's alarmed that his ""hurricane of cases"" prediction isn't coming true."
7893,Almost as if people won't start listening to experts that are constantly wrong.
7894,You are medically illiterate.
7895,People not finishing courses of antibiotics is the reason why antibiotic resistant bacteria exist.
7896,"Please, please read up about how viruses and bacteria evolve."
7897,At this point I don’t know what the ceiling looks like.
7898,It nearly doubled my own pipe dream expectations for the end of the month on day #2.
7899,"I'm sure, but at that point, if you choose not be vaccinated with any of the 3 vaccines that are damn near 100% at preventing hospitalizations, that's their own fault"
7900,Unfortunately parents only carry so much weight and school funding is tied to their attendance so there is a strong financial incentive for the individual districts to follow the state lead.
7901,To compound things for me personally I am in a small rural community and am likely to be in the minority in my dissent.
7902,I don't have a problem wearing a mask.
7903,"I'm undecided if I will still continue to wear it or not after next week, but I still won't be going out a whole lot until I'm vaccinated."
7904,I know I just posted in here but... vaccines for *every* American by the end of MAY.

7915,"There's nothing wrong with acknowledging that mental health plays a role in physical health (things like cortisol levels, inflamation, fatigue, etc)."

7920,"More Republican-governed states will follow in quick succession, then soon after the moderate Democratic ones will too."
7921,"I expect NY and Cali will be the last ones, most likely in the summertime."
7922,This is the beginning of the end of restrictions and society will have to adjust quickly.
7923,We are only a few months away from masking and social distancing becoming a personal choice.
7924,Miss Biden... please my arm is right here I’m ready
7925,I can't really see the Arab Spring being one of those top events even within the 2000s.
7926,At this point the Arab Spring has almost been forgotten already by people who aren't close to those countries - how much international attention do you see Syria getting now?
7927,"For most countries it was always just some wars in countries on the other side of the world that people would make a show of sympathy over; until covid happened that kind of thing was the biggest kind of international crisis around to many people, but now I'd guess it seems completely insignificant to the average person dealing with the pandemic in another country."
7928,"It also didn't even really lead to many significant changes politically; most of the revolutions the Western media hyped up just ended up shuffling around various dictators, and there certainly wasn't some grand emergence of Western democratic ideals taking over like they were predicting."

7967,I mean biden did direct every state to now prioritize teachers and make sure every teacher has at least one dose by the end of this month to get students back in school.
7968,"Ohio did it and we went from 50% of students without an option to be in school to less than 10% now, and most of it is because Cleveland Metropolitian Schools has a fuck ton of teachers to vaccinate and they want to get all of them before they reopen."

8101,"I’m in Alberta, where we’re just finally getting some traction on vaccine distribution, and sure enough all the anti-maskers are using the fact that we’ve covered maybe a percentage point of the population as proof enough that we can lift ALL the restrictions immediately."
8102,"Last couple days, they’ve even been marching in the streets demanding an end to the “lockdown” (even though we’re not under a lockdown; businesses are open and we simply have capacity limits and mask mandates)."
8103,"Meanwhile our health minister says that we’re still uncertain about a full return to ordinary practices, because the UK variant is still very aggressive and we don’t have it nailed down in the places it’s appearing; lots of community spread with no obvious source that we can control."
8104,"If we lifted all of the restrictions tomorrow like the protestors want, we’d very quickly become a hotbed for the new strain far faster than we can vaccinate against it."
8105,"Long story short, don’t let people fuck this up."
8106,Keep exercising patience and wait for the metaphorical ship to come into the harbor before trying to jump the gap to the pier.
8107,"I remember it because the British media picked up on the 90%, then when the EU fell out with AZ everyone angered was quoting the 70%."

8111,They already are.
8112,We're over a year into the pandemic/restrictions
8113,It was a hard decision to make.
8114,"Those regulatory authorities are supposed to make decisions based on solid science, but somehow balance this with the general public need."
8115,There was too little data available on this age group to make any actual scientific decision.
8116,"However, the public need was clearly there."
8117,The EMA also acknowledged the fact that the data wasn't there but approved it regardless because effectiveness was to be presumed.
8118,But multiple national authorities decided otherwise.
8119,This really wasn't a clear cut decision.
8120,"We see now anyway that every country has different rules, the US hadn't accepted the whole oxford trial, India doesn't accept the pfizer trial."
8121,Every country has their own set of rules and every committee makes slightly different decisions.
8122,It's not all politics.
8123,You can't get 100% of people to do anything.
8124,Taking this vaccine in particular is going to be a tough stretch to get past 70% I think.

8131,"However, Florida remains far more impressive as he is below average in deaths-per-capita, in a crowded, politically-divided, and very old state despite not completely destroying businesses and, more importantly, the concept of human rights."

8137,"in the article it says ""indoor dining"" meaning restaurant settings with strangers, not indoor transient activities like shopping or hair styling where you can do it masked."
8138,Vaccines are showing pretty good protection against variants.
8139,"As an Essential Worker, let me assure you it was at least like halfish closed for a few months"
8140,I disagree.
8141,If we had all appointments from 1A/1B majority completed then I would agree but the majority of deaths and hospitalizations come from them.
8142,Only 7% of Texans are vaccinated so yet again the numbers will rise in these high risk groups.
8143,Why wouldn't he wait until the vaccine was widely available to those that truly need it?
8144,This is coming on the heels of the state also reducing vaccine doses to Dallas county after federal help stepped in.
8145,This left a gap in vaccine doses and now this?
8146,A structured step by step approach of rolling back would have been more logical.
8147,We will see how this plays out.
8148,"If I showed up to my parents house in 2019 coughing and sneezing with a case of the flu, yeah... my mom loves me, but she probably would have told me to go back home and lay down."

8233,Texas is full-fledged sprinting so we can crawl.
8234,Summer saw a drop because many states implemented mask mandates after seeing the initial surge of trying to reopen.
8235,"Also, summer did not guarantee lower cases."
8236,"In France, their cases surged between late August through September."
8237,They had more cases per 1M than the US.
8238,Late August was also problematic for the US because the rate of decline in new cases stalled.
8239,It is similar to now.
8240,"The tail risk of hospital overrun is much slimmer, but there could easily be isolated outbreaks."

8263,I would guess maybe around 2 hrs just based on I know the Panther can get someone results in 4 hours and online it says the Panther takes 2.5 hours to first results so something like the ID Now could potentially shaved that down to only a couple hours.
8264,*Non expert extrapolation
8265,Just like he invented the term 'prime the pump'

8291,"Seeing as the restrictions were initially implemented to keep hospital systems from being overwhelmed, one might argue it's a logical step to take."
8292,"K, the comment section has just become a fat hate circlejerk so comments are now locked."

8300,"Most conservatives know it works, they just needed the government to mandate it so they don’t seem “weak” for doing it."
8301,"The mandate gave them the excuse of “oh it’s not me, I just *have* to wear this.”"
8302,I posted a comment 20 minutes before his Tweet that Texas' actions will cause a ripple effect across the the south.
8303,Alabama's mandate probably not going to be extended.
8304,Arkansas' has 0% of being extended and they pretty much already said that.
8305,I keep waiting on Desantis (Florida's governor) to take Georgia and now Texas' lead and outright BAN local governments from making mandates.
8306,Once DeSantis does that I'd guess SC will be next.
8307,In the Midwest Indiana is going to be the first to remove their mandate.
8308,Ohio will resist but DeWine is feeling pressure from his party and I'd guess he'll follow Indiana shortly.

8397,They can still make mandates and fine BUSINESSES though.
8398,TX and GA have actually banned local governments from making any mandate at all.
8399,Well GA they can mandate them on LOCAL GOVERNMENT property.
8400,But in GA actual mandates have been outright banned from Day 1.

8407,I get that everyone wants full normal.
8408,"I do too, but I really think we all need to stick to wearing masks until the 100 days goal Biden set at the end of April."
8409,We’ll be much better off then in terms of vaccines.
8410,Too soon
8411,I think it’s just really hard to say.

8414,My wife’s boss started automatically scheduling post vaccination time off for people in her department after several of them were out sick for a few days from it.

8417,This is usually limited to the first 48-72 hours after getting the shot.

8419,!
8420,Any side effects?
8421,"Because I got my shot 2 days ago and those last 2 days, especially Monday, was f'd up."
8422,"Nausea, headache, had to take a s' every hour or so, fever and so on."
8423,How bout you?
8424,Edit: to clear things up: the side effects started showing roughly 12 hours or so after I was given the shot.

8445,I’m sure I’ll continue to wear it for months to come still.
8446,I think because they vaccinated people so fast a large part of that 55% dont have immunity yet.

8484,My work expected people to possibly call out though so they had more people on the schedule than usual lol.

8499,Shocker
8500,Exactly.
8501,That’s why the message isn’t resonating.
8502,It isn’t “hold on for 2-3 more months”    Phrases like that lead people to believe things will be more or less over then.
8503,Not the case if many of the experts on Twitter have their way.
8504,They’re rooting for masks and distancing mandates to be strictly enforced for years.
8505,Good.

8509,"&gt;\&gt;  *You* are the one who dismissed legitimate concerns of those who want to end restrictions as merely selfish desires to ""socialize."""
8510,I did no such thing.
8511,"You've been appropriating the then delegitimizing the people who have suffered by people who have foregone precautions, and then want to continue to forego precautions before reaching herd immunity."
8512,"It clearly shows that you don't really care about people who have suffered under this pandemic and are willing to appropriate the suffering (physical, mental, etc) of others for your rhetoric."
8513,You did that.
8514,No one else but you.
8515,"&amp;#x200B;

&gt;\&gt; I just pointed out that you are woefully out-of-touch and have no business pretending to understand the plight of those you are trying to pass judgment on, and that clearly struck a nerve."
8516,Lol says the person who's been appropriating my family's emotional and financial situation from this pandemic.
8517,You don't have any arguments so continue to appeal to the suffering of others that your policy would actually exacerbate the suffering of.
8518,&gt;Whatever - that's your problem.
8519,That a everyone problem if people like you can mess up the progress that's been made before we reach herd immunity.
8520,"&amp;#x200B;

&gt;No one else is reading at this point, and I could give less of a shit if I change *your* mind."
8521,Get better arguments then.
8522,"&amp;#x200B;

&gt;\&gt; The fact that you *still* can't acknowledge the possibility that someone might have an honest, well-intentioned disagreement with you over what policy is the most sensible - that to you, they're just selfish, full stop - is proof that you're just another armchair intellectual living in a bubble, whom no one needs to listen to."

8524,"Your arguments have only been based on ill-formed logic and selfishness, masked by the appropriation of the suffering of others and ad hominem attacks."

If Ohio can do it, so can the rest of us."
8529,"&gt;\&gt; Again, understand the terminology you are using and learn basic critical thinking before lecturing others."
8530,Herd immunity is not an on/off switch.
8531,There will be a gradual reduction in infections and hospitalizations until the level is manageable.
8532,The question is where that threshold lies.
8533,"So have you finally figured out the fact that I'm not a ""zero-covid"" person and now you just want to attack herd immunity?"
8534,"Until you reach herd immunity, you don't have adequate social protection from such a virus to warrant reducing social precautions."
8535,That's when you're out of the woods in terms of social precautions.
8536,"&amp;#x200B;

&gt;\&gt; *Reasonable* people can have *reasonable* disagreements over where the line ought to be drawn."
8537,"I wish I was talking to one right now....

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;\&gt;  Despite not even understanding how herd immunity works, you see fit to shout the term in the faces of everyone who thinks we're already on a sufficient downward trend that we should start opening up to alleviate the effects of these restrictions."
8538,"Again tall talk from someone who thought herd immunity meant I was for ""zero COVID"", you're sounding like someone who had to wikipedia the term just now, although you still don't have a full grasp on why it's an important threshold for many epidemiologists."
8539,"&amp;#x200B;

&gt;\&gt; Could it *possibly* be that maybe those people are aware of all the concerns you've raised, potentially have more at stake than you do, and have simply reached a different conclusion about the relative risks?"
8540,**Nah**.
8541,"They're just being selfish, and don't care about other people at all - decrees the dude comfortably working from home while other people file for unemployment benefits."
8542,How many nurses are urging people to open back up?

Also again thanks for just not even missing the fact that my brother, who lost his fucking job, insurance, and in debt that we're trying to pay off, shares the same views as I do, if not moreso radical than mine."
8544,"&amp;#x200B;

&gt;\&gt; Again, you're not a serious or honest interlocutor, and I'm sure that's plainly evident to anyone who places so low a value on their time that they'd bother reading this exchange."
8545,"Again, you describe yourself wonderfully."
8546,"&amp;#x200B;

Also again, thanks for not even responding to the vast majority of my points above."
8547,I'll just assume you had no meaningful retort.
8548,Using what point to invalidate masks?
8549,That it wasn't far enough?
8550,What does that have to do with anything?
8551,"Just so you know, we never really shut down again in Texas."
8552,Bars simply classified themselves as restaurants and reduced capacity is sorta being followed.
8553,I'm speaking as someone who lives in Dallas where precautions are being taken a little bit more seriously than other parts of the state.
8554,"The main thing that's changed is concerts and events aren't happening, and that is still the case for the foreseeable future."
8555,This really won't change much and the numbers will reflect that.
8556,There are tons of people who haven't been taking it seriously this whole time.
8557,[removed]
8558,Sure.
8559,India and Africa because they don’t know.
8560,China and Russia because they don’t want anyone else to know.
8561,Your immune response does it!
8562,A stronger/larger immune response will have you feeling worse.
8563,The state of Florida lies about their numbers and arrests whistleblowers so we can't trust the data coming from them.
8564,"I won't be surprised if mandatory vaccinations become a normal thing for the majority of international travel, and possibly other kinds of disease screening and such."
8565,"Also security/hygiene theater in airports, public events, and other gathering places will probably stay ramped up to unprecedented levels for years; I expect contagious disease to basically be the new terrorism until the next household name threat happens."
8566,Then why they keep saying nothing changes aftr vaccinations
8567,"I haven't, I purposely haven't been following it because honestly it's something I don't want to know about until I need to, if that makes sense."
8568,"I mean, I respect y'all that do but I'm just better off without it."
8569,If a variant becomes dominant or significant in some way though then yeah I'll be willing to change my attitude about it then.
8570,There is no science to support ending the mask mandate at this point.
8571,&gt;I keep waiting on Desantis (Florida's governor) to take Georgia and now Texas' lead and outright BAN local governments from making mandates.
8572,"Correct me if I'm wrong but I believe he banned fines to enforce mask mandates, which effectively prevents any town's mask mandate from mattering since no one is going to imprison people for not wearing masks."
8573,I have a friend who's visiting family in Florida right now and he told me the only time he sees people wearing masks is if a business specifically won't allow you in without one.
8574,Spare me the fucking histrionics unless you were so worried about infectious diseases that claimed many millions of lives before covid ever existed.
8575,As smart as Bait.
8576,No way in hell my county judge would ever do that
8577,"That's the importance of ""has access to."""
8578,"We have to hit the point where if you don't have the vaccine, that's on you."
8579,"No, good luck to us."
8580,"We may not live there, but we will all be impacted"
8581,Well isn't that the point?
8582,Not wearing a mask increases the risk of other people around you.
8583,How are we a year into this and people STILL don't understand the primary benefit of masking?
8584,Just got mine today as a teacher!
8585,I can't wait for real life again.
8586,"Yeah, dude, there wasn't dick open a few weeks ago."
8587,Everything froze
8588,Wearing masks protect those *around* you more than they protect the wearer.
8589,"Yes, it still provides protection to a wearer, but the thing they do best is block the brunt of viral particles being expelled."
8590,We need to give the vaccines a chance to work instead of potentially sabotaging them when less than 90%+ of people in Texas are still susceptible to COVID.
8591,"So the timeline has to be dictated by the vaccine rollout, not by our personal preferences."
8592,"&gt; ""you can have my mask when you pry it from my cold dead hands."""
8593,"FFS, no one is going to kick your door in and wrestle it away from you."
8594,"&gt; Get it and die

Lol, can you please tell me the probability of that occurring in a healthy adult who is younger than 65?"
8595,Keep living your life in fear if that's what you want.
8596,That's what I thought.
8597,People are still allowed to wear the masks if they feel inclined to.
8598,Or stay home!
8599,Watch any stream.
8600,People are going out to bars and getting wasted.
8601,"Sure they are wearing masks but drinking etc

Time to stop this myth that Japanese people are like ants and just follow the gov blindly"
8602,You don’t have to quarantine.
8603,I am not against lifting restrictions slowly.
8604,But lifting them all at the same time without any precaution is straight up stupid.
8605,How are poor people supposed to isolate if their job won't let them and their families (the people they live with) take 10 days off?
8606,[deleted]
8607,"Well, I got my AZ shot 2 days ago and the side effects, although only for the predicted 48 hours, where disgusting."
8608,"Headache, fever, general body pain, bowel problems, my ducking back hurt like a mofo, I could only piss sitting down because I got nauseous trying it while standing up like I usually do."
8609,"Given, only the first day was really awful, and given, too, that Paracetamol helped a lot reducing the symptoms, it's still a ma'afacka of side effects."
8610,And that's what I will tell anyone who wants to listen.
8611,"The side effects are awful, but I hope that it's worth it on the long run."
8612,"My father in law got a different vac at the same time as me and the only 2 things he can tell are/ where a horrible case of the munchies Sunday night (if such things can be called ""horrible"")."
8613,"He described it as ""the hungriest he ever was since his days in the army""."
8614,"And his arm hurts where he got the shot, as does mine, but that's normal, I'd reckon."
8615,"Still, it's a mofo."
8616,Let's all hope for the best
8617,then those people (who supported the mandate) will continue to wear masks then
8618,Sure it did.

8627,There may be a behavioral factor as well.
8628,"Knowing that a large percentage of their population is vaccinated, people may be more likely to flout social distancing rules."
8629,Almost certainly the vaccine reduces transmissibility; but it’s probably the case that only in conjunction with social distancing can we get r0 close to zero.
8630,Most Syrians and Venezuelans are not obese or even overweight which is the biggest factor after age.
8631,Their deaths should be much lower.
8632,"When it comes to the chances of COVID developing these kinds of mutations, every % counts."

8640,100%.
8641,If this thing has taught us anything its that people don't trust experts enough.
8642,We wouldn't be in this mess to quite the extent if people had stayed home and worn a mask when asked.
8643,That goes doubly so for businesses of course.

8647,how much longer should we quarantine then?
8648,Thx for the hint but I think we both misremembered.

8705,The difference: there was no logical end in sight a year ago when we had zero clue how COVID worked and we had no vaccines.

8710,"SMART goals- specific, measurable, attainable, realistic, important goals."
8711,I'm not necessarily anti restrictions- I'm against them w/out this acronym in mind.
8712,"Yes, but only until a magic number of us have been vaccinated."
8713,"We are not close to that number, and we will never reach it if our elected leaders are playing denial instead of taking a lead in teaching people that vaccinations are safe."
8714,I absolutely agree.
8715,"That said, there are very very few contraindications to the vaccine."
8716,"In fact the CDC’s website only lists three, and they don’t include many people."
8717,99.9% of adults should get the vaccine
8718,This is how Abbott distracts the base from blaming him for the failure to manage the freezing storm.
8719,"We need to do both

You can't actually force people to stay home and go to the store."
8720,"You also can't check the temperature of everyone at the grocery store, its both a massive invasion of privacy and would take too long."
8721,"So while getting people to stay home is the best method of preventing the spread of diseases, it can't be the only tool we use."

8723,I wish that were true.
8724,I've seen a few people at my HEB without masks.
8725,And plenty of people crowding in lines not giving everyone space.
8726,The goal was to flatten the curve.
8727,"Texas has flattened the curve and it seems unlikely that hospitals will be overrun at this point, so I'm guessing that was the reasoning behind getting rid of the mandate."
8728,"Talking about the flu because for a vast majority, it is."
8729,Why do you think asymptomatic spread was an issue?
8730,It wasn't for the people without symptoms.
8731,"Once the at risk people are vaccinated, the pandemic is pretty much over."
8732,It's just getting everyone else.

8855,"being an absolute moron again, in other news, water is wet."
8856,"In theory, if hand to face transmission is even a fraction as likely as airborne transmission, and the virus can survive on surfaces for at least hours, then surface transmission should be significant simply because all virus in the air eventually settles on a surface."
8857,"Volume is the square of surface area so in theory the concentration of virus which can accumulate on a surface is quadratically higher than the airborne concentration in the same space, integrated over the viruses survival period on that surface."
8858,"In other words, if an infected person walks down an aisle in your grocery store, the air in that aisle might be infectious for several minutes, but all the food on the shelves will remain infectious for hours, and that infectivity will compound with each time an infected person walks down the aisle."
8859,But we see that this isn't the case.
8860,It seems like you need a solid dose right to the sinuses to get infected.
8861,"Which is really good, because if hand to face transmission was likely then we would have been seriously fucked because it would mean that masks would be a huge risk for cross contamination."

9019,"Coming up with resonant campaigns that kids, parents, and adults in general can get behind is, collectively, our best bet at fighting the obesity epidemic."
9020,"I do support your idea that capitalism incentivizes bad eating habits, but I don't think it's within the capacity of a western country to sharply steer that ship aright (especially the United States, with its hardline approach to personal liberty)."
9021,Weird pronunciation of World War 2
9022,"It's putting a specific selection pressure on it though, that doesn't exist when spread unchecked."
9023,Yes mutations happen more often with more spread.
9024,Most do nothing.
9025,Selection pressure is what results in mutations spreading rapidly.
9026,Never had Covid (as far as I know).
9027,"It wasn't severe or anything, sore arm and fairly heavy fatigue, but I didn't notice anything after my second."
9028,Arm was fine even.
9029,My understanding is covid is so contagious that if you're unmasked around someone infected with it for more than a few minutes you're very likely to catch it.
9030,A few weeks back when infection rates were at the peak the area I live in had around 1/50 people actively infected at any given time.
9031,That means in any decently sized group of unmasked people you're extremely likely to get exposed.
9032,"It probably doesn't seem as bad as it is because 90% of people that catch it never show more than mild, ignore-able, symptoms."
9033,I haven't lived a no-risk life the past 12 months.
9034,"I've traveled, but I kept human contact to a minimum and got tested before and after the trips."
9035,"I've gone to stores more often than is necessary, but I'm not hanging around inside browsing and I wear a well fitted mask."
9036,I've spent time with friends many times without masks on but kept the group size to 2 if we haven't been tested recently.
9037,Mention you did any of those things on subreddits like /r/BayArea and people will quickly call you out as a superspreader.
9038,I've tried to do the research needed to determine what behavior carries an appropriate amount of risk.
9039,"And after 3 anti-body tests, 3 at-home tests and one rapid test I've never shown a positive result."
9040,"It's possible I swung too far to the side of caution, but I have some anecdotal evidence that supports me."
9041,I've had neighbors throw parties for a dozen (untested) people and they all got covid.
9042,Maybe there's confirmation bias there and I've forgotten all of the parties I've heard of where everyone ended up fine.
9043,I can't wait until it's filled with interesting retrospective and follow-on studies.
9044,Maybe also all the new projects that leaned on COVID learnings?
9045,Saw something yesterday about a malaria vaccine based on the COVID mRNA vaccines.
9046,Models suggest that public mask wearing is most effective at reducing spread of the virus when compliance is high (39).
9047,"We recommend that mask use requirements are implemented by governments, or, when governments do not, by organizations that provide public-facing services."
9048,"Again, the modelling means nothing if the real world results do not match the modelling."
9049,"California, mask mandate: 1,328 deaths per million
Florida, no mask mandate: 1,443 deaths per million

Ohio, mask mandate: 1,484 deaths per million
Texas, no mask mandate: 1,524 deaths per million

All of the worst states in the country - New York, New Jersey, etc."
9050,have mask mandates.
9051,The real world results do not match the modelling.

9053,"I'll be passing on it myself, but that is a very unpopular opinion on here."
9054,I'll be shopping for a mRNA or novavax (when approved) vaccine.
9055,"No one will change my mind, so don't bother."
9056,This link seems to suggest they will manufacture the J&amp;J vaccine in three sites.
9057,"&gt; While it awaits a hoped-for emergency use authorization from the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) by the end of the month, Johnson &amp; Johnson says that the key first step of vaccine production will take place at only three sites:  its own facility in the Netherlands, a manufacturing subcontractor in India, and at Emergent's facility in Baltimore."

9066,When the virus spreads unchecks there is a much greater risk of mutation.
9067,More infections = more mutations.
9068,So a strategy that is massively reducing the number of infections is also reducing the mutation risk.
9069,No doubt this is true.
9070,"However, I would be interested in knowing how many people with chronic pain that has worsened in any given year without a pandemic."
9071,But will we learn anything from this?
9072,Will pandemics and vaccines be more common in the future?
9073,anyone know what’s the deal with the SA variant in the UK now?

9075,"My impression of most European counties is that they have universal healthcare, state supported college education, and strong protections for workers."
9076,Do you have strong social safety nets?

9078,You’ll also lose your healthcare in that scenario.
9079,Is that the case in Scotland?
9080,Is Scotland like America in really any respect?
9081,"When people are told they have no one to depend on but themselves, and their government agrees (as it does in the American south, where I live), people are absolutely tougher individually because failure isn’t an option."

9087,"If you want to know why, just remember that the downvote button on reddit was designed as a way to mark spam and trolling, then think about how it actually gets used."
9088,"No, it's not about how Americans work and I never said that, it's how it effects everyone everywhere."
9089,"It doesn't matter where you were during COVID, US, Brazil, Australia, Botswana, Germany, Japan, Saudi Arabia, or basically any other country on the planet, your daily life was likely changed quite a bit due to COVID."
9090,How you did something as simple as seeing and interacting with family and friends was changed.
9091,There's nothing else to compare that to in recent history and nothing on that list I feel rises anywhere close to that level.
9092,The moon landing?
9093,The Arab spring?
9094,The fall of the Soviet Union?
9095,None of those had nearly the daily impact on people in every single country as COVID.
9096,What impact did the Arab spring have on the day-to-day life of the average person in South America?
9097,I'm betting not a whole lot beyond it being a news story.
9098,"Like I said, if you were in a very specific area of the world, some of those might have mattered a lot, far more than COVID."
9099,"If you were somewhere else, they might not have mattered much at all."
9100,That's not the case with COVID.
9101,"Unless you're in some kind of situation where you have no contact with the outside world, you were impacted."
9102,"Haggling over the price and liability details of the solution to this crisis, causing underprioritized delivery schedules."
9103,Insisting on full approval rather than emergency approval whilst dealing with the greatest health crisis in modern history.
9104,You would think the EU is run by people whom live in their own little world with no sense of urgency.
9105,"Congratulations EU, you figured out urgent situations require urgent solutions."
9106,"It only took you exactly a year to figure it out, absolute muppets."
9107,Or maybe trust that they won’t like the many other vaccines there are in the world.
9108,Jeeze why so negative.
9109,Are you a scientist?
9110,A doctor?
9111,"It's not the race card, it's just how we've treated people."
9112,American exceptionalism is a false notion and part of why people have felt entitled to do whatever they want this whole time.
9113,"I'm pointing out that, while we have long advertised a land of liberty, the actualities are quite different, and the idea that we're freer than other western nations is false."
9114,"I would say it got it more back on track, the progress with switching to remote work and online work has been incredibly slow since we were able to start transitioning in the last 1990s'."

9329,Michigan's Governor Whitmer is giving an optimistic press conference.
9330,"Going up to 50% restaurant capacity, and relaxing entertainment and leisure limits."
9331,She even gave a number for ditching the masks (70% vaccination rate)
9332,"Unfortunately a lot of doctors/health care providers have experienced extreme blowback from patients for addressing weight as a concern, largely associated with the body positivity movement."
9333,"If you’re a family practitioner that wants to keep patients, there can be a lot of pressure not to tick them off by bringing up weight, which is extremely bad for public health overall."

9339,"(Fatigue, chills etc etc)"
9340,Wasnt that a good part of the point of it?

9342,I see your point.

9344,"At the end of the day, whatever safety measures you take (in regards to anything) are for you to decide."
9345,"The same principle applies to others, especially if they have severe medical conditions."
9346,"The information that's out there may be enough for you, but it may not be for everyone."
9347,"Nah, even that has too much BS."
9348,"The messaging should be ""We're doing well and getting better."
9349,"Give us 2 months to allow everyone to get the vaccine then we'll drop restrictions"" No need to talk about 2022, or winter, or any other crap."
9350,"It’s over when people stop caring and following restrictions, aka the social end to the pandemic."

9352,"I agree with you 95% of the time, but fuck is it annoying working out with a mask."
9353,"And also, for me the problem isn’t even the mask, it’s the conditioning I’ve made on myself to stop touching my face, can’t wait to be able to do it with no worries."
9354,Already seeing people say they don’t want J&amp;J and will wait to get an mRNA vaccine for the higher efficacy.

9358,"&gt; we will not be ""normal"" by summer."
9359,"Who was talking about ""by summer?"""
9360,Thought we were talking about what would be happening on September 11th here.
9361,"Also, let's define what ""normal"" means."
9362,Because when a senior **World** Health Official talks about normal that means a lot different than the University of Alabama AD is talking about normal.
9363,"So, here's the question:  Will the University of Alabama have 100,000 people in attendance when their football team plays Mercer on September 11th?"
9364,The answer is almost assuredly yes.
9365,"Will it be ""safe.?"""
9366,"Well, now we have to define ""safe."""
9367,"Yes, I believe that by September 11th there will be relatively low numbers of community spread in the US and that COVID-19 will no longer be a pandemic level virus in the US, but instead be an endemic virus that is no longer substantially life altering."
9368,No one knows if it has safety for children and suprize... Children are not susceptible to the virus.
9369,Why vaccinate them at all?
9370,Madness
9371,"I got my first dose of Moderna on Friday morning, and i’m not feeling any better."

9375,It took me an hour to change my bedsheets yesterday.
9376,"My symptoms have been on and off... Fridays night I wasn’t feeling well, Saturday I had fever symptoms (sweating with chills) but beyond that I felt fine."
9377,Sunday night I went into work feeling okay but after an hour or so I really started suffering.
9378,It was a long night.
9379,My appetite is a fraction of what it used to be.
9380,"I left work at 7 Monday morning and went straight home, sleeping all morning."
9381,That didn’t help.
9382,"I tried using wash cloths that were rinsed with cold water to physically cool down my body, that helped a little bit."
9383,I wasn’t expecting to feel this way four days later.
9384,Anyone have advice?
9385,they're gonna have a wake up call when their job calls them back to the office realizing that their commute to work is essential to the surrounding economy lmfao.
9386,There probably was no deal required since Merck and J&amp;J let it slip they were in talks in January ever since Merck's own vaccine flamed out.
9387,GSK is also going to produce CureVac and Sanofi is going to produce Biontech (which Pfizer is also producing).

9392,Him actually taking the vaccine is good coverage for the vaccine for the anti-vaxxers among his supporters.
9393,Didn’t they make those dogshit vaginal meshes too?
9394,There is plenty of evidence they are.
9395,The evidence we have shows they are effective against the variants but not quite as effective as it is against garden variety covid
9396,The church claims (may be right or wrong) that J&amp;J used more.
9397,"The US has been sequencing cases this whole time, just a relatively small portion of confirmed cases."
9398,"Even if they didn't know to look for it at the time, the sequence data still exists and can be identified in retrospect."
9399,It does not make sense that in thousands of cases sequenced the B.1.1.7 variant happened to only make up less than 1% despite actually making up the majority of infections.
9400,Haha you actually made me laugh
9401,Probably not.
9402,The clinical trial said it’s important to wait like probably at least 19 days between doses as they tested between 19-23 days apart for Pfizer and 4 weeks for Moderna.
9403,But they said they believe the same results could be achieved if taken within 6 weeks.
9404,Some countries are spreading out doses by 12 weeks and there is evidence to suggest that also may be an effective approach it’s just not what the manufacturer tested so no way to know for sure until we try it.
9405,That being said based on the dosing regimen of other multi shot vaccines it’s very likely that this 12 week approach may work just as well so I wouldn’t stress about it.
9406,Just try to get it within 6 weeks if possible but they will most likely have very good protection even if it ends up being later than that.
9407,Yeaaaaaaaaaaaaah right.
9408,Or Fauci saying don't wear masks and laughing about it while the Trump Admin.
9409,was securing a supply of masks for themselves...
9410,What frustrates me is that we're really slow in lifting measures because it might have consequences but we're faster than lightning to implement them even though the measures themselves also have a lot of consequences.
9411,"There is no need for all the freak out, we're not trying to eliminate covid, just protect the people at risk from it."
9412,I saw that as well.
9413,I think they will change their tune as they lose more money over the next year.
9414,The priority should be to vaccinate the most at risk.
9415,Then the most people.
9416,Meetings that could have been an email?
9417,"*Love* Zoom, please let me half listen while getting actual work done."
9418,"Same for events that I only would have attended out of expectations, like the company holiday party."
9419,Meetings where I'd actually get some valuable cross-talk or networking opportunities out of them?
9420,Definitely miss.
9421,Check graphs via the link.
9422,"From the article:

EL PAÍS looks at how the country’s Covid-19 inoculation drive will progress under several different scenarios: at the current speed, at the rate of the United States and if first doses are prioritized

Spain has administered two doses of the Covid-19 vaccine to 2.6% of the population."
9423,"Although the pace of the vaccination drive picked up in the last week of February, the rollout has been more or less steady over the month: every day, 0.17% of the population are injected with one dose, which equates to around 500,000 people per week."
9424,"At this rate, the European Union’s target of vaccinating 70% of the adult population before the summer – amounting to 58% of Spain’s total population – will not be met."
9425,"As the graph below shows, if the current speed is maintained, barely 20% of the total population will have received two doses by September."
9426,"-



Spain’s regions – which are in charge of the vaccination campaign as well as handling the response to the pandemic in their territories – have been prioritizing the second dose of the Covid-19 vaccine, in accordance with the Health Ministry’s protocol."
9427,"The three vaccines that have so far been approved by the EU – from Moderna, Pfizer and Oxford-AstraZeneca – all require two doses, separated by a specified interval."
9428,"As a result of this strategy, the first dose is administered for around three weeks, then alternates with the second dose for another three-week period."
9429,The solid lines on the graph represent the evolution so far: about 3% of Spaniards have received both doses and another 1% have received the first dose and are waiting for the second.
9430,The dashed lines show how the numbers of people vaccinated will evolve if the current rate is maintained.
9431,"To reach the 70% target, weekly vaccinations in Spain will have to increase fourfold."
9432,The central government is confident this will happen.
9433,"The Health Ministry announced that 6.5 million doses of the AstraZeneca, Moderna and Pfizer vaccine would arrive in Spain by the end of March."
9434,And there million-euro contracts for the new vaccine by Janssen – which only requires one dose – and the vaccine by CureVac for the coming months.
9435,"However, for Spain to be able to quadruple the number of weekly doses administered, two conditions must be met: the vaccines must arrive on time – there have been delays in the past – and it must have the capacity to administer them."
9436,"In general, Spain has been administering vaccines at the rate at which they have been arriving."
9437,"As of February 25, Spain had administered 87% of doses received, one of the highest percentages in the European Union, according to data from the European Center for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC), which has pointed to limited supply as the biggest challenge to the EU rollout."
9438,"Spain has not yet had a problem administering the received doses, but it could start to become one."
9439,"While the first phase of Spain’s vaccination campaign targeted staff and residents of care homes, frontline health workers and adults in need of daily care who were not in residences – who can be easily located – the next stage includes members of the general population, such as essential workers, which may present difficulties."
9440,"“Vaccinating professional groups is more complex,” explains Jaime Jesús Pérez, a doctor from the Vaccinology Association."
9441,"“You have to have at least two weeks just to organize the information on who gets vaccinated and who doesn’t.”


The country with the fastest vaccination campaign is Israel, where 37% of the population have received two doses and 53% have received the first."
9442,"This has been achieved by vaccinating more than 200,000 people a day – the equivalent of 2% of the population."
9443,"In Spain, this rate is 0.17%, nearly one-third of the speed in the United States (0.45%) and the United Kingdom (0.5%)

Best-case scenarios
The speed of the vaccination drive in Spain is likely to accelerate."
9444,"In fact, 30% more doses were administered in the last week of February than the previous week."
9445,"As well as receiving more vaccines, the country is also learning how to optimize the process."
9446,"As Jesús Pérez points out: “We are seeing the usefulness of mass vaccination points, such as sports centers, which are going to be key when there are more vaccines."
9447,"A lot of people can arrive at the same time and wait while maintaining a safe distance, something that is impossible at a health center.”

The question is whether the rate will increase enough to reach the goal of immunizing 70% of adults by summer."
9448,Here’s how vaccination would progress in three possible scenarios.
9449,Four times the number of doses.
9450,"Last week, Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez told the lower house of parliament, the Congress of Deputies, that the number of vaccines arriving would increase fourfold in the second quarter of the year."
9451,"The repercussions of this are evident in the graph below, which shows how the number of people vaccinated would progress if, as of April 19, the number of doses administered is multiplied by four."
9452,"With this acceleration, by the beginning of September, around 58% of people would be vaccinated, surpassing the threshold of 70% of adults."
9453,At the US rate.
9454,"Another optimistic reference based on the actual experience of other countries is to assume that the rate of vaccination in Spain can match the current rate in the US, where 0.45% of the population receives one dose a day."
9455,"It would not, however, be enough to reach the EU’s goal: 50% of the entire population would be vaccinated by the end of the summer, accounting for 60% of adults."
9456,And if just the first dose is administered?
9457,"The above scenarios are all simulations based on the same strategy, which is the one followed in Spain: second doses are always prioritized, so that there are three weeks in which a group of people receive their first dose and then another three weeks in which the same people receive a second."
9458,"In this way, there are periods of three weeks where only one dose is given and another three-week period where the second dose is given."
9459,"Spain’s regions have so far followed this strategy, with the idea that it guarantees maximum protection for the groups being vaccinated."
9460,"As can be seen in the graph below, there are three weeks when only the line representing first doses goes up; then it stops and the line for the second dose starts to rise."
9461,"The model is not perfect, because there are exceptions and because regions can vaccinate at different speeds."
9462,And it will most likely become less clear as time goes by.
9463,"For the moment, it is confirmation that Spain, like most of Europe, is following a vaccination protocol that seeks to maximize the number of people who have received both doses."
9464,But this is not the only viable strategy.
9465,"In the UK, the authorities opted from the outset to administer as many first doses as possible and to postpone the second doses – from Pfizer and AstraZeneca – by up to 12 weeks."
9466,The aim is to reduce the spread of the virus as soon as possible by immunizing as many people as possible: in the first three months the pace is very fast and the number of people who have at least partial protection doubles.
9467,The following graph shows what the situation in Spain would be like if the country had followed a strategy similar to the one in the UK.
9468,"At the current speed of the Spanish vaccination drive, 5% of the population would have received at least one dose and almost 20% would have received one by the end of May, when second doses would begin to be administered."
9469,"By the end of the summer, 25% of the population would have received one dose and about 20% would have been given two doses."
9470,Most countries rejected the UK strategy because the outcome was less assured – the results of the Pfizer or Moderna trials had focused on testing efficacy of two doses separated by three to four weeks.
9471,But studies using data from Israel and the UK are finding that the first dose already offers considerable protection against Covid-19 and the risk of hospitalization.
9472,It may also prevent up to 50% of transmission one month after being administered.
9473,"Epidemiologist Miguel Hernan of Harvard University published a study on the effects of the vaccine in Israel over the past few weeks that confirmed that one dose can provide a high level of protection, but also pointed to the superior efficacy of the second dose."
9474,"“Our results indicate that a single dose is effective, although not as effective as two doses,” he says."
9475,“This is not surprising.
9476,It was already seen in the clinical trial.
9477,"It will be interesting to see in future studies whether spacing the doses further apart increases effectiveness after the second dose.”

As we have seen time and again during this pandemic, choosing strategies is a matter of risk management as decisions have to be made based on incomplete information."
9478,"“As of today, there is no solid data to confirm the superiority of using existing vaccines to prioritize first doses [as the UK does] rather than to complete the vaccination regimen in three-to-four-4 [as virtually all other countries do],” says Hernan."
9479,"“With the information currently available, both strategies can be justified."
9480,"Fortunately, in two to three months, when vaccine availability is much greater, this debate will cease to be relevant.”

English version by Heather Galloway."
9481,YES.
9482,"We do Zoom with my parents and my husband's parents about once a week or so (both sets of parents live 8-10 hours away), and I don't mind that."
9483,"But the virtual work happy hours/""team building events"", virtual parties... just stop."
9484,Outside for sure.
9485,I still wear my mask at my indoor apartment gym to be safe
9486,One bright note here is the 4 fold reduction in symptomatic cases amongst the vaccinated in just 12 days.
9487,That's a remarkably quick ramp up to some protection.
9488,I wonder if the vaccine offers some protection against severe disease at 12 days as well?
9489,"If it starts to reduce symptomatic infection, it might also reduce disease severity early on as well."
9490,"I had to write fuckin browser JavaScript to notify me of an open slot, there’s so many creative ways to get this"
9491,And you will 99% of the time.
9492,But people should also not be shamed for wearing a mask if they are sick or something.
9493,It is legitimately wild to me you think Massachusetts is the  insane one in this scenario lol.
9494,"Please stay inside forever, do us all a favor."
9495,Current COVID vaccines are not FDA-approved but are being used widely anyhow.
9496,Really?
9497,You are having the wedding to get it over with?
9498,I will never understand US wedding culture.

9502,In California they literally put caution tape in front of the ocean for miles.
9503,"What places are ""closed""?"
9504,There's places that have restrictions on capacity but that's about it.
9505,I’m sorry for your loss.
9506,There was a lot we didn’t know last year to plan that way ❤️
9507,Twitter should not be the judge.
9508,Emerging science can be heresy until proven otherwise.
9509,Let the internet be a battleground of ideas.
9510,Let stupid people be wrong.
9511,Fuck this.
9512,The goal was to prevent as many deaths as possible.
9513,"The vast majority of these happen in the at risk population, so once they're vaccinated we'll be fine."
9514,The only other concern was hospitals but it'll solve that problem too.
9515,"Herd immunity will arrive through vaccination and natural infection, and should be here in summer."
9516,"Sure, but the US could potentially have its cake and eat it too by pushing the second dose interval out to 8 weeks - that would allow nearly every adult to receive a first dose in March/April, and they could then go back and do second doses in May/June"
9517,But the data shows it works for the recommended interval.
9518,There's no data on what the efficacy would be if you were to give the 2nd show at a much longer interval.
9519,"In order to get it past approval for the FDA, you need to present data that it works with that."
9520,"It is a good thing that the FDA don't work on the ""It will probably work"" philosophy."
9521,"I don’t disagree about the risk of the sidewalk outside, and I don’t think masks should be mandated outside."
9522,I believe here in nyc it’s outside IF social distance can’t be maintained and some read that as “close contact” and some interpret it as “passing people on the street briefly” and I will be honest I am not sure which it is.
9523,It’s winter and I tend to wear it because it doesn’t bother me but I certainly don’t yell at anyone who doesn’t.
9524,So if he wants to wear one it makes no difference to me.
9525,Low is relative.
9526,"OK, you're just trolling now."
9527,"If I could go back and do things differently, I'd have gone to the courthouse when the lockdowns started a year ago, not told anyone except the witnesses, and then planned a public wedding and reception for sometime in fall of '21 or spring of '22."
9528,Life can throw a lot of shitty curveballs and dealing with my fiance's death without having any legal rights over his estate has been a giant clusterfuck.
9529,"The terrifying thing for me was walking around late Feb to early March knowing it was here, fully stocked up at home, and waiting for the rest of society to realize wtf was going to happen."
9530,Massive anxiety all day every day until my job went WFH.
9531,"&gt; “vaccines aren’t the answer because you can still spread the virus”

I mean, that's not exactly misinformation though, is it?"
9532,"Vaccines aren't _the_ answer, they're _part_ of the answer."
9533,"Until we have widespread immunity all of us, including those who _have_ been vaccinated, should continue to treat this as a clear and present threat."
9534,The point of lockdowns and social distancing measures is to *prolong* the pandemic and *slow it down* as to avoid overflowing the hospitals.
9535,Is there some special reason why the people who paid for high efficacy vaccines should give them away to other people?
9536,What makes your life more valuable than mine?
9537,Israel paid more than any country for the high efficacy doses they got and for how quickly they got them.
9538,They now enjoy one of the most vaccinated populations in the world.
9539,No one is criticizing them.
9540,Just America.
9541,As usual.
9542,"I don't know, maybe."
9543,"If this pandemic is that serious, why even use placebos?"
9544,How is that helpful?
9545,"Chiropractors don't have medical degrees, and many of them seem to think that chiropracty is some sort of alternative medicine that can cure COVID, AIDS, and erectile dysfunction."
9546,My wife's chiropractor was an anti-vaxx nut years before COVID.
9547,"Good at fixing a stiff neck, but we just ignored his ""advice"" on literally everything else."
9548,Appreciate the answer and I agree with you.
9549,I asked the question more in a way of finding an answer if there is a certain type of vaccine that is more suited and recommended towards people of my age and health status.
9550,Anything is better than nothing of course and I won’t be hestitating to get my shot if one isn’t available etc; just looking for more knowledge on the subject!
9551,"Even the so called ""third world countries"" are doing better than us, shame"
9552,Am I an asshole for trying to get on a cancellation/standby list for a vaccine?
9553,"I am in phase 1C (my state’s current phase), but I am not in the age group they’re currently working through."
9554,"&gt;Dr Rochelle Walensky said about 70,000 new cases a day had been recorded last week - ""a very high number""."
9555,"The U.S. has plateaued, but at a very high daily number of new cases."
9556,This is not a number that the U.S. should be comfortable.
9557,"&gt;There were nearly 2,000 deaths a day in the same period, she added."
9558,Still really high.
9559,"&gt;""Please hear me clearly: at this level of cases, with variants spreading, we stand to completely lose the hard-earned ground we have gained,"" Dr Walensky said."
9560,"""These variants are a very real threat to our people and our progress."""
9561,The U.S. needs to stay vigilant even when one has been vaccinated.
9562,"One still needs to wear a mask, social distance, and follow sanitization protocols."
9563,"Now if you and your friendship bubble have all been vaccinated, then it should be safe for you to have dinner indoors and do things together."

9585,sure.
9586,we need good information.
9587,not infringing mandates.
9588,simple as.
9589,There is no evidence to suggest that the vaccines are effective against any of these variants.
9590,As well as the storage requirements of the other vaccines.
9591,This will be much easier to provide to people in less developed areas.
9592,Does anyone else feel the need to bully/pummell people who have the privilege of working from home telling the rest of us to just stay home and order UberEats?
9593,"Must be nice to have that choice, now how do the rest of us pay our bills and survive?"
9594,No it wasn't.
9595,It was based on two poorly done newspaper stories that suggested the vaccine was less than 6.5% effective for those over 65.

9607,"Once the damage is done, it's hard."
9608,"I still hear people saying they ""heard"" masks are not as effective as mentioned."
9609,Most people don't follow good quality nees.
9610,Some people exclusively get information from their friends and family.
9611,That’s a lot of words to say that your belief that masks don’t work has no basis other than your gut feeling.
9612,I wonder what's the next concern after the variants are beat out by the vaccines.
9613,"Ya that’s fair too, I guess I see the point tho really I think the pro maskers want the mandates until everyone who wants a vaccine has received one so after that it’s a personal choice."
9614,pretty sure starting 3/15 you can have 150 person receptions so you're safe imo.
9615,"the guidelines for dance zones is weird tho lol

hopefully NJ is similar bc my younger brother has 250 for his wedding in September."
9616,at this rate I'll be shocked to not be fully open by July but who knows.
9617,The vatican and the Catholic Church endorse the vaccines.
9618,Vatican officials have not said to avoid taking it.
9619,"On another note, it’s important to differentiate between *fetal tissue* and *fetal cell lines*."
9620,"Fetal cell lines are being used in some vaccine trials, but they were derived synthetically from decades ago."
9621,"They’re many, many generations removed from the original line."
9622,The cell lines are what vaccine manufacturers sometimes use to test in trials.
9623,They were an asshole first.
9624,Super smug and tryna put down people for being into history...
9625,This isn't about me.
9626,"Canada's are suffering from these lockdowns, the medicine is killing the patient."

Thank you."
9631,So glad that’s how the sentence ended.
9632,They have to.
9633,Summer is probably the busiest time for performing arts and they've lost one already as well as almost a whole year.
9634,They need concerts in summer to survive.
9635,And if we're still bothered by indoor crowds then there's no reason they can't be outside in the nice weather - by the time we reach autumn there would be no justification at all for any more restrictions.
9636,Just wait 2 more weeks
9637,US Merck.
9638,That's the one with the facilities in NC as mentioned in the article.

9648,"It’s such a relief to not have to stress about it anymore, too."
9649,I wish the best for your wedding!
9650,"No idea, I just saw that this one is mostly focused on preventing death."
9651,Is going to be very important to give that one to remote places or poor countries when having 2 doses might prove too difficult for the patients
9652,Oxford actually had *superior* efficacy with a longer delay between doses.
9653,We don't know if it would apply to Pfizer/Moderna.
9654,"However, the 3-4 week they used was likely shorter than optimal, it was chosen because the world couldn't wait trials that takes months to start."
9655,Every other vaccine is given several months apart.
9656,"""There isn’t much for the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine, as trials did not compare different dose spacing or compare one with two doses."
9657,"The trials of the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine did include different spacing between doses, finding that a longer gap (two to three months) led to a greater immune response, but the overall participant numbers were small."""
9658,"https://www.bmj.com/content/372/bmj.n18

My understanding is that immunology is really complicated and no one would be able to say for sure without the data, but based on other vaccines it's is quite possible that a prolonged interval between the first and second dose would lead to a stronger and more lasting immune memory than a shorter interval for the mRNA vaccines as well."
9659,"I mean, obviously giving the two doses 1 day apart would not be good, but we don't know if the best combo is 3 weeks or 3 months or 9 months apart because it was not tested."
9660,"Weren't the ""it's just the flu"" bros preaching about how brazil had reached herd immunity?"
9661,Plus the needs of international markets especially in the developing world.
9662,If the US can produce 3 vaccines then we should be helping other countries who can't produce even 1.
9663,Thats messed up (Looks in mirror)

9673,And I don't get why they do that.
9674,Like it makes it harder on the workers and then customers will get angry for having to wait.
9675,"(not me, but I remember my ex talking about people being mean alllll the time and they were constantly asking him to pick up shifts)."
9676,"Thats so lame tho, I'm sorry :("
9677,Bloomberg tracker has it at 7% so I guess rounding up could be approx 10%
9678,Less and less as more are vaccinated.
9679,Luckily it wasn’t named specific to the year of Covid so we can just blow the dust off in 2027.
9680,Not pedantic at all.
9681,"There is a big difference between “FDA emergency use authorization” and “FDA approval.”

There are miles of distance between what these two terms mean."
9682,"Yeah it's not wearing the mask that bothers me, it's the lack of seeing other people's faces and having to constantly be mindful of distance, avoiding going into someone's house, etc"
9683,"move to NJ - smoke, and gain weight."
9684,"boom, in the inclusive group."
9685,"Trust me once you've had the flu, the real flu, you'll be getting that vaccine too."
9686,I had never had it until my thirties and it knocked me out for a week.
9687,4 days straight of fever and chills and nastiness.
9688,Yyyyes.
9689,"Yes, that's the idea."
9690,"Yeah you were, your comment literally provided no purpose to the discussion but to mock me."
9691,"I even said ""I think I know the answer"" but just wanted reassurance."
9692,That’s great!
9693,I’m also tracking vaccines and were pretty close to 20% vaccinated already!
9694,If Trump had done the bare minimum he would have easily been re-elected.
9695,Look at Cuomo or Boris Johnson.
9696,You can have one of the worst outbreaks in the world but if you act like you're in charge and handling it you're favorability gets a huge boost.
9697,Either we all keep staying inside or we let some people's lives return to normal.
9698,It's not fair but I support letting some people be happier.
9699,"2 weeks after my second dose, I'm back to normal."
9700,Idc what flip flopping fauci says
9701,The German government is going to announce another lockdown extension tomorrow until March 28.
9702,That means we will have been locked down for full five months.
9703,"And after that shops will only be able to reopen if we get unter 35/100k, which is basically impossible without enough vaccine available for ages 65 to 79."
9704,So sorry 😢
9705,"Lol it’s a girl I knew from high school, and she’s a close friend of my close friend."
9706,I don’t talk to her much.
9707,They're probably following the restrictions better than we are.
9708,&gt; at this rate I'll be shocked to not be fully open by July but who knows.
9709,"We hope, but with how things worked out last summer I'm kind of reluctant to be that optimistic."
9710,The main reason he states is changing the messaging halfway through will confuse people.
9711,Here’s the thing: reaching some “herd immunity” threshold isn’t quite as important OR useful for protecting small populations within an ongoing pandemic as people seem to think.
9712,"All it means is that outbreaks among will *tend* to die out before spreading to the entire susceptible population, even without additional control measures."
9713,It *does not* protect unvaccinated people that come into contact with cases.
9714,"If your area is continually importing cases, say by reopening to tourists from places with ongoing epidemics, then unvaccinated people still need to make sure that they are not being directly exposed to imported cases."
9715,"*Regardless of vaccination coverage* unvaccinated folks will also be at risk from secondary transmissions if cases are continually being imported, since vaccination is not totally sterilizing."
9716,"High levels of vaccination are very good for protecting the those people who are vaccinated, but “herd immunity” doesn’t really do what people imagine it will do until the global pandemic has been reduced."
9717,Unfortunately that’s not a large group of people.
9718,35% of those hospitalized have long covid.
9719,"Yes I'm aware of that, but even if it's difficult to get tested the number of tests per week or day should stay fairly constant."
9720,That means the number of cases should *not* be dropping unless they are suddenly testing less people.
9721,Man i hope you're being ironic.
9722,I agree that life has to move on.
9723,That’s not what I am having trouble understanding.
9724,Money on the table?
9725,"I mean, it sucks to lose money, but I’d rather have a great party later, than an okay one now where everyone needs to wear a fucking mask."
9726,*Especially* if I’m forking out tens of thousands of dollars for it.
9727,Family expectations?
9728,Are they pushing you to do this?
9729,It is *your* wedding.
9730,*You* decide when you have it.
9731,“Get it over with” seems like the worst reason to have a wedding.
9732,Pandemic or not.
9733,"There is nothing wrong with getting married in your late 30s, 40s or even later."
9734,"Note that this is about the party, a small ceremony or a legal wedding is of course a completely different thing, and definitely something that can be done to get it over with."
9735,The virus doesn´t respect political rhetoric.
9736,"The USA is as bad as most of Europe, UK in a complete disaster and and Brazil has ""serious"" neighbors that are similarly bad or even worse off."
9737,Go check some worldometer.
9738,China can afford this vaccine diplomacy as they managed to contain covid-19 and the risk of it is pretty much nonexistent inside its borders.
9739,The West can't since it's overrun with covid-19 and needs to vaccinate itself first.
9740,The geopolitical consequences of this will be felt for a long time.
9741,"Did any of those kill millions of people and shutdown the global economy, smart guy?"
9742,"&gt; Also, mRNA vaccines are a niche even among vaccine manufacturers

This would be better worded as ""mRNA vaccines are brand new even among vaccine manufacturers..."" because the issues come not from them being some obscure product but instead a technological jump that is awaiting a supply chain that is trying to catch up."
9743,Poe’s Law
9744,With a novel virus and a never before approved type of vaccine how can they determine what is misinformation and what isn't?
9745,Besides obvious troll posts there is still much we do not know yet.
9746,&gt; I think masks should be gone by end of May but who knows.
9747,"maybe its just wishful thinking

For masks in one of those states, I'd say summer more than spring."
9748,"They'll likely be the last to go away, especially in New York."
9749,Get a standard dose now then get a booster when there’s more supply
9750,"""They have different efficacies against different levels of severity of disease."""
9751,"Edit to clarify:

""this Corolla goes 85 mph, but the Prius only gets 51 mpg, so I'm getting the Corolla"""
9752,"If this is the science, why don't the public health experts come out and message this properly?"
9753,They are missing this opportunity big time.
9754,Why come?
9755,I wasn't trying to but literally look anywhere on this sub or thread or the news and you'll find your answer...
9756,Is there something wrong with being an old man?
9757,[deleted]
9758,You will still be able to lift donuts just fine
9759,"ok. i hope you don't get people you ""enjoy things we love"" sick because of a fucking football game."
9760,The thing is that we put these lockdowns in place and most people did (and still do).
9761,I'm very much anti lockdown but I followed the lockdown rules for most of last year.
9762,The problem is that now it's been going on for so long compliance is only going to go down - people are reaching their limits.
9763,"We've gotten to the point where people (like I said, even people against lockdowns) have sacraficed an awful lot and have reached the point where if they don't start acting on their own needs it's going to destroy them soon."
9764,"Lockdowns end when we say 'okay, the lockdowns are ending now' and open."
9765,It's only reliant on us making the decision and following through.
9766,"Also, I will say when we planned for pandemics pre 2020 lockdowns were not recommended, so this has never been done before."
9767,"I was downvoted into the ground for saying this earlier, hopefully someone can engage with me and let me know why I'm wrong."
9768,"Fauci has specifically said that the vaccines don't allow for return to normal life, and that they may still allow the virus to spread."
9769,"It's here: https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/press-briefings/2021/02/22/press-briefing-by-white-house-covid-19-response-team-and-public-health-officials-6/

&gt;So there are things, even if you’re vaccinated, that you’re not going to be able to do in society: for example, indoor dining, theaters, places where people congregate."
9770,That’s because of the safety of society.
9771,"You, yourself, what you can do when you are together with another person, we are looking at that, and we’re going to try and find out very quickly what recommendations could be made about what people can do."
9772,"&gt;One of the things that’s universal here that we know: that at this point in time, it is unclear whether when you get vaccinated and you might be protected from clinical disease, which is the primary endpoint of the vaccine studies, that you could conceivably be infected, have virus in your nasopharynx, and at that same time have no symptoms, which is the reason why we recommend and say you still need to wear a mask."
9773,"Because if you do have virus in your nasopharynx, even though we hope that when the data comes in, it’s going to show that the virus level is quite low and you’re not transmitting it, we don’t know that now."
9774,"And for that reason, we want to make sure that people continue to wear masks despite the fact that they’re vaccinated."
9775,"I'm literally reposting something Fauci said, why was I smacked down?"
9776,It feels like people have this image about what vaccines *should* do as opposed to what they *actually* do.
9777,So with very few restrictions Oklahoma managed to have less deaths per million than 35 other states.
9778,Yes in theory but I live in Indiana and there's a ton of stupid here.
9779,So many people I work with are thinking that if everyone else gets the vaccine then they won't have too.. so dumb
9780,Definitely seeing this in my own bubble.
9781,I'm about to have shot 2 this weekend but I know at least a handful of friends and family that have no interest in getting this vaccine in the next few months for sure and a portion of them should definitely be getting it as soon as feasible.
9782,"I think we'll still struggle with the logistics of getting people scheduled for another month or two but eventually supply will fully be available, distribution will be the problem, once that gets solved, it should be pretty easy to open it up to anyone and get people scheduled."
9783,It types out easier than it is accomplished but I'd hope it's opened wide for registrations in the April / May timeline and people are getting vaccinated without a wait by June.
9784,Why are you friends with such a fucking loser?
9785,They are approved for emergency use authorization which allows us to use it.
9786,You're just being pedantic now.
9787,Can we save the coronavirus sub to the internet archive somehow?
9788,Idk how that works but they should be hard archived for posterity.
9789,I assume many people who lived through ww2 felt/feel the same way about it
9790,How have South Africa's covid cases dropped so quickly?
9791,With the discussion of the South African strain better avoiding vaccines etc.
9792,the case drop seems quite steep.
9793,I read that they have been in lockdown but the case drop still seems a lot faster than in other countries
9794,What about everywhere else in Europe that is nearly as bad?
9795,And how can three national lockdowns where practically half of the year was in lockdown where the UK reached the worst recession in 300 years and the police goes after people sitting with friends in parks be a joke?
9796,"Yea, US won WW2, it's always fun to talk about winning."
9797,"Given 500k+ death toll, I won't say US won Covid war."
9798,"But if we don't talk about it, US certainly will not win next Covid war if it comes."
9799,Thanks for a quick laugh and of course for providing me with a solid answer.
9800,Really appreciate it and hope you’re having a great day!
9801,"as a senior, we're trying."
9802,everything is new and intimidating and you have to have the self discipline  to make yourself do school work.
9803,we've never had that responsibility.
9804,plus with the pandemic and the severe loss of company alot of us are depressed as fuck.
9805,"check in on your brother, make sure he's okay."
9806,hes probably struggling
9807,At least they’ve moved on from shaming people for being outside at all?
9808,"On a somewhat related note, I got a ticket from the game wardens for kayaking on a “closed river” in may 2020."
9809,I was hundreds of yards away from everyone until they jetted over to me in a motorized boat.
9810,"Of course we weren’t wearing masks because we’d accidentally waterboard ourselves, so it ended up being more dangerous for them to approach us than to let the five or six other boaters paddle around in in waist deep water."
9811,"I'm high risk, I live with someone high risk, and I have OCD."
9812,Yes.
9813,I am serious.
9814,"After a year of caution being my norm, i'm trying to re-integrate into the world like a normal person so i'm asking for reassurance."
9815,Thank you for making me feel shitty though.
9816,Then please for the love of god stay inside and let us all go back to enjoying things we love.
9817,"I witnessed an incident at the grocery store where I thought two cashiers were being really rude to each other, but once I realized that they were actually friends (and likely smiling under the masks), I started to interpret the conversation totally differently."
9818,"I don't really mind masks for now, but I don't necessarily think they're great for humanity."
9819,"Personally, I'd rather get the flu once a year (it's usually only once every few years for me)."

9826,Cheers
9827,"Between my full time job and still being in school, it'll be May or June before I have volunteer time..."
9828,"Can't wait till it's either dead, or completely overtaken by the extremes of society because almost everyone rational has moved on with normal life."
9829,&gt;As I said.
9830,"If someone wants to hold up longer, fine but when the majority of people making up 81% of deaths are vaccinated, we'll be in much safer place

Why not wait until more than a majority (say 65%) of people making up 84% of deaths are vaccinated?"
9831,Wouldn't that be safer?
9832,Haha depends on the state.
9833,Bars and indoor dining only closed for two weeks in Georgia creating a dichotomy of people who think it’s fine and safe to go to a restaurant and another group who are afraid of everyone else.
9834,Set aside for a joint venture where Merck gets in on vaccine money and J&amp;J gets even more money letting Merck manufacture on a contract where each gets a percentage of the profit.
9835,Let's not pretend this is charity.
9836,Colds and influenza spread primarily through droplets the same way COVID does.
9837,That’s why aerosol experts were saying COVID is likely spreading through aerosols a year ago before anyone was listening - because they’d been researching rhinovirus and flu virus transmission.
9838,PCR tests are near perfect accuracy.
9839,You're thinking of another kind of test.
9840,Sure.

9842,&gt; And I am sure no politician has an opinion about it but rather tries to follow scientific advisers.
9843,"Macron did, and openly aired his nonsense opinion to the press, which is why this is being slated as a U-turn for him."
9844,"Maybe not others, but for him it is."
9845,"If you publicly try to undermine a vaccine while admitting you have no evidence to back that up (clearly not listening to his scientists) , and then turn around and try to give it to the age group you were claiming it didn't work against, that's a U-turn, son."
9846,Probably not a lot for us I suspect given we’re only 2-3 months away from full supply but I suspect they will help global supply.
9847,Serious question: are conservatives not wanting the vaccine?
9848,They were the ones super supportive of OWS and vaccine development.
9849,I don’t know why they wouldn’t want it.
9850,"Depends, would you rather be microchipped by the FSB, the CCP, or Bill Gates?"
9851,KIDDING!
9852,"Pfizer has the best numbers but the difference is honestly pretty marginal, if you get any vaccine you're good and getting us closer to the end."

9854,"If it was a legit mistake and not a troll, I apologize for being rude."
9855,"But you get why people are skeptical, right?"
9856,When has the government not taken advantage of some new measure?
9857,"I understand you and others that support it don't want it around forever, but many don't have an implicit trust that it wouldn't lasy for too long."
9858,The article even points out some criticisms.
9859,A UK cinema exec says many theaters might opt to not open if implemented.
9860,The article also points out that it'd create a two tier society where the unvaccinated won't have the same freedoms of the vaccinated.
9861,Younger people are towards the end of the line.
9862,In America POC are finding they have less access to the vaccine.
9863,The implication being that older white people will get their freedoms back first.
9864,"Besides all that, carrying around health papers sounds downright dystopian."
9865,There's risk to you guys but it's extremely minimal.
9866,"There's risk to others you may come into contact with later, but it's also minimal."
9867,No.
9868,The standby lists are there so that vaccine doses don't go to waste.
9869,"You're not taking someone's spot in line, you're making sure when people in 1C *can* be vaccinated, the line will move faster."

9895,That's what they *want* you to think.
9896,/s
9897,"I mean, we saw videos where folks in China allegedly 'dropped dead on the spot' from COVID."
9898,It's not like idiocy has borders.
9899,No.
9900,If you can get a vaccine get it.
9901,"Two reasons:

1) Ensures it doesn’t go to waste 

2) Makes you one less person who can get deathly ill and potentially spread this thing."
9902,Get on that wait list!
9903,"It's not going to keep your lower risk loved ones safe if it allows spread to continue longer and puts more selective pressure on variants, causing a higher risk for escape mutations."
9904,That's why this is a very short sighted and individualistic point of view.
9905,"If it was our only option, we'd have to go for it and hope for the best."
9906,"But it is not our only option and there is better protection available, which makes it a bit foolish to take that chance."
9907,"It may take a couple months longer for me to get my shot, but it's better than a higher risk of that shot becoming useless within the year."
9908,And they do not know how effective the 2nd shots will be in spaced out more than a couple months.
9909,It doesn't  actually work like that- you don't get the same results if you mess with the timing.
9910,Children are susceptible to the virus.
9911,It’s been shown repeatedly over the past year.
9912,Any “wake-up call” would be shouted down as fat-shaming.
9913,"Healthy at any size, right?"
9914,Bill Gates is SecretAgentIceBat !!!
9915,!
9916,So they’ll most likely help ramp up production for other countries and not the US right?
9917,Since 4 months for now the country will be mostly vaccinated.
9918,Is Merck an American company?
9919,The article is paywalled for me.
9920,"You probably knew very well what I meant, but I’ll correct myself: in place of “your belief that masks don’t work”, read “your belief that anything less than an N95 mask doesn’t work”."
9921,The point stands: you have no basis for your claim.
9922,"4 days seems like a long time, may want to call your doctor for advice on this"
9923,I don’t know if this means anything but I’m the last weekend of June 100% pushing ahead.
9924,But we’re all outdoors for ceremony and reception plus several of our guests are already vaccinated.
9925,"If you read the actual article, there's still pretty significant restrictions on restaurants."
9926,And indoor venues will be operating at lower capacity.
9927,And it will really only be smaller indoor venues.
9928,They aren't filling up the Celtics arena to 50% quite yet.
9929,"&gt; including a requirement of six feet of spacing between tables, a limit of no more than six people per table,"
9930,I don't buy your asthma claim because my wife gave birth while wearing an N95.
9931,It was in an emergency situation so she didn't have pain meds or anything.
9932,So don't complain about not being able to breath in a mask until you have to give birth in one.
9933,You clearly have never planned a wedding or been involved in planning a wedding before lol.
9934,"We postponed once, we are in our 30s, theres money on the table, family expectations, the whole shebang."
9935,Life has to move on.
9936,I'm ready to be done.
9937,Yeah I’m kinda disappointed that folks won’t get vaccinated bc it’s not the one they want.
9938,"At this point, a vaccine is a vaccine, and it helps beat this thing."
9939,People have been frustrated for months about COVID - now we are being offered the tools to end it.
9940,It’s time to end it.
9941,Just hard to understand why this wasnt put in place earlier.
9942,2 months more waiting is tough.
9943,"Better than tmrw, but not great that it took this long"
9944,Well I see your point man.
9945,We’ll have to just agree to disagree.
9946,I don’t think the opposite is doing anyone any favors either.
9947,"Rocky III-style scene of Merck coming across their beaten, tired J&amp;J former rival:

*Now, when we fought, you had that eye of the tiger, man; the edge!"
9948,"And now you gotta get it back, and the way to get it back is to go back to the beginning."
9949,You know what I mean?
9950,"*

*Cue training montage, J&amp;J increasing supply and ramping up production 

*See that look in their eyes, Rock?"
9951,"You gotta get that look back, Rock."
9952,"Eye of the tiger, man*"
9953,It will become like the subreddits for TV shows that have been off the air for years.
9954,"Covid is deadly, but the vaccine doesn't have long term studies."
9955,"Cigarettes are deadly, but vaping doesn't have long term studies."
9956,"I don't agree with that thought process at all, but the people I know who won't get the vaccine immediately would just prefer to stick with the known quantity no matter how dangerous it is."
9957,'The devil you know' yada yada.
9958,Am I supposed to be impressed by this?
9959,America is blowing it as usual by bitching about the price tag.
9960,Spend the god damned money and get it done.
9961,[deleted]
9962,"Most cases don’t end up in the hospital, and of those that do, apparently 65% don’t end up with “long Covid”."
9963,That doesn’t work out to being that common.
9964,"(I also think there’s a lot of work to do to determine what’s actually long Covid - which I do believe exists, just like there are long-term problems that can happen with a lot of viruses - versus what’s anxiety, hypochondria, and other psychosomatic problems, but that’s a separate discussion.)"
9965,Isn't that exactly what they don't do?
9966,Next thing you know they'll be saying you can't cure COVID by bleeding with leaches and rebalancing the humors!
9967,"What's next, that this disease *isn't* caused by the foul miasma from other carriers?!"
9968,Scientific stances change as we get new info.
9969,"Frustrating as this may be, it's also why the scientific community normally takes time to publish standards."
9970,COVID moved too quickly for us to have good data in place so we took our best guess.
9971,Normally I wouldn't be in favor of this.
9972,But a pandemic is kind of an emergency situation where principles matter less than results.
9973,You are getting downvoted but you are not wrong...
9974,"I mean I get the US, I’d do the same... makes you wonder what will happen when water scarcity becomes more common"
9975,"Macron didn't take any decision, something that completely flies over the head of most people in this sub apparently."
9976,"The HAS, the French health agency, said clearly the vaccine was perfectly safe for all group ages but due to a lack of data, the AZ vaccine should be prioritised for under 65s for now until more data is available in a few weeks."
9977,"We're a few weeks later, data is available and the vaccine is approved for over 65."
9978,I'm just taking 1.5 days off for an extended weekend.
9979,The flight is going to be by far the cheapest part.
9980,I just need to escape.

10020,or the [German Merck](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merck_Group)?
10021,"So far, Flu pandemics of the 50s and 60s killed more than COVID (especially adjusted for population)."
10022,And AIDS has done many times the damage in deaths.
10023,Difference?
10024,How we reacted.
10025,That's the history.
10026,Good:  our technology enabled keeping the economy on life-support via internet / vaccine development.
10027,Bad:  our lockdown/shutdown insanity.
10028,It will be seen as the equivalent of giving a person a labotomy for depression.
10029,"That’s fair, we’re still sticking to outdoor projects  for now so no ones going to be hanging inside our house for extended periods of time yet but once we get vaccinated we will and I have a list a mile long at this point lol"
10030,I bet we killed more covids than covid killed us
10031,I am from the part of Scotland colonised by the Vikings.
10032,And that is exactly why I live my life is such an individualistic manner.
10033,"You wouldn't understand because you're not from such a rugged, manly, powerful culture like me."
10034,"I feel a special connection to the sea, that's why I don't wear life-vests, because I know that I am on my own out there."
10035,"See how ridiculous that sounds, I am currently sitting in a heated room working on a computer and drinking a Starbuck frap."
10036,I am not my ancestors and pretending to be tough based on them is ludicrous.
10037,Try calling the number on the cook county site periodically throughout the day.
10038,You’ll get a busy tone a lot but sometimes they answer and have appts.
10039,Tuesday at noon for cook county and early AM for Walgreens.
10040,Also sign up for zocdoc but don’t trust them to notify you when appointments are available- keep the tabs open and call those places yourself.
10041,Meanwhile in Ontario we won’t start vaccinating people 60+ until June.
10042,"Yeah, once the pandemic is done, I want it to be done."
10043,"I don’t want it to be 2024 and things to be 98% normal, but hear things like “there was a Covid outbreak in the town over, so the governor closed the schools for the week”."
10044,Should I still wear my mask if I get the vaccine?
10045,There is a choice... just call around or refuse it if they aren't offering what you want.
10046,"Yeah, Juicyjackson is personally screwing over Mexico and Canada..."
10047,"If you don't want the probe, don't go"
10048,So you don’t hear Bill Gates whispering in your ear while you sleep?
10049,Just got my first dose of Moderna 45 minutes ago.
10050,The injection spot definitely feels like a sun burn.
10051,I haven’t felt this happy in so long!
10052,Hope you all can get yours soon!
10053,"I sat here for several minutes trying to figure out a response for this comment, but..."
10054,I just can't.
10055,So I'll give a serious response and say that I was shocked at how much better my experience was wearing a KN95 mask compared to surgical masks or cloth masks.
10056,"I assumed it would be harder to breath with on, but it's actually much easier and I have less glasses fogging issues and humidity build up issues."
10057,"&gt; I think you’re trying to make some straw argument that I’m saying it’s me or healthcare workers and I’m not



That's literally what the point of the fauci masks lie was....."
10058,It WAS a concern that healthcare wouldn't get the proper masks
10059,And I stand unable to detect sarcasm.
10060,"In the UK It's entirely possible deaths could be in the double digits next week and ICU admissions for the over 80s has been in single figures

How much more data would they like?"
10061,There is no reason to continue blocking this vaccine for over 65s when it could be saving lives
10062,I don't work in hospice but my instinct is that should certainly count.
10063,The fact that your patients are at the end of life doesn't change the fact that it's most people would consider a hospice to be healthcare setting.
10064,I just read an article with scientists having concerns about covid variants becoming immune to the vaccines.
10065,This is just a bad rollercoaster ride.
10066,I'll wait for the evidence showing that they don't work.
10067,Yeah it was much slower when it was happening.
10068,It was much more like Woooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooorld Waaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaar OOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOONNNNNNNNNE
10069,I just bought plane tickets to Florida ($69 round trip from 1400 miles away FTW)  and cannot wait.
10070,"If you know anything about reaction kinetics, this has to be the case."
10071,"Smaller people have less surface area in their lungs, exchange less oxygen, etc."
10072,"Thus, on average, their infections will be composed of fewer viruses and they will need correspondingly less immune response."
10073,"For a given # of viral cells inside a body, immune cells will have higher odds of colliding with infected cells, producing again, less adapted immune cells needed to fight infection."
10074,"THIS is actual science, which absolutely no one is allowed to discuss apparently."
10075,"They shouldn't, but the FDA wants trials done on Americans, at least partly because we have such high obesity."
10076,Not sure about other countries.
10077,Very much so.
10078,I really miss gaming conventions the most.
10079,I loved PAX east because I got to demo games.
10080,I don't want a virtual PAX or E3.
10081,I would rather they just way until it's safe.
10082,Virtual concerts are also lame as fuck.
10083,Why would I buy a ticket for a livestream when I can watch old performances on YouTube with a real crowd.
10084,"This is what my coworker told me, ""there's too much bad shit in that vaccine, I'm not putting that in my body."""
10085,Mind you this guy is a heavy drinker and smoker..
10086,I was in awe.
10087,What you're seeing is a correlation but not a causation.
10088,The reason minimal Covid restriction states have more cases per capita but fewer deaths per capita is because there was no testing at the beginning of the pandemic.
10089,"The case count in April peaked at 33,000 while deaths were around 2,200."
10090,"In January cases peaked at 255,000 and deaths were 3,400."
10091,"The urban states (New York, New Jersey) had their biggest outbreaks in April when testing was low but before treatments were better and the governments sent positive Covid patients back to nursing homes."
10092,That led to low case/person and high death/person metrics.
10093,"There's also another factor in that if there's minimal restrictions people less at risk are more likely to go out and do things and get the virus instead of older, more at risk folks."
10094,I will take Oklahoma's approach over New York's approach any day of the week.
10095,Half the deaths per capita and the people there were allowed the personal freedom to choose how they wanted to live.
10096,It's a joke lol.
10097,"Obviously I would take the j&amp;j vaccine over getting covid 


I took Moderna so I don't have to worry about it anyway"
10098,You can blame individual psychology (that's the Libertarian cop out) but people have always been people.
10099,"They've always been lazy, greedy, selfish etc."
10100,Those traits didn't suddenly get turned up to 11 in the '80s when obesity rates started skyrocketing.
10101,So what changed?
10102,The system changed.
10103,The food industry changed.
10104,They started pumping sugar and HFCS in everything.
10105,Scientists in labs started developing food like substances that induced cravings by tricking the brain into thinking they weren't unhealthy trash.
10106,No amount of moral lecturing will fix what is a problem of capitalism.
10107,The fixes must be systemic as well e.g.
10108,not just repeating the same slogans to individuals about how junk food is bad that they've been ignoring for 30 years.
10109,But frankly I don't think the American people are willing to swallow the systemic changes that would need to be made to reverse these changes.
10110,I remember going on /r/news for instance and reading the comment section of a news story about shops taking away sweets from the counter.
10111,"You could still buy them, they just wouldn't be right in your face while you were checking out."
10112,"This enraged the commentors who took this minor attempt to partly address a huge problem as a vile attacks on their personal liberty, something akin to Stalinist tyranny."
10113,"To such people shorter, more miserable lives are a worthy price to pay for the fulfilment of their ideology (while also being very profitable for their corporate interests pushing these deregulation ideologies)."
10114,If you don't mind me asking what was your guest size and what city and state were you in?
10115,"The issue is compounded by the fact that AZ also has decently strong side effects, even in younger people."
10116,"Hoping that word of mouth on aches, chills and nausea doesn't kill their chances."
10117,"As this entire pandemic started from infections in China, we should be well aware that helping other countries stop the coronavirus is helping ourselves."
10118,Yeah I was reading that in Brazil if your doctor doesn’t give you a cocktail of all that stuff my pandemic denying friends have been squawking about since the beginning that the patient would be demanding it.
10119,The % of people who were getting HQ and who are getting ivermectin are very high.
10120,Good for fauci.
10121,"While people are excited about the J&amp;J vaccine, I am shocked people aren't talking about the equity gap."
10122,Who gets the cheaper vaccine that is 30% less effective?
10123,"The poor, the rural communities, the larger population hubs that happen to be more diverse?"
10124,"And as long as I'm dreaming, I'd like a pony."
10125,When I was a boy.......I had no friends
10126,Would be an added plus if they don’t.
10127,Yeah you might want to look at the Socio economic conditions of people who are obese and very obese.
10128,"Cheap, easy calories are everywhere and large swaths of Americans live in food deserts."
10129,And are regulatory agencies are captured by the same corporations that make all of our synthetic disgusting food.
10130,"It's a joke because it was almost designed to be as ineffective as possible, while doing the most economic damage."
10131,The borders were never closed.
10132,Stupid.
10133,There were so many exceptions to rules and restrictions that in some categories almost half of people were/are excepted.
10134,The purpose of a lockdown is to cut interpersonal interaction &amp; contact to minimum.
10135,The UK lockdowns have been poor at this.
10136,"In addition there were various other initiatives - eat out to help out for example that seemed designed to spread as much disease as possible, as fast as possible."
10137,A joke.
10138,"I was in NZ last year, where they took it much more seriously."
10139,I have been here in the UK since early autumn.
10140,There is no comparison.
10141,"The NZ government communication was simple, clear &amp; direct."
10142,The rules were enforced.
10143,Police &amp; army checkpoints on roads.
10144,The UK government is shambling incompetence in human form.
10145,"Their plan has changed so many times since I have been here, and they sometimes contradict themselves."
10146,"The 120,000 dead are a direct consequence of government negligence."
10147,Criminally stupid.
10148,Nine year old son with complex cyanotic heart disease.
10149,Oxygen sats run 85 normally.
10150,I cried this  morning because I don't know when we will get normal life again waiting for a vaccine for him.
10151,Do they require seatbelts in Florida?
10152,I'm so tired of waiting outside to be let into a store...I never thought I'd want to mix with people so badly.
10153,Because it's a race against the UK mutation.
10154,"For the first time in 7 weeks, cases are rising, because the UK mutation is faster than the vaccine."
10155,So it can be really bad before it calms down.
10156,Like it can be a tough tough spring before we have enough immunity for things to be good.
10157,There is a current study about the effectiveness of a two-dose regimen of the JJ vaccine.
10158,Excuses.
10159,Pathetic.
10160,Yes
10161,In Germany a stable 20% won't take it.
10162,"&gt;At this point if you don’t feel comfy coming, then don’t come, but we are having the wedding."
10163,Preach.
10164,I won't hold it against anyone for not coming.
10165,Spring will be that weird in between where events are just gonna have to be like that.
10166,"Come or don't, up to the guest."
10167,"I wanted to start doing some work around the house too, but it seems like few people wear masks in home improvement stores."
10168,"I can go to the grocery store or gas station and everyone is masked up, but home depot/lowes its maybe less than 50%."
10169,"Not sure why so different, but I've started ordering stuff off amazon that i usually would buy in person."
10170,I thought the government was doing 5g for free...
10171,I let my hopes go too high I guess.
10172,Cries in Canada
10173,"HELL NO, those fatties get the same as everyone else, can't have them stealing vaccine from the rest of us just cause they can't stop pigging the food"
10174,If only every country was a secluded island that has very little impact on the global economy
10175,"Count your blessings, up here in Canada were still under 5%."
10176,"I don’t know about anyone else, but I personally take the risk of getting a cold or flu 2 times a year over the reduced communication and connection intimacy stemming from masks 11 days out of 10."
10177,"I don’t think masks will go away in healthcare settings, to be honest the health centre at my university made you put on a mask to enter (and this was 5 years ago)."
10178,"I personally this makes hospitals, health clinics a much more depressing environment ... but I guess if they want to make that sacrifice they can."
10179,"However, masks in non-healthcare settings are extremely depressing and there’s no way this is a trend that continues in the average person’s day to day life."
10180,To say that communication isn’t hindered from everyone wearing masks is like saying a phone call is as intimate as a video call - it isn’t.
10181,"There’s more to communication than just audio, and I think it’s something that we’re all desperately craving."
10182,It sucks to have been in my state throughout this whole ordeal.
10183,For the first time in my life I genuinely wish I had been in Florida haha
10184,Hahahaha.
10185,Moderna and Pfizer is hitting capacity on the production of the specific lipids and nucleotide-related components needed to generate their vaccines.
10186,"In contrast, the JJ vaccine is grown in vats using relatively well-known techniques with substances that aren't as limited."
10187,The vaccine is composed of modified adenoviruses that are grown in a specific cell line.
10188,"Furthermore, the mRNA vaccines are much more expensive than the JJ vaccine."
10189,I've noticed that.
10190,"Now we nod at a stranger, rather than a quick smile."
10191,I also prefer the smile.
10192,In Sweden elderly may hug their grandchildren two weeks after their second dose.
10193,About that....
10194,"If you’re fool enough to believe that these vaccines will work long term, then you’re fool enough to believe that the vaccines will work on the variants."
10195,"it already has for the most part, this place is almost a ghost town already compared to a year ago."

10197,I guess I should have used /s...
10198,But the article is.
10199,"I'm from the UK, we're doing a great job."
10200,But comparing 1 dose % to 2 dose % is dumb
10201,"There are multiple potential explanations for this other than ""closing restaurants bad."""
10202,"Our peak was later than a lot of the other states, after more effective treatments came around."
10203,"Plus we shipped a lot of the more serious patients to neighboring states (I personally know two people who got transferred out of state, one to Texas and one to New Mexico)."
10204,"As I understand it, if someone gets transferred from one state to another, the death certificate is filed through the reporting infrastructure of the state they died in."
10205,"Even if it is true that Oklahoma's deaths were in the bottom third of the country, counting COVID deaths as the only metric that matters is unfair."
10206,"COVID has lasting effects on some people, plus the lack of care available through overloaded hospitals has spread considerable suffering to people who have something other than COVID."
10207,This is true.
10208,I actually saw something like this for real on a Twitter thread by a virologist over the weekend.
10209,"She was discussing certain aspects of vaccination and the J&amp;J one, which was being approved when she was doing her thread."
10210,"Some person actually did ask why we never got a vaccine for COVID-01, COVID-02, etc."
10211,"This person seemed to be sincere in that question, because she deleted the tweet after the virologist politely answered what the ""19"" is for."
10212,In Ireland 60% will be fully vaccinated start of July.
10213,I’d this enough to make a major difference
10214,"I guarantee they will start testing animals in search of ""reemergant"" strains that are sure to be deadlier and lockdown inducingier"
10215,This ain’t authoritarianism.
10216,"I’ve seen loads of folks without masks, and out and about."
10217,We are not punishing those folks or throwing them in jail.
10218,That might be bad.
10219,"If you want authoritarianism, look at what China did."
10220,aren't they still using the old pcr amplification cycle?
10221,i skimmed a headline saying something like that but didn't read it the article
10222,Ah youre scotish.
10223,Makes sense.
10224,It probably was.
10225,"We're just hearing about it today, but these aren't the sort of things that get announced as soon as execs start talking to each other."
10226,"Biden's been president for under 40 days, and it sounds like this is something they started trying to put together very quickly after they learned of the supply issues (which literally didn't happen until the 21st - the previous administration had misled them about the state of the vaccine supply)."
10227,"Also, per Andy Slavitt on ""In the Bubble"", this administration *really* doesn't want to make optimistic public statements which may not bear fruit."
10228,They make announcements of things when they're confident about them rather than offer false reassurances.
10229,Alright man have fun in your basement forever
10230,[deleted]
10231,J&amp;J is different.
10232,You cant compare both vaccines.
10233,Different trchnology altogether.
10234,And J&amp;J had a trial for one-shot only.
10235,Pfizer and Moderna said they chose to go with two in their pretrials as it was more effecive
10236,Too bad the WTO is preventing these vaccines from being generic (i.e.
10237,using an open patent so anyone can make it).
10238,Instead everyone is backing this company monopoly over each vaccine.
10239,Honestly one of the most ghoulsih decisions made in this whole ordeal.
10240,Really hope this supply bump makes up for a fraction of that damage
10241,Also the often mentioned “herd immunity” concern.
10242,Needs kids vaccinations to happen.
10243,"I don't think goalposts will be moving at all, rather we're not yet at the end of the pandemic yet"
10244,When I got my shot the other day I was bsing w one of the workers and they were saying a huge benefit for it is also dealing with transient and at risk populations.
10245,People like the homeless who may be tougher to ensure you can schedule a double shot like with the others.
10246,[removed]
10247,Thanks for confirming!
10248,I thought I had heard that but wasn't sure.
10249,[removed]
10250,I am also confused as to how these people got appointments.
10251,I'm an essential worker with a health condition and have had 3 chances to make a Walgreens appointment.
10252,Every time it told me I wasn't eligible.
10253,"They're only doing 65+ according to what I'm reading, even though their documentation links to state guidelines and I'm eligible on 2 fronts."
10254,Talk about moving goalposts.
10255,Don't know why I even bother.
10256,Have fun isolating for the rest of your life.
10257,US trial hasn't finished yet.
10258,Should be by next month
10259,You may have to disconnect from 5g from time to time to preserve battery life
10260,That’s how it was for me too.
10261,Even after the second shot I just felt cold-like symptoms for a day.
10262,However my arm was sore to the point that reaching for the seatbelt in my car was a struggle.
10263,Thanks for the heads up!
10264,I have no plans for the next few days so I should be good.
10265,"I’m kinda the same way, except I don’t like them."
10266,"I would love to wear them during flu season, and if I have to go to work while I’m sick so I won’t infect everyone around me just because I can’t get out of work."
10267,They also cover my acne and I don’t have to wear as much makeup.
10268,I do hate them though.
10269,I’d like to be able to drink water while I’m in public or at work without putting myself and everyone around me at risk.
10270,They’re miserable when it’s raining or boiling hot.
10271,Does your state require you agency to affirm your employment or are they doing some kind of self-attestation?
10272,If it's the latter I think you'd be in the clear to self-attest that you are qualified to be vaccinated.
10273,If it's the former could the volunteer coordinater write a note saying what you do without commenting on vaccine eligibility?
10274,"Hospice patients can have life expectancies up to 6 months if I recall correctly, so there's good reason to avoid inadvertently bringing covid in by getting the vaccine."
10275,"Meh, as more and more elderly and high-risk people  - the ones *by far* most likely to require hospitalization or die - are vaccinated, “omg cases!” numbers will mean less and less."
10276,I guess you just have to keep asking everyday till it stops.
10277,which is why they are approving it now.
10278,"At the moment the AZ vaccine was being approved, there wasn't enough data of over 55 year olds to approve it (according to the vaccine authorities of some countries at least)."
10279,But already then they said that they were hoping to be able to extend the use once more data was in and now voila.
10280,Literally nobody wants to say this.
10281,At this point keeping things closed is political poison for Democrats and Republicans alike.
10282,That’s the idea!
10283,This guy is anti vaccine and anti seatbelt.
10284,He trolls a lot in here.
10285,Yeah that tracks with my experience.
10286,Think about having someone drive you to the second.
10287,I should have pulled over on the way home and gotten an Uber.
10288,"If 3.8 million dosis is low to make a percentage, any sample of any research will be low for you."
10289,This is a very reasonable approach.
10290,"I'm willing to bet the ""silent majority"" of people are in this camp."
10291,Did you even read that?
10292,"&gt;Although children can be infected with SARS-CoV-2, can get sick from COVID-19, and can spread the virus to others, less than 10% of COVID-19 cases in the United States have been among children and adolescents aged 5–17 years 

It plainly says they get infected."
10293,Amen!
10294,So we can't approve J&amp;J with this logic
10295,Yup!
10296,Agreed.
10297,Our high risk fam is vaccinated and more and more are getting them so it’s really a personal decision
10298,Because of 2 reasons people don’t want to hear or know the truth.
10299,It’s scary to them so they build up an armor of pressing a dislike as if it’s a venom to make a comment untrue and they feel powerful lie HeMan.

10363,There was never any concern that it was dangerous.
10364,There was previously not a lot of data on how effective it was in protecting the elderly.
10365,Data is starting to come in now so countries that previously were not recommending it for the elderly are starting to do so.
10366,I think there is a difference in being cautious (if it turned out that the vaccine wasnt very effective on the exact population it was used it would undermine confidence as well as not prevent death and illness) and in leaders such as Macron spreading fear about a vaccine they are ending up recommending.
10367,Given his position that is irresponsible.

10417,"I have an 8 month old, and even though very few kids get very sick from Covid I'd rather she just...not get Covid?"

10419,I know them personally- thanks
10420,"But if you just look into how the vaccine actually works you can see that there's really no potential for long term effects, and the same doctors that you listen to for all your other health advice are almost all also recommending everyone get the vaccine when they can."
10421,"I can see being skeptical, but one afternoon of reading basically tells you all you need to know."
10422,And there's been people vaccinated for 2 or 3 months now with no side effects besides those within the first couple of days (which are mild and just your body producing antibodies to fight the virus).

10435,Seems like something that could have been started months ago.
10436,This should have been started the day Merck stopped their vaccine efforts.
10437,short answer is the mRNA tech requires production of lipid nano particles to act as the mRNA carrier.
10438,That isn't the easiest thing to do and you can't just build that capacity overnight.
10439,J&amp;J is an adenovirus vector vaccine.
10440,It's a far more common vaccine manufacturing tech.
10441,They even use it to make influenza vaccines.
10442,Most plants will be better equipped to make such a vaccine than high volume mRNA vaccines.
10443,Not in CA :(

10451,"Derek Lowe has written in Scientific American about how hard mRNA vaccine manufacturing is, and how it's not the sort of thing which is particularly easy to scale up quickly."

10458,"In some states covid testing was only covered through insurances, not by the state itself."
10459,Some states have better financial safety nets for those who have covid (my brother didn't get tested cause he couldn't afford to wait for payment).
10460,"How long you have to even wait to get your results (2-4 days, 4-7 days, 7-10 days, 10-14 days) will determine if a person feels like it is worth being tested at all."

10470,I mean that’s what governments are already doing in many cases.

10525,"for those on phone (the part about the new NY variant is actually very short, here is the complete paragraph):

&gt; New York variant harbors a third worrisome mutation

&gt; The coronavirus variant on the rise in New York City contains the same E484K mutation seen in variants in Brazil and South Africa believed to make COVID-19 vaccines and antibody therapies less effective, as well as a mutation called S477N that helps it bind more tightly to cells when it breaks into them."
10526,A report by New York State Department of Health researchers posted on Monday on medRxiv ahead of peer review adds new information.
10527,All versions of the variant circulating in New York harbor a mutation called D235G that might reduce the efficacy of neutralizing antibodies.
10528,"The variant ""has increased in the circulating virus population in New York state by almost 26-fold in a little over a month,"" the researchers said."
10529,"""The combination of E484K or S477N with a D253G mutation that might confer immune escape, and the increased number of COVID-19 cases associated with these variants, warrants further monitoring,"" they said."

10564,I never said that Mexico was part of the EU.
10565,I simply said that Canadians and Europeans wanted their border with the US closed permanently.

10568,Shouldn’t be long at this point I hope.
10569,But I’m leaning on getting one of the two doses since they seem to be more effective.
10570,it’s this.
10571,I work in healthcare and the amount of oversight the government has gained because this pandemic is truly staggering.

10579,I hope we are in the endgame soon.
10580,I just want to be able to see and hug my grandma.
10581,Yeah i feel for you guys.
10582,My parents are in the burbs and the only way they were able to get vaccinated was to drive an hour away.
10583,I was reading the Philly burbs are getting way less per capita vaccines allocated than the counties way out in the Styx so no wonder it’s going so slowly.
10584,I also read that the state is supposedly “reviewing” their allocation strategy now that they got called out on it so fingers crossed that improves soon.
10585,"Yeah that was pretty obvious, never thought that there would come the day that Russia and China would be a better ally to Mexico than our neighbor."
10586,But American greed works wonders...

10592,"Finishing college, working on a masters degree, jumping into wildly different jobs and careers throughout my life... all less daunting than sticking to an exercise routine for me."
10593,It’s certainly contagious.
10594,"The idea that as soon as you sit down for drinks you’ll get it is silly, like I said we’re at 35-40% of Americans having contracted it over a year, and that’s with the vast majority of people going to work everyday (the world isn’t the Bay Area, composed all wealthy tech workers)."
10595,"But regardless of your risk of getting it, the point is about the harm that comes from getting it."
10596,"Covid is bad because it can kill you, but the risk of Covid killing a young person is minuscule, dwarfed by the other causes of death."
10597,"This doesn’t mean it is 0 risk, but something like car accidents are 10x more dangerous for someone your age and we don’t shame people for driving."
10598,"For young people, the risk of driving to places is much much higher than the risk of hanging out at those places."
10599,Now you can make the point that young people can spread it to higher risk older people.
10600,"Once the vaccine has been offered to those higher risk groups, no need to worry about them as the vaccines are nearly 100% effective at preventing serious illness and death."
10601,"So even if your young friends aren’t vaccinated, they are not and never have been at any significant risk from Covid."
10602,"They probably should get vaccinated because why increase their risk of death by even a few percentage points, but if they refuse for some dumb reason that is their call and their risk is barely measurable."
10603,Great Diamond
10604,Yes
10605,"The statements I’ve read from people like Fauci, and others, have been less specific about the date, just “by summer” but it’s going to become clearer as we get closer to that point, I bet."
10606,I guess your point is that there is still a non-marginal risk of death when spending time with unvaccinated people once you've been fully vaccinated.
10607,"I am not sure if that is an accurate statement considering the data we've seen on the vaccines, however you might be correct."
10608,Completely agree.
10609,In fact is be mildly surprised if that minority didn't tbh
10610,there is always next week...
10611,"I don't mean this in an antagonistic way, but I find it crazy that there are people who complain about having to wear a mask."
10612,"In the UK we've been stopped from living our lives for most of a year, the mask is nothing compared to that."
10613,"Once you have been wearing a mask for a while, it is just like putting a hat on if you are used to wearing hats."
10614,I wouldn't be surprised if I accidentally put one on out of habit once this is all over.
10615,It doesn't bother me the slightest.
10616,"Not being able to see my friends and family, now that I hate."

10621,Why would we need masks next winter?
10622,Either you've been vaccinated and the vaccine should turn any new variants into the flu.
10623,Or you haven't and it's your own damn fault.
10624,the way the points can cross into other graphs is just funny to me.
10625,"like yeah, utah had such a bad outbreak it pushed up the numbers in nevada and idaho too"
10626,exactly.
10627,it's the same people that post about how their political views are superior and everyone else is bad for not agreeing.
10628,must suck to live your life like that.
10629,It hasn’t been built yet.
10630,So how can you get it?
10631,If your getting it from Russia what are you complaining about?
10632,Fuck that.
10633,I'm not bringing my mask out again ever after this spring.

10772,"We are however, currently monitoring the 2 shot trials to know when immunity starts to wane there."
10773,We do not have that level of monitoring on the 1 shots.

10824,That is mind boggling.
10825,I got my first dose February 4th and second dose February 24th- but I don’t take my daughter to her therapy clinic on the day that we go inside.
10826,"Being her caregiver is not how I obtained my vaccine as a 34 year old healthy woman, though I am a single mom."
10827,My daughter is also not super severe- just premature and delayed.
10828,That being said- they should have just vaccinated all the parents at the therapy clinic rather than sending people to Dodger stadium to be turned away.
10829,There’s been stories in both NPR and Latimes about it.
10830,Some of the kids there have epilepsy and are on ventilators at night.
10831,I personally don't know enough about it since it is not my field of expertise.
10832,I would assume they are taking the approach they seem best given the current info.
10833,I wear a N95 mask under a surgical mask.
10834,I've wore two masks for the whole pandemic.
10835,"I remember when people were taking the piss online because Kamala Harris was wearing two masks, and I was thinking ""but it's more effective though."""
10836,PA seems to be shitting the bed which is why I drove into NJ and got mine at a CVS.
10837,Maine’s choice to change the schedule is going to cause a lot of problems.
10838,"I went from getting it in two weeks to “maybe May.”

But the biggest problem is as soon as the weather warms up people will not do ANYTHING anymore."
10839,"Everyone is fed up, the vaccine makes them feel safe even if they don’t have it, and even at our worst Maines numbers have been enviably low."

10841,[removed]
10842,Kingpin has entered the chat
10843,Any idea when we might see cases really start to fall again?
10844,It’s been about a week with the 7 day average more or less plateauing seemingly caused by a mix of new variants and premature relaxation but with vaccinations still ticking up and a lot of optimism to for a normal summer I would hope we would see a serious decline in the 7 average soon.

10892,"Meanwhile, there's not a country on earth that hasn't been changed dramatically for over a year by COVID."
10893,COVID is unique in the fact that there's almost no one on alive whose life for the past year wasn't dramatically impacted by it.
10894,"Things like the Arab Spring and various wars and the Moon landing were big news stories, but they didn't have such a level of impact on everyone's day-to-day lives for such an extended period of time."

10905,Particularly when last year I saw both of those cavities and they were both had 100% stuff in it.
10906,Seems like a piss poor assumption that a cavity with 20% stuff in it is packed.

10921,"For example, Anti-Mask, Anti-Vaxx stuff is garbage and rightfully so should be banned."

10933,Same here.
10934,In fact my sinuses have been fucked since the mask implementation.
10935,"Deviated septum combined with allergies, and the fact I didn’t wash the mask as often as I should."
10936,It has to do with the air your are producing is more humid than the air outside of the mask.
10937,Where I live in the desert we basically have no humidity.
10938,What happens is a bunch of moisture gets trapped inside the mask and then is inhaled over and over.
10939,Either way I’m 100 percent sure the mask made my sinus issues worse.
10940,I don’t care what any of the “experts” say.
10941,Or surgeons who wear them during surgery.
10942,i think it shows how much many of the usa people care about covid and how we are handling it by opening up the economy.

10964,Last I heard it was a lie used early in the pandemic to stop people from panic buying masks.

10969,I didn’t say it can’t replicate within the GI system.
10970,I said it doesn’t appear there as its first and only detectable site.
10971,And I also acknowledged that it be shed via the GI system for longer than the course of infection.
10972,"But again, that would be during or after (not before) it’s detectable via the nasal swabbing."
10973,"But even if and when the virus is detectable in your asshole and not present in your respiratory system, again, why is this a concern?"
10974,Why does that warrant isolating someone and making them wear a mask if the virus can’t be spread via their respiratory droplets/aerosols?
10975,Is there any significant evidence of transmission via feces?
10976,Lmao and to say you’ll trust China’s judgment over pretty much anyone else because they were effective?
10977,"So should we also bold people’s doors closed to enforce lockdowns, I mean it would help with controlling the virus right?"
10978,"We could also download one copy of it, print it out, and burn it to fucking death."
10979,Your idea is probably more sensible though.
10980,Anti-vaccine sentiment simply isn't rational.
10981,"Anti-vaxers are concerned about ALL vaccines, new or old tech."
10982,"Their arguments are more of an appeal to innate notions of what is and isn't ""natural"" and are more emotional."

10987,*
10988,Yep that’s my issue.
10989,"This person is not qualified to give vaccine advice, and I’m shocked she doesn’t see how dangerous it is for her to do so."
10990,Except that withholding vaccines is exactly what this administration is doing.
10991,Read the article.
10992,The US government is blocking the export of American-manufactured vaccines that Canada has purchased.
10993,In the Pipeline should be required daily reading for the covid/vaccine curious-
10994,"Yeah, but we never did anything to enforce it in the first place."
10995,oh my god y’all been saying this since March 2 2020 lmaoo.
10996,Can we get more creative with the headlines please.
10997,That’s all I ask.
10998,[deleted]
10999,"Since COVID there’s actually a mode on the game where instead of wiping out the earths population with a virus your goal is to save the population from a virus (as far as I remember many people complained about the game when COVID started happening even though the game has been out for many years, so they added this game mode to keep those people happy)."
11000,"I dunno, I feel like the positivity rate was probably even lower 5 years ago."
11001,Seconded.
11002,There is no way they thought masks didn't work.
11003,There is evidence that masks work going back drcades.
11004,They only said that to stop Joe Everyman from running out and buying as many medical quality masks as they could.
11005,Hold on.
11006,You're saying that people will suddenly wear masks and distance until Covid goes away (which is never)?
11007,"You're right, this isn't a political issue or a debate, republicans AND democrats can't and won't live like this until they are completely safe from Covid, everything carries an element of risk."
11008,"We don't live in a world full of public health experts, step out of your bubble and realize that the vast majority of the american public is gonna give up on ""stopping the spread"" by the summer."
11009,"Now we can tell people that they can't change their lifestyles even if they get the vaccine, further decreasing uptake of the vaccine despite it's consistently high excellence in preventing severe illness, the approach you seem to like which is completely asinine."
11010,"What even is ""dangerous spread,"" it doesn't fecking matter if everyone you come into contact with has the vaccine, you'll just have a case of the sniffles."
11011,"This is absolutely a dispute I can fight, have you seen what Florida looks like?"
11012,That's incorrect policy but to claim that restrictions are not bc of government but bc of the population is blatantly false.
11013,"I like how you cast me as delusional for wanting to live my life, but you're the one that believes people will ""modify their behavior"" for Covid even with the vaccine."
11014,"Word of advice, stop reading the clickbait masks and distancing forever articles, and actually interact with the real world."
11015,Life has turned into a South Park episode.
11016,Temperance is the social movement that led to Prohibition.
11017,"I’m mocking your moralization of people risking getting Covid, while being fine with them going out for a night of drinking."
11018,"&gt;Early-mid March

You mean when we all thought this was equivalent to airborne Ebola, with people just falling to death in the streets?"
11019,Back when we thought the fatality rate was hovering around 6% instead of .02%?
11020,"Yeah, I’m sure people’s reaction to that would effect the economy, luckily we learned pretty early China lied, and that early-mid March hysteria would have stayed only in early to mid March."
11021,"Again, even if it were the plague we thought it was, what do you think is worse for businesses, being forced to close down, or having less business do to people’s own precautions and choices?"
11022,"&gt;Without restrictions the economic damage would be much worse

Florida says hello"
11023,Cool.
11024,They can choose not to get vaccinated.
11025,"They just can't also send their kids to schools to put other people at risk, and if someone vulnerable in their community dies of a disease they transmitted then they need to be prepared for everyone to come take a hard accountability look at them."
11026,"Also, since it's a matter of choice, then employers should be free to terminate them or not hire them based on that choice."
11027,"I understand that you might not always agree with them, but... orders are orders."
11028,They're there to keep you and others safe.
11029,"Last I checked, cutting back on carb intake (which is a necessary part of diet) does not cause extreme anxiety, rapid sweating, fevers, cold sweats, hallucinations, paranoia, etc."
11030,There is some concerns that the regional variants will affect vaccine effectiveness as well.
11031,"Shouldn't be a large impact, but you never know until you study it."
11032,"Some fields, like cancer drug research, have the sharing protocols like you describe, anything approved in the EU is considered approved in Canada with few exceptions."
11033,"The US typically do not do this, they say that the US population is too unique due to racial diversity and obesity rates."
11034,I think you fundamentally misunderstand the body positivity movement.
11035,It's about trying to remove the stigma from being overweight.
11036,The way society treats them leads to poorer outcomes in so many facets of their lives.
11037,Body shaming/shunning isn't an effective way to get people to lose weight.
11038,"Yeah, there might be some people on Tumblr who try to argue that being obese isn't unhealthy."
11039,But powerless teenagers/young adults in the depths of social media don't come close to explaining the prevalence of obesity.
11040,I’m not even sure 24 hour Walgreens have the pharmacy open all those hours- just the store.
11041,I started trying to get my neighbor his appointment Friday night- got lucky at 6 AM Saturday morning.
11042,Shot is scheduled to go in his arm at 12:15 PM today.
11043,"But it is enough to show that ""taking covid seriously"" or ""being a denialist"" doesnt result in a categorical difference in per capita cases or deaths."
11044,"nah, it's about 0.5-6% averaged, at least according to the UK government's estimations."
11045,"3rd time in a row, YAWN!"
11046,"Empathy must have limits, as far as actions go."
11047,"You can always have empathy for the person, but also acknowledge it's not appropriate to have X numbers of people do something just for them."
11048,"Now, finding that limit is the challenge."
11049,Two people?
11050,Fair.
11051,Two thousand?
11052,No.
11053,Doing this before St Patricks Day does not seem smart.
11054,My opinion Charlie Baker is making a huge mistake.
11055,With vaccines rolling out why now?
11056,Waiting for more people to be vaccinated only makes sense.
11057,I think Baker has dropped the ball on handling this pandemic.
11058,God i hope i am wrong.
11059,This is wonderful news as the whole world needs to ramp up vaccine production.
11060,"We're in a race with the variants and we all want to get back to some sense of ""normal""."
11061,"Plus, children need to be in school as many are falling behind."
11062,Stop making excuses for the fact that people have little time or energy due to the fact that we make slave wages in this country.
11063,The working class is the fattest class for a reason.
11064,We live in a capitalist shithole where corporations are constantly pushing unhealthy cheap shit at us.
11065,And when you and your partner  are working two jobs to make ends meet it’s hard to take the time to meal prep.
11066,Not to mention that fresh food is more expensive then cheap shit because those shit industries are heavily subsidized.
11067,Didn't Pennsylvania abolish its requirement recently?
11068,Broken bones.
11069,Broken bones that never healed.
11070,PCOS (very common).
11071,Depression.
11072,Injuries from car accidents.
11073,Sports injuries.
11074,Working 18 hour days.
11075,Lack of nutritional education.
11076,Addiction.
11077,Once you're overweight it's hard to become a normal weight.
11078,It's a terrible cycle.
11079,And lots of people become obese when they are children/teens and have nonidra how to fix it.
11080,There is no one fits all solution.
11081,Encouraging more lockdowns just makes the pandemic last longer
11082,"Mate, I am not talking about this."
11083,Or the specifics of why you would or wouldn't take a certain decision.
11084,"That is all up to you, obviously."
11085,I think you're misunderstanding what I'm taking grievance with.
11086,What I am saying is that the language used above is indicative of a certain attitude Americans seem to have about other cultures.
11087,"Namely that they are somehow ""tougher"" and ""braver"" than other cultures around the world."
11088,We hear it from you politicians and celebrities all the time and the entire world rolls their eyes at it.
11089,"We in Scotland don't go around telling other cultures that we are tougher, better, ""number 1"" etc."
11090,Because it's rude and also we obviously live easier lives than 99% of the rest of the world.
11091,What do you mean?
11092,"The variant already exists, it already is present in Europe, and it is proven that it escapes both natural immunity and AZ vaccination."
11093,"It's not gone, we don't need anything ""similar"" to occur."
11094,"It is in Europe already, and the only thing that keeps it at bay is the lockdowns."
11095,"If 60% of your population is vaxxinated with AZ, which doesn't work (and it's proven that this single vaccine doesn't), then the moment you relax lockdowns, that variant will quickly go through those people."
11096,There is no speculation here.
11097,"SA variant exists, it's present in Europe, AZ doesn't work with it, UK uses AZ predominantly."
11098,What is not helpful is denial.
11099,"Well we had a president who called the virus a hoax, the second largest political party in America refuse to follow covid protocols, and push agendas of anti science and intellectualism for decades now, and sewing distrust in factually reported news."
11100,Exactly.
11101,People are done and have steadily become more and more defiant.
11102,What is unreasonable though is that the US has significant capacity to manufacture the AZ vaccine but won’t let other countries have access to it.
11103,Even though in all likelihood it won’t end up in use in the US.
11104,Oh I 100% agree.
11105,Absolutely.
11106,I think that’s the biggest problem when I hear mask wearing excuses.
11107,It’s about your own personal safety and the safety of the people around you.
11108,You shouldn’t want to get this virus.
11109,"If masks only protected you 10% of the time, that’s still enough reason to wear a mask."
11110,Even when early on they were saying they weren’t sure if masks helped any.
11111,"I still saw all the doctors wearing masks, knew that this was a respiratory virus."
11112,Knew that my mouth and nose were the main ways of contracting the disease.
11113,Knowing that it seemed obvious that I should still be wearing a mask.

11120,Ok
11121,"If we don't remain patient, keep wearing masks and socially distancing, and hold it out until there are enough vaccinations for herd immunity, the variants will win."
11122,Seems to based on lab test tube experiments.
11123,Could be a different story in humans.
11124,And they said it seems likely to be kept to mild disease if infected.
11125,Also that masks and social distancing work.
11126,"We also don’t know how more potent vaccines (moderna, Pfizer) work against them."
11127,So it’s definitely a concern but there’s a lot more to learn before it becomes really concerning.
11128,I believe he’s referring to the “pandemic” status.
11129,We can’t call it an endemic until the transmission rate comes below a certain threshold.
11130,"yea, buy taking away the financial freedom of your fellow man who has to fund your medical care."
11131,"Income is a result of labor, forced income redistribution is a form of economic enslavement."
11132,Haha yeah let’s take my words out of context for funny joke
11133,"There doesn't seem to be any room for a nuanced approach in this sub, especially when it comes to reopening."
11134,"I feel similar to you, I'm not comfortable with indoor dining or large gatherings but if I need something at a store I don't really feel unsafe going, and I don't really mind the cold so I have met with people and gone for walks outside."

11136,The thing I can't get over is when I drive past the bars and restaurants on a weekend and they are absolutely packed.
11137,"Lines out the door, no capacity restrictions, body to body waiting."
11138,"It has been like this by me for months now, some people think that is totally reasonable."
11139,"There is ""I would like to start getting back to normal, maybe see a few friends soon"" and then there is ""what pandemic, let's all go to the bar for 5 hours saturday night"" or ""lets haul the whole family to texas roadhouse and wait for 2 hours for a table""."
11140,I don't really understand how someone can justify the latter.
11141,It will be so nice.
11142,"I also wear it when required and wear it around family too, and even those get togethers are far and few between, maybe once every 3 months (my brother in law keeps 'forgetting' his mask when we get together.. so I try to keep my distance)."
11143,But I just can't wait to not have to deal with it anymore.

11159,They also should have a second trial come out with 2 dose schedule.
11160,Likely that trial will have better efficacy  and by the mid summer the recommendation would be two.
11161,But that trial has lower dose twice so maybe not a full double of vaccine needed but 75% more.
11162,Also we dont know if people vaccinated with 1 high dose can take 2nd lower dose.
11163,Kids will be the greatest expansion
11164,I do NOT think we should treat hoarding interchangeably with wasting away in a freezer.
11165,Hoarding saves a US citizens.

11235,They are benefiting from those original aborted fetuses as much as any of the rest of us.
11236,IMO it’s hypocritical of them to pretend like there is some big difference.
11237,They want to set aside their convictions because it benefits them.
11238,I want them to get vaccinated but I don’t want them to pretend they can just set aside their beliefs and be like “oh well this is different”.
11239,That’s great!
11240,I wonder if it’s different for each health district in Virginia?
11241,They’ve been “on the list” at their county health department for a month now.
11242,There was a point in time when the science wasn’t yet settled on these vaccines and people being wary was understandable.
11243,That time has come and gone.
11244,These vaccines are safe and effective.
11245,People who still aren’t convinced despite the fact that these vaccines are probably the most studied vaccines in human history are well on the path to antivaxx if they aren’t there yet.
11246,It is time to bring them back to science or we aren’t going to achieve herd immunity.
11247,Covid vaccines are under attack from the largest misinformation campaign in human history.
11248,Any attempt to legitimize this movement is an attack on public health.
11249,"That's fine bro, if it makes you feel safe but please don't try to force people to wear them when the mandates go away."

11261,&gt; With the discussion of the South African strain better avoiding vaccines etc.
11262,the case drop seems quite steep.
11263,I don't think case counts have been that affected by vaccines anywhere except like Israel and maybe the UK.
11264,"I imagine we're just seeing the usual pattern of wide and rapid spread followed by a rapid burnout caused by some combination of increased population immunity via infection, increased distancing by people trying to avoid catching it, and heavy government restrictions on activity."
11265,100%.
11266,"As soon as we saw early efficacy, we should have used DPA to force production of 200m doses and stage them at every dr office and pharmacy in the US, so they could go directly into arms the hour of FDA approval."
11267,What an unforgivable miss this vaccine rollout has been.
11268,What children under 16 are getting lung damage out any of the other potentially long term issues?

11271,"Then why, despite decades of public education programs, do obesity levels only continue to rise?"
11272,If you have read my prior comments below.
11273,I will now explain who I believe to be at most risk.
11274,Keep in mind this is purely speculation as most medical advances are at first before they become common practice.
11275,"Obviously, old people if you are over the average age of life this can be dangerous cause pneumonia and you will more than likely die."
11276,"Second, this theory is less known."
11277,People that are over weight that ESPECIALLY suffer from sleep apnea are extremely at risk.
11278,Your body might be younger and stronger but this is a VIRUS that attacks the lungs if you don’t have clear airways when you sleep it is harder to fight this off.
11279,Third and lastly are any other pre-existing conditions.
11280,If you take care of yourselves and treat any pre-existing conditions then even with Covid-19.
11281,There is practically a slim to none chance you will die.
11282,Those that have any of the three listed conditions above and don’t take care of themselves get a vaccine please.
11283,The others can wait until supply catches up.
11284,When I see news like this I start to think many of the predictions were seeing are actually pessimistic.
11285,"“Outdoor concerts by August!” 

Why not sooner?"
11286,"If these vaccines work really well against both disease development and transmission, what am I missing?"
11287,"People will either be vaccinated and almost entirely safe, or choosing to not be vaccinated and taking their own risk."
11288,I want whole ass outdoor gatherings by May lol
11289,Malicious compliance
11290,The US has to test the vaccine and see if it works for all of its key demographics instead of relying solely on other countries.
11291,"For example, the US has 60 million people of hispanic descent but the UK does not."
11292,There aren't any variants at the moment that the current vaccines don't work against.
11293,"Yeah, but he’s telling me I’m pretty, so I’m cool with it."
11294,Is it not entirely open now?
11295,"Yeah, I had what I think was POTS for a while after having mono several years ago."
11296,If it can happen with other viruses I have no trouble believing it's possible with COVID.
11297,"Yeah what Macron said was stupid, and that doesn't change the fact that he didn't take any decision."
11298,"In the same interview he also said he was following entirely the HAS recommandations, they are the one who matter when it comes to what vaccine gets clearance or not."
11299,"It's frankly amazing how the English-speaking media got completely stuck with this stupid quote, Macron got disapproved by the HAS quickly, they made it clear that the vaccine was absolutely safe for all age groups and French media completely moved on and everybody forgot about this rather insignificant interview."
11300,"Did English-speaking media even reported when Véran, the Health Minister, took the AZ vaccine live on TV like 10 days after?"
11301,"You completely built an anti-British vaccine narrative that simply doesn't exist other than in your media, it's frankly ridiculous."
11302,"I just find it quite hilarious that a lot of old people who voted for brexit will have had their jab already &amp; be allowed to go on a nice holiday this summer &amp; young people who voted remain aren’t allowed to go anywhere unless they pay for an expensive test as haven’t had the offer of the vaccine yet 

Lol"
11303,"As a Canadian living in America, with roots in the province, I'm really hopeful about being able to visit BC this summer."
11304,Well being a big chubby or pudgy is different from being 300+ which is just purely personal responsibility.
11305,But it's horrifying considering the goalposts are moving from saying fat is unhealthy to making public opinion saying it's beautiful
11306,[removed]
11307,I hope so.
11308,All the CDC and CNN keep talking about are cases.
11309,They never seem to mention the sharp drop in deaths.
11310,That’s why I’m not going to let them decide for me.
11311,They never want this thing to end.
11312,"I doubt he is upset, probably just making a valid suggestion."
11313,"If you understood the issue, you would see the common need for both headlines and articles on the Brazilian variant."
11314,So the US is screwed
11315,"I think a lot of people need to come to grips with the fact that Americans were never going to do *this* for more than a year (yes, I fully understand many couldn't even handle a few weeks)."
11316,"Vaccine or not, most were just never going sacrifice much more than 12 months."
11317,"I've taken Covid extremely seriously up to this point, but I don't think I could have (or would have) done another year of this

Now with cases dropping and vaccines rolling out at a stunning pace, I can't see any reason why normalcy wouldn't begin to return."
11318,"I recognize a lot of people are going to be mad about me saying that, but that's just the reality of the situation."
11319,what're you planning on doing in NYC is the question?
11320,if you're looking for nightlife I think NYC is one of the last to fully open that up sadly.
11321,but for travel it'll be open by then.
11322,I'm getting my 2nd shot today and already have trips planned to FL in april and july.
11323,You have autism.
11324,Packed is not a subjective term
11325,I'm talking specifically about what the people say and do and how they have reacted to this pandemic.
11326,"And as far as South America goes, I think I would like to look at excess deaths only."
11327,I say this because there were places that were hit super hard but their covid numbers don't actually look as bad.
11328,Nah sounds cringe
11329,"Your inability to read is an observation, not an attack."
11330,"Your very sources show that the US is unwilling to give away the vaccines it’s bought, but the very fact that Moderna is being used globally proves that the US isn’t banning exports."
11331,Any company that has product in excess of its obligations to the US can export.
11332,No different than the EU.
11333,Is it a conspiracy anymore since they are openly discussing these stupid ideas?
11334,I don't mean to dump on the parade here but if there are multiple variants of this thing then the current vaccine may be ineffective with that variant...
11335,&gt;And I am sure no politician has an opinion about it but rather tries to follow scientific advisers.
11336,If you still believe this 12 months into the pandemic I don't know what to tell you.

11397,There's a thing called covid tests.
11398,Allow people who didn't qualify for a vaccine yet to supply a negative test result instead.
11399,Otherwise people will fight to take the vaccine from someone who's more at risk so they can party earlier.

11459,Canada has not purchased American-made vaccines.

11463,It was absolutely clear to everyone back in July/August that the US has purchased the first 200 million doses of Pfizer and Moderna made in the US.

11566,How about a second J&amp;J dose?
11567,"Ah for some reason I got it into my head that he'd said that specifically to the UK press, but apparently not, they were just the ones to run with it."
11568,For real.
11569,"It takes me maybe a minute to do my eyeliner, mascara, and brows (blonde with no eyebrows) and then I’m out the door."
11570,No more fighting with my foundation that just accentuates my dry skin before giving up and just covering my blemishes with concealer.
11571,"Yup, my folks are in the group - I'm happy for them."
11572,In the short term.
11573,"But they are effective enough that in the medium to long term, they also reduce spread to a level where masking and social distancing can allow a reasonable reopening of society."
11574,Or eradication is even possible if strict adherence is observed - Australia and New Zealand prove that’s possible.
11575,"Looking back at 2020, the countries that had decisive lockdowns in the spring with broad population adherence had relatively normal summers."
11576,They only regressed in the fall because measures like masking and social distancing weren’t maintained.
11577,"(The UK had one of the worst winter outbreaks, for example, and it was likely attributable to a scheme that encouraged unmasked in person dining.)"
11578,Hi!
11579,I saw this and thought of you -- https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/2/22308965/covid-vaccine-shots-symptoms-improve-chronic-long-haulers?utm_campaign=theverge&amp;utm_content=chorus&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_source=twitter -- hopefully you can get a vaccine soon?
11580,Yeah but what if I'm hiking indoors...in a mall....
11581,We are making plans.
11582,"One thing you can remember is: as long as you and your friends are safe and can get vaccinated, you will be able to socialize normally amongst yourselves."
11583,"For me, that is enough to make this coming Summer fun, regardless of how much we as a society manage to fuck it up!"
11584,"Competent people are in charge of the vaccines (I'm talking about the companies manufacturing them, not making a political statement) and we know they work well enough."
11585,"I'm excited and anxious and all the other stuff, too, but we are in a promising position: we are closer to the end than we are to the start."
11586,I agree.
11587,It is unfortunate.
11588,It’s also unfortunate the healthy ppl are a minority supporting a majority that’s too selfish and afraid of personal responsibility to not be a drain on society.
11589,The only way I’d respect the Catholic Church as an institution again is if they’d bring back the Holy Inquisition to hunt pedophile priests within the church.
11590,The difference is you can enjoy a chocolate bar once in a while.
11591,You can't shoot up just to treat yourself once in a blue moon
11592,"As the other person replying to you stated, there has been a lot of criticism of the seropositivity study."
11593,"There are discussions about it on /r/covid19 (science based subreddit) if you just search for ""Manaus""."
11594,"Additionally, there is another paper on that subreddit (in preprint), at the top currently, that discusses how the vaccines are producing CD4+ and CD8+ T Cells that react against the main variants circulating, including the P.1 variant from Brazil."
11595,"All in all, I think we'll be okay as long as we can keep getting shots in arms (and hopefully get them in the arms of Brazilians ASAP)."

11597,Honestly I wear mine so much for work and everything else that I don't even notice it anymore.
11598,"I'd have to say pants, or even a tucked in shirt are more annoying than the mask."
11599,"You may need a better fitting, more comfortable mask if its bothering you that much."
11600,I have to wear the surgical style for 60+hours a week and those are much less forgiving than the options the gen pop has for material
11601,I'm sure the American diet and lifestyle has nothing to do with it.
11602,So you’re the exception.
11603,The fact is that people by and large don’t sanitize their gloves or change them as frequently as they would need to for it to be a viable strategy.
11604,People are far more likely to clean their hands than their gloves.
11605,yay!!
11606,i received first dose late december second one in january.
11607,my dad is fully vaccinated.
11608,mom will be in april.
11609,im thrilled!!
11610,also i think some veterans 18&amp;up can receive theirs in veterans hospital
11611,"Already in beginning of April, Pfizer will more than double its deliveries to the EU, this was confirmed today."
11612,"With J&amp;J and AstraZeneca improving their deliveries, vaccinating 70% of the Spanish population is for sure within reach."
11613,"It depends of course on the deliveries and the capacity to administer the vaccines, but I would be optimistic."

11643,I would guess because they designed it to be that way.
11644,Those are just Alternative Facts.

11646,Possibly.
11647,This one is a “standard” vaccine.
11648,Makes it way more likely to be acceptable to parents.
11649,I hate it.
11650,I have some hearing loss and everything is muffled.
11651,I wind up asking people to repeat themselves constantly.
11652,Plus I’m in counseling and so much is lost in facial expression.
11653,Plus my clients are kids and I spend way too much time with them trying to hear them practically whisper through their masks.
11654,Plus I live in Florida where it’s a million degrees and I now have permanent acne on the sides of my nose.
11655,"And after all that double masking, I caught covid anyway the day before I was getting my first shot."
11656,I’m fucking done with this bullshit.
11657,&gt; But I really don't want to go back to the office just to sit in a cube with a mask on all day long.
11658,This is kind of me.
11659,"I'm in an office but only one other person is on the same floor as me, so we both wear masks all day."
11660,It sucks but I bought a bunch of comfortable masks so I'm pretty much used to it at this point.
11661,"That said, I'll be very happy when I never have to wear a mask to work again."
11662,Meh.
11663,The end of the Cold War probably qualifies.
11664,"The others are important regional events, certainly, but don't have the global impact of Covid."
11665,Mexico is America’s largest trading partner
11666,I think more than that will take it once everyone else does.
11667,Everyone get's the normal vaccines of measles and mumps and all that except for a very few far left or far right group that is very vocal and does it for the attention.
11668,I think because 250 million other people are getting it that everyone else will just go with the flow too.
11669,The country wasn't in lockdown in November.
11670,"There were restrictions, but these varied by area and you were still allowed to travel between regions."
11671,A new nationwide lockdown came into force on the 4th of January.
11672,"Yeah I was being facetious, but still, very relieved!"

11683,"""May"" and ""almost"" is sooooo scientific."
11684,My country opened the vaccinations to all the people for a while (while there was a reserve of AZ vaccines).
11685,Most of my colleagues and me myself got the shot.
11686,"The younger folks (below 40) got a fever for a day, but recovered rapidly."
11687,I'm in the middle of the 40s and only had a mild pain in my hand.
11688,"A week later, the reserve is gone, and we are waiting for AZ to fulfill their obligations."
11689,"If someone is sitting on a stash of unused vaccines, then this is going to cost lives."
11690,"New York population: 20 million, covid deaths 47 thousand."
11691,"California population: 39 million, covid deaths, 52 thousand 

Florida population: 20 million, covid deaths 31 thousand."
11692,Somehow the two states with the harshest lockdowns and restrictions have similar if not more per capita covid deaths than the one that literally did nothing.
11693,"If you don’t call that lockdowns not working, then I don’t know what to tell you."
11694,Disney world is going to have to limit visitors
11695,This has nothing to do with coronavirus.

11697,Subs such as r/news would be a better fit for something like this.
11698,Thanks.
11699,Check out NY to see how we crushed the curve last summer and nothing reopened indoors until halloween
11700,"""Why if lock downs worked so effectively did none of the countries that avoided them spiral out of control?"
11701,"Why is it that the wort hit places all had lockdowns?"""
11702,"Like I said, lockdowns aren't necessary if the governments did contact tracing right and properly enforced mask wearing and social distancing."
11703,Also you are confusing cause and effect.
11704,The worst hit places had no choice but to do a lockdown because the other measures were not properly done.
11705,There are many variables determining whether hospitals can cope with the number of patients needing ICU.
11706,"It's not just lockdown, but also whether people stay inside all the time (depends on the weather), average age, mask wearing compliance, number of available ICU beds..."
11707,I wasn't aware of the scandals in the UK.
11708,But I can't say it surprises me.
11709,UK politics seem to be in the gutter since the Brexit referendum.
11710,"Maybe there is something fishy going on in the UK, but still, I find it hard to believe politicians wouldn't like to announce victory and end all measures and get the votes as soon as possible?"
11711,In Belgium the experience has been that politicians promised to not repeat lockdowns during summer but then they also forgot to properly contact trace and test and enforce mask wearing and quarantines for infected people.
11712,So the numbers kept rising until they had to announce a second lockdown because hospitals were nearly full.
11713,Those same politicians are now trying to relax some rules here and there but hospitals are already filling up again due to all the variants we let in.
11714,All epidemiologists are advising not to relax any rules.
11715,Vitamin D isn't ignored here in Belgium but it only helps if taken systematically over a long period.
11716,"I think ivermectin is already used in hospitals for some time, treatments in general have improved quite a lot since the beginning but people are still dying."
11717,I asked why do you think China did a lockdown?
11718,Like you said the number of total deaths must have been much higher than they reported.
11719,The Chinese government isn't exactly known for shutting down the economy to save a couple of lives.
11720,They must have done it because they thought this virus was very serious and millions would die if they didn't lock down and many thousands may have already died when they shut down instead of the dozens officially reported.

11725,"But it'll be a very thin surgical mask, no more N95s, and I'll take it off when people aren't around or I'm in spaces where people voluntarily have their masks off like a bar or restaurant."
11726,"I suspect enough will be vaccinated that many people will be going maskless around July or possibly June, maybe August if there's an unexpected and drawn out slow down in vaccinations."
11727,It is also not necessary.
11728,"All that’s necessary is cutting calories, which similarly doesn’t cause you to suffer withdrawal."

11731,I can’t even get it inside of America with an essential job
11732,"Whoever says “we are never going back to normal, better get used to it.”"
11733,That's part of the bad messaging.
11734,It's not that vaccinated people can still spread it.
11735,"It's that there have not been enough studies to say that the vaccines keep it from spreading, or if they don't stop it, to what degree do they reduce the contagious nature of the virus."
11736,So people interpret that lack of info as the inverse and we get bad messaging.

11765,"I dieted, walked a few miles a day up until I hurt my neck again a month ago and I've kinda stuck at 165."
11766,Factors aren’t just health.

11768,Note that doesn’t mean impossible.
11769,"Honestly I don’t get how people ran a mile in both directions from the overall reasonable message of “don’t be an asshole to fat people, making them feel bad doesn’t fix anything”

11772,Where is the research confirming that post viral sequele is anxiety?
11773,"Congress just approved several billions to study long covid and WHO came out with a report several days ago stating that long covid is due to organ damage and physical sickness, not a **mental** sickness."
11774,"Doctors in post covid clinics are saying unilateraly that many of their patients have organ damage, can't smell stuff 10 months after infection, have dementia symptoms and sudden mental decline, are unable to exercise due to extreme fatigue, shortness of breath and high HR and so on."
11775,You have multiple athletes having to suspend their entire seasons due to long covid.
11776,"It is incredibly unlikely that people with 10+ symptoms, previously young and healthy, now so sick and bedridden, are sick due to anxiety and PSTD."
11777,Anxiety doesn't make you bedridden.
11778,Anxiety doesn't make you physically disabled.

11815,The risks of not taking the vaccine are well documented.
11816,"For someone of good health, they could easily conclude to rather take my (very small) chances of serious illness (if) i contract the virus."
11817,"This would be rational because beyond the minimal risk of serious complications, consider; 1) natural immunity is the most effective / well documented type of immunity for fighting future infections 2) vaccines have not had enough time to study long term effects (nor has any effort been made) 3) vaccines are not documented to prevent transmission; only reduce symptoms of the infected— therefore, the idea of being vaccinated to “protect others” is not the case 
4) there are known side effects of the vaccine that are undesirable, if only short lasting

Given the known health risks of covid for young healthy people, versus the many still uncertain implications of the vaccine, it’s not difficult to imagine a world where someone makes a choice not to be vaccinated— and one isn’t a conspiracy theory alt right racist terrorist believing In microchip and population control agendas, rather just a health conscientious person making a calculated decision."
11818,"I would encourage you to research the roll out of the swine flu vaccine, dengue fever vaccine, the oral polio vaccine, and several others, and then tell me big pharma and world governments “would never jeopardize your health for profits”."
11819,"Just remember, gyms and churches are closed, McDonald’s and the liquor store stayed open."

11822,God bless.
11823,Literally no where in my response did I say others should wear masks.
11824,"The question was posed ""if you're vaccinated would you still wear a mask"", and I responded, I currently do that."
11825,I am fully vaccinated and still wear a mask.
11826,I have no power to mandate people to wear masks and I am wearing one in the community where I live because so few people wear them when I'm outside.
11827,I think it's important to respect overweight people instead of shaming them because we jump to the conclusion it's their fault they're like that so they deserve bad things.
11828,But respecting someone doesn't mean pretending obesity is not an issue.
11829,"I can find an overweight person cute, pretty or beautiful, and still think their eccessive weight should be addressed/changed so they can live a healthier life style."
11830,"""Fat is beautiful"" is often frowned upon but imo it doesn't necessarily mean ""you should stay fat""."

11851,I stopped going in Feb 2020 and just wore a mask at Dick's while trying out an exercise bike.

11856,Do you think it’ll actually become “normal” in the future?

11859,"Vaccines were the end game, until now apparently they are not."
11860,"If it's about stopping bullying of fat people, acceptance shouldn't be the answer."
11861,There's no need to encourage acceptance and remove stigma about an unhealthy lifestyle that's one of the leading causes of death in the country
11862,This is why smart people don’t let the scientists and doctors talk directly to humans.

11871,"Compared with adults, children and adolescents who have COVID-19 are more commonly asymptomatic (never develop symptoms) or have mild, non-specific symptoms."

12144,"It would be sick if we did, and I would expect it to be, but think it would be odd if they started making more recommendations not based in science."
12145,I f-ing hope so!
12146,Don’t worry!
12147,I’m pretty handy.
12148,I make things so I work with tools a lot.
12149,If I'm not mistaken sporting events are already open in NY.
12150,I know in Jersey they are.
12151,and whatever you do just avoid going to any Times Square food places.
12152,shit is just a tourist trap with high prices for chain restaurant quality food.
12153,meatpacking is fun during the summer with rooftop bars and piers close by.

12159,"If you ask my fam, Trump invented the worlds best and only vaccines personally."
12160,With the increased availability of very good N95 and similar masks all vulnerable people should wear them.
12161,There is no reason not to.
12162,Learn how to fit them properly and buying groceries will be much less dangerous.
12163,I HAVE been hearing less ambulance sirens.
12164,Your stats are bullshit.
12165,"Housing, education, and other costs have risen faster than inflation."
12166,And it’s all getting worse.
12167,"If you honestly think the next generation of Americans are going to have a better quality of life than the current and previous generations, if you’re delusional."
12168,The issue with that approach is that it isnt just about preventing deaths of old people (which is obviously important) but also ensuring theres enough hospital beds for emergencies.
12169,"To be blunt, if covid was allowed to run wild, all beds would be taken up in a matter of months and then whenever someone gets into a car accident or something, they would have no beds available to them."
12170,The result is that people who would have otherwise survived from accidents/illness would die and thats no small number either.
12171,There is no perfect solution but i am sure the government has more data and experts to make better decisions compared to listening to people on reddit.
12172,Same excuses every time.
12173,How come the poorest countries of Asia aren't all fat?

12180,The article also references the number  of people who have had 1 jab.
12181,I'm not just looking at the headline
12182,Absolutely true but it seems we’re getting more positive news every day.
12183,Here’s to May!
12184,Your comment is perfectly sensible and you get downvoted.
12185,What a strange doom cult this place has become...
12186,Well now we can decide whether we want to wear a mask or not.
12187,I'm not fine with drunk driving.
12188,"I am fine not mandating masks during flu season though, and I'm guessing you are too."
12189,Someone please explain Florida and California.
12190,Florida has been open for awhile.
12191,California is not.
12192,California is worse off.
12193,I know the reasons for the aren’t black and white but the virus is gonna virus.
12194,If youre getting together with other households and no one is vaccinated then you’re at risk.
12195,That doesn’t mean we should stay shut down.
12196,That is not even close to legal.
12197,"If the Earth is legal, then your idea is in another galaxy."
12198,"I'd say they have at least thought of that before coming up with the plan, but it is the government so who knows"
12199,Flights and hotel are typical for a normal year.
12200,Guessing that goes up a lot by this summer.
12201,It would be about 30% cheaper to go this spring but I'm fine waiting.
12202,9 nights with flights for 3 for about $3600.
12203,We are talking about wearing a mask here... how is that throwing everything in the trash?
12204,Stop being an overly dramatic idiot.
12205,"This is a virus, not an agenda."
12206,"I've been wearing one nine hours a day for the last six months, honestly you get used to it very quickly."
12207,I wonder if they can truly enforce it though.
12208,I don't see any big company enforcing a mask policy and kicking customers out.
12209,I've heard a lot of people kicking and screaming getting told to leave due to not following the mask policy.
12210,I just hope this doesn't get things running wild in Texas where people think it's safe.
12211,"Also, as a parent, I wonder what school districts will do."
12212,"My daughter's school has had a mask policy in place, and I hope they continue to enforce it."
12213,"The problem is that there’s never been a clear goal

What are we trying to do?"
12214,Flatten the curve?
12215,Prevent hospitals from being overloaded?
12216,Lower deaths below some threshold?
12217,"If so, what is that threshold?"
12218,Reach herd immunity?
12219,"If so, how will we know when we’ve reached that?"
12220,"Are we protecting vulnerable people, or are we trying to eliminate risk for those who were at very low risk to begin with?"
12221,"So many questions, zero clarity on the goal"
12222,"""Learning to live with it"", means voluntary mask wearing, which plenty of people in Texas will still do."
12223,"The people wearing two masks everyday, or wearing masks outside with nobody around, aren't going to suddenly change their mask wearing behaviors"
12224,"After everything that’s happened this year, do you honestly think that we wouldn’t have been better off if we had just locked down hard enough in the beginning to get it over with?"
12225,We’re so close to ending this pandemic and you want to throw it away to go out a few weeks earlier.

12281,Google has all the information available for the outcomes for every state in the country and you can compare them.
12282,A lot of the states that didn't follow the recommendations well are doing quantifiably worse than states that did.
12283,"Even just adjusting for cases per 100,000 people you can see a trend."
12284,"https://www.beckershospitalreview.com/public-health/states-ranked-by-confirmed-covid-19-cases-july-1.html

It's also kind of ridiculous to expect every state in a country that has turned the pandemic into a party issue for no goddamn reason to have states defined entirely on either following the science or not following it because it requires community participation."
12285,"Because it became a party  issue, every state has a portion of the population that is against the recommendations and refuses to follow them, and with there being no real way to enforce it they were allowed to do that for the entire duration."
12286,I firmly believe June will be the month that things open at full capacity.
12287,However I don’t think festivals and concerts will be able to kick out the rust and spin up their gears in time to get that scene alive before fall.

12347,Given the uncertainty I don't really see any issue with this.
12348,Some provinces (ex.
12349,"Alberta) are already vaccinating the 75+ age range and the next groups are 65+, 18+ with at risk conditions, prisons, homless, supportive living workers, and any other frontline medical that haven't received shots."
12350,It really shouldn't make a difference to the rollout to only give the AZ to those under 65 while Pfizer/Moderna can be used for all.
12351,Plus Canada is only receiving 500k AZ in the next month (versus about 4mm combined Pfizer/Moderna so it's still only a small chunk)

12389,When I was a kid fast food was considered expensive so we rarely got it.
12390,However since my mom didn’t want my sister and I to feel left out and not experience things that American kids did we got one happy meal each.
12391,I remember my mom was taking us to work (seamstress) daily over the summer because she couldn’t afford day care.
12392,She took us to McDonald’s for lunch and didn’t have any lunch herself so she could pay for the happy meals.
12393,My sister and I gave her one bite each from our burgers.
12394,My mom was never near obese at almost 5’8” and 130 lbs on average and my dad was also never overweight.
12395,I don’t get this excuse of food deserts and eating fast food because it’s cheap.
12396,My mother worked two jobs for over thirty years.
12397,A full time job and a part time but she only had one day off during which she slept and I helped her clean and sweep up before she woke up to mop the floor.
12398,My dad was unemployed for about 8 years but worked his butt off after he got a job at the post.
12399,He would pick us up after school and cook dinner after waking up at 5 am which meant he was on his feet for over 12 hours a day before he finally sat down for dinner at 7.
12400,There are so many excuses
12401,You aren't helping your cause by arguing extremes...
12402,"If your contention is that masks are worth it if even only saves one life, you would rightly be chastised for it (and I would be among those doing the chastising)."
12403,"The better argument is that we had to deploy every tool we thought may help in an attempt to keep hospitals under capacity, which we barely managed to do."
12404,"Now that hospital capacity isn't as much of an issue, I don't see the problem with different states taking different actions that are reflective of the political will of their residents."
12405,My concern is with businesses opening back up I'm sure schools will be close behind with kids packed together in classes and hallways with no masks.
12406,As a parent with a kid in school (currently doing remote learning) no amount of vigilance on my part is going to protect me from what she may bring home and yet homeschooling isn't really a viable option.
12407,Might have worked if y’all jackasses actually followed the protocols back then.
12408,"But you didn’t, and now half a million people are dead and this thing drags on."
12409,Meanwhile China opened up months ago and is doing fine....because people actually listened when their gov told them to be cautious
12410,The conference is in August.

12412,I’m sorry that reality evolution is inconvenient for you.
12413,25% to 61%?

12415,Fucking idiot.
12416,"Yes, and that is a bad thing for them to do."
12417,"But I didn't do it, and I don't have legal or moral responsibility for it."
12418,Well Texas has had this in effect for about two hours.
12419,So I'm not making a comparison because it's too early to tell.
12420,I'm simply asking where the case explosion is.
12421,"If mask mandates prevent the cases, and Iowa removed the mandate, then either Iowa has the best voluntary mask compliance in the country or something else is happening."
12422,"I'm very conservative but I'm not a fan of ending the mask mandate as a matter of public health, opening of businesses is something I do support."
12423,"I'll just keep masking and socially distancing until the vaccine kicks in, smart people will do the same."
12424,Russia admitted their excess deaths were 3x the normal too.
12425,They just didn't attribute them to covid...
12426,"If they don't understand by now, I'm afraid we're just wasting our breath."
12427,"Well, now that Texas is going full Future aka *Mask Off*, there will almost certainly be fewer people come Fourth of July."
12428,"Here's an idea for you: maybe Twitter isn't *legally required* to allow any kind of speech on their platform, but maybe it's also still bad for them to become arbiters of truth."
12429,Just like staying open for flu season in 2019... oh wait... life has risks and people die all the time?
12430,What a revelation!
12431,"Florida not only already did this, months ago, but also basically ended all restrictions across the board."
12432,You still see people wearing masks out and about but it isn’t super common.
12433,Inside grocery stores a bit moreso.
12434,"The higher density the city, the more people are complying but the rural areas are back to 2019 and have been."
12435,"In terms of how many people have tested positive, Florida is basically exactly in the middle of the pack."
12436,"If it were just masks, or social distancing, or indoor dining, or any of these things, you’d expect the opposite to be true and states like California to be doing well, Florida to be doing horrible."
12437,But it’s exactly the opposite.

12455,I tried them and it didn’t help me so therefore it doesn’t work for my pain.
12456,I even tried 2 chiro’s to be sure.
12457,The dry needling they do does have some temporary pain relief (a few days) but I don’t find the value in it as it’s so fleeting.
12458,I also tried acupuncture.
12459,"It worked 2 times and then stopped, I therefore concluded that it was a placebo effect for me when I originally had pain reduction."
12460,"A regular once a month visit with the osteopath and once with my RMT keeps my pain reduced and very manageable for the month, therefore they work."
12461,The added bonus is I’m not pumping my body full of narcotic pain killers.
12462,"There is a reason why my Heath insurance benefits cover them, hint, it’s because they work."
12463,Source in Japan and Korea having worst flu deaths per capita?
12464,Exactly.
12465,Too complex for some to get it.
12466,"“We haven’t eliminated covid because we never did restrictions, but if we ease restrictions it’ll be the apocalypse."
12467,"“

I can feel the cognitive dissonance from here"
12468,I think that obesity is also a pretty important comorbidity.
12469,At some point this year people most likely won’t even have to self isolate or quarantine if they have the virus.
12470,Does anyone think people with a cold or even the flu (flu is bad but still) were quarantining and s*it before covid?
12471,Of course not!
12472,Sorry I got carried away.
12473,My bad
12474,Yeah and there is no way people that have been vaccinated are changing nothing.
12475,RemindMe!

12492,Because I certainly didn't say that.
12493,you can look at all of the per capita outcomes of the responses comparing the United States to every European country.

12523,Normality ahoy.
12524,About 200 times haha.
12525,Don’t mean to brag.
12526,I know they’re not blocking the middle seat now but what was wrong with it before?
12527,"&gt; Even when the governor removed the ability to enforce the mandate against individuals, people continued to wear masks."
12528,So it sounds like people made their own risk calculations and behaved accordingly.
12529,What uncertainty?
12530,"in addition, as we're already seeing, many American states will loosen up this spring"
12531,"Oh I’m not saying lifting all restrictions today is the right thing to do, what I mean is I think there would’ve been less of a push to do that had there been clear goals set much earlier on (soon as we first approved vaccines)"
12532,Assuming that everyone is able to get one quickly
12533,I’m told it just varies person to person.
12534,"The first one I just felt like my arm was hella bruised, but the second one laid me out for a good day and a half."

12537,And completely fuck up and educate yourself!”
12538,As the child of moonlighting parents in the 80s and 90s I can say this is just a poor excuse.
12539,My mother held two jobs for the majority of her life and only had one day off.
12540,My dad woke up at 5 am and came home to cook dinner which meant he didn’t get to sit down until 7 pm give or take 30m.
12541,We still ate home cooked meals every night.
12542,I did the dishes daily and helped sweep up every weekend while my mom mopped.

Japan  32.07

Korea  16.34

12547,yeah but most of the elder population has been vaccinated who are key in hospitilizations
12548,"But they didn’t do a nationwide lockdown: 

Someone from another state bordering  Melbourne could come in And spread it"
12549,Says who?
12550,I guarantee you most Texans were fine with the mask mandate staying until the pandemic is over
12551,I've lived in Texas the better part of my 40+ years.
12552,It's a big state with wildly  different politics and cultures depending on what region of the state you are in.
12553,Your circle of friends or even your immediate area is not necessarily indicative of the feelings of the state as a whole.
12554,"So again, do you have some polling data to back up the claim?"
12555,I don't know at what point asking for evidence of something became controversial.
12556,If by “we” you mean GOP
12557,There is literally no real world results that demonstrate mask mandates have had any impressionable impact on COVID cases.
12558,"It doesn't take much of a google search to find comparisons between various states differing level of mask mandates to see that more or less restrictive mask mandates generally don't matter to the end result - cases are generally equal and in fact, most of the states with less restrictive mask mandates have lower numbers than those states that do."
12559,This guys twitter account has been comparing states results with cases for months.
12560,"It is worth a read if you actually think mask mandates move the needle much 

https://twitter.com/ianmSC?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor

It is a low ask, sure but doesn't mean it is really doing anything."
12561,"Further, reducing transmission of viruses that are already in the community isn't ideal either."
12562,That just means weaker immune systems down the road.
12563,This is going to end up just as bad as the Thanksgiving spike.
12564,And the Christmas spike.
12565,And the Super Bowl spike.
12566,Or you could get a n95 and now your mask protects you.
12567,I haven’t been clubbing since the pandemic started.

12569,I’m willing to sacrifice some folks to get us back to normal - yes.
12570,If you want to frame it that way.
12571,"I got some news for you, you feel the same way if you understood what you’re advocating for."
12572,"I wonder how common masks will be after the pandemic, if they'll be common courtesy in the flu season like in many Asian countries or if they'll just be forgotten about until the next."
12573,"Other diseases kill people too, so I think they shouldn't be..."
12574,Most these virus's peeter out in approx 18 months anyways.

12576,"You can't bet it all on black at the roulette wheel and then say ""time will tell if this was the right call""

Bad unnecessary risks are still bad unnecessary risks even if you get lucky."
12577,Congratulations.
12578,I am really happy for you and all Texans.
12579,I’d argue the reopening guidelines set by states is a direct result of a lack of reopening guidelines from the federal level.

12589,You aren't given hand sanitizer and kid gloves.
12590,"You're expected to confront the filthiness from day one 

Also in the region with these horseshoe bats who carry coronavirus variants they're largely unaffected as well because everyone living near a cave full of those bats has just about every antibody you'd need"
12591,If the kids are still enrolled at a school district that can still happen.
12592,The ones we're discussing here de-enrolled from their previous school district and may have enrolled somewhere else or not.
12593,"The state can only work at the speed of the data it has, and a lot of independent schools (or even more rural school districts) can be slow to provide new student enrollment data."
12594,"Some school districts do ask for ""next school."""
12595,"but unless it is another school within a state school district, it can often be hard to consolidate (i.e."
12596,it is junk).
12597,"As to calls Vs. letters, the state may not even have a *current* phone number on file."
12598,Even a lot of letters are return-to-sender because the missing kid's parents moved (both inter-state and out of state).
12599,&gt;What is everyones take on masks staying around for awhile?
12600,"I think the s.m.r.t people (like all of us) will continue to wear them when in public setting such as the grocery store, gas stations, etc."
12601,Once I'm fully vaccinated the masks go on the bonfire
12602,Damn.
12603,"I scheduled my 2nd today, thinking maybe I should have opted for an earlier appointment then 2PM..."
12604,"Once eradication is achieved, these nations have kept themselves protected by closing their borders to everyone until they have completed a mandatory two week quarantine, which prevents any superspreader events from occurring and removes any concerns about inaccurate testing."
12605,Did I avoid people when I was sick before 2020?
12606,"Yes, I did."
12607,Texas has entered the chat.
12608,not just sars or mers but fuuuuulllll blooooown covid

12615,&gt;Except anti-vaxxers and all the people that the virus kills before they even have a chance to get the vaccine.
12616,Nobody who died on D-Day will be getting the vaccine either.
12617,"It's crazy that most of the CA population still supports him, and a good amount of them want even more restrictions for some reason."
12618,"I have this bad gut feeling that masks are going to be around for a long, long time here."
12619,Hopefully I'm wrong.
12620,You're still allowed to wear a mask if it makes you feel safer.
12621,Somebody is super optimistic.
12622,I live in Texas and think we're fucked but hope you're right.
12623,I see a spike in hospitalizations soon with it eventually decreasing when vaccine quantity actually meets demand.
12624,This just confirms I'm going to avoid public more than I already do.
12625,I'm not willing to go back to grocery stores with 50% mask rates.
12626,This is they way.
12627,You think there’s anything wrong with that?

12635,I’m totally on the fence to lockdown.
12636,"I am itching for it to end, but I am extremely worried we’ll regress and jeapordize the summer."
12637,If we keep up what we’re doing now until the general population is able to begin getting the vaccine I think we’ll be fine.
12638,"But it really does feel like these next few weeks is the last hump until summer, and I’m so worried we might fuck up on the home stretch."
12639,This is an area where leaders are supposed to ***LEAD***.
12640,"Not follow behind their constituents because their constituents, or any politicians constituents, are not infectious disease experts."
12641,cool they can wear a mask still
12642,Just fine means deaths/hospitalizations will continue to decline.
12643,"I suppose time will tell, but I think this is the right call to make."
12644,Uhh...
12645,I'm not sure you know how to interpret data...
12646,"I agree, we need more clarity on what the goal is and when we could expect to be able to safely lift restrictions."
12647,That has been a massive failure in leadership.
12648,"But this article is interviewing experts in virology, public health, and infectious disease who are warning that their research shows a risk of another surge in transmission and death if restrictions are lifted now."
12649,"They aren’t setting the goal, nor is it their job to, but they are suggesting that holding onto restrictions a bit longer could save lives."
12650,I don’t think we should disregard that because some people misinterpreted the 2 week quarantine as a definitive fix.
12651,Outdoors transmission is extremely rare.
12652,I really have no problem with beaches being open.

12692,Of all the first world nations Japan and Korea have by far the worst influenza deaths per capita of any of them.
12693,If masks were so effective they should have an effect on the two places were usage was a cultural norm (SK and Japan).

We can argue about what “reasonable” is, but I don’t understand how people are okay with there being no metrics or criteria for lifting restrictions in the majority of states

12742,Texas was on our list.
12743,Glad we didn't go there.
12744,Didn't they say a few weeks ago it doesn't?
12745,New zealand says hello.
12746,Iceland says hello.
12747,[removed]
12748,It's what the people want.
12749,The government represents the people.
12750,This doesn't stop anyone from wearing masks if they still want to.
12751,This really doesn't change anything except the incrimination of those who don't wear masks.
12752,My wife and I had traveled to Europe for the previous three years and twice in 2019.
12753,We're so ready to GTFO.
12754,[removed]
12755,There's no explaining the low deaths though... Clearly Japan didn't get hit as hard as most of the West by the virus.
12756,"Maybe it was just luck, who knows"
12757,Greg Abbott opened Texas too soon and caused a skyrocket in cases.
12758,He failed then.
12759,Greg Abbott failed about every response so far during COVID and even failed with the power outages from the winter storm and his response to it.
12760,Greg Abbott will fail with this.
12761,GOOD LORD SOMEONE HELP US IN TEXAS
12762,"No, not officially."
12763,"The majority of california is still purple tier, which means no indoor dining."
12764,"However, more and more restauranteurs are declaring ""to hell with the restrictions"" and opening at full capacity in defiance of the order, and the state is doing fuck-all to stop them."
12765,"Same with gyms, some smaller movie theaters too."
12766,The lockdown on paper looks quite a bit different from the lockdown in real life.
12767,Really the only things you can't do right now in California are go to a sporting event or ride a rollercoaster.
12768,Lol there is 0 chance states outside a few conservative ones lift all mandates around May.
12769,0 chance
12770,"People always say this when a state fully reopens, yet they always end up following the exact curve as all the other states regardless of restrictions."
12771,Removing the mandate absolutely gives anti maskers the ability to stop wearing masks in public places.
12772,"People can obviously still choose to wear them, but the mandate is necessary for a bit longer to have the shortest duration of this whole mess."

12775,This March will hopefully be the opposite of last March
12776,"If we have learned any lesson from this, it's that roughly half the country will tell you that 2+2=Green with a straight face if they can make a wedge issue out of it."
12777,Agreed.
12778,"Remember last may/june when Texas reopened early, declared it a huge success, then had to close up again when it blew up in their face?"
12779,Because Texas doesn't.
12780,I thought HEB already wasn't stopping maskless customers because of danger to employees or something?
12781,You’ll have some other reason to infringe on other’s rights in a couple months I’m sure

12783,[removed]
12784,"&gt;But for what ever reason people lose their dang minds when they are forced to eat their favorite restaurant’s food at their own dinner table instead of someone else’s

Some people, yes."
12785,"But someone's been putting a lot of money into the pockets of companies like DoorDash and Uber Eats, so it's not everybody."
12786,"I personally could go another year without stepping foot in a reastaurant, I've always preferred eating at home."
12787,Wearing a mask is a small harmless action.
12788,And we need everyone to do it to save lives.
12789,People dying from the flu is still a crisis.
12790,Sad that you apparently see saving lives as a bad thing.
12791,Lack of social distance and being indoors is a risk factor.
12792,Good.
12793,The locals going to the park every weekend inflate the crowds in a bad way.
12794,"Most parks that have managed to open are actually seeing a rise in profitability due to the fact that smaller crowds in the park means people spend less time in lines and more time on the midways, buying food, drinks and merch."
12795,"A talk I was able to have (enthusiast event) with the president of a Texas amusement park a month or so ago mentioned that even though attendance was dead during the summer, they managed to make about the same amount of money as during normal summers."
12796,"Everyone wants to play the doomsday card, but Florida has been this way for a long time and it’s numbers are no worse then NY or CA."
12797,"Everyone thought cases would spike after celebrations in Tuscaloosa, but they dropped like a rock."
12798,Let’s wait and see before saying it’s a horrible decision.
12799,"If it goes well, hopefully other states do the same."
12800,We are adults.
12801,It has been a year.
12802,We can’t stay locked down forever.
12803,I am in Florida right now and it is great that everything is open even with restrictions.
12804,It comes down to personal responsibilities.
12805,"I wear my mask all the time, wash my hands, keep my distance and I have been able to live relatively normally (restaurants, parks, etc)."
12806,"Even when I am vaccinated, I will continue to do that for a while."
12807,I do avoid crowded places where people don’t respect basic mask wearing or distance.
12808,I stopped going to businesses that don’t care about masks.

12810,"**Time to abandon the hygiene hypothesis: new perspectives on allergic disease, the human microbiome, infectious disease prevention and the role of targeted hygiene**

Basically, it says that microbial exposure (what they call ""Old Friends"") is crucial to strengthening immune system."
12811,"They provide examples such as having pets at home, being raised in a farm, and having lots of siblings linked to less allergies."
12812,"The authors point out how hygiene hypothesis is a misleading word, as hygiene in the public speech is different than the hygiene academics meant."
12813,"They actually point out how it's unlikely that exposure to viruses makes us stronger, evolutionarily speaking."
12814,"What the hygiene hypothesis *academically* meant was that we shouldn't sanitise everything to the point it's sterile, and that microbes are actually good!"
12815,"But most people read ""hygiene hypothesis"" and were like ""hygiene bad!"""
12816,"which is not the case: you want some dirt, but not a lot, and you don't necessarily want to be exposed to pathogens."

12828,What do you mean how many times does this need to happen?

12851,Good.

12853,God I remember reading news coming out of China that it wasnt going well and then trump was saying it was nothing more than flu.... it doesnt take a genius to realize we dont hear about it from China if it is just the flu.
12854,That's when I knew it was gonna go to shit.
12855,Missing the context that presumably people under the guidance of this Archdiocese can still get vaccinated by the mRNA vaccines to avoid the moral compromise.
12856,"Short sighted of course due to limited supply of all vaccines, but eventually one supply goes up, this will be a non-issue."
12857,"I did some research just cause I'm curious for the rationale (not that I agree with it), but it's apparently because the J&amp;J vaccine uses the HEK cell line (originated from an elective abortion in the Netherlands) in the production of its vaccines whereas the mRNA only used the cell lines to test the vaccine."
12858,"I only state this to provide the context that there is a ""rational"" explanation for why the J&amp;J vaccine is not morally equivalent to the Moderna/Pfizer vaccines to many Catholics."

12874,Nothing about the idea of people doing what they consider to be a small harmless action to save lives makes me mad.
12875,Just don't mandate it when the crisis has passed.
12876,There's a difference between people doing a thing and making the doing of that thing *mandatory.
12877,*
12878,"What would removing the mask mandate have to do with ""learning to live with it""?"

12883,"Summer starts in mid-June and ends in September, so that surge happened in late spring and the majority of the summer season saw a noticeable drop in cases."

12922,You can open things up and wear a mask at the same time.
12923,It’s like saying I can’t go to target because I have to wear pants.

12957,So you’re describing yourself?
12958,I’m confused as to why you think my comment doesn’t include you in the “people”.
12959,I’ll go with the controversial take.
12960,“Long covid” isn’t so much a diagnosis but an umbrella term for a million different things.
12961,Some percentage of those things very curiously mimic the symptoms of anxiety.
12962,"I’m just saying, it wouldn’t be surprising if some of those symptoms mysteriously disappear after an event that basically means “covid is over” for the person with the symptoms."
12963,The problem will solve itself.
12964,A more contagious strain also means that  people acquire immunity via infection faster.
12965,how much longer should we quarantine for then?
12966,Yes I agree with you.
12967,"Hopefully vaccinations against the variants can be administered on a greater scale, before the texas effect starts spreading"

12973,"If things get out of control, it'll be too late to shut stuff back down without massive costs to human life

If the decision was based on facts, science and numbers they would not have reopened everything but instead gone with a gradual reopening process that could be carefully monitored."

13046,"No one is going to read that sentence and go ""Yes, I understand what he's trying to say and he is saying that since the Big Ten had no fans in attendance and the SEC had 20% or 25% capacity, that by comparison we should call that 'packed.'"""
13047,"No, man."
13048,Packed means packed and SEC stadiums were not packed this past season.
13049,So proud of my tiny town!
13050,"SciShow did an episode on this, c and basically compared it to not finishing your course of antibiotics."
13051,"You have a good amount of immunity, but potentially not complete immunity, evidenced by the lower efficacy rate."
13052,So some more resistant virus may survive.
13053,"If this is widespread, say because you're vaccinating an entire population this way, you're potentially having lots of chances for this selection pressure to produce a vaccine resistant strain."
13054,"Incidentally Podcast 19 did an episode on how the variants may have come into circulation and a doctor hypothesized it may be due to immunocompromised individuals catching Covid, mostly fighting it off, but not entirely."
13055,The ones that left are slightly more resistant to anti bodies.
13056,"They grow back in the individual, rinse, repeat this cycle, until you've selected for a more resistant strain, then is spread."
13057,Now I'm more than willing to be corrected on this if my understanding is wrong.
13058,Here is the hard truth: Americans are more individualistic than a lot of countries would like.
13059,"We are told from a young age that we are personally responsible for our own health and safety, that we need to be tough, stand strong, and get ahead."
13060,"Mind our own business, take care of our own."
13061,"Do you realize 500k of us are dead, variants are gaining steam, and people in Florida, where I live, are still out and about like nothing is happening?"
13062,Businesses are 100% open.
13063,Americans who know better want strong self-protection because we are largely on our own.
13064,"Mask wearing is falling out of favor, too many people don’t want any kind of vaccine, and if we get sick or lose our jobs, we are out on our asses."
13065,"So no, you won’t find a lot of support for watering down vaccines to save a few infections, especially when the vaccines will flow like water in a matter of months."
13066,We have already been at this for a year!
13067,"When our turn comes, we want to feel like fully armored knights on a battlefield, not people cautiously tip toeing around."
13068,That’s what is expected of us.
13069,That’s what has been expected of us our entire lives.
13070,If I'm not mistaken though that's because it was only tested with one dose to get to market sooner because it's so desperately needed.
13071,I could be wrong but I understood that it's being looked into whether a second dose increases it's effectiveness and it could later change to a 2 dose vaccine depending on results.
13072,Hopefully.
13073,I want to sit on a beach in Mexico drinking beer until I pass out.. then do it again the following day.
13074,"Until then, I will keep my mask on and social distance until this happens!"
13075,What is everyones take on masks staying around for awhile?
13076,"I think the s.m.r.t people (like all of us) will continue to wear them when in public setting such as the grocery store, gas stations, etc."
13077,I thought the government explicitly said they were no longer holding back second doses in January?
13078,&gt; I find it ridiculous it took this long to open up sporting venues.
13079,"At 12% capacity, there is no reason they can’t social distance

There's the seats and then there's everywhere else."
13080,"But they could take other steps to deal with things like that, like maybe keeping concession stands closed and only have the traveling vendors."
13081,Just around the corner.
13082,Any minute now.
13083,Hurricane incoming
13084,Wanting to see faces is literally the opposite of weird.
13085,Empathy doesn’t mean what you think it means in this context  - why is my right to a nice day at the beach less important than that family’s paranoia?
13086,Agreed.
13087,"In the meantime there are months yet to go before us ""regular"" folks can get vaccinated in the USA."
13088,"i don't think i've met any anti-vax pro-mitigation people IRL yet, but yeah anyone who is anti vax will soon be irrelevant and anyone anti-mitigation will also be irrelevant soon as well."

13097,Hopefully we get some studies soon.
13098,This is US Merck.
13099,«These data highlight the prospect of reinfection with antigeni- cally distinct variants and foreshadows reduced efficacy of spike-based vaccines.»
13100,Your sister?
13101,We are in California but I feel this rollout has failed to protect vulnerable children and people with disabilities like Down syndrome nationwide.
13102,The cdc didn’t even add Down syndrome as a condition that worsened outcomes until December.
13103,If it is your sister trying to get the vaccine she should be recognized nationwide as the healthcare provider that she is.
13104,The difference is that Covid has no staying power.
13105,Nothing will be dramatically different in the world’s balance of power or day to day life.
13106,"We barely talk about The Spanish Flu, covid will be the same."
13107,why were all the headlines yesterday slight uptick in cases?
13108,Maybe backlog?
13109,It's not cheap.
13110,The company is just charging less for it.
13111,It seems the UK is having really good success with it.
13112,I'm surprised some in the EU haven't backtracked their negative view towards it.
13113,Just FYI you can wear an N95 mask and protect yourself everywhere instead of relying on others wearing a mask.
13114,Remember that regular cotton masks that most people wear are not doing a good job in the first place.
13115,This week
13116,"We’re in South Carolina, so full sized weddings have been happening since last May."
13117,We had about 100 guests.
13118,This has nothing to do with vaccines and we already know plasma isn't very effective.
13119,For real.
13120,"Do you know how many times the governor of Florida, who abandoned us to fend for ourselves (no mask mandates, broken unemployment system) told us it was our “personal responsibility” to stop the virus."
13121,As if I have any control of an airborne virus while shopping at f’n grocery store.
13122,I guess it’s my fault for not being rich and building a personal bunker years before the virus happened.
13123,Im not saying I agree with this highly individualistic mentality.
13124,I’m saying that’s the standard we are *being held to*.
13125,Which means you act accordingly or your family goes hungry.
13126,People want to understand why we want two shots of Pfizer/Moderna?
13127,"Well, they would understand it if they have ever received a medical bill they can’t pay!"

13134,"Because if what he says is right, it means we spent a year in lockdown waiting for a vaccine for nothing, because now he’s saying that nothing has changed even with the vaccine."
13135,"So our choices are stay like this forever or learn to live with the virus, and for the majority that want to move on, apparently we could have started doing that a long time ago since the vaccines according to Fauci are pretty useless."
13136,Fauci has admitted to lying to the public before to get us to do what he thinks is best and I think he’s doing it again.
13137,He’s telling people vaccines don’t stop spread so people won’t go out and party before everyone has had the shot.
13138,I don’t understand why people worship him.
13139,"For the vast majority if children and adults, the virus is not a threat or that dangerous."
13140,"Serious cases in adults and children, as well as long covid, are a major statistical minority."
13141,"Once the risk groups, which are the only people this virus is really a significant threat to, are vaccinated, we can open up and co tinue vaccinating the rest while handling the small fringe cases of others catching it, like we do with other diseases."
13142,There is government financial support in place.

13147,"I mean, you are the one using Israel as evidence that the vaccines don't work on the variant, and I already showed you evidence that contradicts your lie."
13148,"My sister is getting married in April, full steam ahead."
13149,"My county has had 2 to 3 cases reported in the last few days, and we are also kicking ass in vaccinating."
13150,"At this point if you don’t feel comfy coming, then don’t come, but we are having the wedding."
13151,"Pretty sure salk polio vaccine(the one we use now prevents transmission), pertussis, flu vaccine, the majority of livestock vaccines are leaky I believe."
13152,There are others I can’t remember off the top of my head but the majority of vaccines we get provide sterilizing immunity to my knowledge
13153,I’ve taste some terrible breads that feels like tires.
13154,/s
13155,Antivaxxers can suck it frankly.
13156,I'm not stopping my life for another year because they won't listen to science.
13157,Its people like that who made this as bad as it is in the first place.
13158,"After a few months of vaccines being available to the general public, if they had a chance to get vaccinated but didn't... that's frankly on them."
13159,They had a choice.
13160,"As for kids, it appears there are some vaccines being tested for children."
13161,Hopefully once those are approved they are required for kids to go back to school/are provided for free at the school so fewer children are negatively impacted by their imbecile parents.
13162,"I prefer to look at total % of adult population X 2 doses, and currently we are at 15.1%."
13163,"By the end of March, with the addition of J&amp;J, the U.S. should be able to double that number (30%+) - approximately 2,300,000 doses administered a day."
13164,It will take another 3 months (or less) to get to 75-85% of the entire adult population.
13165,I know I’m getting burnt out when this comment made me cry.
13166,The thought of returning to something closer to life before sounds so amazing and surreal...
13167,I can’t wait to get the vaccine
13168,That data came out with the initial Pfizer data when it was first approved.
13169,We don’t have any data on people who never received the second shot but among people who received both shots the vaccine was nearly fully effective at preventing symptomatic infection within 2 weeks of the first shot (before ever receiving the second shot).
13170,Hard to put the toothpaste of authoritarianism back in the tube
13171,That’s dumb.
13172,Why?
13173,"The vaccine means you might not even get it, or if you do, it’ll be light."
13174,"There’s folks around the globe waiting for vaccines, but here you are, throwing a fit because you’re not getting the ~right~ vaccine."
13175,All the warmth/droplets give me acne
13176,Stay positive guys
13177,I can't even imagine how expensive and packed every place will be after mid 2021
13178,&gt;but you'll never really control others around you.
13179,We built this country on that exact principle.
13180,"well, except for slavery and our treatment of indigenous people and internment camps."
13181,"Those were pretty thoroughly about controlling others around you, so I don't know if we can hold America up as a shining example of personal liberty and respecting other people's rights."
13182,NJ has been easing up though.
13183,I signed up for appointment alerts for one of the mega sites in January.
13184,I took no further action.
13185,I didn't hunt for appts.
13186,I just waited until I got my email from them letting me know appointments were available.
13187,I get my second shot next week.
13188,"The rest of my immediate family (all in NJ) is also either fully vaccinated or getting their second shot soon, too."
13189,There's light at the end of the tunnel in NJ even if you don't want to put in a lot of effort.
13190,I am hoping abbott lifts restrictions today in Texas.He is about to speak this afternoon
13191,"That’s why I’m most excited about vaccination, just the peace of mind that even if I do get it, there’s a far slimmer chance it will kill me or give me lasting damage."
13192,"I spent two days in SD a couple years back and we went to Balboa Park both days, I can't wait to go back."
13193,"Went to a bunch of museums, it was so fun."
13194,I certainly hope so because it's not cheap.
13195,[removed]
13196,People who have done the strategy of getting a vaccine by taking the extra doses to keep them from going to waste: what sites did you use?
13197,Retail pharmacy?
13198,Chain?
13199,Doctor's office?
13200,"Woah, yeah that's gotta be weird for kids who are super young, all they must know is the quarantine"
13201,"they are really really tight and fuck yea i have photos, head over to my onlyfans to check them out"
13202,And how much effect did any of that have on the day to day life of the average person not living near the Arab world?
13203,Not nearly as much as COVID.
13204,Flu shots are a regular occurrence that pharmacies **are** designed and prepared to handle.
13205,"Emergency use vaccines with currently unpredictable supply chains and highly sensitive temperature requirements, that need to be distributed as fast as humanly possible are **not** something that pharmacies are designed or prepared to handle."
13206,"&gt;social distancing measures 

The most effective social distancing measures are ones aimed at large gatherings, most of which probably won't be happening until late summer and fall in most places."
13207,The hookah variant
13208,Experts agree the pandemic and shutdowns were highly political.
13209,Sorry you are miss informed.
13210,Yes that’s so fantastic.
13211,Brings me joy to know the UK accomplished that level of vaccination for the elderly.
13212,Great work.
13213,I see this in certain subreddits.
13214,"We know outdoor transmission hasn’t been a thing for a LONG time and people still complain “omg, people at the park didn’t have masks!”"
13215,"Call around to all your nearest pharmacies and ask for a ""no waste list"", they are different from the regular list."
13216,"I went to a Meijer near the end of the day and was like ""hey do you have any left overs you need to get rid of"" and they had a couple left and I was able to get one after everyone that was scheduled to get one either got it or cancelled earlier in the day."
13217,Canadians and Euros... never knew Mexico was part of the EU.
13218,We’ve been doing as bad as y’all since the start and so has been the case in Latin America.
13219,But that doesn’t change the simple fact that we bought our vaccines and America is prohibiting exportation for the vaccines that we bought.
13220,Hold off for 2 to 3 more months before allowing life to go back to full 2019 normal?
13221,Reasonable.
13222,"Hold off for 2 to 3 more months and only then ""begin to reopen safely?"""
13223,Insane.
13224,Yes by a significant amount.
13225,Surely a sign of the new J&amp;J vaccines “hitting the shore”.
13226,I remember this subreddit laughed when I said we could see 3MM by the end of March and here we’re doing nearly double that on the second day of March.
13227,The USA is about to cancel the 2021 Season of the Pandemic it looks like.
13228,Holy cow.
13229,Edit: just saw this DOESNT include J&amp;J yet.
13230,The only thing you can say is WOW.
13231,I do agree but you know what I've missed doing just in day-to-day?
13232,"My partner and I used to go sit at the food court in the mall and I'd sometimes draw, and we'd people watch while we ate lunch."
13233,There's too many stupid folks around in our state to feel safe enough to do so.
13234,"I know it's paranoid, but we have pets with poor respiratory systems, and neither of us can really afford to take the time off work."
13235,That's me.
13236,Shit blows.
13237,"Some do, some don't."
13238,Just like everywhere.
13239,"There are more Trump voters in California than Texas, in case you're trying to argue that it's a monolithic state."
13240,And they had large anti-mask protests and anyone in a college town can tell you about the party houses that have been going strong all year.
13241,Give it enough time for those that want the vaccine to get it.
13242,Simple.
13243,Plus unvaccinated still have to go to work and get groceries so wear the mask whatever your feeling are at those places.
13244,Hang in there - we're almost there!
13245,"It's still a risk that needs to be considered when advocating for first doses first strategy, especially if you're going to say the risk has proven to be worth it."
13246,"You're also putting a lot of stake into mitigation strategies, after a year of evidence that shows how resistant people are to mitigation strategies."
13247,Pretty amazed I made it through this whole winter without getting sick.
13248,Then again I only leave my house once a week for 1 hour to get groceries and have been WFH since last March....
13249,[removed]
13250,Not anymore.
13251,;)
13252,"And alcohol worsens anxiety, it’s one big shit circle."
13253,Well if you say so.
13254,🤣🤣 I think this whole “kindness and empathy” thing has been now taken way too far.
13255,"There are limits to kindness and empathy, especially when it’s literally indulging nonsense craziness."
13256,Not my problem.
13257,"damn, i always forget my opening of Genesis."
13258,"Sun was 5th day, bleach was 6th, executive time on the 7th?"
13259,"We were in the twiddling thumbs phase until the vaccines hit, regrettably."
13260,Could people not just start driving/flying in and cause a massive backlog?
13261,Wasn’t that also around the time we really started marching full steam ahead to a service economy?
13262,"The only times as an adult I’ve been fairly fit were a period where I worked out regularly, when I worked on a farm, and when I worked in a restaurant on my feet all day."
13263,"The mental slog of an 8-5 job, plus a commute, plus cooking, chores, socializing, etc leave me drained."
13264,The last thing I want to do is something that feels like another chore.
13265,It was easy to be healthy when constant movement was part of my day.
13266,It didn’t require much discipline beyond showing up for work.
13267,"That’s what I see in the office world at any rate: people with strong discipline for exercising stay rather thin, people lacking it pack on the pounds."
13268,"And yes I know there are medical reasons for some peoples’ weight gain, that’s not what I’m addressing."
13269,"On top of that, our built environment doesn’t help."
13270,"In most of the US, people get in their cars for just about every trip out of the house."
13271,"*looks around* 
  
Rational?"
13272,I would say less surprised and more relieved.
13273,You have to keep in mind that vaccines which prevent disease but do not reliably prevent the spread of the disease are very real and something any new vaccine needs to be monitored for
13274,I'm twice the man I used to be!
13275,Ok.
13276,"Thought I saw an 80%ish number posted here a couple, must not have been."
13277,"Honestly, slim."
13278,We have a lot of pharmacy regulars in the older age range unable to set up appointments online themselves.
13279,"So right now spares/cancellations are for our store employees, and our regular elderly/immunocompromised patients unable to find a vaccine elsewhere."
13280,Maybe in a week or two we’d be more lenient.
13281,But it also creates an “expectant” mentality with people and they also don’t even attempt to make an appointment
13282,Fucking clownworld
13283,"I love the ambiguous terms “may” and “almost”
can i try?"
13284,Reddit users may believe “ almost anything”.
13285,Every US adult should have access by the end of summer.
13286,We shouldn’t create a digital passport for a 3 month gap in vaccines.
13287,Once the government has that power they will not just give it up once everyone is vaccinated.
13288,If someone is worried about getting the virus even after everyone is vaccinated  they should be take personal responsibility and isolate but don’t make the rest of us give up privacy
13289,That's great to hear.
13290,Maybe Newsom can take some notes.
13291,Although at this point I think he gets off on having the most draconian/restrictive covid response.
13292,"This website https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/

Surely Israel is improving."
13293,Just not as much as I would have thought they should be with their world leading vaccine rollout.

13297,"And you are the biggest cry baby who started name calling me and accused me of being part of some other subs when I'm not, just because I criticized your beloved echo chamber."
13298,And you talk about 'questioning' and 'dissent'.
13299,Irony.
13300,Your behavior clearly reflects of the mentality of the echo chamber you are from.
13301,Every thing you say is correct.
13302,Everyone else is just an Andh Bhakt or a chodi member.
13303,Typical randian.
13304,"No, not even remotely close to 80% of the populace in Israel has been vaccinated."
13305,"They're at around 50% I think, but many of those were only recently vaccinated and have not yet built up immunity."
13306,[removed]
13307,California has been one of the most strict restriction states in the country.
13308,That was the point.
13309,"If you couldn't tell that ""locking them in their houses"" was a hyperbole, you might want to work on your critical thinking."
13310,"No shit, they weren't actually locking people in their houses."
13311,But anyone who has paid attention knows what I meant.
13312,I miss the days when you could actually have a discussion without someone nitpicking every little detail.
13313,Yes you did.
13314,Thanks.
13315,Thank you for the detailed answer!
13316,Man i almost forgot about the beach closures last summer.
13317,"For some reason beaches in particular were vilified (even on reddit), but looking back, it's literally one of the safest activities people could've been doing."
13318,Probably a lot better for you than staying at home and watch tv like people were told to do.
13319,"Oh yeah, and i remember every playground was blocked off with caution tape for most of the year until a couple months ago."
13320,"Great work, Newsom, really keeping people safe..."
13321,Based on the way my city is vaccinating people if they switched to an 8 week wait now every single adult that wanted one could be vaccinated before the second doses even started
13322,Annual pass.
13323,"Define meaningful percentage, more than a few people died in the 1957/1968 pandemics and Tuberculosis  killed 1.4 million people in 2019."
13324,TB and COVID spread in a very similar fashion; it makes no sense to compare COVID to the flu when TB kills so many people and spreads the same way.
13325,This has been my strategy the whole past year.
13326,Internet warriors shouldn’t dictate anyone’s decisions.
13327,"You only get to do this once, do it the way you want."
13328,I mean I would feel much more confident in the effectiveness of my vaccination if 80% of the population was vaccinated instead of the 10% we are currently at.
13329,Twitter should both be able to remove harmful health misinformation and be protected from lawsuits based on content that users upload.
13330,Don’t be COVID Aladeen!

13333,Is it Peaks?
13334,Cause I’m on Peaks.
13335,"Yeah for me it's not so much the masks, it's the ""you might die getting the groceries"" part I'm tired of."

13344,You can't get anything from that given the y-axis.
13345,Unlike during the pandemic
13346,There are a projected 74 million children (17 and under) in the United States.
13347,Multiple Google sources.
13348,No idea where you pulled that number.

13355,You lose your point when you lie about other states locking residents in houses.
13356,Can't you make your point honestly from the beginning instead of only when challenged?
13357,That's why I booked a trip this week for November.
13358,"Not confident to go international yet, but I'll be enjoying a couple weeks in Hawaii."
13359,"So frustrating that so many other countries could use these spare doses in a day, yet France moaned about not receiving enough, then do nothing when they get them."
13360,The US is practically in second place among large nations.
13361,"I was surprised to see at least in IL how few people are older than 16 younger than 64, not essential workers nor have comorbidities."
13362,It was less than a million.
13363,"Well, at least they've finally given up spouting the ""two week"" BS."
13364,"So, now they're talking in months instead."
13365,"At the end of this ""2-3 months"" it will be another 2-3 months."
13366,We have real-world data from places like the UK and Quebec showing that this is effective.
13367,Why everyone seems to send their applications late to EMA?
13368,This is a dialectical pricess.
13369,Companies won't as well waste their time sending applications before it is useful.
13370,"They are or should be in constant and close contact, rather than the EMA just passively waiting for labs to fill a form online."
13371,Actually it's people  mixing that causes mutations to spread rapidly.
13372,"But when you reduce infections to a low level with vaccination you can spot new clusters taking off, when infections are already high it takes longer to realise you have a problematic variant."
13373,"Spot a cluster quickly and you can local lockdown, ring vaccinate with a modified vaccine or just start issuing the nitric oxide sprays that are looking promising."
13374,Almost everyone seems to forget that improved therapeutics or other interventions are ways out of this.
13375,I mentioned the sprays - adding uvc lights to ventilations systems would also help.
13376,"Work on such things hasnt stopped, they are just getting less public attention."
13377,But did they send their approval request later as they knew the liability position of the EC on vaccines
13378,What's the ap program?
13379,[deleted]
13380,"Here is some decent guidance for the time being:

With how wide spread Covid still is you need to keep in mind that the vaccine is not 100% effective."
13381,About 1 in 20 people are still vulnerable after two doses.
13382,"This fact is significantly mitigated when most of the population is vaccinated, but until that time, it is worthwhile act under the assumption that you personally may still be vulnerable to Covid even after the vaccine."
13383,"Yeah, I'm just glad we have an actual goal."
13384,Hopefully we can reassess that goal if vaccinations level off too early.
13385,The vaccine was actually developed by Janssen (subsidiary of J&amp;J) in The Netherlands.
13386,"And by ""doesn't seem to be any room for a nuanced approach"" a great example is the person replying to me going off about ""controlling others"" because I said I don't know how people can justify packing into literally full bars and restaurants."
13387,"Just go to cia.gov, then click on ""About Us"", then ""How we meddle in other countries"", and then select a country on the map."
13388,"Duh, it's the CIA."
13389,"Of course they make an effort to keep this shit under the rugs, but enough has leaked to seriously stain the facade."
13390,In most cases yes it does improve mental health.
13391,But there have been cases where people over exercise and become hyper aware of their appearance and develop eating disorders.
13392,We need to stop encouraging exercise to get abs and butt.
13393,Lets encourage exercise for the better health outcomes.
13394,You are being ridiculous.
13395,"So just because the IFR is a ""generalised statistic"" we should all act like it's 50%?"
13396,What kind of argument is that?
13397,The 0.003% chance I could die is not playing Russian roulette with my life.
13398,I mean I've seen some weird arguments but an argument that says ignore statistics because we can't predict exactly what'll happen for every person is pretty high up there.
13399,And what about people who haven't been able to see their parents in a year?
13400,"These restrictions are very real and many people have been taking them seriously (despite how badly people want to piss all over the USA and claim that ""NO ONE DID ANYTHING TO MITIGATE THE SPREAD"")"

13402,"As a current resident of Midtown, exactly this."
13403,"I live across the street from a Publix and down the street from a Whole Foods, but guess what?"
13404,"My apartment's total rent is just under $4,800/mo, split between *four people* (smaller student housing at that)."
13405,That's an absurdly high barrier considering that all I see when I look out my window are other overpriced high-rises.
13406,And what else?
13407,Rent goes up every year.
13408,"This city is a living hell if you don't have a car, especially if you also have a family to take care of with a low income."
13409,Yes.
13410,I just miss being able to breathe the same air as my fellow humans.
13411,It's such a natural thing I've always taken for granted.
13412,"&gt;	Saying children under 20, or even 16 aren’t dying from covid is false, because children have died."
13413,This is just dumb and an absurd attempt to dismiss verified patterns of infection rates by pointing out outlier anomalies.
13414,You’re ignoring the science.
13415,"Ppl under 20 aren’t susceptible to the virus anything close to the rest of the population 

&gt;	Saying children are unaffected is also false."
13416,Use your head and try interpreting the actual data that is known regarding infection rates by age.
13417,"&gt;	Children have been getting MIS-C, which the CDC states they are still learning about and have no idea why some kids get it and don’t."
13418,What is the per capita rate children are getting this?
13419,"&gt;While most children will hopefully recover, some will die (even without the MIS-C), and we don’t even know full long-term effects for children except some may need long term coronary care."
13420,"Again, at what rate are children getting this?"
13421,"Is it 1 in 10,000 or 1 in 1,000?"
13422,Please provide the data as to the frequency children are being affected.
13423,&gt;	Blanket statements that children are unaffected and won’t die is like some people just outright ignore data and science to sound informed but really just ignore data points that don’t fit their  beliefs.
13424,What science and a data are you suggesting is being ignored?
13425,I’ve offered actual data that shows just how minimal the impact on children are.
13426,If you’re claiming that data was wrong please provide something to support that claim.
13427,Till you do that you’re doing nothing but trying to create disinformation in an attempt to sensationalize this topic.
13428,"&gt;	My example of lung damage was just that, an example."
13429,"Again, Could you please provide data that shows how frequent children are developing such health issues due to covid?"
13430,&gt;Much like covid in adults we don’t know true long-term effects as we’re not exactly long term in the timeline.
13431,Why does this even mean?
13432,Are you suggesting policy based on “we just don’t know” and ignoring the science that is known?
13433,"Why, what is your end goal here suggesting to suggest we ignore the science/data that is now available when formulating how we move forward with this virus?"
13434,&gt;	So if i understand what your asking is about right now?
13435,We do know there can be long term issues for children.
13436,"We know exactly infection rates, deaths and the effects covid has on the population by age grout."
13437,What data are you utilizing here to push this fear over covid and what is it you’re advocating for?
13438,Please explain yourself!
13439,&gt;Are they all lung related?
13440,"Probably not, are they potentially serious resulting in long term issues and death?"
13441,Yes.
13442,"Again, what data are you using?"
13443,Is there any or are you simply looking to stoke fear?
13444,Please explain yourself and your lack of verifiable evidence to support whatever it is you’re advocating for..
13445,Wut
13446,&gt; and the amount of disposable income available increase since the 80s.
13447,Did you mean to say disposable income?
13448,Because that doesn't mean much.
13449,Discretionary income is the number we should be using here.
13450,"As a Canadian in my 20s, I expect to get my first dose in June."
13451,I've been feeling the same way.
13452,"I know Newsom is in a weird spot where he gets criticized on both ends, from the people who think he should open up ASAP, and the other end that freaks out anytime he does lift any restrictions, and feels like he should enforce MORE restrictions."
13453,"Personally, at the start of the pandemic we were told this was all about preventing hospitals from being overwhelmed."
13454,"To my knowledge, no hospitals were actually overwhelmed (though it did get a little dicey in some places in Dec.) If they weren't overwhelmed then, and cases and hospitals are plummetting, why do we still need these restrictions?"
13455,"Combine that with the fact that he has no plans for a full reopening ever (literally the lowest tier is yellow, there is no green tier), living in California just feels hopeless like your said."
13456,Especially with seeing other states gradually lift restrictions.
13457,[removed]
13458,The problem is the reduced effectiveness means there will be people who get the vaccine AND still get the virus.
13459,This happening at a higher frequency increases the likelihood that the virus develops an immunity to the vaccine.
13460,"We have antibiotic resistant strains of bugs today because most people stop taking antibiotics when they feel better, rather than taking them for the duration prescribed."
13461,The bugs develop a resistance over time.
13462,That's currently a huge problem.
13463,We have many more antibiotics than we do covid vaccines and most covid vaccines are so similar that if a stain developed resistance to the vaccine we likely wouldn't have an effective vaccine once again for many many months.
13464,Covid is a long term problem.
13465,We need a long term solution.
13466,We can't weaken the long term solution for short term results that won't last.
13467,The risk is too high.
13468,Risking the vaccines effectiveness could be more disastrous than the pointless non-lockdown lockdown we did for months.
13469,I’m 18 and am already on a waiting list to sign up in my area.
13470,"As soon as it opens to 1B here, I can sign up for a vaccine."
13471,"We don't talk about COVID-01 through COVID-18 anymore, do we, smart guy?"
13472,I know this might seem like a dumb question at this point and I think I know the answer but I just want reassurance.
13473,"If i'm vaccinated, and my friend had covid 2 months ago, there's no risk to us hanging out without any precautions right?"
13474,"We are averaging about 70k new cases per day, and 1.2 million doses of vaccine per day."
13475,That's a 17:1 ratio.
13476,There is no way the virus will spread enough to cause another surge.
13477,Numbers will only continue to go down in all the important areas like hospitalizations and deaths.
13478,"We -may- see higher ""case numbers"" but percent positivity will likely decrease continuously as well."
13479,"Obviously the virus is still present and people will still have terrible outcomes, but to suggest that another ""surge"" is coming is just.. well.. wrong."
13480,"Even if cases go up, more and more old and high-risk people are getting vaccinated, and they are *by far* the most likely to end up in the hospital capacity or to die."
13481,"With these vaccinations, we’d still be far better off than we were in the fall."
13482,[removed]
13483,I got my first dose on New Year's Eve.
13484,"Not a frontline healthcare worker, been WFH since last April, but I work for a hospital... at the time, NY was only allowing hospitals to vaccinate healthcare workers but they were going to start fining them for letting vaccines sit in the fridge, so my hospital went nuts vaccinating every employee."
13485,92% of us in the IT division got vaccinated according to the one chart that I saw.
13486,Canada needs to step it up
13487,Most means majority.
13488,Unless you're trying to claim it doesn't count because most Americans don't vote.
13489,I know more about dust than you think I do.
13490,And I believe you know less about the reasons for covid prevention than you think you know.
13491,"I never claimed anything about 15 minutes, so direct that criticism to someone else."
13492,"As for the 6 ft rule, that recommendation was intended for avoiding the larger droplets, which dont stay aloft for more than 30 seconds."
13493,"Additionally, they recommended that people not stay in shared public spaces for more than a half hour to avoid breathing in enough suspended aerosols to exceed what scientists believed to be the threshold of viral load to cause infection."
13494,"So, you do not hold some secret to viral spread that they overlooked."
13495,I really dont have to go up into the attic with a flashlight because I already knew what you did about the continual lofting of dust due to thermal circulation.
13496,There is more than one way to keep dust aloft and kicking it up from your floor is only one way.
13497,My mention of that one way does not imply that there are no other ways.
13498,But it seems I must repeat myself.
13499,"Virus particles are sticky and unlike a dust particle, once they land, they do not become airborne again by a mere thermal circulation of air."
13500,"AC helps a virus particle stay aloft for much longer than undisturbed air but not for more than 3 hours before the virus sticks to a surface, where it eventually become inert."

13535,Sometimes life hits you and you need to bounce back.
13536,If someone has allowed themselves to care so little about their health to become 300lbs+ then I think COVID will have little if any impact on changing their minds.

13550,The issue is not just simple exposure to the virus - what we seem to be dealing with is that the virus is simply more potent when inhaled vs ingested.
13551,Not really sure how you would directly test that without actually exposing people in a controlled experiment.
13552,Just seeing that there is viable virus on surfaces doesn't really tell your anything if the virus needs to be properly inhaled.
13553,The contact tracing and epidemiology should really be able to answer this question though.
13554,"Which is why we say it seems like fomite transmission is rare - not just because we don't see people getting sick from having food delivered, but also if fomites were a serious risk, then bad mask hygiene and improper mask re-use would be making people sick."
13555,"But it's the opposite - even thee laziest, most marginal mask behavior seems to have a huge protective effect."

13642,It would also be pretty expensive if the virus was allowed to replicate all over the developing world and spit out some unforeseen variant that fucks everything right back up.
13643,"Not sure what the odds of that even would be, but it's in everyone's interest to tamp it down ASAP."
13644,"I think it's still largely symbolic, I doubt we'll see stores taking down signs yet, and outside large cities you never see people wearing a mask anyway."
13645,"It's still gonna come down to, those who want to be responsible will wear a mask, and everyone else will continue to not wear a mask."

13681,Your argument was that comparing heroin addicts to sugar addicts is “insanely disingenuous.” I was only trying to point out that studies have strongly suggested otherwise.
13682,Did you not see what happened in April or May when places didn’t take COVID seriously and tried to rush reopening and then caused cases to spike?
13683,The United States as a whole is the epitome of rushing into things prolonging it.
13684,"New Zealand , and East Asian countries are basically done with COVID for months now because they took it seriously in the beginning."
13685,Are you only talking about New Zealand and Australia?
13686,I was under the impression that several states within the US and a lot of Europe listened to scientists.
13687,How is it going for them?
13688,Just reported this comment for spreading misinformation about COVID19
13689,This subreddit will certainly have a meltdown over it
13690,Massachusetts has a Republican governor and they still have a ton of restrictions.
13691,"Still mask mandates, still 50%  capacity outside restaurants, where it is still only 6 people per table."
13692,"Still no amusement parks, bars, festivals, outdoor events, etc."
13693,It is not literally opening everything up.
13694,"They are opening some things up, and again that is a Republican governor as well."
13695,very accurate comparison to a fly over state with 3.2 million people throughout 56k square miles!
13696,The troubling thing is that none of the health messaging from governments ever says to lose weight.
13697,&gt;This is just dumb and an absurd attempt to dismiss verified patterns of infection rates by pointing out outlier anomalies.
13698,You’re ignoring the science.
13699,I'm not ignoring the science.
13700,"Science says children can die from Covid, and MIS-C can have long term effects that we don't yet fully know because it hasn't actually been all that long."
13701,"&gt;Ppl under 20 aren’t susceptible to the virus anything close to the rest of the population

I didn't say they were, so I am glad we can agree?"
13702,&gt;What is the per capita rate children are getting this?
13703,"I'm on mobile and formatting is already annoying, so I'm not going to sort through statistics for you."
13704,I welcome you to do some fairly easy google searches to find the CDC information on this (or plenty of other health publications) if your legitimately interested.
13705,&gt;What science and a data are you suggesting is being ignored?
13706,I’ve offered actual data that shows just how minimal the impact on children are.
13707,If you’re claiming that data was wrong please provide something to support that claim.
13708,"You actually haven't provided data in this comment chain other then you said ""Nonetheless, children under the age of 20 aren’t dying from covid.""."
13709,"Regardless, I'm not claiming any data is wrong, I am claiming that you, as the person in this chain that has said nothing other then children don't die is wrong."
13710,"Because factually whether an ""anomaly"" or not they can and have."
13711,Whether that data point is small or not is still data.
13712,&gt;Till you do that you’re doing nothing but trying to create disinformation in an attempt to sensationalize this topic.
13713,Uhhh what?
13714,When did I even attempt to create disinformation?
13715,Nothing I said was factually incorrect.
13716,"And as for ""an attempt to sensationalize this topic"", you started this entire conversation."
13717,"I made a general comment (to a different user) that long term issues are possible, because they are, and that as such like said user despite being likely to survive still didn't want to contract it."
13718,&gt;Why does this even mean?
13719,Are you suggesting policy based on “we just don’t know” and ignoring the science that is known?
13720,"&gt;  
&gt;Why, what is your end goal here suggesting to suggest we ignore the science/data that is now available when formulating how we move forward with this virus?"
13721,My end goal here was to agree with a general comment by another user that you tried to turn into some kind of weird pissing match with me.
13722,Literally nothing about policy or moving forward was discussed between me and that user or even you and me prior to our interaction.
13723,"&gt;We know exactly infection rates, deaths and the effects covid has on the population by age grout."
13724,What data are you utilizing here to push this fear over covid and what is it you’re advocating for?
13725,I'm not pushing fear of any kind.
13726,"I'm not pushing anything, actually I didn't even reply to you in this chain to begin with I replied to someone else and you took it upon yourself to tell me  ""It’s like ppl are outright ignore data and science to push unsubstantiated fear mongering""."
13727,"Perhaps you should look back up through this chain and you will see I was advocating for the same thing the person above me was, not catching covid because despite being in an age group likely to survive I still don't want it in my system as it can cause long-term issues."
13728,Literally had nothing to do with anything else and wasn't even directed at you.
13729,"&gt;Again, what data are you using?"
13730,Is there any or are you simply looking to stoke fear?
13731,"&gt;  
&gt;Please explain yourself and your lack of verifiable evidence to support whatever it is you’re advocating for..

Again, not looking to ""stoke"" fear."
13732,I haven't said anything that isn't searchable and relatively easy to find.
13733,You can verify in a quick search that MIS-C can have long-term effects and that people under 20 die from covid.
13734,"Everything I have said came from CDC, Yale Medicine, WHO, the Mayo clinic and probably a couple others I have forgotten."
13735,"You're the one here who is trying to say people under 20 don't die (false) and have no lasting effects (also false in the current ""long term"" that we are)."
13736,"I don't disagree that the number of dead or long term illness is smaller in the younger age group, I also literally never said this, but you seem to be trying to use it as a gotcha moment, but to say it doesn't happen is false."
13737,I honestly don't understand how we got to this point with you bringing up stuff that was never mentioned from a general comment I made to someone else.
13738,If you're looking for a debate with someone I don't have the time or energy for it so you might want to try and find it somewhere else.
13739,Hope you have a wonderful day.
13740,"I'd be really surprised if places like HEB, Costco etc suddenly give up on requiring masks."
13741,I think this will just change the usually skeevy superspreader places like Twin Peaks and clubs.
13742,I think maybe slowly open everything back up; rather than just reopen everything at once instantly.
13743,That seems like a very bad idea.
13744,"But with the decline in hospitalizations and increase in vaccination, I guess Texans are gonna be the Nation's guinea pig to see what happens if go this drastic measure in regards to reopening."
13745,I appreciate the link.
13746,"So far, everything is out of stock/fully booked still."
13747,That’s already how it’s been...how do people think this is a political battle??

I'm not sure how much good they did in the first place, when many people didn't wear masks in private gatherings; which were behind the bulk of cases this Winter."
13758,"People who believe in masks are doing to continue to wear them anyways, and same goes for the people who don't"
13759,I really don't understand the down votes on this.
13760,I'll be wearing a mask on public transportation the rest of my life.
13761,You guys have fun getting unnecessarily ill.
13762,Most people don't care about the flu enough to wear masks.
13763,"Even in East Asian countries that are stereotypically described as mask cultures, only a minority do, at least for healthy people not displaying any symptoms."
13764,"Or our deaths, that were averaging 34 at the mask mandate and are averaging 228 now?"
13765,Is that what mission accomplished looks like?
13766,Depression is not what we are talking about here.
13767,Stick to the topic at hand or stay out.
13768,"&gt;casual shopping or out for a beer with friends, or have in person game nights

Where can't you do this right now?"
13769,I'm on the super restrictive west coast and all of this is officially kosher under our state guidelines.
13770,"I can go indoors into a bar at 25% capacity with a friend and get a beer or have it outside, retail is open, and the guideline is 5 people for private indoor gatherings (but really who's going to enforce that?)."
13771,Just because people on reddit make absolutist statements about how wrong any of that is doesn't mean you have to listen to them.
13772,"There will be plenty of redditors, and even some health officials, who will *always* say these are bad ideas."
13773,You've gotta decide for yourself.
13774,Realistically a few young healthy people seeing each other is not a big deal right now.
13775,Probably.
13776,Symptoms often aid in the spread of a disease.
13777,I still stay they should have stopped after season 9!!
13778,It went all to shit after that
13779,I bought tickets to Florida (already had second vaccine) and I have had non-stop issues with my flights being canceled or changed.
13780,I hope you have better luck.
13781,"The UK isn't a ""euro country"" and the EU is exporting more vaccines than it's importing."

13786,Very true.
13787,I’m curious to see how their numbers look in the coming weeks...
13788,The Dakotas have the highest cases per capita in the country
13789,"If they don't, they'll have some other bs excuse"
13790,"I agree with the majority of what you said, but in fairness there was a shitload of mixed signals coming out of various offices that led to a lot of confusing messaging."
13791,"In my state it went from ""2 weeks to flatten the curve"" to ""Ok by summer things should be back to normal"" to ""no normal until a vaccine."""
13792,Even me a fairly well educated college graduate at times got confused with the different messaging.
13793,I can't blame anyone who was also confused and thought we would be back to some degree of normalcy sooner then summer of 2021.
13794,Oh no!
13795,They're not afraid enough.
13796,RELEASE VARIANT X
13797,"This motto does seem shortsighted now, but it doesn’t change the reality of our current situation which has evolved with time and additional research."
13798,We shouldn’t use frustration with the accuracy of old advice to guide our current approach.
13799,Also that people will just lie and say they were vaccinated so they don’t have to wear a mask.
13800,again.
13801,we need to do both.
13802,"and as long as stores to the right thing, doesn't matter what the selfish people think."

13804,I have no regrets about it.
13805,Done.
13806,"You say that, and while that's theoretically true I've seen first hand that someone in ""power"" not explicitly saying ""wear a mask"" will lead to people choosing to not wear one."
13807,"How, you may ask?"
13808,My workplace.
13809,I was the ONLY one to wear a mask.
13810,"My bosses never explicitly said no masks, but then also never explicitly said to wear them."
13811,20 other people in that office saw me every day for months and even saw me start to double mask and not a single one decided they were going to mask as well.
13812,"You absolutely cannot trust that people wi do the ""right"" thing if it's not explicitly told for them to do it."

13814,"The thing is, all of these other states that have been quite open have still followed the same curves as all of the others."
13815,"It’s not like we haven’t seen states open things up ‘prematurely’, just look at Florida or Georgia or iowa."
13816,"Another thing is that we aren’t going to ‘stop’ Covid, we’re going to make it an issue that’s not worth all of The fuss."
13817,"I’d say a good portion of the restrictions were never worth it, but Covid is on track to become a very minor issue."
13818,"Also, 90%+ capacity in hospitals isn’t the kind of thing that’ll break them, it’s commonplace for hospitals to be at 90% during a slightly more busy time."
13819,"It’s not like we don’t have the resources to get more healthcare capacity, we have had so much time, we just haven’t really needed it."
13820,I think he sees the attention that Noem and DeSantis were getting at CPAC and wants some of that action.
13821,"The more of your constituents die, the higher you go in 2024 GOP primary polls."
13822,2 more weeks right?
13823,"I was doing my yearly covid rewatch and have a new theory: the smoke monster is the source of covid, it all began when Locke opened the hatch"
13824,"old normal has ~30,000 flu deaths a year."
13825,"Even if we can only cut that number in a third, most people would see ""If we do this we can save 10,000 lives"" and say ""sign me up""."
13826,"I mean, we did after all invade a whole country over the death of a third of that number."
13827,The finish line is right fucking there you fuck
13828,Florida has a higher deaths per capita rate than Mexico.
13829,If they were their own country they'd be about 15th in the world.
13830,"""Better"" is relative, overall the US is doing piss poor."
13831,That's what the scientist said when the media asked the question.
13832,"Media then reported ""vaccine may not prevent transmission"", because they're idiots."
13833,My point is that using that point to invalidate masks is inept
13834,Exactly.
13835,"Redditors put a lot of faith in statistics 

Like I doubt someone from the census is going door to door in Syria during  shelling or skirmishes or Caracas while the entire country is disintegrating and gathering population data."
13836,If they are then god speed
13837,Why is vaccinating teachers bad?

13839,Where are you that you can't do these things?
13840,"The second ""lockdown"" where I am didn't even close shopping at all, and bars/restaurants were only closed around the holidays and while I think they are supposed to have some restrictions still, many aren't following."
13841,And my state seemed to be one of the more cautious ones.
13842,Other countries also have lifted a lot of restrictions.
13843,"""AZ's reputation already suffered back in November when the efficacy results from the trials were reported."
13844,"Of course people thought bad of it when they read 50%-70% with botched trials vs 95% mRNA in every newspaper."""
13845,Interim results were published in December and showed 62-90% efficacy.
13846,"I’ve worn one at least 45 hours a week since this all started(~11 months), and by this point if I found out the world was going to be like this forever I wouldn’t really mind."
13847,"Wearing a mask is hard, huh."
13848,Either people will be immune from vaccination or they'll be immune from infection.
13849,Doesn't matter.
13850,"I know I'm totally getting banned for this, but the performance of mask wearing areas and non-mask wearing areas are identical."
13851,"Masks clearly work for flu, for covid, a year in, it's obvious they are ineffective."
13852,We need to cancel all busybody interventions and keep what's actually working: vaccinations.
13853,I wear a mask to protect you.
13854,You wear a mask to protect me.
13855,Neither is very effective without the other.
13856,It's about what we owe each other.
13857,"I agree that it's sad that we *need* to mandate mask wearing, but here we are."
13858,AZ sent the request for approval later so as to hide its production shortfalls.

13936,I'm going to take a guess that when nothing really happens in Texas over the course of the next month we will just move onto the next thing.
13937,It's like the Florida beaches last spring all over again.

13944,"It makes sense to think of public health in adversarial terms, similarly to a court of law."
13945,"Public health experts will *always* encourage greater precautions, because that's their job, not to decide on what falls under some neutral notion of right or wrong."
13946,"The non-tech business community representing the traditional in-person economy will likewise, *as a rule*, advocate for its side of the debate."
13947,"And it is up to decision makers to play the role of the judge, reconciling these competing adversarial interests."
13948,"""Allowing public health experts to lead"" is conflating the roles of the judiciary and the prosecution; public health experts are litigators for a particular side of the debate, which is fine, because again, that's their job, but they ought to be treated as such."
13949,Went to Florida in early January.
13950,Changed my perspective for sure.
13951,"Australia and New Zealand have been remarkably successful in containing new sources of spread through mandatory quarantines for international arrivals and aggressive contact tracing, combined with short circuit breaker style lockdowns when outbreaks occur."
13952,"They have far exceeded my expectations, and as a result of their aggressive measures they are currently enjoying public gatherings and an ordinary quality of life."
13953,You didn't cite any actual data.
13954,The data mostly disagrees with your point.
13955,Texas voters are concerned about the Coronavirus.

14518,At all.

14531,"Again California with its low obesity rates, warm weather, young population, insanely high mask usage, and extremely high restrictions has the same deaths per million as FL, TX, GA, etc


It failed."
14532,This is what that Atlantic article published a few weeks ago stated.
14533,"One about how we're entering the ""in between"" time from ""Pandemic"" to ""post Pandemic""."
14534,"Something about how it takes time for variants to cause the virus to make a significant ""comeback"", and in light of vaccines the virus doesn't have time on its side."

14542,It's not that lockdowns don't work.
14543,Crap lockdowns don't work.
14544,Crap anything doesn't work.
14545,"Crap knives don't cut, crap cars don't handle well, crap stereos sound bad."
14546,The uk has had lockdowns that were bought off a bloke in the pub who swore they weren't nicked and they would work perfectly.
14547,"The restrictions imposed on the uk have been half measures, imposed too late, lifted to early, and badly observed and enforced when they were there."
14548,As a result the economy has been operating in a whole year if twilight and uncertainty with little prospect of an end.
14549,The vaccines are a hail mary which I hope will work.
14550,Texas lifted it today.
14551,"The followed similar waves that all other areas with similar demographics, culture, and geography did."
14552,"They had a small summer wave, like CA, NV, AZ,TX, and other southern states and a winter wave like the entire US did."
14553,Plus FL has a much higher average age than other US states.
14554, \&gt;We have to learn to live with it.
14555,That's why we made vaccines.
14556,Can everyone who wants a vaccine get a vaccine in Texas right now?
14557,NO.
14558,"It's not about flattening the curve anymore, it's about making sure enough people are vaccinated."
14559,States should not even consider opening up until every adult is able to get a vaccine.
14560,Correct.
14561,And then we learned more and now we understand that is no longer true.
14562,"We also used to think the Earth was the center of the universe, solar system, and flat."
14563,"We used to not know there were multiple blood types, we used to not be aware of bacteria or viruses."

14565,This is not a difficult concept to understand.
14566,huh?
14567,most people are still wearing masks in the majority of places which helps keep cases down.
14568,[removed]
14569,Of course there isn't a study on long-term effects.
14570,"But by ""cutting corners"" I assumed you meant that the process has more holes in it than the normal non-Pandemic approval process."
14571,"And your example only shows that the normal non-Pandemic approval process already isn't perfect and in my opinion that even makes it harder to argue, should side effects occur, that these have been caused by cutting corners and not by the already flawed standard process."
14572,"&gt; On this sub, there are a lot of people like that."
14573,Can confirm.

14583,Wearing masks has resulted in virtually no flu deaths this year.
14584,"That could save approximately 50,000 lives each year"
14585,"Do 500,000 people need to die in order for you to care?"
14586,In my lifetime more people have died from the flu than from COVID.
14587,Is that not worrisome to you?
14588,23.2 doses per American is the average and were at 22.76 and we have been gaining on the National average every day.
14589,Pretty good.
14590,Countries that were universally listening to the recommendations of scientists have been doing things like in-person sporting events and all sorts of nice things that we can't do in the United States because a huge chunk of our population doesn't want to listen to people whose entire lives have been dedicated to handling situations like this.
14591,"when you adjust the outcomes for population, a country like Canada did significantly better than the United States."
14592,"New Zealand, South Korea, etc had much better outcomes and leaned more heavily into following the recommendations of the medical community."
14593,US adult obesity rate is 42.4 percent.
14594,Have at it hoss.
14595,I don’t mind seeing the world burn.
14596,I suppose you believe in the science of chiropractors as well because they’re established everywhere too right?

14598,All the experts you go to have no idea what they’re talking about.
14599,You’re being lied to and scammed of your money.
14600,This is 100% getting locked lol what a stupid decision Texas.
14601,"Ah yes, spring and winter 2020 would’ve been just fine if we didn’t wear masks!, no deaths, hospitalizations or new cases would’ve happened."
14602,Thanks for solving the problem!
14603,"Other counties such as Napa, Santa Clara, and San Luis Obispo moved to the red tier as well."
14604,"From the article, the red tier includes:

-Expanding outdoor dining to allow three households of up to six people

-Allowing personal services that require the removal of masks outdoors and indoors, with specific health and safety measures in place

-Opening indoor dining (including bars with full meal service, food courts, hotel restaurants) at 25% capacity, but limited to four people from one household, requiring that indoor dinner service end by 10 p.m., and other safety requirements

-Opening indoor gyms and fitness centers at 10% capacity

-Opening indoor museums, zoos and aquariums at 25% capacity

-Opening indoor movie theaters at 25% capacity without concessions

-Opening outdoor stand-alone amusement park rides such as Ferris wheels, carousels and train rides

-Lifting nighttime restrictions on gatherings and non-essential business activities between the hours of 10 p.m. and 5 a.m.

-Allowing limited use of indoor pools

While the state allows indoor retail to expand to 50% capacity in the red tier, S.F."
14605,will keep it capped at 25%.
14606,Small indoor gatherings will also remain restricted.
14607,[deleted]
14608,Neither.
14609,It simply makes sense for a limited amount of time.
14610,"&gt;If someone wants to lie about their status and risk their life

They are risking the lives of anyone not yet vaccinated."
14611,Yep or they’ll start using it as evidence that “vaccines don’t work” because they didn’t wait for it to work.
14612,"It’s the right time to relax restrictions a good bit given cases have gone down and despite the media hype over the variants, the variants haven’t caused cases to go up."
14613,Moving to a more relaxed reopening tier is not a bad idea even if this sub won’t agree in all likelihood.
14614,However what Texas is doing here is pretty irresponsible and far too soon.

14625,Here is where you say that the UK is extra special and we are not like other countries.
14626,And it's bollocks.
14627,Nothing.
14628,"Cases, hospitalizations, and deaths will keep falling in Texas."

14662,How is it going for the states and countries that listened to scientists?
14663,Governor of Texas.
14664,Those vaccines prevent illness and transmission for the said cold and flu virus they are built against.
14665,Flu vaccine is only designed to target the 3-4 flu strains that are predicted to be the most dominant that year.
14666,Because the cold and flu mutate so rapidly (also why they typically aren't as deadly) there's a high chance you can still catch/transmit a strain of cold/flu your vaccine offered zero protection for.
14667,Predictions for which strains will be dominant in a given year can also easily be incorrect.
14668,"So yes they offer immunity and protection from transmission, but there's much higher odds it's protecting you from the wrong virus as well."
14669,[removed]
14670,Exactly.
14671,The fear-mongering and obsession with continuing the Hell we’ve been in is fucking strange.

14700,Your comment is far too much hyperbole to be taken seriously.
14701,We need to foster a work culture where it is encouraged and acceptable to stay home when you are sick.

14703,"If you think the majority of people will succumb to wearing a mask in the future when Covid has gone, you are kidding yourself."
14704,I think we'll be just fine in Texas.
14705,Deaths/Hospitalizations will continue to decline and more and more of us will get the vaccine.
14706,Were there multiple vaccines a year ago?
14707,More spread = more opportunities for a variant with sufficient immune escape characteristics to the current vaccines to develop.
14708,From a risk/benefit perspective you gain essentially nothing while risking a 6+ month reset in the vaccine rollout.
14709,This is political posturing and nothing more.
14710,Back in 1918 mask mandates were enforced at gunpoint.
14711,"I understand that the restrictions seem orwellian, but they are really mild compared to past viral outbreaks."

14725,He is literally destroying businesses at the last minute.
14726,I didn’t minimize trips and wear a mask and do my part for a fucking year just to catch this because a store lifted a mask mandate a few months before I’m eligible for a vaccine.
14727,I won’t be at any business that lifts their mandate until vaccines are available and I’m not alone.

14763,"In moving to First Doses First, the UK government considered this argument and [concluded](https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/954990/s1015-sars-cov-2-immunity-escape-variants.pdf):

&gt;For both vaccines approved for use in the UK,the virus neutralization titres and efficacy are higher after two doses than one."
14764,"There is therefore a higher risk of virus replication under  partial  immunity after  one  dose  than  after  two  doses,  so  in  the  short-term, delaying the second dose would be expected to somewhat increase the probability of emergence of vaccine resistance -but probably from a low base."
14765,"&gt;Whilst  the neutralization titres seen  after  one  dose  of  vaccine  are  lower  than  the median titre of convalescent plasma, they are within the lower range of responses seen following natural infection."
14766,"However,

&gt;It is a realistic possibility that over time immune escape variants will emerge, most likely driven by increasing population immunity following natural infection."
14767,"Unlike with antibiotic resistance, there are many ways we might end up with antibody (vaccine) resistance."
14768,"Yes, it might come from people getting infected between their first and second doses of Pfizer/Moderna."
14769,Or from people given one dose of J&amp;J or any of the other weaker vaccines.
14770,Or following a natural infection--this may be how the UK and SA variants arose.
14771,"From a variant evolution standpoint, is it more important to have fewer people with imperfect immunity or to suppress the spread rapidly so that people with imperfect immunity come into contact with the virus less often?"
14772,"It doesn't seem obvious, and if it's the latter then First Doses First is the way to go."
14773,"It’s funny that aircrew with exemptions to most quarantines, (Hawaii, Canada, US international testing requirement to return) isn’t on the priority list ahead of the general public in most states."
14774,Can someone who is smarter than me explain what this means?

14777,which vaccines?
14778,we now have several vaccines in the mix using different platforms and having different efficacies measured using different criteria and under different circumstances.
14779,perhaps we ought to stop lumping them all under the umbrella term of “covid vaccine”.

14790,"Fast forward to today, and only 25% of AZ vaccine has been used in France, the rest is sitting in fridges, vs much higher uptake for Pfizer."
14791,People are refusing the AZ vaccine when offered by their doctors.
14792,"On the flip side, you've got the Danes and the Austrians going to Israel to cut a deal for new vaccine doses, the Czechs and Slovakians ordering the Sputnik vaccine, and the Hungarians ordering both Sputnik and the Chinese one."
14793,It is safe to say the EU has failed its joint vaccine order and strategy.
14794,"Germany and France have failed the rest of the EU, they take this position of ""we're the big boiz look at us we got this EU strong"" and then they shit on the AZ  vaccine together..."

14803,Is AstraZeneca safe?
14804,In my country there is the common belief that it can make you feel very ill (more often than the other vaccines) and that also because of this it is cheap.
14805,"They say they are giving it as a ""second choice"" vaccine to people who are low-risk for covid-19."
14806,I doubt this is true but is it 100% baseless?
14807,Or there is some truth to it?
14808,Sorry I know this is an ignorant question but I'm trying to understand better.
14809,I don't know.
14810,"Most likely, they are people who are suffering from the way the world currently is."
14811,A lot of people are getting the short stick out of life today.
14812,They work long hours and get very little back from it.
14813,"They're bombarded with advertisements and propaganda from every angle, making them think they need and want things that aren't good for them."
14814,They are trying to regain some control over their lives.
14815,"These conspiracy theories give them a ""bad guy"" to focus on and a concrete way to fight it (by not taking the vaccine)."
14816,It makes them feel more powerful.
14817,It gives them the illusion that they're pulling back control of their lives in some small fashion.
14818,I understand how we got to this place... but I don't know what to do about it.
14819,I really don't.
14820,"I believe there are factors out there that are trying very hard to keep these people focused on their conspiracy theories because then they will feel like they are taking action, and they won't feel the need to take action where it really might help."
14821,"We need things like universal healthcare, higher wages, better schools, possibly even a form of basic income."
14822,"But these things hurt the corporations that are currently in charge, so they spend a lot of money and resources to keep people distracted and polarized."
14823,I had to stop going to Home Depot for that reason.
14824,"Go to Lowe’s, its much safer and cleaner."
14825,IMO it’s a political thing.
14826,They have vaccinated a lot of their people.
14827,Tens of millions.
14828,"Good points, and kind of amused that we are getting down-voted."
14829,They can get a good estimate on infection level from the sewage system because feces has relatively high concentration of Covid so public bathrooms are probably good places to catch it...
14830,Yes
14831,"Some people just want to believe the world would be better off if all pharma companies would file bankruptcy, because apparently they only do evil things and create no benefit for society."
14832,The writers totally abandoned these plothooks!
14833,"Yes, Biden won with 81,281,502 votes."
14834,"To characterize ""most"" of Biden voters, you would be referring to 40,640,752 (50% of his voters, plus 1) voters."
14835,"It is an incorrect statement to suggest that 40,640,752 of Biden voters only voted for him because he's not Trump."
14836,"Are you suggesting that those 40,640,752 Biden voters would have voted for another Republican candidate or not voted at all if Trump weren't on the ticket?"
14837,[removed]
14838,RemindMe!
14839,1 year
14840,Taking them from high risk people is unethical.
14841,Are we the baddies?
14842,This is a totally underrated response.
14843,Think of all the dead covid!
14844,Huge win for our side.
14845,Not all vaccines provide sterilizing immunity -- this is not a new thing that people made up just to be doom and gloom about covid.
14846,"&gt; it's almost all about how much

What's the units on that?"
14847,Because depending on your unit choice there's probably a strong link between what you're eating and how much of it you're eating.
14848,I'm done wasting my time with you.
14849,Hope you'll be able to deal with yourself after the variants are suppressed.
14850,I wish people would stop using this argument.
14851,It's a completely apples to oranges comparison.
14852,Bacteria and viruses are completely different beasts and giving a small amount of a antibiotic is *radically* different than having a a vaccine which exponentially increases your immune system's response and therefore exponentially decreases the viruses ability to replicate (and therefore occasionally mutate).
14853,"“keep hospitals under capacity, which we barely managed”
Yeah because the U.S never experienced an actual lockdown but that’s a whole other issue LMFAOO"
14854,Texas!
14855,Texas!
14856,Texas!
14857,Kill!
14858,Kill!
14859,Kill!
14860,"I don’t even understand what you’re writing

14868,*
14869,"Me too, I'm fortunate to have a job that doesn't require me to hang around maskless people."
14870,"I mean, my parents used to get a phone call when I didnt show up to school,  and after x number of days, if the school hadn't heard from my parents a police officer would show up at the door to see if social services needed to get involved."
14871,I guess we cant do that any more?
14872,"Thanks, very sweet of you!"
14873,"It'll likely depend on how you define ""just fine""

More people will get the virus."
14874,"Which means more deaths, more hospitalizations."
14875,The overall decline will take longer.
14876,"In the bad scenario, stuff will go up a bit before coming back down due to the vaccine takes hold."
14877,"In the worst case scenario, a new vaccine resistant strain takes hold in texas and they get royally fucked while the rest of us just get fucked."
14878,"In the best case scenario, it doesn't slow the decline too much and gets Texas a head start on its recovery."
14879,But it seems like such an unnecessary risk at this point the data strongly suggest given we're only a few months away from actually being start to reopen stuff safely.
14880,And now we all have masks which we could easily mandate during flu season to save even more lives.
14881,So what happens as soon as someone infected is a non symptomatic supper spreader in a place that had lockdowns?
14882,It spreads again.
14883,"Companies have the legal right to trespass someone off their property, so after someone is asked to leave they can just call the cops."
14884,"I've seen a few videos, it's pretty great."
14885,40 days?
14886,where are you getting this from
14887,"Whatever ""start prepping for post-vaccinated America"" is, I don't think it's what people are afraid of."
14888,"We're afraid of [""ditch all restrictions today, including masks."
14889,"""](https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/lwaz05/watch_gov_abbott_says_its_time_to_open_texas_100/)"
14890,Had restrictions been a first resort we might not be in the situation at all.
14891,And for the record I think restrictions were a last resort in the US.
14892,What state level restrictions were only implemented when doctors threaten to quit en mass.
14893,"She mentions ""new studies"" but doesn't cite them?"
14894,How is this even an article?
14895,"&gt;Britain’s Covid-19 vaccines may stop people passing on the virus “almost completely”, the head of immunisation at Public Health England has revealed."
14896,Dr Mary Ramsay said grounds for hope that vaccination may achieve the holy grail of halting community transmission were **emerging from new studies**.
14897,"“What we don’t yet know is how long that might last and whether or not that will be enough to stop the infection spreading more widely in the population over time,” she told Radio 4’s Today on Tuesday
“But there’s really very good signs that this is going to at least reduce infection rates across the population, and hopefully ... prevent people passing it on almost completely if they’ve been vaccinated fully.”"
14898,Yeah.
14899,I figured as much
14900,All this fighting over a tiny piece of cloth that one places over their mouth to keep from killing their neighbors.
14901,"There is absolutely no actual imposition here, just vice signaling and symbolism."
14902,Keep up the good work!
14903,"You can still wear two masks or a N95/equivalent, or go shopping much earlier with nobody around"
14904,What do you mean?
14905,I'm talking about official guidelines
14906,I don't understand why you're talking about in person sporting events though.
14907,"You realize the countries that have been able to hold in person sporting events are the outlier and exception, so it's disingenuous to think that Texas could have achieved the same results simply by 'listening to scientists'."
14908,China also didn’t lock down the whole country - just localities with outbreaks.
14909,"I don’t disagree with you but like you said , people will never fully comply in America - its time to move on and stop pretending government restrictions are going to help us."
14910,I’m not wearing a mask after corona is no longer a threat.
14911,"If there’s another dangerous respiratory disease going around that causes a pandemic , then absolutely."
14912,"But if everything is safe, then fuck your new normal."
14913,More like the reverse.
14914,Both are about equal though.
14915,Well my comment got deleted for being too political lol.
14916,"Cheers mate we'll see how many keep their restrictions, but I do think it's quite interesting you consider Mass a conservative state."
14917,"Except we KNOW COVID can have very long lasting and bad effects even in mild cases, yet the vaccines have shown next to none."
14918,I'll take my chances with the vaccine.
14919,"Oh man I just got my first one this morning, and have my second dose scheduled for the 29th."
14920,Any side effects from the first shot?
14921,Should I expect to take some days off work?
14922,I read this early on during the pandemic.
14923,I took advantage of not traveling for work to focus on losing weight.
14924,"I lost 57lbs going from ""Obese"" BMI to ""Healthy"" BMI."
14925,"Was hard work, but worth it...especially IRT covid."
14926,[deleted]
14927,"You try to explain that it will be over in a few months when vaccines are widely available and they just meme back “oh wait two more weeks” or “masks are forever.”

It is as if they are completely incapable of processing new information as the situation changes and are stuck in the mindset that what was said a year ago is gospel."
14928,"It’s the right time to relax restrictions a bit given cases have gone down and despite the media hype over the variants, the variants haven’t caused cases to go up."
14929,Moving to a more relaxed reopening tier is not a bad idea even if some subreddits won’t agree in all likelihood.
14930,However what Texas is doing here is pretty irresponsible and far too soon.
14931,"For one, the states that have reopened a bit but not too far still maintain mask mandates which Texas is getting rid off."
14932,"All good, it's understandable when you're frustrated."
14933,It's just super helpful if comments like that get reported so we're guaranteed to see them :)
14934,&gt; What an unforgivable miss this vaccine rollout has been.
14935,"Could be a lot worse... Look at Europe, Canada, and well many other places."
14936,"Side effects aren't universal, my parents both had it and were fine."
14937,70% will probably never happen...
14938,"Based on what you're saying, it sounds like many people aren't following the mandates."
14939,"If it's like my state (we don't have a mask mandate), about 60% of the people wear one and the rest don't."
14940,I'm guessing there's a pretty high correlation between people that refuse to wear a mask with a mandate vs won't wear one without a mandate.
14941,This is fantastic news.
14942,Hopefully the first world will recover and all the other parts of the world will soon follow.
14943,Go science!
14944,"&gt;valid argument for the fact the idiots beat us to herd immunity

idiots also got a lot of people killed that wouldn't have if everybody acted responsibly."
14945,"I hope eating a shitty mcdonalds burger inside the restaurant instead of at home, and going to walmart without an *oppressive piece of fabric* was worth all the death."
14946,Would you happen to know why that happens?
14947,"I've seen it, but I haven't ever figured out/seen a good reason for it."
14948,"&amp;#x200B;

Edit: (for other people) [https://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/covid-vaccine-tracker-global-distribution/](https://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/covid-vaccine-tracker-global-distribution/) shows the ""slump"" pretty clearly."
14949,How many people are you willing to kill so you can go out clubbing without a mask?
14950,"https://championtraveler.com/news/the-us-flu-season-is-bad-this-year-but-influenza-is-still-way-more-deadly-around-the-world/

Japan and Korea have by far the worst flu deaths of any first world nation."
14951,Only a few European nations come even in their league.
14952,"I lol every time I hear ""Well in Japan they wear masks!!!"""
14953,Ok........are you saying that to draw attention to the fact they don't work?
14954,?
14955,"I'm a big mask person but honestly, probably nothing."
14956,So much spread is from small personal gatherings where people don't have masks on anyways.
14957,In NY everyone is wearing a mask but we have the highest cases per 100k right now.
14958,I thought mask wearing was voluntary in South Korea.
14959,Social pressure to conform does more than government mandates over there
14960,The UK did not follow medical recommendations early and it cost them significantly.
14961,Italy was hit first and without the benefit of knowledge other countries had for later containment.
14962,Spain I'm less familiar with.
14963,"what you're practicing right now is cherry picking, which is a little reckless considering that you aren't really taking into account how those countries reacted to it."
14964,You're just quantifying everything as either the United States or not the United States while ignoring that there were countries outside the United States that also did handle this poorly.
14965,[deleted]
14966,No thanks what?
14967,This isn’t a political decision.
14968,This isn’t something that can be negotiated.
14969,It comes down to how the majority of people and businesses are behaving as well as the physical reality of the virus.
14970,There’s no thing you can grab onto.
14971,We are all just watching.
14972,There isn’t even any conflict.
14973,There’s no way to negotiate or vote your way to the kind of life you want any more than you can vote your way out of a rain storm
14974,Masks aren't required outdoors (and they shouldn't be).
14975,"It's still possible that it is difficult-but-not-impossible to catch covid by surface contamination, but it's a low bar and that in reality, we are reliably eliminating like 10% of potential low-hangin-fruit transmission cases by these sanitation practices."
14976,&gt;this is seemingly what the majority of Texan voters want.
14977,Have you got some polling data to support that?
14978,How many deaths are you morally willing to accept in order for us all to move on with our lives?
14979,Because people aren't fucking following the rules.

15006,Wearing a mask is the fucking worst especially when you have to wear one for hours and hours at work.
15007,Especially when everyone at work is vaccinated anyway it just feels like a waste.
15008,No.
15009,Ah yes - I took a train through Brno once.
15010,I wouldn't call it pseudoscience either - I think we should test anything that's predicted to be useful.

15026,I think he could phrase it better by saying vaccinations will be at an acceptable level by around May that lifting all restrictions wouldn't be big deal unless you're a die hard lockdown person
15027,This is good advice.
15028,The masking of asymptomatic (read: not sick) people didn't kill off the flu.

15116,He then later said he lied.
15117,Again that is what Fauci said.
15118,He said he has ALWAYS KNOWN masks work but he had to lie to not cause a panic and PPE shortage for healthcare workers.
15119,Again this is what FAUCI himself says.
15120,Now the better question is why Fauci who is 79 has spent his **entire career saying masks don't work but he now claims he has ALWAYS known they work**.
15121,Be great of a reporter would ask Fauci to explain it.
15122,"Guess you didn't check on the 30,000 people who aren't still alive down there"
15123,[removed]
15124,Well Gregg Abbott is a moron
15125,That’s for sure.
15126,That’s why I’m going to continue to do curb side pickup at my local grocery.
15127,"For me it’s “these trying times”

Social distancing was great for me."
15128,I have social anxiety.
15129,That is one thing that I didn't even think about but makes sense.
15130,Not ever having a sore throat or cold this last year has been pretty great.
15131,Prolly going to just keep on masking on.
15132,No one is making you go into public places.
15133,And these mitigation efforts were designed to flatten (but elongate) the curve of the virus spread.
15134,"So no, if anything this could make the mess shorter."
15135,"March 8, 2020 Fauci said there is no reason to wear a mask."
15136,Sorry if that hurts your feelings.
15137,"Ah yes, mock my very very real concerns about something that could actually happen"
15138,[removed]
15139,A grocery store has no way of knowing if someone is healthy or not.
15140,Hence the need to require masks to be safe.
15141,Meanwhile it sounds like the mask is successfully keeping the snot on the kid rather than spreading it elsewhere which means its working just as planned.
15142,"Meanwhile, wearing a mask prevents none of the stuff you wanted to do."
15143,Making it even more clear your objections to mask wearing have nothing to do with reality but instead are just your own internal selfishness preventing you from doing a harmless act that can save lives.
15144,Texas continues to exist despite itself
15145,They hated him cause he told the truth.
15146,Edit: I truly don't understand why people love lockdowns.
15147,I have family members who lost decades worth of business progress from strict lockdowns; only for the state to do worse than florida in the end.
15148,"Lockdowns cause increased stress, mental illnesses, and etc.."
15149,They're literally no benefits to a lockdown unless you're a small island in the pacific.
15150,Cool.
15151,2 sparsely populated island countries.
15152,I am talking about the vast majority of countries on earth.
15153,That are still dealing with it and weren't able to just eradicate COVID from mask wearing and lockdowns.
15154,In fact NZ just entered another lockdown recently and Iceland still has strict travel restrictions and community spread.
15155,So not really sure how those 2 locations contradict what I said.
15156,Florida is middle of the pack on deaths.
15157,Get your facts straight.
15158,"Nothing gained, nothing lost"
15159,This is awesome.
15160,Time to let folks decide their own risk factor.
15161,All the big box stores will still require masks anyways.
15162,[removed]
15163,"If you don’t live in a healthcare setting and you’re fully vaccinated, you don’t have to quarantine upon a covid exposure, according to the CDC."
15164,And I didn't like the ending 😔
15165,[removed]
15166,I didn’t know muscular dystrophy was a symptom of covid.
15167,"I think we need to keep everyone under house arrest because you have a relative that died though, that seems reasonable."

15169,"For God's sake, Manaus never reached herd immunity, nor has any city reached it through ""natural"" means."
15170,The 70% stats were hugely overblown due to faulty studies and political pressure to reopen most business in the city.
15171,"Restrictions and masks are why those numbers are not double, triple, or worse."
15172,"Your life maybe tied to materialism and looking for a way to justify mass homicide, but mine is not."
15173,"If you know people in panhandle, Tallahassee check out walmar."
15174,"If you know people in first coast (Jax metro area), there’s plenty through Winn Dixie."

15177,Stupid
15178,Thank goodness for those scientists
15179,"Well, at least that will keep me from going to bars."
15180,Thanks for the excuse to stay away from people while it lasted covid
15181,[removed]
15182,Have you ever flown on a plane?
15183,it seems most people are still wearing masks even if the state does not require it.
15184,"If anything, companies have more leeway to make mistakes now, because they can blame the need of a rushed vaccine due to a pandemic."
15185,"As for their history, after reading those lawsuits, I would be concerned."
15186,"As you said, risky business."
15187,"Companies can still choose to enforce it on their property however, just like they can choose to enforce other clothing."
15188,[removed]
15189,"Yeah, I have a relative that died."
15190,I know of two acquaintances that literally had to learn...to...walk...again.
15191,"I’ll take my chances on Netflix and living my life, have fun at the health club."

15196,Plrasepleasepleasepleasepleasepleasepleass
15197,How are you still so uninformed about that now-debunked statement by Fauci?
15198,"Cases spike, possibly a new variant could come about and render everything useless."
15199,"Its more likely since more people are travelling

Any time people try to be rational and talk about the VERY REAL possibility of something bad happening due to opening up too early is just labeled as a crazy person and someone who wants this to go on

If i lose out of my last year at college because people wanna go party im gonna be pissed."
15200,I missed out already on SO MUCH
15201,"We had to argue about which economic system was good, and which was the spawn of Satan, and had to show off our spying powers though."
15202,Your first sentence tells me you're not arguing your point in good faith.

15204,"When the 4th wave staggers Texas and makes it shut down again, do remember that they can't handle snow, hurricanes or masks."
15205,Won't you?
15206,[removed]
15207,"""M"" alone sometimes means thousand, like in Roman Numerals, so ""MM"" is used to unambiguously write million."
15208,By this rationale you should wear a mask for the rest of your life when near other people.
15209,You never know when you may have an asymptomatic case of the cold.
15210,Loony stuff man.
15211,"For once, I'm actually glad I live in Florida."
15212,"At least wait until everyone has access to the vaccine before doing a 100% reopening, that's the least any governor can do."

15214,"My local dive bar got renovated during covid, I'm pissed."
15215,Thx
15216,"Yes, he's potentially ruined his political career just so he can enjoy enforcing these mask mandates."
15217,there wasnt a vaccine out before.
15218,Now there is and the finish line is in clear sight
15219,[removed]
15220,Actually there are plenty of good reasons not to wear a mask.
15221,We socialize through our facial cues.
15222,Masks impinge on that ability.
15223,"Also, my wife teaches 1st grade and let me tell you, a 7 year old's mask can become one of the nastiest things you've ever seen."
15224,They suck on them.
15225,They wipe their snotty nose on the inside.
15226,They put them in filthy places then back onto their faces.
15227,"Finally, what you're describing is the ""harmless"" masking of people who show no symptoms of any kind of disease."
15228,You know... healthy people.
15229,Taking a healthy person and pretending they're sick is a psychological disorder known as Munchausen syndrome.
15230,Humans are social creatures.
15231,The sooner we stop treating each other like potential disease vectors the better.
15232,I want to hug friends.
15233,I want to shake a stranger's hand when I first meet them.
15234,I want to have food out that everyone at the party can just graze on.
15235,And you know what?
15236,I'm going to!
15237,And you can sit in isolation and pout about how selfish everyone is being and that's just fine too!
15238,The thing I will miss is working from home.
15239,WFH has been wonderful
15240,"And Iowa, and the Dakotas, and Tennessee, etc."
15241,The predicted apocalypse has failed to materialize in any of those states.
15242,"In fact, they’re all doing pretty well right now."
15243,"Don’t want to go international, just an island kingdom we took over thousands of miles out in the pacific."
15244,My only hope is they increase eligibility to meet supply.
15245,Vaccinations as quickly as possible should be the goal
15246,Exactly
15247,No one said you can’t continue to hermit with your netflix and doordash.
15248,You just can’t make everyone live in the same hellscape.
15249,My condolences.
15250,[removed]
15251,"Nah, fat-shaming is just a way for fatasses to justify being a literal and figurative load on society."
15252,You can’t spread it after you’ve been vaccinated.
15253,That’s been proven.
15254,The US is so close to breaking the 2 million vaccines administered per day milestone (I count 1.94 million a day over the last week).
15255,"And during WW1 they just went
THHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHE
GRRRRRRRREEEEEEEEAAAAAATTTTTTTTTTTT
WAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAR"
15256,"Well I mean lives are tied to the ""economy""."
15257,"But the point is we don't even need to have the argument because the ""heavy restriction"" states didn't save any COVID lives."
15258,"This is COVID deaths per million by state Top-3

2626 -New Jersey

2469-New York

Rhode Island-2384


Here is a good one:

California vs Texas vs Florida

1328           1524     1450


CA is PROBABLY going to pass FL in deaths by end of month as their recent outbreak in terms was far worse than FL's (looking at hospitalization and case data adjusted for population)


Restrictions/masks have failed miserably."
15259,My windows have always remained open as far as they go whenever people are in my classroom.
15260,I have four relatively large windows that open with one of them being occupied by an exhaust fan.
15261,On days with a breeze coming from a certain direction I wouldn't be surprised if I exceed the recommended air changes by a huge margin.
15262,Yes it's been cold.
15263,I have almost entirely stopped enforcement of the school dress code and allowed the students to wear coats and hats.
15264,On the coldest days this year my school called virtual learning days.
15265,I am so thankful that my admin has been willing to listen to the science and respect the ideas of the teachers.
15266,I really hope we get a massive push to renovate existing buildings.
15267,If this isn't the wake up call people needed I don't know what else would do it.
15268,So many teachers in this country don't even have windows that open in their classrooms and the schools don't have any form of a ventilation system.
15269,I feel for them and  it really isn't fair.
15270,"Yep, ""another couple of months we could really end this thing"" has been going on for half a year already"
15271,"It will undermine the confidence of a lot of people, but what I understood from the time I spent there was that a lot (most?)"
15272,people hate Macron and criticize everything he has to say.
15273,"The best and main difference between this year and last year is actually having multiple vaccines that are approved, and currently being distributed."
15274,"Last year we spent the whole time waiting for a vaccine, with many steps ahead of us still."
15275,"I am proud of everybody who made it through last year, and this very dark winter."
15276,"&gt; prolong everything 

How's that?"
15277,[removed]
15278,[removed]
15279,I mean i figured this was obvious.
15280,-The virus has no carrier species to hide on.
15281,-The vaccine cuts transmission by 80% at worst last I heard.
15282,"This is going to put transmission rates below 1 for sure, then it's a just a matter of time before it's gone."
15283,&gt; never think about it again.
15284,unlikely
15285,"Nah by the time summer comes and everyone has a chance to get the vaccine, I’m done with this."
15286,I’m done not having a college experience or being able to travel.
15287,"At some point, enough will be enough."
15288,This has gone on long enough.
15289,"NYC has indoor dining and the streets are busy, people are out."
15290,"I'm happy to see that, but don't act like NYC is nearly as locked down anymore."
15291,"I don't know, I don't really pay attention to other states but looks like they have around 30k deaths and average about 5,000 new cases per day."
15292,"Slaoui predicted the United States would have 100,000,000 doses out there by March 1."
15293,"I don't recall if he specifically said administered or distributed, but people considered it completely absurd to believe it could happen."
15294,It looks like he was right.
15295,We did it.
15296,Wave 3 is going to be a blast
15297,Decision was clearly made by his political campaign and not health experts
15298,Texas did early reopenings last year around June.
15299,It didn't work out well.
15300,"It took them from around 2000 daily cases up to 15,000 in only a few weeks."
