6,But I am somehow forced to new treated by someone who doesn't believe in medical research and medical science...
7,If I have to live like this for the next five years I’m gonna take a bath with my toaster

12,"""Good news?"""
13,"Yeah, and they'll only decrease in the next few months because flu season is almost over and more people will be going out and getting vitamin D. No miracles here.."
14,"All I’m seeing after that is:

&gt;&gt; Early reports found no evidence to suggest that the variant has any impact on the severity of disease or vaccine efficacy."
15,"Aka early, it’s kind of one of those “We are going to put this here just incase it doesn’t happen, but we are going to put it here just in case in does too.” 

We shall see."
16,"Either way, glad that they at least acknowledged this threat so I don’t feel totally crazy for being overprotective to my elderly, with health conditions, parents."

52,"January 2021 world leaders: ""We dont have any scientific proof to shut down airports, or close stadiums, or do anything."
53,"Because we cant close the economy with no scientific proof""

You only can get scientific proof if more people die and you can get the numbers, this is how it works with virus."
54,"Not scientific proof yet, but outbreak with UK variant in a residencial building in Spain ends with 11 neighbors dead and more in the ICU."
55,How many people aren't insured in the US?
56,What's the percentage?
57,Why do you keep pushing this lie that people aren't happy (or satisfied) with their healthcare?
58,Like what is your aim in pushing this lie?

64,Do I still have to wear a mask if I got vaxed?
65,Tell that to the grieving parents
66,I can see the quote in your post history anyways.
67,It literally does not say that.
68,"It is saying people who aren't uninsured are ""satisfied"" with their health insurance coverage."
69,"As someone who certifies things as ""satisfactory"" for a living, that word means ""meets minimum requirements""."
70,"It's a low bar, not remotely the same thing as being pleased, or as you say, happy, with something."
71,"That's also specifically about *insurance*, for those who are insured."
72,"Which we are allowed to choose, at least where I work."
73,"Not ""the healthcare system""."
74,"Similar polls that ask questions about the system shows a near universal expression of displeasure varying from finding it mildly problematic to thinking it's in complete crisis, even pre pandemic."
75,"I live in Florida, there really is no reason to believe they're lying about number of people testing positive."
76,"Every individual testing site keeps track of their own data, if Florida was understating our numbers it would be obvious by now."
77,"Besides, we're having a VERY high number of positives, its certainly nothing to be proud of."
78,"If we were lying, we'd have way lower numbers to encourage tourism since thats the bread and butter of our economy"
79,&gt; Unfortunately that just means the EUs delivery schedule is not being met.
80,"So, breach of contract...?"
81,You cut just before the next sentence lol.

83,That second paragraph is me.
84,Most days I’m fine.

88,By area.
89,"&gt;&gt; In January 2021, scientists from UK reported evidence[1] that suggests the B.1.1.7 variant may be associated with an increased risk of death compared with other variants."
90,"Most of the time when I see updates on their page, its to acknowledge the possibility of it being true."
91,Seeing as the study done by the UK had 95% CI for every test.
92,“It also bothers me that some people think this vaccine campaign is about removing their personal health anxiety around COVID.
93,It's not.
94,It's about ending a public health crisis.
95,"Even after the crisis over, there will still be a non zero risk of contracting COVID or another respiratory infection that could cause complications."
96,We all have a right to live in a world without a massive public health crisis.
97,However anyone saying that they have a right to live in a world without any health risks is living in a delusion that will never be and never was real.
98,None of us have a right to a world without risk of sickness.
99,"That never existed and never will.”

Can we figure out the technology to automatically post these two paragraphs on all of the computers/phones/TVs/tablets in the world at least once a day?"

121,At this point; I bet the entire world is asking “what the f:&amp;@ is wrong you US?”
122,"In the US at least, you can tell just by looking at the number of new cases."
123,It's been on a steady decline since the start of the year.
124,A bigger dip than any other point in the timeline.
125,So crazy to think there are places that didn’t have restaurants at all.

152,"Plus no commute is wonderful for my sleep

The main issue to me is that life outside of work has been crushed significantly."
153,I want to be able to go out and do things freely like I used to.
154,"The vaccines are already proving to cut down transmission among vaccinated people and presumably the unvaccinated as well, just look at what's going on in Israel."
155,"As more and more vaccinated people start mixing in with the rest of society and transmission rates start going down and staying down, it's bye-bye, long COVID."
156,It can’t ‘come back’ if it’s always there
157,3 months from now California is not going to look ‘very close to normal’ with ‘minimal if any restrictions’ lol.

163,"The one from Brazil is very similar to the South African one, so my educated guess says the vaccines will be similarly effective."
164,It would take *several* mutations like the SA and BR variants have on the same virus to escape immunity completely.

283,"Once the majority of older people get vaccinated, it’s time to go back to normal."
284,&gt;Why would they?
285,That has to be done at the local level.
286,I actually thought that too until I saw how badly some states fucked up.
287,Look up the percentages vaccinated per state vs vaccines distributed to each state.
288,When you have people dying who could qualify for the vaccine there is no reason a vaccine should sit unused in a warehouse.
289,Every state is different but surely the federal government can just come up with the best plan for all states that also has some flexibility for differences per state.
290,"You seriously doubt that vaccines that confer such significant immunity across all main variants means ""we're all fucked""?"
291,That doesn't make any sense.
292,"And if it truly mutates to something we need to develop against: [New vaccines are 'highly adaptable' and can be tweaked against COVID-19 variants, experts say](https://abc7news.com/covid-19-vaccine-virus-variants-moderna-pfizer/10043873/)."

296,"I’m an Australian and tomorrow I’ll be going back to school, we won’t be required to wear masks unless we can’t stay physically distanced, but other than that school is more or less back to normal, this is because my country and specially my state locked down for 111 days, so for roughly 60 missed school days we were able to protect our young and old lives, and get our lives back to normal whilst the rest of the world scrambles to have enough beds for people to die in."
297,"School is important, protecting people against Covid is more important."
298,Idk about that.
299,What policies are you referring to?
300,Agreed.
301,"If back to normal means exactly as it was in 2019, then yeah, we'll never be back to normal."
302,"If it means until Covid vaccines aren't required to get a passport, then probably decades at least."
303,"Personally, 'back to normal' is when we're able to lift local restrictions and mask mandates."

305,Yeah they blocked it to prevent people.
306,They are crazy.
307,Its like people who take abortion clinics hostage.
308,They dont believe in freedom.
309,They scream their freedom and inhibit others in the worst way.

&gt;If they provide evidence that they screwed up production, I’m satisfied."
317,"Sure, but the jury is still out on that one, AZ may be forced to go public on that one since so far it's the EU that has proven they are willing to lie to try to cover their assess when it comes to AZ agreement."
318,"So far the EU has shown itself to be a mess by not only screwing up procurement, but now lashing out and threatening trade wars against the UK, Canada and Australia, not to mention breaching the GFA, before someone there came to their senses."

333,"I still wore a mask where required, but I never really worried about it because I was never anywhere that I would really need one."
334,It meant that I could focus my energy much better than people who are walking around in vague fear that the virus is going to get them walking in the park.
335,"With respect to work environments, though, you are absolutely right."
336,And it's hard not to conclude that the reason the CDC and the WHO have de-emphasized environmental and exposure factors is they decided early on that there was no way many people could safely work...and they didn't want that message out there.
337,It's frustrated me also.
338,"So much wasted effort, and misplaced guilt tripping, about COVID spreading because people weren't properly implementing protocols that weren't that sustainable, or effective, in the first place."
339,That's nearly half the country....
340,"WaPo is garbage on COVID stuff, and is basically owned by Amazon, which has benefited greatly from people being stuck at home all year

341,I would understand if they were protesting for better stimulus checks but pro-virus people blocking vaccination sites is unbelievable.
342,What the fuck is so hard about wearing a damn mask?
343,Covid is preventable though?

345,He literally can't find 20 million doses of the vaccine because no one was actually tracking them.
346,He's had 10 days to clean up a giant mess that has been brewing for weeks now.
347,"There needed to be a clear plan in place months ago, before the vaccines were approved."
348,We knew which ones went into phase 3 testing- a plan should have been tailored  for each vaccine that went into phase 3.
349,"Also, the FEMA sites may make a huge difference, especially if he is able to get all 100 running"
350,Thread it anyway you want.
351,California has had more of their 65+ people die per capita than Florida.
352,It's pretty simple math.
353,You’re right.
354,~100% is probably overselling a bit.
355,With more data as it gets rolled out we’ll have a better idea.
356,"Regardless, like you said, we’re on our way to getting this under control."
357,"you’re just out here trying to not create children you’ve got to look after for those extra 6 hours a day, grow up and take some responsibility, take your kids hiking or camping if you’re worried about them being bubble children instead of sending them to school and putting them at risk of death, although I suppose that’d be a win for you a nice life insurance payout and daycare for 24 hours a day instead of the normal 6 school gives you."

520,The neutralizing antibodies produced in response to Moderna’s vaccine were equally effective against the original coronavirus and the B.1.1.7 strain that emerged in the United Kingdom but were far less effective against the South Africa strain.

554,My argument was that the U.K.‘s vaccines that were bottled in Belgium had 0 impact on the EU’s supplies.
555,"Those vaccines had already been created, just the last process of bottling them into individual vials was done in Belgium."
556,"The vaccine itself had already been created in the U.K., so obviously bottling it in the EU has 0 impact on the EU’s supply."
557,Some of the best scientists working in systems where bureaucracy stifles science.
558,It’s no surprises that it’s the US and the U.K. out of all major economies that are doing well at creating vaccines &amp; rolling them out.
559,"The EU is too bureaucratic, slow and lacks forward thinking."
560,Scientists also don’t get the same levels of funding in most European countries as they would in the Anglosphere.
561,And what are you on about regarding funding?
562,The majority of the funding was allocated by the governments Vaccine Taskforce in April and May of 2020.
563,"And the EU didn’t fund the vaccine per se, they just placed an early order."
564,It’s a tit for tat.
565,The U.K. govt on the other hand provided funding to develop the vaccine in addition to their orders.

575,Australia has also implemented the use of 'hotspots' and 'bubbles' to limit travel from particular places with community covid spread while allowing travel from safer areas.

765,It’s an IQ/education issue (IQ tends to reflect being able to see bigger picture and how things are interconnected and education teaches these people about those connections when they don’t make them naturally).
766,"If anything, individualist thinking drives that type of approach of questioning everything and taking nothing for granted and testing every hypothesis to see if it breaks, because individuals who exist outside institutions or collective identities can do these actions without social or emotional consequences, ie, being shunned from the group (think of the Middle Ages when religion dictated all aspects of life in the west, which was slowly over time discarded in favor of greater questioning, exploring, and scientific discovery all rooted in individualism)."

Please don't lecture on a subject you don't understand."
919,"Yes, mutations happen constantly, most of them are detrimental to the virus and don't spread."
920,Only the mutations that benefit the virus do.
921,"Working around a vaccine (as is working around antibiotics) comes with a price to the virus, in a vaccine free environment that cost outweigh the benefits and the mutation doesn't spread."
922,However the same mutation happening in a partially vaccinated country may make the variant more successful as it enjoys a large number of hosts with exclusivity where the normal strand cannot compete.
923,Thus allowing a spread.
924,A partially vaccinated population puts a pressure on the virus to favor mutations that circumvent said vaccine.
925,Novavax hasn’t even finished enrollment for their US trial (which is required for the FDA to even consider it).

1157,The pfizer/moderna already provide excellent efficiency at 95% which is groundbreaking.
1158,A third shot could possibly bump it up slightly but like its not gonns bump it up to 100% efficiency and considering its at 95% is another shot really worth it to gain a potential extra 2-4% efficiency though?
1159,At thst point it won't really provide much real world benefit so you're better of sticking with 2 doses.
1160,J&amp;J is testing 2 doses but results won't be due yet for some time hence why they went and released the 1 dose results since that efficiency is still good enough in terms of ending the pandemic.
1161,Hard to say if 2 doses will provide a significant improvement in efficiency since it's a different vaccine also to pfizer/moderna.
1162,And i think it's a more similar vaccine to AZ which is 2 doses and 60-70% efficient.
1163,So i mean going on that it may 2 doses doesn't provide much benefit maybe.

So with about full vaccine immunity response, you have 473 cases which resulted in 2 deaths and 38 current hospitalisations after 7 days which amounts to 0.4% and 8.0%."
1199,"This can be compared to the group 0-13 days after a first dose, so non-existent or low immunity from the vaccine, where those were 4.3% and 11.9%, and infection rate was 1.05% vs 0.07%."

1272,You clearly have no idea what long term side effects means do you?
1273,The virus arrived in 2020.
1274,It can take years for long term side effects to occur in humans.
1275,You don’t get liver failure from drinking only once and you don’t just develop it in one day.
1276,You can get COPD from smoking even though you quit 10 years ago.
1277,You are at a greater risk of getting shingles as an adult if you don’t contract chicken pox as a child.
1278,Your right I don’t have kids but that doesn’t mean I didn’t grow up with 5 siblings.
1279,I went to school and dedicate my life to working for big Pharma.
1280,Again that is where you are completely wrong.
1281,Children are only low risk in the sense that if they get Covid they don’t need to be hospitalized.
1282,Covid in children and young adults is asymptomatic meaning they 100% can contract Covid and give others Covid while displaying absolutely ZERO symptoms that an Adult with Covid would have.
1283,I hate to tell you but there is absolutely ZERO scientific evidence that states once teachers are vaccinated that schools magically become safe.
1284,Like I said before covid keeps creating multiple variants.
1285,Meaning your child can go to school and help develop a Covid variant that isn’t protected under the current vaccine.
1286,This means one day your kid can come home and be completely fine but little do you know just gave you and your entire family Covid that is not protected under the current vaccine.
1287,If you cause this to happen I can promise you it will be 2020 all over again and everything will shut down until they can develop a new vaccine.
1288,Moving “goal posts” is called adaptive learning.
1289,This means when we learn new info about the virus we need to adjust our goals to keep people safe and avoid a repeat of 2020

1304,If they get emboldened you just have to punch harder :)
1305,&gt; I disagree.
1306,Now what?
1307,I mean it’s not really a matter of opinion.
1308,"You are factually, objectively incorrect."
1309,That’s good to hear then.
1310,Hopefully all will go well and the distribution won’t be a shitfest like it is with the current vaccine.
1311,It is very likely that masks will have to be worn in winter for years to come as we fight against new mutations.
1312,"Note, Japan hasn't updated the number of PCR tests performed since January 28th, which tends to suggest that the number of tests may be lower than average (which is usually around 50,000 to 60,000 per day)."
1313,Many of us on the pro-vaccine side will not tolerate ridiculous criteria for restrictions.
1314,It could be a poor political maneuver if they decide to pick such a criteria.

1325,"And time, as we’ve already seen from the way the virus spreads (especially variants that will continue to dominate due to increased selection pressure), is not on our side."

1471,That’s not true.
1472,As recent studies have shown the variants are causing the vaccines to be less effective.
1473,Now they are still effective enough to control the spread but the mRNA vaccines which we’ve heard quoted as 95% efficacy are almost certainly significantly below that with the South Africa and South America variants based on initial studies.

1574,Get this.
1575,Just talked to my aunt - one of her coworkers who told them not to get it and was all about the chip and tracking.... just signed up and got the vaccine.
1576,Has she posted about it on her fb where she goes off about not taking it.
1577,Nope.
1578,Soooo maybe this is a sign that some of the crazies are coming around.
1579,"I was shocked, glad she took it but then annoyed she was so crazy against it and now has it and I’d do anything to get it lol."
1580,Hopefully she can persuade some of her other crazy friends to get it too.
1581,Thought I’d update as I was shocked to hear it.
1582,"Yes sorry, you may have misinterpreted."

1590,Testing all over the place.
1591,Very true.. but I’m also not hearing of any one getting serious symptoms these days compared to say April or June.
1592,"For everyone who did say, they tested positive.. they just said it was a slight fever and they were better after 3 weeks."

1595,At the start of this most manufacturers agreed deals to collaborate based on spreading the risk their own research would not produce a viable vaccine.
1596,The world wide demand is larger than any of them can fill.
1597,They've insisted on releasing their vaccine in Q4.
1598,I don't even know how the want to run trials when large parts of the population will be vaccinated in summer.

1606,Couldn't find any info in the hebrew articles too
1607,They say it prevents 85% of severe Covid.
1608,That is a bullshit number.
1609,How do they know that the 85% who did not develop severe Covid would have without the vaccine.
1610,Clearly they can’t know that.
1611,The vaccine is a sham and the FDA will have no choice but to reject it.
1612,Are you actually that dense?
1613,The greatest tragedy in American history where thousands of people died in 9/11 is happening every single day over there and you say it's not deadly enough to be taken seriously?
1614,"I hope none of your friends or family get the disease, it's a horrible way to die."
1615,Although maybe then you'll see just how serious it is and stop spreading your dangerous misinformation.
1616,support personnel are vaccinated.
1617,Sanofi's vaccine failed it's trials.
1618,They either produce some other companies or they can't sell any vaccine.

1631,Yeah the media is a big fucking joke in Australia.
1632,Its pretty much just America 2.0 when it comes to that.
1633,I wouldn't even be surprised if the Liberals win by a larger margin than last time because of the perceived amazing job at controllng the virus (when it was literally just the state governments doing the heavy lifting).
1634,I can ask 6 nurses which are living in my dorm that are taking there practicals (not sure the word in English) and they say it's not much more than normal considering less people want to go to the hospitals.
1635,But i guess it's different in different regions of the country.
1636,You guys are so much smarter and better than everybody.
1637,Wow much good.
1638,"My point here was about lockdowns and you show a graph from Finland, so I just assumed it was related."
1639,Seems it was not
1640,Everyone has lost some.
1641,But if you had no lockdown then it's not that bad indeed.
1642,I wasn't in the pub since December.
1643,Doesn't mean we do not meet in my friend's place tho.
1644,We were able to enforce our internal borders effectively when each state had a COVID outbreak.
1645,Ah yes the way he mocked people that wear masks and refused to coordinate a federal vaccination plan were both great responses
1646,"which year, is the bigger question"
1647,There are so much talk about population but I don't think thats a contributing factor.

1649,2 hours delay isn't funny.
1650,Do you stay and risk being infected by one of the anti-vaxers.
1651,Or go away and add travel time to those 2 hours.
1652,I moved to Victoria 5 years ago and got an email from transperth today saying mask use is now mandatory over there.

1689,The real uk death toll is estimated to be OVER 140k btw.

1815,He or she is not keeping this up until 2023 because there are cases in Ukraine.
1816,good
1817,I will absolutely scorn them for flying and risking infection while the vaccine is just starting to take effect because if enough people do that we will likely end up with resistant strains.
1818,That's like someone jumping in a lifeboat and then un-hitching it from the sinking ship before anyone else gets in despite having 9 open seats and not knowing how to row.
1819,"I'm not going to give them an ""attaboy"" just for knowing that the ship was going down and where the lifeboats happen to be located."
1820,Nobody deserves a pat on the back for prioritizing their survival over that of others.
1821,These vaccines are ridiculously effective and we have the data to prove it.
1822,Now get in line.
1823,"If you can afford to fly, you can afford to hunker down for a few more weeks."
1824,Ah thanks.
1825,Also supports the case that most states base restrictions on hospitalizations
1826,[deleted]
1827,A lot of people who have recovered from covid still have trouble breathing and might be affected in the long run
1828,But 9 million more doses than the original cut in supply.
1829,So it's a start
1830,"Despite an overall decrease in hospitalizations, there may be hotspots which need a rapid ramp-up of capacity."
1831,Local facilities are preferable above airlifts to other cities or states.
1832,Should ask them for some help seeing as they were the first and only country Canada looked to partner with.
1833,Don't want to end up with vaccines from that third world country with a Gucci belt now do you.
1834,The preliminary data from Israel shows it's working.
1835,In the UK they say they will have data (on infection rate) for the UK in two weeks.
1836,It will take more time to see that reflected in hospitalisation and even longer for reflection in deaths.
1837,So we might only see true drops in deaths in a month or more.
1838,"Well, it started when it was decided without consulting the European people that we needed federalism and another layer of political bloat on top of the political bloat we already have."
1839,Thanks for elaborating on that!

1854,"&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Racial tensions are high \[in the US\] and there's deep rooted division within the nation."
1855,"&amp;#x200B;

I suppose the only difference between the US and China in that regard is that the Han Chinese are in a position of complete dominance over their minorities, and its politicians over its population in general, or China would reveal itself to be very divided as well:

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethnic\_issues\_in\_China#Modern\_China](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethnic_issues_in_China#Modern_China)

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;The standard of living in  the U.S hasn't really changed all that much in the meantime for the  average person."
1856,"Infrastructure is shit while higher education and  medicare is only affordable to the top 10% of the society \[...\]

&amp;#x200B;

I would again point out that you are solely focused on negative comparisons with America, when other countries are just as appropriate as a point of comparison, i.e."
1857,"Germany, Canada, South Korea."
1858,America does have deep seated economic problems because it has never provided the same level of welfare as most other developed democracies.
1859,"I readily admit that and America's other failings but you can't say the same of all, or even most, capitalist / democratic countries, so that hardly counts in favour of socialist autocracies."
1860,"&amp;#x200B;

&gt;China:  no wars other than when its borders/sovereignty are at risk of being  violated."
1861,"No killing, no invasion, no interference in other country's  internal affairs."
1862,"&amp;#x200B;

You need to stop giving me softballs, this one is so easy to knock out of the park you're starting to make me feel like a professional."
1863,"China had no justifiable reason to seize Tibet, Xinjiang or Inner Mongolia in the early days of the CCP, it's borders were not at risk it just wanted more power, resources and control (the annexation of Tibet flatly contradicts your points)."
1864,"Equally, at this point in time China has no place trying to invade Taiwan, which poses no military threat and has been a culturally, politically and geographically distinct country for almost a century (although they frequently threaten this)."
1865,"&amp;#x200B;

China may have confined exercises of military power to its borders (and neighboring territories) but that is only because in the early days of the CCP it did not have the military power to project its interests at distance (New Zealand also didn't occupy its nearest neighbours for the same reason)."
1866,"After the early days of expansion - Xinjiang, Inner Mongolia, Tibet - it had more than enough territory and problems to look after without fighting far flung wars."
1867,"China also has a ridiculous habit of disputing territory with almost all of its neighbours, especially in the Indo-Pacific Ocean, where it's territorial claims are absurd and have been rejected flatly by the Hague Court."
1868,It is not hard to see that China creates conflict with its neighbours by pushing unnecessary and unfounded territorial claims (hiding behind the idea of border disputes to justify its crimes).
1869,This is hardly a meaningful defense since China is the aggressor in almost 100% of these cases.
1870,"&amp;#x200B;

&gt;I  do not see how China's system is performing worse."
1871,Do you?
1872,"&amp;#x200B;

Yes, I do."
1873,China would have become rich almost whatever form of governance it chose.
1874,"China did not lift itself up by its own bootstraps, it did not engineer its way out of poverty, it's system of governance didn't surpass that of other countries and thereby produce unrivaled results."
1875,"Foreign countries invested in China and this massively changed the country (the same is true of Japan after WW2), but China took the money and failed to deliver on its end of the bargain."
1876,"Instead of democratising and opening up (economically and politically) the CCP have abused millions upon millions of their own people to try and keep a tight control of power and have burned trust with their former partners and allies (which is why Huawei's 5G infrastructure is being shut out of foreign countries, why there was a trade war, why countries are trying to relocate supply chains elsewhere, why a long list of of companies are trying not to source cotton from Xinjiang, and who knows what else in the future)."
1877,China's system is self-defeating and can only be sustained through constant abuse and oppression of its own people because the CCP have no moral legitimacy and would have to reform if they couldn't force themselves on their people.
1878,"&amp;#x200B;

&gt;This is  exactly why the the West has focus the narrative on ""(market)freedom,  (sham)democracy, and (individual)rights"", and produce atrocity  propagandas

&amp;#x200B;

We talked about misinformation and conspiracy theories earlier, and about people believing them with little to no evidence or understanding of the issues involved."
1879,"I provided you a wealth of evidence that there were atrocities going on in Xinjiang before and you waved it all away with vague, generalised appeals to why we should not trust anything coming from the West (even though many of the critics also come from China), despite having no real proof that the multitude of sources cited were wrong or that their evidence was lacking."
1880,"I invite you to see that you are the conspiracy theorist - you believe that there is no abuse going on in Xinjiang even though you haven't visited Xinjiang to confirm this and the weight of evidence is firmly against your position, because of a generalised distrust of the West based on propoganda and conspiracy theories of Western interference that you credit without hard evidence (which you like to invert by calling this a narrative, propoganda or a Western conspiracy theory)."
1881,"When you are arguing against the evidence and don't have good reasons to justify your own position you are the fool, not anyone else."
1882,"&amp;#x200B;

&gt;To  answer your question, I do not care about ideologies."
1883,I simply look at  results.
1884,"CCP, despites its shortcomings, has served the core interest of  Chinese people incredibly well: sovereignty, stability, peacefulness,  and prosperity, in that order."
1885,"&amp;#x200B;

You do care about ideologies, you very clearly do."
1886,"That is also why you refuse to accept serious criticism of China, it is why you choose to overlook / deny atrocities all over China (Tiananmen, Hong Kong, Xinjiang, the South China Sea) and ignore evidence that contradicts your position."
1887,"The human cost of what has happened to journalists, academics, artists, religious practicioners, free thinkers, lawyers, political rivals / dissidents, ordinary people and ethnic minorities across China is terrible and you should be ashamed for wasting your time unconvincingly trying to pretend it isn't happening and therefore doesn't matter."

1889,noone will ever be safe.
1890,This will eventually be our new flu.
1891,"Therefore, we cannot keep life on pause forever"
1892,&gt; but we're shipping 4M doses from the EU pre-production stockpile your way!
1893,That's a myth btw.
1894,"It was produced in the UK, just fill and finished in the EU, the fill and finish process isn't what is bottlenecking the EU supply."
1895,They are good enough for the under 65 year old age groups.
1896,The Sputnik V vaccine will probably be the first to be approved in the EU.
1897,Why exactly?
1898,"I'm not German but Spanish, but I hope my government would be open to this too."
1899,"If I could choose vaccine I would take Pfizer or Moderna, but since I'm not in a priority group (I'm a professor, but it seems we'll be quite near the back on the queue here) my prospect is probably being offered AZ with its 70% efficacy in late 2021 or early 2022."
1900,"If there were the chance to instead get a Chinese or Russian vaccine in a few months (after the EU institutions check and approve them) and be able to live a somewhat more normal summer, it would be a no-brainer."
1901,What do I care if it's from those countries?
1902,It's not like they were personally designed by Putin or they will make me suddenly recite Mao's red book by heart.
1903,"The data so far seems to point out that their efficacy, while not as good as mRNA vaccines, is at least comparable to AZ."
1904,"If we can get vaccinated earlier by diversifying sources, count me in, and screw Western superiority complex."
1905,Define communism
1906,My sense of taste seemed a little off at first but I realized it was just because my sense of smell was totally gone and those two are really connected.
1907,It’s not like the way you lose your sense of smell or taste with a cold.
1908,That’s usually just congestion and your sinuses being blocked.
1909,The loss of smell and taste because of COVID is actually caused by the virus attacking a certain part of the brain.
1910,That’s why it might or might not come back.
1911,I understand.
1912,I go to work and groceries and that’s it.
1913,The only time I see friends is if I happen to be scheduled to work with them.
1914,My kids have been out of extra curriculars since March and have not returned to school (we’ve been blessed with the option to return or stay remote).
1915,I feel that pain very much.
1916,My point is that I can see benefits to all of the arguments.
1917,"Regardless, I can’t wait until everyone who wants it can get."
1918,"&gt;The  benefit for free exchange of idea if obvious in fields like academia, science, philosophy, i.e."
1919,under controlled environments with rational  people.
1920,But the negative should also be obvious.
1921,"Information spread  publicly have real, widespread consequences on the society and should  not be taken lightly."
1922,"Misinformation, conspiracy theories,  disinformation can all evolve into huge costs for individuals and  societies alike."
1923,"While one could of course hope that the “bad”  information will get debunked by the “good” ones, remember that it cost  way more effort and resources to combat fake news than coming up with  them, and many times the damage is already done way the truth surfaces."
1924,"So for me, the answer is definitely not clear cut and I think a healthy  compromise is the way to go."
1925,"&amp;#x200B;

This is indeed a problem that is being faced by countries around the world, and has recently become a challenge for open, democratic societies in particular."
1926,"There does seem to be a minority in society that are attracted to, and which are susceptible to conspiracy theories, extreme ideologies etc., worse, there are elements that appear to be steadfastly committed to and convinced by these kinds of ideas (i.e."
1927,"with little or no firm evidence they become supremely confident that they now know the truth about the dangers of 5G, vaccines, the motivations of our political and financial elite, the way race relations should be handled etc."
1928,"etc,)."
1929,"In response Western countries are now trying to formulate new demands that they would put on outlets that facilitate or aggressively publish conspiracy theories, misinformation etc."
1930,"(Facebook, Twitter and so forth)."
1931,"&amp;#x200B;

Broadly speaking I believe these efforts have been misguided, just like the Chinese measures we are discussing, but we are in the early days of the process so the solutions offered may improve over time."
1932,"In any case, you cannot reasonably imply that the deliberate spreading of conspiracy theories / misinformation, and a medical professional trying to alert colleagues to a possible healthcare emergency are at all comparable or analogous (in accordance with your own argument this is rational people in a professional environment doing what anyone would expect them to do)."
1933,"I don't know if you meant to make this association but if the measures in place result in this being flagged as a problem then the measures in place represent an unhealthy rather than a healthy compromise, I hope you can come to appreciate."
1934,"In the broadest context, I suppose you would have to reckon with whether the great firewall is a good idea in principle."
1935,"Would you choose to live under it (to never really know the outside world, whether the information you are consuming is real or not, living in a bubble according to your governments designs and prescriptions?)."
1936,"&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Take U.S for example, twitter and FB accounts  get banned all the time for “spreading misinformation”."
1937,"Trump, who  literally represents the voices of almost half of the Americans, is  effectively being shut out of all modern communication platforms."
1938,Anyone  not blind would realize that censorship is alive and well in the U.S  mainstream media.
1939,"Oh not to mention how whistleblowers like Snowden,  Assange, Chelsea Manning, etc gets persecuted for revealing mass  surveillance and war crimes."
1940,"&amp;#x200B;

Straight back to fudged comparisons with the US, every China defender's favourite form of hollow succor."
1941,"In any case I agree with much of this and I absolutely deplore the censorship of the right in American politics (in particular, the frequent painting of the right as being far right, and certain, extreme elements of the far left as being something amenable to decent, moderate society), but this is not an excuse or a justification for China's own censorship - which is on a scale incomparable to that in the US, as you already well know."
1942,"Two rights don't make a wrong, we should condemn both countries here, not one or the other, or fall into letting both off the hook because of whataboutisms."
1943,"&amp;#x200B;

I would contend that whistleblowing is a fairly complex and distinct example of this kind of problem."
1944,"It is hard to draw a line on any issue (what is acceptable, what is not, what are the exceptions or mitigating factors?"
1945,"), doing so at the scale of Snowden or Assange's whistleblowing is even more difficult, though I wish more countries and business could see that whistleblowing is often a public good (as in the case of Snowden), and provide protections for this under the right conditions."
1946,"&amp;#x200B;

&gt;""so  I'd ask the very straightforward question, do you think open,  democratic or closed autocratic governments or political systems tend to  produce better results (or are more likely to achieve a better society)""

&amp;#x200B;

After reading your response I should point out a few things that will weigh heavily on my assessment of the points you have made below."
1947,"First, *you appear to have focussed primarily on economic indicators*, I appreciate that these are important as well, but I am also interested which system produces a better society, i.e."
1948,"a social, legal and political environment that you would choose to live in, and is likely to produce decisions that will continue to make this the case in the future etc."
1949,"I feel like this is not an unusual interpretation when talking to people who defend China because in recent decades Chinese civil society has been hollowed out by attacks on religious practicioners, rival politicians, journalists, human rights advocates, lawyers, free thinkers, artists, influencers, foreigners, minorities etc."
1950,etc.
1951,"(social, cultural, intellectual and artistic gains have lagged behind economic gains over recent decades)."
1952,"Second, *you frequently point to the fact that China has become a lot richer and cite this as a sign that the Chinese government has done something right*, but broadly speaking this is the result of foreign financial investment (Western money and business know how pouring into, and being invested in a relatively under-developed country that had a lot of room to grow and absorb capital)."
1953,"This investment was made on the basis of China's promises to open up its economy on accession to the WTO, which it still has not honoured."
1954,"China would have done well economically whether it was capitalist, socialist, democratic or autocratic if this were the case, so I don't see why this would be an argument in favour of socialism (or evidence of good Chinese governance)."
1955,"Equally, it is China's autocratic tendencies that are now at risk of sabotaging its business deals with the world at large (Australia, India, America, the UK), along with technology theft this is what precipitated the trade war with America and is guiding other countries to try and move manufacturing away from China (in other words, China was enriched because it promised to be less autocratic, now that it is lapsing back into autocracy it risks selling itself short and failing to achieve its potential."
1956,"Admittedly Xi Jinping has already gotten what he wanted out of this relationship, however illicitly, and can now likely snowball China under its own momentum, but that does not really do anything to recommend authoritarianism now does it?"
1957,"):

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;""The  standard of living in China has risen at incredible pace for the past  20-30 years."
1958,"Infrastructure is well-built, economy is now the 2nd  largest in the world, 

&amp;#x200B;

I already answered this above, but infrastructure is well built in Japan as well."
1959,There is a clear correlation between when a countries infrastructure was built and the quality of the infrastructure (the more recent the better typically).
1960,"Any country in China's position, capitalist or socialist, would have enjoyed good infrastructure - see Japan, Dubai etc."
1961,"&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Higher education

&amp;#x200B;

Chinese people in China are achieving high levels of education, although it would be prudent to point out that they are not achieving a well-rounded education (in politics, art, religion, foreign affairs, history etc."
1962,etc.).
1963,"&amp;#x200B;

&gt;The government has pulled over 600 million people  out of extreme poverty \[...\] medicare are at affordable cost."
1964,"&amp;#x200B;

I acknowledge these points, in themselves they are good things, although it should be observed that poverty has all but been eliminated in most advanced countries, capitalist or socialist, and China has shown no real ambition to do anything other than pay lip service to socialism in recent decades (inequality continues to grow, wealth redistribution exists but is not  to the degree that you would expect of a truly socialist or communist country)."
1965,Trying to argue that this is a sign that China is a socialist or communist country is like trying to argue that America owns the moon because it planted the first flag on it.
1966,"Is there any big statistical analysis data on ""catching covid"" and especially how have people caught covid so that we can understand the transmisibility and how dangerous certain activities are???"
1967,For example I think that short range public transport within the city is very safe unless it is overcrowded (shouldnt be when people are home officing).
1968,"M reasoning is that everybody has masks, it is well ventilated space because doors open every 2 minutes at a stop, it is mostly half full, not too crowded, people spend only 15-20 minutes on average there, and you can move within the vehicle if you are concerned somebody is infected."
1969,But how many people actually get sick because they went on a tram and followed save guidelines.
1970,"In my humble but very controversial opinion, people who caught covid either A) didnt follow safe guidelines like masking, distancing, hygiene etc."
1971,"and basically it is their fault and it was preventable or B) they caught covid from a coworker who belongs to A group, which is only partially preventable, because you would have to have a good sealing respirator on all day long or C) who caught it from a housemate who belongs to A group."
1972,"Basically I would like to know how many people caught covid due to not following safe guidelines, and who caught it absolutely silently (like touching an infected surface, or breathing in aerosol that either travelled very far from the source and was in the air for hours and infected someone long after the source left

TL;DR From people who caught covid, what is the ratio of ""douches who didnt respect safety measures"" vs. ""people who didnt do anything wrong but still somehow caugh covid""???"
1973,because in my opinion this pandemic is getting so out of hand because 80-90% are douches who did not prevent catching it...
1974,"&gt;There are many diseases which cause problems in developing countries (like tuberculosis, malaria, ebola, etc.)"
1975,but which have no effect on day-to-day life in developed countries.
1976,Problems which can be solved very easily with infrastructure that is relatively cheap.
1977,Is that really something we are okay letting it continue to happen?
1978,"So, they got it from the mother, despite them all wearing surgical masks."
1979,I don't think this is new information.
1980,Plenty of studies/real world examples show that Covid spreads inside despite mask wearing and social distancing.
1981,Being inside with others can be deadly.
1982,Stay away from each other.
1983,Yeah good to see the UK doing something well.
1984,"And Britain did that at risk before they even knew the vaccine worked,  enabling production to start way earlier than normal"
1985,It's much more difficult because of supply bottlenecks.
1986,As an Australian living in Melbourne the lockdowns or at least restrictions worked.
1987,It sucked but it worked.
1988,All good.
1989,It happens to the best of us :) Hope you're having a nice day!
1990,Good to know.
1991,I was considering drinking a bit before I got the vaccine.
1992,I have PTSD from other people touching me and alcohol helps relax me enough to get through most situations.
1993,Didn’t buy Chinese vaccines.
1994,We were going to trial one of theirs for data but we never ended up getting it.
1995,No.
1996,Excuse deaths can lag 3-4 weeks.
1997,And the vaccine is only that effective after 6 weeks.
1998,That's about the first thing you've said that we can both agree on.
1999,"Dude I live in la lol, I know the weather."
2000,It'll stay chilly foruch longer stretches than florida.
2001,Also I lived in florida for 20 years so I think I know what I'm talking about.
2002,\-The delays in Europe are due to the incompetence of EU politicians who could have signed a deal for vaccines in Europe in May 2020 but then delayed until August to haggle over an already dirt cheap vaccine.
2003,They are now experiencing manufacturing difficulties which they would have gone through three months ago.
2004,"(which britain went through three months ago)

\-So the EU has decided to throw its toys out the pram and block exports of vaccines which will deprive Australia and other countries of the vaccines they would receive which are produced in the EU."

2025,I'm from Surrey/South London so anything past Finchley gives me a nosebleed.
2026,If vaccine administration ramps up I (22 years old) think I can get vaccinated before Summer.
2027,"If we're doing 40 million doses a month (which is on the low end I think, could get 50+ million per month even) February/March/April/May, that's 160 million doses in addition to the 30 million we've already administered."
2028,I think could get into that group.
2029,"By then availability will be quite broad I'd imagine, and I don't think they'll be super strict on age."
2030,"Not OP, but if they have more vaccines than they can dish out in any particular day, they offer it to other people to use them up rather than wasting them."
2031,Congrats!!!
2032,Oh man I wish we had this in the US!
2033,"&gt;That's nice, and what does that have to do with my point?"
2034,"Are you suggesting that vaccines should go to ""natives"" first because ""white"" people can't be poor and can't have bad healthcare?"
2035,"No, that's not what I'm saying."
2036,"People like to talk about the past as if it has no effect on the present, as you are right now."
2037,"There are other factors that have made the pandemic worse for native people and other minority groups in america, besides poverty."
2038,"The most obvious problem is the modern day poverty caused by our history of racism, but racism is causing other issues as well

And for the record, i'm not anti poor white people."
2039,Poverty sucks even without experiencing racism.
2040,"That's why I think we should enact policies that help all people, such as healthcare for everyone

2061,Similar deals are also signed with American companies.

2091,"Brazil never had an actual lockdown, and we surely aren't in a lockdown now."
2092,I believe that's one of the things the Biden administration is looking on doing.
2093,Moderna actually asked the FDA to approve up to five additional doses in each of its vaccine vials.
2094,That would increase available doses by 50%.
2095,Lol your from rSino.
2096,Thank you china for spreading this pandemic.
2097,And Im sitting here in good old Germany where they fucked everything up and people are going to be waiting month to get a vaccine.
2098,"I did some research on a site and it suggested that if we continue to vaccine people this fast, then I'll be able to get one in November 2023. smfh."
2099,Lol it rarely gets below a high of 60 ever in LA
2100,And a bucket of vindaloo?
2101,China can build a 200 bed hospital in 5 days!
2102,How is that?
2103,It's not just elderly people who are vulnerable though.
2104,"There are plenty of working aged adults who are immunocompromised, either through illness, medication or both."
2105,Some of those can't work and are able to quarantine but now have no life because they cannot risk going anywhere or they don't have any choice and have to take the risk of going to work every single day.
2106,Lots of retired people also have a life outside of sitting in the house all day every day and likely have far more money to spend than college kids do.
2107,Take it from me.
2108,Quarantining for months on end isn't very fun.
2109,"I've been in the house almost all day, every single day since last March because I'm one of those vulnerable working age adults."
2110,More free to drive safely knowing the dickheads r getting fines
2111,"Early state updates suggest today is going to be a really low day for new cases in the us, compared with recent months"

2119,"&gt;Pfizer alone said they'd be able to provide 200m doses by the end of May, two months earlier than initially expected."
2120,They’ve just started counting each vial as 6 doses instead of 5.
2121,We aren’t actually getting anything any faster than originally planned.
2122,A hundred miles or so south of California.
2123,Right next to the island of Alaska.

2127,Maybe two dozen locally acquired cases in January across the whole of Australia.
2128,How's your country doing?
2129,"Also, having active land borders and high travel didn't stop Vietnam and Thailand from swiftly handling COVID!"
2130,"Probably but between vaccinations, herd immunity, increased awareness, and the possibility of mutating to a less-dangerous disease it probably won't be a serious issue every year."
2131,Was about to call you a stupid American but you’re Canadian.
2132,What a joke.
2133,Its gone BONKERS here.
2134,Everyone made a mad dash for the shops - like within 10 minutes of the announcement it was standing room only.
2135,"Good way to increase the spread, for sure."
2136,Not.
2137,Yet.
2138,So your happy with the shithouse quarentine system?
2139,When we have an army and air force fully equiped to deal with biological warfare and move tens of thousands at a moment notice for some reason cannot get australians home and isolate them them in isolated areas
2140,why are you comparing us to other countries who have handled the virus worse than us?
2141,let's compare it to other countries like taiwan who didn't resort to travel exit bans and have allowed people to quarantine at home.
2142,"their economy is doing way better than ours too, but if we want to talk about economy versus lives saved, well prioritising tennis stars over stranded australians is already choosing the economy over aussie lives unless they don't count because they're not in australia?"

2155,So long as you don't know them then who gives a fuck aye?
2156,A slight inconvenience to you so who gives a fuck about anyone else.
2157,You’re exactly right.
2158,I’ve been working all year as an “essential worker”.
2159,... guess what I do?
2160,Deliver food to people!
2161,But somehow my minimum wage job is more essential than Mrs.
2162,"Teacher making 80,000+ a year?!?!"
2163,I call bs!
2164,"I don’t work for a union, that’s the difference."
2165,Unions should be banned from public employment.
2166,Never again should government workers be able to hold the tax payers hostage.
2167,"Meanwhile, also exploiting parents (their paycheck payers) as slobs."
2168,I’m fed up.
2169,"Thats true, but as far as I am aware, its still a single strand vaccine?"
2170,I mean.
2171,The mRNA being used Now is the S protein one.
2172,"And as I am aware (maybe I am mistaken), but there arent strands with different S proteins."
2173,We just have a more community minded approach to freedom as opposed to individual freedoms.
2174,"We are still supposed to wear masks in Victoria where we had Australia's worst outbreak, but for the most part life is normal again."
2175,Sacrifice is worth the risk sometimes mate
2176,They should have chased them away with vaccines while screaming Bill Gates is going to put this chip in you!
2177,"There is only like 40 prisoners in Gitmo, considering we are vaccinating over a million people a day for you really think its going to make a huge difference?"
2178,"People are less inclined to do big meet ups where i am, we wear masks on public transport and shopping,  you're looked down on for not doing so in my area at least (Sydney, Northern beaches) we were locked down for 2 weeks over the christmas/new year period which sucked balls but was necessary for the greater good,  so now my kids can meet up to go fishing or surfing with a few mates so it was worth it in my books."

2180,"The point is that in that case it wouldn't be lung damage specific to covid, but pneumonia, making the headline a bit of a clickbait."
2181,It would depend on the state.
2182,I'm in NSW.
2183,"The current recommendation (not rule) is mask on public transport, in confined areas like classrooms of you can't separate, and required in some hospital/medical settings."
2184,"Can go to pubs and the like, just got to leave contact details with a qr check in."
2185,Got an email saying restrictions are easing but haven't read it yet.
2186,"All this means if there is a case, the number of people exposed in the 3-4 day between being infectious and being identified is minimised."
2187,But it's not a lock down.
2188,??
2189,Hospitalizations have jumped off a cliff in almost every state

2192,I read this in Hunter S Thompson's voice if he were alive today!
2193,Hahhahhahahha.
2194,You really think anything that has been done have been 'extreme measures'?
2195,Really?
2196,Extreme measures would be rounding up anyone that tested positive and putting them in detention.
2197,That would be extreme.
2198,"Being paid to stay at home, that is almost nothing."
2199,"Reading accounts from overseas is horrifying, isn't it."
2200,Especially when reading about the effect it's having on kids.
2201,So glad my kids are free to have a normal childhood.
2202,Yes we are.
2203,Like I said.
2204,"You can leave and reenter, but it's harder than it was (need an exemption to leave and to quarantine on return.)"
2205,"It's not impossible, just more difficult."
2206,[removed]
2207,Same.
2208,I took my daughter to see the Frozen musical in the middle of Sydney today.
2209,"Theatre was packed full of kids and parents, everyone had a great time, lots of laughter."
2210,We went to a restaurant beforehand.
2211,My “inconvenience” was having to wear a mask in the theatre and also registering my contact details at the restaurant and also upon entering the theatre.
2212,"Kids go to school tomorrow, they’re very happy to interact with their teachers and friends like normal."
2213,"I can’t go on campus, it’s a small price to pay to keep the community safe."
2214,It’s such a draconian country and my freedoms are threatened /s.
2215,&gt;whole country that shut down but their citizens don't require a travel exemption to leave and they have far better case numbers than we do.
2216,"I think corona did lead to an increase in rolling around wether it be roller skates, skateboards or bicycles"
2217,"God thankyou, this whole argument of ""but they can stop travelling"" is tiresome... any place can stop travel if the people are willing."
2218,"We are not a tiny island of 500 people, people travel for work, food trucks run night and day from state to state.. but it is minimum movement with only necessary reasons."
2219,That’s because we (collectively) take this shit seriously.
2220,&gt;they don't require their citizens to have travel exemptions and they are taking in a higher number of their citizens back from overseas.
2221,that's the reality.
2222,are you calling me a liar?
2223,prove it so.
2224,I’m so sorry you are going through this.
2225,You are completely right.
2226,"People repeat rhetoric, and it doesn’t matter how many facts and rationales or even personal stories you have, they just keep repeating the same dogma."
2227,It feels like the country is in a state of collective psychosis.
2228,And the gaslighting given to parents right now is pretty extreme.
2229,"“Your kid isn’t suicidal from loneliness and hopelessness, you are just a bad parent!"
2230,"Why didn’t you go on more family walks!” 

My best friend is a teacher and has 4 kids - 3 are school age."
2231,"One had a mental breakdown a few months ago and is now on 2 psych meds (she’s 12), 1 kid has disabilities and has been completely failed with her IEP ignored, and 1 is now so far behind academically she needs an IEP."
2232,"She says her kids need to be in school and she will of course go back too, but her own coworkers are failing her."
2233,I’be always been a very complacent public school supporter but they lost all of my faith this year.
2234,"All the other essential workers stepped up, and teachers just left society down."
2235,Full stop.
2236,If only it was that easy..
2237,"I'll give an example: on the Sweden-Finland border, half the nurses on the Swedish side commute from Finland."
2238,Sweden's epidemic started growing last year.
2239,What do you do?
2240,"Close the hospital, because the epidemic is so bad?"
2241,"Arrest the nurses in Sweden (although there is no law for that), tell their kids the parent won't be picking them up from daycare?"
2242,"I'm not saying it shouldn't be done, I'm saying it's not easy."
2243,&gt; Spoken like someone from T_D.

2247,"That's what happens when woke media, politicians, and academics have spent the past half a decade scaring black people into thinking that vaccines are still being used to experiment on and sterilize them."
2248,People in the comments talking about how he was obese.
2249,"Wrong We arent allowed to leave without government permission

And you arent allowed to enter without paying thousands and spending 2 weeks in hotel quarentine"
2250,Not really.
2251,It's pretty normal here.
2252,People social distance and get tested for the slightest of symptoms and if there is an outbreak (which is usually if the virus has escaped hotel quantine) then that area goes into mini lock down until all contact tracing has been done and the virus brought under control.
2253,"We are pretty good here following the rules, as we know it's for the greater good for all."
2254,"i really can't unless i get approved for a travel exemption, and reuniting with a partner or ailing parents or your own children are not considered a compelling reason enough to be granted approval to leave."
2255,Watching those crowds at the tennis exhibitions and what will soon be the Australian open is amazing.

2260,"Fuck, I need to move to nz or au"
2261,"Apparently he caught it from his neigh-bour, but the antivirals are canter-acting the virus and he’s in stable condition."
2262,No we are not
2263,Protesting what?
2264,California had stricter lockdowns than any other state and its an absolute disaster.
2265,"Maybe ""lockdowns don't work"" is too extreme but it's very obvious that lock downs alone aren't the solution."
2266,2.5 million.

2275,Realizing this is the key to staying sane on this cesspit.
2276,We are now allowed up to 30 people in your house.
2277,Masks are expected and used on public transport and shops - although it’s not enforced.
2278,Everyone does it though.
2279,At least where I live.
2280,You don’t need a mask in Eg a pub.
2281,But everytime you enter somewhere you scan in to say you’ve been there
2282,If they paid millions to hospitals providing money that is saving thousands of lives then yeah they probably do deserve the shot.
2283,Spoken like someone from T_D.
2284,You read my anecdote added?
2285,Of course we should be overjoyed about this system.
2286,"I drove someone who was dying to an ER in a further away place because the hospital nearby is terrible, would probably let him die and send the bill, and he would never be able to afford an ambulance bill on top of all that because he wasn't insured."
2287,So I drove him to the further of two hospitals in the area because of those considerations.
2288,"Because first world healthcare is hard to find in our first world country, although it exists."
2289,And this is without vaccines that can be easily transported and administered.
2290,"No kidding, that was quick!"
2291,"For anyone that hasn't seen the news:

2292,"Seriously, just put a hold on commuting between borders until people stop dying by the boatload."
2293,I honestly wonder if people during WW2 complained about turning the lights off at night to mitigate against bombing raids.
2294,peoples willingness to be herded like this is also scary
2295,What?
2296,"People travel interstate in Australia constantly, and the majority of our cases have come from international travelers, AFAIK."
2297,Stop trying to make excuses for the total failure of US government policy.

2353,Let others make their own choices about masks....
2354,"&gt;Experts say several factors could be driving the emerging disparity, including deep distrust of the medical establishment among Black Americans because of a history of discriminatory treatment; inadequate access to the vaccine in Black neighborhoods; and a digital divide that can make it difficult to get crucial information."

2444,Vaccines are only helpful if people actually have them.
2445,"Maybe a hot take, but dare I say, if the vaccine is not available to anyone who wants one, you don’t get to say “we can’t stop the virus even though we have vaccines, we may as well give up.”

Particularly if you have a timeline for when you expect to actually have enough vaccines for anyone who wants one to get one."
2446,Impossible.
2447,US is only getting 10M vaccine doses a week for the next 3 months.
2448,There’s a supply constraint unfortunately.
2449,This.
2450,You're not a medical professional to state whether showering or not works.

2452,That's just semantics.
2453,It is an effective export ban no matter what you call it.

2455,We'll all have surplus vaccines to give away in 6 or 9 months time.
2456,Waw!
2457,That is huge cultural difference between our old people!
2458,Here vaccination in the 80+ has got a 98% acceptance rate.
2459,Our old people remember the times before the vaccines where polio and TB were everywhere.
2460,So they're very pro vaccine.

2492,Yeah we've been told that UK's sovereignity is not important and the EU is some glorious organisation just for that to be immediately proven otherwise in the first month after leaving.
2493,Not even 30 days and we're already seeing the objective benefits that come from the risk of being independent.

2495,"&gt; The PCR tests are extremely sensitive, so they would pick up virus particles in your nose even if they are not enough to infect you."

2510,"There’s also group 6, which is under 65s with conditions like diabetes."
2511,My local hospital has started vaccinating groups 5 and 6 as of last Friday.
2512,No quote there.
2513,But I can explain it.
2514,It is the only vaccine production facility in the Netherlands that has made a contract to manufacture AZ vaccines.
2515,"This is a production facility for the actual vaccine, bottling is done in Germany."
2516,These plants should also be used for the EU order.
2517,But still don't believe me?
2518,"Here is an UK article that explains the Dutch plant is for production, and the German plant is for bottling."
2519,"And the Dutch plant is named:

&gt; Firstly, the production of the vaccine fluid itself which happens at three sites: Oxford Biomedica in Oxfordshire, Cobra Biologics in Staffordshire and the Halix factory in the Netherlands."
2520,"[https://metro.co.uk/2021/01/05/how-is-the-oxford-astrazeneca-vaccine-made-13848511/](https://metro.co.uk/2021/01/05/how-is-the-oxford-astrazeneca-vaccine-made-13848511/)

2522,"TBF, state censorship is a thing."
2523,Thanks that's very amazing.
2524,No they aren’t.
2525,US will only be getting 1.5M doses of vaccine a day from here on out.
2526,It’s impossible for US to give 3M doses.
2527,"It’s a supply constraint from here on out, no longer a distribution or administration problem."
2528,"If the EU was pissed, the UK would receive 0 further doses (exactly none of those were produced in the UK, all made in germany/switzerland/elsewhere)."
2529,Guess EU is not pissed.
2530,"Meanwhile in France, today, a total of 24 people, all of them over 90 years of age, were offered a dose of the covid-19vaccine."
2531,17 of which declined the offer citing worries about the long term effects of said vaccine.
2532,"No, but 50% increased transmissibility makes a surge more likely."
2533,"You know they’ve actually published the contract and this has been completely dispelled, right?"
2534,Pause the thing that can end this and the speed of which will determine when life can go back to normal?
2535,"Yeah no, whoever this official is he needs to shut the fuck up"
2536,Yes definitely.
2537,"The reason Novavax were able to reduce the number of people in the trial was because they were so confident in the early data, and statistical significance has proved them right."
2538,"Novavax should be approved in Canada soon, and they should make it a priority because it’s a much more effective vaccine than Oxford/AZ and they should get it sooner"
2539,"They’re not diverted, technically."
2540,"We’re just not getting any for a week and then like 20% for 2 weeks, while other countries are getting smaller reductions or no reductions at all."
2541,So it’s basically what it amounts to.
2542,But if the contract is quarterly then there’s no breach possible until end of March.
2543,"It just sucks because every day that passes 1 infection becomes 2 which becomes 3 which becomes 5, etc."
2544,6-12 weeks per Dr. Osterholm.
2545,Yeah the stick itself isn’t where the bottleneck is.
2546,It’s all the logistics plus the observation period

2554,Then I guess it will just be a case of working down all the age groups.
2555,"Yeah, that strain has really only gone completely out of control in the UK, and It’s been detected all over the world at this point."
2556,AstraZeneca oversold massively.
2557,The vaccine was due for approval in December.
2558,"If there hadn't been the problems with the AZ trials in the US and the delayed request for approval in the EU, AZ would have to supply hundreds of millions of doses to the US, the UK, the EU and others by now for vaccines that were paid months ago."
2559,What would that shortfall be like?
2560,90%?
2561,Do you know who Michael Osterholm is?
2562,He was a COVID advisor to the Biden administration.
2563,He’s not some crank.

2565,LOL when I speak to my grandparents that's exactly what they say.
2566,Actually no they say the opposite.
2567,But they don't actually thank me for staying home and saving their lives because they're not assholes.
2568,Mostly we talk about how its been hard for both them and me.
2569,realistically community transmission will plummet before a big chunk of phase 2 get their shots.

2585,That's not where saliva comes from...
2586,"Our numbers are great for sure, but we're adopting a ""delay the second dose so people get the first dose faster"" strategy which international medical opinion seems to be opposed to."
2587,I'd like to be positive right now but I think we need to see how that plays out before calling this an indisputable success.
2588,Yeah I'm sure that's real reassuring to the 100k who are dead because of the Government's incompetence 🙄
2589,The reason we look so far behind the rest is that our government has decided to do all care home and seriously at risk older folk first.
2590,Think we've pretty much finished care homes while rest of UK is much less than that.
2591,Don't know if it's a better approach but just pointing it out!
2592,Of course I don’t want to.
2593,"it either indicates that it's already dominant or close to dominant and simply not as transmissible as the early reports said, or that it's not as transmissible as people thought and therefore won't become dominant."
2594,"either way if this has been in the US for over two and a half months, it basically blows a giant hole in Osterholm's theory that the worst of the pandemic is yet to come"
2595,It's fine.
2596,I'm not bothered.
2597,Retrospective data collection looking for patterns and common effects is one of the fastest ways to a Ph.D these days.
2598,The true geniuses are pushing forward with an idea.
2599,"The ""slightly less than genius"" are going back over the information we already have, trying to find what we missed, and make our science better."
2600,Our Prime Minister is incompetent
2601,We are around 3 months in front of you with the rollout.
2602,I hope we'll be able to divert some vaccine over to Europe at some point in the spring and then actually do it.
2603,"At the very least I want our government to be telling everyone else how to roll out the vaccine quickly and effectively, at this point it's going quite smoothly and I'm sure a few pointers on what works and doesn't would be welcome."

2640,"Aye, I was not smart on making my comment."
2641,I’ll leave it up tho.
2642,First of all closing borders would not be a win for anyone in Europe.
2643,"Second of all in order for that to work we're talking *literally* no-one and nothing in, so maybe slightly possible when talking continents instead of countries."
2644,"""Limited number of countries"" lmao more like the majority of countries on the planet."
2645,Third every single country/continent you'd open the borders with would have to be completely vaccinated and have these imaginary perfectly sealed borders with everyone else too.
2646,And lastly even in that fantasy bubble there would still be a pandemic going on outside that bubble and humans would be dying.
2647,Another person who thinks viruses decay like radiation.
2648,They don’t.
2649,"Viruses evolve to become more infectious, if they can spread more, but become more lethal, they will."

2652,"We also used to shit in holes in the ground, piss in the same river we drank from and thought illness was demonic in nature."
2653,Although I must admit some crazy people still believe in magic miracles and an invisible all-knowing (past/present/and future) being and somehow still think they have free will in that scenario.
2654,"We used to stone people for not saying the ""right"" thing or believing the ""wrong"" thing or refusing to go along with mass delusions."
2655,Just because some shitty things happened in the past doesn't mean we as a species have to continue to do them.
2656,"Schools should reopen, my nephews school district has been opened since lockdowns ended in May, kids seem happy and we didnt have this massive surge of cases many predicted would happen."
2657,Without holding in person classes kids are losing on quality education and social growth that is needed in the early years of life.
2658, it is also so unrealistic to shut down airports everywhere.
2659,"Also, covid is everywhere now so air travel is less of a threat than community transmission"
2660,"My mother in law's nursing home had an outbreak of covid start last week, just three days before all staff and residents were due to get the vaccine."

2675,&gt; People in Australia still need to wear masks.
2676,They've continued to have to have rolling lockdowns as cases pop up.
2677,That's not even remotely close to our situation here.
2678,The last lockdown we had affected a few thousand people in one tiny corner of Sydney from the week before Christmas and New Year's Day for the southern part of the locked down region and about 9 days of January for the northern part.
2679,I was stuck in the south and there went my Christmas vacation.
2680,Before that?
2681,South Australia had one for three days and prior to that it'd been months before any state had one of note.
2682,Most of the rest of the country?
2683,Freely open and disease free for months.
2684,We just finished having a period of compulsory masks in all public areas for a few weeks in NSW which really isn't a big imposition anyway.
2685,TL;DR - most of the country's been back to normal for many months and the rest of the country has been mostly normal and not greatly inconvenienced over that time either.
2686,Full sporting arenas with no-one catching Covid-19 (because it's not in the community anymore for now - actually we've had 2 weeks of no detected cases anywhere in the country).
2687,New Zealand's been even better off and they've been fully open domestically for long stretches of months at a time.
2688,They'll deal with their current situation very quickly.
2689,"Anyway, now multiple vaccines are here after less than a year and after the population's vaccinated over the next one, we'll reassess the situation."
2690,So we may just have had to been majorly inconvenienced for a couple of years in the end if even that.
2691,r/unexpectedmulaney
2692,I've been in an ambulance a couple times.
2693,"They never choose, they always asked me which hospital I wanted to go to."
2694,This is where dates and numbers come into play.
2695,Funding your own production at the 11th hour for the smallest price possible gets you where the EU is with AZ.
2696,Funding well over the odds (so there's spare money for manufacturing expansion) 5 months before the vaccine is approved gets you where the UK is.
2697,"As I already agreed, funding production isn't the same as funding R&amp;D, but it is better than funding neither (or funding it so late and so minimally that it can't help in time)."
2698,"Again, for sources please look at the many articles from mid/late last year panning the UK for ""wasting"" so much money on vaccines, and the EU's self promoted pride in ""getting a good price"" (which quite obviously means less money for the companies to use for scaling up)."
2699,"Let’s give it a shot, we tried everything else🤦🏼"
2700,Don't confuse ending the pandemic with ending the disease.
2701,"Bringing down cases and having fewer outbreaks is what will help with long COVID, that's what vaccines are for."
2702,Yes they will.
2703,They are already bringing long covid in kids into discussions despite there being little to no evidence of this.
2704,Not negative.
2705,I’m doing some math.
2706,The original poster said we should be done by Q3 and I’m pointing out that we have hundreds of days which takes us to Q3.
2707,No it is not.
2708,"One version of the virus is a bit better at resisting vaccines, but still below the numbers that was presented for how good the vaccine needed to be to stop the virus."
2709,It has not learned to resist the vaccine because this version started in places that has not been vaccinated.
2710,Stop scaremongering for clicks.
2711,I get ya man.
2712,Here’s what you need to know.
2713,Every.
2714,pandemic.
2715,Ends.
2716,Whether that’s vaccines.
2717,Herd immunity or anything in between they end.
2718,Humanity’s natural state of existing is without a pandemic raging.

2720,The amount of those spent during an outbreak is probably under like 60-70.

2747,I don’t think they were assuming you had it.
2748,"More than likely, they were giving you some extra space out of respect for your relative comfort level."
2749,"If you’re in the minority wearing a mask, that indicates to them that you’re less comfortable with the risk of getting infected and want to be following social distancing protocols, so they give you as much space as they can."
2750,"Compared to others, who could have worn masks if they had wanted to."
2751,Why give those people the extra space when they aren’t bothering with the simple precaution of wearing a mask?
2752,Thank you for the kind words :) Hope you're having a nice weekend!

2766,"I'm going to assume you're in the US, but in some countries, social distancing is not as exclusive because COVID is much more controlled."
2767,"Countries that have performed much better than the US recognized that people shouldn't be asked to forego socialization for 4+ months and maintained the value of social pods or bubbles, which really should have been pushed here in the US."
2768,"I think the idea of having a ""pandemic buddy"" would have caught on here but  Americans would rather have massive parties or not leave their house at all for a year, there's just no room for nuanced management."

2786,This was long before covid.

2810,And every person with any sort of sickness by start of July.
2811,The government has already said that this is when they see us being able to go back to a pretty normal life.

2830,You make an appointment with your barber and they will take care of it.
2831,They are a highly reputable company
2832,It's not like you get to 70-80% and then people decide normality is back.
2833,Its a gradual process that'll happen as you approach that number cases will drop as well hospitalizations and deaths
2834,"We’re already seeing a drop in the U.S, however, Fauci said that’s not even cause of vaccines yet."
2835,Which is good news.
2836,"We’re already dropping regardless of the vaccine, the vaccine will just deal a final blow."
2837,This happens sometimes with vaccines.
2838,It's just your immune system recognizing a threat an reacting.

2868,Well longer than 12 months but if you go by the date that the WHO issues a global health emergency then yeah it was 31st.
2869,It’s quite he stretch to say “both your lives were put at risk”.
2870,"You were probably all wearing masks, and the nurses were likely wearing N95s."
2871,"Even if they did happen to be infected and asymptomatic or presymptomatic, the contagion was mostly contained by their masks and you were offered some protection by yours."
2872,Us healthcare workers have been seeing patients safely through this whole ordeal without a vaccine.
2873,Every visit to the hospital is “putting your life at risk” if this is your standard for it.
2874,You could catch an antibiotic resistant staph infection sitting on an exam table.
2875,Or having your blood drawn.
2876,But the risk of those is highly unlikely because medical professionals tend to take the proper precautions to prevent them.
2877,This makes no sense?
2878,Vaccine protects you from the virus but it still doesn’t stop you from transmitting it if you get it.
2879,And this has what to do with the vaccine?
2880,92 people in 26 outbreaks really isn't that many.
2881,Is this supposed to make people scared of the schools reopening or something?

2887,There is no reason to think it's gone permanently.
2888,"Wait til the mutated variety gains traction, not pessimistict it's just I'm home all day everyday researching everything that's occurring and discovering the reasons behind why those events transpired that way that they did."
2889,"And from what I've seen is that each continent is developing it's own different version of a mutated variant, and the vaccine we currently have was developed to provide immunization for an earlier less mutated strain."
2890,"And there are cases on the rise of people getting either one or both vaccines and shortly after passing away and we're left with ""currently investigating""

I'll leave y'all with this, raise your PH with certain foods and drinks, dunno off the top of my head... so look it up"
2891,[removed]
2892,Your post is full of criticism of doubt and other emotional terminology.
2893,"The reason scientists have doubts is because coronaviruses are highly able to mutate and evade immunity, either natural or vaccine induced."
2894,Part of the reason the west has done so badly is because of a knee-jerk reaction against any possible negative news.
2895,"Optimism is great, but not when it’s just a way of ignoring possibilities you don’t like."
2896," When Chicago enters Phase Four, the following regulations will be in place:  

* Indoor dining and indoor events will remain limited to the lesser of 25% capacity or 25 people per space 
* Most other industries will be limited to the lesser of 40% capacity or 50 people 
*  Bar seating will be allowed and indoor table size can increase to 6 people 
*  Non-essential business curfew will be repealed
* Bars and restaurants will be able to extend operating hours to midnight, with no alcohol service after 11pm

2901,Full indoor dining should be back in many states even prior to that.

3056,DeSantis had to be sued to release the reports on CoVID19.
3057,DeSantis attacked a data scientist reporting the FL data.
3058,"DeSantis alluded to there being people testing positive that never tested, and there being a ton of people being counted as deaths when they died in car accidents (both proved false)."
3059,DeSantis revamped the positivity rate to have multiple negative tests count for negatives but only the first positive count for positives.
3060,"DeSantis mis-construes the daily deaths by making it seem like they all happened in the past, when we well know that the worst of the daily deaths are just coming to roost now."
3061,The guy fudges everything.
3062,So their strategy is just to let the disease spread and have people die if they are going to die?

3081,The district in Wisconsin my mom teaches out sends emails about every new positive case to all staff and parents.
3082,&gt; It’s hard when there are continual posts on Reddit that rave about how amazing wfh is and how no one should go back to office ever again.
3083,"&gt; It’s like some on here don’t want this pandemic to end, just because they don’t like talking to other people."
3084,I honestly think those people are a minority.
3085,"Let me offer a little reality check as someone who's been fortunate enough to work from home since March, while also following fairly strict restrictions to avoid catching COVID, meaning I limit myself to outdoor dog walks, grocery stores, and a few other essential errands when they are absolutely needed."
3086,I've done zero restaurants/takeout/fast food since March.
3087,"I love working from home, think it's great, and would love to continue doing it after the pandemic is under control/over."
3088,"I get to spend time with my dog, I don't have to choose between 2 hours of commuting a day or 40 minutes of commuting a day with a $15/day parking pass, and eating at home is certainly less expensive."
3089,What would make it better is being able to be more social once the work day is over.
3090,"I would love to get back to meeting up with friends/family for happy hour before heading to an NBA game, or getting together for extended family birthday/holiday celebrations."
3091,"Since March, I've seen my dad once in person, seen my brother once in person, and seen no other friends and family in person."
3092,That sucks and I can't wait for it to change.
3093,"I miss going to the movie theater, my body misses having access to a gym, and I would like to be able to go to other events again (concerts, etc)."

3095,"I've worked at the same hospital &amp; research institution off and on for 17 years, so I have many connections there."
3096,It's nice to attend a weekly research conference in person or visit the on-campus cafeterias because of the chance encounters with old friends and colleagues that you may not cross paths with virtually.
3097,"Ideally, I would like to work from home with the option to be in the office, say with reservable desk space."
3098,Have an important meeting you would like to have in person or want to attend that research conference in person?
3099,Reserve a desk/kiosk for that day.
3100,"Most importantly, I want to avoid returning to the daily grind of commuting to a cubicle only to have no meetings/nothing important to do in-person once I'm there."
3101,"Yes, an occasional water cooler conversation can be nice, but not at the expense of 2 hours of my day on public transit."
3102,"tl;dr: For those of us that like working from home but miss pre-pandemic freedoms/aren't hermits, I think there's a happy medium to be had in between going back to office commuting and mimicking a quarantine WFH bubble after the pandemic is under control."

3330,The governments of Europe and the US were not able to use non pharmaceutical interventions effectively for various reasons - for example police chiefs in most of the US are elected by local voters so it's impossible for the Governor or the President to boss them around and get them to enforce a lockdown effectively.
3331,We're also not Japan where local people are compliant enough voluntarily that the pandemic wasn't *too* bad there.
3332,But we're absolutely destroying COVID with our pharmaceutical industry.

3355,For a disease everyone says that kids aren't affected by.
3356,"These are likely very preventable deaths too, but kids (and teachers, school staff and all families) were put at risk because of politicizing of masks, dissention of general recommended public hygiene protocols, and complete lack of government leadership, with no funding for schools to open properly."
3357,"Americans have an incessant urge to splice every conceivable dataset by race, and then publish the results in the absence of known cause or context, leaving the public to draw its own, often nefarious, conclusions."
3358,"This habit is a recipe for disunity, bitterness, and resentment."
3359,It gives the illusion of victimisation whether it actually exists or not; it manufactures purpose and intent.

3364,But is it meaningful beyond the vagaries of happenstance in something as stochastic and clumpy as disease propagation?
3365,Of course people list a litany of putative causes.
3366,Some are innocuous (eg Hispanics have bigger family gatherings); others are divisive (eg prejudiced doctors make less effort to help them).
3367,But nobody estimates the proportion of the variance that is explained by each cause.
3368,Maybe the innocuous causes explain 99% of the variance?
3369,"In the absence of estimates of causal effects, the public is left to grasp whatever personal axe they have to grind."
3370,We are left with a less happy and less united citizenry.

3382,Hang in there - the end is in sight (vaccines)!
3383,If they haven't been in contact for 16 days there's something like a .03% chance they caught it and haven't shown symptoms yet.
3384,Well over 99% of infected individuals show symptoms within 12.5 days.
3385,The people they ate with probably caught covid later by a week or ten days and are now sick.
3386,Why would the EU skip Biontech/Pfizer?
3387,"So far, it's the best vaccine and the EU has the biggest order of 600 million doses."
3388,"If Biontech can enter into other partnership to produce even more, I would rather skip all other vaccines."
3389,"In my area, 73% of deaths come from Long Term Care Homes and assisted living and they make up way less than 1% of the population."
3390,With a targeted vaccination program you should be a huge decrease in deaths soon.
3391,"From my PHO: 

* 2 weeks after the first dose the vaccine effectiveness was 92.6% Pfizer and 92.1% Moderna
   * Short term protection is achieved rapidly and is very high
   * Easy\_Beg."
3392,Note: Those numbers are for general population.
3393,"Older people would probably have a little lower efficacy 

So two weeks after the 1st dose you should see a rapid decrease in LTCH residents getting covid-19."
3394,A couple weeks after that you should see a drastic decrease in deaths.
3395,LTCH residents generally aren't hospitalized so you shouldn't see much change in those numbers until large groups of elders are vaccinated.

3451,"[Quoting the New York Times'  on some of the research](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/12/health/coronavirus-immunity-future.html):

&gt;The virus is a grim menace now because it is an unfamiliar pathogen that can overwhelm the adult immune system, which has not been trained to fight it."
3452,That will no longer be the case once everyone has been exposed to either the virus or vaccine.
3453,"&gt;  
&gt;Children, on the other hand, are constantly challenged by pathogens that are new to their bodies, and that is one reason they are more adept than adults at fending off the coronavirus."
3454,"Eventually, the study suggests, the virus will be of concern only in children younger than 5, subjecting even them to mere sniffles — or no symptoms at all."

3671,"There were parts of the US where it was too late to stop the first wave, such as New York, Boston, Detroit, most of the Pacific Coast."
3672,"But they could have saved so much of the US with internal border controls, which Australia still has and which NZ has also used during the second wave in Auckland."
3673,"There is an argument that for the US the Constitution prevented this, but in fact the Supreme Court precedent from 1900 did not declare state border closures unconstitutional and there was room for states to at least try to close their borders."
3674,"NZ's lockdown was actually ruled illegal by the NZ courts, but the govt did it anyway and then passed a retroactive law making it legal, and for the future."
3675,The failure of 49 out of 50 US governors to even attempt to manage their borders shows the lack of political courage.
3676,"And closing the border doesn't even have to mean banning entry, just requiring 2 week managed quarantine for anyone entering the state."
3677,"Hong Kong and Taiwan manage such quarantines with electronic monitoring, NZ and Aus use hotels."
3678,In both the US and UK there was a window when they could have eliminated the virus.
3679,"By summer numbers were very low in most US states, lower than Victoria during its outbreak."
3680,The same was true in the UK.
3681,"A lockdown then, instead of opening up could have eliminated the virus and prevented the massive autumn/winter wave."
3682,But by then the whole thing was so politicised in the US that it was impossible.
3683,"So again, it was the incompetent politicians politicising the pandemic and failing to provide the economic support needed for a lengthy elimination lockdown, and a culture so willing to go along with that which doomed the US and to a lesser extent the UK."
3684,Onion under snag = totalitarian government

3698,However the city of melbourne is more dense with humans than any area of england and we defeated it here.

3701,"Yeah it would be, but you’re absolutely sure long term effects are rare?"
3702,Yeah it was fuckng awful here especially in Victoria.

3704,We are trapped.
3705,I hate it.
3706,I'd love to be travelling right now if I could.
3707,Life also wont be normal until we have no masks completely and these other idiots get over their little virtue signaling high horses.
3708,Back in March/April when the case numbers were growing and control measures were being implemented Australia was heading into winter.
3709,If the summer heat is an advantage against the virus then the Northern Hemisphere squandered it.
3710,How do you imagine we achieved single digit daily cases?

3744,It wasn't just borders though - people weren't allowed to travel more than 5km away from their home.
3745,It's more meaningful to enforce that rather than state borders.

3782,In Tasmania after the SA quarantine outbreak our government agreed to pay workers a full time wage even if they weren't working full time and a bonus just for doing a generally pretty boring but also probably the most important job in the State.
3783,"And these people had the nerve to co-opt the ""my body, my choice' slogan."

3789,What are you talking about?
3790,"You can come back to Australia, you just have to get tested and go through a 2 week quarantine."
3791,That one case has caused 85%of that state to go intimate lockdown too so a quick response to stop the spread.
3792,A bit of a panic because it looks to be the UK strain

3811,WA is a big state but it's population is concentrated in Perth.
3812,2 million are living in the Perth metro area at a density of 320/km² (830/mi²).
3813,It's not particularly dense but 80% of the state population is in only one city.
3814,The population is concentrated though in Perth and the South West.
3815,"Fwiw some health experts have said we can then

&gt;Even if Dr. Fauci is right and it will take 85 or even 90 percent herd immunity to completely stop coronavirus transmission, Dr. Lipsitch said, “we can still defang the virus sooner than that.”

&gt;He added: “We don’t have to have zero transmission in order to have a decent society."
3816,"We have lots of diseases, like flu, transmitting all the time, and we don’t shut down society for that."
3817,"If we can vaccinate almost all the people who are most at risk of severe outcomes, then this would become a milder disease.”

3823,"The number of people crossing the state border is much higher than in Australia, and the number of roads crossing the border is such that it's impossible to have check points everywhere."

3834,"A shame he wasn't tough on making sure people working in quarantine hotels didn't have a second job which could easily be fixed by paying them a full time wage regardless of hours, which is what other States stared doing after the second time it happened."
3835,Actually adding that up you would get 18 million.
3836,Which means it would take less than 100 days from that point to hit our goal of all 18+ vaccinated before summer.

3841,"Because 95% of the world did handle the virus worse than us, Taiwan faired better because they’ve suffered before, they had plans in place and followed them, strictly."
3842,"Now let’s talk about the US, Germany, Japan, Italy, France, the UK, any number of world powers who have suffered great losses, Australia has faired decently and discounting the odd few who claim “draconian measures” the majority of our population is happy with the measures being taken, hence the landslide victory with the qld state elections, Anastasias border policy is massively popular with Queenslanders."
3843,"Yes, the tennis debacle is atrocious, as was the afl, but I think it comes down to a balance, which we haven’t worked out perfectly yet."
3844,We’re still in a better position than much of the world and that will show in the coming months.
3845,I didn't say it wasn't the case elsewhere.
3846,"I was discussing the public reaction to this specific lockdown as it relates to the circumstances of Western Australia, where I live and which this article is about."
3847,"I'm sorry if you've personally faced challenges from strict lockdowns during this pandemic, but my comment is in no way is an attack or judgement on other peoples circumstances."
3848,"A person can discuss a particular subject, without it somehow being a critique on whatever other related subjects they're not discussing."
3849,Some very good points there.
3850,I agree there are some out there who remain ignorant to those who are downright nutters - both private citizens and those in public life.
3851,However I believe - and am grateful for the fact - that these types have not yet reached critical mass to the degree where they have in other countries.
3852,It is those countries who unfortunately will be holding back the rest of the world in eradicating this.
3853,"I don't see the part where /u/TazJayC said other places don't do this, or aren't like this."
3854,You're jumping the gun a bit.
3855,"I also feel like these rich fucks also spend more time doing riskier activities and putting poor workers at risk, so at least maybe it spares the people who unfortunately have to come into contact with them because our safety net sucks."
3856,I agree with you though- this probably could’ve been done in a more fair and equitable way truly had someone else been running this vaccine program but now that it’s been going on almost two months it’s kind of like welp just jab whoever is around to be jabbed.
3857,It is a huge controversy to a close a state border in the U.S.
3858,It isn't such a big deal in Australia.
3859,"It is also a lot harder to control border closures, but that is another matter."
3860,"Moral of the story is, governments can't just do what they want, ignoring their voters and bases."
3861,"Even with Trump out of office, you won't see Biden suddenly hold a summit with state governors to close borders, enforce hard lockdowns etc."
3862,"What you will see is a change in posture that promotes mask wearing, self isolating."
3863,You might see some mandates around masks and stuff for U.S federal government workers and buildings.
3864,But nothing like what Australia has.
3865,And the reason is that people wouldn't accept it as readily as Aussies do.
3866,Which isn't to say no one in Australia disagrees with the government.
3867,"Just that Australians won't make it a big deal, and will still vote for premiers and leaders that implement strict measures."
3868,So we should pay for their shit basically?
3869,That’s what I’m hoping.
3870,Well just ease into it
3871,No because the contract only specified best effort rather than guaranteed deliveries
3872,opposite here!
3873,"when i see i have a slightly higher temp for most people, it means i have a fever."
3874,more people need to understand that 98.6° is not one size fits all.
3875,These lockdowns better persist or I’m done going outside anymore.
3876,To hell with all of the business owners who suffered great losses.
3877,I don’t think anyone will ever say that.
3878,What’s going to happen is that governments will let up on all restrictions and people will start feeling safe to do the things they did before the pandemic.
3879,"That’s how normalcy will happen, no one can wave a magic wand and say “it’s normal now”"
3880,yeah 20s most days is pretty mild?
3881,[deleted]
3882,&gt;Do you have a mandatory quarantine system for incoming arrivals?
3883,better question is did they have a mandatory quarantine in *March* 2020. becomes a fucktonne less effective the longer you delay it.
3884,i think a study was released early on about a 3 day delay in lockdowns -&gt; 3 week extra time needs to be spent to get stamp it out

3887,Boy that's not happening in my state (Oregon).
3888,The county health department here has no clue when they are getting any vaccine until the day before they get them.
3889,If anything it's gotten worse here and half of the rules have gone out the window.
3890,"If there’s one thing I believe about this pandemic here in the US, one of main enablers of it has just been human stupidity."
3891,It sounds stupid to say I haven’t thought of this - but my hospital is the same.
3892,No one on my unit is out with covid except people who got it in Dec/early Jan before the vaccine and are still sick.
3893,Nearly all our staff is vaccinated and it’s been weeks since I’ve known if anyone out with covid.
3894,[deleted]
3895,At what point do you think the media / politicians / health experts will finally crack and admit that normalcy will come when the most at risk are inoculated and not when some magic “zero covid / 90% threshold” thing is reached?
3896,The R-value calculated by FHM in Sweden is around 0.9 at the moment.
3897,The R-value on that site says it's 0.3 based on deaths.
3898,"They would probably have gotten a more accurate number if they took the reported deaths last week instead of deaths occuring last week, since this number isn't complete."
3899,I think these numbers should be taken with a grain of salt if the same uncertainty exist in the data sources for other countries
3900,Canada has no vaccine manufacturing infrastructure unfortunately

3902,Yea the older I get the more I realize that time has a way of massively changing public opinion of an event.
3903,"It's been very interesting watching the R's go from being thought of as the ""pro war"" party to the ""anti war"" party under Trump, and the D's being so opposed to the mid-east wars right up until Trump started pulling troops out."
3904,And man did the D's ever hate GW!
3905,"Wow, I remember so many people on the left thought he was the absolute Hitler of our age when he left office, and it's been fascinating watching everyone kind of embrace him over a decade later."
3906,Even here on left-leaning Reddit people fawn over him (like whenever that video of him throwing out the first pitch after 9/11 is shown).
3907,"And if you scroll through the comments of glowing praise of GW you'll always find some older confused person in the comments saying something like ""wait, do we like GWB now?"""
3908,lol.
3909,It always cracks me up a little.
3910,"It will be interesting what the future generations think of Obama, Trump etc."
3911,I think time will have a way of smoothing out the rough edges of all of them.
3912,"Everyone's so passionate (love Trump or hate Trump) now, but I wouldn't be surprised if in 10 years emotions have dulled on both sides and we will have moved on to whatever the new crises is."

3936,"A lot of edgy libertarians will scoff at this, but the average Australian has never had to fear government."
3937,Not in the way many other countries have.
3938,That isn't to say Aussies never whinge about government.
3939,"But its usually pissing and moaning about them being paid too much, or they always put a spin on every topic."
3940,You don't hear Aussies whinging that the secret police are going to round them up if government is allowed any more power.
3941,"As such both political parties can do things like border closures, lockdowns, mandatory quarantines, and they won't lose any meaningful support."

3949,Since inauguration... you mean like literally 10 days ago????

3952,Yes I am.
3953,I guess most people take the conspiracy theories seriously on this sub.

3955,"But the process to put a chip on the market and its slight variants (or revision) seems analogous to the one for a vaccine (need to be tested in various conditions/populations, long term effects (micro-chips don't last forever), interfacing with other chips vs reactions with hosts etc ...)"
3956,"Mate, there is simply not enough vaccine in Europe."
3957,"Only Denmark is vaccinating at a higher rate, and Italy is similar."
3958,All other countries in the EU are behind.

3984,The only thing the feds might *consider* doing is passing laws demanding such accountability from states.
3985,"Such laws could involve shaming states and even individual hospitals that perform poorly (color-coded maps and rankings based on efficiency in giving out vaccines), financial incentives and penalties, etc."

4043,It makes no sense.

4053,"&gt; Israel should have finished vaccinating the oldest part of its population a few weeks ago 

Not really, we've only started giving out second doses 3 weeks ago, with most of them administered in the last two weeks (nearly half of all of them in the last week)."
4054,two weeks ago only 2.6% of the Israeli population got second dose.
4055,Then there's the deaths lag behind hospitalization that lag behind new cases which means that we need to wait a while for the drop to manifest as most only got second dose very recently.
4056,"Another large factor is that there is a lot of variance between demographics, in some demographics the % of elderly vaccination is extremely low, and too often the same demographics have some of the largest COVID spread and unwillingness to follow restriction."
4057,"The differences are sometimes massive, in secular cities like Ranana and Kiryat Mozkin you have 50% after 1st dose 30% after second, while Jerusalem it's 20% and 10%, or Beitar Elit with 8% and 3.5% (the numbers aren't as bad as they first appear as the later cities have much younger demographic but it's still very significant)."
4058,"This manifests in different results, [this](https://rotter.net/User_files/forum/6015da1b22ed52191.jpg) is a graph of change in number of cases in the 10 most vaccinated cities, [this](https://rotter.net/User_files/forum/6015da0e223b249e1.jpg) is in the 10 least vaccinated."
4059,"So it's lag, a lot of spread in general and the fact that those choosing to vaccinate first also tending to be the responsible people creates this situation."
4060,We should be seeing hospitalizations drop in the coming weeks.
4061,I'd be surprised if we don't have a huge drop before two weeks from today.
4062,The early wave states in the northeast are doing worse now than Florida is now.

4082,In general....it may be that people like stay at home more isn't just a failing upon them or wrong...but could be a symptom of the system they work within being wrong somehow.
4083,"That stay at home is a respite from a shitty work environment...because of how our overall economy works to budget our lives as much as possible....because the rich take the rest via tax relief and grants unecessarily....as a form of embezzlement from society...they can't do it all at once, but slowly over time...by creating not too obvious policies that weaken the general economy bit by bit."
4084,The reason we focus upon the stock market is because it distracts us away from the economy most of us live in...while supporting an economy in spirit that benefits the rich almost exclusively...controlling our behaviors by guiding us upon frugality for ourselves while doing what was best for the stock market.

4181,"The neighborhood mentioned was THE hardest hit in all of NYC, so to have those from out of the community fill up the appointment slots meant for those within the community shows that there are (and this is where you are correct), gaps in the process that need to be improved."
4182,"In the meantime, this is what has happened as a result: the community, which is mostly Latino, is missing out on vaccines intended to help this particularly intensely hit community, and those who aren’t in the community (mostly White folks) are coming in to take those vaccines."
4183,"Now, obviously the process needs tweaking, and this article merely points that out."
4184,It most certainly isn’t race baiting to point out where the facts are.
4185,It is NO SECRET that COVID-19 has u disproportionately affected more minority groups than can be explained by genetics alone.

4256,They lost their jobs because there was not remotely enough government assistance.
4257,Some of them absolutely.
4258,But some of them lost their jobs as a direct result of the shutdown because businesses did not want to pay employees for not working.
4259,"When I said they were both true, you told me I was wrong even though New Zealand and Australia both point to it being true."
4260,Both the Lockdowns and lack of government assistance led to loss of jobs.
4261,The first dose is 2/3 effective by itself and there are also millions of infections which have created a base level of natural immunity.
4262,"If the CDC estimate of a true caseload history of about 8x the positive tested cases is accurate in the UK, about 45% of UK citizens have already had the virus."
4263,45% + ~13% that have been vaccinated at least once is 58%.
4264,That is certainly enough to broach pseudo-herd immunity in light of the ongoing restrictions.
4265,"It’s not enough for true herd immunity, but if the present R value, including restrictions but not immunity, is below about 2.4, 58% would be enough to crush spread."

4306,The second is Astrazeneca wich will be produced by The Oswaldo Cruz Foundation in partnership with the UK Astrazeneca.

4331,"All we can think of her now is how douchey and cringeworthy that was, considering so many others could have gotten it over her."
4332,More spread has led to more mutations.
4333,"Also very important is that the virus is interacting with previously infected and resistant individuals, thus selecting for immune evading mutants."
4334,Ideal would be vaccinating on a very low disease spread background.
4335,We are likely to see various vaccine evading mutants in the coming months.

4371,That must be why you said it makes no sense for them to pay anyone who isn't working.
4372,&gt;I'm saying what businesses literally did after they got assistance.
4373,They did not get the assistance I have spoken to.
4374,&gt;You said it wasn't true that people lost their jobs due to the shutdowns when it literally happened.
4375,"And I am correct, that is not what literally happened."
4376,Please stop lying.
4377,They lost their jobs because there was not remotely enough government assistance.
4378,&gt;I agree with that.
4379,More assistance would've kept more people employed.
4380,I'm not arguing that.
4381,I'm arguing it shutdowns did have an effect.
4382,No you aren't.
4383,You are trying to make it sound like government assistance doesn't work and can't work.
4384,If that isn't your goal you are doing an amazing impersonation.
4385,You completely removed the context of additional government assistance from your first response in a cowardly attempt to support your own objectively incorrect position.
4386,I explained how additional financial assistance would have had a cascading effect of keeping more businesses solvent and more employees paid.
4387,"You ignored that, too."
4388,"Your response to actual proof that the assistance I mentioned resulted in fewer closed businesses was a logical fallacy that ""These two countries had good government responses but some people still lost their jobs!""."
4389,Many businesses had to lock their doors and tell their employees to stay home because of COVID.
4390,"Then, ***because of a lack of government assistance***, those businesses no longer had enough money to continue paying their employees."
4391,Because of a lack of regulations and laws there was no safety net set up for those businesses or employees and the people in power at the time decided not to do remotely enough.
4392,If that assistance had actually been provided then many more businesses could have been able to keep many more employees on their books even if they didn't have to or were unable to directly paying them.
4393,"Fewer layoffs, fewer firings, just extensive LOAs, furloughs, sabbaticals, whatever you want to call it."

4405,They don't seem to be motivated by caring about other people.
4406,I think they want others to agree with them and support their ideas no matter what.
4407,Any favorite sites that have been clearly fact-checking scientific misinformation about the covid vaccine and maybe writing it in an easily digestible fashion?
4408,"My father is hesitant to take the vaccine because he's been watching America's Frontline Doctors on youtube, etc."

4412,Not entirely stupid.
4413,AMLO is promoting “covid isn’t that bad” type of news.
4414,So picture this...AMLO says on the news that covid is cool.
4415,Then a person on Facebook instantly parrots that fallacy straight from Mexico.

4460,"Med student here, but I think you may have your vaccines mixed up."
4461,"In the U.S., people are given an inactivated form of the virus, to which you produce antibodies against."
4462,An inactivated virus is made up of dead viral particles and has no chance of being reverted back to a live harmful virus.
4463,"In developing countries, oral polio vaccines might be given due to the cheap cost and ability to create immunity in the community, since it can be spread quite easily by the fecal-oral route."
4464,"This is the vaccine that contains a weaker version of the live virus and has a small chance of reverting to its wildtype form, potentially causing polio in someone who isn't vaccinated."
4465,"With regards to the influenza vaccine, there are various forms as well (attenuated vs. killed), but the main purpose is to protect you against certain strains of the flu."
4466,"Scientists have to predict every year which strains they believe will be most prevalent during the flu season, but aren't 100% correct all of the time."
4467,"The flu shot is not meant to make the flu less severe, there are other medications used for that purpose (i.e."
4468,Tamiflu).
4469,"Thank god PA is back on track, we had 2 days of data dumps from days to weeks previous, one day at &gt;9k cases, that was a little scary, but now we are back to dropping downward."

4472,The goal of lockdowns is not to turn the curve.
4473,The curve will go down when the virus can´t find vectors to replicate.
4474,It happened even in Sweden.

I received the first dosage of the moderna vaccine exactly two weeks ago."
4488,"I experienced the usual side effects, chills the first night, and then my arm swelling up at the injection site the next day and generally hurting like someone took a baseball bat to it."
4489,I was fine after like 3 days.
4490,"Three days ago, the lymph nodes around my neck have been hurting like hell, to the point it hurts to swallow, and I hear a crackling in my ears (both ears hurt as well)."
4491,Also my head has been hurting non stop too.
4492,Two nights ago I was feeling extremely nauseous on top of that.
4493,I can’t seem to figure out if these are continued side effects of the vaccine.
4494,Only reason I’m doubtful is because this would be such a delayed reaction since it’s been 2 weeks already.
4495,"Has anyone gotten either of the vaccines yet, and has experienced anything similar?"
4496,I gave a call to my doctors office yesterday and the receptionist said these don’t sound like covid symptoms and I may be coming down with something.
4497,"Unfortunately I’m waiting for a new insurance to kick in, so I don’t want to go in and pay out of pocket unless absolutely necessary."
4498,"Currently my head is hurting, I’m feeling really cold, and my throat and neck feel so tight and sore, almost like someone is choking me."
4499,Don’t know what to make of all this.
4500,Daily new Covid cases in the United States has dropped from a peak of 260k/d down to 160k/d.
4501,"As tests reports lag infection start days by a couple of dates, we likely are already down 60%."
4502,The United Kingdom has seen an even bigger drop.
4503,"Very little of this change has been due to the vaccination program which will take a bit longer to meaningfully show up in the data, but will get credit for “ending” the pandemic."
4504,"Not saying the vaccine isn’t great and I certainly am eager to get the shots, but it is not much of a factor for the decline in cases."
4505,"In reality, the pandemic by the end of Dec 2020 has burned through the groups that spread the pandemic the most, and are also disproportionately more likely to get infected since the two things are related."
4506,Why would they?
4507,That has to be done at the local level.
4508,"Nobody ""dumped it"" on anybody."
4509,"They sent out pre-planning surveys, demanded every state formulate a plan that had to be vetted, and put out tons of guidance, protocols, considerations etc."

4511,It's not their fault that states have fucked up their only job (executing a clearly laid out playbook.)
4512,As far as making employees put in the effort to do the vaccinations?
4513,That's up to the states and hospitals.
4514,"I won't worry about it unless your parents develop symptoms, most people who are exposed do not get infected."
4515,"Infection rates for non-household members are normally below 5%, for household members probably 10%-30%."

4539,As a parent it was extremely stressful to see him go through it knowing there was nothing I could do to help.
4540,So dumb.
4541,Everyone should be online
4542,It's not *known* if those vaccinated will still be able to do spread Covid-19.
4543,"I think the assumption is that those vaccinated will spread much less, but there is technically no conclusive data on that specific question."
4544,"What is known in the overall effectiveness numbers is whether someone vaccinated contracts Covid-19, when, and how serious."
4545,"It's certainly reasonable to assume that those vaccinated would contribute significantly less to spreading Covid-19, and I expect data will emerge to that effect, but in the meantime, maintain physical distancing and masking requirements."

4681,So it’s enough to make most people immune and it’s not as bad for the rest.
4682,Is 95% better?

4695,I’ve seen so many images and videos using the highest death tolls and still see so many people around.
4696,Even people WITHOUT A MASK IN A SUPERMARKT WTF
4697,Just imagine what the virus qill do to you.
4698,You will probably have 2 weeks of all this + even more severe.
4699,It occurs to me I have only ever heard that phrase spoken.
4700,"English is wack, yo!"
4701,https://writingexplained.org/lede-vs-lead-difference
4702,The overall fatality is 1-2% sure.
4703,But that's for all age ranges.
4704,The fatality rate in an age range where you're starting to worry if it could be their last Xmas is much much higher.
4705,"You're not going to go visit a guy in their 20s thinking, ""I have to see them as this could be their last Xmas""

If we're talking someone in their 70s plus, then the fatality rate is closer to 8% and 14% for over 80."
4706,"And even if Covid doesn't kill them, it could ruin their health and lead to an earlier death or severely reduced quality of life."
4707,Just so you could spend one Christmas together?
4708,Selfish.
4709,Vaccines are nearly here.
4710,Many in their 70s - 80s in many countries have already had them within 1 month of Xmas.
4711,So worst case you could have waited just one month and had a belated Xmas with them in a massively safer scenario for them.
4712,"There are care homes reporting zero fatalities after all residents had the vaccine, just one month after Xmas."
4713,There was no logical statistical excuse to go visit an elderly relative last Xmas.

4715,And this is why I'm also not really a monarchist but also not really a republican: I think the current constitution/status quo works very well.

4717,When you don't even know if I'm white or not?
4718,My reddit avatar is a meme lol.
4719,Goes to show who's the one that's really basing everything off of race here.
4720,I dunno I agree with the post that cultural mask wearing can't possibly explain a 350x reduction in fatalities.
4721,And being an island nation doesn't matter once the virus is on the island.
4722,One possible explanation is that Tokyo was somehow super vigilant early on and successfully contained and traced every case and eliminated them.
4723,"To consider that happening in a huge, densely populated city is kind of impossible for me."
4724,But I agree that another explanation is a difference in how the fatalities are reported.
4725,"For example it has been found that 95% of the people that died with covid had other serious health conditions like diabetes, heart disease etc."
4726,"What if Japan only reported covid deaths that were exclusively from the virus, i.e."
4727,"people who died ""from"" the virus rather than ""with"" the virus?"
4728,This would reduce the number of fatalities by 95%.
4729,An even simpler explanation is that some countries simply don't report these numbers publicly to other countries to look better.
4730,I feel pretty sure that China is doing this for example.
4731,Why would they be honest about it?
4732,Agree completely with this.
4733,I live less than 2 hours from 6 different states and live in a 7th.
4734,"If I was eligible in any of them, I'm sorry but I would be willing to drive one state over to do it."
4735,"A national strategy absolutely would have helped this, and I blame the CDC for this, primarily, but also the way the country works in general is not helpful in this situation."
4736,A little cold in late August but that's it.
4737,Basically lots of sneezing and a runny nose for two days.
4738,My daughter has been in daycare but with their precautions she hasn't been bringing home the same old things.
4739,We've all been really healthy.
4740,You mean like a drug that uses the spike protein to enter cells?
4741,Interesting thought and I have no idea.
4742,"Ah yep you’re right there, fkin insane there’s always been one state with COVID over this whole time."
4743,Feels like we are on a donut streak so often
4744,I did plenty and I think you are wrong
4745,"Yeah, I think it's a choice between two somewhat unfathomable situations."
4746,I don't think you can reasonably ask young people to simply avoid seeing their parents.
4747,"Has that ever been done, ever?"
4748,"Similarly, how can nursing homes be completely protected?"
4749,They are presumably staffed by people under 65.
4750,"The issue is each state is getting doses based on our population, and it’s really not enough."
4751,In nyc for example in Washington heights (a very heavily minority neighborhood) there’s a vaccine distribution center.
4752,"A lot of people are coming over from Jersey or westchester and getting shots while the local community, who might not have had the free time to keep refreshing the pages etc to get a position in line, is left out."
4753,"The lines are almost all white people, who don’t even pay tax in the city that’s funding these centers and probably are ok working from home anyway."
4754,So yeah people are going to be mad.
4755,"IMO they should just target select areas where there’s bad outbreaks first, like LA county, while production continues to increase."
4756,We'd love to... if we had the doses.
4757,Thousands of first vaccination appointments had to be postponed with the recent announcement of delays from AZ and Moderna.
4758,"Ok, [let’s add the US to the comparison](https://ourworldindata.org/coronavirus-data-explorer?zoomToSelection=true&amp;minPopulationFilter=1000000&amp;time=2020-09-02..latest&amp;country=SWE~DNK~USA&amp;region=World&amp;deathsMetric=true&amp;interval=smoothed&amp;perCapita=true&amp;smoothing=7&amp;pickerMetric=location&amp;pickerSort=asc) and discover that deaths per million are on the same level in Sweden and the US while Denmark is considerably below that."
4759,Good news.
4760,An article without a paywall would be great.
4761,"I got strep, thank goodness for antibiotics since that was miserable."
4762,I had a cold in December.
4763,Got tested for covid and it was negative so it was just a cold.
4764,I also have a chronic disease.
4765,Not millions.
4766,The test group the data was based on had around 600k vaccinated.
4767,Of which 317 became infected after a week they were deemed ‘immune’ of which 16 were hospitalised.
4768,The data is good.
4769,But I would say it is somewhat premature to call it a triumph.
4770,Hope to be wrong.
4771,"&gt;Please keep in mind, even once you are vaccinated you can still be a carrier!!"
4772,"&gt;

What proof of this is there"
4773,There are over 12k variants.
4774,Reinfection is very rare and would have to be with a strain with a different spike protein.
4775,"Please stop fearmongering the rest of us, it’s very difficult to find optimism nowadays."
4776,"This follows the Guardian’s Law - ‘whatever it is, it’s due to capitalism and racism’"
4777,"Nah, they’ll be back."

4824,The most obvious example is nursing homes where the residents literally can't leave meanwhile 40% of fatalities have occurred there.

4845,Whether that positive mindset changed as soon as the Covaxin was given approval along with Covishield is something you need to think about.
4846,I have never seen this much of opposition in general public in India as much as I have seen since the approval of the said vaccine.
4847,If you haven't notice that then I think you should come out of the reddit bubble and come check out the ground reality.
4848,I don't see governments pushing vaccinations in rural healthcare workers for that matter.
4849,If you remember correctly we did dry runs here before the approval.
4850,If we go by those statistics we had infrastructure ready to vaccinate 1M people a day.
4851,We are yet to touch that mark.

4862,"He kept saying a different number for herd immunity (60%, then 70%, 80%, etc) I think as a way to try to convince more people to take the vaccine."
4863,Every time there is a positive development such as the vaccine he tells us the bad news.
4864,"I get that he is trying to encourage people to keep lockdown measures even while vaccinations are happening, but he is ""that guy"" that just gives the most pessimistic and skeptical possibility in a situation."
4865,Nah were talking maybe a few in each vaccine.

4877,They weren't really told that.
4878,"One health minister advised, that in order for the immune system to be working optimally, it was advisable to stop drinking before an after the vaccine."
4879,Which they then said was basically standard advice for any vaccine taken.
4880,"While the developers of the vaccine themselves,  said it was fine to continue drinking in moderation."
4881,"As usual, reports were then sensationalized in the western media."
4882,I think you make a good point here.
4883,Right now it’s about protecting each other with our actions.

4950,I asked the doctor why he didn't stick it all the way up my nose and he said that it was just a rapid.
4951,"HOWEVER, a few months prior, my dad got REALLY sick (throwing up, couldn't get out of bed) and doctors did the real covid test on him, so maybe they save it for those who are worse off?"
4952,Not sure
4953,It doesn’t have to be complex.
4954,It’s literally the same system that has been the standard for years.
4955,"Plenty of schools are properly ventilated, and here you are trying to pretend like you know more than the CDC."

4976,Then what you are saying is that lockdowns are impossible because we somehow can't possibly keep people separate.
4977,If they are impossible then why are we doing them?
4978,If you can do them for the entire population then you can do them for a subset of the population.
4979,We celebrated the holidays with our in-laws and other family via zoom while the older folks were happy at home with delivered groceries.

So, from memory we have:

Pfizer: Approved

Moderna: Approved

AZ:Approved

Sanofi: Likely failed*, production switching to pfizer."

5063,"Curevac: Can't recall any new news on that vaccine, gone quiet?"
5064,"Novavax: Recently concluded stage 3 trials, results look good and production may start soon, however it's another one that the EU was very late to sign up for."
5065,"UK approval expected in March, EU possibly April."
5066,"Valneva: Yet another that the EU was very very late to sign up for, mass production has started in the UK already, stage 3 trials are yet to start, UK authorisation may be in Summer, so that's certainly out of the current urgent timeframe."
5067,"It's worth noting that of the several that the EU signed up late for there are big questions over contracts and deliveries priorities, as clearly that has been a bit of a weakness..."
5068,"It looks like the EU should focus on ramping up production on AZ, Pfizer and prepare for J+J, I would be amazed if; 1: Germany didn't want to start it's own trials on the Russian/Chinese drugs, 2: The EU comission let them go that way, Hungary is one thing, one of the pillar nations of the EU?"
5069,Not so sure.
5070,3: EU industries didn't throw their weight and protest by the backdoor at funds going to Russia/China.
5071,$: The EU populations didn't reject those drugs and risk increasing anti-vax movements.

5073,Damn.
5074,I was hoping for a cure to my general air of nihilistic cynicism.
5075,I honestly don't know.
5076,The policy makers have never really seemed that in touch with the facts and even Fauci seems to be playing some kind of game of dangling a carrot in front of everyone that never gets any closer.
5077,And there is part of me that worries that people like Fauci are loving the limelight so much that they won't say anything that brings the situation to an end because they'll stop being famous.
5078,We have become such an attention-whore culture.
5079,I feel pretty sure that hospitalizations and fatalities are going to drop precipitously in the next few weeks.
5080,Hopefully they don't need to see zero cases or zero illnesses or something before they change their minds.

5085,The FDA wouldn’t allow for the use of a product if the company couldn’t accurately prove in clinical trials that it was in fact working.
5086,The more likely issue is that it’s some variant we aren’t aware of yet.
5087,We’re so focused right now on administering the vaccine that we aren’t taking the time to keep testing people in mass numbers to even see what is out there.
5088,It’s very likely that there are a number of variants that haven’t even been reported on simply because we aren’t looking for them in the extent we need to be.

5267,If only it was exponential!
5268,It's currently very linear averaging an extra 15k per day.

5280,"I'm a professional chef and very passionate about cooking and eating, so this is a HUGE part of what makes me anxious about COVID!"
5281,"Whatever ""long term side effects"" of the vaccine are infinitely less than whatever ""long term side effects"" you'd get from COVID."
5282,The vaccine is less effective because it is a single shot and it is a traditional vaccine formulation.
5283,The mRNA vaccines are modern miracles that are like sniper rifles that train the immune system on the best protein to build antibodies against.
5284,Think if it as two months (two doses) of Navy Seal training.

5293,"Yeah, who needs a job or a social life?"
5294,Australia is basically just a penal colony again.
5295,My main issue is that people are basically acting like the vaccine isn’t doing much while simultaneously really urging people to get it.
5296,"If you’re gonna encourage people to get it, make sure they know that any form of distancing or masking is completely useless once they’ve gotten their second dose and all of that."
5297,Restrictions need to start seriously easing once the vulnerable have been vaccinated because COVID doesn’t pose a significant threat to anyone else.
5298,Your parents dont let you use google?
5299,Wtf
5300,Would you mind linking that for me?
5301,I haven’t seen it and would love to!
5302,Distance learning is not remotely comparable to the real thing.

5309,Where are you getting that from?
5310,We’ve given 10s of millions of vaccines.
5311,We need to average just shy of 400k a day to get to that target now.
5312,It looks like we're going to smash what was once seen as overly ambitious target!
5313,Morning everyone.

5316,We’re gonna make it through this and we’re gonna have the best summer of our lives.
5317,Lmao mate I live in Perth.
5318,It’s the first outbreak since the shit hit the fan.
5319,We’ve enjoyed quite a normal reality up till a single case got out and the lock downs going to last 5 days.
5320,Not weeks or months.
5321,What a bell end.
5322,"In my neighborhood right outside NYC, kids have been playing together with no masks since this began."
5323,"Yes, that would be my judgment."
5324,Plus ignoring Fe means good bedside manner and positive customer/patient experience is not only ignored but like...actively suppressed.
5325,"Even those vaccines well known to prevent disease or serious disease but not prevent infection, like pertussis, rotavirus, influenza, etc., still all *reduce* transmission."
5326,"They don't prevent it altogether, but they reduce it - pertussis outbreaks, for example, can generally be traced, instead of being carried through a long chain of vaccinated people and showing up at surprise locations around the country."
5327,They have discovered immortality in Australia?
5328,"I hope we are in a position to help you guys out soon, the death and hospitalization average in the UK is still so very high though, almost 10x Canadas."
5329,Anti vaxers and incompetent leadership are responsible for a majority of the deaths.
5330,There is blood on your hands.
5331,Yes I was in my 20s in 2009.
5332,Also as I said to another comment: those schools didn’t offer an online option like schools in 2020 did.
5333,"No US school closed from COVID-19, they’ve all remained open via distance learning"
5334,Can someone explain what is going on with UAE?
5335,"They're almost at 30% vaccinated, but their cases are on the rise quite severely (at least according to googling ""covid stats UAE"")."
5336,"I don't want to come off as a naysayer, and I definitely want my vaccine ASAP, but looking at that has me worried there might be an issue..."
5337,"For the Americans, this would be like if youse gave over 3 million vaccinations in a single day."
5338,"Yes, I think when we do the post-mortem on the pandemic, our response in the educational right now will be seen as woeful."
5339,There are so many kids who have essentially lost a year to a year and a half of schooling.

5351,"I understand the frustration, and wanting to do it earlier, but it would make more sense to be on the same page until then."

5397,Even Cuomo has said that
5398,This is probably the biggest concern even if everyone on Earth were willing &amp; able to get the vaccine(s).
5399,"The amount of time to actually make, ship, administer it to 8bn people could take long enough that by the time you're done the last people the virus has already mutated to a form that isn't as protected from via the vaccines."

5433,We should carefully monitor this and understand what it means.
5434,This isn’t fake news as maybe some would say.
5435,"&gt;  
&gt;The second is that the news of the mutations and the implications they bring is being over sensationalized by the media, as the media has been doing with every speedbump over the course of this entire pandemic."
5436,I think this is what people are a little sick of.
5437,"No, the mutations aren’t ‘fake news’ but really the headline that should be shared with the public is vaccines still prevent severe illness from all known mutations thus far."
5438,"If you have a jar of 1000 jellybeans and one green jellybean, it is disingenuous to center the story of the jellybeans around the colour green."

5480,"Today we can work from home, from most jobs, and we stay home, so the waves are much lower."
5481,"That means, more time to reach people."
5482,This also gives more time for the virus to mutate more.
5483,So vaccine will have difficult time catching the virus mutations.
5484,"I believe the war against pandemics will be won, when treatments like antivirus and others taken when one is infected."
5485,"This will be more powerfull then vaccines itself, because vaccines will take long to take, and will loose power with future virus mutations."
5486,"Also quick tests that take 3 minutes and can be used in home, and are so diffused as are masks today, will make a big impact."
5487,Probably not the best idea to run constant hitpieces on these vaccines when most western countries probably have backchannel contacts with Russia and China over their vaccines.

5503,"That seems reasonable for now, but there will be significant pressure to make those requirements more lax as soon as cases drop from vaccinations."
5504,Most likely they'll stop delaying because there's less urgency to do so now that cases and deaths are declining and therefore they're less panicked.
5505,Also there's more doses coming.
5506,Now you're kinda weirding me out 0\_0

5592,You would think that the same people that say children are our future would want to actually protect children from a virus that we have no idea what is doing to them in the long term.
5593,What kind of future is a child going to have if they develop COPD because people forced them to be exposed to Covid over and over?
5594,"I would guess that some GP's didn't change the bookings on some of the more challenging vaccinations, ie."
5595,specialised care homes etc.
5596,If it was already pre-booked and organised they might have just kept with the original time table for simplicities sake.
5597,Also vaccination centres with end of day surpluses may have done 2nd jabs on workers or call-ins rather than risk binning vials.

5602,The reason this shutdown is unprecedented is that this virus is also unprecedented in modern history in how difficult it is to contain.
5603,"Most viruses you can just quarantine everyone symptomatic and you're fine, but that doesn't work with this."

5608,I’m unsure if you were actually disagreeing with anything I said?
5609,"I agree that these variants are not the end of the world, but given that we have actual research on the impact of these variants on practical outcomes thanks to the J&amp;J and Novavax trials, we don’t really need to speculate based on in vitro research."
5610,"It's risky not so much because of the vaccine itself, but because unexpected delays can always happen."
5611,Remember when the EU was threatening to block exports and suddenly all British redditors seemed incredibly concerned about that?
5612,The answer is probably unexpected for you.

5627,&gt;The UK refusing to give away their own vaccines to the EU is not the same as the EU preventing supplies intended for the British people from reaching the UK.
5628,The perspective of the EU in that matter is that the facilities in the UK were always meant to produce for the EU as well.
5629,"No one is suggesting the UK should get less then they ordered from these facilities, though."
5630,The *only* implication involving the UK so far regard AZ vaccines from the EU facilities.
5631,BionTech will not be touched as long as they fulfill their obligations to the EU.
5632,"Should they *not* do that,  I wonder how anyone could argue that the UK (or anyone else) should be treated preferentially."

5666,"If the media and “experts” are to be believed, we may be asked to distance again this Christmas"
5667,US had a huge pharmaceutical industry and the ability to make vaccines at scale along with a huge amount of global influence and money.
5668,They will ramp it up big time and I wouldn’t be surprised to see them do 3m or more a day soon.
5669,Last year they did 3m flu doses a day
5670,Just wait until they realize there are already 25k troops fighting CoVID19 on deployment orders and tens of thousands of others fighting it in military hospitals across the country.

5674,Mark my words bidens federal response is going to be a train wreck.
5675,"First , the fbi background check will take months."
5676,Then they will have to be issued ids.
5677,Then there will be the affirmative action training.
5678,Then there will be the federal vaccine priority list which will be different than the state list.
5679,Then the vaccine will only go to the federal and the locals won't get any.
5680,Then it will take two weeks to set up  a federal clinic.
5681,"Get rid of regulations,  Give me a notification that that vaccine will be here in 48 hours and I will have a safe efficient distribution Operation that will cost nothing,  run 24/7,  give the vaccine to everyone and not waste a drop."
5682,Ask me how.

5715,What's wrong with my personal freedom?
5716,I've lived mostly normally since June last year.
5717,Since then only 3 days of lockdown.
5718,My person freedom is going great and none of my colleagues/friends/family are dead either so I'd say that's a bonus.
5719,"I put on a mask for other people, scan a QR code when I go places and use have sanitizer."
5720,Other than that life is normal.
5721,I even got to watch sport live on the weekend in a stadium.
5722,"People have been distancing pretty well here the whole time, well at least from what I have seen."
5723,~2.5 months on (in isolation!)
5724,for ~2 weeks off is borderline inhumane though.

5733,Island has sweet fuck all to do with it.
5734,Hawaii alone is worse than New Zealand.
5735,That's about as far from fucking anyone that any island can possibly get.
5736,It's literally in the centre of the damn-near entire half of the planet that's entirely water.

5753,No we made it to 13 days last streak mate.

5773,I live in Massachusetts where everyone is following the rules.
5774,For example people outside alone for a walk are wearing masks.
5775,Yet we have high numbers of cases.
5776,It seems that there really is no way to control it but we should at least try our best.
5777,"And that’s the problem with Florida, not wearing a mask is simply being a selfish individual."
5778,"I should say, Australians when polled overwhelmingly do not trust government."
5779,But the last part of your post sums it up.
5780,"Australians love a whinge, and think politicians are paid too much."
5781,"However when it comes to taking action, Australians are incredibly apathetic."
5782,"Not many Australians would be willing to even publicly protest, lest take up arms against a government to protest the measures implemented."
5783,"However as you said, Americans (and honestly many people from many other western countries) would take strong action."
5784,"I know a lot of Aussies that thought the measures were stupid, social distancing signs everywhere were dumb, having to check into places was pointless, were pissed off they couldn't travel interstate at times, thought officials were overreacting when sending hotspots into lockdowns."
5785,"But that is literally all it was, fleeting thoughts."
5786,A few seconds of whinging followed by acceptance and getting on with things.
5787,That isn't to say there are no U.S states or western countries where people have similar views to Aussies.
5788,"But in all cases, those locations are surrounded by other states, countries or locations that do not, making the situation all the more difficult."

5793,Howard Springs is half an hour drive from Darwin so the quarantine workers (backpackers) live in Darwin.
5794,But the outdoor set-up (and fact that they don’t clean the rooms for days after they’re vacated) means transmission to other guests or workers would Be difficult.
5795,You'll find the people who say it's too late to find evidence never seem to know how these kind of investigations actually work.
5796,I've never seen this argument backed up by any kind of real insight.

5814,Almost like normal now here in Australia.
5815,Only thing missing is big events like concerts and overseas travel.
5816,What you’re seeing right now is people telling other people to get a low efficacy shot and then be ok with getting covid when we’ve been told for the last year to not get covid.
5817,"If it’s ok to get “mild covid”, then it should have been ok for the under 65 and healthy to get mild covid over the last year because they are already at low risk for hospitalization."
5818,I haven’t seen any evidence that the low efficacy vaccines protect people with mild infections from becoming long haulers.
5819,It’s better to not get covid at all... as has always been the case.

5826,Go fuck off and send your kid there if you want because public schools aren’t equipped to handle covid.
5827,That's a good point.
5828,But not the test I'm referring to.
5829,Not related to travel at all.
5830,None of those states made it ok to intentionally just run people over.

5852,Australia has the most urbanised population in the world.
5853,90% of Australians live within 100 kms of the coast.
5854,71% of Australians live in major cities (major city = population over 100 000).
5855,Australia is huge in land mass - but we all huddle close to the coast in cities.
5856,This post didn't age well
5857,&gt;This complex system has given rise to a new type of pandemic travel – dubbed “vaccine tourism” – in which people cross state or even country lines to get earlier access.
5858,"And all of those resources that are vehicles for delivering doses of the vaccine are tied to a local community, state, or city in terms of allocation,” said Dr Kyle Ferguson, a postdoctoral fellow in the division of medical ethics at the New York University Grossman School of Medicine."
5859,Cities and states generally receive batches of the vaccine from the federal government based on the adult population in the area and plan their distribution strategy accordingly.

5925,Many borders with neighbouring states.
5926,"Vastly different approaches to tackling the virus spread, implementing controls, and general compliance with mandates issued."
5927,Name an Australian state that doesn't have strict lockdown protocols in place.
5928,Now imagine if a few of them didn't.
5929,"Pretend for a moment Victoria is full of ""freedom loving"" know it alls who would never let their government impose strict restrictions on them."
5930,"Now imagine the borders are much more widely travelled, and population clusters are everywhere."
5931,That is part of the situation for similar wealthy regions like the U.S and/or Europe.
5932,However it is even worse than that.
5933,One last thing - Australias covid response if it COULD be implemented in those other places would have worked very well.
5934,I am not giving you reasons on why the measures would not work.
5935,I am giving you an explanation on why they would not be implemented.
5936,"I don't think any politician could ever get 50 states to agree to strict lockdowns, and even if they did, they would never convince people to follow the same level of compliance with government order as Australia has."
5937,Definitely a conservative troll.

5940,My theory around schools is that the teachers simply don’t want to have to wear a mask all day.
5941,My daughter is in a private school that’s remained open the entire time and there hasn’t been a single case of a teacher getting covid or a breakout in a class.

5950,The mRNA is actually software development for a biological machine.
5951,"Unfortunately, this biological machine is vastly more complex and nuanced than a man-made CPU, so much of the fundamental understanding is still subject to empirical experience and heuristical generalizations."
5952,"Focusing on one lipid carrier and one kind of injection is apparently already a good step, as apparently much depends on *where* the mRNA gets translated."
5953,"But I currently do not see how we can get to the point where a new mRNA code is approved within weeks, which would be necessary to unlock the *real* potential of the technique."

5960,Apparently there are a few disused camps that can be repurposed.
5961,These mining camps even have their own airports if they need to translate a sick person to a hospital.
5962,This is basically the big one.
5963,Americans do not trust their federal government anywhere near as much as Australians do.
5964,"Also 'liberty' is held in much higher regard in the US, to the point where it seems completely nonsensical to outsiders (Eg Some US gun laws)."
5965,"I'd say there is broad support for the current covid restrictions in Australia, which include measures such as you are unable to leave the country unless granted a permit, hotel quarantines meaning you will have great difficulty returning to the country, state border closures banning most travel between states, and lockdowns - with sometimes *very* stringent rules (for a few days in South Australia you were not allowed to even take your dog for a walk!)."

5984,It is partly supply.
5985,Canada had contracts with some companies and those companies failed to make good on their contracts and diverted shipments to the US instead because they aren't able to fulfill their contracts entirely due to issues.
5986,nothing points to that and whats the point if time span is too great between 2nd booster and the likely 3rd booster.
5987,ItsCYA time

6000,"I think the one-year mark of this bullshit will make a lot of people go ""fuck it"", and by late-May, I think that hospitalizations will be low enough that very few people will be following guidelines."

6002,Daniel Griffin on twiv podcast is claiming that with good syringes he can extract upto 13 doses from every 10 dose vial from the 10 dose moderna vial.
6003,The government should do everything in their power to increase availability of these syringes.
6004,US could easily vaccinate 200 million people by early May.
6005,But this requires competence in all sectors.
6006,"Yeah but that other guy was like ""we had 1.6 on inauguration day"" but neglected to mention that that was because of unreported vaccines from MLK day and the 19th and not because we actually vaccinated 1.6 million on the 20th."
6007,"The ""Biden effect"", if any, will be felt at a later stage."
6008,Isn’t that almost 1% of the country?
6009,Credit where it’s due.
6010,lol eu so pissed right now
6011,"Most people on this sub stopped making any sense after the vaccines have arrived, they don't want to acknowledge the logistics and geopolitical facts about what should be an effort for a global vaccination."
6012,"Most people on this sub now are trapped in a mindset of first world vaccine nacionalism, like they think they would be 100% free of the virus after letting the borders go open to the rest of the world after all THEIR population have been vaccinated, but the poor countries not."
6013,I'm pretty confident about all the things scheduled for September 2021 and later in the US.
6014,I have tickets for an outdoor concert in July that seems quite on the bubble right now.
6015,"If I am vaccinated at least a few weeks earlier and the city allows tens of thousands of people to congregate for it, I will probably go while donning a KF94 mask."
6016,It seems like the USA will have sufficient supply to vaccinate everybody who wants it by mid summer.
6017,The remaining thing that we still haven't really proven is how much we can ramp up administering the shots.
6018,I think we will do it.
6019,"The virus variants are a wrinkle, but once I get a vaccinated I just can't see myself treating this differently than the flu regardless of that."
6020,"💉 💪

6022,It's not really increasing their capacity by 9M doses so much as reducing the shortfall from 49M to 40M.

6031,meanwhile rest of Europe isn't getting much vaccinations..
6032,[deleted]
6033,We have.
6034,The problem is that companies have been diverting shipments to the US in particular (both Moderna and Pfizer) and other vaccines ordered are still waiting on final approval.
6035,The US and UK have a lot more weight to throw around so they get those contracts actually enforced.
6036,"Also important to mention their case and death rates are far worse than Canada's, so arguably they SHOULD get vaccines first anyway because the situation is so much worse there."
6037,It’s up there with “No one is rich until everyone is rich.”
6038,Is this the selfish Brits who licensed the vaccine to all for free?
6039,Is this the selfish Brits who insisted the vaccine be sold at cost price?
6040,Ass to mouth for the best accuracy?
6041,I heard some seek out this genre of film media.

6043,Talking about western vaccines of course.
6044,"But go ahead, vaccine yourself with the Chinese vaccine."
6045,"It’s a fact that the US has an Executive Order in place that bans the export of vaccine and vaccine related products, get your facts straight."
6046,As for the UK it has a defacto ban in place as it has reserved all doses for itself until their entire order is filled.
6047,"Haha that’s funny as shit, but I get it."

6050,"Biden should defer these folks meet with Schumer, Biden doesn;t boss Schumer,"
6051,I dont know
6052,Personally as a nurse listening to some pod cast from doctors in Australia ...I feel they grasped quickly that this was inflammatory issue requiring steroids and they recognized early that the use antiviral redemivir would be helpful in certain cases.....plus been impressed with there understanding of post covid symptoms &amp; how to treat some of that as well so kudos to Australia for staying on top of it ...USA not impressed with my country's handling of Covid &amp; still seeing lack of understanding of post covid symptoms.
6053,"In addition  very concerned with the fact that patient that present with ""silent Hypoxemia still being missed which increases pt mortality risk."
6054,&gt; Does that bother you at all?
6055,Not in the slightest.
6056,"&gt; I mean I’d honestly be kind of... bothered if I’m social distancing in my country because another country is unvaccinated

Have you seen how fast these ""variants"" are traveling?"
6057,Some of them are worse than the original.
6058,&gt;God forbid anyone read the article.
6059,"You are joking, right?"
6060,"If AZ can just increase their capacity by 9M doses per quarter, then why did they not a) do that weeks ago and b) not scale up by even more than that?"
6061,We have two months left in this quarter.
6062,"This increase would mean about 1M doses per week, if they start the new capacity *now*."
6063,"But of they could do *that*, they could setup another 1M per week by mid-February and so on and so forth."
6064,Finished by April???
6065,Heh.
6066,Canada won’t have 2 million doses of vaccines total by then.
6067,I mean unless you are talking about Jesus coming out to save the day.
6068,Freedom of security too!
6069,Who are they gonna infect during a nor'easter?
6070,Their cats?
6071,I feel like people who have played X-Com know this very well!
6072,"Sharpshooter with a 95% shot, miss, squad is destroyed next turn."
6073,I'm just saying that for now Biden being in office has had virtually no impact on the pace of the increase of the rolling average.
6074,It has kept increasing just as fast as it did before.
6075,Hopefully the administration has something in their sleeve to increase the pace even further.
6076,Then they need to distribute at least 2.5mn doses per day and so far they are not hitting those numbers.

6084,"Canada,  wtf."
6085,We're an embarrassment.
6086,"&gt; Just a hypothetical scenario: AZ-UK contract stipulates the delivery of 20M doses in Q1, factories can make 30M."
6087,"Then, according to the pov of the EU, AZ should deliver 10M doses to the EU."
6088,"When this should happen (after the UK orders or in parallel), is difficult to assess, as people on both sides are literally dying."
6089,"In this scenario, I think most people (including Brits) would agree with the 10k surplus doses being diverted to the EU."
6090,But there’s not much point contemplating it at the moment because there *isn’t* a surplus and probably won’t be for quite some time.
6091,The British general public would never forgive their government if they donated much-needed vaccines to a rich and developed institution like the EU while still in a strict lockdown and averaging over 1000 deaths a day.
6092,"&gt;Similarly, assume the UK is to receive 20M doses of BionTech, got 18M and applied them as first dose."
6093,"Germany got 10M doses applied 5 as first dose, keeping the rest in storage.Now the production drops massively for a few weeks."
6094,BionTech can produce 15M doses.
6095,Should that all go to the UK because of the second dose factor?
6096,"I don't think so, but it's not a completely ridiculous argument, either."
6097,"No, in that scenario, of course I wouldn’t say UK should get all the doses."
6098,"But again, it is a wholly unrealistic scenario because the British government wouldn’t carry on giving first doses of Pfizer vaccine without a steady incoming supply of second doses."
6099,"And it takes weeks to brew the vaccines, so the pharmaceutical companies would know quite a way in advance whether they can meet the demand in time, and warn the recipients if not."
6100,Pretty much most of Australia has been close to back to normal since early 2020.
6101,Just saying.
6102,[removed]
6103,"Whether they are stupid or not for thinking that, it is still terrible messaging if they want people to take the vaccine."

6112,I'm sure they have under counting some deaths but with a population this young it's not a huge surprise that it may be wide spread but with far fewer deaths.

6115,Most definitely.

6152,That would probably be the trigger for people in Europe to rise up and overthrow the EU.
6153,"&gt;It should of course store other things such as health status, record where you have been and political affiliations."
6154,None of those are relevant to a vaccination database.
6155,"It *might* make sense to have a separate ""where you have been"" database for people who tested positive, for contact tracing purposes."
6156,But not for people who got the vaccine

6172,"That doesn't sound plausible, specially after they claimed they are delivering 2 million vaccines per week to the UK."

6229,"Go on, show this data."
6230,"You keep touting Florida as an example, but you do realize that their numbers are still really high, right?"
6231,Florida's cases/deaths per capita aren't actually good.
6232,"Meanwhile, tell me how Florida's recovery is going compared to China's or even NZ and Australia."
6233,&gt;Yes some measures should be taken to protect the old and susceptible but closing society on a whole is insane.
6234,Why?
6235,That clearly prevents a loss of life.
6236,I think it's the most sane thing to sacrifice some freedoms for a short period for far more long term gain.
6237,I think it's insane to refuse to wear masks.
6238,I think it's insane that one cannot keep their gatherings to a small group for a couple of months.
6239,I think it's insane to want to host large parties in the middle of a pandemic.
6240,"I think it's insane people, if applicable, cannot adapt to work or study from home."
6241,&gt; I'm talking about countries that already have been in lockdown for a year and are really suffering do to it.
6242,"Yeah, if only you had a co-ordinated nationwide lockdown for 1-2 months like the successful countries rather than haphazard lockdowns lacking in any co-ordination to actually work."
6243,&gt;Coronavirus is already there and there is no stopping it.
6244,So lift restrictions because they are doing more harm than good.
6245,Like Sweden?
6246,They still have restrictions via social distancing and WFH recommendations.
6247,Many other countries also have them via mask mandates.
6248,"They don't prevent people from working, so why the opposition to them?"
6249,"&gt;Australia cut itself off from the world

So did the US."
6250,Go research on how non-essential land travel in/out of the US was banned.
6251,Go research on how international air travel was restricted to only US residents and a very select few countries.
6252,"The US visa office was closed, do you actually understand how difficult it was for an international traveler to enter the US?"
6253,"Seriously, want to tell me how that didn't effectively construe the US cutting itself off from the world when you barred travel from the hotspots early on?"
6254,"&gt;Also, i don't buy into these death stats."
6255,You shouldn't.
6256,Excess deaths shows that COVID deaths are underreported globally.
6257,That's actual data - what do you have?
6258,"I got developed covid after receiving my first vaccine but I am 99% sure I already had covid, also my colleague who received her first dose of the vaccine a few weeks before I did developed covid at the same time."
6259,It’s not completely protective with one dose but it has benefits of course.
6260,"There's a good chance that simply by preventing symptoms, the vaccine makes people significantly less contagious."
6261,In addition to that it probably reduces the viral load of people who carry the virus.
6262,But we've spent the last year promoting the idea that asymptomatic carriers are just as contagious as symptomatic carriers.
6263,It's hard to backpedal on that.
6264,I’m in Zürich and we can’t even register to get vaccinated yet.
6265,Whereas my freaking neighbors just rented a full-on bus so they could go gambling with 40 of their favorite friends.
6266,Didn't see a single mask.
6267,smh
6268,"Yeah, because a significant number of their staff were infected."
6269,Do you think they could be safely opened?
6270,But but Sweden bad!
6271,/s
6272,*laughs in Panic Buying Perth*
6273,"Is it possible that hospital staff are still getting infected at the same rate, but not showing symptoms?"
6274,Just trying to play devils advocate re sterilizing immunity.
6275,I had a cold in the summer.
6276,I just wanna say this for anyone who's worried about reports of a couple days of feeling unwell with the Covid vaccine.
6277,"When I had the virus in early November, I felt like absolute shit for a full two weeks."
6278,And I'm not fully better now.
6279,I can't smell anything more than a couple feet away.
6280,Mint smells and tastes like garbage water.
6281,I still have muscle aches as well as less energy and less lung capacity than I did before getting sick.
6282,And I'm a mid-20s person without any known pre-existing conditions.
6283,"You don't want this disease, nor the guilt of wondering if you spread it to others."
6284,The allergic reactions have been minor and treatable on site.
6285,"As for the other side effects, I'd absolutely have taken a couple days of being bedridden over what I went through and to some extent am still dealing with now."
6286,Which is why I wrote territory.
6287,Texas is still smaller than most states.
6288,"Come to that, Texas is also smaller than the Northern Territory."
6289,Whatever.
6290,Vaccinate the two thirds who want it then.
6291,This should have been forced by the governments half a year ago.

6297,"This is how it worked for countries that went into lockdown, or did you assume it was somehow different?"

6311,"I lost it two years ago, when it came back it was different but not bad."
6312,Good luck telling the people that.
6313,We’ve been going from “flatten the curve” to “wait for a vaccine or treatment to reduce deaths and hospitalization” to “wait for a highly effective treatment to eliminate the virus”.
6314,It’s insane.
6315,I understand a dynamic situation requires dynamic goals but by summer we will have archived everything that is possible and apparently even that wont bring us back our normal lives.
6316,So what’s next?
6317,Vaccinate all living organism on earth?
6318,They’ve already suggested pets will have to be vaccinated.

6328,But the fact that they spent weeks siding with Clive stands for a lot.
6329,"dude we always need a flaming guitar, even during the best of times."
6330,It’s inevitable that schools are going to reopen for a month and most likely close for a extended spring break for 3-4 weeks by Mid March as cases shoot back up.
6331,All this is just propaganda and repeating the same fucking insanity we went through last year.
6332,"Israel will have those stats, probably before it matters to the speed of vaccine use in USA."

6337,"&gt; would you say Australia is a shining example to other countries with less money and higher population density

I think there are lessons to be learnt and data to be collected everywhere, especially where victories have been had."
6338,"That said, it's always incorrect to suggest ""just do what X country did""."
6339,It's too simple an answer for complex topics such as COVID.
6340,"&gt; You say highly urbanised, but even Sidney has a population density that can be compared to a French village."
6341,I can't find a capital that has a smaller population density than Canberra (444/km2).
6342,"Partially because Australian cities are geographically large, but mainly because Australian cities are measured differently from most of the rest of the world."
6343,"The Local Government Areas in central Sydney have population densities of 3,000/km^2 to 8,000+/km^(2),  and this region is a much closer analogue to how other global cities' population densities are typically measured."
6344,"For comparison, the figure you probably saw for Sydney (~420/km^(2)) is for its metropolitan area."

6355,Do we know the efficacy of the Oxford vaccine stratified by age?
6356,Any place to access that information?
6357,Even if no one gets the vaccine this will not go on indefinitely.
6358,There have been many pandemics in human history and they all end even without vaccines.

6376,Depends on where your boundaries of cities end.
6377,The CBD and inner Melbourne would be denser than almost anywhere in London as London does not have that many resedential skyscrapers.

6424,ENSEMBLE 2 will likely be a few months away.
6425,They started after ENSEMBLE 1 and their protocol calls for the second shot to be administered 57 days after the first shot.
6426,Their primary end point is based on post 14 days after the second shot where as ENSEMBLE 1 was based on post 28 days after the first shot.
6427,"This adds about 6 weeks and given they started later, i would not expect results until late March or April."

6430,I think knowing facts about transmission after the shot would go a long way
6431,"The effectiveness of antibodies can be reduced, but likely not by a lot, because the spike is the virus' key to unlock the cell, if it mutated to the point of escaping antibodies entirely, it would also lose its ability to enter a cell, like a key too deformed to fit the lock."
6432,There is a limit on how much antibodies can lose effectiveness before the mutated virus is no longer a concern.
6433,"This probably happened a lot, we just don't see it because those viruses mutated themselves into extinction."
6434,"The last variant that was shown to have an effect on antibody performance was the ""mink mutation,"" reduced antibody effectiveness by about 15%, scientists have said it's not a problem for vaccines."
6435,"Even if the vaccines lose some effectiveness, they will just be slower to bring case numbers down, they should still be very effective at preventing hospitalization and deaths."
6436,[removed]
6437,Probably because Finland has a population that’s like 30% of Greater London’s.
6438,It’s a lot easier to prevent transmission of a vaccine when you have only 5 million people living in an area the size of Finland.
6439,Even the cities aren’t densely populated compared to other bigger European countries so it’s just easier to manage.
6440,&gt;Everyone keeps saying lockdowns both work and is the ONLY measurement in place to stop the spread of the coronavirus.
6441,"I don t agree, neither **everyone** nor **ONLY**."

6443,Sweden has found its own way and done much better than some seem to believe.
6444,I think your contribution is helpful in showing that.
6445,"It's not very convincing as an argument against ""lockdowns""."
6446,I'm the opposite.

6520,"In fact, if you look at the source that you've given in log space then you can pretty much approximate the vaccination rate as a linear line."

6541,I hope Zoomers and millennials rise up and realize they’re being fucked.
6542,"Once you have cases, being remote makes no difference."
6543,Especially since vaccine exports are not actually blocked from the EU.
6544,"Basically EU wants to make sure they're not getting conned, so they monitor exports."
6545,"Thanks, I should have done the quote myself."
6546,And it's important to note that the first four are largely because of the beginning of the outbreak when we didn't have all the medical response and medicines we have now to prevent fatal outcomes.
6547,Mississippi and South Dakota have progressed this far negatively on their own accord despite improvements in medical capabilities over the past year.
6548,"early March:

6549,This is truly sad.
6550,Most of these guys/gals did not even get to see their loved ones for the last time.
6551,Yeah.
6552,True and unnecessary to this discussion.
6553,"I just explained why they were probably downvoted, that's all."
6554,Is that near Pittsburgh?
6555,Shots going in arms is not a bad idea
6556,"This suggests 10,000 were done in one day (yesterday) though."
6557,"Don’t get me wrong, I think its good if it means less 2nd doses to get through later, just wonder if its unfair if some people are still getting it and therefore don’t have to have it hanging over them."
6558,"Production is ramping up, and the NHS is getting better at getting vaccinations done."
6559,"As long as there aren't supply problems, you can expect vaccinations to keep getting faster (of course, there will still be a lot of day-to-day variation)."
6560,Assuming by the question you're posing that you don't believe in a mask mandate.
6561,Correct me if I'm wrong.
6562,"If you don't agree with a mask mandate, why not?"
6563,Doesn't seem to be a big inconvenience for me and it's preventing people from dying is why I support a mask mandate.
6564,That shows nothing.
6565,It shows Covid is hard to track.
6566,Now you want the nature article that shows closing schools brings R down .2 to .4?
6567,That's all that matters R. That's it.
6568,\*Cries in Canadian\*
6569,No one is safe until everyone is safe
6570,It is being produced at cost in India.
6571,The prices may be different because the vaccines costs more to produce in India.
6572,The start-up costs would be very high given how aggressive SII in setting up production along with materials for the vaccine being more expensive.
6573,And $5 a dose is cheaper than any other vaccine.
6574,Come on down to NC!
6575,"You aren’t going to make what you would as a software engineer (probably why many software engineers don’t quit their jobs to teach), but it shouldn’t be too hard to do a lateral entry!"

6577,I can actually point you in the direction of an open math position if you’d like more information!
6578,"Very sad news, I hope he pulls through."
6579,His laps to raise funds for healthcare were legendary ... it was big news here in the US.
6580,The Sinovac vaccine they use isn’t proven for the elderly.
6581,But he's pointing out the utterly awful job the EU has done which is perfectly true
6582,Wash your hands
6583,He's extremely well respected and has been right on this pandemic in particular.
6584,He gets interviewed because he is credible.
6585,I think there is.

6587,They spread like crazy.
6588,Stop spread and we slow shit way down.
6589,"It’s easier for elderly people to quarantine, they’ve retired and don’t have to work for the most part."
6590,The public health profession will absolutely not recover in our lifetime.
6591,In many states they've already had power stripped away and things aren't even done yet.
6592,And the next decade of economic depression will be accurately blamed on them.

6599,There study design estimated efficiancy data at beginning of march.
6600,Compared to the other vaccines the approval by EMA shouldnt take longer than a few weeks.
6601,I expected them in April or May.
6602,You missed the joke
6603,No one is safe until everyone is safe.

6614,"As a Brit, I agree with you."
6615,My grandparents (aged in their 80s) were amongst the first to get the Pfizer vaccine in mid December.
6616,Boris announced in early January that second doses would be delayed but my grandparents’ appointments went ahead as planned on 7th January.
6617,"Apparently, the hospital cancelled all second doses booked the following week."
6618,So I guess there is a small pocket of people who got their second doses of Pfizer very early on.
6619,The delays have been pretty much fixed now.
6620,The Oxford vaccine is being made in 12 countries across the world and the supply will only increase as the producers get used to the technology.
6621,It really isn't hard maths.
6622,"When the Oxford vaccine is so much cheaper, easier to distribute and very similar efficacy, more countries will go with that."
6623,"And by producing at cost and teaming up with the biggest vaccine manufacturer in the world, it's clear the Oxford vaccine will be produced the most"
6624,"&gt;The nba forbid their superstars from getting the vaccine

This statement is not true."
6625,The NBA forbid them from cutting the line.
6626,"If a player is elgible to receive the vaccine, they can get it."
6627,"You must have missed this, but this stems from the PR issues they had back in March with players getting a bunch of COVID tests done when COVID tests were in short supply."
6628,"Man I wish the ""we're all in this together"" attitude extended to those of us stuck overseas."
6629,It hasn’t been proved they can’t spread it to others.
6630,So I wouldn’t have her go maskless until the others in the household are vaccinated.
6631,Lmao.
6632,Pathetic.
6633,No thanks.
6634,I'm still 2 weeks to flatten the curve here

6636,In certain parts of the country that are still calling COVID a hoax...it probably won't end there.
6637,It seems like we should still keep the goal of widely preventing severe disease and keeping the hospitals open.
6638,"First doses only would do that, right?"
6639,Religion makes people stupid.
6640,That is a conservative estimate.
6641,"I expect everything to be gone by July, except maybe masks and a couple of other restrictions in hospitals, care homes, and airplanes."
6642,Not even.
6643,"This is actually the freaking BARDA plan to deal with mass vaccinations in an emergency that they discarded, for some insane reason."
6644,Sarcasm is a lost art
6645,It will end.
6646,China has some good news for you in that case.
6647,🤣🤣🤣
6648,"If the vaccines work really good against B117 (UK) and just ok against B1351 (South Africa), I hope the UK one outcompetes the other one in the diminishing unvaccinated populations and we all come out ok."
6649,they are sooooo lucky that right now only affluent and middle-class seniors who're tech-savvy are able to secure spots at Dodger Stadium.
6650,"If this line were filled with actual Dodger fans (beer-drinking Latino bros), shots would've been fired and all these protesters would've had their heads bashed in."
6651,It's all fun &amp; games when you're picking on elderly who're afraid to fight back.
6652,But you just try to pull this ish in June when dose are available to under-65 general public and we'll see how these protesters fare against cholos and cholas.
6653,I honestly don't care.
6654,Those crazies temporarily shut down a vaccination center.
6655,"They ain't doing that with troops there, and they know it."
6656,And just like that everything falls down the drain lol... good luck being locked down for the next few years if you keep this strategy...
6657,"The politicization was fueled by the media, NPR, NYT, all the liberal outlets gave me the impression that experts were certain this came from wild animals."
6658,"I tend to trust the experts, but sometimes the experts are wrong, or the wrong ones happened to get interviews."
6659,The fact that Australia happens to have a huge empty desert has *nothing* to do with covid transmission.
6660,The majority of Australians live in one of about 8 cities.
6661,Sydney alone has the population of *Scotland*.
6662,Exactly what I was thinking lol
6663,"Yes but once things get bad enough, fear will bring people back indoors."

6668,"Like I said, you can just keep on steaming towards those icebergs."
6669,Luck might be enough to make it through without any changes.
6670,"But it isn't a very responsible approach to not explore what options exist that don't impose too much on people, and employees and customers may feel they have a decent legal liability case against their employer if nothing was done, not even the easy things, and it all goes horribly wrong."
6671,Or the investors and creditors.
6672,I guess it depends on how much people feel like gambling.
6673,I got the Pfizer shot (in Arizona ) &amp; it was a breeze - super skinny needle compared to what I used to give myself b12 shots in the thigh with.
6674,I’ll bet you could train someone to just give the shot in a few hours.
6675,"Besides, the people watching over you for the next 15 minutes were volunteers, not medical."
6676,I’m sure there were medical personnel available for the volunteers to consult with as needed.
6677,Except it’s not 100% true.
6678,Perth just entered lockdown and started a mask mandate over 1 case.
6679,"Yes, 1 case."
6680,Do you want that to happen in the US and the EU?
6681,Zero COVID is a garbage strategy that should only be done in the far future after the pandemic and restrictions become a distant memory.
6682,"A question about Vaccines : not a conspiracy theory, just my inner musings while doing housework."
6683,I’m Uk based.
6684,We’ve done terribly.
6685,100k deaths etc.
6686,Something strikes me as strange though - the government has really tightened its approach to lockdown.
6687,"First time round and in the months that followed, we (they) were always taking about getting the economy going."
6688,Opening the tap etc.
6689,This time around - we might talk about schools March 8th but not much else.
6690,It seems to me it’s either the 100k milestone or the vaccines arrival has suddenly got them taking it more seriously.
6691,Which got me thinking.
6692,"The AZ vaccine (I believe) should have been ready for trials September, but there was a delay as they were lacking in volunteers."
6693,The first lockdown had been too effective.
6694,"Is / was it the case that the government / scientists / Illuminati (joke) new the only real way out of this was with a vaccine and the only way to achieve this was to invest heavily in it, and make sure we have enough victims, sorry volunteers to fully run the trials?"
6695,"If we had taken the NZ approach, would the same vaccine progress have been possible?"
6696,Or am I over simplifying things and it doesn’t work like that?
6697,"I'm not sure how that is related, say they don't have the money, you put them in jail if they don't pay, trust me they will gather the money from the people, that is one thing cults are great at is taking resources from the lower members."
6698,"Say they have the money, at least it hurts them and gives money to the state to fight the corona, if they repeat the offence, get more and put them in prison."
6699,"The police literally said they didn't do anything ""to avoid violence"", they're being pussies."

6707,So they should or should not have taken prisoners at all?
6708,I'm always amazed at how redditors seem to have very simple answers for extremely complex situations.

6710,Stupid question.

6712,I got hate for going to see parents even though they knew risks and wanted me to come anyway you can’t logic these people
6713,cries in Canada.. but good for them
6714, The british variant seems to be a differetn beast that is really hard to contain with the measures that work for the original variant.
6715,I compiled theese numbers from Denmark.
6716,"**B117 numbers in Denmark**

In  Denmark most of the positive tests is sequenced, combined with a high  test rate (almost 2% of population per day) and low positivity rate  (&lt;1%) the numbers from Denmark are perhaps the most accurate out  there."
6717,"The lockdown are bringing  down the infections R(0) = 0,7 but beneath that the British variant are  growing and from week 3 make up 13% of cases."
6718,From medio Februar the  British variant will be dominating and driving the numbers.
6719,"It seems  that B117 is growing around 60% per week even with the current  lockdown..

**Current lockdown measures** (from medio December):

* All schools are closed."
6720,"* People who are able to, work from home."
6721,* Only shops that are open are food related and health related.
6722,* Restaurants: take away only.
6723,* Mask mandated in public transportation and indoor public spaces.
6724,* No gatherings of more than 5 people.

6735,You're right it is their choice but if necessary lockdowns close the main places that these narcissists want to go like bars and restaurants without giving a shit about spreading the virus than their selfish choices can only do so much harm.
6736,"That's the point of lockdowns, protecting the good ppl from the narcissistic assholes who can't possibly live without their wants and don't care about peoples parents and grandparents dying."
6737,The leading torah scholar (who is 93) got corona in the fall and lived (he didn't even become seriously ill).

6773,"The issue with most of the things that the WHO says/suggests is that it/they don't even consider for a moment, what the government is supposed to say to their tax payers and voters when it comes to implementing/executing these ""suggestions"" and ""demands""."
6774,"Sure it makes logical sense, to consider pausing vaccinations for the less risk groups ""to help vulnerable people worldwide"" but that logic doesn't address what happens, when even one of the people in the ""less risk groups"" gets sick, much less dies because their country put other people ahead of their citizens."
6775,"The WHO can keep saying things like this, which totally ignore the realities that the UK and other so called ""rich"" nations face, which would result in them sending their citizens and tax payers money and resources to people who are neither."
6776,"To do what the WHO wants/demands is a lose/lose scenario for the UK and other ""rich"" countires, the only winners would be those citizens/nations who are fortunate enough to be on the receiving end of this deal."
6777,"In the end, vaccinations need to be made available to pretty much everyone, because this is probably the only way to try to get this under control."
6778,"But it's way too big of an ask, when it comes to asking the UK or other nations to potentially kill their citizens to help/save/protect others."
6779,I pretty much end up feeling like this every time the WHO makes an announcement like this.
6780,"I guess that they may feel that they have to or have no choice, but it's still pisses me off every time I see/read/hear one of these kind of statements being made by the WHO."
6781,"A nation is pretty much required to take care of their own, before looking to help/take care of others, if they don't then they will not be able to stay in power, unless the nation isn't a democratic or representative type of gov't."

6791,My upvote counts for something.
6792,&gt;You don't deal with a public health crisis today by talking about crap that occurred hundreds of years ago and has no relevance to rational vaccine distribution today.
6793,Generational poverty caused by the US forcing natives to migrate across the country to land they weren't familiar with and had very few natural resources... yeah there's no way that impacts public health!
6794,Except the  healthcare system in the US being **completely** tied to how much money you have
6795,Let’s put this in perspective.
6796,We can’t expect everything to be totally normal during a pandemic.
6797,But Australia is doing a whole lot better than most of the world right now.
6798,What people are wining about is inconvenience vs deaths + the massive economic hit that comes from when there are so many deaths nobody goes out and travels and spends money anyways
6799,Oh yeah February 2020 where the virus was already in the United States but people lived life like normal good times

6816,"If you were only putting yourself in danger that would be one thing, but every person who isn’t vaccinated is just another chance for the virus to mutate and spread."
6817,Don’t skip the vaccine.
6818,&gt;  Thats not possible for the majority of countries.
6819,"If China can do it in Shanghai and Beijing, that excuse just goes out the window."
6820,&gt;When their numbers are similar to states that had lockdowns it really makes me question the efficacy of lockdowns.
6821,Lockdowns aren't going to be effective if they aren't properly enforced or if states don't co-ordinate it properly.
6822,No point having a lockdown if you're just going to allow to travel from states that haven't enforced one without any kind of screening.
6823,"Also, you might want to look at NYC's or even Florida's numbers after they achieved numbers."
6824,"Lockdowns do work, but long term suppression relies on people following the measures along with active isolating and contact tracing."
6825,"&gt;Of course not all states are affected equally, but what evidence says that it was because there was no lockdown?"
6826,Extra deaths?
6827,Look at the aforementioned countries.
6828,Mental health issues?
6829,Tell that to the citizens of those countries who have to deal with much looser restrictions without the threat of a pandemic.
6830,Job loss?
6831,Those countries are also recovering faster.
6832,&gt;it seems obivous they are doing more harm than good.
6833,26k dead in Florida alone.
6834,Australia has a bigger population with 909 people dead.
6835,"Most of those vacationers would be outside, though, and if they were infected, they’d be taking it back with them where it would be counted in their own state."
6836,"Lockdowns work just fine if they are rapid response, cohesively upheld, short term, and targeted."
6837,"Since the US did none of that and still had international and intranational travel going on mostly unrestricted, ours were never going to work as well as they could have."
6838,Good.
6839,"While vaccinated, you:

* Can get infected by SARS-CoV-2."
6840,* Can spread SARS-CoV-2.
6841,* Are protected from SARS-CoV-2 creating COVID-19 in you (provided that the vaccine is effective for you).
6842,"I think you’re conflating Novavax with OX/AZ and J&amp;J.  

Novavax is not a DNA vector vaccine, it’s a protein subunit vaccine (so also different than Moderna &amp; Pfizer)."
6843,The Novavax vaccine gives you a nano particle studded with an array of the spike proteins mounted on the outside &amp; enhanced by an immune boosting adjuvant.

6850,Australians are allowed to return and are allowed to leave.
6851,It's just harder than it was pre Covid.
6852,Who has been moving the goalposts?
6853,"Politicians, or scientists?"
6854,"I'm pretty sure public health experts have been pretty firm that while limiting deaths is priority number 1, the ""end"" of the pandemic will be a long tail"
6855,No it won’t.

6857,I test people at the hospital.
6858,"When pressed, we don't want to change it because we are forced to settle for mediocrity."
6859,Because we aren't given options for anything that is actually good.

6861,Have you ever taught?
6862,"Perhaps you taught someplace with an authoritarian vibe and the students had been conditioned since youth to obey, but I lolled when I read “students are much more compliant”."
6863,"I used to teach high school, and weirdly compliant teens was not my experience."
6864,Incredibly imaginative in their rule breaking would be a more accurate description in my opinion.
6865,"But back to the CDCs opinion piece on schools, you should go read it, read the studies they based their recommendation of reopening schools upon and ask yourself if they show students are indeed “safe”, or if they found a justification by saying students are safer in school where some people are at least trying to follow safety protocols, vs being in community settings where people have decided to ignore the virus"
6866,They are very used to mask wearing over there.
6867,"It’s a very clean city, to the point where it’s illegal to spit in public."
6868,"In comparison, NYC is a filthy garbage dump."
6869,"Tokyo had less cases because of japans instrinsic factors, like being an island nation."
6870,A coordinated response also probably helped.
6871,That would be unconstitutional in the US.
6872,Japan has virtually zero obesity and America is unhealthy and fat.
6873,"On the other hand, they smoke and drink a lot in Japan."
6874,"There’s probably a lot of reasons why Tokyo fared much better than NYC, but you can’t attribute it to any one thing."
6875,"the downvotes are because you literally are just spewing lies lol, think about how many aussies are replying to you and the OP with ""uh no thats bullshit"", go outside for once and stop getting propaganda fed to you over facebook."
6876,I think there is a big difference between planned changes and positive changes in one’s life vs unplanned changes and negative changes (the latter of which describe the changes forced upon society as a whole due to the pandemic).
6877,"The fact that you were able to choose to take a new job in a new place leaves you better off than many, who have lost jobs and/or stable living situations, sometimes more than once, due to circumstances surrounding the pandemic."
6878,I don't think this is true for Australia.
6879,"Obviously the Melbourne lockdown was torturously long, but our three other lockdowns have been for the stated time or shorter."
6880,"Sometimes, but supermarkets are never closed here."
6881,"I don't think it's 45%, that sounds high, but it's true the government complained that even people with symtoms are unwilling to test because then they cannot work."
6882,So only one in 6-8 people get tested (if we also add asymptomatic).
6883,Herd immunity is a myth.
6884,Just take a look at Sweden.
6885,"That blind guy with a stick, it's a potential weapon."
6886,Would you ban them too?
6887,"Wheelchairs take too much space, let's ban them too."
6888,"Luckily, there's a law against people like you and it will be used with full force if anyone starts a fight with a disabled person."
6889,Some will probably feel really good when they grab that old lady with fingers like a crab and pushes her out.
6890,We've seen that in Canada and every store got slammed with the disability act.
6891,"Only a few got to court, the rest realized they can't win."
6892,"And no, people will not die like flies because of that."

6898,And we're still allowed to go to the shops.
6899,"I work across the border, so its been a shitshow all year."

6906,It’s not that we’re complaint.
6907,We just have massive fines and possible jail time for the average Covid restrictions offender.
6908,"If someone makes less than 70K, I’d imagine those fines would really hurt."
6909,"If we were compliant as a nation, no one would rort the ATO or work cash in hand 🤷🏼‍♀️"
6910,[deleted]
6911,Exactly.
6912,My life (in Sydney) is completely the same as it was pre Covid.
6913,I only did the small lockdown at the very start (March?)
6914,and had to wear a mask in shops for three weeks.
6915,That's it.
6916,"I'm maskless, my kids go to school and hang out with their friends, we see family and friends regularly, I can get any medical issue dealt with easily, and my friends who are nurses and doctors aren't dealing with big numbers of very sick people."
6917,I'm very happy with our response.
6918,[removed]
6919,Mass vaccinations didn't have a time to have that effect yet.
6920,"Only a small percent of the population got the vaccine, that cannot be a driving factor."
6921,"Yes, that was the point of article, congratulations: people want a better healthcare system in general, but when pressed, they don't actually want to change theirs."
6922,Because they like it.
6923,Good job.
6924,How old are you?
6925,?
6926,So what?
6927,The bottleneck right now is having to prioritize a highly specific group or groups of people.
6928,As soon as the average person can get a vaccine from an average pharmacy this is over in the next month.
6929,Mark my words: look for the hospital numbers and case counts to crater one month after Walgreens and CVS start giving out vaccines to average people.
6930,Men’s Rights Activists?
6931,"Yes because it's a torture facility that the US government decided it could use to lock people up indefinitely and cause immeasurable psychological harm to, and not be held accountable for since it wasn't on the mainland"
6932,Yep.
6933,OP is going around posting every anti school article they can find.
6934,There's a broad consensus that schools should be open.
6935,"Here’s a good thread from an actual expert about the variants:


https://twitter.com/k_g_andersen/status/1355689990487896065?s=21"
6936,We don't know if it's more severe.
6937,Possibly not.
6938,The only data we have is that more people seem to by symptomatic with it.
6939,If case fatality seems higher (even that's not sure) than that can be explained by this face.
6940,"As they say: science and research is a slow process, not days, not weeks, rather years until we will have answers."
6941,"Psychologists literally save lives in some cases, and it’s one of the few professions where masks are detrimental as well."
6942,I would argue that they need vaccines as much as the other medical professions.
6943,"Japan may be under reporting deaths, or misattributing them to  other causes, or any number of problems."
6944,They also used to claim they had no homeless population.
6945,New York over the summer was testing more than any other state and had the lowest infection rate among those tested.
6946,"New York's rate from June 5th through September 26th never went above 1.5%, which it never going above 1% from August 4th through September 26th."
6947,What New York was doing in the summer was working with its phased reopenings and not allowing certain things to be open.
6948,"But after the weather got cold, combined with COVID fatigue, as well as a certain ""type"" of person not buying into COVID for ""reasons,"" New York now is not doing amazing again."
6949,"We're not in a dire situation, but we're not even close to the summer levels."
6950,"So I'd say what New York did worked, the problem now is getting people to actually behave and not just arbitrarily decide ""I'm going to hang out with friends and not care anymore."""
6951,That's the hard part.
6952,"Yep, amazed it is not used everywhere."
6953,Even in Victoria where things got out of hand it was stabilised and now life is nearly back to normal without people dying.
6954,Not sure about Taiwan but rellies in NZ had it way worse than us although well see how things go here in Perth over the next couple of weeks
6955,AUS!
6956,AUS!
6957,AUS!
6958,If things are open people assume it's ok to go to them and they assume they are being careful.
6959,These people are usually wrong.
6960,"Some pay for it, others don't."
6961,"State Goverments, if Scotty has his way we would be up shit creek right now"
6962,"Someone’s a bit upset Australia hasent fucked the pandemic up, killerjerick is right it is peaceful here down under"
6963,"Help me here,we now have what 1,2,3?"
6964,"Different types, whose to say the vaccines out will help with these strains?"
6965,"And, let's say more are discovered,does that mean producing more and a different vaccine?"
6966,"I'm patiently waiting my turn,and things are changing day to day."
6967,"Very confusing, can ya eli5 ,thank you."
6968,I’m a RN on a covid unit and I’ve seen 3 people in the last week come in with those same issues after the vaccine
6969,Constant fear of the next draconian lockdown?
6970,We have a lot fewer lockdowns than Europe or the US.
6971,No fear here.
6972,The Australian government does deserve criticism because its border policy could be better.
6973,But it's a better policy than many countries currently have.
6974,It's funny when people from overseas comment on what it's like in Australia.
6975,You clearly have very little understanding of what it's actually like here.
6976,"But muhh variants 😱😱 (aka the same ones that have been here for literal months, yes the UK, yes the SA)"
6977,If only we had some kind of national organisation that could sort this out.
6978,But who would lead it?
6979,"Here’s a fantastic Twitter thread from an expert in the field answering your question:

6981,"We don't call yearly flu vaccines ""booster vaccines"", so I feel your terminology is wrong here."
6982,Let's call it a yearly corona vaccine instead.
6983,"If the SA/BR variant combines with the UK variant to add deletions to the receptor binding domain on the spike protein but keeps all the important mutations that maintain its higher virulence, reinfection, antibody neutralization, etc."
6984,We would need a completely new vaccine because the current ones only focus on the spike so all those changes would not allow the vaccine to work.
6985,"I doubt it’ll happen, but it’s a huge risk."
6986,I would literally shit myself.
6987,But will those vaccines undergo the same rigorous Phase 1 to Phase 3 trials to determine that they are truly safe and efficacious?
6988,&gt;you're being down voted but your comment is so true.
6989,"australians don't want to admit that there was a better way of handling this whole situation as new zealand, taiwan and iceland and singapore have demonstrated without resorting to travel exit bans."
6990,"unfortunately, the side effect of this ban has resulted in stoking the xenophobic attitude of Australians."
6991,"Not even their fellow overseas Australians have been spared, as they are viewed as being selfish and unaustralian for daring to want to live anywhere else but australia."
6992,"in their minds, we should all feel grateful and shut up and not ever question how things are run."
6993,"Lol, mild climate?"
6994,Florida never even did a real lockdown so he has no business to say it does or doesn't work.
6995,Light 'em up!
6996,I am surprised people arent even considering the new variants.
6997,Usually these variants are not something to worry about but there are at least two that reduce vaccine effectiveness.
6998,Transmission of virus is more widespread allowing more variants like SA variant to form.
6999,"In addition, if vaccines dont prevent infection, imagine if we resumed normal life and two months later(due to increased transmission caused by resuming normal life) a variant that made vaccines completely useless was formed?"
7000,"Considering how dangerous Covid is, this happening is not totally unrealistic."
7001,"The NT already does that, and Qld was looking into doing that."

7003,"It should, but it won't."
7004,"Which is sad, because we saw what shortcuts can do in the case of Boeing 737Max which then killed hundreds."

7006,We only saw a small uptick after the holidays

7008,Don’t think employers should have the authoritah to mandate employees take the vaccine.

7010,Worse how?

7012,Dude stop posting old and misleading articles about schools.
7013,[The consensus is they should open.

7015,"To be fair the vaccine will still work, regardless of who scoops out your eyeballs"
7016,"My understanding was that there were no claims on transmission coming out of phase III trials, since it wasn't the basis for vaccine approval, and would require much more data."
7017,"I understand now that more widespread vaccinations are occurring, that transmission data was being gathered."
7018,The OP study being one of the first to address this.
7019,"So really just speculation on my part, but I am following the conventional wisdom of those with far more experience in the topic."
7020,&gt;…we still do not know if someone who was vaccinated can develop asymptomatic infection and transmit the virus.
7021,"Although the phase 3 clinical trials were designed to determine whether vaccinated individuals are protected against disease, it will also be important to understand whether vaccinated individuals are less likely to transmit the virus."
7022,This is likely but not ensured.

7029,I think you meant to say Extreme Right or maybe Right Wing but just put “Right?”
7030,[removed]
7031,The real question is will people get a vaccine every year?
7032,One that makes you feel like shit for a couple days and you need 2 of them ?
7033,"No, no they won’t."
7034,There were cities near me where hospitals had dozens of doses go bad because the staff they were meant for refused to be vaccinated.
7035,I was dumbfounded.
7036,*That's great!
7037,"* Now, before rejoining the world, be sure to get a shot of the vaccine that those other countries you love to shit on did virtually all of the legwork producing, before handing it to you well in advance of people in poorer countries."
7038,"And as always, continue preaching about how you guys had some *brilliant* strategy that no one else could have dared dream up (closing your borders), and that your geographic isolation and limited number of entry points had *nothing at all* to do with how things turned out."
7039, Very common with vaccines.
7040,Almost 11 percent of reported adverse reactions have been fevers and thats out of about 2 million people who reported through the CDC self reporting system.
7041,It’s very unlikely they have covid.
7042,Much more likely it’s as a result of the immune response.
7043,This is basically our first rodeo.
7044,The contract tracers have yet to be properly tested so it makes sense to shut down to give the health system time to check it has the systems in place to go for lighter approaches.
7045,The title and the body of the article are basically opposite.
7046,The SA variant won't give vaccine recipients severe covid.
7047,I have no idea how many mutations if at all are needed to evade T cell response.
7048,I see a lot of questions here asking about the other 2 in 3.
7049,"As one of those, I figured I'd shed some light on why I'm OK with the lock downs."
7050,Prior to june of 2017 I was a full time parent for 4 years with a casual job while kids were at school/daycare and saving up to study.
7051,I was in a relationship and a functioning adult.
7052,"My ex (and mother of the kids) asked to move back in with me when the guy she left me for broke up with her, I said no."
7053,What followed was a 2 month long stalking and harassment campaign by my ex targeting myself and my gf.
7054,Only stopping when I got a restraining order.
7055,"My ex's response to the retaining order was to take the kids out of school the next morning after I dropped them off and make a false report of sexual abuse of our 3 year old, against me."
7056,It was investigated by both DCP and then again by family Court.
7057,Thrown out both times and ex warned to never bring it up again.
7058,So she spread the rumor socially instead.
7059,"Those who knew me, cut off contact with my ex."
7060,It's the people who dont know me who believe her.
7061,They are the ones who have targeted me.
7062,"I have been living in fear since then being repeatedly attacked, stalked and harassed in public."
7063,Except when there is a lock down.
7064,It's the one time I get any peace.
7065,Since during lock downs there are almost no cars outside the apartment so anyone watching my place stand out.
7066,There aren't any crowds in public places for them to blend in with so I can move more freely to get affidavits witnessed or get food/medication (diagnosed with PTSD as a result of ex's tantrum).
7067,My heart goes out to anyone negatively affected by the lock downs or virus.
7068,I have been isolating myself since 2017 and it was a horrible thing to get used to.
7069,But I had one hell of an incentive program.
7070,"Ending up in hospital after an attempted social outing really adjusts what you are comfortable with, quickly."
7071,But I had the advantage of being able to actually see why I couldn't go out.
7072,It made it easier for me to rationalize.
7073,"I can't even imagine what it must be like to go from a normal life, to a locked down existence because of something that a lot of people haven't personally seen the existence of."
7074,"I'm not saying it's not real, just that it must be hard for those who haven't seen someone close to them hurt by this virus but are locked down all the same."
7075,Having to reconcile their suffering with something they are only hearing about in news outlets is testing a non existent faith.

7084,Especially when you consider the current timetable claims that we’ll only have maybe 100 million doses of J&amp;J by the time we have almost 400 million doses of the mRNA vaccine.
7085,There is no fear from lockdowns.
7086,Many millions of Australians will never leave our shores.

7119,This is why the people on sub claiming well be back to normal by like May are full of shit.
7120,Like I think we’ll basically be back to normal by late summer but masks are gonna be with us for most of 2021 and people need to accept that now instead of deluding themselves.
7121,I think we’ll see restrictions lifted sooner than that but masks are gonna be around at least in places that currently require them.

7520,Ignoring science when they don’t?
7521,Can you provide an example?
7522,I’m saying there’s no data to support the idea that mutations will evolve to bypass *all protective immunity*...... can you provide said data?
7523,"Science isn’t opinion pieces from the NY Times or 2 minute quotes from Dr. Fauci - it’s a methodology that involves proper sampling theory, rigorous data analysis, hypothesis testing, etc."
7524,It’s a very long and drawn out process that I find many people here don’t have the time for.
7525,I’m actually doing the *opposite* of what you’re suggesting - I’m saying science is more than just citing facts and needs to be met with proper data that backs up what you say - there is no data to suggest anything about mutations blowing past all protective immunity.
7526,I don't know.

7569,"There is no ""export ban"" for UK vaccines comparable to the US  executive order."
7570,UK AZ factories will be used to make doses for the EU.
7571,The dispute is simply on the timing.
7572,AZ is insisting on using its UK plants exclusively to produce for the UK's initial order before using them for the EU.

7597,So what do we need to do?
7598,"Stop asking for what we want, start asking for what we need."
7599,This pandemic could be over with in a month if everybody got vaccinated today.
7600,People need to seriously come down on their governments and harass them over slow vaccine distribution.

7631,I mean it’s a little pedantic...

7633,You're being downvoted for latching on one expert and disregarding countless of others who say that the hardest part was the winter.
7634,Funny how all the Fauci fanboys are trying to censor the truth.

7644,They are basically in the EU without being in the EU
7645,I agree.
7646,Where I live that process has already begun and I can’t say I blame them.
7647,Whilst I'm proud of what we are doing in the UK I really hope that at some point we divert some vaccine to the rest of Europe and then to the rest of the world.
7648,"I don't think we did anything wrong with the vaccine procurement and we certainly didn't steal any from Europe, I'd just like to think we could be good neighbors to the EU and help as soon as we're able."
7649,"Vaccinate the old, the people at risk and anyone else that's frontline."
7650,Then start to help Europe whilst slowing our vaccination rate down a bit.
7651,I'll happily wait longer if it'll keep other people alive.
7652,[removed]
7653,"The PCR tests are extremely sensitive, so they would pick up virus particles in your nose even if they are not enough to infect you."
7654,The fact that people are still testing positive after being vaccinated is not surprising.
7655,It does not mean that the vaccine is not working.
7656,We know for sure that it is extremely effective at preventing severe symptoms and highly effective at preventing symptoms altogether.
7657,I lost my taste and smell and I recovered to about 75% from what I had before.
7658,It took about 3-4 months.
7659,"Also, some things just smell differently from what I remember."

7670,"https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSKBN29Y2SA

I'd suggest reading the article rather than just the headline to see how wrong you are."
7671,Did they not at least have a form that asked about medical history or allergy history?
7672,"I've had to fill something like that out for every flu vaccine I've ever had, even."
7673,Every 2nd shot is produced in the EU currently.
7674,"And yes, blocking the Biontech vaccine could be a trade off for the AS vaccines, that go to the UK, India and elsewhere."
7675,As I said: that would leave a lot of scorched earth.
7676,"So I would predict, that AS will just give in and deliver maybe like 60-70 million shots, instead of the 80 million and everyones happy."
7677,They discard them?
7678,"That's crazy, there must be a better use for them than the bin."
7679,I don't have to.

7681,"Life has largely resumed to normal and while my country remains vigilant, the outbreak has been contained."
7682,Oh really?
7683,I thought we were terrible for testing.
7684,Got it the first time.
7685,You lied about forbidding exports then changed it to not offering help.
7686,Has the EU asked for help?
7687,That's a potential 10.49 million people.
7688,Or 21 million fewer doses.
7689,"Doses required: 74.4 million

At 600,000 doses per day: 124 days."
7690,The 3rd of June is when it's all over.
7691,Not really.
7692,I guess they like to go out a lot and enjoy life as normal without getting shamed.
7693,Pro-vax antimaskers aren’t that bad.
7694,Anti-vax antimaskers are very bad.
7695,54 new corona virus infections in the whole country on Thursday.
7696,China is doing fantastic.
7697,Or maybe missing several 0's on that number.
7698,No it wasn't it was to do with manufacture.
7699,I'm not sure tbh.
7700,I've had letters telling me to send isolate.

7702,As I've got a lung condition I think I'm on this list.
7703,"And truth be told, my condition is completely controlled with tablets and a pink inhaler and I can do anything I want."
7704,"However, as COVID affects your lungs, and I've got a lung condition, I think that's why they put me on the list."

7706,"It's the parlour trick preferred by biased ""journalists""."
7707,"The current projection is for the US to have offered vaccination to all adults by around June, give or take a month"

7711,They did it in Doctor Who.
7712,Would be useful haha.
7713,[deleted]
7714,Why are you writing like a poorly coded bot?
7715,The proven success of the vaccines is to reduce severe covid.
7716,"They probably have some effect on preventing lesser infections, but definitely not full protection"
7717,the Moderna and Pfizer vaccines are very effective at preventing infections as far as vaccines go.
7718,but they're not 100% in that department.
7719,"data will come out on transmission soon, but it's likely good news."
7720,we also don't know how much time had elapsed between these individuals getting jabbed and getting infected.
7721,the second doses for Moderna and Pfizer take a little over a week to take their full effect.
7722,it's even longer for the first dose.
7723,"AstraZeneca received over 300 million euros, of which over 200 million has already been received, and 6 months to sort these things out to deliver 120 million vaccines, which was the initial goal."
7724,Now it is 31 million (40 today) doses.
7725,And they only discovered the disappearance of 59 million vaccines a week ago.
7726,"So what were those 6 months and 300 million euros for, if you are gonna announce a week before approval you missed the initial goal with 89 million vaccines."
7727,"&amp;#x200B;

&gt; This one was, according to the CEO, and if the Commission have a legal argument on that, they can put it in-front of a Belgium judge and make their case, which to date, they have failed to do."
7728,I think it is this clause that explicitly states AZ cannot be obliged to any other third party contract under any circumstance.
7729,So contractually they are not allowed to put the UK in front of the EU.
7730,"If they did, it is a breach of contract."
7731,"It is clause 13.1 - e of the AZ-EU contract:

&gt;AstraZeneca represents, warrants and covenants to the Commission and the Participating Member States that it is not under any obligation, contractual or otherwise, to any Person or third party in respect of the Initial Europe Doses or that conflicts with or is inconsistent in any material respect with the terms of this Agreement or that would impede the complete fulfillment of its obligations under this Agreement;

But I'm not a legal expert, so I prefer to stick to newspapers:

&gt;According to Soriot, there is no breach of contract because the contract would merely require ""the best possible effort"" to honor the agreements."
7732,"According to him, there was no hard obligation."
7733,"In addition, ***he suggested that the United Kingdom had priority for deliveries because London signed a contract with AstraZeneca ahead of the EU."
7734,"***  
&gt;  
&gt;...  
&gt;  
&gt;The contract also shows that AstraZeneca's two UK sites are expected to make vaccines for the EU."
7735,"***The pharmaceutical company does not say in the contract that the United Kingdom will be given priority***, as Soriot suggested."
7736,London states that vaccines manufactured in the United Kingdom are intended for the British.
7737,So it seems like the AZ CEO *lied* about this specific argument.
7738,"I’m sorry to hear that , be careful it’s not to tough to become addicted to the sauce."
7739,Emphasis on the p in ASAP.
7740,Many stores in Florida never truly required them.
7741,Big corporate places like walmart did but many didn't and definitely aren't doing it anymore.
7742,"Around here, it's like there never was a pandemic and it sucks so hard"
7743,"No it's not, they cut the number of vials by 20% to reflect that each vial is now worth 6 doses."
7744,"Yeah, their writing style is seriously raising some doubts about that person."
7745,"I dunno, but that's not a good reason to not do some science."
7746,"In fact, it's why we ""do science""."
7747,Sorry I don't have a direct source.
7748,They were talking about it on CBC Radio on Friday.
7749,"It's possible you're right about later fulfillment but I believe with Moderna specifically they said they were having manufacturing issues that slowed down production, so what was allocated for Canada is going to the US instead."
7750,Are pubs not already packed nearly every weekend?
7751,We don't have to know what the UK contract says because the EU contract is not limited by third party obligations of AstraZeneca.

7754,Did you forget to put a don’t in there?
7755,If not that’s pretty sadistic.
7756,Amazing.
7757,Go Novavax
7758,So you get the point.
7759,Good.
7760,Just started
7761,it says in the article.
7762,He wasn't vaccinated because he was being treated for pneumonia
7763,Covid using the Madden weather feature /s
7764,Not me.
7765,"I hope when I'm 75 no children, teenagers, and young adults think they need to put their lives on hold indefinitely so I can eke out a few more years."
7766,Or education is important and remote education is not a replacement for in person learning?
7767,Even here in Germany a Super Bowl party is typically 10 people.
7768,"There aren't many because NFL isn't highly regarded in Germany, but I'm expecting another surge."
7769,That's a fair point.
7770,"But it's also extremely irresponsible for the EU to put all their eggs in the AZ basket, especially with something as crucial as this vaccine which they've seemingly promised to millions across Europe."
7771,"*And*, Ursula von der Leyen apparently took on responsibility for this project herself - given her physician background, surely she would have experience with the difficulty surrounding vaccine manufacturing and act accordingly?"
7772,I can't comment on AZ's actions directly but I don't think there's any motive - why would there be?
7773,It's not like there's profit to be had.
7774,"Anyway, I hope the situation resolves itself quickly and European citizens start receiving their vaccines soon."
7775,Because ultimately that's what this is all about.
7776,They cry about everything so I’m fine with it.
7777,That just quotes an EU official.
7778,You are very busy spreading tendentious nonsense
7779,"So if health experts like the CDC and the Chicago Department of Health aren't good enough, than what standard are you advocating for?"
7780,Contract says we get first dibs mate
7781,If its not I think people will stop listening.

7784,Not sure how it compares to the flu vaccine.
7785,Same here.
7786,Cant wait to walk into the pub and buy a beer at the bar.
7787,"Not having to worry about booking table, ordering through an app and wearing a mask for each of my fifty trips to the toilet while i am there."
7788,"&gt;Given that Germany alone put in at least 2 billion in risk money , this does seem to exclude member state money."
7789,As always these stats only include direct EU funding to distort.
7790,Same shit different day.
7791,I literally put Germany in my post because I am aware of that.
7792,So a more virulent strain of COVID was circulating in the US at a time numerous super spreader events (rallies) were being held on an almost daily basis and then a bunch of people gathered (against medical advice) for Thanksgiving.
7793,That (this?)
7794,Winter wave makes a lot more sense against this backdrop.
7795,I wonder if that accelerates the projections that B.1.1.7 will become the dominant strain in the US by late Feb/early March?
7796,I love their current guidance for vaccine dosing schedule now as well.
7797,"It's completely devoid of scientific backing, even if it's changed due to practicalities."
7798,Get your second dose on day 21/28 (brand dependent).
7799,Up to 4 days earlier is OK but not recommended.
7800,"Don't get it earlier, but if you do, that's OK. You can go up to 6 weeks after the first dose, and that's OK, but don't go longer."
7801,"If you do, that's OK. Don't mix dose brands, but if you do, that's OK too."
7802,Check the pubs in Tampa next Sunday.
7803,Well they're starting off on the wrong foot already
7804,"This is dumb, let’s move on."
7805,That just quotes an EU official.
7806,We aren't vaccinating 60 million people.
7807,The top 9 categories should have a massive impact on hospitalisation.
7808,"&gt; Also, you’d get less depression when being with antimaskers 

lol do you remember what those people are like outside of being anti-maskers?"
7809,That’s a very good point.
7810,Ok then
7811,The code for the job of Army medic.
7812,Was one.
7813,[removed]
7814,Are you implying letting a pandemic go to waste?
7815,Money rules everything around me.
7816,Because Florida could have saved more lives if they placed some sort of restrictions (for example a mask mandate).
7817,"If Florida had California’s death rate (1019-1034 per million), 4139-4505 less people would have died in Florida."
7818,"If California had Florida’s death rate (1227 per million), 7600-8200 more people would have died in California."
7819,"I put a range because today’s California’s number hasn’t fully come out yet on worldometers, so I used 650 deaths for California today on the high range."
7820,Subpar?
7821,It offers up to 90% efficacy against mild disease and is 100% effective for severe disease whilst being much cheaper to buy and store.
7822,.
7823,"He set that goal well before he had taken office, but at least they’re not just settling for that."
7824,"He’s now upped that goal to [150 million vaccines in first 100 days](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/white-house/biden-ups-vaccine-goal-1-5-million-shots-day-says-n1255597) 

I suspect that will be upped again as we approach 2 million a day."
7825,excellent hopefully phase 5 isn't too far behind
7826,For the US and a few other countries like Isreal or the UK.
7827,"I think it will take longer in the EU, considering how slowly vaccinations are going there."
7828,"Same with Norway, with the exact same vaccines."
7829,"Learn to source your info 

It makes life easier, not harder"
7830,Your sources are caricatures and not correct.
7831,Direct EU vaccine funding is just a small part of the total spent by the 27 member governments.
7832,The EU pre-financed the vaccine and AZ is defaulting on its contractual obligations.
7833,That's the short and long of it.
7834,It's been clear since December that AZ is a dodge company that should never have been selected to partner with Oxford.

7838,Would like to get out again for sure but overall I've been fine during this pandemic.
7839,"The executive has broad emergency powers that could be brought to bear with the political will and support of the population (and like you say, congress could also pass legislation with the political will)."
7840,"You're right that it will never happen, though, and that's part of the reason why the US is absolutely fucked during this epidemic and probably every future one like it."
7841,We are too adverse to the idea of temporary restrictions to prevent mass death and disease.
7842,"These numbers should not be ignored, but it is important to know that this is still good enough."
7843,"It might not kill it, but it keeps it at bay while we are able to produce new and better vaccines."
7844,And even better treatment for the people who do get really sick.
7845,"If science stopped today, I would be worries, but we are just at the start of fighting back and even if we are not getting the KO at the moment we are on the attack."

7858,"If there's a chance, at all, that this could be a foot in the door for flu testing before flights five years from now, then they don't want to give that precedent."
7859,Because adults raise children.
7860,"Without adults, or parents, who would take care of the children?"
7861,Can these publications even try to not sensationalize literally everything.
7862,This moment has been brought to by *the good chemicals* (TM)
7863,[deleted]
7864,And this ignoring J&amp;J and potentially Novavax (I don't think AZ will ever be approved in the US honestly).
7865,Yeah not a lot.
7866,But anyone who gets it from someone who got it at the school is counted.
7867,"So if a teacher got it and gave it to another teacher, who have it to a bar full of people then everyone is counted as a outbreak originated at the school."
7868,It does specifically say 20 kids though but those could be kids who got it from their parents who were at the hypothetical bar.
7869,Your article says that's a smart thing to do because in a 6 month timeframe reinfection risk is negligible.
7870,"If i don't remember incorrectly the US should have 200 million doses delivered by the end of March, so getting to 150,000,000 by end of April would still be a disaster."
7871,RIP influenza.
7872,You're next.
7873,&gt;	As long as there's uncontrollable spread of the virus anywhere that can't be closely monitored it's only a matter of time before a mutation that renders the vaccines useless goes on a world tour.
7874,Agreed.
7875,No one is safe until everyone is safe.
7876,"""Has anyone... has anyone seen the—""

7879,I don't blame you.
7880,"I'm Korean and have cousins, an aunt and an uncle in America and I feel the same way."
7881,With JJ now promising 100-million vaccines in the United States by June we will be back to normal by summer.
7882,We now have three vaccine providers who will be able to ship enough to vaccinate our entire population by June.
7883,He's right.
7884,Not the same thing at all.
7885,The EU put in an order for X amount of AZ vaccine doses with the condition that these doses are to be manufactured from Belgium.
7886,They paid for the doses though and the contract specifically stipulates these doses are going to the EU.
7887,India didn’t order and pay for AZ vaccines.
7888,They made a deal with AZ (and I’m guessing in cooperation with other low income countries) to be the manufacturing hub for the developing world &amp; in return to get X amount of vaccines for the domestic markets too.
7889,So basically the EU paid a sum and put in an order for a couple hundred million doses.
7890,India on the other hand didn’t pay anything but offered a service to supply not only India but also other developing countries.
7891,So you’re wrong in the sense that India is doing it out of benevolence and they “didn’t have to distribute free vaccines”.
7892,The agreement specifically states that the vaccine was given to India to supply both the internal market &amp; the wider developed world.
7893,"It isn’t exactly a selfless act on India’s part - again, it’s the U.K. taxpayer who funded this vaccine through Oxford University."
7894,Oxford university has negotiated for the vaccine to be sold at cost price so they’re the ones who should be receiving credit here.
7895,There was until recently.
7896,He wouldn't shut up about hydroxychlor-equine.
7897,And the novavax one.
7898,Some smart people on twitter said it would be an even better candidate to tweak regularly
7899,Oh that's a great idea!
7900,The severity of the damage will be reduced by a large margin as well.
7901,"What people seem to be misunderstanding is that ""mild symptom with lasting damage"" simply occurred because the body overreacted, and attacked a place that doesn't cause visible symptom."
7902,"With the vaccine, your immune system is far less likely to go crazy and attack your own body."
7903,&gt;	stop trying to shame others with your woke BS.
7904,"Yes, the famously woke and radical *The Economist* magazine."
7905,"Looking like a 25 percent drop in new cases since last saturday, projecting what the remaining states may report."
7906,Eat a bag of dicks by the way
7907,Things have gotten better for me mentally since around Jan 20th.
7908,That's interesting.
7909,What were those 5 drugs?
7910,What did they treat?
7911,What?
7912,If it makes you feel any better I went out to eat during the playoff last weekend about 12 days after my first dose and just tested negative.
7913,You’ll probably be okay.
7914,Yeah man you got um.
7915,You cracked the code.
7916,🙄
7917,For the first world.
7918,"True, but BioNTech still contributed a lot to ending the pandemic."
7919,"It’s been almost a year, if you still want to argue about masks you’re obviously not going to change your mind."
7920,And learn to adapt and produce things for the greater good without profit being a hurdle.
7921,Maybe if they started giving it to the age groups most at risk for contracting the virus - the people going to work - we’d start to get rid of this virus
7922,I agree and you’re right.
7923,But it’s annoying listening to a “mask up and trust science” medical community that has like a 40% vaccine refusal rate.
7924,All the science says these vaccines are safe and effective.
7925,[deleted]
7926,I want the vaccine so badly but my parents wont let me
7927,"Yes, I think we are in the same page ."
7928,My opinion is that even if people are vaccinated they should not act like there is no pandemic and still wear a mask when wise to do so
7929,SARS was far less virulent.
7930,"If that makes you angry, wait until you see the amount of Healthcare workers refusing the vaccine because they ""don't want to be a Guinea pig"""
7931,Because the US was clear from the start that it would be like that.
7932,"They didn't allow people to make deals with their companies and then say ""oh well we fucked up and need to reroute the doses you already paid for"" like the EU did"
7933,Same here.
7934,Getting my first dose on Wednesday!
7935,"Of course silly me stupid delivery driver see I got the wrong job chip, me dumb, ill just go back


Your argument completely went out the door when you imply that people should be forcibly.... what be *given* new jobs ???"
7936,"What is this giving job nonsense 

You realize how incredibly out of touch with reality you sound"
7937,"I know it's all just virtue signaling, but tbh, the only way I've been able to convince people I know IRL is to be super open about my experience..."
7938,"Posting the vaccine selfie, talking about side-effects that I experienced, happily answering anyone's questions, etc.."
7939,Resilience in children is reliant on support from adults guiding them through trauma.
7940,"Those who have actually been traumatized from the long term lock-downs have likely also lived with adults who are under stress themselves and stretched thin, leaving them less able to provide the kind of emotional support their kids need."
7941,"I’m not saying that this is all kids, since many are having a lot of their needs met."
7942,But there will be plenty that will suffer long-term trauma from society basically abandoning them for a year or more.
7943,"Apologies, I meant that UK and US funded much of the Pfizer manufacturing ramp up and production chains (long prior to evidence that it would get through trials)."
7944,You are entirely correct that Germany paid for the initial research and creation of the vaccine itself.
7945,"Here's my rough, back of the envelope math:

We have about 93 million Americans with some natural immunity to COVID-19."
7946,This works out to be about 28% of the population.
7947,"Source: https://covid19-projections.com/path-to-herd-immunity/

We also have administered 30 million vaccine doses so far, all of which have been the 2 shot vaccine."
7948,"We're also administering about 1.3 million doses a day now, and that number is only expected to increase."
7949,"We have 100 million doses of Pfizer and another 100 million doses of Moderna ordered for now, so it's easy to see how we'll be able to administer all of those doses between now and June (when we're due to receive more), so let's say this is 100 million fully vaccinated Americans due to Pfizer and Moderna by June 1st."
7950,On top of that we have the Johnson &amp; Johnson vaccine.
7951,"The company released their data yesterday, and based on the timelines for when the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines were approved, this should mean we're able to start putting those doses into arms around late February."
7952,"These doses are 1 shots, which gives them a notable advantage of the currently approved vaccines."
7953,"Additionally, the US is set to receive 100 million doses of the J&amp;J vaccine between now and June."
7954,So those 100 million 1 shot vaccines combined with the 100 million Pfizer/Moderna vaccinated Americans comes out to 200 million fully vaccinated Americans by June 1st.
7955,This comes out to 60% of the population.
7956,Let's also say we need 75% immunity from COVID-19 before reaching herd immunity.
7957,Well 75% of 330 million works out to 248 million.
7958,"If you assume about 120 million Americans will have some herd immunity to COVID-19 by June 1st, an assumption that I consider to be reasonable, and then assume that the proportion of those Americans vaccinated correlates with the proportion of total Americans who have been vaccinated, this means that 40% of 120 million will have herd immunity without vaccination."
7959,"Which actually works out to be 48 million Americans, exactly where we'd need to be for herd immunity."
7960,"This isn't even factoring in the AZ/Oxford or Novavax vaccines, which will very likely be approved between now and June."
7961,"Even if you factor in a bit of margin of error in these (admittedly rough) calculations, it's pretty fair to say we'll have a great shot of reaching 75% immunity by July 1st."
7962,The one obvious flaw in this math is that it doesn't account for a current lack of vaccine for children.
7963,"But I will say that 1) Fauci expects a vaccine for children to be approved in the summer, and 2) a good amount of children have, and will continue to, acquired natural immunity to the virus."
7964,Mandatory testing would make air travel inaccessible except for the very wealthy.
7965,Testing is expensive.
7966,So are airline tickets.
7967,Many people can't afford the risk of getting a false positive and having to cancel their trip.
7968,"It's an even worse problem for the return trip:  the majority of travelers would have a huge problem if they are forced to spend an extra two weeks at their destination before returning home (hotel costs, issues with employers, issues with family members / pets back home, etc."
7969,).
7970,"https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.01.25.428137v2

The baseline sera dilution is 1:100 and all of this is still well above that."
7971,A decrease is a decrease but not a big deal when your still above neutralization levels.
7972,There are a ton of other factors that can contribute to getting sick besides pay and health care plan that have nothing to do with genetics.
7973,Can you cite any study that examines Covid death rates between white and black officers and concludes that genetics are a primary cause?
7974,Fear is literally the only thing that has worked.
7975,He doesn’t know.
7976,Cases are plummeting in the US and as soon as the elderly and teachers are mainly vaccinated the scaredy cats will have nothing else to hide behind.
7977,The trials were almost entirely in the US
7978,"I’m guessing the majority of people in the general population are gonna get J&amp;J’s vaccine, since it’s one dose and easiest to distribute."
7979,Pfizer and Moderna will probably be reserved for at-risk groups and healthcare workers who have a much larger chance of dying or getting severe complications from this.
7980,"Biden's one hundred million doses in one hundred days should be seen as an absolute worst case scenario in which vaccine interest doesn't increase over time, vaccine manufacturing can't be ramped up, and no new vaccines are approved."
7981,"Even if that happens, we'd still probably cross 100,000,000 doses administered sometime in March."
7982,The only way it takes until the end of April is if there's an unforeseen disaster.
7983,"A lot of things would have to go wrong for us to *not* get 100,000,000 vaccines administered in Biden's first hundred days."
7984,Not a big fan of articles being written acting like the variants haven’t been here for months.
7985,"Slaoui pays his association with a certain US president, but he deserves a lot of credit."
7986,"OP, I don't take credit for this but this is the best way I saw to explain it."
7987,There are about 330 million people in the United States.
7988,"[In 2017](https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/68/wr/mm6826a5.htm), about 7700 people died every day on average."
7989,"That means that  (7,700/330,000,000) \* 100% = 0.002333333% of people in the United States will die every day."
7990,"This is normally: no COVID, just average-year death causes."
7991,Assume we are vaccinating only a million people every day -- this would be on the low end for where we are now.
7992,"0.002333333% of 1,000,000 is about 23."
7993,"That is to say: if you took 1,000,000 people at complete random from the United States every day, about 23 of them can be expected to die."
7994,"Let's say that 1,000,000 people in the U.S. eat yogurt for breakfast."
7995,"23 of them will die the day after eating yogurt -- spooky, right?"
7996,Not exactly.
7997,Yogurt's not killing them.
7998,They may well have died anyway.
7999,"(This isn't a perfect statistical thing, though."
8000,"Some percentage of those 23 will be car crashes, will be murders, will be suicides, etc."
8001,"But some percentage could be, say, a heart attack or stroke that'll make it look like the yogurt killed them.)"
8002,"All that means is that, of the million (low estimate) who get the vaccine everyday, some nonzero number may very well die."
8003,"This is to be expected, and it will be overreported: news doesn't report on every single person that gets the vaccine, but they are substantially more likely to report on someone who dies right after injection."
8004,"Again, not perfect: I hope it's not overreaching to say most deaths are not out of the blue."
8005,"But some nonzero percentage are, and if they come in the hours after the vaccine there's bound to be suspicion."
8006,But there's a very good chance they would have died anyway.
8007,"Expand that to four days after, as your family member does, and a good few more may die."
8008,Also consider whether the deaths are exaggerated given the age range of current vaccine recipients.
8009,"Nothing's impossible, but given that the vaccine has been given to millions upon millions, we'd probably know if it was actively causing deaths."
8010,Medical professionals smarter than you or me haven't seen anything to worry about.
8011,It's silly to worry.
8012,Hope this helps OP!
8013,Lockdowns have always been the recommended solution.
8014,"And, we've always been at war with Eastasia."
8015,"The article is about cases in the UK, not the US."
8016,We’re irrelevant here.
8017,Well even Belgium got the contract to supply EU and look how they faltered.
8018,"India might not have invented the AstraZeneca vaccine but considering the 1.3 billion population, the country has no obligations to distribute free vacines but it's still doing so."
8019,That's got to count for something.
8020,Fair enough.
8021,With the uk gov it’s too little too late anyway.
8022,I’m just trying to get home and avoid the financial burden despite these measures coming into effect potentially for the US at some point.
8023,Whether I agree with them or not doesn’t change the fact that I might have to deal with them.
8024,lol Biden is trying to help out airlines right now.
8025,Even with lax controls in place they're only doing 30% of pre-pandemic volume because most people don't trust flying.
8026,Mandatory testing would go a long way towards restoring trust.
8027,"California, April 2021: Hospitalizations down to 0 but martial law has been declared."
8028,GameStop Megacorp police hired to arrest anyone who leaves their house unless on essential business.
8029,"j/k, my realistic hope for April would be indoor dining open everywhere; probably still at limited capacity, but reservations hard to come by as the pandemic is over for a lot of people mentally."
8030,Mask mandates likely still in place indoors.
8031,"It’s hard to say, but even NYC is supposedly getting indoor restaurants back on 2/14 (just announced yesterday), so I think you can be optimistic!"
8032,Of course so Vancine producers can make money for decades due to a new vaccine every year for a new strain.
8033,In what reality do you live were not showing up at work for months and paying for a hotel for months is simply an inconvenience for most people?
8034,"And what ""reality""?"
8035,"Announcing the closure a bit earlier doesn't mean more people travel, it only means those people that still need to travel home have more time to arrange that."
8036,Which means less crowding at airports.
8037,Or do you think thousands of people trying to change their flight at the same time has no effect on how crowded the airport is?
8038,I know someone who had that reaction after their first dose also
8039,"I think the biggest reason many say June (which I think is very possible, if not likely) is that the deaths and hospitalizations are disproportionately stratified by age, such that 40% of deaths are in 1% of the population (nursing homes) and something like 80% of deaths/similar hospitalizations take place in just 16% of the population (those over 65+)."
8040,This entire population could easily be vaccinated in the next two months.
8041,"Furthermore, most restrictions that are in place are solely for the purpose of not overwhelming our hospitals."
8042,"Once deaths and hospitalizations are at such a low level, there's really no legitimate argument to keep things shut down."
8043,"Regardless of what you think of ""long covid"" it is frankly pretty rare and getting infected with covid is in all seriousness not that bad if you are young, so the danger of long covid is not a valid argument for staying in a form of lock down."
8044,"Lastly, this sub follows Youyang Gu's model for herd immunity pretty closely here: https://covid19-projections.com/path-to-herd-immunity/ This dude had the best running model for covid infections and now has been very accurately been modeling the vaccination rollout."
8045,Take a look through this page to get a better idea.
8046,There will most likely be covid cases for the entirety of 2021.
8047,But that doesn't matter when levels are so low and there are virtually no deaths
8048,It's not like they'll be getting any supplies anytime soon so doesn't really matter.

8083,Rapid testing costs as low as $15.
8084,Even with false positives and negatives it still provides passengers with more of a sense of security.
8085,All those infilled planes cost a lot of money too...
8086,Meanwhile airlines are at a fraction of capacity because some people don’t want to fly with other people who might be positive.
8087,Other less developed countries already do this.
8088,"In the USA, though, they make excuses."
8089,Similar to N95 masks (people won’t be able to wear them correctly) and on and on.

8096,"&gt; Yeah that's the common sense approach, and now we've have a year's worth of data to support Florida's decision

You do realize that even if the whole of US had Florida's numbers, the US would still be one of the worst hit countries, right?"
8097,Are we under the delusion that Florida has good numbers?
8098,That also ignores the reality that not all states will be affected equally - ones like NY and CA were much harder hit before any lockdowns for a reason.
8099,The common sense approach would be to take stringent measures quickly and for a far shorter period of time while employing social nets to ensure people are looked after during the lockdown.
8100,The results (both in terms of economic recovery and COVID cases/deaths) in countries like China and New Zealand point to that being the common sense approach.
8101,"6 kids die on school busses each year, is that ok?"
8102,is 6 the threshold for where we care or are those 6 kids not important?
8103,"4000 die in other vehicle related accidents, that is significantly more than what die of covid so we should obviously keep kids away from cars."
8104,Some 3000 die from fire arms so I am sure you advocate as hard to ban firearms as you do to keep kids from schools.
8105,Fire arms even make their ways into schools so why would we send kids there.
8106,1000 kids die each year to drowning and another 1000 to overdoses and poisoning from household goods.
8107,340 die from fires each year.
8108,Should we ban fire?
8109,"or is 340 ok.

Do you keep your kids away from all of those things too?"
8110,"Accurate, my idle mind at work was entertained by my coworkers and random chatter now it's just me and my (sometimes dark) thoughts...eeeek, Way too much time to think (and peruse reddit which is good for no one's sanity)"
8111,Scroll through this thread.
8112,The nonsense brigade is shook that vaccination plus common sense abatement is working.
8113,The conspiracy theories being posted here are even more unhinged than usual.
8114,What?

8126,Who is to say more expensive?
8127,Office procedure that is often covered by even state provided health care at no cost or little co-pays.
8128,"Covid has the chance, just with time off work as most places aren't giving sick pay, of being far more costly."
8129,"&gt;So, you mean like the middle ground that NY, CA, Italy, Spain, UK are doing?"
8130,"Yes, the middle ground that UK is doing which is working."
8131,You are in a position to declare that nobody will have any lingering effects from contracting this virus 10-20 years from now?
8132,Can I borrow your crystal ball?f Or can you just tell me what next weeks lottery numbers are?

8137,Don’t worry.
8138,I seriously doubt you would be so cavalier if it was your kid who died.
8139,What planet are you on?
8140,Melbourne still had grocery stores open annd they could leave their house and they have NO cases of Covid anymore.
8141,Actually on reading this in more detail I think this is spot on.
8142,Fits in really well with the Novavax efficacy of 89% because in Israel about 30% is the UK strain.
8143,If it was 95% efficacious for the original strain for Pfizer and 92% with 30% being the UK strain you're looking at about 85-86% efficacy on the UK strain which fits in perfectly with the Novavax results which had 86% for that strain.
8144,Corroborates quite nicely

8161,The facts don't back up your rumor
8162,I know because I live here.
8163,If we hadn’t locked down the hospitals would have been overrun - just like they were in South Dakota.
8164,"As New Yorkers, hospital collapse is unacceptable to us."
8165,This is from august.
8166,Almost all school districts are being very up front with their numbers.
8167,Thats why the state didn’t need to mandate it.
8168,"&gt;Just because lockdowns SEEMED to have worked in China does not mean they would have worked in the US, Italy, Spain, France, the UK, India, etc."
8169,No idea what you mean by 'seemed'.
8170,Lockdowns clearly have worked in all those places.
8171,Go take a look at the daily case count in the UK with the dates of lockdown marked.
8172,Cases fell after all three lockdowns.
8173,You can do the same with any proper lockdown and see the effect.
8174,This.
8175,It’s not hard to understand that many people don’t want to be in an airport and then fly for hours with people who may or may not be positive.
8176,Then you have the people who spend the whole flight munching on the same pretzel or taking tiny sips to avoid wearing a mask in flight.
8177,It’s the same with other activities where you’re around other people....uncontrolled spread is not good for the economy because some people avoid certain activities.
8178,This would build confidence.
8179,Other less developed countries have been doing rapid tests for awhile now.
8180,"But the USA...where the cdc only just got around to mandating masks on public transport where before you had local, state, bus, train, and airline patchwork rules (and weak enforcement)."

8183,So basically what I’m seeing here is that shutdowns aren’t effective because people need to make money?
8184,This is why I want my kiddos to stay in remote learning until vaccines are readily available.
8185,what else can be done?
8186,"I don't know about the U.S, but in Canada, we had more deaths under the age of 14 from the flu in 2019 than covid deaths in the same age range."
8187,"So, this one article doesn't mean much."
8188,The US never locked down.
8189,Half ass doesn't count.
8190,The US also gets an F for human rights here and abroad
8191,"Ugh, the nerve pain."
8192,It really is something else.
8193,Nah he poor
8194,"&gt;And there are cases on the rise of people getting either one or both vaccines and shortly after passing away and we're left with ""currently investigating."""

Completely unsourced content."
8196,"If one wants to spread alarm, that person should (minimally) provide data to support supposition."
8197,"Also, you do realise this vaccine was made by scientists at Oxford University?"
8198,Oxford literally ranks as the best university in the world.
8199,I’d highly doubt they’d produce a “subpar” vaccine.
8200,"&gt;Unless lockdowns that are that draconian aren't possible in any other nation, even Germany."
8201,China is the only major economy that grew in 2021.
8202,They also have far less cases/deaths than even Florida.
8203,"So no, by the metrics set forth by DeSantis, lockdowns actually do work."
8204,"Also, beyond a few isolated reports of people being locked up in Wuhan, were there even any reports of that happening in major cities like Beijing or Shanghai?"
8205,"I certainly don't support the former, but what is draconian about the measures taken by the other cities?"
8206,"What about New Zealand, Australia or even Finland?"

8218,They’re both massive private pharmaceutical companies that handled the whole process from research to manufacturing.
8219,"The Oxford AstraZeneva vaccine is a collaboration, where Oxford University was basically the brain (they did all the research and developed the vaccine) and AstraZeneca the executor in the sense that they make the vaccine at a massive scale in their manufacturing sites and do the logistical work of acquiring raw materials etc."
8220,"Oxford University from the beginning when it was looking to partner with a pharmaceutical company insisted that the vaccine wasn’t going to be sold for profit since they wanted it to help the world end the pandemic &amp; advance science, not to line some rich CEO’s pockets."
8221,AstraZeneca agreed to it for the immense exposure they would get I suppose.
8222,Both of my parents are nurses.
8223,"If not for my abject repulsion of needles going into skin I would have been one, too."
8224,"It's still scary to consider not that people who don't believe science have a desire to care for others, but that administrators are willing to hire staff that don't believe science."
8225,"Yes, since the ACA it's more or less what they have in the US."
8226,"I'm not sure on the specifics, but here I think on the lowest end you'd pay less than 10 euro per month."
8227,The average in my middle-class acquaintance group is about 120 per month.
8228,"Most regular care is covered 100%, so if you go see your regular doctor you don't pay a cent, even before your deductible is reached."
8229,The only bill I've ever had to pay from my deductible was for my back surgery - it was €170.
8230,"Even without insurance, the costs are miniscule compared to the US."
8231,"The first six months here, I didn't have health insurance and had to pay for 100% of my prescription medications."
8232,The pharmacist would always apologize for the exorbitant cost.
8233,They had no idea that I was still paying slightly LESS than I did *with* prescription coverage in the US and a $380/month premium.
8234,"I had an issue a few months ago that required a visit to my GP, referrals to urology and gynecology, tests, scans, a small surgery, and an overnight stay."
8235,Do you know what I paid for it?
8236,Nothing.
8237,My €120/month premium covered it all.
8238,My mom had a UTI last month and paid $300 for the test.
8239,She spends 30% of her monthly income on health insurance.

8242,"That entire section is only about travel restrictions, nothing to do with lockdowns which is the topic of this post, and which travel restrictions are only a minor element of."
8243,"Of course travel restrictions are only going to delay viral spread, once the virus sneaks into a new country/state/town cases will take off exponentially."
8244,Lockdowns prevent that take off by keeping the R value below 1 and thus prevent cases and deaths.

8261,This is not nearly as alarming as the headline makes it out to be.
8262,"Here are some comments from experts (which appear at the end of the linked page):

""It is a well-known fact that any acute state of stress like viral infections can lead to a decline in fertility parameters like sperm counts/quality as well as a decline in the environment that nurtures the sperm."
8263,"In the case of COVID-19 or any other infection, the treatments (steroids, antivirals, etc.)"
8264,can also compromise fertility parameters.
8265,"Plus, the sheer mental stress that comes from a diagnosis can also contribute to a decline in fertility parameters."""

8267,"Therefore, these data should be interpreted with extreme caution until such time as an appropriate control group is studied."""

8270,To everyone?
8271,"I seriously hate this talk of less likely, but still pretty good."

8289,Everyone is being lied to and being fed to the wolves.
8290,Good luck
8291,I would even add to this.
8292,Some articles assume that the J&amp;J and Novavax vaccines would have had the same efficacy as Pfizer and Moderna.
8293,That is simply not true.
8294,J&amp;J and Novavax are both Vector vaccines.
8295,So is Oxford/Astra Zeneca.
8296,Moderna and Pfizer are mRNA vaccines.
8297,"During the same period of time as the mRNA trials, the Oxford vaccine had an overall efficacy around 62% to 70% or so."
8298,The fact that J&amp;J and Novavax are at similar efficacies should have been expected.
8299,"The immune system doesn’t just create a response to the viral RNA, but also creates an immune response to the adeno virus used for the vector."
8300,I think the lowered efficacy has everything to do with the vaccine type and less to do with the variant.
8301,The antibody titers from the mRNA vaccines seems to be substantially more robust that those from the viral vector ones.
8302,"Additionally, Moderna and Pfizer have both done  in vitro tests on those variants and have shown substantial neutralizing activity against them."
8303,I'll forward your request to the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel.
8304,How do you know that wouldn't have happened regardless.

8310,Probably nothing.
8311,Most people notice when their lungs get shredded.
8312,The people with long term symptoms noticed they were out of breath at a minimum.
8313,90+ percent of the long haulers had a lot more than a sniffle.

8338,I am somewhat concerned about the new variants.
8339,"Given the fact that the amount of days between a person getting infected and having symptoms is so long, and the fact that new variants can better attach to ACE2 receptors, it’s not impossible to think that there’s no evolutionary pressure to become less fatal."

8407,"I'm not saying that Florida couldn't do better; as you pointed out, they could have implemented more sensible mask policies, at least more firmly in certain areas."
8408,My main point of contention is it doesn't seem like there's a strong case to make for a 'shutdown' approach.
8409,"Improvements, sure, but the data does not, to me, suggest a heavy shutdown would have been worth it."

8411,"Grocery stores and essential services were never closed in countries with lockdowns, so what's your point?"
8412,[removed]
8413,The virus spread for at least as long as one is symptomatic.
8414,"Therefore, if you die during the symptomatic phase of the disease, this serves as an evolutionary detriment."
8415,"So yes, there is absolutely a selection pressure acting against mortality."
8416,This is what I don’t get.
8417,"Like, I get that it’s been hard for everyone to be isolated from loved ones."
8418,But the vaccines were on the way.
8419,Why can’t you just skip ONE Christmas together for the sake of protecting your health?
8420,[deleted]
8421,"Doubt it, that's just not feasible."
8422,"If we have to go through a 6 month+ trial every time it mutates, we will never get anything done, by the time the trial end, a new mutation will be found."
8423,[removed]
8424,Running a low stock isn't really a risky approach.
8425,It's the right approach.
8426,"A single shot provides significant protection, and there is no theoretical reason why the second shot would be less effective if given 2 months after the first one instead of 1 month."
8427,"In fact, there is reason to believe the opposite given our knowledge of immune response and other vaccines."
8428,The 28 day second-shot window was not because it is believed to be a sweet spot for efficacy.
8429,"It was consciously selected to maximize speed to trials (if they waited 3 months to the second dose, then that's two more months before finishing the trials all else being equal - potentially *per stage*)."
8430,"In fact, 28 days is really a floor... previous vaccine studies with multi-shot regimens show a significant decline in efficacy boosts if given too early."
8431,"Within reason, there is no theoretical reason to believe that getting a second dose 2 or 3 months after the first will materially change of efficacy boost for the second dose."
8432,But hogging doses in warehouses rather than getting them into people's arms *does* - the former is a difference between 70% efficacy and 95% efficacy for a couple months; the latter is the difference between 0% and 70% efficacy for the same time period plus an extra month.
8433,it really depends on the particular locale.
8434,"There are many hotzones in SoCal where infection is still running rampant, much of it do to prevalence of multi-generational households sharing the same house or apartment."
8435,There's really no safe way for kids or teachers to go back to class with this kind of widespread uncontrolled spread.
8436,But in more rural or suburban districts it's totally doable if schools are willing to distance kids and do regular testing.
8437,Regular weekly testing goes a long way at stomping out cases before they infect the whole class.
8438,Many college campuses require weekly testing and their positivity rate is fairly low.
8439,"For example, UCLA does campus-wide testing of students, faculty &amp; staff and their positivity is minuscule now... like under 0.5%, compared to Los Angeles County which is hovering around 12%."
8440,Tell that to Manaus.
8441,"So I'm a health worker, and definitely going go get the vaccine when I'm offered (fingers crossed that I might get the first one next week), but I have a colleague that's pregnant who won't be able to get it."
8442,I also have one with a severe allergy that is a bit hesitant to take it because of the reports about bad reactions for people like her.
8443,These reasons I understand and accept.
8444,I'll take mine and hope that enough take it to cover them since they can't.
8445,People spouting about vaccines causing autism or how they rearrange your DNA?
8446,Hell to the no.
8447,The problem is that there was no co-ordination between states.
8448,International travel to the US was barred for most countries and the US shut its land border.
8449,That doesn't do anything if the virus is already in the US and people can just freely travel between states with varying restrictions though.
8450,You just listed a bunch of things that aren't even being discussed.
8451,First off: rapid tests are not expensive.
8452,The per unit cost of a rapid test is $18 at wholesale prices.
8453,If you consider that expensive then I doubt you would be flying.
8454,Second: there hasn't been a mandatory quarantine proposed as a part of this testing.
8455,The testing is only a part of whether people are allowed to board a flight.
8456,If they test positive they shouldn't be flying.
8457,So happy for you!
8458,It’ll be a little easier to keep going.
8459,I mean I agree - it’s just something to think about.
8460,Which is partially why I think that we should try not to drag this out too long.
8461,Vaccinate quickly as possible and open.
8462,There are other diseases at play too so wonder if we end up with Super Flu or other resistant bacteria.
8463,"Right, especially as long as COVID care is free anyway."
8464,"After I wrote it, I thought of other insurances as the more likely pathway."
8465,"Not only life, but disability insurance in particular."
8466,I hope someone can answer because I'm curious: Will this virus become seasonal and remain with us forever?
8467,Will it eventually become similar to seasonal flu vaccines that we have now?
8468,"&gt;It’s gross and dishonest

Right, so what's uneasy about what China or Australia did?"
8469,Add New Zealand or Finland to that list.
8470,"COVID-19 spreads long before the host dies (often before they even develop symptoms), so there is no evolutionary pressure to become less deadly."
8471,The presence of people who disagree with you != astroturfing.
8472,"If you're looking for an echo chamber to confirm your already held opinions, perhaps look elsewhere."
8473,The US has 50M people over 75 years which represent 80% of Covid deaths.
8474,We'll probably see deaths decrease to a few hundred per day by late February.
8475,Okay thanks.
8476,"Sorry you so badly want everyone to be as unhappy with their healthcare as you are with yours, but they are indeed satisfied with theirs."
8477,Apparently not.
8478,Thank god the adults are back in charge.
8479,I’m not flying till after I’m fully vaccinated.
8480,I’m actually a big consumer with a household of ample expendable income.
8481,I did the math and in 2020 I spent at least 7K less than in 2019.
8482,People forget that it’s not just about things being shut down.
8483,Consumer confidence drives discretionary spending.
8484,My family is pretty much bubbled with my in-laws so they can continue to be a part of my kids life.
8485,No I will not get on a plane or take frivolous trips.
8486,That may be an issue in May or June but right now there are more then enough people who want to be vaccinated.
8487,Vaccination appointments near me book in minutes
8488,Okay
8489,"I don't mean to be pedantic (actually I do), but exponential growth has a very specific meaning."
8490,"And it doesn't mean ""grows really fast."""
8491,"It's good that [vaccine administration rate](https://ourworldindata.org/coronavirus-data-explorer?zoomToSelection=true&amp;time=2020-12-20..latest&amp;country=CHN~USA~RUS~MEX~DEU~GBR~FRA~ISR~BHR~ARE~IND~ITA&amp;region=World&amp;vaccinationsMetric=true&amp;interval=daily&amp;perCapita=true&amp;smoothing=0&amp;pickerMetric=total_vaccinations_per_hundred&amp;pickerSort=desc) is fast and accelerating, but it is by no means exponential growth."
8492,I sure hope not.
8493,It's pretty redundant and wasting precious time.
8494,I get an extra 2-3 hours per day to do as I please so I will happily WFH forever if I can.
8495,"But yes, it would be nice to go to a museum again, or a movie, or a festival or anywhere."

8499,Were there any reports of people being locked in their homes outside of Wuhan?
8500,Why wouldn't what Beijing or Shanghai did work in the US?
8501,But will group B leave their home before they are vaccinated?
8502,"At some point yes, but not during the winter."
8503,"To keep from catching it and shooting blanks, wear a mask."
8504,Why would a virus want to become more lethal?
8505,"If it kills its host, it dies along with the host."
8506,Viruses' primary evolutionary incentive is to maximize infectiousness.
8507,"Morbidity is merely a byproduct of that goal, but a virus is also incentivized to mitigate that byproduct."
8508,"Sure, EU definitely plays some part in the vaccination struggles, but Denmark has vaccinated 3x that of the Netherlands."
8509,"Iceland 4x, Germany 2x."

8520,Juan
8521,I see.
8522,You’re saying we’re putting selection pressure on the virus by taking measures.
8523,I think the statistical advantage of reduces the number of infections (which reduces the number of opportunities the virus can replicate and therefore mutate) outweighs any theoretical risk of social distancing.
8524,A virus can’t mutate to spread between people when they never meet.
8525,COVID is not an influenza virus.
8526,The whole mutation problem can be solved by finding the people with the mutations and quarantining them.
8527,"Just because we may have to deal with a few outbreaks doesn't mean life isn't going to start gradually going back to normal, just look at Asia."
8528,They developed a system to allow them to live as normally as possible until vaccines were found and they're focusing on the science like they always have.
8529,"Also, worrying about mutations assumes that we can't stop those with either more vaccines or treatments."
8530,"Yeah people will fucking riot if the ""new normal"" doesnt change by the end of summer"
8531,"You may die of vaccination AND corona (also a car crash, heart attack or choking is also possible)"
8532,London would like to have a word with DeSantis.
8533,They were looking at 20%+ positivity before they went full-on lockdown before Xmas.
8534,Now their rate of transmission is .6 to .7.
8535,Lockdowns do work if you're willing to shutdown all in-person retail &amp; service transactions.
8536,But no American city or state could afford to do that.
8537,"Part of it is individualistic national culture, but another half of it purely financial."
8538,The vast majority of Americans aren't willing to subsidize those who can't sustain a livelihood working from home.
8539,"Nor could they, if they are doing their trials at different times with different strains prevalent to different degrees."
8540,"Good plan, let's agree to disagree."
8541,"I equally cannot be convinced without evidence that Pfizer are willingly giving doses to Israel and the UK unless it is because of the early and large funding they both provided, but clearly without access to the 
 confidential contracts I won't be able to convince you."
8542,I’m not particularly concerned that an anti-vaxxer nurse’s symptoms will likely be mild when they get reinfected.
8543,I’m far more concerned about them spreading covid to their patients while they’re fighting off that second infection.
8544,"If you are opposed to vaccinations of any sort, you shouldn’t hold a license to practice medicine in any context."
8545,Health insurance can't really force vaccines without some serious issues.
8546,"Now, life insurance.. they certainly could."
8547,Yep.
8548,"They'll frame it as, ""Deaths due to the pandemic,"" as if they couldn't have been prevented."
8549,I've seen plenty of this already with the 2020 excess death data.
8550,"Lots of people assuming 100% of excess deaths are due to COVID, and none due to our actions."
8551,She pretty clearly says that she will take it if and only if the scientists say it works and is effective.
8552,I don’t know any Biden/Harris supporter who interpreted that statement to mean the vaccine was bad or that you shouldn’t take it.
8553,Trump is probably one of the people with the least credibility on whether a vaccine would be safe or effective; he has a history of being an anti-vaxer/promoting anti-vax conspiracies.
8554,I absolutely agree with what Kamala said.
8555,I trust doctors telling me the vaccine is safe and effective.
8556,I do not trust Donal Trump telling me anything about a vaccine.
8557,I'm so happy for you!

8578,"I know a lot of people view California’s lockdown as being one of the stricter ones, but I feel like it really isn’t."
8579,Thinking about travel alone- California really doesn’t have any restrictions.
8580,"Some counties have imposed a quarantine upon arrival, but they say they won’t be enforcing it."
8581,"Comparing that to other states who make you test before entering and a couple days after being there (and actually check about the quarantine), I don’t see how people can consider California to be one of the stricter states with regards to locking down"

8607,"Also, maybe you could explain why you thought it was so dumb instead of just saying so."

8618,"Furthermore, those people would have had more money to continue spending closer to pre-COVID which would give more businesses increased revenue, meaning they'd be less likely to lay people off."
8619,The businesses laid people off because they did not have enough money.
8620,"If, for ""low"" paid retail/restaurant workers, the government had paid &gt;= 50% - 75% of those wages, the businesses would not have had to lay those people off and they would not have gone out of business."

8717,Interesting!
8718,Good to know.

8734,Well for one if 600 kids have died from covid that is over 15x as many deaths.
8735,"For two, a lot of people are pretty fucking outraged at gun deaths too."
8736,Ignorant comment
8737,"Because they were ""mostly peaceful protests,"" probably."
8738,That line is a hallmark of emotional manipulation but it still is an extremely low risk to children.
8739,You think people were forced to starve to death for appearances?
8740,WE LIKE THIS SHOT 💉

8746,That line is a hallmark of emotional manipulation but it still is an extremely low risk to children.

8748,Tell that to the thousands of parents who lost children in car accidents if you think otherwise.
8749,Why aren't there enough doses?
8750,Because part of the 3rd world did not spend hundreds of millions to set up AZ manufacturing.
8751,"India, China and more did, the African Union could too in theory."
8752,Some people lost jobs as a direct result of the shutdown and some as a result of the government not providing assistance.
8753,These are both true.
8754,"When restaurants were told to shut down, a lot of them fired or furloughed waiters because there was no need for them."
8755,This had nothing to do with the government not providing assistance.

8761,"The northeast was flying blind, of course there were going to be more deaths."
8762,The later states had WAY fewer excuses.
8763,FL was a disaster over the summer.
8764,"Yeah, I'd like many people understand that virus just happen to *virus*."
8765,It's not like it has a calculator and chooses what's mathematically and statistically the best.
8766,Can the virus turn to be less deadly?
8767,Yes.
8768,It has to to keep spreading?
8769,"Not until mass vaccination, so no."

8796,It surely doesn't seem less severe.
8797,The claim that viruses will eventually evolve to be less deadly is misinformation or disingenuous.
8798,If Sars-CoV2 evolves for 100 years from now?
8799,Surely.
8800,A variant that appears next month?
8801,Not granted to.
8802,Virus doesn't just mutate out.
8803,Herd immunity achieves that.
8804,"Virus replicates, some copies will be different from original, other not."
8805,"Sars-CoV2 also features copy control of its genome even if it is RNA, and that limits the mutations"
8806,"&gt; *literally* no-one and nothing in 

\*Looks at Australia and NZ\*

That's *literally* not true."
8807,Frankly I think doing a few countries at a time makes more sense given the manufacturing limitations.
8808,"The vaccine is putting pressure on the virus to mutate against it, having a lot of spread in a country with a large number of vaccinated people should create the most risk for a resistant strand to emerge and spread."
8809,Just make sure your significant other doesn't get lasik and you'll be good to go.
8810,"Doubtful, more likely never."
8811,The virus is already mutating and resisting the vaccines.

8825,That’s incorrect.
8826,The WHO put out an updated statement today.
8827,Maybe?
8828,The reason I believe it was a decision unique to our school is because it is much different compared to other families I’ve talked to.
8829,Most do two hours of synchronous (live zoom) and then make up the time in asynchronous lessons (online software and assignments).
8830,"In the next county over, my 1st grader does more online zoom than a 4th grader."
8831,I had a conversation with the teacher about it and her justification was that she didn’t believe that parents would do the work with the kids.
8832,I know our district gave parameters and the individual schools had freedom in how they chose to meet those parameters.
8833,"Most of our energy goes into getting my 6 year old son through the 4 hours of zoom and its assignments that by the time it’s over, we have very little patience or strength for anything else."
8834,"I have a hard time with 2 hour zoom lecture and I am 38, so I empathize with him."

8885,That's not accurate.
8886,"Per COVID Act Now, FL has a higher positivity rate and lower ICU capacity than NY/NJ."
8887,"The case rate is slightly lower, but based on positivity rate, they aren't testing as many people."
8888,"Per the CDC website, per capita deaths right now are approximately the same (FL raw numbers are higher)."
8889,"FL also has a higher raw new case count, but lower per capita (although based on positivity rate, NY/NJ are testing more per capita too)."
8890,"So no, FL is not doing better than the northeast, despite great weather when you can do outdoor activities where the virus spreads less."
8891,Someone should spur this on.
8892,It's quite complicated and time consuming to set up a factory.
8893,It's not just a matter of finding a building and that's it.
8894,It takes months to set up a factory.
8895,The quickest scenario is really getting other pharmaceutical companies to start manufacturing pfizer/moderna vaccines which is starting to happen now like how Sanofi will be making pfizer vaccines i think from this summer IIRC.
8896,Presumably they already have all the facilities in place so there isn't much to do in terms of setting up.
8897,Now in terms of why not get pharmaceutical companies in Australia/South Korea etc to manufacture pfizer/moderna.
8898,Well one not every pharmaceutical company will have the facilities to develop mRNA vaccines and secondly it's also whether those companies would even be happy to develop other vaccines.
8899,I also imagine location plays a factor.
8900,Ideally you want a factory to serve multiple countries for cost effective reasons.
8901,Australia atleast is located quite far away from the rest of the world so you base the location also on how far it is from certain countries etc.
8902,Its about waking up and dealing wih reality.

8906,"Coming soon, tens of millions at 60 percent efficacy."
8907,"I’m outraged, which is why I posted the article."
8908,I wanted it to gain visibility.
8909,You seem to be dismissing it as some “nonsense thing” that is just fodder-drama for the random social justice warrior.
8910,I am not a troll.
8911,I’m focused on a different part of the article.
8912,You seem to be offended that race is in the headline.
8913,Particularly “white.” I get that.
8914,But this isn’t about that.
8915,This is about the program that is breaking down - and what is happening as a result.
8916,I hope they took photos of all these protestors and prosecute them for negligent endangerment during national health crisis.
8917,It’s a sham investigation.
8918,There’s not blind prejudice - just a history of China not allowing outside investigations.
8919,It depends on which vaccine and how long... but to be safe.
8920,They are going to hardly be able to get the contracted shot promises out to everyone as is now.
8921,They had to milk the 5 shot vials for 6.
8922,If they opened in one of those regions they could contract out those vaccines to that region and really do a global stomp on the virus.
8923,I would bet they could get government funding to pay for a bunch of the building in those countries too so it would be low cost.
8924,"Pretty fucked up, considering how worse this may potentially get soon...."
8925,The reality is that Americans were never going to truly lock down for more than a month or two.

8937,"You really don't need to shut airports down, you just mandate testing and negative tests along with strict enforcement of masks and ppe."

Covid19 deaths are simply measured as the number of people who have died 28 days within an infection."
9076,Which means the death values (which the lockdowns are based off of) are unreliable and overinflated.
9077,Exactly what will there be to come back to?
9078,I’m getting so mad at the press for pulling out the stops to crush the one thing we are placing all our hopes in to getting our lives back!
9079,I feel very unsettled lol.
9080,Thanks!
9081,Let's look at Australia and New Zealand... they still have cases despite being in the middle of nowhere and checking the few people coming in.
9082,"That's not how mutations work, they happen randomly, they happen all the time and there's nothing we can do to stop them from happening."
9083,Every single person infected is another couple of rolls with the dice regarding the existence of a new and possibly really bad mutation.
9084,The only thing we can do is to monitor the situation closely and stop those from spreading.
9085,I mean if they came why not just forcibly inject them with the vaccine?
9086,Also let's brand em so we know which if the crazy we got taken care of and which we still need to vaccinate.

9097,The solution is to fight it until it becomes endemic.
9098,We can live with covid being out there as long as it doesn’t cripple society.
9099,It will never be fully eradicated.
9100,We still regularly deal with the Spanish flu.
9101,The phenomenon of humans eradicating a disease is so rare its practically a myth.
9102,I think we’ve literally only eradicated like two.

9104,They didn't say anything that should f you up.
9105,The scary part was about how it was studied and let loose in the wild and how it's gain of function mutations and how it behaves it does not follow the path of other viruses/SARS again pointing to Chinese made.
9106,My thoughts are that we have seen the worst of it and we've turned a corner.
9107,Covid may linger but it will not be anything like we experienced in the last 6-9 months.

9115,"&gt;	Some of these amazon workers may die, but that is a sacrifice I’m willing to make."
9116,Believe it or not I do not think amazon workers should be condemned to death.
9117,And have all of them been vaccinated?
9118,If they get proper PPE and vaccinations I see no issue...but it seems like teachers are being treated like...teachers and generally getting shafted in terms of PPE and vaccinations.
9119,"Also, which state?"
9120,The qualification process for a micro chip is long for the first revision.
9121,Once you modify a portion of it you need again to qualify and certify the silicon but you don't have to do the entire set of tests.
9122,I suppose we could save some time as well with a mild change in the vaccin.
9123,But people life are at stake so not sure if we can take shortcut here
9124,Somehow the county I live in hasn’t gotten the memo about receiving and distributing vaccines in any kind of efficient manner.
9125,"They skipped 17 nursing homes in Phase 1, moved to phase 2, and then told all the nursing homes they’d have to “wait their turn” and that they needed to provide transportation for their residents to get vaccinated, instead of someone coming to the facility to vaccinate the residents."
9126,Took several people and a couple of newspaper reporters to even get that looked at and it’s not resolved yet!
9127,Can you name a single company that can do this besides Amazon?
9128,There are two reasons not many companies invest in a nationwide infrastructure that could support the distribution of a vaccine at the scale needed to quickly end a global pandemic.
9129,1.
9130,"Pandemics don’t happen often
2."
9131,This infrastructure is incredibly expensive
9132,From what I understand the long part of the vaccine development was testing and trials.
9133,How much tweaking can be done before a new phase 3 trial is needed?
9134,"That might be true in Texas, and I’m sorry to hear that."

9214,Who said we were?
9215,It’s coming.
9216,The mRNA vaccine is a breakthrough that will affect every vaccination given.
9217,You can pack multiple types of mRNA strands into the same lipid carrier particles used by Pfizer and Moderna.
9218,Theoretically there is no limit to the number of different protein targets you could engineer into a single carrier packet.
9219,This breakthrough will go down as one of the greatest scientific achievements of all time.
9220,The holy grail of vaccine science is a universal flu vaccine and this is absolutely possible with mRNA technology.
9221,"One shot could produce every target protein studding the surfaces of every pathogenic virus, cancer, bacteria, etc."
9222,This is a big deal.
9223,I LOVE THIS SHOT💉💉💉💉
9224,They were blocking exits to limit where people can enter and exit from.
9225,This is how you manage to keep track of people in quarantine.
9226,Only 1 or two entrance in and out.
9227,This was replicated in other countries.
9228,"If you go to Singapore, they have done this everywhere."
9229,Even large malls have a single entrance and exit per section so they can track who goes in and out.
9230,"It facilitates contact tracing, and allows authorities to know capacity limit for social distancing."
9231,I really dislike how people think about the virus and how there hasn't been any updates on how it spreads in a year.
9232,Like they think cleaning door knobs will stop it and that 6 feet is enough for distancing.
9233,This may sound arbitrary but should that count?
9234,I mean who could see a pandemic like this and not fund it as much as possible?
9235,"I had a sore arm &amp; a mild fever the next Morning, but by 4pm I felt like a million bucks."
9236,I know it’s a little unsettling knowing your not gonna feel good but just keep in mind this gets you one step closer to being able to kiss the homies again.
9237,I appreciate the devils advocate but this ironically would kinda help us as it accelerates herd immunity.
9238,"And also, travel was probably more advanced than you’d think during the Spanish flu."
9239,And we’ve had 3 big ones that are blips in history now like this one will be.
9240,So my point still stands tall.
9241,What are the facts in question?
9242,that is great news.
9243,two of my Sisters children are MD's.
9244,they just got their first vacination jab.
9245,stay safe.

9250,The claim about AZ is kind of unfounded.
9251,Multiple countries are using it widely and there’s really no reason to think their U.S. trial will resemble the others.
9252,AZ has enough buyers its unclear if they have any particular urgency to rush the US given supply constraints.
9253,They got approval for all Europe and the Philippines this week and probably Brazil next week.
9254,Despite what Americans believe those markets are plenty big enough.
9255,https://thedispatch.com/p/is-the-us-holdup-of-the-oxfordastrazeneca while lots is published like this deriding the UK trial it seems the US trial will probably read out by end of February.
9256,That is still early enough to get doses in March and there will probably still be enormous demand by then.
9257,AZ has no reason to rush given they’ve got EMA approval but will still likely make it to market in the U.S..
9258,They only use that if you are protesting for racial justice.
9259,"It’s easy for someone to demand that bars, restaurants, and all other events be shut down when they never left home before Covid anyways"

9262,We're still in Iraq and Warp Speed was way slow.

9264,Trump even tried to take credit for the vaccine.
9265,He called it a hoax for the longest time.
9266,That stuff only serves to hinder his team.
9267,"The last person who tried to sell me essential oils (even after they lost their popularity) was  a nurse, an RN."
9268,"She said it made total scientific sense and suggested it might even ""help with cancer."""
9269,Don't know what that was supposed to mean and don't care.
9270,The original comment was arguing that lockdowns are worse than not locking down and I disagreed.
9271,Whether you're able to eradicate or not - I am In favour of lockdowns.
9272,"Australia's initial aim in March when we locked down was the flatten the curve, not eradicate."
9273,Of course I understand the differences between us and landlocked Europe but Italy and Spain used lockdowns to great effect.
9274,"Whatever country, lockdowns work, and I support them, and that's what I was replying to and why I have my opinion."
9275,It's entirely possible but it's more likely we'll just get variants that reduce efficiency in the vaccines.
9276,Which I think the South african/brazil variante reduces efficiency from what we saw in phase 3 trials for J&amp;J and Novavax.
9277,But reduced efficiency is better than no efficiency so really not a major deal.
9278,But also we can always adjust our vaccines.
9279,We already do that with the flu every year.
9280,And Moderna said they're already working on a potential booster shot.
9281,So basically if needed we may need to get vaccinated again later down the line.
9282,But that's not a majdeal since we'd already have some level of protection the booster shot will simply further boost our immunity.
9283,To sum up.
9284,Don't worry get your vaccine and potentially we may need booster shots further down the line.
9285,Although it probably won't be as often with the flu since covid doesn't mutate as much as the flu to change things significantly.
9286,"They're doing better in terms of [recent deaths per capita](https://us-covid19-per-capita.net/recent_deaths.html) than basically every northeast state that had a large early outbreak (MA, NY, PA, CT, NJ, RI)."
9287,"If good weather is the excuse, then why was Florida's outbreak in the summer with even greater weather worse than their outbreak is now?"
9288,I can't possibly understand how you could disagree with the statement that Florida is doing better than the northeast when there is literally less people dying per capita in Florida now than in those northeast states that had early outbreaks.
9289,Even if deaths per capita were the same (which they're not they're objectively lower) that's despite no lockdowns at all...
9290,wonderful news.

9293,"&gt;Because the government would be covering most of or all of their pay, and not everyone is an amoral jerk and will, if possible, continue to help their employees able to do silly things like buy food."
9294,"If you need a capitalistic argument for this because you think people who don't work deserve to starve to death, if a business keeps their employees happy and healthy despite not them being able to work, those employees will be even happier and healthier when they are able to work again, and will tell other people how great their boss is which will increase business and public opinion."

9304,I agree with that.

9320,Thinking that when you ignore the problems they are going to disappear
9321,Because science.
9322,The problem isn't the technology behind these vaccines.
9323,"The problem is actually producing enough vaccine with modified sequence quickly enough (and right now, having the vaccination infrastructure to administer multiple shots per year to the entire world population)."
9324,"As you can see, this has not been easy and my understanding is that the current vaccine does not even have the original spike D614G mutation in it discovered last April that increased transmissibility and is in essentially 100% of sequenced variants worldwide since the summer (already there in the new ones)."
9325,"Plumbers don’t understand fluid dynamics, but they accept as fact the results of fluid dynamics that affect their trade."
9326,"Nurses don’t need to understand all of the science behind vaccines, but they do need to accept as fact that they are generally safe and stop you from getting sick."
9327,The article is nonsense.
9328,The issue is real.
9329,The issue is that they are rolling out a vaccine that supposedly is to go to the most vulnerable first.
9330,"The people in charge of rolling it out, did NOTHING to ensure those people had means to actually GET the vaccine."
9331,"I mean, reading they didn't have a Spanish website???"

9402,So it’ll be fine... ok thanks.
9403,The AZ one is licensed all over the place
9404,Is this before the museum tour or after?
9405,[removed]
9406,That’s not including any bit of naturally derived immunity.
9407,It’s safe to say that around 5-10% of the population is less at risk of catching it.
9408,So we can probably drop the percentage down a bit.

9416,How so?
9417,New infections dropped 30% compared to last week
9418,Uhhhhhhhhh.. no shit?
9419,It's a vaccine

9448,They never got to the herd immunity level.
9449,That old study was just wrong.
9450,There is also no scientific evidence that the virus will not continue to mutate and become resistant in 1 year from here.
9451,Just as there is no scientific evidence to show that the vaccine will protect 12 months.
9452,Because they have not yet been able to collect the data to confirm or deny these theories.
9453,There is less scientific evidence on everything that surrounds this pandemic than there is.
9454,"It's like the masks weren't necessary because there was no evidence, and now they are because there is."
9455,"They are always late for everything, because they have no evidence."
9456,Imagine being so misguided that you are protesting a vaccination site
9457,Why do people keep repeating this bullshit about lost jobs and the economy crashing?
9458,The economy wouldn't crash if the government had done what ***every other government in the world*** did and provided more than a pittance of financial assistance.
9459,"Direct payments, covering employee pay, pausing rent/mortgage/bills."
9460,"You don't give businesses $1T to keep paying employees, you just give that money to the employees so they can survive while their employer is unable to pay them."
9461,We would have lost fewer businesses and fewer jobs if we had did this.
9462,We would lose fewer in the next months if we started now.
9463,Australia should make amends with China and source a Chinese vaccine.
9464,Seems like a no brainer - why bring politics into a public health issue
9465,"You really don't... virons ""compete"" with each other (that's an analogy - they're just objects) to infect cells."
9466,"If the vaccine slows or stops 99.9% of virons, then the 0.1% that has mutations that fight the vaccine will have no competition so it will infect all the cells."
9467,"The mutations were ""selected for""."
9468,The vaccine doesn't make a mutated viron stronger or more resilient it just kills off its competition.
9469,That's the concern anyway.

9537,"The return of indoor theater performances, at least professional ones, is ultimately up to Actors’ Equity (the big union for actors and stage managers), and their metrics are focused *completely* on cases."

“There must be a sustained decrease in new COVID-19 cases for a minimum of 14 days with a local community rate less than 5 per 100,000 population and a positive test rate of new tests done for COVID-19 less than 5% for at least one week prior to the start of the work session.”

9608,"Here in the US, the big talk now seems to be about a J&amp;J-made vaccine but it's only 66 to 72% effective."

9731,Some elderly people I know are refusing to get vaccinated.
9732,"Besides some financials strains I've endured, especially through winter, I've been loving my experience."
9733,"It was weird in the beginning, but my physical and mental health couldn't be better these days."

9741,"It could, but we are still over 3000 today alone, so it would have to drop a lot before then, and a lot of old people are still refusing to get vaccinated."
9742,So sick and tired of all my reality TV subs turning into places for people to virtue signal about how they haven’t gone out of the house since March.
9743,No.
9744,One.
9745,Cares.
9746,It’s a sub about a stupid brainless reality TV show!
9747,Its likely not though.
9748,Most health experts are expecting it to be endemic and are not advocating for a zero covid policy.
9749,"My advice is for you to:

1) compartmentalize as much as you can."
9750,Try to have a consistent schedule where you work on school work for an hour here and do housework an hour there.
9751,"I know this is very difficult with a 1 year old, because they will cry regardless of what you are focusing on."
9752,"But if you focus on doing class work in a certain chunk of time and housework at another time, you can focus more on the task at hand and get in a flow."
9753,If you don’t have a plan you will be reactive and change gears as fires come up.
9754,"2) meal prep, meal prep, meal prep!"
9755,Take one or two afternoons a week to make some of your meals for the week.
9756,This will save time and money because you won’t have to spend as much time each meal prepping and cooking.
9757,Plus your spouse can take a meal to work and not have to buy a lunch each day.
9758,"You can be more time effective, cost effective, and always have a healthy option available."
9759,3) read *I will teach you to be rich*.
9760,He talks about the idea of spending extravagantly on things you enjoy while mercilessly cutting costs on things you hate.
9761,"My advice is to not only do this with money, but with your time as well."
9762,"If you are like most people, you work all day, get off work, eat dinner, and then watch tv for hours."
9763,"Before you know it, it’s late at night and you have to go to sleep."
9764,"Then you wake up, hit snooze and wait as long as possible before getting up."
9765,Then you go to work.
9766,This cycle repeats and it always seems like you are running late and can’t get ahead.
9767,So really focus on trying to mindfully establish a schedule.
9768,Limit passive activities like watching netflix and try to do more active things like exercising or reading a book to your kid.
9769,Even something like having a meal with the tv off can have a huge difference.
9770,I would recommend outlining a schedule and sticking to it.
9771,Set a timer if you are going to watch tv for example.
9772,This can be very important to your spouse who works long hours.
9773,"Odds are he is not getting much emotional or psychological reward at work, try to do something that he can value when he is not at work."
9774,4) look at local resources that you have access to but have not taken advantage of.
9775,The best example of this would be a public library.
9776,"I know covid has probably impacted the resources they offer, but they have clubs and groups that you could join or take your kid to."
9777,"Even if these clubs are not meeting now, you can still check out books and other forms of media that you can use and your kid can enjoy."
9778,Many libraries have digital content that you can access from home.
9779,"5) focus on the things on my list, exercise, sleeping (I know it’s tough with kids), reading, hobbies, etc."
9780,these things are known stress reducers.
9781,Try to block off some time each day or week to focus on these things.
9782,"I find it helpful to not fill up your entire schedule, leave some buffer time so if your kid needs attention while you are supposed to be working on research, you can have more flexibility to do what you need to do."
9783,6) take a deep breath and stay calm.
9784,Covid will not last forever and you will eventually graduate and have more options.
9785,"I know it sucks now, but it will eventually get better."
9786,"Just try to do what you can to be in the best position (mentally, emotionally, physically, etc) when it is over."
9787,Shit will happen no matter what happens.
9788,That is life.
9789,the only thing you can control is how you react to what life throws at you.
9790,Any hope we get the Oxford vaccine too?
9791,How do you propose these interstate bans?
9792,You realize there are literal cities amd city metro areas that cross state lines right?
9793,"Walking to your nearest grocery store could be interstate travel in some areas, or even just crossing the road."
9794,Going to work in other states is very common in some places in the country.
9795,Not to mention enforcement.
9796,Even if you block major highways crossing state lines there are tons of smaller roads intersecting them.
9797,Enforcing is impossible.

9846,You engage in risky behavior that kills 4000 kids a year with risk mitigation efforts in place.

9848,Having them in your house shows some level of risk tolerance.
9849,"You can talk about how awful all of those deaths are, and I would agree, but the benefits of engaging in those behaviors outweighs the potential risk."
9850,I think the same is true for covid and apparently the CDC holds the same view that I do because they are recommending kids return to schools.

9886,"Since there were 79,000 drug overdoses and 48,000 suicides in the US in 2019 that would mean that there were around 395,000 deaths from overdoses and 580,000 deaths from suicides in 2020."
9887,If last year was like previous years many of these deaths would be in younger people.
9888,"Yet according to the CDC there have been only 424,000 deaths in people under 55 from ANY cause between the start of 2020 and 1/23/21."

10040,Full stop.
10041,The notion that the Tuskegee experiment hurt black Americans belief in science is a bad representation of reality and its a common canard repeated by those who are already suspicious of science and reason.
10042,We haven’t had a case in my school since before Dec. 20th!
10043,"🤞(700 students - not huge, but big enough!)"
10044,"I do not pretend to be an alarmist, nor to screw up anyone's illusions."
10045,I'm sure that sooner or later we will control it.
10046,What I believe is that many positive messages are being sent around here (which are important) but that sometimes they are far from reality or are directly fake news.
10047,And I think they harm us all in the fight against the virus.
10048,Stay safe and good luck to everyoone.
10049,"Nah, we've been going through this longer than most of the country."
10050,We didn't have the luxury of denial.
10051,Any hardline anti-maskers are clustered into certain regions/communities but as a whole the city takes it pretty seriously.
10052,Mass transit is a ghost town anyway.
10053,I'd be more worried about getting mugged on a Subway than concerned about maskless straphangers right now to be honest.
10054,Regardless by the time things open up I'll have my shot and won't have to live another year in terror of anti-science idiots wielding their poor decisions like a biological weapon.
10055,1.
10056,"Not zero but no one knows
2."
10057,"Wear a mask, wait for the vaccine manufacturers to produce booster shots
3."
10058,"If 2 fails, herd immunity the unfortunate hard way eventually"
10059,Hmmm not cool.
10060,"The idea that Manaus, or any large city, could have been at 76% seropositivity in October is just as plain unlikely as anything you can imagine."
10061,"It's sketchy as hell, and the 52% in June was equally so."
10062,"The degree of seropositivity can vary somewhat by many factors, but there's just very little possibility one city in Brazil would be an order of magnitude higher than a hard hit one in Europe that got it much earlier, or indeed elsewhere in Brazil."
10063,Clearly they were never anywhere near herd immunity.
10064,[deleted]
10065,Yep this is the rational centrist arm of covid discussion.
10066,I enjoy it.
10067,Why not shoot them....with a vaccine?
10068,"yup, and then when hospitalizations are significantly lower it will be easier to give more effective treatment to those who still need to be hospitalized"
10069,Just an anecdote but I work in hotel sales for hotels across the US and this week alone I received 3 inquiries from large traveling theatre companies looking for rooms in Q3 and Q4 of this year.
10070,We’re talking a minimum of 100 rooms for each group.
10071,"Prior to this past week, the last time I got a request like this was back in March 2020."
10072,Things are starting to take shape.
10073,Slowly but surely.
10074,"&gt;  They just thought the rest of the world would work based on kindness

When in the history of humanity has that ever been the case?"
10075,"Always interesting how liberal politicians and voters truly believe ""world cooperation"" is a real thing when in reality, everyone takes care of there own as they should."
10076,Shame canadian politicians are that ignorant and naive.
10077,Some will
10078,Agreed.
10079,"Furthermore, they won't be able to give you a booster shot using the same vector, unlike with RNA or subunits."
10080,That's why I'm more skeptical about the usefulness of vector vaccines in the long-run.
10081,How exactly do you think Americans would react to the feds kidnapping people off the streets?
10082,If only  it was about freedom.
10083,No it's just basically them vs. us.
10084,"And if we are for it, that means they are  against it."
10085,There is no evidence to support that yet.
10086,"Right now all we know is that the vaccines prevent you from becoming symptomatic, and reduce the symptom severity of the initial infections."
10087,We don't know if the vaccines prevent you from being an asymptomatic carrier.
10088,"Most antibodies cannot pass the blood-brain barrier, so we don't know if the immunity conferred by the vaccine would protect against a potential infection in the brain."
10089,It isn't unreasonable to think that the vaccine will help.
10090,"However, the evidence collected so far would also allow for the vaccines to be far less effective at preventing the ""asymptomatic"" infections that can lead to long covid."
10091,And you know what else would help?
10092,Another quick lock down
10093,What virus you’re vaccinating for isn’t relevant to the vaccine approval process
10094,"I realize I'm being facetious and COVID is orders of magnitude more severe than the normal viruses we see every year, but EVERY respiratory virus ""damages the lung within mere hours."""
10095,We cough up the evidence.
10096,Then the lung heals.
10097,"I don't believe I was screeching, but I understood what you were saying."
10098,The US was in basically the same situation.
10099,No one is crossing the Canadian border and there's no data whatsoever to suggest anyone illegally crossing the border from Mexico is bringing the virus with them.
10100,"We could have shut down international travel earlier and for longer, we chose not to."
10101,&gt;People in Australia still need to wear masks.
10102,...and?
10103,"&gt;They aren't going to be anywhere close to back to normal for years

Citation needed."
10104,"&gt; California's COVID death rates are much lower than Florida

I never would guess that from all of the hysterical shrieking that California is the worst in the country."
10105,(Never with data cited.)
10106,Good on you.. you sure?
10107,[deleted]
10108,I posted my comment and came back to see it blow up.
10109,"Yeah, what you said is basically what I'm saying about fear mongering."
10110,"Yes, the virus will spread and mutate but assuming worst case scenario on every turn is just idiotic."
10111,"Take the flu/influenza it mutates all the time but we don't go reporting, ""new variant on the loose it's possible this one will wipe humanity of this planet."""
10112,Like get a grip and wear a mask.
10113,"Trump never gave a shit about young people, he just didn't wanna deal with a virus because he was a lazy fuck and was citing returded GOP talking points."
10114,"Had we locked down properly and not acted stupid under the command of a literal diaper baby president, we'd have returned to normalcy sooner while waiting on the vaccine (which, by the way, he lied about the federal reserve of doses and left none)."
10115,"https://www.denverpost.com/2021/01/15/colorado-covid-vaccine-stockpile/

""Several governors on Friday accused Azar of deceiving them about how many doses they could expect in the near future."
10116,"Azar said Tuesday that the Trump administration was planning to release a strategic reserve of doses that it had been holding back for booster shots, but governors said they have since learned that there is no reserve because it was already released before this week."""
10117,&gt; Being satisfied with health insurance is literally not the same thing as being happy with healthcare.
10118,lmao?
10119,Fine.
10120,Then they're not unhappy with their healthcare and they like it.
10121,Why does that bother you?
10122,It clearly does.
10123,You clearly think it's something political.
10124,But the reality is most people are fine with that.
10125,Why does that bother you?
10126,Covid will always be here.
10127,The spreading (and severity) of it will just be down because of the vaccines.
10128,"Oh for sure, I lost a grandparent and multiple great grandparents to the flu over the years."
10129,"Unfortunately society has decided the flu is nothing, and it’s deaths somehow are acceptable"
10130,What is the likelihood that a new covid strain that is resistant to the vaccine emerges?
10131,And what do we do if that happens to prevent large amounts of cases?
10132,Yet more generalizations.. sigh.
10133,[removed]
10134,"Finally south of 100,000."
10135,Yay!
10136,!
10137,"I’ve been studying leftist theory for over ten years, so yes."
10138,I know my shit.
10139,where?
10140,Certainly not in the US.
10141,"Daily numbers look better every day but it is hard to know if Biden's administration had anything to do with that, I doubt it, ten days is not much time."
10142,The big difference I've seen is that seem interested on getting this working right and figuring out the issues.
10143,"Personally I don't trust politicians much and I'm a pessimistic person so it isn't like I expect everything to be perfect now, but any improvement will be welcomed."
10144,China doesn’t kidnap people over covid.
10145,If people are breaking the lockdown.
10146,I would see them in house arrest and fined.
10147,Americans are putting their “freedoms” above others.
10148,It’s selfish as fuck.
10149,Let the rippin’ and the tearin’ begin
10150,[deleted]
10151,[deleted]
10152,No reason.
10153,The EU already confirmed to Canada they won’t block their deliveries from Pfizer and Moderna.
10154,This whole thing is geared towards AZ and the UK.
10155,Austrália is producing its own AZ doses so I wouldn’t be concerned.
10156,Just another sensationalist article to get clicks.
10157,Everything you say is true.
10158,"Exactly, the best thing for one is the best for the other, can it work the other way?"
10159,My argument is health vs health.
10160,The economy is directly tied to the health of the population.
10161,Money allows people to live healthier (heavily proven statistically).
10162,"Our current spending has protected people from falling through the gaps, but we don't have unlimited fiscal power."
10163,In fact we probably don't even have year's worth at this level.
10164,I believe the risk is insignificant enough to allow people to decide for themselves.
10165,"Our government is responsible to keep hospitals open with capacity, and for that reason I completely back shutdowns."
10166,"However they are not responsible for our actions that may result in ourselves getting sick, and we should have the free will to decide."
10167,Those who wish to take precautions also have the free will to do so.
10168,"Ultimately, there is a point where it's just not worth it."
10169,"Once again, suggest a better plan."
10170,I'm definitely not anchored to any opinion.
10171,Have seen a few states vaccine roll out plans to vaccinate people 50-75 in mid March.
10172,"Once that group is vaccinated, the mortality rate will plummet."
10173,Did the LA police subcontract out the security for this to the D.C. Capitol police?
10174,"The issue isn't the kids, it's that kids may spread COVID to adults in their household."
10175,"If community spread is low and mitigation measures are in place, there's no good excuse for keeping kids out of on-site school."
10176,that is correct.
10177,The problem with this logic is that people in South Africa who had the first strain were getting reinfected with the newer one although my suspicion is most of these cases would have been quite mild.
10178,Their data will tell more.
10179,I think it's a decently big deal but not catastrophic.
10180,Might push back reopening to some extent or slow down some stuff with reopening.
10181,Don't think it will completely stop it and we're in a much better position than we were in before.
10182,Moderna also showed a pretty large loss of antibodies to the South Africa strain although Pfizer showed relatively little.
10183,people with natural antibodies had a loss of about 5/6 against the South Africa strain which still would have been enough for many to not get sick from it in fact most but many still were getting sick or at least some we don't know exactly how many
10184,I think it’s possible.
10185,"If their goal is 2B in 2021 and they can do 150M a month at Max, and they do it for 8 months, that means they’ll be doing about a few hundred million between now and May."
10186,"And hopefully most of those go to India, Canada, Australia and the Philippines as the UK and US should already have significant amounts by then."
10187,What?
10188,No it doesn't.
10189,Overestimation of the initial infection rate is one of the four possibilities it investigates.
10190,What’s your point?
10191,"You think they should be dying at even higher rates, or?"
10192,Novavax it's not vector but is protein subunit.
10193,AstraZeneca is vector.
10194,And it's numbers on the original strain for Novavax were right at the same level as Pfizer and Moderna and they use the same basic spike protein design it's just implemented differently.
10195,The long and short of it is I would not expect the results from Novavax and Pfizer to differ dramatically.
10196,There is no adenovirus vector in the Novavax vaccine.
10197,It’s not minor anymore.
10198,We’re looking at a second boring sit at home summer.
10199,"It’s not minor, this is a major part of people’s lives."
10200,[removed]
10201,Why are you anthropomorphizing something that isn’t even alive?
10202,There are no “incentives” in evolution.
10203,None.
10204,It is a _blind_ watchmaker.
10205,"Oh ok, thanks for clearing that up."
10206,Really can’t wait for it to start rolling out so we can really put a dent in this thing.
10207,I did not include J&amp;J because currently it is a relative unknown when compared to Moderna and Pfizer.
10208,I'm not suggesting it won't work- on the contrary it is likely that it will for sure increase the chance of hitting the numbers we need for this to have a relatively normal summer- but until it is A: Approved B: Distributed C: Shots being put in arms I'm not putting my eggs in that basket.
10209,Pandemics can be complicated and frustrating to exactly 'know' when it will be over and for my mental health I'd rather mange my expectations until things are more certain than likely.
10210,I know I'm going to get alot of downvotes but I'm curious as to how many people will continue to wear masks past April u don't think I could go another summer of wearing masks
10211,"&gt; We need to get vaccinated like pronto, amigo."
10212,"I read this in a ""surfer dude"" voice."
10213,Despite all of those risk mitigations kids still die at those rates.
10214,Why don't we eliminate cleaning products because there is a risk that kids can die from them?
10215,"Why don't we ban cars, people die from them."
10216,"Why don't we ban pools, kids drown?"
10217,We enforce seatbelt wearing and put kids in cars.
10218,"We teach kids to swim, and have lifeguards."
10219,We lock away products that might be dangerous.
10220,So why is sending kids to school with masks not good enough?
10221,Why is risk mitigation not good enough when it comes to covid but ok everywhere else.
10222,Biden has been president for 10 days now.
10223,Have you seen anything changing in the state rollout of the vaccine?
10224,"You tell people its not a goddam game, and they dismiss you - now of all times - as being inflammatory."
10225,"Well, I say take an Advil and wake the hell up"
10226,I need to go back to normal so fucking badly.
10227,I’m not even sure if I’ll be the same person after this.
10228,"Nurses are hovering nearthe 50% mark for vaccination rate, doctors 90%+."
10229,Wrestling is another close contact sport.
10230,"If I was just whistling Dixie I wouldnt have replied...

We need to get vaccinated like pronto, amigo."
10231,Thats my message.
10232,Thats it.
10233,And that's one of the reasons why Hawaii has been one of the most successful states at managing COVID.
10234,I'm sorry.
10235,Those stories were awful to read.
10236,☹️
10237,Unfortunately had to take a greyhound this past December.
10238,Good luck getting them to wear a mask
10239,"Despite all of those things you listed to reduce risk, kids still die at those rates."
10240,"Why are you ok with those other deaths, but covid is a bridge to far that we need to abandon educating kids?"
10241,"What makes risk mitigation not good enough when it comes to covid, but ok for everything else?"
10242,No one seems to be able to answer those questions and keep listing ways that we try to lower risk but continue to participate in all of those things.
10243,&gt;Do you keep your kids away from all of those things too?
10244,Of course.
10245,"No joyrides, and use a properly secured rear-facing car seat as long as possible."
10246,Don't go into a home that has a gun.
10247,Have your kids take swimming lessons and learn CPR.
10248,All poisons and cleaners should definitely be kept out of reach of children.
10249,What the fuck are you on about?
10250,Get smoke detectors.
10251,Check to make sure your stove and oven are off every night.
10252,Don't smoke inside or leave food unattended on the stove.
10253,Or maybe everyone already having the real version is..??
10254,?
10255,I show up to work everyday.
10256,I’m in finance.
10257,Should I strike?
10258,Are teachers better than finance people or doctors or nurses or food service workers or gig workers or grocery workers?
10259,[removed]
10260,Because vaccines are actually much easier to make than treatments for most viruses... That's kind of the long and short of it.
10261,treatment also does not bring society back to normal so government is not going to be very inclined to fund it that much
10262,It is extremely likely that a new covid strain will emerge that is \*resistant\* to the vaccine to some small degree.
10263,It is extremely unlikely one will emerge that is sufficiently resistant to make the vaccine moot entirely.
10264,Really hope the FDA approves it before our trial complete.
10265,Would be great to get a few tens of millions of doses in March or April.
10266,I was hospitalized and questioned everyone I could.
10267,Only one out of six workers I asked had accepted the vaccine.
10268,"My own primary dr refused it, as well."
10269,It's scary.
10270,"I bet the fourth one in summer, as precaution from the upcoming Sierra Leone super strain, will work too, and then the fifth next winter to protect NHS from a tough flu season, and the sixth for the potential new variant found in a remote village in Cambodia... ugh."
10271,The CDC lists age groups as 15-24 so I added groups up to there and rounded down.
10272,"Newer research suggests that 10% of people develop symptoms after 14 days and 1% after 20 days, https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.medicalnewstoday.com/amp/articles/scientists-revise-covid-19-incubation-period-to-7-7-days however they are probably less infectious than people who develop symptoms earlier."
10273,Now that is pepper spray worthy.
10274,Do not fuck with the vaccine rollout
10275,Yup.
10276,"Wouldn't be surprised if we get to the 5 mil a day with more options, more sites and more folks that are eligible for a vac."
10277,If a patient is taking immune-suppressive medications then them having the vaccine themselves will not protect them.
10278,Well you should.
10279,Don't take your kids on joyrides because they like the car.
10280,Only do necessary car travel.
10281,Use well-secured carseats and seatbelts.
10282,Don't speed.
10283,Avoid highways when you can.
10284,Don't leave your kids alone in the tub.
10285,"If you live near water or have a pool, get swimming lessons as early as possible."
10286,Know what a drowning kid looks like.
10287,Learn CPR.
10288,Yup.
10289,The 150M monthly is just their full capacity.
10290,If they can pull off a ramp up to 150M/month by May that’ll be incredible.
10291,Thought I wouldn’t expect them to be approved until March.
10292,"When Pfizer applied for approval with Health Canada in October, they didn’t get approval until mid-December."
10293,Nowhere have I ever argued that kids do not get covid or aren't affected by it at all.
10294,Kids have relatively low risk from covid.
10295,They seem to spread it less according to the CDC and it has been observed around the world that they have significantly more mild symptoms then other demographics.
10296,Holding up a strawman doesn't do you any favors.
10297,All of that data is readily available online.
10298,A quick google search will confirm everything i typed there and if thats too much effort for you I don't know what to say.
10299,Most of the deaths listed there are things that are caused by other peoples actions.
10300,Someone crashing their car can lead to someones death and that is almost always the case when someone under 16 dies from a car accident.
10301,The risky behavior that people take is never independent to themselves.
10302,All of those other diseases you listed have much worse outcomes for kids than covid does.
10303,80.2% protection 28 days after one dose according to https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20210114-covid-19-how-effective-is-a-single-vaccine-dose
10304,F*#$k these people.
10305,They should be immediately thrown in prison for violating the rights of others.
10306,We have no time for their b.s.
10307,Covid is a virus concocted by (insert your favorite bad guy/girl/group/nation here) to sterilize (insert your favorite guy/girl/group/nation here) .
10308,pls improve on the idea and feed to Q.
10309,Lets see what happens.
10310,"Ecuador got some vaccines a week or two ago, 8k vaccine doses for 17 million people."
10311,I have no idea when they'll get more.
10312,"Thanks, champ!"
10313,And it's a stupid theory.
10314,"AMLO barely has an influence in Mexico, he's a walking joke."
10315,"New mutarions are always emerging, but so far it looks like we have 2 or 3 out of 12,000 variants that affected antibody performance."
10316,"The effectiveness of antibodies can be reduced, but likely not by a lot, because the spike is the virus' key to unlock the cell, if it mutated to the point of escaping antibodies entirely, it would also lose its ability to enter a cell, like a key too deformed to fit the lock."
10317,There is a limit on how much antibodies can lose effectiveness before the mutated virus is no longer a concern.
10318,"This probably happened a lot, we just don't see it because those viruses mutated themselves into extinction."
10319,"It’s domestic terrorism, is what it is."
10320,And it should be treated as such.
10321,D'oh!
10322,"What a nothing comment, I hit a nerve?"
10323,Well not sure what to tell you but the Vietnamese government has done a great job.
10324,Virus pops up and they lock down fast and hard.
10325,Lots of contact tracing.
10326,If it gets out of a building or neighborhood they lock down the district.
10327,Than the city.
10328,Stop all public transportation in and out.
10329,"Not many countries are doing hard lock downs, or I would guess."
10330,But as a westerner living here it is way different than what I read on this reddit forum in western countries.
10331,Also Vietnam is booming.
10332,"Slowed down at the beginning but EVERYWHERE you go, outside of tourist related businesses is busy as fuck."
10333,So is Reddit.
10334,So why are you here?
10335,"&gt; he definitely CAN have influence on Latinos in LA

I'm sorry dude."
10336,But AMLO barely has an influence in Mexico proper and you think he has an influence on 2nd or even 3rd generation Chicano's in LA?
10337,Thanks for the laugh.
10338,Thanks it helps a bit.
10339,"I'm happy for you husband, but I think you meant to reply to the person two above me!"
10340,:)
10341,Are you not reading?
10342,You are responding to a poster talking about his province.
10343,He isn't American and in much of the world outside America covid isn't as serious.
10344,"His province has 5 million people with 1,000 deaths recorded since they started counting."
10345,He even said 500 cases per day and 5 to 10 deaths when 110 from all causes is the norm.
10346,"Obesity is bad for you, period."
10347,"It puts constant strain on the body, even when young."
10348,It's terrorism plain and simple.
10349,Not all terrorists have dark skin and shout religious phrases before blowing up a building.
10350,They are denying access to the vaccine to people who genuinely want it and are not afraid of it.
10351,Right now we are only vaccinating the people most at risk of getting sick at this stage.
10352,Particularly nurses and doctors.
10353,So consequences of there actions will be in lives.
10354,Not just those of the doctors and nurses but also the people they treat it especially if many of them get sick and are forced to to stay home.
10355,First it was the weekly parades they held now it's this.
10356,I'm really sorry to hear that.
10357,Solidarity to you and your family.

10368,Why weren't they arrested?
10369,"&gt;Joanna Geraghty, JetBlue’s CEO, said that domestic testing at the moment is too difficult to secure in as timely a manner as would likely be required under these proposed regulations

Best case scenario: the regulations are written to allow for rapid, less accurate tests."
10370,Government either funds these tests adequately or allows airlines or passengers to fund them.
10371,US tests per day expand by the 40% needed to cover all air travelers.
10372,Worst case scenario: the regulations require slow and less available PCR tests.
10373,The regulations are (rightly) killed by lobbying and public pressure.
10374,Incorrect information.
10375,You can be child-free and still want the country to not fall further behind in education than we already are.
10376,"Or inequality to go up even more, since pretty much 100% of private schools are running."
10377,"It’s worth mentioning it’s almost impossible to compare US and Australian cities with official statistics because the US system of city, urban and metro areas have no real counterparts in Australia, where we instead have vague “greater capital city statistical areas”."
10378,"These are closest to US metro area definitions, but are still rather arbitrary and skew some statistics like population density by including swathes of unoccupied land and national park."
10379,"(And just FYI, “City of Melbourne” is an arbitrary 14 sq mi (37 sq km) local council area, not a city proper, it’s not useful for any comparison either locally or internationally)."
10380,Because the optimal way to ensure that the pandemic does the least amount of damage going forward is to prioritize those most at risk.

10399,Here in Portugal we closed schools just over a week ago.
10400,Fingers crossed this weekend finally new cases are showing signs of peaking.
10401,"Closing schools not only stops transmission within the schools, it also means parents have to stay home to look after the kids, and sends the message that 'things aren't normal' so that even the most ignorant have to take notice."
10402,Girlfriend now fiancé lives in another country and we haven't been able to see eachother in about a year.

10429,That's not a constructive comment unfortunately.
10430,"Given that California’s surge is due to the more transmissible variant, it actually is."
10431,We shouldn't open schools until a large percentage of the population has vaccinated too.

10445,"Novel strains start popping up which are more contagious and might be less responsive to said vaccine

One would only choose B under a veil of nationalism."
10446,"Fortunately the US isn't the only country with a developed vaccine, and the world had a robust response without us."
10447,At least we can both agree Germany had a better response than the US.
10448,83 deaths per million AND the most effective/first mRNA vaccine.

10473,An isolated island country no one lives on with zero world presence has their own set of the rules.
10474,That statement is true for each individual infection.
10475,Covid's high infection rate somewhat counters its low base rate.
10476,26 million cases is a large melding pot of possibility.
10477,He has tried to do some things.
10478,But the fact of the matter is that at this point there's little he could do.
10479,Establishing and ramping manufacturing takes many many months.
10480,The Europeans are trying to ramp up Pfizer manufacturing with having additional plants produce the vaccine.
10481,But it'll be July (Sanofi) till they start sending vaccines to the EU (5.5 months).
10482,"For better or for worse, the US is mostly locked into what the Trump administration did 6-10 months ago, which considering how otherwise he screwed up COVID response is surprisingly pretty good when compared to virtually anywhere else."
10483,Not to mention that the lockdowns in California have been reactionary.
10484,"They ""lock down"" when cases get high, then open back up when they go back down."
10485,"Of course you're going to look at that and say, ""wtf?"
10486,They locked down.
10487,"Why do they have so many cases?"""
10488,"Well, because the virus can also spread between half assed lockdowns."
10489,Do you think we won’t be able to travel internationally for many years?
10490,"And by aggressively protecting people from COVID-19, you made it possible for kids to go back to school safely."
10491,Well done.

10495,Or people don’t want them?
10496,Who’s still afraid of the virus?
10497,Why aren't Pfizer/BioNTech or Moderna opening a factory in somewhere like Australia/Japan/ South Korea for both production capacity and distribution reasons?
10498,Sorry about the loooooooong delay in replying to this - I kept meaning to and then forgetting again ...
10499,I think he was increasingly getting ready to retire and saying as much because he used to work a full time job right up to when he stopped (and in practice this was well beyond an 8am-5pm medical job) as well as his thinking he wouldn't necessarily be able to bring 100% forever but I won't deny there wasn't some manoeuvring going on as well at the workplace from a few people going on as well (new arrival who despite his qualifications had other a lot of other places not wanting to work with him because he was more trouble than he was worth combined with the person who hired him having some sort of beef with my dad for reasons I've never really been able to fathom).
10500,"So, a combination of all those factors was part of the decision making process in determining when to leave before the workload and the hassle in general exceeded the trouble it was worth."
10501,"Yes, you could definitely frame it as jumping before being pushed but regardless, he wasn't going to stay for much longer either way so he went when he went in the end but I'd say it was his decision as it would have been +/- a few months no matter what."
10502,"I mean, for our purposes here, we can pretty quickly realize that American cities are MUCH larger than Australian ones."
10503,LA's metro population is half that of the entire country of Australia.
10504,The whole state of Victoria (same size as Minnesota) has less than half of LA's metro population.
10505,"Now, is this a major reason why Australia is doing far better than the US with COVID?"
10506,I don't know.
10507,But I definitely know that the US has cities that are much more densely populated and much higher populated than those of Australia and the statement (not yours) that Melbourne is more populated than LA is just nonsense.
10508,This is quite the tenses!
10509,Lookout!
10510,"I just had mine yesterday, arm pain was noticeably more sore than the first dose, and I was a bit sleepy today, apart from that nothing."
10511,"One of my co-workers worked a 12 hour shift after her second dose, no problems."
10512,Another said she was tired and that was it.
10513,"My girlfriend had low grade fever, swelling of lymph nodes, and a bit of swelling at injection site after her second dose (only arm pain after her first dose)."
10514,That’s a really weird definition.
10515,If people can work and date and see their families and go around without masks it’s normal.
10516,That’s what people care about and we want to know when that will happen.

10533,"for example shoveling money at vaccine manufacturing, striking deals early with producers and making sure that they produce in the US for the US market."
10534,The US (and UK) spent 7 times more per capita on supporting vaccine manufacturing than the EU.
10535,Which is part of the reason why the US (and UK) vaccination campaign is going so well while it's crashing and burning in the EU.
10536,"For it's size, the US vaccination campaign is going extremely well."
10537,I've heard it.

10546,Not enough people have received the vaccines for that to be plausible.
10547,Changing the number of cycles they do the test which previously lead to TONS of false positives is reducing the numbers how the number of cycles have been dropped by the WHO conmen.

10628,It was getting pretty difficult to do that with how many cases there were on top of all my other tasks that had to be done.
10629,Quite honestly there were many times where covid + people came in... both because I could not screen them (though my ex-coworker who was a lazy piece of shit had something to do with that) and a few times the covid + person came in even when we told them not to.

10903,"I get locking down at first until we understood what was happening but the original plan was to ""flatten the curve"" and just moderate the pace of the spread so the health system could deal with it."
10904,This somehow morphed into endless lockdowns and stressing out every time cases increased even though this was literally the plan initially.
10905,And then if you don't wear a mask you are literally killing people.
10906,The fatalities are concentrated in people age 65+ with health conditions and it has surprised me that these people keep dying.
10907,Like you think think that after 3 or 4 months of fatalities the same group of people that those people would then be extra careful.

10923,Even J&amp;J's one dose vaccine that had lower overall efficacy prevented 85% of all severe cases post 28 days shot (plus 100% post 49 days) and 100% of hospitalizations 28 days post shot even in places where the new variants are prevalent.
10924,The J&amp;J vaccine did target the same spike protein so that is a very good indication that Moderna and Pfizer's vaccine will still work very well for severe disease.

“For teacher unions to pretend that they don’t want to have in classroom sessions (despite the clear evidence that schools do not spread infections), because they want to protect minority students....is utter nonsense."
10995,"They are using race for their own benefit, and it’s leading to policy that harms these kids."
10996,"This is shameful and disgusting.”

11014,This is not meaningless.
11015,It is evidence that AZ is effective as a single-shot vaccine.
11016,I'm not suggesting that we use it that way.

11043,Does a pulmonary embolism count as an illness?
11044,Actually *thought* that I had COVID because I had shortness of breath and my O2 levels were in the 80s.

11058,People aren’t getting vaccinated at sufficient rates to make a dent in anything and it will be superfun to see how the virus mutates to resist mRNA vaccines.
11059,Man you need to learn about government areas.
11060,Greater Sydney has a population density of 430 sq km.
11061,"This contains a lot of national parkland, rural areas, etc."
11062,"The City of Sydney had a population density of 1,170 sq km."
11063,Actually true.
11064,This headline is inaccurate.
11065,There is no evidence to suggest that the new variants out of the UK and SA are evolving to avoid the vaccines.
11066,They merely have mutations prior to the vaccine being available in those areas that are beneficial to the virus’ ability to resist.
11067,"Theoretically speaking, if 100% of a population is vaccinated and a virus mutates  to overcome that vaccine’s ability to prevent infection, you can make the argument it’s evolving resistance."
11068,We see it in bacteria all the time.
11069,There is no evidence that’s what’s occurring.
11070,These are just mutations that happened before the vaccine rollout.
11071,Will your purchases breathe on you?
11072,?
11073,"While I think the swedish response is both efficient and balanced, this kind of cherry-picking single-variable argumentation isnt very useful."
11074,China has an engineer in charge (Xi Jinping has an engineering background).
11075,"Their default response is thus to attempt to control everything, but the upside is that there is a system and a process to manage COVID - no exceptions."
11076,"Whereas other countries with authoritarian leaders are focused on power networks, maintaining the status quo, and making money, which leads to a totally different outcome."
11077,You should write to the paper about it.
11078,What side effects?
11079,"For me, both of my shots were pretty mild (Pfizer, 38 y/o male with asthma)."
11080,"Fatigue and arm soreness starting about 4-5 hours after the injection, and feeling tired like I had a hangover the next day."
11081,No side effects past the 2nd day.
11082,How many reinfections are happening?
11083,Do you have a link?

11104,It’s terrible marketing at a time when we really need as many people vaccinated as possible.
11105,Absolutely.
11106,Probably around 30-35% without vaccines.
11107,People have to whine everywhere.I guess this is first time in many decades mass vaccination for adults happening in India.People are pretty happy to vaccinate kids &amp; babies without any fuss but when it comes to self they will think about side effects/rumours and in some cases outright arrogant.
11108,So much text just to avoid answering my question.
11109,"In addition to the funding channeled through the EU for vaccine development or production pre-financing, what is the breakdown of funding made available directly by EU national governments?"
11110,"The EU initiated the Covax project, while the US, Russia and China did not join the international cooperation in order to pursue their own geopolitical interests."
11111,That the UK took such a big role in Covax is primarily due to the large share of AstraZeneca distributed via Covax.

11129,We don’t know the reservoir host (many think it’s a bat) but it tends to pop up where people are on the outskirts of the jungle.
11130,It kills gorillas and other congregational apes possibly worse than humans so now everyone knows not to scavenge meat from dead gorillas anymore.
11131,A number of outbreaks in the 80s were people finding a # of dead apes and butchering them.
11132,When it does pop up It tends to burn itself out because of human reaction (we get really scared really quick).
11133,It’ll hit a village and just start killing people.
11134,Most people will shun that area (and threaten people who come from it).
11135,People have learned that it’s the caretakers who get sick so people have learned that caring for your sick family members is pretty much the most dangerous thing you can do.
11136,So some people are left with food to die while others receive good treatment if the outbreak is being professionally managed at that point.
11137,"The saying goes once your done treating a family for Ebola you carefully take out the bodies and burn the hut (or something like that, not that it happens just that you don’t want to be where someone has just died from Ebola)."

11257,Gotta say that most Australians aren't too worried about being 'trapped' on our island for the foreseeable future when we see the abject misery most other countries are going through.
11258,And you have a funny notion of what freedom is but I'll put that down to your fear and anger.
11259,"Living in Vic and experiencing a lockdown wasn't fun, but we're now reaping what was sown: long Sunday arvos sitting outside enjoying the sun and having a cold one with mates."
11260,"Again, hope you're ok. We're going awesome down here :)"
11261,It seems like each state has to have it's own mishap to fix these problems instead of learning from other states experiences from months ago.
11262,Gave false positives on an HIV test.
11263,The vaccine might still work.
11264,Absolutely!
11265,But we are not talking about that.
11266,"You asked why state level quarantine is not used everywhere, and I responded to explain."
11267,It wasn't a tribal response where I took sides about the overall pandemic or whatever.
11268,"I wasn't saying US is doing great, I wasn't saying US shouldn't lockdown, I was only explaining why it's harder to lock borders at some situations than others."
11269,Don't project more than that to my comment and try to make every discussion some weird tribal bullshit where to have to agree with everything and you're the enemy of you don't.
11270,"I didn't even say the border closures wouldn't be good, I just said they would be harder to implement!"
11271,I tested positive for COVID on Friday (1/29).
11272,"Since the beginning of this pandemic, catching COVID has been my biggest fear."
11273,"Heck, y'all can look through my post history on this sub and see that my mental health was drained by everything going on."
11274,"As soon as I felt my brain and mental health were starting to turn the corner in a positive direction, it turns out that I test positive."
11275,It sucks.
11276,I completely lost my taste and smell and now I have a slight sore throat.
11277,"Aside from that, I feel fine, I guess?"
11278,"I did have nasal congestion, an upset stomach, a few muscle aches, and a bad headache."
11279,My biggest worry is that I'm going to die.
11280,"I just turned 23, I've been losing weight since the 1st (360 -&gt; 336 now!"
11281,"), I've never been diagnosed with diabetes, high BP, etc."
11282,I don't smoke or drink.
11283,But I am definitely obese.
11284,And I know being obese doesn't help.
11285,It makes me feel as if I started my dieting too late..
11286,"I know it's rare for people in my age group to pass, but man..."
11287,I can't get that fear out of my head.
11288,":( It's like, what if I'm living my last days as I speak?"
11289,"My nurse asked me for my first day I was showing symptoms (Tuesday 1/26) and then told me I'll be able to leave the house ten days later (which puts me at Friday or Saturday,  I believe?)"
11290,That's the only thing that's giving me hope right now.
11291,"But at the same time, I've read posts of ""Well, you're not completely out of the woods."
11292,"You can still have a bad second round of it as soon as you start to feel better."""
11293,"If you made it this far, sorry if my post comes off as ""dooming"" or ""Fearmongering."""
11294,"Please believe me, I support neither of those."
11295,I'm just scared.
11296,:(
11297,"Yep, and NSW is doing the contact tracing because they weren't prepared."
11298,McGowan is a joke.
11299,A truly staggering revelation.
11300,This should be bigger news
11301,r/agedlikemilk
11302,"Strep throat is it’s own illness, though Covid can cause a sore throat."
11303,But if you think you have strep please go get antibiotics.
11304,Strep is bacterial and can get very serious without them.
11305,Covid still isn’t the only infection out there.
11306,We seem to be doing okay without measures being *THAT* extreme.
11307,"I fully support McGowan and his team, and the current mask mandate is sound."
11308,"Forcing a mask mandate when community transmissions are at 0 would only serve to create pushback from the public, who would then be less likely to comply with health guidelines in the case of an actual outbreak."
11309,"There is a fine line that the WA government walks, and I think they’ve been doing really well with keeping people safe, without going overboard."

11312,South korea has a higher population density and was infected earlier.
11313,They took less economic damage and had 1% of the death rate.
11314,"Am Australian, can confirm it is just like living in North Korea - best to not come her anytime soon (in particular any Americans reading this)"
11315,Littt
11316,I don't think that's a big factor.
11317,"Compared to US, sure, but compared to most of western Europe I don't think there is a difference."
11318,People in the UK aren't worried about secret police either and they've done terribly at managing Covid.
11319,"The British were largely in support of government restrictions, it problem was the government was far to slow and lax with them."

11321,During the Victorian lockdown there were exceptions for freight
11322,"I`ll fight my way through to the vaccine, if I have to."
11323,"That's not leadership, that's just passing the buck."
11324,"Sadly, there is no cure for stupidity"
11325,"A month in jail for each of them, and if they so much as stand in the way of someone going for a vaccine when they get out, back in for a year."
11326,"Ok, if that's true it needs to stop."
11327,"If you are working in quarantine, it needs to be your only job."
11328,You need to be paid enough that you don't need a second job.
11329,You shouldn't be in contact with lots of random people.
11330,Same deal with the South Australian guy working in a pizza shop.
11331,"Whole city had to lock down there, too."
11332,The production lines are completely different and can't simply be switched out.
11333,"&gt;	Many countries have had longer lockdowns than Australia, mostly with good to excellent compliance."
11334,"The fact that some of these countries have not technically left lockdown in month, yet are operating as if they have leads me to believe this is false."
11335,The virus might be real in Australia but its a liberal hoax in America.
11336,"It was a huge deal in Australia, the Australian government tried to take the WA state govt to court over the border closures"
11337,"After the shit show of the last 4 years of the supposedly 'more advanced' corners of human society, how do I get your enthusiasm for people?"
11338,3 million dead Americans.
11339,76 million dead people.
11340,"They aren't going close petrol stations anyway, what's the logic there?"
11341,Refuel now so you don't have to once the 'rona gets around?
11342,But it could already be spreading and your making it worse....
11343,If the US had state wide lockdown and a good response they would have gotten on top of this months ago.
11344,But you are still clearly not ready to here that there are solutions for this issue.
11345,Excellent news!
11346,If it’s imported most likely from India but it could be made by a facility in Brazil.
11347,And here I thought -I- was a movie nut.
11348,I'm still lost with a lot of what you said.. but I appreciate a good rant.
11349,"And I'd have to agree, haven't seen a lot of sexism as a woman."
11350,But I've really only been playing on here for a month now.. so time will tell..
11351,They do second stage now is only people over 65 and  those with chronic illness   You can read more about what categories of people are planed to get the vaccine for each stage here on the official website.

11355,This didn't age well...Perth
11356,Lol.
11357,Someone deciding to dismiss tail risk because it makes them feel bad is exactly why humans are unable to respond to slow developing threats.
11358,"We think hope, emotion and luck is all we need."
11359,I was told by climate researchers 30 years ago there was a huge existential risk from climate change - but politicians dismissed it on the basis of the of magical thinking.
11360,I’m still waiting for a scientific critique of my position - other than whinging nobody has said anything cogent.
11361,"You're either a troll or completely ignorant so to answer your question yes, your death is more important than someone else, because for that other person all everybody has to do is rock up to the funeral, but for you we'd have a whole week long party to plan!"
11362,"Not to mention the average IQ would skyrocket to the point we could probably solve world hunger and cure cancer, so please don't refrain from doing so."

11371,Its been a month since my second dose.
11372,At the beginning all but two of us didn't want the vaccine.
11373,Now almost the whole unit has had at least the first shot.

11377,"Move then, fuck off to one of those countries who've contributed nothing to vaccine development and simply imposed total shutdown."

11379,It's in the corridor..
11380,Ain't no rule says a horse can't be a doctor
11381,I applaud you and your community.
11382,👏
11383,I’m wondering if there isn’t some vaccine hesitancy.
11384,Plenty of people have backed out prior to vaccination due to worry about vaccine side-effects.
11385,"Yeah, I guess they weren't really given an end date."
11386,[removed]
11387,No it doesn’t because that was never a significant source of false positives.
11388,Stop with the misinformation.

11399,Apples and pears when you compare with Australia whose largest airport is comparable to Blackpool and whose population is spread so thinly you could give each person a billion acres to play with.

11402,"Lower CT counts don’t change hospitalization rates, genius, and those rates follow the case count closely in age-graded cohorts."

11564,"As we close out all the restrictions, we will definitely need a Stimulus of funds for Mental Health Treatment/Research for all ages."
11565,"I do wonder if the older population is more resilient mentally since they have more experience in dealing with tragedy versus children, teens, and young adults."

11568,I think it's too early to tell yet.
11569,"We have a huge advantage of enough people following the rules, actually paying people a liveable amount to live off for months if their jobs had to stop ($1500 every two weeks I believe) and being able to stop movements between states and even regions within states."
11570,"Being an island barely came into it especially since international air travel and once exponential growth of a disease gets going, it increasingly ceased to be relevant (see Victoria's second wave which peaked at 700/day and needed several months of lockdown like conditions to eliminate)."
11571,"Also, the original source of this wave was a leak from hotel quarantine."
11572,Nice!
11573,The first summer without covid restrictions is going to be amazing
11574,"Vaccination is going smoothly in the EU, but since EU governments rejected vaccine nationalism, others have gotten their hands on the vaccines first."
11575,I still think around summer looks doable for my EU country at least.
11576,"We did get an estimate nationally the other day which said assumed AZ would do nothing to improve their delivery, and that they would stop delivering in June as that is as far as their schedule goes."
11577,It also ignores JJ and other potential extra vaccines completely.
11578,"Still, before July we would still vaccinate every old/at risk person."
11579,And a few more.
11580,It is not a big leap that is required before we are at 70-80% in June.
11581,"We are lagging behind now, but we are still at the start of a marathon, and I am not as pesimistic as you would think."
11582,The British variant is more infectious and more severe.
11583,i mean we shouldnt.
11584,Because coronaviruses can mutate fairly quickly
11585,I know all that.
11586,"However, absolutely everything in a Pharma production facility has to be documented appropriately and if asked by regulators you should have pretty convincing explanations for unexpected events."
11587,Why would AZ lie?
11588,What do I know and I don’t speculate.
11589,Other customers pay more would be one option.
11590,"If they provide evidence that they screwed up production, I’m satisfied."
11591,Probably didn't have enough faith.
11592,"I'm in California, where we closed beaches, parks and playgrounds, outdoor dining, and gyms."
11593,"I don't want to give my ""leaders"" more excuses to lock down."
11594,"Not only this, but holy crap people need to stop taking headlines seriously."
11595,About a week ago a random heart doctor said that nearly every person she sees that had COVID has heart problems.
11596,1) You don't go to a heart doctor with out suspicion of heart issues.
11597,"2) She's a heart doctor, of course the majority of her patients are going to have heart problems."
11598,3) Just because someone had COVID and has heart problems doesn't support a meaningful relationship for those people.
11599,Correlation does not equal causation.
11600,Yes.
11601,Some people have severe side effects.
11602,Yes that sucks.
11603,"But if these side effects were as common as some people seem to think, we would already be seeing masses of young healthy people with newly developed heart issues, which we aren't seeing."
11604,Stop getting all your info from the News.
11605,Read the science.
11606,"Do a little critical thinking, and sheesh people, stop fear mongering."
11607,I'd like to point out that we hit [20 million last Saturday](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-usa-cdc/u-s-cdc-says-41-4-million-doses-of-covid-19-vaccines-distributed-20-5-million-administered-idUSKBN29S0NO) and it only took a week to get another 10 million administered.
11608,This is the good kind of exponential growth people.
11609,I didn't think the Vaccine helped prevent the spread?
11610,This is good news if it is!
11611,Yesterday was actually 1245 and today is 1200 so it's down from yesterday.
11612,It's also down from the same day last week which was 1348.
11613,Seems like the deaths are finally starting to fall after a couple of weeks of cases falling.
11614,"No, I already understand those concepts better than you do, you're just misapplying them."
11615,"I understand that the most virulent strain will outlast the least virulent strain, but the existence of the vaccine and the presence of the vaccine in a person's system does nothing to make the virus more resilient or increase its spread."
11616,They are not learning to resist vaccines since they emerged before vaccines were rolled out.
11617,Maybe immunity.
11618,Not necessary.
11619,"As long as the existing vaccines have some efficacy against new variants, that buys us time to rapidly generate updated vaccines."
11620,There’s very low probability that new variants will completely render vaccines useless.
11621,"Even the worst variant so far, the SA one, reduces symptomatic efficacy to 50%."
11622,Public healthcare does not preclude the existence of private healthcare.
11623,"We can have free, universal coverage AND let people pay extra to get care of they’re not satisfied with the performance of their public doctor."
11624,"The private doctors would simply need to compete at a level that provides better care than the public ones, and they can charge a higher rate to do so."
11625,Then let people decide what they want.
11626,"UK medical regulator was very agile in approving the vaccines, getting preliminary data in studies in advance etc."
11627,"Thus the UK started up the process quicker, ironed put the early flaws, and hit a strong pace before other countries had even really started."
11628,We'll see other countries catch up in speed in a month or two.
11629,What I still don't understand is how Israel is light years ahead of everyone.
11630,Really impressive pace from them.
11631,This hints that the vaccine also reduces transmission
11632,"Well, I think in a real world study you are limited to observational."
11633,"You cannot have a real control group like in a clinical trial, with double-blind exc"
11634,No.
11635,"I mean - we aren’t great, but EU isn’t better."
11636,They sat on their ass and didn’t take action quick enough to be first to get vaccines.
11637,That’s basically it
11638,My cousin felt like he was too.
11639,"He died in Aug
At 31 - fit and avid athlete with no known comorbidities."
11640,We will be vaccinating over a million per day soon
11641,"It’s kinda like the NBA policy where they can’t swap jerseys, but have just been in close contact with each other breathing hard for 3 hours"
11642,You clearly have never experienced free chips and salsa in the bar area which Paul Revere himself spoke of on his midnight ride how dare you
11643,It is horrible.
11644,But just because it sucks doesnt mean its not true.
11645,When they first let out last year in March they said it would only be for two weeks.
11646,HA!
11647,I mean I don’t disagree with you.
11648,And my argument can be used for meat eating as well but I’ll make it anyway.
11649,This argument IMO is only valid in developed countries.
11650,"If food is scarce or leather / fur alternatives, I’m not advocating for them not using animals for survival."
11651,"However in developed nations, it is never necessary to own fur, and therefor I find it unethical."
11652,However I am aware that the same argument can be made for eating meat.
11653,I guess find what works for you and do your best minimize animal suffering
11654,How did this turn out?
11655,Did he remain totally asymptomatic otherwise?
11656,Just stop lmao what the fuck
11657,This is a calculated/assumed control group and not actual control group.
11658,"Without actual control group of a trial, there's a lot of uncertainty and variables to make a good comparison for efficacy."
11659,"Well, would you expect anything else?"
11660,I’m saying all is well after 10days seems a bit early to declare much of anything with regard to length of vaccine efficacy.
11661,"Looks good so far, but seems a bit early to make any claims."
11662,"Well yeah they did, everywhere is closed and your not allowed to see anyone you don’t live with other than if you have to go to work as an essential worker...basically go to work if you have to and that’s it!"
11663,Adults have much greater freedom and choice in this.
11664,No school district has made that official.
11665,It could years before there is a vaccine for children.
11666,It would be horrible
11667,My lady and I drove by a Chili’s the other night.
11668,It was PACKED (they are mostly ignoring all restrictions here in TX).
11669,We had a good laugh imagining what it would be like dying or ending up in the hospital because you just had to go to fucking Chili’s.
11670,At least make it a restaurant worth dying over if you’re going to take that risk.
11671,"Meanwhile, we have been doing takeout and drive-thru and haven’t eaten inside of a restaurant in a year."
11672,Dining inside honestly seems like one of the dumbest things that you can do right now.
11673,Or the entire EU for that matter.
11674,"We were actually paying people who couldn't work I think $1500 every two weeks for months, though which is something that was hugely different in Australia."
11675,Yeah true but i know from experience that a lot of colds viruses spread in early winter when the temperature first drops.
11676,At least in Canada.
11677,"I am not saying that, i guess you will be intensely disappointed waiting for that."
11678,During the bubonic plague countries tried to keep people at home and it made it worse because there was so much prolonged close contact.
11679,"I'm so tired of hearing the ""its because we locked down/didn't lock down hard enough"" excuse."
11680,Its a scared approach.
11681,How is that not child abuse?
11682,[removed]
11683,"And yet, Florida still has more deaths per capita than CA."
11684,121 vs. 100.
11685,65+ isn't the only risk factor.
11686,Preexisting conditions is a big one too.
11687,Who stopped you from waiting...echo chamber?
11688,the only benefit of COVID
11689,The EU never wanted to ban vaccine exports to the UK (or anywhere else).
11690,"The talk was always about monitoring exports to make sure they won't take from the EU stockpile because UK manufacturing is having issues, while claiming that EU production is having issues (like AstraZeneca did in December)."
11691,The EU is a trustworthy and reliable place for manufacturing.
11692,You aren’t going to die.
11693,"People in their 20s dying of Covid is incredibly rare, even morbidly obese people."
11694,Congrats on the weight loss so far and keep it up!
11695,He set that goal BEFORE he became president and before a single vaccination took place.
11696,"But yeah, you “win”."
11697,I mean the side effects are largely feeling like crap for 24-36 hours.
11698,I would happily do that at any moment if it meant getting back to my life.
11699,...and everywhere.
11700,I’m not sure I would call it a choice.
11701,I needed a job and I took one where I could find it.
11702,"I would call having a new job positive overall, but I would have preferred to not move away from my family and friends."
11703,"And I did lose a job because of the pandemic, hence the need to find a new one and move."
11704,I’m not really sure why you just assumed that this was some exciting thing that I sought out.
11705,It hasn’t been easy.
11706,I was more reacting to the comment that some people have coping skills.
11707,My point was that it is not 100% based on situations.
11708,I have healthy coping skills and I’m pretty resilient.
11709,"I’ve worked hard to seek out things like the headspace app to help, and have made sure to form routines so I’m not just all alone in my apartment all day."
11710,Apologize I looked at the wrong one.
11711,But besides that they are still the same so if the lockdown was not to prevent infections then what’s the purpose?
11712,Most countries that lockdown have the same outcome has countries that did not.
11713,"This post appears to be about vaccines, please see [our FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/wiki/faq#wiki_where_can_i_find_information_about_the_mechanism_and_progress_of_vaccines.3F) for answers to frequently asked questions regarding the COVID-19 vaccines."

11717,*
11718,"well how about vietnam, southkorea or japan"
11719,Moderna is reportedly working on vaccines for HIV and other viruses.
11720,This general approach to producing vaccines has a lot of promise and Covid is the first case of this kind of vaccine being produced at global scale.
11721,So it is actually pretty exciting.
11722,I think that maybe two things can be true at once here.
11723,"The first, is that the rise of specific mutations isn’t the greatest news."
11724,We should carefully monitor this and understand what it means.
11725,This isn’t fake news as maybe some would say.
11726,"The second is that the news of the mutations and the implications they bring *is* being over sensationalized by the media, as the media has been doing with every speedbump over the course of this entire pandemic."
11727,I think this is what people are a little sick of.
11728,"No, the mutations aren’t ‘fake news’ but really the headline that should be shared with the public is *vaccines still prevent severe illness from all known mutations thus far*."
11729,"If you have a jar of 1000 jellybeans and one green jellybean, it is disingenuous to center the story of the jellybeans around the colour green."
11730,"I think we get a little too wrapped up in the hopes of achieving the Hollywood ending to this story - a perfect vaccine where no one suffers ever again, celebration in the streets with the ewok song from ROTJ, the hero scientist who discovers the vaccine gets the girl - and any deviation from this is supposed to be a massive disappointing blow."
11731,"The reality, is that we’re going to move past Covid-19 and it’s not going to be as pretty as some would like."
11732,Mutations may sneak past our neutralizing antibodies but that doesn’t mean we are left protection-less.
11733,The vaccines still give our cells the handbook to fight this virus off.
11734,"Yes, we will all probably get a cough and stay in bed for a few days."
11735,"Yes, fewer but *some* will get really sick and require a hospital bed and even fewer than that will die - but they will be small enough %’s of the total that our hospitals will be able to handle it and life can resume as we knew it BC (before covid)."
11736,"It’s not pretty, it’s not Hollywood, but this is the trajectory that every respiratory virus travels on when it is exposed to a population for the first time."
11737,"Every respiratory virus mutates and evades neutralizing antibodies, but the damage done isn’t enough to shut down society every season."
11738,You asked when the last time I was in a school.
11739,So I told you.
11740,Cares act has money for upgrading ventilation and the code calls for 3 air exchanges an hour.
11741,"Yeah, you should push for it to be fixed, who else will?"
11742,You NYC teachers care more about your union and rubber rooms of unfit teachers than you care about your classrooms.
11743,That’s on you.
11744,You have had decades to push for basics like ventilation.
11745,Thats probably dependent on your employer.
11746,I turn my computer off at the end of the work day.
11747,I dont have my work email or teams on my phone.
11748,My employer has never told me they expect me to do so.
11749,Of course I make around average pay.
11750,If you make a high income I would guess that would be different.
11751,I’d gladly eat at one today.
11752,"I refuse to accept anything less than the exact same old normal as of 2019, except maybe people wearing masks *while sick*."
11753,The trials were set up to test symptoms.
11754,So that 95% efficiency for example is at preventing symptoms not necessarily transmission.
11755,Although early data from Israel does suggest it may stop transmission but nothing conclusive yet.
11756,So it could be that he's asymptomatic and tested positive.
11757,But yh not everyone is going to be protected.
11758,Vaccines aren't 100% effective so there's always a small chance
11759,"I don't think you know what the word ""goal"" means."
11760,A goal is supposed to be at least somewhat ambitious.
11761,"His ""goals"" haven't been."

11763,"For your first flu shot, you’re supposed to get two doses."
11764,"Thereafter, it’s just one."
11765,"Tetanus shots are a whole series, and then when you need a booster, it’s just one."
11766,It’s entirely possible the covid shot will be like that.
11767,Agreed!
11768,This is like the oxygen mask when a plane depressurizes.
11769,You first put the mask on yourself and then help those in need...
11770,Just had my first ever covid test.
11771,All I've heard up until now is how uncomfortable it is because they shove the swab so deep into your nose.
11772,My test wasn't like that.
11773,They swabbed close to the edge of my nostril.
11774,Did the test change?
11775,Or did they do it wrong?
11776,Here it seems like it’s 5.6% fatality rate https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-02483-2
11777,It sounds that way.
11778,And that's the most important thing.
11779,"Likely didnt think it was covid, especially with there being zero cases in his area."
11780,So many other illnesses present with similar symptoms.
11781,"If you don't like it, it doesn't mean you can stop people wanting the vaccine."
11782,"Everyone has a choice, doesn't mean you can stop someone else from making the choices they made."
11783,Westralia has been acting like its own country
11784,"Wait, I thought we had a free market."
11785,The number who rebelled against restrictions are a very small percentage of the population.
11786,"Plus, countries like the US and U.K. funded, researched, and manufactured the vaccine."
11787,[removed]
11788,I mean when I was in my 20's and 30's I went weeks or months without seeing my parents.
11789,I have not seen my elderly in-laws for months.
11790,Yeah it kind of sucks but is far from impossible.
11791,Nursing homes already have procedures in place for flu and other outbreaks which are dangerous for those residents.
11792,Why not test everyone that comes into contact with residents every day and/or completely cover them in PPE?
11793,I know dentists and doctors that are working every dealing with the public and are not getting sick.
11794,My point is that it is one thing to protect 100% of the population and another to protect 15%.
11795,We have awareness and prevention campaigns to protect other groups such as women and breast cancer.
11796,But somehow we can't do the same thing for Covid.
11797,Facts?
11798,That’s so last century..
11799,[deleted]
11800,I'm kind of curious on how cases are even able to escape quarantine.
11801,With your forced 14 day quarantine and a negative covid test i would of thought it's virtually impossible then for anyone to have covid when they leave quarantine and join the community?
11802,"Yeah, we are in agreement."
11803,It's a shame people won't get a vaccine that could save them.
11804,"Also, the whole ""95% effectiveness"" and focusing on the 5% - I could be wrong but aren't ALL the vaccines 100% against death and hospitalizations?"
11805,Only for a few months because the baby Eventually gets their own immune system .
11806,"Eh, no."
11807,"According to your own link tests per million:

US: 935,053

DK: 2,325,180


US ranks 19 in the world."
11808,DK ranks 7.
11809,Opinions and biasedness have different meanings in dictionary.
11810,That's why I initially said lets wait for a few more years when you all will be royally fucked as well just like the poor in this country.
11811,We shall have a good conversation then.
11812,Waiting for that day buddy.
11813,Till then you can stop asking questions to government as you are used to and agree with the status quo.
11814,Good life living for someone else.
11815,&gt;I’m becoming suspicious you have j&amp;j stock at this point lol.
11816,Why do you think this is about supporting J&amp;J?
11817,"I agree that, honestly, the numbers are not good."
11818,I'm saying that you can't simply turn a plant made to produce adenovirus vectors into one that produces mRNA vaccines.
11819,"The three you initially suggested (Moderna, Pfeizer, Novavax) are completely different from J&amp;Js - AZ isn't."
11820,"AZ isn't terribly effective either - the 90% number was a random obervation that one can hope is true, and if the new trials confirm it, that's excellent."
11821,J&amp;J is doing ENSEMBLE 2 to see if two doses improve outcomes.
11822,"If not, honestly, countries are better off relying on it as little as possible, but many might not have a choice, when time is working against them."
11823,AU and NZ need to stop bragging
11824,Are you guys going to be using AZ/pfizer vaccines

11826,[removed]
11827,Its almost like you didn't see what happened in Melbourne.
11828,Or Sydney.
11829,Or Adelaide.
11830,Or Brisbane.
11831,Or NZ.
11832,Curious but how was thus case able to escape quarantine.
11833,IIRC people have to spend 14 days in a hotel to quarantine and get a negative test before joining the community
11834,I think we're arguing the same thing.
11835,I am just saying it will be a shame people die who don't need too
11836,2nd Moderna shot is often associated with those kind of symptoms.
11837,It's not typically dangerous but people often need to take a day off work.
11838,"If you look in the phase III clinical trial results you can see what percentage of people had what kind of side effects, but the booster dose is trigger your immune system to create a strong protective response which creates some side effects."
11839,You're getting downvoted but it's true.
11840,"The point of all these measures isn't to stop all covid cases, it's to keep hospital capacity open and people from dying."
11841,All we need for that to happen is for the elderly and immunocompromised to be vaccinated.
11842,The Pfizer and Moderna vaccine trials were successful beyond our wildest dreams- 95 percent effective and of the few who got covid not a single one got it severely.
11843,"For young people it should be a personal choice, because by that time there will be virtually no risk of spreading it to an old person and causing serious illness."
11844,All the wealthy people that are getting it aren’t having to deal with getting sick while they are out enjoying their lives.
11845,I love wfh and am glad this gave me the opportunity to do so.
11846,However I am also lonely and want to see my friends and family.
11847,I do want the pandemic to end .
11848,Just because I want to stay home during work hours doesn't mean I am not desperate to get out and do normal things in my free time!
11849,Lmao thats why the us has gitmo
11850,Why should we use china for a benchmark in any situation.
11851,We know they aren't honest about numbers and they use draconian policies that are incredibly harmful to their citizens.
11852,Should we follow china in any human rights issue?
11853,"Just as there are places tbat locked down that had low feath rates, there are places that didnt lockdown that also had low death rates."
11854,You can't keep saying its because we didn't lock down hard enough.
11855,That argument is so weak and only results in tighter restrictions.
11856,Which means living for a year of this and trying no alternative to locking down.
11857,The WHO 2019 pandemic guideline didn't recommend lockdowns.
11858,Your views are based on bad science.
11859,There is an abundance of data suggesting there is no correlation between lockdown stringency and suppression of the virus.
11860,Yes some measures should be taken to protect the old and susceptible but closing society on a whole is insane.
11861,I'm not talking about the countries that haven't had to deal with the threat of a pandemic.
11862,I'm talking about countries that already have been in lockdown for a year and are really suffering do to it.
11863,Coronavirus is already there and there is no stopping it.
11864,So lift restrictions because they are doing more harm than good.
11865,"Australia cut itself off from the world, which nobody can go back in time and do."
11866,"Also, i don't buy into these death stats."
11867,"Deaths with covid19 are also counts (not always deaths from covid 19), at least in my country."
11868,And the tests themselves return a staggering amount of false positives
11869,Now says 1.6 million vaccinations yesterday.
11870,The numbers from the last few days tend to increase for a few days I guess as numbers are continually reported.
11871,California is 24th in cases per capita and 34th in deaths per capita...

Of course not allowing exports it's another matter lol, imagine if it was the other way around... oh we know, UK considered that move from EU a ""hostility"", while the UK has all vaccine production being hoarded for themselves."

11885,The tax argument is a dangerous one to make.

11887,The case in washington heights is partially due to the website being english only for a primarily spanish speaking community.

11893,I think hospitalizations will fall the fastest of all of the metrics because we're targeting vaccinations to the groups most likely to go to the hospital.
11894,This is what happened in Israel when they saw hospitalizations fall 60% after vaccinating about 30% of the population.
11895,"Fatalities will eventually drop as well, I think they will fall further because they are even further concentrated in the at-risk group."
11896,But it will take longer because of the time lag between illness and death.
11897,I really want to see everyone's reactions when hospitalizations and fatalities fall by 50-75% across the country and continue to trend downwards.

11899,This didn’t age well
11900,I'm sorry let me clarify.
11901,"Indefinitely, adverb, to a very great degree; immensely."
11902,Don't think so.
11903,And now it looks like the rumoured 4m AZ vaccines that went from the EU to the UK didn't happen either.
11904,Literally was just a small batch flown to the US.
11905,The EU hadn’t even approved the vaccine.
11906,The rest have been produced in the US.
11907,"The EU has succeeded in convincing its citizens, to blame America and the Brits for everything going wrong in their lives."
11908,Doesn’t it feel different when coming out of echo chamber to see different opinions from people?
11909,"Judging by the website USA tests more per capita then Denmark so you that was pretty wrong

11910,"The previously unreported lobbying efforts underscore that even after the Trump administration spent billions helping drug makers develop Covid-19 vaccines, it not only dismissed states’ concerns about the help they would need to roll them out, but actively undermined their efforts to press Congress to get the funding they needed."
11911,I usually get a cold every year between august and December.
11912,Nothing this year
11913,I completely respect your opinion.
11914,"I don't think this situation has a clear 'correct' answer, everyone needs this vaccine and there isn't enough to go around."
11915,It's just an awful situation for the human race as a whole.
11916,"They can try to find each sects leaders, but it'll do nothing."
11917,That person has to make a public edict in order for a change to happen.
11918,Is it possible you don't understand how much power a single leader has over the entire group (there is no committee)?

12007,"I look forward to the day when we have excess vaccines and nothing to do with them, because everyone that wanted one got one."
12008,Okay sir.

12016,Has America ever used vaccines produced in Europe?

12018,They certainly don't allow exports but that's another matter.

12020,It's even better when you consider that only about 75% of the population is eligible to receive it i.e.
12021,adults.

12023,The only problem with that is that there are people who medically can’t get the vaccine.

12025,So what’s up with this congressman who’s tested positive a couple weeks after getting his second shot?
12026,"And yes I know this happened once before, and yes I know I posted and asked about it then, too."
12027,What are the statistical odds of this happening to two different congressmen?
12028,"That’s such a small cohort, the odds have to be astronomically high?"
12029,"Based on the responses I got last time it happened, and what I’ve read about the pandemic, the possible explanations boil down to the following."
12030,- You’re not fully protected until 2-3 weeks after the 2nd shot.
12031,So there’s a 6-8 week window after getting the first shot that you can still catch it.
12032,He got infected then.
12033,- It prevents severe symptoms but may not fully neutralize replication.
12034,"Therefore the whole “it doesn’t prevent spread, just sickness” thing."
12035,- He became infected by a variant.
12036,The variant escapes antibodies and the existing vaccines are less effective theory.
12037,- His test was a false positive test and he doesn’t actually have it.
12038,- 95% effective he’s the 5% theory.
12039,Have I missed any possibilities?
12040,Um also not very correct.
12041,2009 swine flu infected more than a billion/up to half worlds pop
12042,Race has absolutely zero to do with the vaccine rollout in nyc.
12043,I'm a resident.
12044,"Here's the process: you go on the website, you enter your zip code, and you take whatever you get."
12045,"Whites get there's in ""Latino areas"", Latinos get there's in ""Black areas"", Asians get there's in ""Bengali areas."""
12046,Race has absolutely nothing to do with where you get your appointment.
12047,"Frankly, arguing that certain races should ""stay in their neighborhoods"" is profoundly racist"
12048,Yeah it will be a big issue.
12049,There won’t be any way to verify who has had it or not and there will be lax requirements for those who have taken the vaccine.
12050,"&gt;Didn't the government stated 

in the article 

&gt;according to an SBI research report."
12051,"So this is not something the GoI said

Nevertheless, lets wait till August then for the 300 million target?"
12052,We still have 200 days to go.
12053,"We are doing now 0.4 million a day, reaching 2,3 million a day is not a stretch, imo."
12054,"Yes, until it’s been proven that you cannot spread the virus when vaccinated (likely that you can’t, but unproven right now), spread is reduced significantly or the most vulnerable populations are fully vaccinated."
12055,Once any of those three scenarios hit then mask mandates should go away
12056,The European Union is restricting exports.
12057,"We don’t care to invest in anything other than houses, banks, mines and farms here so developing our own vaccine is out of the question."
12058,"I agree with you there, such a stupid country living on dumb luck."
12059,The article doesn't go into much detail.
12060,"The site was shut down ""as a precaution."""
12061,"My guess is the protestors weren't breaking the law, but given the types, I think they closed it down to bring in back-up."
12062,"Worried about a confrontation, they close the gates and wait for more people."
12063,"The vague ""Several LAPD officers also responded to the scene"" doesn't really tell us much, but given no arrests you'd think they just came as extra protection as opposed to responding to a specific illegal act, but who knows."
12064,Another climbdown from the EU.
12065,How humiliating.
12066,Does it stay the spoiled color if doses are left out and spoiled but then put back into the fridge?
12067,Today I realized fake vaccine cards will be an issue.
12068,Damn
12069,Actually Australia has a pretty surprising problem with Vitamin D deficiency ironically in part due to skin cancer awareness/sun safety campaigns.
12070,"I'm not against Russian or Chinese vaccines if they are approved by EMA, but I doubt they can be approved in time to be of any use."
12071,"Unless the next candidates on the EU's list fail, there should be enough vaccines by the summer."
12072,It's higher than 10% I think.
12073,"Unfortunately I cannot read Hebrew and the Isrealis don't seem to publish their data in English, so I cannot make senseof that graph."

12093,Thank you all so much.
12094,I can’t find the hospitalisation rate for over 60.
12095,It’s 20% for over 80.
12096,"For the 60, it should be significantly lower but probably not as low as 5%."
12097,Though people are typically hospitalised in the 2nd or 3rd week
12098,People who aren’t sick tend to not get tested
12099,The US administered more than double the vaccines than canada and the EU comined.
12100,It's rising dramatically.
12101,We are absolutely killing it compared to the rest of the world.
12102,It's perfectly legal in some states to intentionally run people over *if* you feel that your life is in danger.

12108,Why comment on an article you didn’t read?
12109,"These people had the nerve to co-opt the ""my body, my choice"" slogan."
12110,And then they forcibly deny other people's choice to take the vaccine.
12111,why would you say this?
12112,The US vaccine rollout is an amazing success so far...
12113,"Does this being a ""broad spectrum"" antibody against coronaviruses that it could help cure the ""common cold"" as well?"
12114,"That would be an additional, and huge, win."
12115,[removed]
12116,[removed]
12117,"Yes, I edited above for that mistake."
12118,I mean I get that but... there's a global pandemic on and money is literally not a consideration.
12119,We could have started building factories to produce the top 10 or 20 vaccine candidates back in June.
12120,The fact that the whole world is waiting on handful of these factories is kind of ridiculous.
12121,There are issues with that assessment.
12122,"Correct if I’m wrong, but they were not able to prove that the reduced dose accident actually led to a true increase in efficacy."
12123,Wasn’t it a small sample size and there were confounding factors that may have led to the increased efficacy?
12124,I don’t recall them sorting that out officially.
12125,Sigh.
12126,Cashiers can't possibly work in any other assignment within a grocery store?
12127,There's nothing else to do in a grocery store but work in a cashier position?
12128,"Even as a cashier, there's no other shift where they could be assigned but where the hazard to them or to customers might be lessened, such as a less-busy time of day, or a lane where fewer customers pass through per day (i.e."
12129,"not the ""1-10 items"" lane)."
12130,"No way to adapt, no way to mitigate the risk in any foreseeable way."
12131,A pandemic and the availability of some employees that are vaccinated changes nothing in the equation.
12132,"Full steam ahead, straight into that avoidable iceberg that might lay in the path."
12133,"I'm saying the employer needs to work with the employee to best try to balance the greater risk to themselves, the customers, and other employees because some employees chose not to get vaccinated and some did."
12134,That's it.
12135,It's not rocket science.
12136,"I'm saying where there is flexibility within the workplace to strike a balance between that freedom of choice and the impacts, you exercise it."
12137,You adapt.
12138,To do less is to be irresponsible to everybody involved.
12139,"I've worked for decades and have on occasion been reassigned to do different jobs, given different tasks from my usual routine, etc."
12140,It happens.
12141,It is challenging but sometimes that kind of adaptability is part of the job.
12142,"Frankly, my job in the last year has been turned upside-down because of the pandemic and it has been insanely stressful."
12143,But I'm committed to completing the requests my employer has made of me despite the high level of difficulty.
12144,"Whether I can sustain it, I don't know, but I'm trying."
12145,"My employer also asked employees to make certain contract-related sacrifices so that they didn't have to lay people off, which I and others have also agreed to."
12146,We're all working on this problem.
12147,"Maybe I'm out of touch with reality because I'm fortunate to still have a job, but maybe the willingness I and my fellow employees have for some give-and-take with our employer in this situation is why."
12148,"I just think it's unfair for people to have the freedom to choose whether or not to get vaccinated (which I truly believe they should have), but the employer to have no ability to adapt the workplace to that choice."
12149,"Some businesses have less flexibility, especially smaller ones."
12150,I understand that.
12151,"If that's your point, I accept it."
12152,"You roll with what you've got, but to give no thought to what's actually possible in a given workplace isn't right."
12153,"If by “infection” you mean case numbers, they are only “virtually the same” because Denmark test up to 5x more per million than Sweden and the US."
12154,The difference is very clear when comparing deaths.
12155,Nothing a few high pressure water hoses and truncheons can't fix.
12156,"My son is headed to collage in the fall and we are also optimistic that it will be relatively ""normal"" with access to the vaccines."
12157,Good luck.
12158,australia is embarrassing.
12159,i feel bad for you guys that live there.
12160,Get some vaccines going so you don't lock 2 million people down because of one guy....
12161,"To start with I personally think it is perfectly ok to question the fatality numbers in the UK and other countries, this has been a point of contention since the beginning."
12162,I am not a conspiracy theorist or whatever but I have never understood how you could count these fatalities with such certainty given that a vast majority of the people that died had multiple other serious health conditions.
12163,"That said, why do you think the UK's method of counting fatalities within 28 days of a positive test overinflates the number?"
12164,When they switched to this method from the previous one the number of fatalities actually decreased.
12165,"Even elderly people with health conditions can continue to live for many years and if they get covid and it cuts their life short this is arguably a ""covid fatality"" even if they were going to die one or two years later anyway."
12166,"Another way to visualize this whole thing is through ""excess morbidity"" which is deaths that are above the statistical norm."
12167,https://fingertips.phe.org.uk/static-reports/mortality-surveillance/excess-mortality-in-england-latest.html
12168,Time to get born again.
12169,"I don’t think the US or Brazil will ever have adequate contact tracing, lockdowns and positive case quarantines."
12170,Sure it’s not a perfect analogy.
12171,Still doable with a bit of retooling.
12172,If you are trying to convince me that one drug manufacturers facility’s are so vastly different from three major competitors that with a few weeks retooling they can’t produce a competitors drug or vaccine I think we are going to disagree lol.
12173,It’s why they can all pump the same generic the moment the patent expires.

12183,Be careful with that one.
12184,It’s a lot of guess work.
12185,And even if it is accurate - estimates are that it is like 3 or 4% more “deadly”.
12186,I would hold until more evidence is found.
12187,Boris Johnson over shared with that information.

12203,People won't like this answer but....yes.
12204,blacks and latinos have shown skepticism about the vaccine and are less likely to get it.

12225,*
12226,No kidding.
12227,But the infection is still virtually the same.
12228,France has had multiple lockdowns and we see it has done nothing but delay.
12229,South Africa had one of the strictest lockdowns and they have the most cases in Africa.
12230,The problem with the lockdown strategy was that they did not consider structure of society and local cultures and geography.
12231,For instance Chinas lockdowns would be viewed has extreme in the west but it worked.
12232,While most of the world would have a hard time to pull it off.
12233,"While Australia and New Zealand are geographically isolated, so they had control over anybody that entered."
12234,Most of the world does not have that luxury.
12235,"So far, 0 of any of the vaccinated trial volunteers ended up in the hospital, so the odds are really good that you won't either."
12236,They're in the second tier of vaccines.
12237,"They aren't nearly as good as the mRNA ones, but through multiple trials in different countries, they work well enough."
12238,"They're virtually 100 percent effective at stopping moderate and severe cases, and preventing hospitalization/death."
12239,"They're less effective at preventing people from catching/spreading the virus, especially with older people who typically have problems with inactivated virus vaccines."
12240,And life goes on...
12241,Lol yes.
12242,I meant 'not cold'.
12243,It's may be that [latitude is also very important](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32599103/) in determining transmission rate.
12244,[deleted]
12245,Doesn't recent data from Israel show that the people who have gotten the vaccine are much less likely to spread the virus?
12246,What question did I avoid namazi?
12247,"Still early, since the mass inoculation phase won't start for at least two months."
12248,Better to be prepared like Germany and build out and staff your sites in advance than be a Trump and have 20 million unaccounted for vaccines somewhere because the last mile distribution pipeline is nonexistent.
12249,I meant there infection rate is still fairly high.
12250,If you lockdown then open up to lockdown again then what is the point?
12251,It’s useless to lockdown unless your trying eliminate the problem but nobody has came up with a plan besides waiting for vaccines and in this case the Europe is in a worse position then the US in terms of vaccine procurement
12252,"Frankly I've always lived a fairly, um, reserved life, with very little ever allocated to ""entertainment budget,"" and with earlier travel, I have friends all over the place and we don't get together NORMALLY in person."
12253,"So on one hand, it's not much of a loss to me not to go to shows or live music or restaurants, since I never did much of that (though it's been long enough now I'm starting to miss the little I did)."
12254,"On the other, it's actually EASIER to get together with distant friends, since everyone is stuck online and we don't also have to coordinate travel."
12255,I actually have more of a social calendar now than before covid.
12256,"As well, working from home means I have no more stress of commute or tension with coworkers."
12257,"I do NOT like being watched, or having people over my shoulder, but in an open office, that's constant."
12258,"I do not like noise when I have to concentrate, but good luck in an open office."

12268,But im confused then as to why for example Johnson and Johnson is just now coming out with their own vaccine?
12269,Wouldn’t it be better to spend time and resources manufacturing a working product than researching the development of your own?
12270,"Assuming none of the variants blow up in the US I’d say most government mandated restrictions will be lifted by September, with the possible exceptions of masks and international travel."
12271,"Some states will keep masks longer due to the uncertainty of what will happen next Winter but by next Spring, they probably won’t be mandatory anymore."
12272,They more than likely won’t have a legitimate reason to enforce them anymore at that point.
12273,Yes so masks and distancing would still apply even after fully vaccinated
12274,"It’s fair to assume that if a vaccinated person was exposed to covid, they would have a substantially reduced ability to spread the infection."
12275,"Their infectious period, assuming they’re in the percentage of people who do get symptomatic infections, would presumable be shorter as well."
12276,"But, we do not have supporting data for the covid vaccines to prove this yet."
12277,"We should have it soon, but it is unlikely vaccinated people can spread covid."
12278,"If your friend got vaccinated a week ago, he may not have had time for full immunity to develop yet."
12279,"I believe Pfizer is two weeks out from the second shot, not sure about Moderna."

12283,oops
12284,mutation goes brrrr
12285,Conservative republicans don't care about the rest of the world.
12286,Some couldn't even point out where Australia is.
12287,EU never signed a contract saying shipment  of initial doses of any vaccine currently approved in Europe should come from either US or UK.
12288,Ergo there are no orders that are 'due' to be sent from either place.
12289,"Even the EU commissioner has now acknowledged this

 Not sure why you remain convinced otherwise."
12290,Just seems like an absurd game to me that cannot be won.
12291,"You know it spreads, you see it here- thought it was just gone and kaput."
12292,But- *it comes back*.
12293,Shutter everything and hit the nuclear button in response.
12294,Guess what?
12295,It *will* most likely come again.
12296,The lockdown didn't eliminate it.
12297,It came back.
12298,"Guess it might work this time though, right?"
12299,Again- just seems like a silly fools errand.
12300,They were exposed before receiving the vaccine
12301,&gt;16 out of the 317 infected were hospitalised; that’s 5% hospitalisation rate among the infected.
12302,They started the vaccine campaign by vaccinating the elderly who 1) have a much higher likelihood of being hospitalized with COVID-19 and 2) are less likely to make a good response to vaccines.
12303,So the hospitalization rate of people who have been vaccinated will only start to look better as time goes on.
12304,But it takes a few weeks after the final shot for the vaccine to be fully effective.
12305,Just a bunch of hangovers.
12306,[deleted]
12307,I don’t understand why international travel is still happening
12308,Which is kind of insane.
12309,It should not be controversial to want your life back.

12346,"&gt;“These co-infections can generate combinations and generate new variants even more quickly than has been happening,” said the study’s lead researcher Fernando Spilki, a virologist at Feevale University in Rio Grande do Sul state."
12347,"&gt;“It would be another evolutionary pathway for the virus,” Spilki added."
12348,&gt;New variants bring the risk of greater transmissibility and possible resistance to vaccines currently being developed.

13088,"If you read the interview with the AZ CEO, he claims that the EU application was late, but they went ahead even though they and the EU knew it was a difficult and was a ""super stretch goal""."
13089,We don't have the correspondence between AZ and EU - it would be very interesting to check that.
13090,"Everything in the contract talks about ""reasonable best efforts"" - clearly a very weak promise."
13091,Also note that making vaccines is not like manufacturing widgets.
13092,It's a biological process which is very difficult to get correct and to improve yields.
13093,"It's quite possible that if everything had gone right, the doses would have been delivered."
13094,Normally factories take many months to build up to full capacity.
13095,The late order by the EU has not helped here.
13096,Also note that AZ failed to deliver a much larger fraction of the doses it promised to the UK than it has to the EU.
13097,There were problems in getting the factories working in both cases.
13098,"No, I don't have the breakdowns, that's why I'm asking."
13099,But even without the breakdowns I know that the funds channeled through the EU are only part of the total public funds spent on vaccine development by EU countries.
13100,"Thus, the comparison you cite is not correct."
13101,It's part of an anti-EU campaign of the British media and social networks.
13102,stop anthropomorphizing a virus.
13103,I understand.

13140,So glad for their safety.
13141,The virtue signalling here is real
13142,We have vaccinated more than 15k nationwide.
13143,Quebec alone has received (and used up) 238k vaccine doses.
13144,How is that false?
13145,"If restrictions are relaxed, more vulnerable people will succumb to a disease that they can be saved from."
13146,"Care about people a little bit, why don't you?"
13147,"To be fair, the UK has made huge steps to provide the Oxford vaccine to the rest of the world, even though they don't export it directly."
13148,"This was 3 months after the UK ordered them, the EUs doses are made in the EU and this plant had issues."
13149,What a gift to developing nations to even get to participate in this without contributing financially.
13150,Salty.

13159,i don't know how they'll vaccinate all of Brazil given Bolsonaro's denialism.
13160,This is a very difficult question to answer.
13161,"First of all, does a vaccine prevent infection or symptoms?"
13162,"If it's the latter, than this strategy is already borked."
13163,"Second, the target group is just too damn large."
13164,How do you priorize fairly inside this group ?
13165,"The contrary strategy has the benefit of working even if the vaccine is not preventing infections and providing us with an easily identifiable (and let's be honest, easily manageable), reasonably small target."
13166,I lost 1.5 years of my college experience.
13167,My friendships have been damaged.
13168,I'm gonna still sleep well at night knowing that I and many others sacrificed those things to save lives.

13174,“overhyped” in the sense that if you get it you have a death sentence which is only the case for an extremely small percentage of people
13175,At this rate Israel won’t be a good guide for us on how vaccines reduce figures in locked down populations after events like this.

13190,Are they being tested though?
13191,There was a surprising study in Germany that showed spread among young children that had been missed because they just weren’t tested.
13192,How deeply sad.
13193,There is absolutely no scientific evidence that any variant will evade the vaccines.
13194,Somewhat reduced efficiency is way different than vaccines don't work.
13195,"Anyone implying so, including news outlets, is spreading misinformation that has no scientific backing."
13196,"There is also no evidence that they are actually ""new."""
13197,They were just recently sequenced.
13198,Could have been everywhere for months.
13199,Our current wave in the US could contain infections from many variants.
13200,"The people not talking about a summer with fewer restrictions generally want this to continue, at least subconciously."
13201,"I think because they find the thought of going back to normal, even if justified, terrifying."
13202,It's a kind of PTSD.
13203,Wow!
13204,Y'all are lucky!
13205,I can't get an appointment anywhere within 2-3 hours of the major city I'm in.
13206,And that's looking for appointments anytime between now and April.
13207,I just got word they opened up more appointments but the website crashed everytime I finished selecting a time and entering my info.
13208,"Now all of the appointments are gone, and I'm stuck waiting until they release more."
13209,It's been like this for weeks.
13210,Pharmacy websites do the same.
13211,It's incredibly frustrating.
13212,"So while some parts of the US clearly have it together, this process is still massively inefficient.."
13213,"Ok, so say ""no one is 100% safe until everyone is safe."""
13214,Its considerably more accurate and less inflammatory.
13215,I’m going back to normal this summer regardless of anything.
13216,Y’all have fun though 😘
13217,Case and point
13218,"We're going for herd immunity by 2022 whether everyone gets the vaccine or not, and whether anyone likes it or not."
13219,NJ?
13220,Yikes.
13221,Too close for comfort.
13222,Doesn’t mean I don’t care about Covid (I care about myself) but young people are losing so much so older comfortable people can sit on zooms and enjoy their family.
13223,They don’t care about younger generations at all.
13224,Ok be a hypocrite considering you were very invested in my life a few seconds ago lol.
13225,Stay locked up until 2022 idc I already study public health and I think it’s stupid to social distance when deaths are gone.
13226,Multiple experts have the said the same
13227,Question: Where the fuck do they get the vaccine from?
13228,"In Europe, people are questioning whether vaccine is real or just fake news because there are only a few who got vaccinated."
13229,Pay me 😍😍
13230,I think it’s more the case that these sorts of rates are what you’d normally expect for the first few months of a vaccination program.
13231,"The outliers (Israel, US, UK for example) did extraordinary things to speed it up."
13232,UK and US invested crazy amounts of money at risk in some unusual novel vaccines.
13233,That could easily have gone wrong with £100s of millions spent and no vaccines.
13234,It turned out well.
13235,"Supply isn’t the only thing obviously, the UK‘a success is also due to the organisation of the NHS (and the US’s despite the complete lack of federal organisation), but the approach to the supply side has been very new and has clearly made a big difference."
13236,Flu shots are around 50% effective.
13237,The J&amp;J is perfectly fine.
13238,Ha.
13239,"Those pesky northern Cornish, will they ever learn?"
13240,Wait now a sources credibility matters.
13241,You're posting CDC links everywhere want to speak of their track record?
13242,You don't get it both ways you know that right?
13243,One would expect the IFR to be lower for India: their population is younger than Western countries and their obesity rate is lower.
13244,"Oh, so you're projecting now."
13245,Okay.
13246,[removed]
13247,No one is safe until everyone is safe.
13248,Makes sense.
13249,As a Brit in group 4 for vaccines I don’t agree.
13250,This strategy has quite a lot of merit.
13251,"There is plenty of evidence that 1 dose of vaccine is well over 50% effective, maybe as high as 80-90%."
13252,So it’s better to double the number getting that protection and get as many people as possible vaccinated.
13253,I should be getting my vaccine in the next fortnight and I’ll be able to relax a little bit for the first time in months.
13254,Doesn’t seem all fixed.
13255,"Norway has more than one million doses scheduled by April, now the latest plan is 800k by October."
13256,Hopefully the numbers will be improved.

13270,thats a true slogan...
13271,Social distancing as in not gathering with your friends and family?
13272,Bit more than an inconvenience for most people.
13273,"If you’re referring to social distancing as in 2m apart from strangers (which is actually physical distancing), then sure an inconvenience"
13274,"A lot of people are sitting home for months, on Reddit, telling everyone else not to kill grandma."
13275,"If they actually ventured out, they'd see that grandma and grandpa are out at restaurants."
13276,Cool so you wanna social distance in the USA bc people in Africa aren’t vaccinated jw
13277,Wouldn't surprise me if this is in most states right now.
13278,We don't test what variant every positive case is and if its more contagious there are more than the handful being called out.

13280,"If Amazon were delivering the jabs, I’d expect my first dose to be thrown over my garden gate and the second to be dumped in my wheelie bin (on collection day)."
13281,You cannot prove those who are unvaccinated are a threat to others as well.
13282,We can’t just assume they are infected 24/7/365
13283,Makes no real sense to me at least.
13284,How fast you're currently vaccinating people doesn't tell you anything about where you are now in the stage of the epidemic.
13285,Israel's at blinding speed but can't open up just yet.
13286,India's (semi-intentionally) a little bit slow and we're practically open already.
13287,"Because Israel is just coming out of peak pandemic, while India's been going down for months now."
13288,What’s their exit strategy?
13289,Probably vaccinate close to the entire population with a wide array of 90% effective vaccines on the market.
13290,Once’s that’s done open up to other countries with similar vaccine standards and live life.
13291,Yes their may be community transmission but it’ll hard to spread if the entire country is vaccinated.
13292,Serbia is administering the equivalent of 400k shots a day.
13293,I don't remember Serbia being known for its queueing habits or its efficient healthcare.
13294,Whos getting the 10k 2nd doses?
13295,No-one got the 1st dose three months ago?
13296,Or is there exceptions for certain people?
13297,Yes.

13301,Apparently people vaccinated will still need to get negative pcr tests to be able to travel.
13302,That's about £150 \* 2 for British citizens (excuse me for not chcking out other countries).
13303,Surely if the vaccine works then there should be no need for these tests and travel should re-open.
13304,"Here's a country by country breakdown of the figures:

13305,The UK and USA were clear in their intentions to the vaccine manufacturers from the start.
13306,This allowed them to set up production lines for different contracts.
13307,The EU deciding to block exports this late due to its own mistakes is a completely different scenario.
13308,Yep.
13309,Now she doesn't care of a bunch of kids get covid and die and doesn't care that the kids are gonna infect everyone in the house.
13310,With a virus so infectious it makes it hard to understand how 25% of a population can have it and not instantly infect the rest.
13311,I am happy that the serious cases there are not that high.
13312,While I do agree with parts of what you say there are also people who can't take vaccines.
13313,We have to worry about them as well.
13314,In time we will know how much you can spread it with the vaccine too.
13315,"&gt;That's actually not true, at least in Scotland where the proportion of pfizer - astrazeneca vaccines is public knowledge 75% of the vaccines administered so far have been pfizer (about halfway down the page)

13332,"As a high schooler, the workload is massive and very hard to stay on top of."
13333,There is also zero social interaction and no sports or extra curricular activities.
13334,It’s not fun for us and it’s hard.
13335,I’m glad your child is doing well but they’re only in 2nd grade.
13336,Remote learning is obviously going to be much easier for a 10th grader than a 2nd grader.
13337,"&gt; The main vaccine they are using is the AstraZeneca one

That's actually not true, at least in Scotland where the proportion of pfizer - astrazeneca vaccines is public knowledge [75% of the vaccines administered so far have been pfizer](https://www.travellingtabby.com/scotland-coronavirus-tracker/) (about halfway down the page)"
13338,The current limiting factor is number of vaccines.
13339,"If you had two vaccines, would you rather give them both to one person or one to two people."
13340,They think you'll save the most lives with the latter.
13341,"They will give second doses eventually though, at most 12 weeks from the first."
13342,"And the AZ vaccine, which account for most of their supply, has been proven to not just work, but even has increased efficacy with the longer delay."

13355,"It's a beautiful thing, isn't it?"
13356,Is there any info on how many of those were done in England and in Scotland?
13357,"I mean, did we really think sticking a swab all the way up your nose was the only way."
13358,"Not a doctor, but I ventured to guess that if it is up your nose, it’s in your mouth also."
13359,Funny..If Oxford didn’t licence the vaccine then how do even vaccinate your own people?
13360,That still wouldn't make it too early to build out mass vaccine sites.
13361,Having them built and ready to go ahead of time will make things go smoother when they do have the supply of vaccines to support them.
13362,I think setting them up and staffing them before the vaccines actually get there could only be a good thing.

13405,Pretty much every time in modern history that a novel pathogen has started spreading we've taken urgent measures to contain it.
13406,"We didn't just let SARS, Ebola, etc."
13407,"go wild because ""safety from pathogens is an absurd notion""."
13408,The problem is that covid is the most difficult one to contain probably since the Spanish flu; our current measures would have utterly crushed SARS or Ebola but they aren't even enough to keep up with this.
13409,I'd be a lot more interested in a breakdown of the reasons for refusal.
13410,I manage a staffing team across three sites and uptake it approximately 60%.
13411,"Some reasons are medically valid, some reasons were based on personal belief."
13412,"It's not worth replying to such an ignorant post, but I have a few minutes of free time."
13413,"The vilification of the woman who returned and had several negative tests, the person in the pizza restaurant, and now this person shows the true nature of the posters."
13414,So she went to 34 places in a matter of days?
13415,"If life is 'normal', then why not, when she had 3 negative tests and 14 days of quarantine, and was scanning her QR code?"
13416,"Again, your perception of how many have died, and how the virus is transmitted, is very wrong indeed."
13417,It's shocking how your media has completely brainwashed your society to believe this.
13418,And the endless posts about how great your economy is completely overlooks the decimated industries.
13419,"And there is more to come, as your recovery will be longer in the coming years."
13420,"Meanwhile your country is directly responsible for the hundreds of thousands dying of starvation in Fiji, and Bali, and other locations in the Pacific."
13421,I certainly hope that you have increased foreign aid substantially to offset that.
13422,Most of the world isn't really fearful and anxious.
13423,"Most people are working around restrictions, or just ignoring them entirely when they don't make sense."
13424,"I'm well grounded in reality, and have continued to travel around much of the globe."
13425,"After spending a lot of time in Australia, these reponses do not surprise me, although they do disgust me that a developed society could disintegrate this way so quickly."
13426,&gt;The conditions for the AZ vaccine were specifically that it should be non-profit and that production should maximise access and protect against vaccine nationalism.
13427,"It is the only vaccine that came with such license and is able to be freely produced elsewhere and is cheaper than sinopharm, sinovac or sputnik."
13428,It's important to remember the uk government had a say in this too.
13429,Lots of people are just saying the university demanded it but that's simply not true.
13430,"Due to funding, the uk government had a direct say in the partnership."

13432,Lol just wait till you go to college.
13433,"Coming from someone who graduated college 3 years ago, College is like 70% virtual learning and this was pre Covid on a 30,000 student campus."
13434,Your computer is your life in college.
13435,"There is no in person homework to turn in or physical quizzes, or someone to remind you every day to do something it’s all online."
13436,Hate to tell you but you doing e-learning in High school prepared you more for college then in person learning would have.
13437,You misunderstood them
13438,Fair enough.
13439,"Thankfully it only dropped very briefly, in after hours trading, then quickly went from 130 to 160 and now 220."
13440,"Our government will loosen restrictions in the spring/summer too, last year they did even without a vaccine."
13441,But we cannot do it to the same degree as other nations that already have all their elders protected.
13442,My experience as an Australian and American here in Melboutne has been wild.
13443,My friends and colleagues generally have known COVID is serious shit but them doing stuff like visiting friends in regional areas or renting Air BnBs because they were tired of being at home.
13444,Basically staying in different suburbs weekly.
13445,My cousin straight up didn't give a shit and would hold parties on weekends and travel to all corners of the Metro area for work.
13446,Another co-worker was going back and forth to Bunnings because she had just moved and wanted to paint her house.
13447,The kicker was the people I manage trying to get me to write them blanket travel exemptions even though we were exclusively WFH.
13448,"Even on the news you'd see people partying at beaches and they'd get labelled backpackers, even though our borders were closed and there was no evidence they were foreign."
13449,"Don't get me wrong, we did well, but in my experience the response was people crowing about doing the right thing and dobbing people in while finding any loophole possible to not do the right thing."
13450,There was way more luck involved in our success than anyone wants to admit.
13451,Important work I wish more redditors read as they interact with new science writing in this sub and others.
13452,"It's not, use bing"
13453,I'm assuming it's the same group of people they've tracked through different stages of vaccination.
13454,Hard to know with such limited data and explanations if that holds.
13455,[removed]
13456,It's Oregon.
13457,"And no, I don't ""want"" to stay ""cooped up forever""."
13458,"But I want even less to become infected with something that has the very real potential to so severely compromise my cognitive abilities that I can't work, or concentrate on reading, or write."
13459,"As far as getting ""mad"" at everyone else - that's not it at all."
13460,And normal is not a possibility until this IS truly under control.
13461,"I'm not sure at all how people are coming to the conclusion that this virus is anywhere near the point of becoming something we can choose to just ""live with""."
13462,I would say that the most relevant statement about getting mad is this: Don't get mad at the authorities when after months of people refusing to take still necessary precautions they have to start shutting things down again.
13463,It has been airborne since the start.
13464,Wow.
13465,That's impressive.
13466,Thanks!
13467,"I guess they misunderstood what the ""me, too"" movement is about."
13468,And get the car warranty spammers to call people for appointments
13469,"&gt; Also the UK is taking a risky strategy by delaying its second doses

Everyone keeps saying this, it's not risky."
13470,"The vast majority of their doses are AZ which has been tested for the longer period, and proven efficacy even increases with the delay."
13471,And that's not even including the public health reasons for maximising first doses.
13472,The AZ CEO says he's positive it's the best option for their vaccine.
13473,And even a single Pfizer vaccine has sufficient efficacy.
13474,"So even if overall efficacy decreased, the impact an any individual would be negligible."
13475,What if we allowed subject matter experts to work as teachers with far less red tape?
13476,I’ve been a software engineer for 30 years.
13477,"I can and do volunteer a little time at a local private school to teach kids things their public school teachers will never know: how to *actually* defend against hackers , how to keep data private, etc."
13478,"I’d consider being a teacher but I’m not going to school for two years to get a certificate, the investment of time is not worth it."
13479,"Some events are still planning full steam ahead, even in heavily restricted areas."
13480,One that comes to mind is Electric Zoo for labor day weekend in NYC.
13481,"And UK contract &gt; EU contract, right?"
13482,First you should take care of your own people then help others.
13483,It's like donating to charity when you don't have enough money for your own family .
13484,Normally vaccines provide a better immune response with a longer gap.
13485,"Tests with the AZ vaccine showed this, which is why it's been recommended by the JCVI, an expert panel of vaccinologists and immunologists."
13486,"If there were any significant long term side effects, especially effects that affect children and teens, they would’ve definitely been discovered by now."
13487,"The long term side effect argument is useless when only a small handful of cases have actually had long term effects, and the vast majority of those cases are with people who are old and have pre-existing conditions."
13488,You obviously aren’t a student or a parent.
13489,You don’t know the struggles parents and students have had to put up with through this entire pandemic.
13490,"Also as far as I’m aware, a children’s vaccine hasn’t even entered clinical trials yet."
13491,"A children’s vaccine may not be available for another year, and then even when it does come out, you have to administer all those doses which takes longer."
13492,We cannot wait any longer.
13493,There is scientific evidence that proves kids are low risk from the virus and schools can open safely when adults and teachers are vaccinated.
13494,Stop.
13495,Moving.
13496,The.
13497,Goalposts.
13498,"There's still buffet-esque things open right now, like pizza places near me still have their self serve salad bars open, and the whole foods has their hot bar and salad bar open, maybe with a couple tweaks."
13499,I wouldn't be surprised at all if buffet style restaurants come back after this is over.
13500,"Posting photos of your card can help provide scammers with information they can use to create and sell phony ones,"" they said."
13501,Why would anyone buy a phony card?
13502,The vaccine is free so I dont understand  it.

13504,Finally a little bit of apparent compassion from the Israelis.
13505,Probably some leftover doses.
13506,Either that or they're giving them spoiled doses lol

13515,AZ vaccine is like a gift to world so sharing it is a duty.
13516,Yes they should.
13517,"In Quebec, canada they can't use n95, restrictions imposed by public health."
13518,"Note that quebec doesn't recognize airborne sras cov 2, only droplets in less then 2 meters."
13519,Hey come-on so I did that bleach thing for nothing
13520,[removed]
13521,The UK is not blocking exports of vaccines.
13522,It just has a contract with AZ to take the first N doses.
13523,Neither side in this particular fight is advocating no measures.
13524,"The big difference is, the EU has their own Oxford AstraZeneca production sites on the continent and shouldn’t be depending on the UK for vaccines."
13525,Whereas the UK was *always* meant to get their Pfizer vaccines from Belgium.
13526,The UK refusing to give away their own vaccines to the EU is **not** the same as the EU preventing supplies intended for the British people from reaching the UK.
13527,"They get off on d00ming out, what can I say."
13528,Cause protesting itself in person spreads covid.

13535,One of the few things Hancock has got right.
13536,"To be fair, the Australian open is happening in a city 2500km away from the one that had the positive case today."
13537,For beginners...
13538,The best effort clause is limited to them producing the initial doses to EU in the EU.
13539,"We have 17 locations from this one case already, including a convention centre and five supermarkets."
13540,He's been busy.
13541,Further at this point we don't know of how he acquired it through ppe.
13542,A lot will be learnt by which variant he's got - it's not impossible that it comes back that he didn't even catch it from his work at this stage.
13543,"We'll know a lot more in a day or two, hence the breather."
13544,Hehe we must live in different countries called Australia if that is your take on it.
13545,The one thing heavily in an individuals control - social distancing - just wasn't happening much.
13546,"Luckily, the federal and state governments (primarily states) implemented strong measures to prevent the spread of the virus."
13547,"And luckily perhaps, the general apathy towards defying authority in Australia allowed those measures to be implemented."
13548,Not 'all' the population.
13549,This is what they are talking about when the subject of 'herd immunity' is discussed.
13550,"Let's look at it from the point of view of the virus, call him or her 'Mr or Ms V'."
13551,"It begins when V find a new happy home, but there's a problem."
13552,V has only a limited time in the abode.
13553,At the end of that time either the landlord has kicked him or her out or the comfy home falls to pieces ie the patient dies.
13554,"Now, when a landlord kicks V out they change the locks."
13555,V can't get in anymore (unless they change their appearance as this article suggests).
13556,During the rental period V has to come upon some other unguarded house to move into.
13557,"Otherwise he or she will wither and die out in the cold, cruel world."
13558,"When V hits town there are endless houses, all with no locks, and life is good."
13559,"As the landlords become aware of V, however, it takes the poor virus longer and longer to find an unlocked door."
13560,"V's chances plummet, and eventually the poor thing is almost certain to die homeless."
13561,The development of a vaccine fits into this metaphor in the sense that someone has taken upon themselves to provide the landlords with locks just in case V drops by.
13562,This is how the usual epidemic or pandemic develops.
13563,The likelihood is that the locks/vaccines will not be totally ineffective.
13564,In fact that is close to being utterly impossible.
13565,What this means is that the percentage of people infected and the length of the pandemic will be reduced by a certain factor that depends on how effective the vaccine is.
13566,"Now, as to 'telling or not telling'."
13567,This virus has become the most studied virus to ever exist.
13568,"There is a huge amount of information, and much of the information is still in dispute."
13569,"The upper levels of all governments are completely and *totally* dependent on the advise of a much greater number of experts in various fields, AND what these experts know is almost entirely open to the public."
13570,It's public knowledge.
13571,It can't be hidden.
13572,"The capacity of the rulers of a given country to comprehend such matters varies, of course, from fairly intelligent, humble and willing to follow good advise to mentally incapable and uncaring except for their own interests."
13573,"An example of a politician with high mental capacity would be Angela Merkel of Germany, She was a research scientist in quantum chemistry until 1989."
13574,The crowd is much thicker at the lower end of the ladder.
13575,"The trick to all this is that there are few, perhaps none, politicians in the world today capable of forming anything beyond an educated  layperson's view of the problem."
13576,"There are many, without naming names, who are incapable of grasping even that view of the subject."
13577,'Intellectual' or 'orange-assed baboon' and all points in between all have the same limitation; they can't 'hide' things that are common knowledge amongst the experts.
13578,"They may make statements meant to frighten or to create a false optimism (""it will be over by Easter""), but that's all they can do."
13579,The facts are out there.
13580,"All that's left is to play on emotions - which is not really ""hiding"" anything."
13581,This case is guaranteed to address that issue
13582,No the government have delivered what is expected of a modern developed nation.
13583,The rotting mess on the continent have made the ordinary look extraordinary.
13584,Shout out to Daniel Andrews for the amazing response to the covid pandemic.
13585,Or working lungs.
13586,He just sends SWAT teams to arrest you if you publish data he doesn't like.
13587,"There were random police checkpoints, they would check your home address on your license."
13588,"Only excuse for traveling more than 5km from home is for essential work or receiving healthcare, all essential workplaces were issued with government documents they distributed to their workers to allow travel."
13589,"This was primarily in metro areas, more rural areas of course you could live more than 5km from the nearest supermarket and you might need to do groceries."
13590,Rural areas weren't impacted much by covid and they had looser restrictions.
13591,Daily death rates is the best way to confirm the lower number of positive tests.
13592,"Unfortunately the data is 10x noisier due to to small numbers, and also lags another couple of weeks behind the test trend."
13593,Wait another few weeks to get a better picture from that metric.
13594,"Looking at places that peaked a couple months ago, like Wisconsin and the Dakotas, there has also been substantial decrease in deaths."
13595,"Fuck yeah, way to go cobber!"
13596,Bring on the Trans-Tasman covid-free travel bubble!
13597,Sending thoughts and pav from a cuzzy in NZ.
13598,"Ah, thanks for clarifying."
13599,"It'll all come back to what transmission we pick up in those 5 days, gives a good idea of the general infectiousness."
13600,That's what was really telling from my perspective in regards to our overall willingness to take collective responsibility.
13601,Where I live as soon as the mask mandate came into effect literally overnight in places like shopping centres it went from the minority of people wearing them to barely anyone not doing so.
13602,And it's not as though they are actually inconvient or restrictive either.
13603,I have asthma and they didn't bother me in the least.

13640,The same is true of Australia.
13641,The US is less urban than either of those countries.
13642,But of course the US couldn't manage it on a federal level.
13643,But it was the individual states which were in charge of managing the pandemic and they aren't that big.
13644,NZ would rank 25th in population if it were a state.
13645,Only a few US states were already overwhelmed at the start of the pandemic.
13646,"Over 40 states had the chance to require anyone entering the state to quarantine for two weeks, using their phone or an electronic monitor to make sure they stayed put."
13647,"They could have done a 4 week NZ/Aus style lockdown (not the half-assed ""lockdowns"" most US states did) and brought numbers down to elimination level easily in most states."

so im from jordan , thankfully vaccination started with the elderly having priority , propably will need 4 or 5 months minimum to get vaccinated (my own prediction)

but i dont have a choice in picking which vaccine to take due to shortage of vaccines until now, if i dont get pfizer , should i take the chinese one (sinopharm) ?!"

13746,Looks like you don’t understand ventilation.
13747,You don’t need to open windows or doors to ventilate a building or room.
13748,Air Exchanges are done via VENTILATION SYSTEMS.
13749,"You can’t distance all the kids, that’s why you have groupings, that’s why you have masks, and why you have ventilation."
13750,"Kids transmit less as per the CDC, and seeing as you had no idea how ventilation works I somehow doubt you know more than the CDC."
13751,It’s not gaslighting to go with the facts.
13752,"My kids are at home, our schools don’t require masks and our community spread is off the chart so the reduction in transmission isn’t nearly enough to make it safe, but I am looking into a prestigious private school in the region that requires masks, has HEPA filters installed, and ventilates as much as a hospital."
13753,"That’s still one less kid in the local public school, so it’s win-win."

13812,A requirement to use “best reasonable efforts” is lawyer speak for “we’ll try our best but can’t promise anything”.
13813,The reality is the EU dropped the ball on this one.
13814,Consistently late to place orders and consistently underspending per-capita in comparison to the UK.
13815,"Because at the time, there wasn’t any need for a regional identifier in order to differentiate it from any other emerging novel viruses threatening global pandemic."
13816,The obsession over calling it “wuhan virus” was driven by ethnonationalism.
13817,The current naming of variants by where they emerge comes from a place of legitimate etymological need.
13818,British factories will be used to supply the EU's orders as soon as the contractual obligations of Britain's initial order have been carried out.
13819,"Honestly, considering this is a British vaccine distributed by a Anglo-Swedish firm at cost, and we are being called ""selfish"" and ""whores"" for it, it would have been much better just to distribute it to more grateful recipients, and not the organisation that has spent the last four years laughing at us and reminding us how alone we are after we left their little club."
13820,"This sub is full of people who can assess the risk that social distancing is too much when the at risk and vulnerable are vaccinated

I’m a public health major, have had two friends die from this virus, worked at both covid disinfecting and a covid test lab... it’s safe to say I respect the virus."
13821,But states will lift restrictions when deaths are gone.
13822,Sometimes the mechanism that causes a higher infection rate also causes a higher mortality rate.
13823,"Increased viral load in the infected, for example"
13824,Are you suggesting they shouldn't report field hospitals being setup?

13847,Shots going into the arms of people that hopped on a flight to get them is a bad idea.
13848,"Not only will it drive up cases and further disperse any variants of  concern, it will place selective pressure on the virus to mutate to be vaccine resistant."
13849,And two doses means double the risk.
13850,"That's two flights with little no to immunity and two flights with partial immunity, which would put most people in that situation at more risk than if they had just waited to get the shots."
13851,And it would put everybody else at exponentially more risk.
13852,"Driving is safer, but will likely require someone to stay in hotel/motel/airbnb or with friends/family."
13853,"Unless you live near the border, which is somewhat more understandable, provided they have enough vaccines to spare."
13854,"&gt;Just going out on a limb here but I’m gonna say the people traveling to get the vaccine believe in science


This is part of the problem."
13855,"One can ""believe in science"" and still be uninformed."
13856,Those people need to take an evolutionary biology course or actually *listen* to what the experts have to say: we need to limit the spread until the vaccines can be administered or we may render them less effective or possibly even altogether ineffective.
13857,This virus is mutating faster than we predicted because we have rampant spread.
13858,A lot of people who have recovered are getting reinfected because the genetic diversity of the virus has continued to increase exponentially.
13859,Just because someone trusts that the vaccines work does not entitle them to walk over someone else's corpse to get it.
13860,"Yes, they work amazingly well, in fact."
13861,"As long as we, as a society, don't fuck them up by  breeding and then circulating a variant that is specifically resistant to them."
13862,"And I'm not even getting into the ethical considerations yet, this is just why it is a bad idea from a scientific perspective."
13863,"It's also a bad idea because it puts those without the financial means to hop on a flight at the back of the line while fostering an attitude that ""everyone for themselves"" is an acceptable policy for the government to take during a pandemic."
13864,"Reminds me of the ""fema-camps"" conspiracy theory, although I think that was supposed to be for detention of anti vaxxers, not vaccinations."

13915,The sudden jump can be attributed to faster vaccinations but possibly also over-reporting on that day (vaccines from the 19th and 18th being reported on the 20th).
13916,https://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/covid-vaccine-tracker-global-distribution/

13921,Depends on your definition of “over”.

13923,When we don’t wear masks?
13924,When deaths hit 0 per day?
13925,Anyone have an ETA until we reach 80% vaccinated in US?
13926,Looking forward to no longer having to wear masks :D
13927,That’s really interesting.
13928,I’m suprised this isn’t spoken about more.
13929,I'm quite sure the plan is to vaccinate every adult who wants it.
13930,"However, as an Australian stuck overseas who cannot get home, I have to question the long term plan for bringing citizens back."
13931,They've had ten months to work this out and all they've done is *jack shit*.
13932,"Because when planes sit and essentially rot, and you start laying off experienced technicians, x-ray specialists, etc, getting those exact people back won't happen, and the retraining process is no joke."

13947,Early on people underestimated how much the death rate varies by age for this virus.

13968,"I think what will get their attention is that eventually we won't give them paid leave if they are sick, once they drain their leave and aren't getting paid they'll wish to get it."
13969,Which leaves us in a position of what do we do if we have 1 person who wants it and that's it?
13970,We aren't tapping a vial for a single admin.

13974,"nice, here in a smaller eu country we have caccinated half of that, but since December 2020... so we have about 2% of population vaccinated and the mass roll out  of vaccines where vaccine import is not the main bottleneck is not expected until late spring early summer (hopefully 2021)."

Not replying further."
13980,Have a good one fr this time.
13981,Sorry but the really small number of people who would die in a snowstorm getting vaccinated compared to the number of people they could potentially infect and in fact caused their own death... it's absolutely the right decision to keep vaccinating no matter what in all circumstances until out of vaccine.
13982,it's about risk tradeoffs and this would be the right one
13983,Love how they are protesting lockdowns at the thing that will help end lockdowns.
13984,Morons.
13985,No one is hoarding.
13986,Every vaccine being produced is being used.
13987,Pfizer and Moderna are supposed to deliver 200m doses by the end of March.
13988,I think it's possible.
13989,&gt; a dose response (ie the more virus you are exposed to the sicker you get).
13990,Not so sure about that.
13991,Do you have a source for this?
13992,"Perhaps it **might** (operative word here) help reduce, but not eliminate, the risk of getting a severe or lethal case, but viral dose isn't the only factor."
13993,"I bet there are also other factors (general health, weight, immune system, risk factors, etc.)"
13994,that will determine your prognosis.
13995,"I suspect viral dose *may* play a part in having a less severe case *for some people,* but it's not the only factor, and how much that *factor is weighted* with respect to other factors varies from person to person and can't easily be quantified."
13996,More people there are getting treatment like ivermectin and the population average age is like 25 or thereabouts.
13997,That literally makes no sense.
13998,The Sinopharm vaccine I suspect is mostly bullshit in that it's the most difficult to produce out of the existing ones.
13999,You have to grow a live contagious virus in expensive mammilian cells in a high level biohazard containment facility.
14000,I doubt they can grow billions of doses to vaccinate their internal population let alone fulfil exports.
14001,Meanwhile Canada is now restricting it with a forced user paid quarantine and cancelled flights to sunny destinations and everyone in /r/canada is saying to little to late not worth bothering anymore.

14007,"If we go by a million a day for the next 30 days, that'll bring the total # of people vaccinated to around 60 million."
14008,"That's still, again, not a lot."

14010,You'll need it for what youre studying for

14013,Gap.
14014,"It's Watford Gap, not Watford."
14015,Or you think a small part of the M25 is in the North.
14016,Switzerland (where I live) had very soft lockdowns and the numbers exploded.
14017,It really seems to depend on a lot of factors.
14018,[removed]
14019,I was not aware of any lockdown in Finland?
14020,When did this happened?

14022,I don’t wanna downplay the disease but you’ll most like be fine my dude.
14023,In your age range the chances you survive this are probably still above 99%.
14024,Keep us updated on the symptoms though if you like!

14030,"I mean it is estimated that at least 150,000 people enter the U.K illegally each year."
14031,"Technically it is possible to search every single vehicle, patrol the North sea, Atlantic, and English channel with a fleet of boats etc."
14032,But that is a huge undertaking and requires a lot more resources and disruptions to supply than Australia has ever faced.
14033,"&gt; If the UK had had a decent response instead of not taking it seriously, it would now put the rest of Europe to shame."
14034,I agree with you.
14035,The U.K does have a superior position in relation to many European neighbours.
14036,I would stop well short of suggesting the U.K is as isolated and as easily secured geographically as Australia is though.
14037,Also I am not saying Australia's actions would not achieve similar results in other countries - assuming all countries implemented the same.
14038,I am suggesting that implementing those measures is much easier for a variety of reasons in Australia versus other countries.
14039,Being a remote island is big one factor.

14062,I have to lay down now.
14063,"By the way, I live in New Jersey, and I can't imagine anyone here doing this and getting away with it."
14064,"Maybe because we were literally the worst state for cases early on per capita (yes, worse than New York per 100k, we are *still* the worst per 100k despite lower overall numbers the rest of 2020 'til now), but our Governor instituted mandatory masks so early on that everyone just did it."
14065,"In May and even June, I remember going down the list because my wife thought all states had mandatory mask requirements in public, but that wasn't true."
14066,Only like one or two other states did.
14067,She said what about New York?
14068,Nope.
14069,"Even in NYC, it was only ""guidance""."
14070,"So in NJ, even people that I'd never think would follow the rules just wore the damn mask and was blind-sided by news coming in over the summer elsewhere."
14071,"I think it's cause people here are so aggressive even when they're doing something they disagree with, that they expect everyone else to do the same."
14072,"Nobody will pass up an opportunity to say, ""Hey, I gotta wear it, so you gotta wear it,"" when you're at Target or wherever."
14073,Parents telling other parents to tell their kids to put the masks on.
14074,"I've seen people get up and leave, but never fight back about ""muh freedumbs!"""
14075,The ONE time early on that I forgot to social distance was in a line for mother's day cards.
14076,"I walked up to the cards and didn't realize there was a line just to look at cards and stay distanced and a guy yelled at me and goes, ""Hey man, social distancing, we're all social distancing, get in the line!"""
14077,"I just said I didn't realize and I was sorry, cause it was right next to a line to a register."
14078,"The guy said he was sorry, but appreciated that I understood."
14079,No fuss.
14080,No muss.
14081,"But if I protested, everyone else in that line would have joined in a chorus of telling me to STFU, get in line, or get out of the store."
14082,So you kind of risk being yelled at in public even by people who wouldn't wear one if they lived in some other state.
14083,It's times like that that I've appreciated living in a state filled with so many loud mouthed assholes.
14084,It most likely will be accurate as far as I know
14085,I saw a comment from someone in one of the threads here that said they hadn't let their 4 year old play with other kids at anytime during the last 10 months.
14086,Is this normal in the US?
14087,"It seems very extreme and detrimental to children's developmental health and happiness, especially when considering the very low risk for children."
14088,"No, it did not."
14089,For johnson and johnson they’re still testing.
14090,The Biontech and moderna vaccines are as good as they come.
14091,They offer near perfect protection.
14092,It likely won’t get any better than that.
14093,Plus I’ve read that the second shot most of the time comes with more “severe” side effects.
14094,I can only imagine that a third shot would amplify that problem.

14113,I've read about 1 in 6 skipping the vaccine is enough to keep this nightmare going indefinitely (calculated based on spread rate).
14114,France is also in a social and economic mess because the government always indulges the population's unrealistic demands.
14115,True.
14116,Austria had 2 weeks in November.
14117,Another 2 weeks added whenever the lockdown is about to end within a week.
14118,Exception was december 8th to 25th (for christmas shopping and christmas).
14119,"7th of feb is the next aim and numbers really have gone down (8k down to 1.5k a day, but the decline kinda stopped around 2k."

14124,You can try to spin it however you want.
14125,"We’ve had over 435,000 Covid-19 deaths in the US in less than a year - which equates to a 1.7% OFR by the way, not “less than 1%”."
14126,Something that didn’t even exist a year ago was the *third* leading cause of death in 2020.
14127,FFS talk about scare-mongering headlines...
14128,"VIRUSES DONT LEARN

With the crazy high rates of cases in the USA, SA and Brazil the virus has more chance to mutate."
14129,"Some of those mutations are more transmissible, some may have increased vaccine resistance."
14130,"The solution is to slow the viruses transmission

1) Masks

2) Lockdowns

3) Distancing

4) Vaccinations

Once the rates are low enough you can do contact tracing and quarantine for positive cases to contain local outbreaks while the vaccinations have time to rollout and take effect."
14131,Truck drivers in Australia moving freight across state borders during the lockdowns were tested once every 7 days.
14132,"As far as I am aware they are still frequently being tested, just not every week now."
14133,If you just keep them away from the internet this might resolve itself.

14182,Indeed... Noone needs to go through what we did here in Melbourne.

14184,1) quarantine workers are the most important workers in the state.
14185,Vet them properly and pay them well.
14186,"2) if things go bad go hard and early, don't wish for things to improve."

14196,What's WA?
14197,"Nah, just smarter than people who gatekeep comparisons."
14198,"Sydney airport has 44,000,000 passengers compared to Blackpool's 15,000."
14199,"It has about the same number as the UK's number two airport, Gatwick"
14200,"Good observation, American, but not quite there."
14201,His career isn't just a bad blame game.
14202,"For most of his adult life, he was a public servant."
14203,He career really took off after getting fired from high-paying public sector jobs (he was the former head of Tourism Australia and Tourism NZ) due to corruption issues.
14204,"As he is a master of cultivating  relationships in high areas, he falls 'up', not down."
14205,"Australia's news media are mostly pro LNP (the current Coalition government), and many of them, particularly News Corp (which also owns Fox News in the US) will defend Morrison to the death."
14206,"Media fawn over him, as he releases streams of announcements which they will gladly lap up for."
14207,He is well-known for orchestrating Australian Federal Police raids on trade unions and media outlets which badmouth him.
14208,News Corp is extremely aggressive at pushing climate change denial and will tear apart any politician who thinks of taking action against climate change.
14209,"In fact, he does not truly owe his power to the Australian people - he attained power from News Corp as it led a smear campaign against his first political opponent in the LNP, and has constantly done everything to keep him in power."
14210,"**So far, his career is corruption, creeping authoritarianism, and dedicating the nation's resources to protecting fossil fuels."
14211,He is also supported by a media protection racket.
14212,"**

**In the 90s and 2000s, the LNP Coalition government introduced superannuation tax concessions, negative gearing and franking credits (dividend imputations), whilst eroding media concentration laws."
14213,"The mechanics of these laws are complicated, but put simply, these ensured the older segments of the population got much richer at the expense of younger generations."
14214,This effectively created a loyal voter base (it is really just vote buying).
14215,"Due to the large size of older populations, younger and more progressive voters were destroyed at the polls by gigantic tsunamis of older generation votes (particularly Boomers)."
14216,"**

A picture emerges."
14217,He pisses off the nations treasury to buy votes from the older generations.
14218,He probably wants to establish a fossil fuel dictatorship.
14219,Now Covid arrives.
14220,The way he handled the pandemic was an absolute sham.
14221,"If he had his way, we would be going the way of the UK."
14222,"Thankfully, the state premiers (equivalent to a US governor), imposed harsh restrictions and gave regular press conferences, thus bypassing him."
14223,Morrison was more interested in a Hillsong conference (his favorite prosperity gospel-preaching church) than stopping a pandemic.
14224,T Morrison was basically dragged kicking and screaming into action.
14225,The real heroes are the state premiers.
14226,**Our secret sauce on how we handled the pandemic well lies in the states who mostly ran the show.
14227,"** 

You may remember how Melbourne had a particularly nasty outbreak which leaked from hotel quarantine."
14228,Victoria's premier copped a lot of flack for weak quarantine practices and he also happens to be a master of deflecting blame and there's the 'everyone's guilty but at the same time everyone's not guilty' atmosphere.
14229,"Morrison attacked the VIC premier, but he stood his ground."
14230,"Once the outbreak in VIC was fully brought under control, Morrison took credit for Dan Andrew's (VIC premier) actions (like everyone other state)."
14231,**So a disturbing picture emerges.
14232,His modus operandi is fairly simple.
14233,"Hide from any tough situation, blame anyone who slips up, and take all the credit for it once the situation is resolved."
14234,Thank god the Constitution gives state governments a large amount of autonomy.
14235,"**

*Ladies and gentlemen, that is Scotty from Marketing for you."

Scotty from Marketing is a derogatory nickname for Morrison, as he is an all talk and no action person."

14262,2) Did Johnson &amp; Johnson test if a 2nd dose of their vaccine yield any significant improvement?
14263,"From the little I've heard on the news, I understand Pfizer &amp; Moderna are different vaccines (mRNA)...and more is not always better, but am curious if a 2nd shot of Johnson &amp; Johnson was included in their trials, and if so, what were the results."

14290,"&gt;Spanish flu killed 65,000 in October."
14291,Multiply by 3.2 to adjust for the difference in population.
14292,"In other words, if the US population in 1918 were the same as in 2020, and the percentage that died from the Spanish flu in 1918-19 were the same as in the actual event, then 208,000 people would have died from the Spanish flu in October 1918."
14293,"France/Germany/Italy set up the orders at the same time as the UK/US, then the EU commission comes in and dithers around, wasting 3 months of time before they finally sign it."
14294,3 months that could've been spent setting up factories.

14313,"You mean, like my 9 month old?"
14314,People not taking the vaccine isn't limited to idiots who refuse it.
14315,There are people on this planet that are unable to take it
14316,There absolutely is data for the AZ vaccine with the longer delay.
14317,It's even more effective with the longer delay.

14327,Q3 / Q4 is their prediction for herd immunity.
14328,"But, we will be mostly back to normal prior to herd immunity since the most vulnerable people are getting vaccinated first, so the death rate / hospitalization rate will be way down in Q2."
14329,Wow who would want to go to an indoor concert if they’re forced to wear masks.

14334,"If I show you my grades from the last four years, and you see the same exact amount of students failed all four years, what would you say then?"
14335,"What if I told you the problem is accessibility, not online learning."
14336,You’ve already mentioned you are not a teacher.
14337,Just give it a rest already.
14338,Your agenda is showing.
14339,My grandmother used to cook with teargas but after the fifth hospital visit for my grandfather Thanksgiving morning we told her to stop.
14340,"Tear gas is a good seasoning, but you need to use it in a well-ventilated area."
14341,Senior citizens' ventilation isn't as strong as a healthy twenty-five year old ventilation system.
14342,"It's because they've used their inner ventilation for too many years, and the only way to replace yours is to fight another senior citizen to the death."
14343,But to know if someones sense of smell has recovered from covid19.
14344,You'd have to calibrate how sensitive it was before they caught covid19.
14345,Oh no.
14346,No no no.
14347,2021 leave Captain Tom alone!
14348,"If J+J gets the OK mid/late Feb as expected and rates smooth out then absolutely, at least in terms of 1st jabs."
14349,I drove 3 hours (180 miles)south from Atlanta and then 3 hours back for the vaccine a few days back.
14350,I was almost in Florida.
14351,Worth it.
14352,The spreadnecks here are out in full force.
14353,The government threw some money at Deloitte who came back with something that's junk.
14354,Definitely.
14355,Daily vaccinations is going at a decent pace and providing supply isn't an issue the vast majority of the population could be vaccinated by summer.
14356,The elderly/vulnerable should all be vaccinated by spring the latest at which point we should see a significant drop in hispitlisations etc
14357,"I believe it’s just Captain, you don’t need the Sir."
14358,Great news !
14359,"It could also be the opportunity for more
Mutations."
14360,I went to school with plenty of kids who didn't have food or internet access at home and who needed school as a safe place to go.
14361,Plenty of them are very successful adults now because we had access to a great public school that offered free breakfast and lunch and let kids stay at the school every night until 7 pm if they wanted (with computer access to do homework or just relax).
14362,I'm fine with writing off bad students but don't write off student simply for lacking access.
14363,I know it’s what the Bush administration lawyers came up with.
14364,I just believe it’s morally bankrupt.
14365,Novavax and JJ vaccines will likely double the vaccine availability in the coming months.

14371,"We felt good and rejoiced but now we look like idiots, this is equal to “having the most fire trucks show up 2 days after your house burns down"
14372,"None of the vaccines are 100% effective against COVID, so for example the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines are both around 95% effective based on the data from the clinical trials... That's still 5% of people that will carry the virus."
14373,Of course all countries should require PCR tests before travel to be able to leverage all the tools from the toolbox to reduce spread.
14374,not the WHO; they are one of the reasons china did not declare the pandemic
14375,"The same article will have a headline and opening making it sound like the end of the world, only in the content to have a quote from a medical expert saying all the vaccines are effective against the variants with the data to back them up."

14387,"So like the 2017 tax law the raises our tax burden this year, and passed by budget reconciliation."
14388,You're being downvoted but it's a completely fair comment.
14389,Why on earth are we all being vaccinated and then being asked to do the tests as well.
14390,I'd be ok with it but the tests are £150 a person in the UK because you cant use the NHS.
14391,You mean Spanish flu?
14392,"The situation is not really comparable, for a bunch of reasons."
14393,* They did not develop a vaccine for Spanish flu during the pandemic.
14394,"We currently have many effective vaccines for covid, with more on the way."
14395,"* Spanish flu had a much higher infection fatality ratio than covid, and unlike covid it heavily impacted young, healthy people."
14396,"* Even though the Spanish flu pandemic officially lasted for two years, restrictions were no where near as widespread and lasted for a much shorter time period than the current restrictions."
14397,"When people ask ""when will the pandemic end?"""
14398,"they mostly mean ""when will life be back to normal"" rather than ""when will the WHO declare the official end of the pandemic""."
14399,"In the case of the Spanish flu, for most people life was only abnormal for a few months, and it was not nearly as abnormal as life has been during covid."

14406,My local GP is doing a trickle of these.
14407,Some small % of first dose appointments are no shows and the GP wants to use up the doses.
14408,So people get a phone call at 4pm “if you can get here in 20 minutes you can have a second dose”.
14409,Happened to my grandfather at least.
14410,I think they’re meant to discard unused doses but seems preferable to me to use them up in any willing patient.

14416,"Is  was developed by Biontech, a germany company."
14417,"Is it just me, because I'm german, that I think of this vaccine as Biontech vaccine?"
14418,"Ontario did a whopping 2,000 yesterday!"

14426,A crime?
14427,Don't spread misinformation.
14428,"The J&amp;J shot is highly effective, and will most likely receive FDA approval."
14429,just less so than Moderna or Pfizer.
14430,GOP wants to hand out less money cause they already spent 7 trillion on something?
14431,&gt; but it's better than nothing.
14432,Who knows but the point is that they're not designed for the wearer to not catch the virus.
14433,Like the comment I replied to claimed.
14434,It's for the wearer to not spread it around.
14435,So let's revisit this question around early May.
14436,"They are probably doing that too

But this is just adding more baskets to put your eggs in."
14437,Complaining is a disease.

14440,"1 year ago we were completely desperate about this disease, the news were like ""vaccines could take years to come""."

14449,Sanofi will be producing for the EU
14450,Germany is ramping up the production of BioNTech.
14451,"They funded BNT around 350 million euro to buy Novartis in September, which is going online in February."
14452,"According yo BNT, the vaccines should take three to four weeks of quality checks before hitting the market."
14453,"If everything goes as planned, mid to late march would be a reasonable expectation with a production capacity of 250 million doses per quarter."

14470,"Bruh, we ordered so many but got fucked over by the vaccine companies in the end..."
14471,Because we could have been able to stop the virus.
14472,Meat processors were hit terribly in the beginning of this.
14473,A production hold while we ate off frozen stocks would have been able to get out in front of this.
14474,"Going back to the begining of this do you remember spot shortages, panic buying and hoarding?"
14475,An enforced production hold would require rationing otherwise we'd have shortages.
14476,Now we have a runaway new coronavirus.
14477,2 months of solid governement response and control efforts could perhaps have prevented 2 years of printing money to dump into the economy as well as a lot of misery.
14478,The opposite I’ll be true though too.
14479,"There are going to be people who take the vaccine, still get covid and still die, just not at the rates we’re seeing it now."
14480,Or it could just mean it's still in the news and outbreaks are still happening steadily until 70%.
14481,I think it's just a vague prediction more than a policy threshold.
14482,"I like to think that its us around Nottinghamshire, Derbyshire and Leicestershire who are the ones who speak correctly."

14491,Most of my students parents are so busy they don’t have time to grocery shop.
14492,That’s when they can afford it.
14493,How many mothers have you cried with about how hard it is to make a living because they went through the same system 20 years ago?
14494,You want teachers and schools to fix this frogged up society and there’s nothing we can do until we fix the people who try to pin all of the problems on us.
14495,People don't vote for republicans based on this.
14496,"Basically it's up to courts to define what's best effort, and I doubt it would look well that AZ has contracts that overlap and I don't see that s being accept as a best effort."
14497,"At best they are choosing what contract they want to breach, and hide behind best effort clause."
14498,"I really hope EU makes itself weight on AZ, specially after the actions of the CEO that suddenly changed after the contract was released to the public."
14499,"The AZ vaccine has been tested with wider spacing though, and actually proven more effective with the longer delay."
14500,I don't know why people still listen to Osterholm.
14501,All he ever does is fear monger and exaggerate threats.
14502,"I know didn’t get richer this year plus my wife and I almost died, and we lost our businesses if only we were Australian, or Canadian.."
14503,What many people ignore is that lockdowns in most Western countries were not accompanied by a border shutdown + intercity/interstate travel shutdown + they started to lockdown once the virus was already rampant.
14504,NZ and Australia succeeded because they locked down before the virus was rampant AND they closed all external and internal borders.
14505,"While I do agree that if the USA had done the same it would be on the same level of success as NZ and Australia, the reality is that implementation of such measures in the USA was simply impossible due to laws, civilian complacency and geography so the comparisons are moot."
14506,The mutations media fear porn is predictably growing stronger and stronger :/

14578,Good luck being on lockdown for the next few years then lmao
14579,Dope comment bro.
14580,That’s unfortunately not how herd immunity works.

14588,I think we have a very good shot at it.
14589,I think by the end of the summer most people will be vaccinated.

14613,"All the branches of the military have active duty members who are medics, emts, nurses, doctors, etc."
14614,Here's a little homework.

14628,"This vaccine is so safe, im now gojng to give it to my wife and kid."

14630,Stop repeating nonsense
14631,"It's not just ethics, it's also PR."
14632,You start lifting restrictions for vaccinated people only and hope that the rest of the country comes to its senses.
14633,"(Depending on whether the vaccines provide sterilising immunity, we may need to do that anyways."
14634,It would be arguably unconstitutional to continue restricting people who pose no risk to others.)

14684,"If it’s true 80% of Sweden’s population lives in the southern third, the density is still just about 53/km2."
14685,Less than half of Denmark’s and even further below most European countries.
14686,Sweden’s state epidemiologist has repeatedly claimed Sweden to be more comparable to Netherlands and Belgium than to its neighbours.
14687,A [map of population density in Europe ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demographics_of_Europe#/media/File:Population_density_by_NUTS_3_region_(2017).svg) clearly shows this to be an absurd claim.
14688,But Swedes seem to believe it by now.
14689,That someone here is from Sweden does not necessarily mean they know their stuff or are truthful.
14690,Most of the swedes here are just fiercely defending their strategy and their image.
14691,It's ok as long as they don't start asking for restrictions to protect them
14692,"&gt; I think it's just a vague prediction more than a policy threshold

Exactly, this is not formal policy, more of a rule of thumb."
14693,"&gt;From their analysis, the scientists, including those from Boston University in the US, discovered close to 18 existing drugs approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) that could potentially be repurposed to combat Covid-19 soon after a person becomes infected."
14694,That sounds promising.
14695,"I wonder what ""close to 18"" means?"
14696,Is that what's colloquially known as 17?
14697,"Since every vaccine - as far as publicly disclosed - is using the same spike sequence (or spike on inactivated virus) as the antigenic peptide, I'd expect roughly the same efficacy across all of them with regards to mutants."
14698,The second dose acting as a booster should also increase the efficacy towards other mutants - as it increases the level of your circulating antibodies.
14699,"Since not all antibodies (but most) are being generated towards the receptor binding domain (or RBD you'll see mentioned) - the higher your circulating titer of antibodies, the more chance you have of having antibodies that bind out side of the RBD, where most of these mutations of concern are arising in, giving you more efficacy and protection from becoming infected, getting ill, or spreading."
14700,"The other thing we have going for us is that our immune system isn't a slacker, it doesn't just sit here and go ""okay well I saw THIS particular spike protein - so I'll only make antibodies that bind exactly to this spike protein perfectly"" - your memory B cells actually mutate and respond to secondary challenges (infections) - meaning that your immune system is essentially trying to ""cover it's bases"" with a virus it's seen before that may mutate slightly from the antigen it recognized (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3839062/)."

14716,In some sense it is their choice.
14717,People choose what behavior they engage in.
14718,Indefinite lockdowns on a virus like this simply won't work in the US.
14719,Vaccination is the only path out.
14720,Do you mean /r/dankmemes?
14721,Thats not what I'm talking about.
14722,Most districts already have programs to speed through those type of people on provisional teaching certificates.
14723,Still not enough ppl.
14724,"“Sticking points between the two sides include vaccinations of staff, testing, work-from-home accommodations and health metrics for when schools should reopen or shut down during the pandemic, union leaders said earlier this week."
14725,"The union wants all staff to be vaccinated before being required to return to work, weekly testing for staff and testing for students in neighborhoods with the highest infection rates."
14726,CTU also wants people to be able to work from home if they are high risk for severe coronavirus complications or who live with someone who is.
14727,"CPS has agreed to some increased testing of staff and students and work-from-home status for high-risk employees, according to the union."
14728,But the district’s plan would allow about 20 percent of workers who live with a high-risk relative to work remotely.
14729,The district also has agreed to prioritize vaccinations for staff in hardest-hit communities but the union said no details have been offered.
14730,"The two sides also remain at odds about improving remote learning, forgoing simultaneous instruction and not disciplining Pre-K and special education teachers who defied district demands to work in person.”

CTU seems to have pretty reasonable demands honestly."
14731,Except that last thing — no idea what’s up with that.
14732,"We’ve treated teachers like garbage for so long, have we finally found the breaking point?"
14733,I can’t imagine anyone wanting to get into this field after seeing how readily parents and politicians will toss your life away on top of the shit pay.
14734,There is no lockdown NOW in the US.
14735,After most people are vaccinated there won't be any reason for it.
14736,My hope is if we really do hit our targets in the US over the next few months we can start sending vaccine to Canada.
14737,"I know we’ve fucked things up here too, but hearing you guys only vaccinated 15k people nationwide makes me incredibly sad."
14738,"After the JJ news, I think by June we can have our entire country vaccinated and at that point we’ve probably got enough being produced monthly to do all Canada has left in a few weeks."
14739,My favorite part was when this first began and we were having to clean grocery items because we were worried about surfaces

14743,"I go like fuck you, I ain’t wearing a mask unless I’m at a high risk area."
14744,Those people aren’t satisfied with anything.
14745,"Don’t give them an inch, because they will take a mile."
14746,"&gt;Governments will probably be cautious

We can't afford to have an excess of caution."
14747,We need normalcy asap.
14748,Because UK isn't part of the EU.
14749,We're talking about the EU.
14750,You also have to remember where you are.
14751,Reddit and the Internet in general tend to overhype media stories about variants.
14752,I don’t know if restrictions will be totally lifted the summer but I can guarantee you by the end of the year things will be largely back to normal.
14753,And if they aren’t then people make them so.
14754,They are serious but the vaccines are also mostly effective against them
14755,"If you contribute to the spread of a deadly disease when you could have prevented it, you are mentally ill or a psychopath."

14762,Ok.
14763,I believe you.
14764,I agree with what are you saying.
14765,That's kind of the point I was making.
14766,The comment I replied to said that getting vaccines in arms is worth the risk of letting people travel out of state.
14767,"For the individual being vaccinated, that very well may be true, as you point out."
14768,"But for society as a whole, the risks of doing so outweigh the marginal benefit."
14769,That was my point.
14770,"*This goes for people traveling across multiple states or going far out of their way to get a vaccine; for example if you live on the border and it makes sense to get the vaccine from a neighboring state or county from a logistical or practical standpoint, that I can understand."
14771,But flying halfway across the country to get the vaccine earlier is a fucked up thing to do.
14772,It puts everybody at greater risk.
14773,Fauci is fine for me.
14774,He's  a celebrity but I fully trust him.
14775,"I'm aware, but putting Thunberg on that list is like putting an iphone on the list of ""best android devices""."

14786,*
14787,What was the point of having clinical trials then?
14788,With all these nasty variants floating around it’s imperative that we stick to the script and provide people with the best amount of protection as possible.
14789,On what exactly?
14790,"I see people, workers, fearing eviction, fearing starvation."
14791,So is the $1200 directly to people good or bad?
14792,"I see states and cities, unable to run deficits, unable to hire medical workers to administrate vaccines, So is money to states, designated directly to these costs good or bad?"
14793,"Tell me, what?"
14794,Way to reinforce ranorn227’s comment
14795,We most definitely have enough vaccine without a full J&amp;J order.
14796,"We need maybe half, probably less."
14797,Which is awesome to think about.
14798,"This virus already had an R0 estimated to be 5.7, 50% more virulence makes it 11.4."
14799,So on average one person can infect 11 people.
14800,"It’s also airborne, aerosols can travel through AC, they can linger in the air, and this one can survive on surfaces for up to a month."
14801,I don’t think people are as clean as they think they are.
14802,"And if you really wanted to prevent infection, you still have a 5% chance of being infected through your eyes."
14803,There’s a reason healthcare workers take so many precautions with it.
14804,"Hell, they found the damn thing on food after it was frozen."
14805,It really is a monstrosity.
14806,"I read if we change our surfaces, at least in stores, to Cupric Ion that it will only live 4 hrs."

14810,"If you look at the genome, that intermediary would have to be minks, cats, dogs, or some other domestic animal."

14817,The last group is large.
14818,Many medical workers are getting the vaccine today that have had the virus.
14819,You can acknowledge reality.

14828,"[Sure](https://www.mako.co.il/news-lifestyle/2021_q1/Article-2eee140a5945771027.htm)

&gt;Are you saying that a lot of cases are coming from ultra-religious cities/parts of the cities?"
14829,A lot of hospitalizations and deaths.
14830,"Cases even more so as the Ultraorthodox have a TFR of 7, they have enormous families living in very small apartments."
14831,"Add on top general in compliance and you get a party,

&gt; they are most hesitant to both vaccinate and follow social distancing 

This is a bit more complicated."
14832,Ultraorthodox are themselves split into different communities.
14833,"The larger one are fine with vaccinating, but some of the smaller ones have a very anti vaxx mindset and are very non compliant."
14834,"To a lesser effect this is true to the Arab population, they are also comparatively non compliant (less big gatherings but also less masks) and are very anti vaxx, with some Arab towns having under 3% vaccinated."
14835,You need to realize that Israel is burning through a huge wave that started before the vaccination campaign.
14836,"With the British and to a lesser effect the SA mutations spreading throughout the population, this has led to increased hospitalization of younger people."
14837,Do you have a single point of evidence that this happened anywhere??
14838,"I know that in Italy, they had to leave dead people in their homes due to either staffing issues or worries about disease spread."
14839,But they weren't starving to death because they ran out of food; they died of covid.
14840,And they weren't barricaded
14841,You keep on telling yourself it was the geography that made the difference.
14842,"Funny that closing borders is apparently an obvious move, and yet the US and UK both never thought to do it."
14843,And the UK is even an island!
14844,Kind of speaks to the level of incompetence it took to do this badly.
14845,But all the evidence says it was poor governance and a messed up culture that doomed the US at least.
14846,"After all, closing the borders wasn't enough for NZ or Australia."
14847,It took massive lockdowns and extremely high compliance with the rules to achieve it.
14848,"You're right that it could never have worked in the US, but not because of geography."

14873,US cases are dropping.
14874,Holiday surge is over and hopefully the whole thing will be done as more and more get vaccine.

14878,Not saying that those vaccines are useless or don't have any advantages in some situations.
14879,But for the US which is expecting 400 million doses of Pfizer and Moderna vaccines if i were a US citizen I'd be pissed if i were getting the one that doesn't work as  well from the company that sold cancer causing baby powder.
14880,I'll believe their promise of 100 million by June when I see it actually happen.
14881,"It's one thing for a company to fall a bit short of their projections, as Pfizer and Moderna both did to some extent, but J&amp;J missed theirs by 90% or more."
14882,"Time will tell whether J&amp;J can really ramp things up to 100m by June after such a slow start, but I've noticed that a couple of the experts on the news shows have been pushing the message that we'll have enough vaccine even without J&amp;J."

14916,"&gt; this is common for any virus to evolve into becoming more infectious, less severe, etc."
14917,This is a common (slight) misconception.
14918,"Viruses don't mutate to become less severe, they mutate to become more infectious."
14919,"Sometimes becoming more infectious means becoming less deadly, because a dead host doesn't spread the virus."
14920,"But sometimes becoming more infectious does lead to becoming more deadly as well

I'm not trying to be alarmist about this, though."

14937,"Once we missed that window, we had already lost the fight."
14938,The US is simply too big to control it after that without draconian lockdown response that would neither have been legal or politically viable for either side.

14940,it's both a good and bad thing i guess.
14941,Yeah it’s under 0.8 with many restrictions in place.
14942,That rate doesn’t validate getting rid of mask mandates.
14943,Herd immunity should be the goal before getting rid of masks which is like the least offensive restriction in place.

14982,"I went to the store one day, and saw like 1/3rd of shoppers not wearing them, as if just because we have vaccines now it means this  magically disappeared."
14983,"Kind of annoying, but this bit of news makes me hopeful."
14984,Because I would answer that question in a way you are saying is affirmative when I'm not happy with it.
14985,"Because you're putting fucking words in my mouth you condescending, out of touch... Troll."

15000,Geographical advantage is honestly where I think most of it is.
15001,All of those Northeast states are tightly linked through highways and several densely populated cities.

15003,"Florida’s cities are nowhere near as packed, are more spread out, and only one of them breaks the top 20 largest cities for size."
15004,Maybe.
15005,But even if more mild does seem to affect more systems in the body than the flu.
15006,I’m sorry but I don’t believe this feeling is actually that widespread.
15007,Like I doubt people aren’t gonna be socializing on a much bigger scale once cases are negligible and most older people are vaccinated.
15008,My mom has been in basically a complete lockdown due to being very high risk and once she is vaccinated at the end of february she is going back to living her life.
15009,People keep reading headlines about what public health officials recommend and projecting that view on others to get mad imo.
15010,Think about the fact that most people already were socializing in some capacity when cases and deaths were far worse.
15011,I find it hard to believe that people are going to be opposed to people socializing by may.
15012,Question for those who might know: how concerned should we be about the virus’s mutations potentially affecting vaccine effectiveness?
15013,I was doing ok until I lost two people I knew this week.
15014,"And not permitting your own citizens to return, even when dying or to see dying family."
15015,And not allowing your citizens to leave.
15016,Hardly a success.

15018,"We can use similar principles for covid, if a variant comes up that resists vaccines to a significant extent."

15028,Are you actually kidding me right now?
15029,There’s an entire section dedicated to it and there’s enough evidence for WHO to acknowledge it.
15030,Literally even the CDC even confirmed it.
15031,But yeah some random reddit user named klocks knows better than all these doctors and scientists.
15032,"Keep living in your fantasy world, peace."
15033,You’re missing the forest through the trees.
15034,There’s no history of medical experimentation on “black bodies” (lol at that dehumanizing phrase) in other countries.
15035,Yet vaccine acceptance is similarly low.
15036,Even within America the acceptance of vaccines is tied directly to education and income.
15037,"https://www.thelancet.com/journals/eclinm/article/PIIS2589-5370(20)30239-X/fulltext

Race is a weak proxy that no one talking about vaccine acceptance among black people in the US is admitting."
15038,It’s convenient that the US committed illegal experiments on black people throughout history.
15039,It’s not reality that this is the reason black people in every other western nation are less likely to get vaccinated.
15040,"My point is, you don’t fight black anti-vaxx conspiracies by assuaging fears of the Tuskegee experiment."
15041,Rather you fight it with education on what the vaccine does.
15042,These deluded assholes need an awakening.
15043,They should be glad I was not on that line.

15045,I really have to wonder where people like this get their information.
15046,"It's bad enough that they process something like a 5 day lockdown as draconian, but the information is just wrong to start with, so it's like a double fuck up."
15047,Came across [this](https://theconversation.com/how-mrna-vaccines-from-pfizer-and-moderna-work-why-theyre-a-breakthrough-and-why-they-need-to-be-kept-so-cold-150238) article which talks about how future generations of cells can't replicate the mRNA.
15048,"""While this synthetic mRNA is genetic material, it cannot be transmitted  to the next generation."
15049,"After an mRNA injection, this molecule [guides the protein production inside the muscle cells](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3597572/), which reaches peak levels for 24 to 48 hours and can last for a few more days."""
15050,"That makes me feel better that the blast radius is small, just enough to get the immune system prepared to fight the spike proteins."
15051,Let's hope there aren't many variants of the spike proteins!
15052,And then the goal posts will shift
15053,Pro-death protesting is new.
15054,Do you seriously not know?
15055,How old were you in 2002?
15056,And yet the spread is being dropped.

15059,All of that to avoid acknowledging that most people are content with their healthcare.
15060,So strange.
15061,Yeah this dude didn't do anything wrong.
15062,"If anything, a bit more process rigour around staff working in these quarantine hotels is in order."
15063,Seems a bit odd to have people floating around these places for work and then just heading home and into the community.
15064,My deepest condolences to the family people we got to start taking this more seriously
15065,I'm wondering if they're making an analogy by comparing microchip manufacturing to vaccine manufacturing?
15066,There’s two cases I’ve seen where people did did somewhat suspiciously a couple days after getting a vaccine in the US.
15067,That being said it’s possible they would have died anyway and even if that’s not the case 2 out of 22 million is pretty good odds.
15068,Definitely better odds of dying from covid by several orders of magnitude.
15069,That would definitely make the problem worse
15070,"To be fair, usually when governments announce a lockdown for a specific amount of time it ends up going on for much longer than that."
15071,"I mean, the dude equates the use of vaccines resulting in the expected outcome with this notion that vaccines work."
15072,Def.

15081,Economic recovery will not occur overnight.

15084,"Hope for the best...we are less than a year into this pandemic, and things are looking up, a bit."
15085,"Stay as safe as you can, this won't last forever."
15086,Florida’s climate is pretty comparable to Southern California which is kind of recovering from one of the worst outbreaks to date in the US despite one of the strictest lockdowns.
15087,Maybe we just don’t have that much control over a respiratory virus.
15088,"controversial opinion, but I think at this point, the more people who get vaccinated the better regardless of who they are."
15089,"Of course there should be people who are prioritized, but to be honest its not so straightforward who those people are."
15090,Should a teacher get the vaccine so an entire classroom full of kids can return to school and their parents can start working again?
15091,Or should it be a type-1 diabetic who is at a higher risk of severe illness?
15092,"what about the hospital donor - if the special treatment means a new wing for the care of others, who is to say that isnt worth it?"
15093,"The closer we get to herd immunity via vaccination, the better."

15111,Little rant here about COVID death numbers.
15112,Really hope I don't come off as a conspiracy theorist.
15113,New York City was a major covid hotspot in the beginning of the pandemic.
15114,Tokyo is also a major international city hit by the virus.
15115,"Now, take New York's population density and compare it to Tokyo's."
15116,You'll find that Tokyo's population density is about 2.5 times the population density of New York.
15117,"As of May 1, 2020, New York reported about 13,000 total deaths, while Tokyo only had 97 total deaths."
15118,"This means that the ratio of covid deaths to residents of New York would be 1:669 people, while in Tokyo the ratio is 1:237,000."

15212,"Source: CDC and WHO

Dear teachers,
Us parents always back your unions and speak out for raises, levies on the ballot, etc."
15213,But guess what?
15214,You’re fracturing the alliance between teachers and parents.
15215,"And as a government paid employee, us tax paying parents won’t stand with you much longer!"
15216,Just a warning... do with it what you will.
15217,"My mom’s a teacher, one of the good ones."
15218,But I  see now  that the saying “one bad Apple spoils the bunch” really does apply here.
15219,Especially with union politics involved.
15220,Get back to work if you care an iota about our kids!
15221,It’s been a year!
15222,They’re suffering irreversible damage!
15223,So help me understand something.
15224,Once I get the vaccine I’m safe from COVID?
15225,Or I can still contract Covid without spreading it?
15226,Or I can spread it but not get infected?
15227,What exactly does the vaccine do?
15228,Covid hasn’t been nearly as much of an issue in a lot of poorer countries because the general age group there is younger
15229,American kids are overweight
15230,Even in New Zealand we would consider this to be a very intense reaction to a single case.
15231,"We have had 3 cases of the South African variant escape quarantine facilities in the last week or so, with one woman going on a holiday around Northland visiting 38 locations while symptomatic."
15232,"But we didn't even institute any social distancing, just let contact tracing handle it."
15233,I guess WA doesn't have any experience with cases slipping past quarantine so this is scarier for them.
15234,So help me understand something.
15235,Once I get the vaccine I’m safe from COVID?
15236,Or I can still contract Covid without spreading it?
15237,Or I can spread it but not get infected?
15238,What exactly does the vaccine do?
15239,2% of Washington’s hospitalization cases have been Pediatric.
15240,"And the entire state only has 750 Covid patients in the hospital right now, so I’m going to call bullshit on the one."
15241,"Vitamin D doesn’t slow down infection rate, just the severity of the infection."
15242,This made my whole week!!
15243,I’m so happy for y’all and can’t wait for more widespread distribution.
15244,You mean you DON'T go through 48 rolls of toilet paper in 5 days?
15245,Aaannnd now we take you to the board for the US.
15246,Looks like we've got a 2 or 3 second streak goin - Nope.
15247,Just reset.
15248,And again.
15249,"Ok, here we go the US has now gone 5 seco - scratch that, we're back at 0."
15250,"You know what, let's cut to commercial and we'll come back with an average for ya."
15251,Keep him in a bubble until his 2nd vaccine.

15253,I believe you can’t mandate a vaccine that is only “emergency use approved”.

15256,"Forgive me for being frank, but I’m so over stupid people."
15257,I’m sick of it.
15258,"This year has made me lose respect for so many people - family, friends, coworkers, etc."
15259,I have been consistently shocked by the willingness to believe debunked conspiracy theories and outright object certified science.
15260,I’d be so pissed if I were unable to get my vaccine because a bunch of prideful and uneducated morons prevented it from happening.
15261,It’s sad you cannot clean the air....Though light can.
15262,"Please keep in mind, even once you are vaccinated you can still be a carrier!!"
15263,Very scary that the blinders seem to be going up once people are themselves safe!
15264,Bingo
15265,It only takes a handful of point mutations in the right places for a virus to completely evade an immune response.
15266,You don’t need to seriously change the spike protein.
15267,"If that’s what you got from what I said, go ahead and be obtuse."
15268,I hope you get better!
15269,Be blessed 🤠
15270,"This is good, right ?"
15271,Utter idiots filling the shops everywhere.
15272,Panic buying resumes at full pace.
15273,5 days.
15274,People are shopping for a year.
15275,I’m curious to see the post Covid world.
15276,J&amp;J was also tested during new variants and in South Africa.
15277,We're in a different pandemic now than when pfizer/moderna were tested.
15278,So some deaths are more important than others?
15279,Yeah but this is the first time in modern medicine we've had a virus that infects potentially a billion.
15280,"Given a large enough petri dish, many mutations will occur - the real question is whether our new mRNA-based vaccines and some sense of herd immunity will counter the reproduction rate enough to curtail exponential growth."
15281,The flu operates in an ecosystem which it's equilibrated into.
15282,We'll see if covid does the same.
15283,I hope not.
15284,Because the variants that we’re finding have been confirmed as being actually functionally different than the wild type strain.
15285,Some can spread faster and/or do a better job of getting around a pre-existing immune response.
15286,"There's a strong public health consensus in the collective conscience of West Australians, and really most Australians."
15287,"We still have our contrarians and crackpots, but the general mood here is that it sucks, but it's necessary."
15288,"Just knuckle down, work together, and get to the other side in one piece."
15289,Could be better I suppose?
15290,"This is the original goal of Operation Warp Speed back in May 2020: “According to a CNN report on 1 May, which the source who spoke to Science confirmed, Warp Speed intends to deliver the first 100 million doses of a vaccine in November and another 200 million over the following 2 months.”"
15291,"The title of the FDA’s own webpage is “Drug Recalls”


https://www.fda.gov/drugs/drug-safety-and-availability/drug-recalls"
15292,It’s pretty horrible.
15293,"And yet when parents say their kids are suffering, the get told they are awful ppl who just don’t want to parent."
15294,I’m honestly speechless.
15295,It's theorized we need 70%+ for herd immunity.
15296,"Also, the newest variant in brazil is capable of reinfection of those with natural antibodies."
15297,[https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(21)00183-5/fulltext](https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(21)00183-5/fulltext)
15298,I wonder how much people are claiming they should get paid for internet/electricity costs when working at home?
15299,"Also, with PPE in such high demand, most State’s if they enacted any laws pertaining to safety will just say the “as long as the Employer made the best efforts to secure PPE at the normal cost.” Then you can expect your employer to not give a crap unless they have a heart."
15300,Yeah I don’t bother with the flu shot period so any comparison using that as a base is irrelevant to me.

15318,"It won’t necessarily be the end of it, but I think when summer rolls around we will be in a much better place assuming we vaccinate more (and we should with J&amp;J being approved soon)."

15321,Well duh
15322,Thank you.
15323,Might have ended in a ban.
15324,You did the right thing.
15325,I'm also frustrated with my fellow Americans.
15326,[removed]
15327,They were also unlucky and 60% of the first production batch has failed.
15328,EU might get 30 million vaccinations instead of the planned 80 million they had purchased for a third of a billion euros for the first quarter of the year.
15329,Shit happens.
15330,It could have happened in the UK or the US but it didn't.
15331,Why is that?
15332,"My only reaction was arm pain which became swollen armpit, assume the lymph nodes there."
15333,"I didn’t say anything about lockdowns

As far as masks you could find studies that will fit your point of view."
15334,"But most studies show that masks offer some protection from infection 

Do the mask nutters go to far?"
15335,Yes.
15336,Right now as I type this I saw a woman walking her dog by herself wearing a mask.
15337,But if I’m going into a 7/11 for instance it makes my blood boil if someone is in the store without a mask.
15338,Wear a fucking mask.
15339,It’s just a fact that masks offer some protection.
15340,April to may-june depending on state.
15341,Victoria had a second long and harsh lockdown from July to October.
15342,&gt; How big would AstraZeneca's shortfall be if the US and EU had both approved the vaccine in December?
15343,"No different, since the only stipulation is that the doses need to be provided by Q1 2021."
15344,"first, I don't want to discount what those people are facing, it's awful and those with various post-viral syndromes have always been forced to deal with lack of adequate care."
15345,it's my hope the pandemic will spur researchers into figuring it out.
15346,"that said, those syndromes end, though it may take a long time, and they're essentially rare outcomes in people with so-called mild disease."
15347,"long haul symptoms are very highly correlated with hospitalization, which itself is correlated with age, and the vaccines, even J&amp;J, stop that from happening 100% of the time."
15348,"we vaccinate the most vulnerable, which should be done by this spring, we eliminate the societal risks of long term disability from covid."
15349,"The fact you are constantly using phrases such as “emotionally invested” and “narrative” while downplaying vaccines suggests you are not raising this point in good faith, and are a troll"
15350,What underlying conditions do they take into account?
15351,Is it the same as the flu vaccine?
15352,"Some of these guys drive 100s of miles to buy their favorite soda pop, its big fuckin Texas, makes sense."
15353,"During phase 1/2 they did frequent measures, not sure if everyday"
15354,I can only dream of getting a vaccine by April
15355,"The UK is basically a boat on fire and rather than put out the fire, they've hooked up a big engine to get them to a dock quicker."
15356,That's not necessarily a bad goal but you're boats going to have a lot of extra damage.
15357,How about this?
15358,"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2P8gq41ghKQ

Very few people are wearing masks (except for the Police)"
15359,I'm very sure I heard on bbc news that UK put their order in and the rest of the EU was 3 months later ordering theirs?
15360,&gt; EU never signed a contract saying shipment of initial doses of any vaccine currently approved in Europe should come from either US or UK.
15361,"The EU/AstraZeneca contract specifically mentions 4 production sites, 2 in the EU and 2 in the UK, from which the vaccines are to be supplied."
15362,Housing density and multi generational homes.
15363,The virus has been worst where housing is vertical.
15364,"Just anecdotal, but my sister is a nurse in a primary care physician’s office."
15365,They have had multiple patients die of COVID-19.
15366,Each and every person of color that works in her office refused the vaccine.
15367,"This needs to be noted in the HR file, they need to sign a release that the hospital/clinic is not responsible for any infection, and we move on."
15368,I agree with another poster who said we cannot make special accommodations for them forever.
15369,They are 100x worse than the antimaskers.
15370,"At least the antimaskers want an end to this madness, though not at the proper time."
15371,"Also, you’d get less depression when being with antimaskers than if you were with people like what OP talked about."
15372,"There is absolutely no way 95% of people there are under 30, Not even remotely close and it doesnt much matter if you're outside when everyone is drinking."
15373,All of them packed together shouting at each other face to face placing bets on races arguing back and forth about who won or didnt win.
15374,The source didn't say anything like that.
15375,&gt; No idea.
15376,Yet you complain about intellectual honesty and reading comprehension.
15377,You don't know shit yet have opinions that you insist are right.
15378,"Up in Bellingham I just got my second dose, I was in there for just over 15 minutes."
15379,"I walked in, sat in a chair, got vaxed, then sat in an observation area for 15 minutes."
15380,"They were also very clearly ready to double the amount of people they're doing at a time, over half of the chairs in the waiting area were not being used (and they were all spaced appropriately) and there was a way more cubicles on the actually Vax area for people to give out the shots."
15381,Probably just waiting on supply!
15382,[deleted]
15383,Not really.
15384,UK ordered first and had an airtight contract.
15385,EU ordered late then wanted delivery first.
15386,EU was trying to steal UK doses.
15387,"Serum antibodies, plus for convenience all major studies use multiples of 1 week (7 days) for reporting"
15388,Anything that’s opening now is staying open.
15389,We’re at the point of no return so to speak.
15390,We’re opening restaurants at 25% tomorrow.
15391,The vibe here in Michigan is if in a few weeks they’re all told to go back into their caves you will see many if not most just say fuck it and chance  the fines.
15392,This is just so sad :(
15393,"Is this the story I heard a few months ago where they examined tissues of people back then who died with these kind of symptoms, but weren't identified as anything unusual?"
15394,[deleted]
15395,"Nobody can force them but it's not a case of ""Eh maybe I'll book the second maybe I won't""."
15396,Everyone gets scheduled in for the second and will receive a reminder and possibly an angry call from their surgery for not turning up.
15397,Missing appointments without good reason can get you unprioritised for future appointments.
15398,Blowing off appointments gets you put at the back of waiting lists.
15399,Natural selection... Just like in Montenegro this past summer.
15400,Stay strong!
15401,That does not add up.
15402,"Either the ""brewing"" takes ."
15403,"months and AZ learns late about low yield, explaining their late notice."
15404,"Or it takes but a few days or maybe weeks, then AZ could have fixed it without much fuzz."
15405,Fixing *after* causing that stirr just does not make any sense at all.
15406,"Also, if the production cycle is short, then why did they lose so much of their production at once?"
15407,"""I cant find a fucking PS5."""
15408,Abraham Lincoln
15409,"And if they take vaccines out of the UK order, would that not be breaking a contract too?"
15410,I don't know why you're so keen to pin the blame solely on AZ when it's pretty clear the European Commission's handling of this has been shambolic.

15412,🥅➡️➡️➡️➡️➡️➡️🥅
15413,"In the event of a possible breach of contract that is compromising the vaccine efforts in the EU, due to a possible stock leak, it had to be done."
15414,"But it was diffused quickly, and suddenly the production capacity of AZ is improving and more vaccines will be delivered after all."
15415,"Actually, Portugal now has the highest death rate worldwide since the British variant is rapidly spreading because of travelers from the UK."
15416,"Due to the AstraZeneca shortfall, vaccination has almost ground to a halt now."
15417,The headline is a bit misleading
15418,Yet another thing*
15419,"I’m sorry, it’s definitely been a rough year in the pharmacy world, and I took it personally when I shouldn’t have."
15420,"We definitely need all the staff we can get, and if we could pay a competitive wage it would give us the staff."
15421,"Just as there were “there is no pandemic” people, I feel there’s going to be “there’s still a pandemic” people well after we reach 70% vaccination."
15422,Ikr.
15423,It is a countries first job to protect the lives of its citizens.
15424,"US will be done vaccinating in the summer, then the supply will be sent to other countries."
15425,"People just like to criticise the us a lot, but don't give much thanks to all the US involvement in vaccines for the world...pfizer, moderna, novavax, j&amp;j all would either not exist or not have manufacturing capacity without US."
15426,"We finally found an upside to Brexit, boys!"

15433,Funny I have been there maybe 8 or 10 times and have always wanted to live there.
15434,Besides the Covid situation what sucks about it?
15435,[deleted]
15436,The contracts are per quarter though and Pfizer/Moderna have said that they will fulfill them.
15437,Canada is just getting their doses at the end of the quarter instead of at the beginning/middle.
15438,Canada was giving a weekly number of doses they expected to receive in January to March but that wasn't in the contract.
15439,The contract was 4M Pfizer doses in Q1 and 2M Moderna doses in Q1.
15440,I haven't heard that Moderna/Pfizer have diverted any doses from Canada to US.
15441,Do you have a source for that?
15442,As far as I know Canada's Moderna doses come from Spain and our Pfizer doses come from Belgium.
15443,US doses come from US.
15444,This guy economics.
15445,[removed]
15446,First time I have heard this that does not sound right.
15447,Something lost in translation?
15448,You're right (still not tested s at 12 weeks though).

15452,&gt;UK went nationalistic and forbid or hinted at forbidding exports of vaccines.
15453,Not even a little bit true.
15454,Totally false.
15455,"&gt;Say thanks to Trump and BoJo for that

UK is giving away the IP for the Oxford vaccine for free and AZ is producing at cost."
15456,"So yeah, maybe thank the prime minister"
15457,Maybe soap irritates the injection site?!
15458,I know like 10 ppl who have been vaxxed and no one mentioned that!
15459,Chances are this one won’t hang around his neck.
15460,He said it’ll happen in the next 6-14 weeks.
15461,Fourteen weeks is mid May.
15462,If we have a third wave that bad in May the eyes are going to turn on to the medical community because we should have quite a bit of vaccine coverage by then.
15463,It doesn't mention any amount of people in Budapest protest so I think you may have misread.
15464,Though I do see this continuing to go up as people cannot grapple large amounts of daily cases/hospitalizations/deaths for a year unless it affects them personally.
15465,It is as if people are thinking that this is the world's first vaccine.
15466,We have had vaccines for hundreds of years specifically so that we can protect ourselves from illnesses and have a functioning society without worrying about getting sick from each other.
15467,We don't take our kids to get vaccinations for small pox and measles and then bring them home and lock them in their rooms to make sure they don't spread those diseases around.
15468,They are vaccinated specifically so they can go into society.
15469,The policy makers and people like Fauci have lost their way in the name of caution.
15470,If you perpetually take the most cautious stance on everything you will never leave your bedroom in the morning.
15471,Summer of 2018 was the best
15472,"I know it’s a pipe dream, but once Covid cases/hospitalizations/deaths start plummeting, I would love to see a corresponding plummet in humanity’s reliance on social media."
15473,That's down to government incompetence.
15474,How about ….
15475,they've partially fixed the issue of low yield.

There's your first mistake, thinking Reddit is in any way representative for the population."

15484,"&amp;#x200B;

&gt; Osterholm, the director of the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy at the University of Minnesota, told “Meet the Press” that he expects to see a new surge of infections “in the next six to 14 weeks,” thanks to the spread of new variants like the one first discovered in the United Kingdom."
15485,"Looking at an increase in hospitalizations in the U.K. during the spread of this new variant, he predicted another surge in the U.S. will usher in “something like we have not seen yet in this country.” 

That is slightly concerning for American's."
15486,Yeah all we had to do was go back on our word to supply vaccines to the EU.
15487,🤷‍♀️
15488,"The problem with such so-called ""noble lies"" is that they can backfire extremely easily."
15489,"Not only could this cause some people to believe their own bullshit and keep us locked down for a lot longer than needed, it could also even reduce vaccine uptake."
15490,Think about someone on the margins between pro and anti-vaccine.
15491,Telling them that their life won't change at all and that they can't protect others by taking it makes them a lot less likely to take the vaccine.
15492,The talking point is bullshit and they should just be honest with us.
15493,Or just come up with a way to show proof of vaccination
15494,There's no way we can vaccinate the entire world.
15495,Not to also mention there's leader like jair bolsonaro who are anti vaxxers
15496,&gt;AstraZeneca previously said it will not profit from its COVID-19 vaccine during the pandemic and has stated prices ranging from $3 to $4 per dose—the lowest price announced for a potential COVID-19 vaccine so far.
15497,"However, terms of a deal with AstraZeneca disclosed by the Financial Times show that there are limits to AstraZeneca’s public “no profit” commitments, and that the company has given itself the power to declare the pandemic over as soon as July 2021.

15503,"There is a total of 70,000 Palestinians working in Israel, and beyond that the two populations pretty much don't have any contact whatsoever (with the exception of the small Jewish community in Hebron)."
15504,This is less than 1% of the Israeli population.
15505,Those numbers are completely insignificant in terms of herd immunity.

15511,Reading comments in the other threads in this sub about people crying that the US is “hoarding” vaccines when we have only vaccinated 10% of our population is maddening.
15512,They really think we should be giving our supply to other countries right now.
15513,In what world does that make any sense?
15514,Unfortunately that’s not true.

15815,August is not too late when you expect the deliveries in February.
15816,"Even if the deal had been made way earlier, the production could still have been messed up."
15817,AstraZeneca has said nothing about the order coming in too late.
15818,Yawn
15819,"Canada had to actually order from Europe/EU production, as both US and UK went nationalistic and forbid or hinted at forbidding exports of vaccines."
15820,Therefore they are in the same boat waiting for production to ramp up.
15821,Say thanks to Trump and BoJo for that.
15822,"Youre still not fucking there, dumbass."
15823,Stop acting like you know everything
15824,Or private corporations.
15825,"In the US, the federal vaccine program was done (under Trump) as a public-private partnership, i.e."
15826,giving shittons of money to national pharmacy chains.
15827,"49 states signed up to that, and are vaccinating relatively slowly."
15828,"West Virginia, normally a very conservative, Trump-y state, decided to let their state government deal with it, and within a few weeks had shots in the arm of every healthcare worker and every care home resident."
15829,Combination of factors most likely.
15830,"Immunity from past infection, seasonality, increasing amount of vaccinated population."
15831,"Ah ok, probably not by summer then."
15832,Do they not plan on purchasing Novavax at all then?
15833,Would of thought they'd be pushing to get Novavax to make up for the shortfall currently
15834,[deleted]
15835,Canada total has received just 1.1 million vaccines.
15836,The US is administering more than that each Day.

15843,Look at testing from last year and tell me how the government wouldn't set a target they can't reach
15844,Maybe you should pay attention better.
15845,"&gt; The Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine, which has only so far been approved in the UK, is produced in three factories."
15846,"&gt; Two of them are in England, at Keele and Oxford, while another is in Leiden, in the Netherlands."
15847,&gt; Large quantities of the liquid are then taken to specialists in Wales and another in Germany to divide it into vials or bottles.
15848,"So, let me summarize it for you."
15849,"There is a supply chain on the continent, factory in the Netherlands bottling in Germany and this was used for the first doses of the vaccine the UK got."

15851,That’s why you hear so many governments see to be panicking.
15852,They know the clock they’re racing is dictated by voters.
15853,You can have your favorite epidemiologist in the world say we can’t do a certain activity.
15854,It doesn’t matter.
15855,Restrictions are ultimately political decisions.
15856,Same here.
15857,Los Angeles.
15858,Will be staying with family in Scotland for some of the trip.
15859,We have two hotel stays that they wouldn’t refund us last year but have a voucher for.
15860,To be honest if Scotland is back open.
15861,"Like really open: museums, pubs, restaurants then we’ll likely go."
15862,"&gt;no doubt though that they’re probably moving faster and increasing capacity more urgently than they were before

This is exactly what the article says too, and the people the EU had inspect the sight confirmed the plant issues that AZ just said are now fixed."
15863,The extra doses are just from that.
15864,We're a year into this.

15877,NYS expects to vaccinate the general population in the summer.
15878,Or hows about he says I'm sending these 100mil doses down south?

15883,I'd expect a significant drop in deaths now.
15884,Please explain how someone who is 'mind bogglingly stupid' is capable of getting a Masters in Economics from Cambridge?
15885,Let's also remember that there was a little thing called WWII happening around that time as well.
15886,"That's related but in the case of a pandemic, all the practicing medical professionals who make up the frontline workers of the medical reserve corps are already busy dealing with the pandemic."
15887,"There are enough of them, maybe, to deploy to isolated public health crises but not a nationwide crisis, and we've just seen the reality of that over the past year."
15888,"The military reserve has over 1 million members who are not professional military but have other kinds of professions, and we have the draft on the books to deal with a wide-scale war but there is no equivalent to these for a pandemic and there clearly needs to be given we've lost more people in the last year than for all 4 years of WWII."
15889,We need a corps of volunteers from outside of the medical fields who are trained appropriately for medical and non-medical pandemic work.

15891,"Also the amount of excuses they come up with as to why it's ok for the UK and US to keep everything for themselves but it's bad if the EU does it (hint, it isn't , it's still exporting), is laughable."
15892,"That’s because this is being led by the NHS, rather than someone in the Tory party’s mate"

15900,Read up on this and the blood telegram.
15901,"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2005/jun/29/india.usa


This and the sanctions put on india when they developed nuclear weapons had poisoned the relations so much."
15902,"American diplomacy doesn't care about ""values"" as much as they would like to make people think."
15903,They supported a millitary authoritarian nation over a democratic secular one.
15904,Supporting pakistan got them closer to China who Nixon was trying to cozy up to and get out of the spehere of influence of USSR.
15905,Also fun fact india was the leader of non-aligned movement during the cold war and had not picked a side but was forced to do so when NATO sent aircraft carriers to assist pakistan.
15906,We’ve also started the extremely vulnerable group too as my dad who is in that category received his today :) Things are looking hopeful!

15908,"Well, when there are no vaccine providers in your county, and you don't want to wait for if/when they get out to the rural areas, you sign up for waiting lists as far away as you are willing to drive, and go to the first one that offers you an appointment."
15909,My neighbor drove over 3 hours each way for her first vaccine.
15910,Luckily we were able to get an appointment with a vaccine hub just over an hour away.
15911,Post a pic of your self m8 or otherwise stfu
15912,Gotta use those fema camps for something
15913,That's why it's called a supply chain.
15914,"To be fair, it’s sort of both."
15915,A lot of people want to go somewhere but don’t want to waste their money for a lesser experience or having to wear masks everywhere while on a vacation.
15916,I would love to travel right now but I only want to experience these things as they were intended ya know
15917,Well imagine how much time you won’t have to waste if society was more efficient.
15918,That’s the point.
15919,Covid has pushed us into adapting more efficient models for getting things done.
15920,Of course you could take a away from my post that I’m happy covid happened cuz my kid’s picture day doesn’t take that long but only someone with the critical thinking skills of a five year old would think that.
15921,Delivery point isn't where the current hold up is.
15922,It is unlikely to ever be where the hold up is with this virus.
15923,Vaccine production is where the hold up is and problems with  the distribution system and rules.
15924,There is actually a huge capacity for putting shots into arms if there are enough doses.
15925,It will also take about a week or so to be effective.
15926,These reports have been coming out for some time.
15927,So there isn't really a change here.
15928,"What *is* a nice change is that there are clearly efforts aimed at trying to actually help states organize their distribution (e.g., the federal Pfizer/Moderna exchange marketplace for states that have weaker cold chains) and the ramping up of federal resources to aid distribution if required."
15929,Right now we appear to be starting to be supply constrained.
15930,"Hopefully Moderna and Pfizer are both able to hit their original promises in terms of timelines - if so, they need to start shipping a lot more doses per day (2.5 million a day, not &lt;1 million a day we're hitting right now)."

https://www.euronews.com/2021/01/13/covid-vaccine-from-factory-to-arm-the-logistics-of-rolling-out-the-oxford-astrazeneca-jab"
15933,That's not how I've seen it.
15934,"Plenty of EU Redditors have been very willing to blame the UK and the US, even on articles that are reporting the exact opposite of what they're telling everyone."
15935,"Friday was probably the worst for it, I even got downvoted for providing sources when I told them they were wrong."
15936,Although it seemed to calm down a bit after the EU  managed to piss off Ireland.
15937,"There's no point in convincing these people, they're practicing british nationalism through defending AZ."
15938,"How someone can defend the fact that AZ isn't able to deliver 60% of contractually agreed doses is beyond me, regardless of what the EU is doing"
15939,"&gt;Note, Japan hasn't updated the number of PCR tests performed since January 28th, 

Based kn what happened before, the test numbers tend to be delayed by 3~4 days, was it?"
15940,"Or, it makes people less likely to understand that they are sick and thus more likely to go around spreading the virus."
15941,"Omg this whole comment is even worse than the first one, I just can’t 🤣🤣🤣"
15942,Americans as in the citizens?
15943,"No idea, I'm a Brit so don't have to think about how much medical care costs."
15944,As a country?
15945,You will get AZ at costs as the UK mandated no profiteering under the license.
15946,You can same the same thing with a different tone
15947,In a couple days we'll cross the milestone of more first doses than positive cases.
15948,The UK is the nation testing the most among major European countries.
15949,It'll speed up massively.
15950,The UK has an extra 400m doses ordered that it won't need that will probably go to the commonwealth and the EU.
15951,And as more vaccine types come on line (especially single dose ones like J&amp;Js) the more there are to go around
15952,Also vaccinations for people with underlying conditions - I'm one of them and am booked in for Wednesday.
15953,&gt;They already did it last year.
15954,"""Sorry UK we're unable to ship the 30M doses we promised, but we're shipping 4M doses from the EU pre-production stockpile your way!""."
15955,"&gt;  
&gt;I do wonder where they're taking those 9M doses from."
15956,"As a EU citizen, I'm really sorry!"
15957,"No, they didn't."
15958,They sent the UK produced vaccine into the EU to be filled and fitted.
15959,"basically, put into bottles."
15960,"The commission looked into this already, and hasn't mentioned it since because the accusation is bullshit."
15961,That's still good it could hopefully mean pressure is taken off other plants and hopefully no one experiences any delays then
15962,&gt; The rest have simply been given one dose.
15963,"They are not vaccinated

They are vaccinated, they are just not fully vaccinated."
15964,There's a very good reason to believe that giving 1 dose to twice as many people will save a good deal more lives.
15965,"This isn't a political decision, it's what the governments own scientific advisors have recommended."
15966,I guess it's over then.
15967,:-(
15968,"Late signing a bad contract, late paying upfront money after everyone else, late in construction of manufacturing plants leading to ongoing problems during rollout and late in authorising it for use."
15969,And all of that compounded by making asses out of themselves trying to divert the anger towards the UK and then risking peace in Ireland.
15970,Mistake**s**
15971,It’s not only about the AZ vaccine.
15972,Pfizer is supplying Canada from the plant in Belgium because the USA doesn’t allow exports.
15973,Cool story bro
15974,Go to vaccine contracts tab
15975,"Lockdowns work, but many countrys didn't have strict enough ones."
15976,For eg here in the UK the schools have not long closed.
15977,Most people are getting on packed buses every day to go to work or working in packed factorys.
15978,"I dont care what any says, making bouncy castles, parfums, anti ageing creams or window cleaners or upholsterers are not critical workers for the economy!"
15979,Big fuck you to my mans Justin Trudeau and his team for raw dogging us up here in Canada.
15980,Loves me these sunny ways
15981,Yeah it just becomes another flu.

16021,the only raison d'etre anymore is to piss off bitter conservatives
16022,The UK has a relatively big pharmaceutical industry for its size and the UK government threw money at AZ to ensure they would have as complete as possible a domestic vaccine supply chain to avoid potential disruptions (ironically they were actually worried about Trump rather than the EU).
16023,The UK based factories are just barely keeping up with the speed at which it can be injected into people at present.
16024,But they will ramp up production and soon the UKs Novavax production sites will be up and running in addition to the Moderna deliveries arriving in spring.
16025,So hopefully they will soon be in a better position to start exporting vaccines.

That depends on who you consider the most vulnerable, the UK has only just passed the half way mark of it's top 4 vulnerable groups (of 9), groups that make up over 90% of the deaths from Covid."
16062,It has taken over a month to get 14% of the country 1 of the 2 jabs.

16097,The more you know!
16098,"We need a three year study and some peer reviews, and then..."
16099,It's infinitely easier during lockdown
16100,"No, I wouldn't."
16101,"Fuck you all, you aren't my responsibility."
16102,Here is a quote from the Uk on the topic.
16103,The vaccine from the Netherlands was bottled in Germany and then sent to the UK.
16104,"&gt; Ian McCubbin, manufacturing lead for the [UK] Vaccine Taskforce, said

&gt; “The initial supply and it’s a little bit of a quirk of the programme actually comes from the Netherlands and Germany,” he told reporters."

16106,The J&amp;J vaccine will most definitely get us back to normal.
16107,"It eliminates 85% of the severe cases, all of the hospitalizations, all of the deaths."
16108,"In fact, it may even be better than that given enough time."
16109,J&amp;J is also investigating whether a 2nd shot would boost the numbers even further.
16110,The J&amp;J vaccine alone would have been good enough to return to normal.
16111,That doctor is an idiot if that's what they said.
16112,"&gt;We took a slower and more precise approach for the sake of our most vulnerable

😂😂😂"
16113,It is our political leaders who fucked up.
16114,"Rather than weigh _all_ factors, they gave absolute power to experts in a very narrow specialty."
16115,Public health experts are obviously going to mostly care about saving as many lives as possible.
16116,That's their job.
16117,"Just like economic experts are going to mostly care about jobs and economic growth, psychiatrists are mostly going to care about mental health, artists are going to care about keeping museums open, and so on."
16118,It's the role of public policy to weigh **all** of these competing concerns and decide on the best possible course of action.
16119,Our leaders abdicated their mission by acting as if the only valid goal was maintaining longevity at all costs.
16120,Of the 20 contries with the most vaccinated people 11 are EU countries.
16121,"Out of the top 30, 20 are EU."
16122,"Its not great, but not nearly as bad as everyone makes it sound."
16123,[deleted]
16124,It's very clear what the best effort clause means: AZ can be relieved of its contractual obligations if it fails to develop a vaccine or if the vaccine fails to get approval.
16125,"Since the AZ vaccine has been approved, AZ now has to supply the EU just like it has to supply the UK, ie."
16126,100 million doses for the EU in the first quarter 2021.
16127,"Failing that, it is in breach of contract."
16128,All contracts for a vaccine that hasn't yet been developed contain a best effort clause.
16129,That is standard practice.
16130,Not Swedish.
16131,But you do you.
16132,I guess it depends where you live.
16133,Here around Kungsholmen i see a lot of people with face masks on the buses and in the supermarkets.
16134,Mostly under 60s though.
16135,Whether a country is wealthy or not is based on gdp per capita otherwise I guess Liechtenstein is a poor country?
16136,China is a middle income country.
16137,As demonstrated.
16138,Any attempt by the UK to unilaterally assist Ireland using their surplus vaccines would clearly be blocked by the EU.
16139,It sounds like states are hoarding them based on the *possibility* of future shipment delays.
16140,"That sore arm, we meet again old friend."
16141,Thanks!

16145,No one is making you fly with them.
16146,social distancing isn't law and they aren't required to do it.
16147,Don;t like it don't give them business.
16148,The airline can't keep doing social distancing to make you comfortable unless they want to go bankrupt.
16149,"Actually, Kate Bingham is a tory party mate."
16150,It's just that she also happens to be quite good at getting shit done too.
16151,I'm optimistic for this to happen.
16152,I can see all restrictions lifted by the end of June.
16153,"Alternatively, I can see the population as a whole ignoring whatever restrictions remain by that point."
16154,It's likely the rest of the world will be lagging behind so summer will be a different occasion in other countries.
16155,"A good old-fashioned, unrestricted, staycation looks to be in order."
16156,Here's several articles about how schools are low risk.
16157,"https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/news-perspective/2021/01/scientists-highlight-low-risk-covid-19-spread-schools

https://thehill.com/changing-america/well-being/prevention-cures/536060-cdc-says-risk-of-coronavirus-in-schools-is-small

16158,Do you have figures that investment has gone down or that they have said they will not invest higher each year.
16159,"Its *up to* 12 weeks -

 and as another redditor said would you rather have 100 people at 60% or 50 people at 90% protection?"
16160,It makes sense.
16161,He's a liar.
16162,"&gt; The EU had spent just €1.78bn in “risk money”, cash handed to pharmaceutical companies without any guarantee of a return, compared to €1.9bn by the UK

Given that Germany alone put in at least 2 billion in risk money , this does seem to exclude member state money."
16163,As always these stats only include direct EU funding to distort.
16164,Same shit different day.
16165,I don't know.
16166,I hope when I'm 75 people people are reasonable enough to think of my life.
16167,The CTU is resisting going back to schools at all this year and potentially beyond that.
16168,That is at least 4 more months that they are pushing to stay out of classrooms.
16169,ok i'll play.
16170,"the reports of people being reinfected with variants or getting infected with two variants at the same time are always gonna sound scary, and great for driving up clicks."
16171,but they're not real data.
16172,"we've seen stories about people dying from the vaccines plastered all over the place, when these individuals make up less than 100 out of millions and millions of people."
16173,but of course they make the front page.
16174,fear sells.
16175,"anyway, let's take those who are concerned about variants and reinfections at their word."
16176,"lots of very highly respected experts are talking about it, after all!"
16177,let's even assume something really scary- let's say these South African and Brazilian variants make people 50 times more susceptible to reinfection.
16178,"you know how many people that leaves with strong, long-lasting protective immunity?"
16179,"still the vast, vast majority of people who have contracted covid."
16180,"additionally, reinfections with Coronaviruses tend to be less severe than original infections."
16181,"this is why many experts believe that COVID will become the next endemic coronavirus, and the variants we're detecting in places like Brazil is part of that process."
16182,there is no evidence of complete immune escape and you need to take a few deep breaths.
16183,That's why covid absolutely needs to become deadlier.
16184,"I am not up to speed on the National Observer of Canada, but my sources are more recent and I very much doubt the World Health Organisation (referenced in the BBC article) is a British propaganda mouthpiece."
16185,"Understood, I’ll check that out!"
16186,no its cause: no western study=worthless mentality
16187,&gt;Yup.
16188,"We are doing that in Saskatchewan, Canada."
16189,We have used 108.04% of our delivered doses.
16190,"Yup, over 100%."
16191,we had a chance to make domestic vaccine.
16192,trudeau was even offered it but he turned it down.
16193,look it up
16194,How would that work?
16195,The factories in the EU are the ones having problems setting their production lines up.
16196,That's the whole point.
16197,I guess they could block exports of the Pfizer vaccines if they really wanted to escalate the situation.
16198,"But stealing every single dose that the UK still hasn't taken delivery of would barely make a dent in the EU's shortfall, let alone let them vaccinate the whole of Europe in a couple of months."
16199,make it thrice with P.1 brazillian variant.
16200,There's a list on the government website.
16201,The largest number of conditions are in tier six but for more serious conditions I seem to remember they are in tier four.
16202,There's quite a list of conditions because the virus can target a number of organs in some cases.
16203,Why have there been no doses given?
16204,Is it still being trailed?
16205,[deleted]
16206,Captain Sir?
16207,This man has all the accolades
16208,"thats normal, it can even happen at the same time, you can even have the flu a cold, norovirus and 2 covid strains at the same time + more"
16209,"So now there are congressmen, nurses, etc.. people who have been vaccinated, testing positive for covid."
16210,"And a big question I have is, do these vaccines actually prevent the recipient from catching covid, or does the vaccine just (hopefully) keep the recipient from getting sick if and when they do catch it?"
16211,There is the case of the congressmen this week as an example.
16212,"And there were medical spokespeople in the articles saying ""that's how the vaccine's supposed to work - he's asymptomatic"""
16213,It and similar independently evolved P.1 in Brazil escape.
16214,Not debatable.
16215,The question is to what degree and what effect on live humans.
16216,Staff being vaccinated is not part of CTU's demands.
16217,"CPS has already approved more teachers than they are required under the ADA, which is the statute that would cover people who would need accommodations due to covid."
16218,The CTU has conceded this point.
16219,The CTU demands are in no way reasonable and are contrary to public health recommendations.
16220,It is a blatant ploy to keep teachers out of schools as long as possible.
16221,"This is the actual demand list that CTU came out with

https://www.ctulocal1.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/CTU-Demands.pdf?fbclid=IwAR1irwNv4okukO5kr8BAezau0JvuBWGbl0uHdEaUzmfOeSejh7i64WnrDLY

Also CTU teachers have not been treated like garbage, they are some of the highest paid with the least amount of oversight and the worst performance in the country."
16222,Because it’s Reddit and Biden is now president lmao
16223,Go UK!
16224,Keep it up.
16225,This is 4x the US rate.
16226,That plus First Dose First means you are on pace for roughly 8x as fast to herd immunity.
16227,Or they could just teach in person because schools are low risk.
16228,"&gt;Canada had to actually order from Europe/EU production, as both US and UK went nationalistic and forbid or hinted at forbidding exports of vaccines."
16229,&gt;The issue with vaccines is production.
16230,That’s were they don’t help.
16231,But have fun with the propaganda.
16232,Aww that's adorable!
16233,The vaccination centre I work at recorded the most we’ve done in a day yesterday.
16234,We absolutely smashed them out all day.
16235,Everyone was literally going as fast as they safely could all day.
16236,"So many of the patients coming through everyday say things like, “don’t let me hold you up!"
16237,"There are lots of people that need this after me!”

It’s great that everyone is in it together!"
16238,It’s also one of the few things in the country that’s actually going better than we expected!
16239,Nothing stops you from going on a vacation within the US today.
16240,I visited Arizona and Nevada in December and January.
16241,"Nobody tried to stop me, and I had a great time."
16242,Thank you for the thoughtful response and I'm truly sorry for your daughter being left behind during this pandemic.
16243,I understand there are no good solutions.
16244,Requiring teachers to work without being fully vaccinated adds unnecessary risk or health and safety for the educator and at a time when we can wait a month to do it safely.
16245,I fully feel for your daughter and family.
16246,"At the same time, your perspective that they should be working is very specifically: you choosing the health of your daughter over the health of the teacher."
16247,Reminder - worst pandemic in 100 years.
16248,"""If teachers are going to skip the line and get a vaccine, they can go back to work."
16249,"They just moved the goal posts to be that all adults and children need to be vaccinated before they will go back."""
16250,Agree.
16251,"Obviously this is district-by-district, but I believe teachers should be first in-line for vaccine and then go back to work - or skip the vaccine and stay remote."
16252,"Sounds like we are aligned, i just would wait until teachers have both vaccines + 14 days."
16253,With regards to the IDEA act.
16254,"With all due respect, bringing this up in January 2021 is quite simply unreasonable."
16255,You are not alone.
16256,"330 million Americans are making sacrifices and losing a year of their lives, in some case the last year of their lives, because of the pandemic."
16257,"Literally everyone reading this and everyone not reading this, around the world, has made gigantic sacrifices."
16258,I strongly support all rights for the disabled  - but those rights need to be put into context during COVID.
16259,"Finally, I recommend you read ""The Two Income Trap,"" by Elizabeth Warren."
16260,It sounds like you've found yourself in the trap.
16261,"If I were in your shoes, I would have one parent staying home."
16262,"In fact, that is what I expect of nearly all families with children during the pandemic."
16263,"Please sacrifice some money and find a way to keep one parent home to raise your child during these difficult times, rather than sacrificing a teacher to maintain two careers."
16264,I know this is not easy in America - and I am more making a statement against the American system (including healthcare) rather than your personal circumstance.
16265,That's what my family did.
16266,My wife is an immuno-compromised teacher of kids young enough that social distancing is unrealistic.
16267,It has been clear that since March no one cares about her health.
16268,She took the year off and we have sacrificed her salary for her health and safety as well as that of our fellow Americans.
16269,"Re-entering the profession is a question-mark after what we have seen with regards to lack of care for educators by parents, administrators, and the general population."
16270,"I say all this with love and compassion, and really do appreciate you sharing your perspective."
16271,Thank you!
16272,I don't get that.
16273,"If you don't want the vaccine, fine but don't stop other people from getting it."
16274,[removed]
16275,Whose joking?
16276,Another counterpoint to the people who accuse US of hoarding.
16277,"US has the most deaths, so shouldn't other countries be giving their vaccine to us?"
16278,The fact that WHO doesn't recognize Sars-CoV2 airborne and thus allows countries to do the same is a joke.
16279,"Not just because the evidences rejected, but even as an abundance of caution, it just wouldn't be bad; what could it possibly do?"
16280,*Reduce* cases further?
16281,"Yeah, talk to a real lawyer please."
16282,"'Best resonable efforts' was especially meant for the case, that the vaccine doesn't work."
16283,"You use it for projects, where its not clear if the project target can be fulfilled, not as a 'you get out of jail free' card for breaking deadlines or not fulfilling the contract."
16284,As you should know as a lawyer.
16285,"Ah yes, the miracle doses"
16286,80% uptake would very good.
16287,Plus not everyone who does have it will be anti vax such as pregnant women and people with underlying health conditions.
16288,You do know the military has doctors and medical staff in it right?

noun

a registered user of the website Reddit."
16297,I was talking about an unknown number of people on Reddit.
16298,"If I meant representative of all people on Reddit, I would have just used Reddit."
16299,The UK probably could've bought their own vaccines without leaving the EU because they still had sovereignty.
16300,"Either way, the EU really screwed up here."
16301,I think it’s down to each area and how many people are showing up to receive the jabs.
16302,"Some places seem to have a few leftovers from what I’ve heard, so some surgeries are just carrying on down the age brackets and others are giving second doses."

16304,No it doesn’t.
16305,Super Bowl parties are nowhere near being celebrated as big as thanksgiving or Christmas
16306,"It would have been but for the variants, at least according to this article."
16307,That is simply not true.
16308,All vaccine contracts contain a best efforts clause for the case that a company fails to develop the vaccine.
16309,The best effort applies to AZ's obligation to the EU in the same way it applies to its obligations to the UK.
16310,That’s all well and good but what about the second dose?
16311,"If her model is correct and California faces a 0.9 R right now and the B117 strain is 50-70% more transmissible, then sure."
16312,But right now California’s R looks to be more like 0.7 or 0.8 and it’s possible the strain is only 20-30% more susceptible.
16313,I would like to see the model with those assumptions for comparison
16314,Reread the thread please.
16315,Yup.
16316,That’s why it was so puzzling that Biden *immediately* broke the promise that won them the Senate and said people would have to settle for $1400 instead of $2000 when he was negotiating against... himself.
16317,AZ would have to complete EU contract first.
16318,These should be distributed around the EU per population.
16319,Sadly no spare Oxford-AZ for the rest of the world.
16320,The real answer is not because of any logical principle.
16321,"It is just because of the fact people were using the virus's origin to blame China for the existence of the virus, and some people perceived that this was contributing to xenophobia and racism against Chinese people."
16322,"There hasn't been any similar wave of xenophobia against South Africans, Brazilians, or British people as far as I know."
16323,"(No comment about whether this reasoning right or wrong, just that that's the argument)."

16331,I went to a school for impverished youth.
16332,I was one of the more well off students at the school so I was forunate enough to avoid the worst of poverty but at lunch I would go around with one of my friends collecting people's apples (they cane with our lunch but a lot of people didn't want to eat them) to fill her backpack so she would have something to eat for dinner/over the weekend.
16333,My high school boyfriend's mom was a heroin addict and his stepdad would shoot nails through his arm with a nail gun.
16334,I graduated in 2012 and probably half of my classmates didn't have internet at home.
16335,Most of them had highly abusive home lives (as did I).
16336,Very few parents gave a single fuck about their kids.
16337,"Sure I don't work with impoverished youth as an adult, but I grew up in it."
16338,It's not like I don't know what it's like.
16339,must feel nice with all those vaccines they steal from EU
16340,Punishment for disobeying lockdown = lockdown.

16343,Yup.
16344,Im always incredibly proud of the NHS but this is incredible work from them
16345,"Well I disagree with you and the points you make, and arguing further is pretty much a waste of time."
16346,"I will be living life naturally and not pay attention to these restrictions, and I guess you should stay at home"
16347,What’s the latest on when the general population will have access to vaccines in the US?
16348,I keep reading different things.
16349,What do you mean by open environment?
16350,"Btw you don’t measure the efficiency of masks by comparing different cities, states or countries and their mask usage."
16351,There are so many other variables.
16352,Let’s say you have covid and you go into a 7/11.
16353,Are you less likely to spread it to others if everyone is wearing masks?
16354,The answer is if you’re wearing a mask your less likely to spread infection.
16355,We know this because of dozens of studies just like this one.
16356,https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMc2007800
16357,UK propaganda.
16358,"This is the reality:

https://www.nationalobserver.com/2021/01/28/news/eu-health-official-blasts-slow-vaccine-delivery-canada"
16359,Probably not as many anti-vaxxers as that in the UK.
16360,But a significant number nonetheless.
16361,"No, they didn't."
16362,"Go ahead, if you're so confident, find where they said it."
16363,"You wont, all that was reported was what the EU said to the media."
16364,"And considering the EU publicly lied about the contract (notice how they've shut up after they released it), I'm not going to blindly trust them."

16374,Five different members of staff came over at different times to chat to her because she was being sociable and smiley.
16375,Her little face was ecstatic with the attention.
16376,"That sort of pleasure of social interaction and even her opportunity to see people other than her two parents (and her grandmother who does childcare), I really miss it."
16377,I honestly would have said pre covid that I’m antisocial (I am never a fan of extended social interaction) but bloody hell id rather have it now; then not have it at all
16378,of course.
16379,i've recently rediscovered a love for reading and writing.
16380,there's definitely somewhat of a good side to all this
16381,"You’re about two days behind, the EU backtracked pretty severely."
16382,No vaccines are being blocked and the UK’s supply is just fine.
16383,Ah british propaganda pieces.
16384,"How about the real stuff:

https://www.nationalobserver.com/2021/01/28/news/eu-health-official-blasts-slow-vaccine-delivery-canada"
16385,That was on Tuesday.
16386,Almost a week ago.
16387,VdL is re-announcing it now.
16388,Worth threatening Northern Irish peace for that?
16389,Probably not worth it.
16390,"It takes time, the time you don't have, it might not work out."
16391,"But most important of all, it won't be enough."
16392,The EU wants 10 million AZ deliveries per week.
16393,What can the UK produce?
16394,Maybe two million per week eventually?
16395,That's not even gonna put a dent in the shortages if it has to be shared with the UK.
16396,AstraZeneca just massively failed with their task.
16397,Not a lot can be done about it now.
16398,AZ received 330 million Euros and 8 months to produce 120 million vaccines to their best reasonable effort.
16399,They made that deal with the EU.
16400,Reality: 31 million vaccines.
16401,"The fact that in many places (including where I live), they'll lock everything down for 1-2 months, then let up for a bit, them another lockdown for a couple months, and on and on for almost a year now."
16402,It's too much man.
16403,A life like this is not worth living.
16404,The statement is without any context of time frames or what ultimately happened.
16405,That's not the sign of quality journalism.
16406,It's a sign of a hit piece.
16407,"UK Medical experts vs rest of world medical experts, vaccine manufacturers, Israeli vaccination &amp; infection data, etc."
16408,"Haven't discussed it with everyone I know, but I assume they'd side with the larger group of medical experts."
16409,In the interview with the AZ CEO it was clear that it's come from the EU production line improving slightly faster than expected.
16410,"Probably AZ have let Von Der Leyen publicly declare it as a win to allow her to save face, but it would have happened anyway."
16411,Sadly all the same person :-)
16412,Which Government procured the vaccines we're using right now to support the NHS?

16427,"What's interesting to me is that his predictions have been perfectly accurate to the speed of distribution, and I wouldn't be surprised if we were around 100,000,000 doses distributed by the end of February, especially with more vaccines on the way."
16428,This is also accompanied by a precipitous drop in new cases and hospitalizations.

16431,"That's incredible, even if we could and should demand better."

16433,There are people hurting because of the restrictions and if we get to the stage where hospitals are not overwhelmed and cases go down substantially there is no reason why we should have these current restrictions.

16444,"Yes, it will take a long time for the last restrictions to dissappear, but when the last ones go away we will read it in the news and think ""hey, there was still restrictons?"""

16447,"The rolling average is now 1.3 million shots a day, and will likely go above that soon."
16448,"This is a little pedantic, but they were using titers for these measurements."
16449,"Titers do not directly measure antibody concentration, rather they’re a measurement of how much you can dilute serum by and still have detectable binding to a given antigen or epitope."
16450,"IMO the simplest way to conceptualize lower antibody titers to the new variant is that the existing antibodies are less sticky to the variant, so you need more to stick to it equally as well."
16451,It’s not like existing anti-COVID IgG levels in vaccinated or convalescent patients suddenly decrease 2-6 fold on exposure to the new variant.
16452,Rather their existing antibodies don’t stick to it as well.
16453,[removed]
16454,It’s shocking that successive governments of both major parties didn’t view this a threat to national security and public health.

16468,The UK had zero involvement.
16469,"Here are the funding details:

&gt;Funding: Fosun Pharma has invested $135 million with BioNTech, and another $50 million in exchange for 1.58 million shares of the company."
16470,"The German government gave BioNTech €375 million ($445 million towards its COVID-19 vaccine program, while the European Commission and European Investment Bank has invested €100 million ($119 million) in BioNTech's vaccine program."
16471,Pfizer and BioNTech did not take development funding from OWS.
16472,Those are just surges.
16473,"We never left the first wave, cases never decreased enough to get it under control."
16474,Israel is a good example of a country with 2 waves for reference.
16475,I hope we can bar hopping this Saint Patrick’s day in March!
16476,Last years was so much fun before lockdown.
16477,Hoping more get vaccinated so we can go back to normal.
16478,"Not sure if this is entirely true,but theres a mutated variant of covid which is more transmittable in people of younger ages."
16479,And it might be even deadlier but not sure.
16480,I'll research it a bit but if I was the one taking the choice I wouldnt reopen them because its such a risk.
16481,The only way to find out how it plays out is to wait till Monday.
16482,Let's hope that it won't take a toll for the worst.
16483,"BioNTech, a German company, was hugely important."
16484,Florida also has an older population.
16485,20.5% of the population is 65+ vs. New York at 16.4% (https://www.prb.org/which-us-states-are-the-oldest/).
16486,And we know age is the most significant comorbidity.
16487,"That said, I agree with you on NYC given those factors (along with the fact that it was likely widespread there before it really hit Florida)."
16488,That's why comparing Florida to Massachusetts might be a more fair comparison.
16489,"I don't believe in conspiracies, on the right or left."

16511,Thank you for pointing this out!
16512,We have no vaccine that even approaches 50% effectiveness against the flu.
16513,"It’s 60% effective against illness, but against spread, it’s pretty abysmal."
16514,"There’s also the structural reasons why flus mutate so damn fast, as well as all of the species specific versions that recombine in livestock, all things COVID lacks."

16516,"They're talking about the UK, not US..."
16517,South Africa was one of the most locked down nations in the world.

16540,They deal with diseases much more severe every year
16541,Pakistan gets 90% of its other vaccines from India anyways since India supplies 50% of the global vaccine supply.
16542,Trade between the two got cut off after the recent tensions but medicines were exempt.

16550,Just a correction.
16551,California's COVID death rates are much lower than Florida... 100 COVID deaths per 100K vs. 120 for Florida.
16552,https://www.beckershospitalreview.com/public-health/us-coronavirus-deaths-by-state-july-1.html
16553,Do you have any interests outside of covid?
16554,No.
16555,This is completely wrong.
16556,What else is new across the channel ...
16557,It mutates.
16558,Yep
16559,"See, I agree that our lockdowns were pretty weak (forget China, we didn't even support our soft lockdown by properly funding people and services)."
16560,"But I would argue even so, the summer lockdowns worked."
16561,"In fact, Florida's summer wave was worse than California's in part because DeSantis refused to shut down."
16562,"We saw the same thing in Arizona and Texas, two other states that refused to shut down for a while."
16563,"When they did shut down, they bent the curve successfully."
16564,"In contrast, I believe by October onwards, lockdowns were entirely ineffective."
16565,You can look to California as the exemplar here.
16566,"We had tight restrictions, but everyone I know was still socializing in small groups."
16567,And it got chilly enough that those were held indoors.
16568,"Yes, Californian weren't going to superspreaders at bars."
16569,"But there was enough community spread that between essential work and socializing indoors, we saw exponential spreading."
16570,So here closing businesses doesn't really make sense.
16571,(This is to say nothing of the baffling closing of outdoor dining which doesn't seem evidence-based at all.
16572,"I suspect this was  an attempt at ""signaling"" by Newsom but it was a miserable failure.)"
16573,Ultimately a state's response depends on its citizens.
16574,"If they aren't being responsive to state policy, then the state is limited in what it can do."
16575,"I see a lot more pop-up and 3rd party sites tho, and how does that explain 25% of hospitalization down?"
16576,"To be fair, this person isn't assuming it'll stay the same."
16577,"They're assuming 1.7 million shots/day, vs our current rate of 1.3 million/day."
16578,&gt; 95% efficacy means 5 out of 100 ill not be protected.
16579,"That's not right, actually."
16580,"You are still protected from serious symptoms, including hospitalization and death."
16581,It's 100% effective at preventing that.
16582,It's just not 100% effective in stopping you from getting it.
16583,It's 95% effective at that.
16584,Then that should be the lead.
16585,I have trouble singling out Sky here because all media outlets are selling fear.
16586,"It's been know by many, and I have several of my friends/family who are healthcare workers in FL reporting this, that they're DRASTICALLY underreporting and have always been underreporting cases and deaths in FL."
16587,"Any comparison to NY, CA, etc."
16588,is moot.
16589,"If the data is skewed, you always have an argument for ""lockdowns don't work!"""
16590,"For people saying DeSantis is right, well yeah he's right..."
16591,According to his data.
16592,"It's the same way Trump propagated his lies: use fake data and you'll never be ""wrong""."
16593,I'm mystified by some of the comments here.
16594,"Yes, the ""goal posts"" are moving because we're getting more data."
16595,"My colleagues and I were told in March 2020 to expect to be back in May, then October, then January 2021, then June 30th 2021 and that will probably be extended to November 2021 at least."
16596,"Also the posturing comments like ""if you think I'm going to put up with restrictions for  'x' more months you're crazy"", are kind of just beyond to me."
16597,"Many folks haven't been adhering to restrictions in general so none of us whom are following restrictions will be surprised or triggered by your lack of adherence, so go off."
16598,"My best guess for ""normal"" with no masks or distancing is June 2022."
16599,"I'll be happy to be wrong, but that's my guess."
16600,In your opinion are the measures used these past 10 months necessary?

- the attack rate of the first wave was a lot less than estimated, in which case the IFR for the first wave must also be higher - there were many fewer asymptomatic cases than we thought."

16733,Not if your goal is to shoot blanks.
16734,Vaccines don't always prevent transmission.
16735,"Many do, and based on other similar viruses, we have reason to believe that this one will, but it was tested for a reduction of the presence of symptoms, not reduction of transmission."

16746,I don't know why people's risk tolerance is suddenly ass now.
16747,Covid floating with a severity suddenly like the flu in five months from now is a manageable risk.
16748,Stop intermingling what you want to happen and reality.
16749,"Well, don't oversell it."
16750,There are huge error bands there if you're looking at a 95% confidence internal.
16751,"In the control group, only a couple people ended up dying and only a small group ended up hospitalized."
16752,It's definitely promising but more data is needed to determine precise protection from hospitalization (and death).
16753,I think an 85-90% reduction in hospitalization and death is very reasonable assuming it is correlated to severe symptoms.
16754,"Definitely a game-changer at least in terms of truly turning it into ""just the flu bro""."
16755,99-100% protection is probably unrealistic.
16756,"Regardless, these numbers are more than good enough for general (18-49) population."
16757,Save Moderna and Pfizer for high risk groups.
16758,Too late.
16759,Most vulnerable are already all dead.
16760,Thats also reason why death rate may slow down too.
16761,No one there anymore to die.
16762,The barrier of entry to nursing isn't as high as you probably think it is.
16763,"&gt; If I hear the bullshit of 'its an island' one more time ...

People seem to ignore that the US basically closed its land borders and restricted international travel to a small handful of countries."
16764,Infection of 25 million people already seems high.
16765,"&gt;	In England, as many as 1 in 5 people, or 12.4 million, are estimated to have had the Covid-19 disease
&gt;	The estimate is substantially higher than the 2.4 million confirmed cases from Public Health England, which is based on reported tests alone

[As many as 1 in 5 people in England have had the Covid-19 disease](https://www.edgehealth.co.uk/post/as-many-as-1-in-5-people-in-england-have-had-the-covid-19-disease)

Of course that’s for England alone, but you’d have to add the whole populations of Wales (3.1m), Scotland (5.5m) and NI (1.9m) having been infected to get close to 25m for the UK."
16766,The caveat of course is that this is just one study.
16767,Because fold change normalizes the results.
16768,"For instance, 6 fold decrease from 100 is 16.67 which would be a 83.3% decrease."
16769,"But, a 6 fold increase from 16.67 to 100 isn't an 83.3% increase...it's a 500% increase."
16770,"I notice on world death charts, that deaths drop significantly on the same two days of the week each week I suppose it could be staffing related, but, any other ideas?"
16771,It's odd.

16820,the northeast had the majority of their deaths in the initial wave and have done better once they started locking down.
16821,Florida didn’t get hit hard in the first wave but had a bunch of people die in subsequent waves from not taking covid seriously

16888,You'd expect a number of covid deaths comparable to a year (6-24 months) of normal deaths if most of the population had caught it.
16889,South Africa is very far from that.
16890,My assumption is they're in panic mode and are keeping R&lt;1 through distancing and economic sacrifice.
16891,Bloomberg update: 30.5 million.
16892,1 million vaccinations atleast on a saturday.
16893,Idk why they can’t just determine if people are getting reinfected or not.
16894,If there was herd immunity you have at least 70% chance of finding someone who had covid and can say as such.
16895,Did the people going into the hospital now go to the hospital on the first wave?
16896,New people?
16897,Not that difficult to figure out just fucking ask
16898,Why does paying early mean very little?
16899,"It pays for expansion of capacity, and as that takes time, the earlier you pay, the earlier the company can expand."
16900,"Also, I was never at any point saying AZ didn't screw up their supply to EU (hard to know if it was this or overconfidence)."
16901,I'm saying that big lumps of money make building things possible.
16902,Good management and planning mean remarkably little with no cash flow.

16908,Pandemics are tricky as obviously data from that far back is hard to track but from my research under 100 years have been during a pandemic.
16909,Which is less than .2% of humanity’s span so far.
16910,Someone can feel free to correct me on that but I hope that helps out things in perspective.
16911,Pandemics of the last hundred years usually go a year and change.

16917,I’m feeling good about it.
16918,That small town has x4 the people of my small Canadian city
16919,Blame all the people who still don't give a shit about the virus after a year.
16920,Yup.
16921,That’s why I said “more safely.” They could still wear the mask and everything to keep transmission possibility lower.
16922,Just makes sense to me to have at least one person per household/family vaccinated to be able to help keep things afloat.
16923,&gt;employers will put safety ahead of profitability and do the right thing.
16924,"If 20% of nurses opt out, suddenly losing a fifth of the staff isn't going to be good for patient safety."
16925,"Keep in mind that 20% of the population has been naturally infected, some of those nurses may be trusting their natural immunity."
16926,"Natural immunity doesn't produce high levels of antibodies, I would choose vaccination to prevent reinfection."
16927,"But second infections are more likely to be mild due to T cell immunity, and memory cells that rapidly restart antibody production."

16948,I have no family nearby and obviously can’t make new friends.
16949,"I obviously wish that I could do more and I can’t wait for this to end, but I would say I’m coping fine."
16950,I’m not depressed or anxious.
16951,I keep busy and make sure to spend a lot of time outside exploring the area where I can.
16952,It’s not a foregone conclusion that people living alone and not near a support network at completely unable to cope with this.
16953,It’s an epidemiology study.

16956,"To be honest, I’d prefer if it went on unbridled."
16957,This is the silent part people who wanted a China-style or Australian-style lockdown aren’t acknowledging when they attack people who are against them.
16958,"When they say they want that style of lockdown, that also means they want the US government to take power it doesn’t have and implement things it isn’t legally allowed to implement."
16959,The people who are uneasy about this are uneasy about the government doing this.
16960,But these lockdown people never acknowledge that.
16961,"Instead, they just paint everyone that disagrees with them as sociopaths that want to watch people die."
16962,It’s gross and dishonest

16987,You do know you can still transmit the disease if you're vaccinated?
16988,Interesting tidbit from nate silver we need around 3 million a day to have two doses delivered to 80% of the population by June
16989,"Honestly, imo that comes off as really spoiled people."
16990,"And its infuriating, while they have access to vaccines the pandemic and risk is still high here, maybe for another whole year."
16991,"This has taken a heavy toll on my mental health ngl, having an immunossupressed dad that lives with me and my 60yo mom, we have been basically in our home 24/7 since early march of 2020."
16992,Those are real vaccines.
16993,Do you think I'm making this up?

I have both of those vaccines."
16997,Smallpox and Polio.
16998,I don't have to go back and get new vaccines every year.
16999,They stop transmission and symptoms.
17000,"Oh, and I didn't get a lesser version of Polio for a while after I took that one."
17001,This is a Covid shot.
17002,Not a vaccine.
17003,Just like the flu shot.
17004,It may or may not help.
17005,But it doesn't stop transmission.
17006,People have given up...
17007,"So it has nothing to do with ""herd immunity"" not working."
17008,Thank you for dispelling bullshit claims and undoing a clickbait lying headline.
17009,"&gt; Definitely light at the end of the tunnel

I feel like that's a bad choice of words when talking about a nursing home"
17010,we’re gonna need a bigger boat
17011,"I don't want federal agents enforcing masks, weed, immigration, or just about anything else."
17012,I was pointing out that a federal law for something as trivial as masks will simply be ignored by the states.
17013,"At this point, US is issuing over a million jabs a day and more vaccines are coming online in the following weeks."
17014,The writing is on the wall.
17015,Covid19 has been sentenced to die and is on her way to death row now.
17016,Gestures like this are just a way of gathering credit for when the inevitable happens.
17017,They are symbolic in nature.
17018,Cool.
17019,Thank you for taking the time to respond!
17020,Same with my moms school.
17021,I was worried for her but they really haven’t had many cases but they did upgrade their entire hvac system in all schools.
17022,I know a lot of districts that don’t have the money to do that.
17023,"Pandemic is not hitting in the same way the third world compared to countries like USA, UK or Germany, so, I think the priority is the first world because they spread the virus faster since they travel a lot more."
17024,Say this is fear mongering garbage is just a stupid attempt to deny the reality and actually a reason why we're still in this after a year.
17025,"Last I heard, J&amp;J was only going to have about 10 million doses available at the end of March."
17026,How was the testing carried out to back this up?
17027,I assume this report was carried out under Redfield?

17030,It certainly does make it a bit more difficult for the US to criticize human rights violations without sounding a bit hypocritical.
17031,Soo now we know who’s at fault
17032,"honestly, if someone is that dumb, I really don't give a fuck anymore."
17033,"They probably already don't trust the vaccine if they hate the government that much, so give the people who want the vaccine it in a more efficient way so maybe the rest of us can get it sooner than the current system."
17034,SHORT JNJ
17035,Schools are safer because you have real authority to actually boot out non compliant students or staff members.
17036,"Plus, it's weird but students are much more compliant then the general population when it comes to rule following (because guess what, they follow rules all the time)."
17037,This is not necessarily the same with hostile people in a store who likely have a political agenda for not wearing a mask.
17038,The real issue comes from the fact that most students are spreading it asymptomatically and alot of school districts are pressuring parents not to test so they can keep the school open.
17039,"Virtual tends to result in less attendance, which results in less funding."

17049,"""I will be greatest jobs ~~president~~ governor God ever created"""
17050,Anyone underselling the J&amp;J vaccine is wrong.
17051,It's a solid vaccine that's another huge milestone in the fight against covid.
17052,Yes it's not that 90% efficiency but moderna/pfizer kind of spoiled us.
17053,Had J&amp;J come out in November before pfizer/moderna did with 66% efficiency we'd have all cheered for joy on how effective it is.
17054,Remember the FDA had a threshold of 50% efficiency for any approval and the annual flu shot is between 40-60% efficient.
17055,So J&amp;J is better than the annual flu shot and depending on the year alot better.
17056,Also its 85% efficient against the most severe symptoms and no hospitlisations.
17057,In other words even if i do develop symptoms It'll likely be minor symptoms almost like a flu and It'll keep me out of hospital.
17058,End of the day that's what our main aim should be.
17059,I don't mind so much getting slightly ill but i don't want to go into hospital or die.
17060,This prevents that.
17061,And being one dose is a huge plus point logistically speaking so it can speed things up(no calling people back for 2nd doses)
17062,"This is why the vaccine roll out is so slow: They have to sort out the age group, the race, the profession....Some vaccine literally expired because they couldn't find enough people that fit the desired characteristics while the rest of us are not allowed to have it because we don't fit all the desired characteristics."
17063,"I'm too healthy (not obese, not smoking), not old enough, not the desired race group, not disadvantaged, Gosh, I even have health insurance!"
17064,I'll be lucky if I get the vaccine by the end of the year.
17065,"At this stage in the vaccine rollout, how can you increase the amount of vaccines currently available?"
17066,It is too late to do so.
17067,The Biden response is significantly better as they have been more transparent and proactive.
17068,"Also, have you heard about under-promising and over-delivering?"
17069,"December's initial rollout was fine, but the Trump administration set the bar too high and it caused undue concern &amp; confusion."
17070,Lol
17071,Flu has been essentially eradicated this season.
17072,We could save those 150 children’s lives each year by not going back to school and maintaining masks and social distancing.
17073,&gt;Why would a restaurant continue to pay an employee who's not working?
17074,"Because the government would be covering most of or all of their pay, and not everyone is an amoral jerk and will, if possible, continue to help their employees able to do silly things like buy food."
17075,"If you need a capitalistic argument for this because you think people who don't work deserve to starve to death, if a business keeps their employees happy and healthy despite not them being able to work, those employees will be even happier and healthier when they are able to work again, and will tell other people how great their boss is which will increase business and public opinion."
17076,"Treating your employees is not just something you should do for moral reasons, it is the long-term economically correct decision."
17077,&gt;Australia had a great government response and their unemployment rate went up.
17078,New Zealand who had an incredible response saw their unemployment rate increase.
17079,And without the financial assistance they provided it would have gone up ***MORE***.
17080,That is my position.
17081,"Perhaps I did not explain it well enough, and if so, I apologize."
17082,I did not attempt to say that ***NO ONE*** would have lost their jobs and that zero businesses would have closed.
17083,My argument is that ***vastly smaller amounts*** of jobs would have been lost.
17084,&gt;So you are lying by saying the unemployment rate would not increase if the government provided assistance.
17085,"No, I'm not lying, I'm sorry you are unwilling or unable to understand that."
17086,I have already provided proof for my position.
17087,"GameStop short sellers could afford 10 yachts but now they can only afford 8 :(

17091,You sound so fucking cringe
17092,[removed]
17093,"Why don’t you just stop beating around the bush, and post this so-called science-based fact?"
17094,It's probably why the Holiday surge was so bad from Christmas/New Years.
17095,So other than that he was a perfectly healthy kid?
17096,It's always good to under promise and over deliver
17097,"Well its easy to say that  in hindsight, if you lockdown before the virus even enters the population then maybe it can do something."
17098,But it seems like the world was too late for that.
17099,"For small island nations it is feasible to having strict measures and isolate yourself from the world, because it is feasible."
17100,Thats not possible for the majority of countries.
17101,"Also, I would compare China with its neighbours, like Japan, who had light lockdown policies."
17102,"I'm not saying florida has good numbers, nothing is ""good"" in any country."
17103,When their numbers are similar to states that had lockdowns it really makes me question the efficacy of lockdowns.
17104,"And then when you add on all the extra deaths, mental health issues, and job loss that comes with lockdowns, it seems obivous they are doing more harm than good."
17105,"Of course not all states are affected equally, but what evidence says that it was because there was no lockdown?"

17236,I did that for two weeks and couldn’t even imagine doing that your whole life.
17237,Interesting aside.
17238,Read a study recently that did suggest a genetic risk factor concerning one’s percentage of Neanderthal DNA.
17239,The study was done by the people who sequenced the Neanderthal genome at the Max Planck Institute in Germany.
17240,"The study pointed to a link between high percentages of Neanderthal DNA and Covid outcomes, based of deaths of UK residents from Bangladesh."
17241,But here’s the thing.
17242,"Sub-Saharan Africans have lower levels of Neanderthal DNA than everyone else (.3 percent vs about 2 percent), and East Asians have more Neanderthal DNA than Europeans, North Africans and Middle Easterners."
17243,Yet East Asians have relatively low Covid deaths.
17244,"I don’t know, but that suggests that nurture beats nature when it comes to Covid."

17247,"Was buying something today and saw some guy come in without a mask, gave me the biggest shit eating grin while walking fast as if he was telling me he “got one on ‘the man’”."
17248,I swear people’s egos and distrust of science has seriously peaked throughout the last 5 years and I’m honestly numb to it now.
17249,For real.
17250,Just resigned to the whole situation and bought more masks.
17251,After thinking about it I guess I changed my mind too against holding out for one of the better vaccines and plan on just accepting the J&amp;J if it means getting something (anything) sooner.
17252,I think even in the worst case scenario it’ll mean LESS organ damage than getting infected fully unvaccinated at all.
17253,Yeah it’s unfortunate for sure.
17254,I just don’t see forcing people to be vaccinated going over very well and I believe it would hurt the cause overall.

17266,Let people do what they want.
17267,"Nevermind the fact that New York has more than double the deaths of Florida since last March, so not sure what your point is."
17268,It’s ok its just stupid news.
17269,We can't help people with long covid if our healthcare system is overwhelmed and thousands of people are dying per day and the economy is being crushed.
17270,It's kind of like trying to treat a burn victim while they are still inside of a burning building.
17271,I just got a vasectomy a couple months ago.
17272,Should have gotten covid instead!

17289,We need something fun that the coronavirus Karen’s didn’t ruin.
17290,[deleted]
17291,My point is that educating kids is important and holding up something that is a negligible risk for kids to prevent that from happening is wrong.
17292,"My point is that before covid came around society openly accepted the risk of all of those things listed and we made efforts to lower the risk, but continued engaging in activities that were risky."
17293,It makes no sense that we should view covid differently than any of the other thousands of risky behaviors that people engage in to keep kids out of school.

Before you say ""herpy derpy but there's a whole big area that's gray"", if you weighted this map by population that area would basically disappear."
17302,Exactly.
17303,Nothing but lies here in NYC.
17304,Yeah what was different about last year?
17305,I'm trying to put my finger on it.
17306,That's interesting.
17307,"Yeah, I could see how it could be easier target multiple different mutations with the same vaccine similar to how we target different flu strains with the same vaccine."
17308,"I'm not aware of any testing like that with the mRNA vaccines, but from what you said, there's at least some concern that it wouldn't work."
17309,[deleted]
17310,"I haven't seen this discussed, either."
17311,It's great if we can get a new adaption to the vaccine developed in weeks.
17312,"If that resets us back to doing phase 1/2/3 trials, are we then looking at least six month lag times to go through that process?"
17313,That then makes me wonder who is in the study.
17314,"Hopefully six months from now, just about everybody in the USA who wants the vaccine will have gotten it."
17315,"I guess at this point it would end up essentially being tested as a ""booster."""
17316,"It could be tested elsewhere in the world, but the US FDA seems sort of uninterested in using that data."
17317,"(See the AstraZeneca/Oxford trials, which I know had some issues, but were sufficient for many other places in the western world.)"
17318,See I thought you were leading up to some form of “distancing is just our role as humans now”.
17319,I could give a shit about flying to Greece.
17320,As long as we are cool at home I’m good.
17321,In fact take my shot and send it to some 80 year old in Ethiopia.
17322,Totally fine with it.
17323,"I suspect several areas have already reached herd immunity (via combined infections and vaccines) but if we’re talking vaccines only, It’ll be American Samoa and Northern Mariana Islands first and then Alaska"
17324,Maybe.
17325,I was driving along PCH today and there were a loooooot of people out there playing volleyball or whatever without masks.
17326,I can almost certainly tell you that most every other state will be close to normal.
17327,I live in CA as well and I just can’t be optimistic locally here yet.
17328,"Too much “mask and distance after vaccine talk.” Even NYC and Chicago should be pretty good by then, I can almost guarantee that."
17329,"&gt;Right, that's why I said we don't know if we shed the virus or not...this is a ""we hope"" version of what the vaccine does."
17330,I'm not sure you got what I meant.
17331,"What I mean is that when relevant people are asked if vaccines prevent transmission, they reply with ""we can't say it stops it"" but rarely, if ever, emphasise that the massive reduction in symptomatic cases almost certainly means that viral shedding is also reduced."
17332,It's something that is extremely easy for the layman to understand.
17333,i.e.
17334,"""this vaccine is X % effective in preventing any symptoms, therefore there's not so much virus being shed by people who do catch it if they're vaccinated""."
17335,I guess the reason might be that people might screech about there not being studies specifically to analyse this but the notion does follow basic science and logic.
17336,Less people coughing and sweating = less transmission.
17337,Likely with a government sponsored tour guide or two as well.

17339,Why not just arrest them all for interfering?

17345,Employers can require proof of vaccination.
17346,"Same for flu vaccine actually, hospitals have let nurses go for refusing to get it and they can do the same for COVID once the supplies are there."
17347,The hospital just doesn’t have a backbone or they know they won’t be able to staff if they enforce it.
17348,"I really hope we get to 3m per day, this way it'll only take 3 months to give 1st dose to 80% of the population instead of 6-7 months at current rate, here is different cases: https://twitter.com/NateSilver538/status/1355581009568346113"

17370,Do please cite your sources for this data.
17371,2015 - 2019 the US averaged about 50K deaths attributed to pneumonia per year.

17379,I got a kick out of that.
17380,That’s just wonderful.
17381,"Delightful, if you will"
17382,I’m no Trump worshiper but man is the media really aggravating on these variants.
17383,"Every story says “worrisome” and is highly dramatic; then, midway through the story is a paragraph that says it’s likely not THAT big a deal."
17384,Yeah.
17385,"If they want to protest, stand on the side of the streets holding signs, chanting whatever it is they chant, and even call me names."
17386,I don't care.
17387,Go for it.
17388,But the second they purposely prevent me from making my choice to get the vaccine you've crossed the line.
17389,"I can't imagine finally getting a chance for your vaccine, probably waiting quite a while in line, only to get turned around."
17390,Yes
17391,I figured.
17392,Darn.
17393,Thanks!
17394,"It's not his fault healthcare workers exhibited virtually no sense of urgency (as evidenced by few or no doses on holidays, weekends, etc.)"

17397,accomplished.

17399,"I'm American fwiw

There are an infinite number of ways to define ""winning"" here."
17400,"International travel is a silly one because, by definition, it is an inter-dependent condition."
17401,"Everyone will restrict travel to places with COVID out of control, even after vaccine roll-out."
17402,No one wants to risk a vaccine-resistant mutation.
17403,But all of that is nonsubstantial-- I think the thing I've been focused on in this discussion is how someone can define anything as a win other than preventing death and suffering.
17404,*Maybe* impact on unemployment and median income as 2nd/3rd considerations?
17405,"Again, not amazing in the US relative to AU."
17406,"For what its worth, the USA isn't the worst in per-capita deaths-- we're about 8th worst there (1,313 per million)."
17407,Australia is at 36 per million.
17408,"We might have all adults vaccinated by July, they might by October."
17409,Is the higher death/disability really worth the ~4 months head start on full vaccination?
17410,What the hell is the point of winning on vaccination if we lose on death and economic impact on the majority of citizens.
17411,"We can leave it here, I just need to voice how totally arbitrary and callous it is to contest Australia's superiority over the US in their COVID response"
17412,"At least in Melbourne, they *were* literally barricading people inside their homes."
17413,The Victorian State Ombudsman [found it](https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/dec/17/melbourne-public-housing-covid-lockdown-violated-human-rights-victorias-ombudsman-finds) to be a human rights violation.
17414,"And that's just one item off the top of my head on the list of ""batshit crazy government overreach"" from our friends in Aus."
17415,"Some others:

\- A pregnant woman being arrested in her home over a FB post organizing a peaceful protest

\- Another pregnant woman being harassed for sitting on a park bench

\- Police talking about smashing car windows because people wouldn't answer their questions, as though this were totally normal and appropriate

\- General [police overreaction](https://www.hrw.org/news/2020/09/24/australia-harsh-police-response-during-covid-19)

\- SA going into a panic because one infected person lied about going to a pizza place

\- SA police telling people they can't go outside or even walk their dogs because OMG NEW STRAIN

Again, this is just off the top of my head."

17418,A month?
17419,"Shit, I live in Florida, and those 65+ y/o are phase one vaccinations."
17420,That makes up 25% of the state population before you include front-line healthcare providers and those at risk due to pre-existing conditions.
17421,"With the rate at which things are moving with phase one, my ass will be lucky to get a jab by the end of summer using an inferior J&amp;J vaccine."
17422,A month... phht
17423,This is the nature of the vaccine/virus arms race.
17424,"The 60% or so effectiveness the existing vaccines show vs the worst of the variants is good enough to slow it down, and then booster shots will be better designed for the new variants."
17425,"Booster vaccines will not require full three phase testing, probably just a short safety trial."
17426,Why don't they stick to enforcing the existing non discrimination laws first?
17427,It's pretty clear they don't actually care about them except in cases where they suit their bad faith arguments
17428,Yeah listened to a podcast that the true infection numbers are probably 4x what was actually recorded so roughly a 100 million
17429,That's not true.
17430,Good luck.

17455,"Granted, it is different because it's a health-related matter and there should be some allowance for employees having the freedom to choose, but like I said that kind of discretion should cut both ways in the middle of a pandemic."
17456,"We're all trying to get through this difficult time while being respectful of people's right to their health choices, but you can't just say ""meh, whatever"" if people make a choice that puts other people at greater health risk."
17457,I'm trying to strike a balance.
17458,Yes I’m sure the lockdowns they’ve been sporadically doing on and off since last March are why the virus has had a nuclear collapse over specifically the last 3 weeks
17459,It's strange how conspiracy theorists have gotten so common that you now get people who try to block a vaccination site due to them believing in looney toons facebook delusions .

17476,"Maybe, obviously am not a doctor, but considering how many fat kids there are and how few children have died from covid I just have a feeling that there must be some other underlying issue that caused it."
17477,"For example, heart disease runs in my husband’s family and his brother died from a heart attack at age 18, he was a bit overweight, but it was his underlying heart issues that caused his death not his weight."
17478,Are you sure that’s right?
17479,Last time I checked it was 133.
17480,**under 19**.
17481,So 133 in like 1/5 of population?
17482,Could this not be equally due to the fact we are a year into the pandemic and it possibly made its way through the population.
17483,WE LIKE THIS SHOT💉
17484,But I thought kids weren't affected by COVID at all?
17485,That's why we could open schools?
17486,They just were immune from the beginning.
17487,"(/s because that seems to be needed here)

There is a big difference between all those deaths you quoted (would like to see your source btw) because each and every one of them are direct cause/effect and are isolated incidents."
17488,This is a pandemic.
17489,One person's actions (or inactions) can cause a hundred additional cases.
17490,One car crash won't lead to someone else dying ten miles away a couple weeks later.
17491,"Schools previously wouldn't let kids in school because their MMR, DTAP, Polio, or Meningitis vaccines weren't current."
17492,"And those deaths that those vaccines prevent were in total, what, in the hundreds combined annually for kids?"
17493,But they'll let kids in school for a highly contagious disease sweeping the world without proper vaccination.
17494,"So yeah, let's keep things in perspective."
17495,Thats all you got?
17496,Weaponized conspiracy theories.
17497,"Groups have used facebook and other things to wind people up, egging on any fear."
17498,certain people when in elected position in this country have validated their fears.

17556,My mom works for a congregate setting that received vaccine over a month ago.
17557,They distributed vaccine to anyone who wanted it the first week and have been trying to convince others to get it since.
17558,"They offered it to WFH employees and if those people didnt get it, they'd continue to sit while they try to convince the patient facing people to take it"
17559,This may be a no brainer question for some but what even is the point of having a PM if the state Premiers can willy nilly make their own decisions without his authorization or approval?
17560,"I may be misinformed but from an outsider's POV, it always seems like he vocally isn't in favour of the decisions the Premiers make."

So moving on from passe projections of vaccine nationalism', Let's talk about the wider picture for a second beyond Brussels;  the distribution of vaccines managed by the World Health Organization (WHO); Gavi, the Vaccines Alliance; and the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI), is meant to solve so-called vaccine nationalism, 

Uk started funding this early: 

https://www.forbes.com/sites/oliverwilliams1/2020/03/27/uk-makes-worlds-largest-donation-to-find-a-coronavirus-vaccine/?sh=5766068a5d86

17697,"Source: https://ec.europa.eu/international-partnerships/news/team-europe-contributes-eu500-million-covax-initiative-provide-one-billion-covid-19-vaccine_el

In fact the largest donor is United Kingdom, eclipsing EU 

I invite you to click the tab 'Vaccines and COVAX"" AMC donors as of 18 December 2020

https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Access_to_COVID-19_Tools_Accelerator

Notably of the €500 million provided by the EU, the lion's share — €400 million — is a loan from the European Investment Bank (that in part supports now non existent vaccines like Sanofi) and not a direct contribution (something in common with the EU own 'funding' for vaccine development

Again, I'll let this above link speak for itself, as can the following."
17698,"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/GAVI

&gt; In the period of 2016–2020, the UK was Gavi's largest donor in the 2016–2020, 

without the US, UK would be largest state donor to WHO as well, as well as being the first and one of historical largest donors to IMF pandemic relief CRRT above EU 

The facts are AZ vaccine is the most widely distributed vaccine in the world, more than  1B doses are being produced and distributed around the globe **with the goal of no profit, or in many cases no cost**,  it's licensed out freely in technology transfer agreements, somewhat akin to open source software and able to be made in local places across the global 

 there are 150M+ ready to be distributed in Q1 alone via covax."
17699,"These agreements were funded predominantly from UK with co-operation of India's SII and charitable organizations with the express goal of co-operation and international vaccination 

Meanwhile pfizer/Biontech has only of several days ago, more than 8 months after AZ finally agreed to donate ""up to"" 40 million doses to covax."

&gt; European Union Institutions (EUI; including the European Union or EU and the European Investment Bank or EIB) are the fifth-largest donor globally, with total official development assistance (ODA) at US$14.8 billion

&gt; The United Kingdom (UK) is the third-largest donor country in absolute terms, spending US$19.4 billion (current prices) on official development assistance (ODA) in 2019 according to preliminary data from the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD)."
17702,"I have some more data on funding specifically of EU vaccines to address your quetion  but can't be shared due to terms of PDF, it's a paid for analytics service  therefore think it would be easier, -- as someone that seems informed enough to take such strong stances on this topic--   if YOU link me your public data sources on what you feel represent the total EU funding."

17976,The only real way it would work is if children were vaccinated too.
17977,Otherwise what do you think is going to happen when you throw thousands of children back into one building?
17978,Children are by far the most dangerous because they can contract and spread Covid without displaying a single symptom.
17979,Throwing kids back into a school creates the risk of a new variant being made that puts us all at risk of starting this entire process over again.

18085,"come on, you know better"
18086,It’s cringe to not critically think
18087,Except the northeast is from the beginning of the pandemic (and the highest population density) when we didn't have the better medical response and treatments we have now to deal with COVID and minimize lethal outcomes.
18088,"Mississippi and South Dakota, especially the latter, have no excuse."
18089,Where did I say you did?
18090,I'm just pointing out your inaccurate statement.
18091,What should have been done is irrelevant unless you have a Tardis.
18092,What should be done now is all that matters.
18093,Some were recommended for release years ago.
18094,Some should be tried for whatever crimes appropriate in an actual federal court.
18095,But just being held until death with at best a military tribunal judging them is profoundly amoral and un American in my view.
18096,"No I’m not giving up LOL, don’t ever rest that tone on me I’ve been thru far more than you, I’m assessing my risk and when deaths drop this spring I’m done social distancing."
18097,Listen to Fauci all you want but he doesn’t set the restrictions and most states base hospitalizations.
18098,"Most experts have this summer as normal except Fauci who has explicitly said he gives conservative estimates and predicted end of summer

Just give it up"
18099,"I agree, but hospitalizations are down 25% too, which is awesome

1"
18100,"Damn thats pretty fucking good, I remember when a lot of people (myself included) thought that if/when Covid got to India it would be a mass catastrophe, great to be proven wrong!"
18101,I've asked this many times on here.
18102,It's funny how in the past few months the tune here has changed
18103,Oh yeah I single-handedly killed 400k people /s
18104,He has a track record of being way too pessimistic.
18105,Didn't he claim that the US needed 500 million vaccines for Ebola?
18106,No I got the joke.
18107,Just pointing out the absurdity of things we’ve been told throughout all of this
18108,Should keep going
18109,"Well, to begin with, china can not be considered a thrustworthy partner."
18110,The real hot take is that anywhere outside of the M25 is the North.
18111,These are nice numbers.
18112,Keep vaccinating brits.
18113,Pfizer is 3 weeks.
18114,Moderna is 4 weeks.
18115,Lmao can't believe its cringe now to warn people about the consequences of their actions.
18116,You wanna go out maskless and ignore social distancing?
18117,See where that gets you.
18118,"European commission fucked themselves, blame them."
18119,Hospitalizations are starting to drop by 2-300 a day in NY.
18120,Pretty crazy.
18121,And we have our lowest positive percentage in a long time.
18122,Maybe we can mix it into some applesauce.
18123,"Works for little kids, might work for the grownups who act like little kids too."
18124,that's crazy you support your government doing that
18125,Vaccayn Corooney NICE STRIKE
18126,It’s not clear.
18127,He is coming from that eco-chamber called r/india.
18128,Leave him.. his brain doesn’t allow him to think more than this.
18129,He might get anxiety attack if he has to think more than his caliber.
18130,These people from r/india can never appreciate anything this government does.
18131,"If the GOI would have decided not to give away vaccines, these people would have commented: “See Modi doesn’t even know to maintain relations with outside world, he has too much of ego."
18132,Modi’s foreign relations means only taking flights and meeting them.
18133,This would have been the golden chance to maintain the relationship with other countries if we had decided to provide vaccination to other countries.”
18134,"""Goalpost shifting"" would be saying not even until the end of this year."
18135,The summer is optimistic and the projected is late summer/early fall.

18152,The whole thing is a popularity contest.
18153,BLM and Trump have also been nominated.
18154,"Although to be fair, Trump was the only US president in 40 years to avoid getting involved in a new war, so he's a pacifist in relative terms."
18155,This was debunked weeks ago when it was first published.
18156,Why bring it up again now?

18165,I can’t really take it anymore.
18166,It’s so hard to follow the rules and care because my sacrifice is basically useless to me.
18167,If next fall semester isn’t normal I’m probably gonna drop out again.
18168,I’m really sick of caring about everyone and no one cares about me.
18169,Not everyone is living comfortably right now.

18183,You can't let yourself get triggered.
18184,"Yes, which is why Pfizer is sticking to the 21-28 window in public statements."

18188,Just stop.
18189,Past this spring deaths are going to be non existent especially considering the pace for herd immunity were on and I’m not going to listen to your goalpost shifting for even half a second.
18190,"Give it up

And my grandma got hospitalized w covid and now has the sweet sweet antibodies so don’t worry about what I’m doing"
18191,Yes but it's not a lockdown.
18192,"The term is now used quite universally, but what you describe are social distancing measures."
18193,glad that sub seems pretty dead as of rn
18194,"The first dose offers a lot of protection, I read in one article over 80%."
18195,So the thinking is it’s better to double the number of people vaccinated to 80% efficacy than to get everyone a second dose.
18196,As some one in group 4 for vaccinations i appreciate this.
18197,It’ll come to me quicker and I can stop feeling panicked the entire time.

18205,"No airborne transmission, don't wear masks, do wear masks, this distance, that distance, 14 day quarantine, 10 days, 7 days, don't open schools, open them, etc."
18206,They are overly manipulated by politics and completely failed at containing the virus.
18207,Pick any other source please.
18208,"Let's see, there are 535 members of Congress."
18209,"If the Pfizer/Moderna vaccines remain 95% effective at scale, then 26-27 members of Congress would still be at risk of catching COVID."
18210,"So one member catching COVID after both vaccines is, really, a non-story here."
18211,"Italy in the spring you could go grocery shopping, but you couldn't technically go for a walk."
18212,"I think you could also get take-away, but that I am not 100% sure about."
18213,Good luck to living with the guilt that you may kill someone's grandma.
18214,"Or your own

Stick it out until the summer and then we can talk about relaxing regulations."
18215,"If we lighten up now, we'll just kill and permanently disable more people"
18216,To be fair my Mrs had her first dose in December and is booked in for her 2nd dose in 3rd week of February - so 8 weeks.
18217,12 weeks looks like it’s a max.
18218,NHS doing a bloody amazing job.
18219,The UK could vaccinate Ireland in a literal week
18220,"Another thing was when r/Covidiots got angry at Jack Harlow for this lyric : “Gonna globetrot when they know a vaccine”, like he is being responsible about COVID and cares about his fans’ health unlike some other rappers and you still get angry."
18221,What happened was that they took the lyric literally and shamed him for “going on a global tour after the vaccine will be discovered and that he is not waiting for people to be vaccinated” and forgot that he implied that he will be waiting until it is safe for concerts.
18222,Correct - although 1 in 10 makes it a bit more potentially personal than using the large numbers.
18223,Easier to visualise.
18224,I agree with your point.
18225,I really do.
18226,I guess my point is if I was immune compromised and I had the opportunity to go get a shot.
18227,Even if it was states away.
18228,"I would go, because no one did anything to help society as a whole when they could and the bar was so fucking low."

18235,We can also get anti-vitals.
18236,It’s not just vaccines.
18237,We need treatments and those should not be as impacted by mutations.
18238,Come down off your high horse and Look at the list of states that have been hit hardest from the linked article: South Dakota.
18239,"New Jersey, New York, Massachusetts, Rhode Island, Mississippi."
18240,Pretty decent spread across liberal/conservative and urban/rural areas.
18241,This isn’t political and doesn’t have anything to do with “certain parts of the country” - the virus doesn’t care what people think about it.
18242,"Your qualifications (second dose for BionTech and delivery schedule for AZ) would be subject to fierce negotiations, I assume."
18243,"Just a hypothetical scenario: AZ-UK contract stipulates the delivery of 20M doses in Q1, factories can make 30M."
18244,"Then, according to the pov of the EU, AZ should deliver 10M doses to the EU."
18245,"*When* this should happen (after the UK orders or in parallel), is difficult to assess, as people on both sides are literally dying."
18246,"Similarly, assume the UK is to receive 20M doses of BionTech, got 18M and applied them as first dose."
18247,"Germany got 10M doses applied 5 as first dose, keeping the rest in storage.Now the production drops massively for a few weeks."
18248,BionTech can produce 15M doses.
18249,Should that all go to the UK because of the second dose factor?
18250,"I don't think so, but it's not a completely ridiculous argument, either."
18251,I should edit to say good news everyone!
18252,Lol
18253,Only if the protestors have dark skin

18255,Trudeau is a con artist when it comes to crap like this.

18265,"And if a different vector is required, isn't that what Astra Zeneca and Sputnik do (albeit somewhat poorly)?"
18266,Finished is a stretch.
18267,There’s countries that haven’t even started vaccinating.
18268,This is right.

18274,Pretty disappointing honestly.
18275,"But it makes me wonder, where are the extra doses coming from?"
18276,"\^ this ... when I think of ""lockdown"" I think of what Italy had in the spring where virtually everything was closed or in Wuhan where the paramilitary People's Armed Police went around welding people into their apartments."

18289,He's already lost support from restaurant owners who are anti-lockdown...now he's choosing to lose support from those who wanted a Governor with the guts to make the difficult decisions and beat COVID.
18290,Can't wait to vote against Newsom and his oil-lobbyist family.
18291,I wouldn’t say he’s credible.
18292,Every week he claims some doom is right around the corner than never comes.

18295,.. What?
18296,"Look I hate to sound callous, but in 10 years almost no one will remotely care about COVID deaths per capita anymore."
18297,"People will care about having Pfizer or Moderna though, as their drugs will vastly improve healthcare around the world."
18298,But COVID deaths?
18299,It's going to be forgotten just like the deaths of the 1918 pandemic.
18300,Australia and New Zealand will keep boasting about their pandemic response but others will just shrug and ignore them.
18301,Can these people fuck off
18302,"Are they seriously going to try to keep up restrictions in the US for years due to people in Africa, South America, etc."
18303,not being vaccinated yet?
18304,Because that is completely insane.
18305,"In Ohio, just over 3k cases reported today."
18306,"I know Sunday cases are usually lower, but our Friday-Saturday cases were a little over 4K."
18307,"Long from over, I have no illusions about this being the end of the road yet, but it is extremely heartening to see these lower case numbers."
18308,"I’m very hopeful this is a trend, rather than an anomalous drop."
18309,Wow.
18310,A whole one case.
18311,What’s that bot that condenses articles and posts them as a comment?
18312,"We need that here, headlines alone are often misleading and people don’t tend to read the articles, especially if they’re paywalled or subscription based."
18313,"The vaccine hadn’t had time to take full effect for either of them (one had only 1 dose) and they’re both asymptomatic, which is what the vaccine was approved to help achieve."
18314,This isn’t cause for alarm.
18315,This thread isn't too far from being like that either.
18316,The other day there was a comment about how awful masks are.
18317,A couple people replied that they didn't mind masks and were down voted for it.
18318,I'm somewhere in between my local sub's (SF) and this sub's views on covid.
18319,Jaat?
18320,"I said kaun jaat ho, were you born yesterday?"
18321,Oh little child just discovered the internet
18322,How long were already talking two years.
18323,It would be quite detrimental to most people’s mental and physical health to isolate for years on in.
18324,The flu can have long term effects too.
18325,If you want to isolate go ahead but for most people it’s A.
18326,Economically impossible and B.
18327,Not worth the isolation from friends and family.
18328,and thank you for making my point lol.
18329,why?
18330,I get yelled down every time I say that.
18331,It is ramping up and obviously without considering per capita it's the fastest or one of the fastest.
18332,Why complain on everything?
18333,Don’t need to.
18334,That’s simply not how it works.
18335,"It’s common sense, it doesn’t need a study to verify that they’ll be effective - it’s the same ones that showed it was effective in the first place."
18336,"Less effective I’ll give you, but that’s not the same thing as 0%."
18337,"Not replying further, don’t need to talk to those that are just seeking to turn it into politics."
18338,I think everyone is struggling with the same issues - has a single one of the vaccine companies hit a supply target so far?
18339,I get they’re being as aggressive as possible but I really feel under-promise and over-deliver would have been a better strategy.
18340,Did you just not agree with me or directly started name-calling?
18341,"Italian, Muslim, jaat."
18342,Wow!
18343,so much for disagreement.
18344,haha
18345,Looks like the UK Variant in the US is most prevalent in the Miami area according to Face the Nation this morning.
18346,Could this be because the governor of Florida has basically banned mask mandates and refused to shut down high risk non essential activities?
18347,It sounds like this is a huge risk that affects way more than just Florida.
18348,"If they’re vaccinating people while letting community spread run rampant at the same time, could that increase the risk of creating a vaccine-escaping mutation?"
18349,"Also, not everyone wants it, or wants it first, and that's slowing everything down."
18350,"Where I work nurses got first appointments, but they quickly opened it up to all job types."
18351,"However, after 6 weeks, less than half of employees are vaccinated and appointments still aren't maxed out."
18352,People are just dragging their feet for some reason.
18353,"So the job based tiered rollout was good intentioned, but it just doesn't work."
18354,Teenagers tend to be immature about silly things like bringing a pencil to class or doing classwork.
18355,"When it comes to serious matters, I've found that within the decade of my teaching experience teenagers tend to be much better about following the rules (fire alarm pulled, lockdown, etc.)"
18356,Then most adults.
18357,"And yes I'm well aware of the study being completely biased, such as them targeting an upper class rural area with self reporting."
18358,You’re forgetting that at a certain age there is a greater than 10% chance of death every year no matter what.
18359,Taking risks makes more sense.
18360,You’re also forgetting that there is no guarantee of giving your relative COVID in the first place.
18361,My relative (who I didn’t see) died within a week after the Christmas that I didn’t see him.
18362,I regret missing it hugely.
18363,They’re in lock down again lmaoo look it up
18364,Ok.
18365,Please cite the study that shows it.
18366,Which is why any portion of the world without cold storage will be using the Johnson and Johnson vaccine.
18367,Not a chance.
18368,Not everywhere even uses the cards.
18369,The place my dad is getting it from uses printed forms.
18370,They said the cards took too much time to fill out by hand so they're doing their own way.
18371,That is news I am looking forward to.
18372,&gt;  Surgeons wear gloves and masks.
18373,Doctors fought hard against sanitary measures in their profession.
18374,See Semmelweis.
18375,I appreciate the thought out response and agree with most of what you said.
18376,However I’m still not afraid of covid and I’m still not getting it if I can’t return to normal.
18377,You can't go by those numbers on bloomberg.
18378,NY runs out of first doses every week now.
18379,But bloomberg never gets anywhere near 100% for them.
18380,They must be counting second doses or something.
18381,Dozens.
18382,I guess most want the schools closed.
18383,At this point it does not matter where the doses from a particular plant is going to.
18384,Pfizer is doing the best of all the producers to make as many vaccines as possible.
18385,"2 billion in 2021 they aim to make, which mean they should be able to deliver to all their customers in time as the total orders are currently at ~ 1.2 billion."
18386,https://www.europeworldnews.com/blockchain-may-have-arrived-too-early-but-its-done-now/
18387,Assuming someone got paid just because they dont agree with you.
18388,Classic delusional namazi.
18389,I got paid the same amount every voter got paid when nda won with landslide majority.
18390,&gt;They were literally going to breach the Good Friday Agreement by allowing the export of vaccines from the Republic to NI to be blocked.
18391,No they were literally not.
18392,"The article 16 safeguards clause does not breach the GFA , it _could_ be used to breach it, but it does not follow automatically."
18393,In any event this was never the case here despite what a hysterical UK press and political class want you to believe.
18394,"No, let’s force everyone to get it."
18395,People aren’t smart enough to make these choices for themselves.
18396,Do not spread misinformation.
18397,"Realistically, it *probably* has an impact on how long you need to be quarantined."
18398,It just takes time before they can conclusively say that you can quarantine less.
18399,"Just like how people are still masking and all that after the vaccine, or even after having had the disease."
18400,Schools all over the country shut down during H1N1.
18401,"It’s virtually impossible to stop it spreading, even on a giant island in the middle of no where"
18402,"Possibly, but for those with immune issues taking a rushed mRNA vaccine is too risky and could also cause health issues"
18403,I considered it selfish for people to be primarily focused on getting back to normal when we were only 3 or 4 months into it.
18404,Now it seems silly to criticize people about that.
18405,"This is going to last for what, 15 months at a minimum?"
18406,That’s not an insignificant portion of a person’s life.
18407,It’s understandable that people are anxious and angry about the lockdowns now.
18408,"DAMNIT, don't jinx it!"
18409,Thats out of the 20K people in the study after a month I beleve!
18410,"That number wouldn't hold up when you start vaccinating millions, considering how many people still got 'severe' disease."
18411,Did they put immuocrompromised people in the trial?
18412,How about people 80+ who generally do get hospitalized from this.
18413,There are way too many questions left to answer before jumping for joy here.
18414,Can we please let vaccines be the end of this?
18415,Please?
18416,I want everyone to know that there is no reason for hesitancy after you’ve been vaccinated.
18417,None.
18418,"Once all of the vulnerable have been vaccinated, and they’re available to the general public, there’s NO EXCUSE FOR RESTRICTIONS NOT TO BE LIFTED."
18419,"Right now, for people who have their vaccines-do what you want but I want to encourage you to not wear your mask and to just do whatever the hell you want."
18420,We can’t have vaccines just be another goalpost set up for us to be moved.
18421,Do not spread misinformation.
18422,Did Israel finally admit that they will abide by the Fourth Geneva Convention?
18423,?
18424,"No, but don’t take that as a reason we should repeat this every year"

18436,Think they have a chance?
18437,Yes it is.

18452,"&gt; I just quickly googled this as I was unaware

And that’s all I’m trying to do."
18453,Make people aware and see a discussion about it unfold.
18454,All great points.
18455,My GF is a microbiologist and has mentioned much of this.
18456,"IMO, we would be well on the road to normalcy by the end of this year."
18457,These new obstacles will extend that timeline and people won't be happy.
18458,Wait for the frenzy when a double-masking mandate is made.
18459,A bit premature given that we don't know if the AZ vaccine is effective against the new strains and if so to what extent.
18460,JAI HO
18461,Remember that countries of the world song Yoko from Animaniacs was singing?
18462,Soon there'll be a variant from every country he said!
18463,/s
18464,"Ok genius, let me help you out; lots of hospitalizations are stroke, pneumonia, flu, heart failure etc."
18465,"If they also happen to have dead covid virus cells floating harmlessly in their system, they would test positive."
18466,This would inflate covid hospitalizations as well as covid deaths.
18467,Are you aware that the US only reported 35 flu cases in the 2nd week of December?
18468,"The five year rolling average is about 7,700 cases in that week."
18469,"If flu patients test (false) positive, that is a covid case, hospitalization, and death per CDC mamdates on counting deaths."
18470,"Also, if there weren't too many false positives with 47 amplification cycles, why then did the WHO just change that to 30 cycles?"
18471,"(30 is common with tests for infection with viruses, nobody uses over 40, because they know that causes a lot of false positives)."
18472,"Yes, at the end of the day this row over the vaccines between the EU and AZ is not going to change much."
18473,"We'll be 2-3 months behind the UK/US, which isn't that big a deal in the grand scheme of things."
18474,"Many poor countries haven't started yet, and many will have to wait until 2022 to get their first doses, which sucks for them."
18475,"Yup, you'd think they would rather pay for a man to have a quick outpatient procedure instead of a woman having an actual surgery."
18476,It's simple: stop reporting.
18477,India is a country where millions starve even as food gets exported.
18478,I feel like we need to convince people that there is a tangible benefit to getting the vaccine immediately.
18479,"We need to revise the messaging ASAP away from “even if you’ve had the vaccine, you still need to socially distance and wear masks for the foreseeable future” and towards “you should still take precautions in public and around high risk populations, but once vaccinated you can start resuming normal activities”."
18480,I’ve even had a hard time convincing my 67 year old MIL to sign up for the vaccine.
18481,Her biggest objections are: What if it has longterm effects we aren’t aware of?
18482,"And: “They say we can’t start having our bible study again even if we’re all vaccinated, so what’s the point in even getting it?”"
18483,Do not spread misinformation.
18484,So Europe says the end of the year when Fauci says the virus will die down in the fall.
18485,Let me remind you that the US is FAR worse than Europe in terms of spreading the virus.
18486,I'm seeing issues here.
18487,[removed]
18488,"&gt;317/600,000 is 0.0005283333 not being immune..."
18489,The vaccine isn't 100% effective... No vaccine is.
18490,"But something that's .05% not effective is very good

You have fundamentally misunderstood how effectiveness of vaccines is calculated."
18491,"600,000 people were vaccinated."
18492,They weren’t all exposed to the virus afterwards.
18493,"To see how effective the vaccine was, you need to compare that group to a group of unvaccinated people to see how many cases there would have been if there was no vaccine."
18494,"317/600,000 is great if your control group has 1500/600,000."
18495,"But it’s dog shit if the control group has 320/600,000."
18496,I watch a couple live streams from people in Texas who stream at drag tracks and car meets.
18497,Hardly anyone wearing mask at all.
18498,This is what I'm saying.
18499,I don't see the benefit of letting my immune system do the work vs taking this vaccine with these numbers (they are about the same at best).
18500,"Remember too, the way they get these numbers is by seeing how many people get sick."
18501,Whats to say that the 57% people in S Africa that didn't get sick with the vaccine didn't just happen to make contact with anyone with the vaccine.
18502,People are taking measures like mask wearing and social distancing now.
18503,This vaccine could totally be something like 20% effective.
18504,Reese's in pieces
18505,"Sorry, where are my manners?"
18506,Kaun jaat ho namazi?
18507,I know.
18508,It sucks.
18509,We need to get through this.
18510,"Same, I can't find any other news about it."
18511,Pfizer's vaccine requires comprehensive cold storage systems.
18512,Most countries do not have this capability
18513,Well if they were to implant a chip while administering the vaccine otherwise I'm sure they would use the same easily forged card like they use now and if you expect the goverment to use some sort of database to track who got it I wouldn't why else would they be using the card now.
18514,One more.
18515,Assuming my religion.
18516,Classic Arnab da
18517,X
18518,"Even if it was on the 18th, I understand 14 days are needed to have full effect."
18519,I hope that the vaccine can at least reduce the quarantine time.
18520,I will mask and distance like I should after the vaccine.
18521,I want to get back to life again.
18522,But will do so wisely.

18620,I was just trying to make a point that reaching those numbers before other nations is definitely a good position to be in.
18621,But we settling for that number is so disheartening and disappointing when we ourselves can reach much much higher than other countries.
18622,Canada should get from US/EU programs..India cannot afford to send vaccines to all developed countries.

18624,This is about South Africa and vaccines.
18625,If you read it.

18629,It's still going to be a tragedy for their family.
18630,"I hope you're right but we have seen a slew of stories, PSAs lately that masks will be required post-vaccine because 95% effectiveness is not 100%."

18655,"If states were consistently using &gt;95% of their doses, that would be true."
18656,"But right now only 61% of delivered doses have been administered, which means an additional 20million doses are sitting on shelves."

18658,I was with you until the second sentence of the final paragraph.
18659,"If they are pro-vax but anti-mask and anti-lockdown, they have a point."
18660,"Vaccines are something that we have known for decades (if not centuries) and are safe and effective with very little negative effects, but masks and lockdowns actually have negative effects and are new things."
18661,"Plus, there are no experiments that test whether masks are actually useful in an outdoor/uncontrolled enviornment (all mask experiments were done in a lab/controlled environment, which differs massively from outdoors) aside from the Danish study, which said that masks don’t protect the wearer (but it didn’t say anything on how much masks stop the spread)."
18662,Fuck anti-vaxxers tho.
18663,"Other than that, I fully agree."
18664,Having multiple scientific sources say there are is no proof either way should mean that its not safe not to just blindly assume that we are
18665,And no vaccine will ever reach everyone.
18666,"There are millions, maybe billions of people that have never been vaccinated and will never be."
18667,Even under the best possible circumstances we probably won't vaccinate more than 50-75% of the world.
18668,But the world has lots of viruses and new viruses emerge all the time.
18669,Addressing them and getting back to our lives has never required a 100% successful vaccine or treatment or unanimous global effort or anything like that.
18670,"It is just about reducing the impact and risk to something everyone can live with, or adopting to the risk."

18719,You're really pumping the hyperbole here and it's not helping your case.
18720,I'm not going to comment on your wrongness or rightness as i think that will engage a sunny day rhetoric about how 'you're' good.
18721,You aren't the world.
18722,3 out of 4 people in my house have had our first jab.
18723,"My Dad, mum and myself all work in healthcare in some form, my dad and I are both NHS."
18724,My brother isn't in healthcare so he'll be down the list.
18725,My 2nd jab is mid March just over 8 weeks from the first.
18726,There's no point in buying millions of doses if you rely on others to produce them.
18727,It's on Trudeau for not having foreseen this.
18728,UK is just doing a better job than the EU on this.
18729,Piers Morgan was calling this the greatest ad for Brexit.
18730,"It’s probably not because of Brexit that UK is doing well, but optically Brexit is looking good"
18731,"I'm sure that some people view school as childcare, so in a sense you aren't wrong."
18732,"However, it is much more nuanced than that."
18733,My daughter has a rare disorder and severe intellectual disability.
18734,The school system has done almost nothing for her in 11 months.
18735,She still is unable to communicate her wants and needs to us effectively even though she was making progress before last March with an AAC.
18736,My wife cannot work because trying to educate my daughter virtually requires that my wife act as a one-on-one aid 16 hours per week.
18737,Under IDEA the school system is required by law to provide Free Appropriate Public Education.
18738,There is nothing about the last 11 months that is appropriate.
18739,"Obviously, we aren't oblivious to the pandemic - which is why we have done everything we can to facilitate school for her."
18740,There is a growing body of evidence that school can be safe and that virus transmission in schools is generally lower than that of the broader community.
18741,"Further, her needs have been completely ignored by our local school board."
18742,"They stopped holding a public forum in March 2020 and have ignored our many e-mails, video messages, and even a story we had published in a local newspaper - they declined to comment."
18743,"Meanwhile, the president of the teacher's union get's face time with the board every meeting and the board has almost exclusively only discussed concerns of teachers."
18744,"Our teachers have had their first vaccination, getting priority over people with pre-existing conditions, and some over 65, and they still refuse to even go back to work in-person to only teach vulnerable populations of students: homeless, ESOL, disabled."
18745,"I am an administrator and have been required to be in-person since July 1 - not comparable to having 2-5 children in your classroom, but I do work in person with others every day."
18746,Our teachers would have to take 2-5 students per classroom and they won't do it.
18747,Kid's aren't learning.
18748,Many are facing mental health issues that are going unaddressed because the school psychologist isn't seeing them.
18749,CPS referrals are down 34% from the prior year.
18750,"Abusive parents aren't beating their children less, we just aren't seeing it and getting those kids help."
18751,"If teachers are going to skip the line and get a vaccine, they can go back to work."
18752,They just moved the goal posts to be that all adults and children need to be vaccinated before they will go back.
18753,[removed]
18754,Thanks this is interesting.
18755,It seems like these days you're either deathly afraid of Covid or a conspiracy theorist... there is no in-between.
18756,"I have wondered if hospitals or regions had an incentive to count higher covid deaths, maybe an unintentional or perverse incentive, like maybe hospitals get more funding or resources or staff if they have a higher count, something like that."
18757,"Also statistically the virus is really only dangerous to the elderly with health conditions, 80-90% of fatalities have occurred in this group."
18758,Why do you think this is not reported or known?
18759,Polls show that the average person thinks that their chance of getting the virus and dying from the virus are both 15-25%.
18760,For young and healthy people it's a tiny fraction of that and the same risk as so many other things.
18761,"Sorry you can't accept that your logic goes for every single country manufacturing vaccines like those in the EU, India, China, Russia, etc."
18762,Nobody has finished vaccinating their own entire population.
18763,Shit India is gifting vaccines to other countries.
18764,"Only the US has instituted this fuck everyone else policy, so yes you're just creating excuses."
18765,American exceptionalism at its finest.
18766,I’m not sure which is more shocking.
18767,That less than 10 people wore masks in this crowd or that of those 10 only 2 are wearing it properly.
18768,Imagine liking funerals so much you volunteered for a chance to have one.
18769,"For the military component of defending against a biological war, I hope so!"
18770,"For the civilian component, no."
18771,"The military doesn't build its own weapons, civilians do."
18772,"There are specializations in all kinds of ""wars."""
18773,"no point in continuing this, ur cringe tho"
18774,"no point in continuing this, ur cringe tho"
18775,I'm not defending them.
18776,I have said that I do not agree with them.
18777,"So many are misguided, believing in conspiracy theories."
18778,I'm just trying to provide maybe a little more insight into why they might believe their actions to be justifiable.
18779,I like the idea that we are keeping our stuff for us until we can reopen the economy.
18780,That's what is most important.
18781,Aye there are a couple of local pubs that are doing their normal menu burger via takeaway (just eat etc).
18782,Trying to have one every two weeks to help keep them open.
18783,I’m gonna sink that first pilsner in the beer garden in the summer like it’s nothing
18784,"No one is pointing the finger at any country, the problem is AZ breaching contract, that stated EU will receive orders from wherever and no contract will compromise it's contract."
18785,It says no where that Europe production will come strictly from Europe.
18786,"Insanity is saying few weeks before the delivery deadline that after all they will miss the delivery by more than 50 million vaccines, out of 80 million or 100 million."
18787,"I know, it seems like it's exactly the same interview as the one he did in La Repubblica."
18788,That interview and the released AZ-EU contract is basically what my whole comment was about in the background.
18789,[deleted]
18790,No idea.
18791,"You have, however, already been provided with a source saying that this was not the case."
18792,So many 5G chips for Bill Gates to activate /s
18793,r/britishsuccess
18794,Ball licker
18795,"&gt; The UK must hope the SA variant doesn’t or hasn’t already hit the ground much, as it appears the AZ vaccine is significantly less effective."
18796,Welllll then the AZ vaccine should go into the dumpster.
18797,A vaccine that doesn't protect against one strain is useless because that just makes the strain the dominant one.
18798,It's almost over
18799,"Come to Montreal, Ill meet you at the airport if you wanna try...."
18800,That’s why he gets the most attention.
18801,I believe the AZ vaccine has actually been proven to be more effective with the longer delay rather than the 3 week second dose.
18802,"Considering drag tracks and car meets are outside and 95% of people who attend them are under 30 it's probably not a good representation, IRRC not a single tx city has mask orders for outside gatherings only indoor ones"
18803,I hope so.
18804,My baby is due in Summer and would really love my friends and family to meet him or her.
18805,I’ve always been quite asocial but this pandemic has taught me to keep my loved ones (emotionally) close and appreciate them more.
18806,Also with regards to freedom you don’t know what you have until it’s gone.
18807,Thank you!
18808,Yeah there’s nothing heroic about making sure everybody else has their emergency oxygen on first.
18809,Imagine how many people you could help if you were conscious.
18810,I have two kids and I know I have to take of myself in some manner first or I’m no good to them.
18811,"There is selflessness and then there’s virtue signaling, which ironically is it’s own form of vanity."
18812,/r/nononoyes
18813,Ah that’s great to hear!!
18814,May I ask is your mum vulnerable too?
18815,My mum has asthma but not on the clinically extremely vulnerable list and has been shielding with my dad this whole time so she really wants it.
18816,Do you think she would be able to get it if she asked?
18817,Please don't try defend these idiots.
18818,They have absolutely no reasoning ability or have any conscience whatsoever.
18819,"Thanks, I've been looking for more info on that!"
18820,When did the coordinated state lockdowns start and end?
18821,"I'll try to take you slowly, maybe you'll understand."
18822,"Did Ian McCubbin, manufacturing lead for the UK vaccination task force, say that the initial supply actually comes from the Netherlands and Germany."
18823,Yes or no?
18824,It shouldn’t be any other way
18825,[removed]
18826,"Can't hoard when you don't have vaccines, EU master race"
18827,[removed]
18828,You know what?
18829,"That's fair

But theres still young people acting like they're invincible and nothing bad will happen to THEM."
18830,The point im trying to make is that their actions might kill someone else indirectly.
18831,"598,389 doses Jeremy?"
18832,That's _*insane*_
18833,Bingo!
18834,They aren’t excuses it’s the fucking truth.
18835,Sorry you can’t accept that.
18836,That's what we get for hacving Merkel and her buddies up there.
18837,Not to talk about Von der Leyen who so bad at everything she was promoted away to the EU commision.. Only to fuck germany again.
18838,"A “degree” of normality is already the majority of the states right now, and should be all of them within a couple months."
18839,What we should see this summer at this rate is normality with some minor restrictions here and there.
18840,Fingers crossed.
18841,"Probably not that easy, they are already there you can’t just move them to another part of the state with a snap of a finger"
18842,"Don't worry my dude, the vaccine roll out is slow, but there is enough 5G to go around for everyone!"
18843,"I had mine on Saturday (final year physio student) - it's great but my main concern is that the gov are still saying its 12 weeks until the 2nd jab, and there's zero evidence that it will be effective spaced that far apart (Pfizer only trialed them 3 weeks apart)."
18844,WHO and BMC are asking them to half it to 6 weeks but I don't know that they will because they want as many as possible to have 1 jab and some resistance to bring the numbers down.
18845,All well and good but could potentially mean these jabs might be a waste in the long term?
18846,And so they should.
18847,"Gotta admit, risking peace in northern Ireland was a bit of a strange hill to die on though."
18848,The disaster with Sanofi fucked everything up
18849,"&gt;I'll be at the end

Which doesn't feel that far away at all."
18850,Almost 12% of country vaccinated in 6 weeks with just 2 vaccines.
18851,Pfizer &amp; AZ ramping up again 2 weeks.
18852,Moderna arriving (already approved) in March and then Novavax and J&amp;J approved in March and arriving in numbers by April.
18853,Could see fit and healthy 20 year olds vaccinated at their local university with the J&amp;J supply by May-June time.
18854,Fridge temperature &amp; lowest effectiveness but also lowest side effects and only a single dose needed.
18855,"Unis have the infrastructure set up for testing every student twice for before and after Christmas travel, now they just need to be able to do this with a vaccination."
18856,"The end is literally so, so close!"
18857,"My vulnerable dad had his yesterday morning then they called my mum at 5pm and she got one too, 15 minutes later."
18858,Well pleased.
18859,"Hebrew articles say he feels fine, mild or no symptoms."
18860,Notice how the narrative changed once the vaccines came out.
18861,"The media thrives on fear mongering, instead of the pandemic going on forever now it is the scary new variants as if we havent had 12k variants during this entire pandemic."
18862,I’ll hang with my grandma when she’s vaccinated or otherwise we’ll hang outdoors with masks on.
18863,Where are these massive droves of grandmas and elderly people just swarming every business?
18864,I live near two senior apartments and barely see elderly folks out during regular times.
18865,I’m following the regulations but we need balance
18866,It’s unbelievable isn’t it.
18867,They’re just as bad as the antimaskers at this point.
18868,It’s ridiculous and my patience for it has run extremely thin.
18869,They live in a fantasy world.
18870,"When you delay ordering vaccines until late november and then order hundreds of millions of the wrong vaccines (french, belgian) because the countries demand a piece of the cake, instead of the known to be working german one."
18871,YES IT IS THE EU'S FAULT.
18872,And?
18873,The EU is sending us vaccines AND they are nowhere close to the US in vaccines per capita (and neither is Canada) so fuck off with the excuses.
18874,The US is acting exactly like everyone expected but own up to it.
18875,Where do you get the nonstop lockdown nonsense from?
18876,They should feel consequences for failing the people.
18877,"They keep is waiting, they are killing our economy and people."
18878,[removed]
18879,Your links show absolutely no proof they just show speculation that it may not no proof.
18880,"Also went and got her hair done when salons were shut down after saying ""getting your roots done is not essential""--justifying it by saying ""I'm in the public eye""."
18881,Jeez your arm would ache after that.
18882,"We had one ""national"" lockdown in April, technically these were state lockdowns, they just all started at the same time."
18883,"After that, apart from Victoria and a bit of Sydney, no one else has had a lockdown longer than a few days."
18884,[removed]
18885,"Okay so, this is where the article is giving you the facts without telling the entire truth."
18886,"Every year 80 000 South Africans die from TB, and that's in a normal year with the health system running about as well as it can."
18887,"Over the last year though, there's been LESS TB tests as the government has had to prioritize testing for Covid, to my knowledge, the number was down 30%, but it could be more, it's not really far fetched to posit that a large portion of the excess deaths are people who arent being treated for TB for the simple fact that they don't even know they have it now."
18888,"That might be a result of Covid pressurizing the medical infrastructure, but it's impossible to create a 1:1 relations vis a vis Covid and excess deaths in a country like South Africa."
18889,"And that's before we take into account the rule of thumb that for every percent unemployment goes up, .01% of the population dies."
18890,In South Africa thst would be 56k excess deaths.
18891,"This is not to pop poo the threat of the SA variant, I work in SA health."
18892,I've lost 3 patients this week to Covid.
18893,But the story is so much more complicated than all these deaths are Covid cases.
18894,Just have to be wealthy enough to own a car to get a free one in my town!
18895,"Yes, it's malpractice, but Hogan only cares about money."
18896,He's a scumbag and a fraud.
18897,"After everyone else got it, sure."
18898,And all those that didn't.
18899,"Yes, China only kidnaps Uighurs and others."
18900,Police checkpoints and random inspection for the most part.
18901,"Also heavy fines, like upto $5k AUD iirc if caught"
18902,Good Bot
18903,"If you believe those numbers are real, except Vietnam PERHAPS, then you're either ignorant or a troll."
18904,Time to get healthy like those athletes who got it and developed myocarditis.
18905,From a post above... this case/person has visited a lot of locations...
18906,It sounds like worst case from the timing and people who may have been exposed.
18907,With the new strains it is probably better to be careful and act now.
18908,The 'lower' efficacy vaccines still prevent long Covid (AZ and JJ).
18909,They are 100% efficacious against serious disease.
18910,"People really need to understand this, you have a higher chance of getting the sniffles."
18911,"The virus will continue to mutate and continue to run through the population over and over again until the virus fades away and becomes less deadly, or our bodies adapt to it."
18912,Survival of the fittest.
18913,"I think this is what people mean when they say what's going on is, the new normal."
18914,Prove it.
18915,I just checked the New Zealand travel advisory website.
18916,An advice not to travel is not an exit ban.
18917,You’re the one who’s lying including the people upvoting you.
18918,[removed]
18919,"The people responsible for 400,000+ people losing their lives having to deal with the mess they created?"
18920,No I'm not kidding.
18921,"Yes, let's please compare sparsely populated islands with a country of 328 million people or with densely-populated Europe."
18922,We all know New Zealand and Australia have done well because every single Australian and New Zealander has told us about 5000 times about it.
18923,[deleted]
18924,Got no money for that until pay day.
18925,Spent it all on toilet paper.
18926,I've met healthcare providers who haven't wanted the vaccine.
18927,All if them because they were scared to take it.
18928,I wouldn't put it past people to use altruism to cover up their fear of the vaccine.
18929,There’s some real fucking irony here I think
18930,You can keep your marmite
18931,Neither did any successful country.
18932,I don't get why this is so downvoted.
18933,Only 72 hours for travellers who tested negative as they need to wait in the hotels before the tests results come back and then they still have to quarantine but can do so at home with “increased security” but it’s 14 days if a traveller tests positive
18934,[removed]
18935,The constant fear of catching the virus has been the only real downside.
18936,I am lucky to work from home.
18937,"But I I started playing guitar (after 15 years of not touching a guitar), I spent lots of time with my senior dog, I watch massive amounts of Star Trek, and I have eaten mostly healthy meals right here at home."
18938,[removed]
18939,1) How do you propose we do that when they have parents who have no interest in feeding them?
18940,2) How does that address the problems of them not receiving any education or having access to a safe environment?
18941,I don't think you realize how important schools are to impoverished youth.
18942,I got my second dose of Moderna yesterday!
18943,"Waited in line for 4.5 hours though, yikes."
18944,"My cat spring-launched off of the injection site in the middle of the night and I thought I was going to throw up, hurt so bad."
18945,And yet.
18946,A guy.
18947,Who works at a quarantine facility.
18948,Doesn't feel well and takes 2 days off.
18949,"In those 2 days while not feeling well, goes to a bunch of crowded places."
18950,Makes ya wonder how cautious this guy really was at work.
18951,That’s consistent with their projections.
18952,How do you know?
18953,Ok so if they don’t reach that 70% threshold they won’t let things fully open even if it takes years to reach 70%?
18954,How are they going to get the modified vaccines out fast enough to keep up with the speed of mutation?
18955,Will 70%+ of the population have their initial vaccines before the boosters are necessary?
18956,No indication of that.
18957,I think you’d be surprised.
18958,"Pre-pandemic, in my experience, the anti-vaccine folks were split evenly between far right and far left."
18959,My first hardcore experience as a parent with anti-vax folks on the west coast was from very left leaning parents.
18960,"Today, I’m based in the Midwest and despite the politics of the pandemic, there are plenty of liberal individuals, including patients of the practices and hospitals that I work with, who are deferring or plan on completely skipping vaccination."
18961,everyone who died will recover because most of them didn't die
18962,Ok.
18963,Teacher here.
18964,My job can be done at home.
18965,"It’s actually much nicer, because those kids you’re so worried about learning are assholes and don’t work in person either."
18966,Difference?
18967,They don’t interrupt the whole class and make it easier for kids who want to work to actually do that.
18968,Lots of armchair educators.
18969,Also.
18970,Find schools evenly.
18971,And I’m not talking per pupil bullshit.
18972,I’m talking give the worst inner city school the same dough as it’s suburban counterpart.
18973,You pay your taxes.
18974,Want better education with it?
18975,Argue for it before and after the pandemic.
18976,Not during
18977,Does getting all republicans on record voting against coronavirus and economic relief hurt future elections for them?
18978,I would think so why do we need to work with you.
18979,USA tag?
18980,"Get your hands off Captain Tom, he's one of ours!"
18981,Next feature is permadeath.
18982,How can we be sure there weren't mutations like this before but scientists weren't looking for them?
18983,What experts are you referring to?
18984,"If we didn't listen to some of them, wouldn't have we ended up in a much worse situation?"
18985,I could easily be wrong.
18986,"They pack everybody into cramped favelas, in the dark."
18987,"Normally in the summer, people go out in the sun and spread out."
18988,"Viruses hate sun and open air, loves dark dank spaces."
18989,The virus thanks Brazil for the lockdown.
18990,Define “everyone else.”
18991,Literally no one is following any protocol.
18992,The pandemic is out of control in America.
18993,"If you are eligible for a vaccine somewhere and are high risk, I do not blame people for going."
18994,If other people did their part to help the immune compromised or high risk than I’d agree with you.
18995,"However the National mood seems to be fuck them, why should they live if I have to wear a mask."
18996,No I would compare this to the siege of Vienna by the Ottomans in 1683.
18997,The nobility got the f out leaving the city to hold out for four month.
18998,"Then they were relieved by allies from Poland which they doubted would arrive in time, if at all."
18999,"And then the largest cavalry charge (20,000) in history took place with the famous Winged Hussars routing the invaders 

The Winged Hussars have arrived at last but the Austrians are so overcome with despair they think even the relief force won’t save them"
19000,"We've had Christian churches all over the world (Particularly the US - but also South Korea), Assorted Muslim states (The numbers in Iran were particularly high early on because the leadership refused to close holy sites) and now we appear to have Jewish people flouting the rules both in Israel, but also in the UK (It was reported that 400 people had attended a wedding held at an Ultra Orthodox school)."

19013,"We can appreciate shaking someone's hand again, giving a friend a hug, going out to a restaurant with friends/family."

19033,Is there a video that isn't loading?
19034,"I'm not denying that it happened, it's just the article didn't discuss anything."
19035,"""Harassing"" is a loaded term."

19043,"I say try, because the government doesn't realize how unorganized the military is and a throwing bodies at the problem just means they'll be a lot of standing around and troops playing candy crush."

19064,It’s not that bad.
19065,I could probably last until October without any major issues.
19066,Just compare the number of cases in Europe during the summer and now.
19067,"Seems to me that there won't be herd immunity until most children, down to a quite young age, can be vaccinated and they haven't even started the clinical trials for those under 12, are are just enrolling the 12-16 trials."
19068,Whether normalcy can occur without kids being vaccinated is unknown.
19069,"It's probably just a fear tactic to try and encourage more people to get vaccinated ""if you don't all get it, none of us get to return to normal"" But at the end of the day govt's will cave into $$ demands, the need for tourism, etc by the time summer comes."
19070,Does that count the people dying from heart attacks and car accidents because the hospitals are at 100% capacity?
19071,"The ""compassion"" is a smoke screen."
19072,Stay in your hole then.
19073,We have the vaccines now.
19074,"Once I get vaccinated, studies prove that transmissibility is near 0, and I show no symptoms after 2 weeks I’m ripping off the mask with no reservations (unless I’m sick in the future)."

###**CDC Updates Contraindications to COVID-19 Vaccination**

— Casts wider net on allergic reactions to vaccine components

The CDC logo over a close up of a syringe drawing from a vial of COVID-19 vaccine
Anyone with a history of immediate allergic reaction of any severity to any component of mRNA COVID-19 vaccines or to polysorbate should not be vaccinated, the CDC said in updated interim guidance."
19188,"While previously the agency released guidelines for contraindication to vaccination, it's now broadened to include those with a history of immediate allergic reaction to a previous dose of or any component of mRNA COVID-19 vaccines, including polyethylene glycol."
19189,"In addition, people developing severe allergic reactions such as anaphylaxis after a first dose of mRNA COVID-19 vaccine should not receive a second dose."
19190,"All ingredients in the Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna vaccines were listed by CDC in an ""interim clinical considerations"" document posted on the agency's website (see Appendix B)."
19191,Polysorbate is not a vaccine ingredient but was included because people sensitive to it may also react to polyethylene glycol.
19192,"People with allergy histories involving these substances should be considered for allergist/immunologist referral to determine if they can receive the vaccine, the agency said in a call with clinicians."
19193,"""This guidance is being updated primarily because starting in a few days, people who got their first dose will be eligible to receive a second dose and we thought providers needed more guidance,"" said the CDC's Sarah Mbaeyi, MD, on the call."
19194,"""We are continuously reevaluating our guidelines to make sure they are based on the best available information, so providers had more information available when people started coming in for their second dose of vaccines."""
19195,"CDC guidance defined an ""immediate allergic reaction"" as any hypersensitivity-related signs or symptoms such as urticaria, angioedema, respiratory distress such as wheezing, or anaphylaxis that occur within four hours following exposure."
19196,"But it is important to distinguish allergic reactions from other symptoms, such as vasovagal symptoms or vaccine side effects."
19197,"Mbaeyi noted about 90% of people with anaphylaxis present with skin findings, ""which can be helpful in distinguishing allergic reactions from other reactions."""
19198,"She added that most immediate allergic reactions occur within 15-30 minutes of vaccination, whereas vaccine side effects, such as fever, chills or fatigue, occur a median of 1-3 days following vaccination."
19199,Those with immediate allergic reaction to any vaccine or injectable therapy not related to a COVID vaccine component or polysorbate requires a balance of the risks and benefits of vaccination.
19200,"Mbaeyi said in those cases, vaccination may be deferred and the individual may wish to consult with an allergist-immunologist."
19201,"Risks may include risk of exposure to SARS-CoV-2, risk of severe disease or death, an unknown risk of anaphylaxis and the ability of the patient to be vaccinated where appropriate medical care is immediately available for anaphylaxis."
19202,"However, as before, history of allergic reactions not related to vaccines, injectable therapies or components of mRNA vaccines -- such as food, pet dander, or latex -- is not a contraindication to vaccination, Mbaeyi said."
19203,"Those with a precaution to vaccination or history of anaphylaxis due to any cause should be observed for 30 minutes following vaccination, and all other persons should be observed for 15 minutes afterwards."
19204,"Tom Shimabukuro, MD, also of the CDC, said that cases of anaphylaxis following COVID-19 vaccination had received outsized media attention."
19205,"""These are still very rare events,"" he said."

19316,Your logic would dictate that the US prisoners and restrained migrants shouldn't be vaccinated either.
19317,"Only the people deemed fit to live in your book, I guess."
19318,How is it a risk?
19319,It’s mostly AZ vaccines and 8-12 weeks is the optimal time for the second dose.
19320,AZ CEO even said so publicly.
19321,"If adults and teachers are vaccinated in the fall, there’s no need to have anymore covid measures since that’s what people were most concerned about."
19322,Kids are at extremely low risk from covid so there isn’t much of a need for social distancing or remote learning
19323,I thinks its a bigger risk to leave half the people without any vaccination at all.
19324,If you had 2 grandparents and only 2 doses - what would you do?
19325,Sources
19326,"&gt; Distance learning is not remotely comparable to the real thing

I disagree."
19327,Now what?
19328,This argument is stupid.
19329,"This is what we’re really arguing:

You: “We are over-reacting to coronavirus.”

Me: “Our response to coronavirus is appropriate.”

This is a bigger debate than can be settled on reddit."
19330,Time will only tell how history will judge what’s going on.
19331,It’s pointless for us to continue arguing here.
19332,"Nothing I say is going to convince you to change your mind, and nothing you say is going to convince me either."
19333,My OPINION is history is going to look at the death toll and judge that we didn’t do nearly enough.
19334,They’re going to look at anti-science Q-Anon and Barrington nut jobs with ghastly disgust and wonder how we were so bat shit crazy back then.
19335,That’s what I believe.
19336,Only time will tell if I’m wrong or right.
19337,[deleted]
19338,Better ramp up vaccinations
19339,Same.
19340,One is literally the most selfless person I know.
19341,"Champions a bunch of different causes, spends tons of time volunteering, donates a large percentage of her income, politically involved."
19342,Just... really bad at risk assessment.
19343,*sigh*
19344,No one is spreading FUD.
19345,"Lol, I understand the pandemic but these things typically take much longer to be tested."
19346,"I'm talking about their being approved for emergency use, while we don't know what could happen long term."
19347,"That isn't FUD, there is literally no data to reference."
19348,So why don't you stop arguing with emotions and start arguing back with a logical argument.
19349,&gt;The mRNA vaccines are modern miracles that are like sniper rifles that train the immune system on the best protein to build antibodies against.
19350,Think if it as two months of navy Seal training.
19351,The JnJ vaccine is just a two week general army bootcamp that teaches your immune system how to shoot a gun at a general enemy.
19352,"This isn't science, there is no data, this is just some random individuals metaphor that doesn't even provide an explanation any more useful about the biological mechanisms or consequences at work than a 5th grade science book."
19353,My decision is my own.
19354,You can make your own decision.
19355,But don't pretend yours is motivated by some deep understanding of the issue.
19356,I raised a legitimate concern.
19357,"I didn't say I didn't trust *any* vaccine, I said I did not trust *this* vaccine."
19358,"Trust is earned, and not by lying to consumers for decades."
19359,"They don't deserve emergency authorization, they should give their production capacity to another company's more effective vaccine until they can improve the efficacy of their own."
19360,The US could be in a couple of weeks at the current projected growth.
19361,I expect we will all hit the finish line at the same time as manufacturing issues ease.
19362,"By this logic, do you support mask mandates then?"
19363,How could you know any of this?
19364,[removed]
19365,...Why would it be too early?
19366,?
19367,"I know people who've lost their taste back in March and still didn't recover, but I also know people who lost it and already have it back."
19368,Covid effects are very unpredictable...
19369,Cause it's necessary.
19370,You can't use Zoom for everything.
19371,"/S

It's ridiculous really."
19372,If you can't visit your dying relatives.
19373,Then what the fuck can be so important people have to travel?
19374,Everybody is struggling.
19375,Suck it up and do it right.
19376,Vaccinate teachers and staff and then open.
19377,"Welp, I had to reschedule my second Moderna shot for Thursday since we’re about to get blasted with a snowstorm here."
19378,Unfortunately I work that day and Friday and I’m not sure if I can get out of it.
19379,Should I be worried about the side effects knocking me down so that work is really tough?
19380,I had very mild side effects with the first shot.
19381,"... You said responsible for the majority of deaths, when normal people can’t even get the vaccine yet?"
19382,Did you even read what you posted?
19383,Then find actual science to support your opinions.
19384,Its out there.
19385,Its just less rant-y than this guy.
19386,"Imagine if the vaccine did this, and there's be no real way to detect it in such a short time period."
19387,Because kids are failing and not even getting 1/100th of the education they would be getting in in person school.
19388,"They are also missing out on social activities, sports, and extracurricular activities."
19389,Mental health is also a huge issue with students right now.
19390,But the teachers unions and school boards don’t care.
19391,All they care about is keeping everything closed so they can make full salary by doing the bare minimum and then blame the students when they get bad grades or have mental health problems.
19392,It’s been proven and confirmed by the CDC that schools are safe.
19393,"Also, telling people to “wait a little longer” is incredibly stupid."
19394,People have been telling us that for months and nothing ever changes.
19395,"Vaccines knock it out of the park, but to get a handle of the situation best we need to get as many people vaccinated in the shortest amount of time."
19396,"I agree that we should start opening up certain things earlier, so that people can have more fun in their life without going crazy."
19397,But expect masks to be a public requirement in core essential activities / transport until the critical mass of vaccine opportunity has been achieved.
19398,Isn't this the sort of thing that the cops should be dealing with?
19399,That'd be a much bigger benefit to society than shooting random black people.
19400,Do you not understand germ theory?
19401,We've known how this works for 130 years.
19402,"You don't get vaccinated, you spread the disease, you infect other people and they die."
19403,And I imagine you have the biggest of brains...
19404,"Not all *prevent* it entirely, of course."
19405,"But all have a significant effect on transmission, even those vaccines that don't provide sterilizing immunity."
19406,I hate how you have to subscribe to their shit just to read the article.
19407,I miss out on quite a few articles because I refuse to join the little club.
19408,&gt;	For a while only the newest iPhone could actually deliver the needed qr code.
19409,Source?
19410,Did you actually read the contract?
19411,"The contract states that the orders don't have to come from any specific place, they could even come from the moon for all EU cared."
19412,"AZ just has to deliver, nothing more, nothing else."
19413,That's what's in the contract.
19414,That's why legal action will be followed if they don't get their shit straight.
19415,Spanish flu likely mutated into something less deadly as H1N1 has never gone away.
19416,And that's one pandemic.
19417,"We never achieved herd immunity to smallpox, polio, or numerous other diseases until vaccines were created."
19418,The reduction in vaccine hesitancy as people have seen their coworkers and parents be just fine for the past six weeks is promising.
19419,Maybe by the time we're no longer having to prioritize people for access there won't be much of the fear-of-something-new (as opposed to standard anti-vax) hesitancy left.
19420,What went wrong?
19421,We actually put our faith in our government to not screw things up
19422,Blood on my hands?
19423,Wtf are you talking about... how can anti-vaxxers be one of the main causes of death when the vaccine isn’t even available to the wider population yet?
19424,"Sure, I’d agree pretty much all leadership has been incompetent considering it’s been “lock everyone up like they’re animals” or “let everyone free and discourage precautions”."
19425,[deleted]
19426,The article is about the UK
19427,The vaccines are extremely effective at preventing symptoms.
19428,"This means less viral load which means less shedding of virus particles, therefore they almost certainly reduce transmission."
19429,"And even if they don't reduce transmission, the fact that they are near absolutely effective in preventing hospitalisation still makes them worth it."
19430,That is great to hear.
19431,:)
19432,No idea why you think that.
19433,Our school has already announced it.
19434,"Hey, I heard Easter..."
19435,"So, what’s your solution then?"
19436,Wait until an African country passes around a mutation that breaks our antibody response and we go back into lockdown for another 9 months while we spool a new vaccine up?
19437,no.
19438,Enough of masks.
19439,"I tried to explain to my mom about why people are upset now about lockdowns, media, etc when they weren’t in the spring and summer."
19440,One of my main points was that the variants only got picked up in the news recently right when vaccines started.
19441,"If they get infected while in surgery, they'll probably still be at the hospital or at home recovering in bed, not out ""killing more people"""
19442,"Speed it up please, the mutations are not looking very favorable."
19443,And all those people should take the JNJ one rather than wait.
19444,It's objectively correct.
19445,It's more about her immunity than personal immunity to get things going again.
19446,&gt;New  data showing that two COVID-19 vaccines are far less effective in South  Africa than in other places they were tested have heightened fears that  the coronavirus is quickly finding ways to elude the world’s most  powerful tools to contain it.
19447,"&gt;  
&gt;The  U.S. company Novavax reported this week that although its vaccine was  nearly 90% effective in clinical trials conducted in Britain, the figure  fell to 49% in South Africa — and that nearly all the infections the  company analyzed in South Africa involved the B.1.351 variant that  emerged there late last year and has spread to the United States and at  least 30 other countries."
19448,"&gt;  
&gt;Johnson  &amp; Johnson announced Friday that its new shot was 72% effective  against preventing moderate or severe illness in the United States,  compared with 66% in Latin America and 57% in South Africa."
19449,"&gt;  
&gt;Laboratory  tests had suggested that the vaccines authorized in the U.S. — one from  Pfizer and BioNTech, the other from Moderna and the National Institutes  of Health — trigger a smaller immune response to the South Africa  variant."
19450,What...why?
19451,That speculation is not true.
19452,Schools will not still closed until kids are vaccinated.
19453,That is absurd.
19454,Are you that dense?
19455,They were upfront about how they weren't exporting.
19456,Canada made a deal with Pfizer's European lab to provide the vaccine.
19457,Pfizer is literally making the vaccine in Germany
19458,"We gotta get vaccinated ASAP, man....."
19459,I would suggest you research ACES.
19460,"They have actually shown the opposite, that trauma (and for less resourced families I’d call all this trauma) affects kids for the rest of their lives in a way adults aren’t."
19461,Yes the death of a parent would be a greater impact/trauma but most kids parents are under 60 so statistically that was never a likely scenario.
19462,People still murder even though we have laws against murder.
19463,I guess laws don't work.
19464,/s
19465,The old technology vaccines should be licensed widely to other production facilities.
19466,Man.
19467,I don’t know that was legal.
19468,I wish we would do that on a state by state basis and shut down all international travel.
19469,"We really need to get vaccinated, man."
19470,like NOW.
19471,That’s not the trend everywhere.

September 16 - my top local news station put out this article."
19479,Our local university has been doing sequencing and monitoring changes.
19480,This article mentions a mutation that looks like it might replicate easier and spread faster.
19481,This information received no such fanfare.
19482,It bothers me so deeply that only now have they started to beat the fear drum on mutations when vaccinations have rolled out to give people a bit of hope.
19483,The strict adherence to mask requirements is a bay area thing.
19484,I visit SF from time to time and everybody wears a mask no problem.
19485,"In areas like Sacramento, it's maybe 70/30 who wear a mask."
19486,"Also, the Sac sheriff publicly said he would not enforce mask/lockdown orders."
19487,OC famously ignored Newsom and fought back against lockdown orders.
19488,I saw absolutely packed restaurants in downtown San Diego in August.
19489,Where did the UK fund production capability for Pfizer ?
19490,In the US ?
19491,Because there is no plant in the UK.
19492,"Please give a source for that info, because I am calling bullshit."
19493,I think the UK is further along on roll out so should see it sooner than the US
19494,Wow.
19495,This is the first graph I’ve seen that clearly shows the immediate benefits of the vaccine.
19496,This is what Fauci needs to be talking about DAILY.
19497,"Will the vaccine eventually reduce COVID to an endemic, absolutely...it will just take a little time."
19498,Will the vaccines have a huge impact on hospitalizations and death almost immediately?
19499,Absolutely.
19500,Telling people vaccines won’t change anything until 85% of the population is vaccinated is the exact opposite of helpful if you want people to take the vaccine ASAP.
19501,"&gt;Someone below mentioned the fact that there is no evidence that being vaccinated means you can’t be a carrier,

This point has been atrociously handled."
19502,The vaccines are extremely effective at preventing symptoms and near totally effective at preventing hospitalisation.
19503,The mere fact that they prevent the virus from overwhelming your body to the point of becoming symptomatic should be a clear indicator that it reduces viral load and therefore also reduces the amount of virus you shed.
19504,"This means that less transmission is almost certain, even if it's not absolutely removed."
19505,HELL YEAH.
19506,I got my Moderna vaccine today because I'm a teacher and in Illinois's 1b group.
19507,"I went to a place that couldn't have been more efficient, thanks to the focused, organized, and polite National Guard troops staffing it."
19508,"My arm hurts, and I was tired enough to need a nap, but I feel good now and am ready for dose 2 next month!"
19509,So pumped.
19510,Time to lick doorknobs and have nothing happen!
19511,"(For some reason, my dad thought I was serious about this.)"
19512,Don’t listen to the neigh-sayers
19513,Unless borders stay closed to a limited number of countries.
19514,Double win for most in Europe.
19515,"If the first world is vaccinated, infections can still happen but there wouldn't be any epidemic risk anymore."
19516,You have to continually vaccinate every population on earth.
19517,That includes rural parts of Africa and Asia.
19518,Not going to happen.
19519,"According to the guy on r/Iowa that's been crunching all the numbers to keep track of our trajectory literally everything is dropping at a rate faster than he can explain 

So I think we're already seeing it"
19520,Other way around.
19521,Look up Amoy Gardens.
19522,One dude was ill and had diarrhea and incorrectly installed water traps caused hundreds to get infected.
19523,SARS issue was that it was *so* virulent that you could fairly easily identify sick patients by the number of ill people they left in their wake.
19524,Even 150 million is extremely underwhelming though.
19525,The US should get 200 million doses by the end of March.
19526,"And this includes just Moderna and Pfizer, so it will probably more with J&amp;J."
19527,I seriously doubt that's the issue.
19528,Completely different.
19529,Pre 9/11 they had private security hiring ppl from McDonalds to run X-ray machines.
19530,The TSA just professionalized it so of course it was going to stay at that level.
19531,With this at some point everyone will be vaccinated and the req will be unnecessary
19532,Youre getting down votes because you are right
19533,Thank fuck
19534,I'm in the US and the closest thing I saw was one city banned anyone that didn't live there from entering in early March.
19535,"The city is on an island with one way in and out, so they had a checkpoint to look at your ID and turned anyone away who wasn't a citizen."
19536,"Think the Florida Keys did the same thing, if you didn't live there you got turned back"
19537,Champing*
19538,yeah on that point fair enough.
19539,I think one good thing that will come out of this is the world will have much more vaccine production capacity so that next time we can have even more vaccine quicker.
19540,That makes sense.
19541,Good work mods.
19542,Lmao
19543,What do you mean “their companies”?
19544,Pfitzer was a US company last time I checked.
19545,"Bro, most people are satisfied with their *healthcare*."
19546,"Again, why does this bother you?"
19547,Moderna literally published their study and said it was 81% effective after the first dosage.
19548,Why are you refusing to believe actual facts?
19549,That's seriously exciting.
19550,Go humans.
19551,Totally agreed.
19552,Letting the states know how much vaccine they will be receiving was a start.
19553,Mass vaccine appointments were cancelled in my state because less vaccine was received than the state predicted.
19554,"They are now being told three weeks ahead, so at least states can accurately plan."

19556,Tried for what?
19557,Have you thought this through at all?

19559,Disgusting society we live in...
19560,&gt;US should hit 10 doses administered per 100 people tomorrow.
19561,huge milestone and more encouragement that roll-out is ramping up.
19562,"Well, this is just does per 100, not % of population."
19563,% of dose that are second shots will increase over time.
19564,"I don't think we can hit 25% of the population that fast, but crossing my fingers."
19565,Yep.
19566,But it’s ok keep working on it.
19567,My guess would be May.
19568,We really are kicking the shit out of this thing right now
19569,"Nothing more than me reading they were making a vaccine, a bear market, and more money than I ever could spend in the short term as readjustment allowance from Peace Corps."
19570,May we all have disposable funds.
19571,I just have a huge preference for whether that's at 45 due to some crazy lung scarring heart issues or at 80.
19572,"Willing to give up a few months to influence that 

But it's easier for me to say, because like I said, I wouldn't even have a good time if I went and did risky shit right now, my anxiety won't let me."
19573,So not much of a choice for me anyways
19574,I am so scared of the testing.
19575,I’ve managed to avoid it so far.
19576,"Because these factories require extremely finicky equipment that takes many months to produce, and must be staffed by experienced experts."
19577,"You can’t just build as many of them as you want, there are hard limits in the logistics chain"
19578,"Yes, thus my comment."
19579,This isn’t worth any more of my time.
19580,I think we are dealing with a language barrier.
19581,&gt;Recruitment into the study will complete in March 2021 and the trial will last for 12 months.

19585,"I’m really scared that the vaccination percentage is gonna be the next annoying quota to meet-it  doesn’t fucking matter if the vulnerable and paranoid are all vaccinated, let us go back to normal after that we can’t take any more of this shit."
19586,"If we’re at the point where vaccines are available to everyone who wants one, then if any restrictions continue that’s unacceptable."

19588,"Yep, by the time it’s ‘identified’ odds are it’s all over the place already."
19589,Heard somewhere they expect cases to go up in the US in March.
19590,Quite frankly I doubt 2021 will be end of it.
19591,All these plans are failing big time.
19592,Everyone wants to do their own thing so there’s 0 coordination in a global scale.

19596,"You’ll probably be able to travel pretty freely / safely if you’re vaccinated, traveling to places that are heavily vaccinated."
19597,If you are unvaccinated or traveling to countries that are not highly vaccinated there will likely be more restrictions.
19598,I imagine mandatory testing will remain a thing for traveling to/from certain countries .
19599,Also if there are case spikes in certain countries there could be rolling restrictions.
19600,Why vaccinated people are asked to still wear masks: they might not get sick but they can still spread it.
19601,It will come.

19606,What you are seeing is the natural course of a virus which is to propagate and evolve.
19607,"I also don't think viruses weaken over time (""peter out"") I think it's more of R0 falling because of human activity (""seasonal"")."
19608,If this theory was true than I would love HIV or the flu to become obscure.
19609,I hope I'm not wrong but to me it was easy to see that a lot of that conversation was broad generalizations.
19610,Also keep your chin up because with mRNA technology on our side we can quickly come up with booster shots to address variants;  I'm confident Moderna/Pfizer are already on it.

19615,It’s safe to say that there wasn’t an immediate effect on deaths and hospitalizations.

19642,I know there’s a period between getting your final shot and the vaccine becoming fully effective.
19643,I wonder if it was during this time that it was contracted.
19644,"I’m not subscribed, so I can’t read the article."
19645,Not to mention i imagine purchasing vaccines from other manufacturers this late probably won't help much in the short term.
19646,Seems best to just approve J&amp;J asap and focus on ramping up production of the currently approved vaccines
19647,It's that I know more than the CDC.
19648,It's that I have paid attention to what the CDC has said about every other virus.
19649,They spread in schools.
19650,A lot.
19651,Right now politics and economics seem to reign supreme and the CDC has been compromised.
19652,There is no logical reason that a virus with a *higher* R0 value (transmission rate) than influenza would somehow not spread in schools.
19653,It's completely absurd.
19654,"I use an N95 mask, nursing mask over it, and face shield over that."
19655,I do appreciate that link though.
19656,I should also add that I both teach and practice science for a living.
19657,So it's not that I am even remotely ignorant regarding the transmission of highly infectious disease.
19658,"I just understand the pressure the CDC is under to ""save the economy"" by telling people it's safe out there."

19666,No.
19667,"Gravity is blind, it just makes everything fall."
19668,"We've been able to push the limit of building height higher and higher, and there's no penalty for it - Small buildings don't fall over sympathetically or anything."
19669,&gt; I'm fear to think what else lies in wait.
19670,More animal-borne viruses for as long as people eat meat.
19671,More pollution-related problems for as long as hydrocarbon fuels are burned for energy.
19672,"Lead is still a problem in a few places, water supplies, aviation gas, etc."
19673,People still fight over religion.
19674,"It's not clear if imperialism really ended, racism and poverty and hunger sure didn't, and there will always be people who want to make democracies back into their own monarchies."
19675,What scares me most is that we can't coordinate very well.
19676,"The solutions to these problems are mostly knowable and feasible, but it's hard to keep everyone on the same page."
19677,"It seems like mind-viruses form almost instantly and spread online way faster than any biological virus, and then they form cysts that protect them from treatment."
19678,"I think the hardest problems we are facing now, and for the next 100 years or so, are not in the fields of physics, medicine, or chemistry, but psychology."
19679,How do we get people to unite _before_ millions die?
19680,_Before_ tens of millions of [QALYs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QALYs) are lost?
19681,But now there are anal swabs...
19682,no but they can deploy tear gas and pepper spray to those protesting for racial inequality!
19683,"That's because people interpret ""you should still wear a mask after being vaccinated"" as ""you will wear a mask forever""."
19684,It's honestly on them at that point if they can't understand the difference.
19685,We go back to normal when the rate of spread and severe illness declines.
19686,"That will happen as more people get vaccinated, but it's not instant."
19687,haha looks like someone burst already and you got a nut ;)
19688,But no president is willing to expend enough political capital to do anything.
19689,Those guys are going to be there until they die.
19690,It’s shameful.
19691,"Good luck, Commander."
19692,"Ah, I see!"
19693,That is what I'm assuming based on the community column.
19694,Would need someone with more knowledge of Israel and Hebrew to confirm that.
19695,That's not only a shitty move on such a short notice but also very concerning.
19696,"Afaik, the company said the production issues have been resolved and, for instance, Germany is on track next week."
19697,I also heard  nothing about shortfalls in the UK.
19698,Did Pfizer reallocate / shuffle the deliveries between customers?
19699,That would be deeply concerning.

19711,"Even after reaching herd immunity (low 80s%), covid isn't going to disappear forever."
19712,Nope
19713,People who have had the vaccine can still spread the virus?

19729,So that may be a slight problem.
19730,"But i mean with J&amp;J, pfizer, modenra and AZ i think combined that should mean a sizeable supply of vaccines by summer."
19731,Probably not enough for the entire population but it should cover atleast all the elderly/vulnerable and decent amount of the rest of the population.

19740,"Since the vaccines haven’t been studied and approved for the purposes of reducing transmission, the standard CDC guidelines on quarantine after exposure would apply."
19741,Basically we’re assuming transmission is unaffected by the vaccine for now to be on the safe side.
19742,"One thing I’m pretty glad about, now that I’m a few weeks away and really bunkering down before my 2nd shot, I’m really glad I never had to get a covid test."
19743,"Sounds super uncomfortable, I can’t handle things going up my nose like that."

19797,I would think that means the hospitalization rate should be much higher.
19798,"317/600,000 is 0.0005283333 not being immune..."
19799,The vaccine isn't 100% effective... No vaccine is.
19800,But something that's .05% not effective is very good... That means it's 99.95% effective... And on top of that 16 people got sick and 5 can die or did die?
19801,That's so tiny that I'm not calculating it out...

19818,"Mutations will appear as long as many people get infected, so we need a bit of luck as it will take years before the world are vaccinated, not to mention that 70-80% vaccination rate is needed for herd immunity."

19827,"Headlines act like we should be surprised, this is fearmongering"
19828,You are probably right in terms of statistics.
19829,The catch is that nobody knows nor **can** anybody know the exact time when a given point mutation in a virus has occurred.
19830,The 'probability' is that the mutation occurred before whatever segment of the population was vaccinated in whatever country.
19831,"This, however, is probability, not certainty."
19832,There is no way on God's green Earth that anyone can tell 'when' something as simple as a point mutation happened.
19833,You may be right that some or even all of these mutations occurred prior to the (recent and very spotty) vaccine provision.
19834,"No country, except perhaps Israel,  has achieved anywhere near the coverage where there is significant selective pressure from the direction of vaccine resistance."
19835,What is the situation where you 'can tell' the approximate time of a mutation ?
19836,That is what is done in genomic studies of bacteria and eukaryotes.
19837,"In such cases the researcher looks at whole genes, counts the number of point mutations and hazards a guess informed by the fact that different genes mutate at different rates."

19873,It’s estimated that one-third of Americans have actually been infected by this point since epidemiologists predict there are three undiagnosed cases for every one diagnosed case.
19874,With 26 MILLION cases that means epidemiologists predict &gt;100 million Americans to have had prior infections.

19995,"I’m thinking about vaccination, it’s easy to focus too much on your own personal risk."

UK doctors seek review of 12-week gap between vaccine doses

A major British doctors’ group says the U.K. government should “urgently review” its **decision to give people a second dose of the Pfizer-BioNTech coronavirus vaccine up to 12 weeks after the first**, rather than the shorter gap recommended by the manufacturer and the World Health Organization."

20260,https://www.express.co.uk/news/world/1387982/China-coronavirus-COVID-19-Beijing-lockdown-chilling-video-latest-news-vn.
20261,Do you really think China does things right?
20262,"You can cherry pick any two countries and say lockdown did/didn't work, just as I can do with florida and california."
20263,"I'm not saying florida's numbers are good, I'm saying that they are the same as places that had much stricter lockdowns."
20264,"Across the board, there are so many examples of places with strict lockdowns and high excess mortality (Peru, Italy, Belgium, UK)  and there are also places that had light or no restrictions (Sweden, Switzerland, Uruguay, Estonia) and had moderate or low excess mortality."
20265,"And I believe excess mortality is the best metric because it rules the influence bad testing, the way deaths are counted, co-morbidity, etc."
20266,https://ourworldindata.org/search?q=excess+mortality This is a good database.
20267,"Also, pandadata https://www.pandata.org/ has measured the relationship between lockdown stringency and excess mortality."
20268,"My views are rational thinking, looking at the actual benefit of what we are doing, versus the enormous cost."
20269,I don't consider one year to be a short period.
20270,"If we try to stop the spread for a couple months fine, but once its here it isn't going anywhere."
20271,Who says you are saving life with these measures?
20272,"Suicides, drug overdose, domestic abuse, diagnosed cancers, child abuse, depression, loneliness all have skyrocketed through this pandemic."
20273,And I know multiple people who have been affected by these issues.
20274,I know people that aren't getting cancer treatment because of this.
20275,I don't even know someone who knows someone who died from covid19.
20276,"And on top of that, we know that a very high percentage of people that die from Covid were very old or had underlying issues."
20277,I have loved ones that could have their compromised by this virus.
20278,But I also have loved ones that are seriously comprised by these measures.
20279,"The difference is we have no control over a virus, we have control over the measures though."
20280,Yeah i actually support Sweden's approach.
20281,"Made recommendations to the public, kept stores and schools opens, advised that masks don't offer protection."
20282,Meanwhile people were still visiting family and friends.
20283,"They took a balanced approach from the start, taking into account the well being of society as a whole."
20284,"Great achievement by Australia and the Australian government , but you will notice redditors  carry on like the government (which is conservative ) is the worst in the world."
20285,Everyone has their political preference but it is so one sided on this platform it’s ridiculous.
20286,Btw I hate trump and he should be in jail.
20287,My suspicion and I hope I am right is that people who already had the virus might get reinfected but it will mostly be pretty mild.
20288,of course there is a good possibility that is wrong... We should know more in the next couple of months.
20289,The Amazon variant will do exactly this everywhere.
20290,If the virus had chops it’d be licking them with excitement over how many people are letting down their guard after being vaccinated.
20291,Hundreds of millions have the mindset that the whole point of the vaccine is getting back to normal.
20292,"They’ll be gathering, maskless, with other vaccinated people."
20293,"They’re already braying about how they won’t shop at stores that requires masks, or they feel entitled to an exemption from masking, social distancing, and intense hand washing."
20294,They will be clamoring to go back to offices or just off of zoom period.
20295,The Amazon variant is waiting.
20296,The sheer biodiversity of the Amazon is its greatest weapon.
20297,We can expect a similar variant from the Congo.
20298,They will only get worse with each passing year with the sheer number of people getting infected.
20299,[removed]
20300,It is illegal to charge for the vaccine.
20301,"Providers can run insurance for it if insurance info is provided, but if someone doesn’t have insurance (or doesn’t give their info) then they still get the vaccine free."
20302,"And if insurance is used, the insurance company must cover the vaccine and isn’t allowed to charge the customer for it."
20303,My guess is as soon as the general public gets access to the vaccine.
20304,"As soon as you and some of your buddies and family get the vaccine, people will start letting their guards down."
20305,Bayer is a 55 billion dollar a year company.
20306,Its criminal Merkel didn't ask them to produce.
20307,We will have another surge; That's been accepted among experts since NERVTAG released data suggesting that B117 is up to 70% more infectious.
20308,"However, I am betting that the spring surge won't be as bad as Europe's (Ireland, England, Portugal) for several reasons."
20309,1.
20310,A sizeable percentage of our population has already become infected (~30%).
20311,This number is growing each day.
20312,"Right now, the evidence suggests that natural infection of the wild type should provide immunity against B117 (SA variant is a different story)."
20313,2.
20314,The number of people receiving vaccinations is increasing each day.
20315,"When B117 hit some countries in Europe, vaccination numbers were very low."
20316,"Unlike Europe, vaccines will play a pivotal role in controlling B117 here."
20317,3.
20318,A seasonal backstop will provide us with more cushion.
20319,"Despite these protections, a surge will happen, but I don't think it will be as bad as Europe's."
20320,I think that both things will be true.
20321,Those who have been vaccinated will reduce their compliance with any further restrictions and the vaccines will have a major impact on keeping people out of hospital.
20322,As the death rate drops and the hospitals empty there will be no justification for restrictions and Boris wants to ditch them as soon as he can anyway.
20323,A lot do.
20324,Just a vocal group makes Reddit think otherwise.
20325,"Thats ok, nobody is asking you (USA) not to reopen as you want."
20326,Could you take your comment into CoronavirusUS?

20329,Only issue is if supply can't keep up people don't get their second dose.
20330,that’s like asking a horse to watch a dog
20331,Multi fractured queries.
20332,Are sweden doing well with their vaccinations then?
20333,Things becoming more efficient is good.
20334,"The comment doesn't even say that lockdowns are a net positive or whatever, it just says that businesses have become more efficient, which is a good thing."
20335,"Why is it that, outside of this thread, this sub is obsessed with irrational fear-mongering, and inside this thread, people are obsessed with making the same ""vaccine good restrictions bad"" comments every day?"
20336,"I wasn’t drawing any conclusions, that’s what you are doing."
20337,You assume the politics and rule breaking etc means deflated numbers but disregard the default selection bias that occurs when people aren’t required to get tested.
20338,Saying the group that doesn’t elect to get tested has a higher positivity rate than the group that does choose to get tested is the questionable conclusion.
20339,All I did was provide an example where surveillance testing confirms the traditional expectation of selection bias.
20340,"It also takes months to retrofit production lines for a new type of vaccine too (this is the reason Pfizer and AstraZeneca are not meeting production targets right now, it took longer than they expected)."
20341,"Luckily, fewer months than building anew."
20342,My family decided to postpone Christmas to April-ish (or later depending).
20343,We saw no reason why we absolutely had to celebrate Christmas on December 25th.
20344,"The Northeast has some of the most densely populated cities in the US in a relatively small geographical area (comparative to the overall size of the US), and Pennsylvania in particular has age demographics and lower income living working against it."
20345,"Philadelphia, NYC, and parts of Jersey are all along the I95 corridor as well."
20346,We were always going to be one of the hardest hit sections.
20347,That seems to happen every single time theres am article.
20348,Do you have an article to share?
20349,I'm skeptical but interested in understanding why multiple mRNA vaccines simultaneously would be different than multiple vaccines of other types
20350,Lede.
20351,[removed]
20352,Because you are actively cheering for mediocrity at best.
20353,Because right now you are acting as a surrogate for everyone with any political power in this country looking at those survey results and coming to the conclusion that somehow because we value what we have we are clearly happy with it and nothing needs to change with what's happening here.
20354,"Because you are actively choosing to ignore how many Americans by the same pollster express fear of getting sick or injured because of the cost of treatment (not a reassuring point that we are truly happy with what we have if it's only satisfactory when we don't need medical care), when all but.. What was it, 4%... of Americans think the american health care system has problems?"
20355,Just ignoring that.
20356,But all is well because Americans with insurance think their plans are just OK.
20357,"It's just like the executives at those insurance companies, who probably can only live with themselves by telling their selves that clearly these idiot masses love how they fleece us and hang us out to dry."
20358,It's insulting.
20359,Like telling me I should take the abuse and thank my abuser for it.
20360,"After the mall protests, Garcetti claimed warnings were over, arrests would happen."
20361,"Yet day after day, unmasked protesters gather in mobs and aggressively endanger the lives of innocent people just going about their day."
20362,Why the fuck are arrests not happening?
20363,Where's the leak?
20364,Is it police refusing to follow orders?
20365,PD heads refusing to give and enforce orders?
20366,Somewhere else in the chain of command?
20367,It's so FUCKING SIMPLE.
20368,"I also don't understand why my friends who are healthcare ""allies"" like therapists - which is important work but can be done online for a few more months - are getting vaccinated ahead of grocery store employees?"
20369,"I appreciate my friends but tbh it sickens me that those in charge just continue to do nothing for the least appreciated, worst-paid, most-endangered people."
20370,"Yes, I want my vaccine, too."
20371,But I don't deserve it more than the person bagging my food.
20372,how do you explain california?
20373,You can if you time travel to the future.
20374,We need these data scientists to stop wasting time making predictive models and start working on time travel so we can get more accurate graphs.
20375,The issue is not administration its supply.
20376,Most states would take anywhere from 50–100 weeks to vaccinated all adults given current supply even if they administered 100 percent of the shots.
20377,The reason they’re at 50 percent is because they’re holding second shots because there is no evidence they’re going to get increased supply from the feds.
20378,NPCs have more sense than these idiots
20379,Temperature is a huge part of it though.
20380,In the Caribbean they've basically gone back to regular life for months now and there's been no real Covid spike.
20381,Yet in the UK we've been taking it so much more seriously (yes trust me) and it's more than 10 times worse.
20382,Does it just depend on the exponent?
20383,What constitutes over?
20384,Like I don’t think people should be in public indoor settings maskless until something like 60+ percent of population is vaccinated.
20385,With the exception of maybe restaurants and that’s because I don’t want restaurants to go under not because I really think it’s safe.
20386,[deleted]
20387,"or have security guards on rostered 'live in shifts"", so they don't go out and visit 30 places whilst infected."
20388,Then why the fuck are they being held prisoner for decades?
20389,Have you thought this through at all?
20390,[removed]
20391,I think the most likely outcome given vaccine producers meeting their deadlines and trial data being accurate is that by March we’re gonna see drastic reductions in cases/hospitalizations and we’ll start to see phased reductions of restrictions even in more strict places.
20392,But places that require mask mandates will likely do so until at least mid summer to fall at which point given vaccine suppliers live up to their promise basically a large enough percent are vaccinated for herd immunity.
20393,"Then by fall well start to see the return of concerts, weddings, and Unmasked life."
20394,Schools will be 100 percent open and capacity limits will be over.
20395,being said this is contingent upon vaccine suppliers actually living up to their claims which I’m very dubious off given how slow the increase in supply to states has been.

20403,imagine being put on house arrest for a week because 1 dude in the entire state got sick.
20404,horrifically authoritarian
20405,We expect our plumbers to believe that toilets work.
20406,"If you called a plumber and he told you you'd be better off shitting in a corner because ""squatting is better than sitting"" and"" toilets are over rated and shit that gets flushed gets magically transported to a facility where Bill gates uses it to make voodoo dolls of people"", you probably wouldn't hire him again."

20414,"In an ordinary year, the U.S. administers the flu vaccine to over 40% of the population."
20415,Only modest expansion of current logistical capabilities is needed.
20416,The Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna vaccines were more difficult because of the cold storage requirements.
20417,But the Johnson &amp; Johnson vaccine can be stored in an ordinary refrigerator.
20418,"You don’t think much, huh?"
20419,"Voted for Trump, yea?"
20420,I think this is what has enraged me the most with how Europe (in particular Macron...) went on a smear campaign with the AZ vaccine.
20421,So irresponsible.
20422,US - we have a 14 nanosecond streak!
20423,I’m calling bullshit on this.
20424,Because reaching herd immunity should be the goal to lift major restrictions like large gatherings and ending mask mandates.
20425,Just look at a state like NJ.
20426,We were doing great in the summer and as soon as winter hit shit got ugly again.
20427,The goal should be to reach herd immunity through vaccination before a complete return to normalcy.
20428,It’s also not all or nothing.
20429,All these things should be phased.
20430,Ah yes that horrible whore of a company which is manufacturing a life saving vaccine for the world at cost and orders of magnitude cheaper than the currently approved equivalents in the EU.
20431,Perhaps some of the improvements AZ were making on the EU factories yields have given some results and this is where the extra doses are coming from.
20432,Seems a bit cynical to just assume they are pinching from someone elses supply.
20433,"After all, they refused to do that for the UK supply to the EU so why would they do it to anyone else?"
20434,The 30% more deadly hasn’t been proven.
20435,This *possibility* came up a week or two ago with more data apparently to be released in a day or two.
20436,"But that new data never came, and the possibility then became “true”."
20437,It’s weird.
20438,"Like, where is the new data?"
20439,Why did the story die and the possibility become truth?
20440,Isn’t that a person by person question?
20441,"Seems like it’s some combo of where they’re a citizen, where they want to go, and what country will take them."
20442,If there’s nowhere then I guess you have to work that out.
20443,Yeah most here wanted to get it over with and they did
20444,You are splitting hairs because you don’t want to acknowledge that we are all fucked.
20445,But carry on.
20446,What we say doesn’t matter any more.
20447,My dad and his wife yesterday too!
20448,"Within a couple of weeks my whole family should be vaccinated (other than me, I’ll be at the end)."
20449,It’s a really good feeling.
20450,Most probably they are getting better with their yields.
20451,Or these are the doors that AZ was planning to export outside of europe.
20452,[removed]
20453,Very happy to see this!
20454,I really hope the US also adapts AstraZeneca.

20475,i think once this pandemic is behind us there will be a lot of research into finding out why certain states like FL and even TX were able to keep everything open without having super high mortality rates like the Tri-State region.
20476,It may very come down to housing density and prevalence of multi-generational households.
20477,Or maybe even the composition &amp; indoor conditions of their blue-collar non-work-from-home labor force.
20478,You not getting the vaccine actually can harm people who are immunocompromised and can’t get the vaccine.
20479,It’s really a choice that also harms others
20480,There was evidence of this months ago.
20481,This is just further proof.
20482,To the moon!
20483,"I live in a large-ish town outside Glasgow, there are plans to open a mass vaccination centre nearby, and the local GP's are giving out vaccines as well."
20484,It is fixed but the result of the issues means the deliveries are behind.
20485,The UK would have had 30 million doses if everything went right but any country's leadership that expected everything to go right was naïve and unaware of the complexities of vaccine development.
20486,Missing $AZN the whole reason UK is vaccinating so quickly.
20487,I hope we authorize it soon in the US too
20488,Mutations are happening anyways.
20489,As long as key groups get theirs and numbers drop all is good.
20490,But the selected groups are either easier as show id for age or easier and for looking good like show I'd as teacher or healthcare.
20491,Under 65 with a health issue isn't even on the radar as well people could.lie or how tonsils proof.
20492,So whole at risk groups are left out as too hard.
20493,But someone's parents had the vaccine so it is over now.
20494,Some 65 plus are healthier than younger people.
20495,"No, from what I understand, you are saying that life should go on as normal for everyone except those who are high risk (people with underlying conditions and the elderly)."
20496,"What I'm saying is, is that it's impossible to separate these two groups."
20497,"Obesity, diabetes, and old age amount to a huge swath of the population."
20498,"Furthermore, they have to interact with the healthy and working population."
20499,Doesn't the best answer seem to be for everyone to lock down for as long as possible until vaccines and antibodies allow for herd immunity?
20500,"Yeah, having domestic production of vaccines is/was always going to be key."
20501,Lesson to be learnt for next time.
20502,My second grader was depressed and losing his mind with zoom school.

20509,"And apart from this recent lockdown in WA it has been very normal, could do just about anything we wanted that we could do pre covid with some exceptions."
20510,The lockdown happened because we got lax and let people back into the state.
20511,I also wouldn't say the need for vaccines is normal how does not having them make aus further from normalcy?
20512,the need for vaccines is what is further from normalcy than anything as in a state of normalcy vaccines would be unnecessary.
20513,Have to keep doing it.
20514,Unacceptable.

20526,Depends where you are on the country.
20527,Most likely summer for most of it with the exception of california.
20528,Right now we don’t have much data on the vaccines’ ability to stop transmission of the virus from person to person.
20529,It’s mostly just to try to keep our health services from being overwhelmed by keeping people out of hospitals.
20530,Not advocating sinovac but I've read the Brazil test only included high risk people hospital workers and every mild symptom was counted.
20531,The test should be standardized for all vaccines.
20532,"Pittsburgh is ""yinz"""

If perhaps I'm wrong and a lot more people are vaccinated by March/April, fine."
20535,But a million a day still isnt a lot compared to 350 mil in the country.
20536,And children still won't be vaccinated until fall
20537,Thank you.

20662,Sure if you isolate entire ships for 40 days then its obvious that would have an impact on spread.

20689,Hilarious given Melbourne hasn't really had a summer this year due to La Nina.
20690,We've had heater weather and rain for most of ''Summer'' and have had 1 day high 30s.
20691,Our ''Summer'' is pretty much the rest of the country's winter.
20692,&gt;b) not scale up by even more than that?
20693,This I don't understand either.
20694,There is a massive need for this product yet for some reasons capacity seems to have been planed just razor thin at best.
20695,Why did they not increase capacity well over what their initial firm orders were anyway ?
20696,"Even if they did not want or couldn't finance this themselves, there would not have been a single government in the world that would have said no if they had asked them for help."
20697,The fact that they opened a plant in Wales is completely unrelated to the initial supply coming from the EU.
20698,Probably start going back to normal when the elderly/vulnerable have all been vaccinated so maybe around March/April.
20699,By that point deaths/hospitlisations should have gone down considerably.
20700,And by summer majority should be vaccinated
20701,"We have probably less than 70000 vaccinated in Norway because, despite having the money to buy vaccines, we decided it would be best to rely on the EU and now we are bumming spare vaccines off of Sweden."
20702,Also a few other dumb reasons like how to distribute the vaccines was never thought about and now each of the 356 regions are left to figure out their own plan.
20703,You know how much extra you can get done in crunch-time?
20704,"It's not sustainable, but short-term you can get things sorted a lot faster when there's added pressure."
20705,I currently believe AZ fucked up.
20706,"I do not believe AZ was malicious, they likely had a series of unfortunate circumstances combined with overpromising when they wrote the contract."
20707,"So maybe they are right now pushing their employees to work overtime to get this sorted, increasing productivity faster than they originally expected."
20708,15 in the Uk
20709,"Just fyi - the doses are coming from the EU plant, not the UK."
20710,"They’re not being diverted from anywhere else

People are being very conspiratorial in this thread but AZ is just scaling up and increasing capacity in the EU, like they did in the UK."
20711,People forget that the UK didn’t start out with such high yields.
20712,no doubt though that they’re probably moving faster and increasing capacity more urgently than they were before
20713,"Fellow Ohioan here, I think we are mercifully starting to see the vaccines dampen things down a bit."
20714,"I'm hopeful these numbers are going to fall soon to the level to end the curfew, the numbers are tending exactly where we hope"

20727,"Lol, I'm sure YOU wouldn't mind working with a bunch of dumb youngsters who are filled with COVID."
20728,How does this help when the big issue is shortage of doses?
20729,If we had enough doses for everyone sure set up mass vaccination events.
20730,But right now states are either limiting eligibility OR not able to fulfill appointments for everyone eligible due to LACK OF SUPPLY.
20731,Solve supply THEN worry about distribution if it can't keep up.
20732,Everything I've seen is that doses only sit on shelves when they aren't sure WHO should get them.
20733,I’ve sent you one from the manufacturing companies website lol

20747,"I mean, for realz?"
20748,Can’t imagine why?
20749,Teaching isn't what you think it is.
20750,Are Americans going to get the vaccine for free or at cost?
20751,I was worried that the vaccines would have have huge mark ups there like healthcare and many people who dont have insurance or a house they can remortgage would have to go without.
20752,"I would imagine that life is basically back to ""normal"" by memorial day."
20753,"Some things may still be altered, like I don't know if we see a sold out NBA arena this season, but I think most things will be normal"
20754,Glad to hear that.
20755,Which brand of the vaccine is this and how effective is it?
20756,Its the Chicago Public Schools.
20757,It isn't like anybody was learning anything there anyway.
20758,My grandma was one of them!!
20759,So happy.
20760,I'm not sure if this would be allowed.
20761,I guess they would have to be distributed by the EU vaccination scheme equally to everyone who ordered AZ vaccine.
20762,"Yeah I think July 4th is gonna be the first real holiday in a while, especially since it'll be warm and it's already an outside thing."

20868,The government would just pay 50% more.
20869,Pre-existing condition: Tested positive for being Homo-Sapiens
20870,"The first paragraph of the article 

&gt;  Britain’s initial doses of the COVID-19 vaccine candidate developed by AstraZeneca and Oxford University will come from Europe rather than a domestic supply chain, the country’s Vaccine Taskforce said."
20871,I don't get it are you saying data from the CDC and WHO is unreliable?
20872,Cite your research before spreading speculative information.
20873,The main mass vaccination centre where I am (Edinburgh) opens tomorrow.
20874,Hopefully things will get faster but it all depends on the vaccine supply keeping up.
20875,How about the failures of AZ ?
20876,A 20% or even a 30% shortfall could be considered reasonable.
20877,"A 60% to 75% shortfall (depending on whose numbers you believe) is not reasonable, it's rather an indication that AZ did not plan for enough capacity in the first place."
20878,Covid has made a lot of businesses more efficient.
20879,For instance a doctors visit.
20880,Prior to covid I would show up for my Dr appointment on time.
20881,Then I would sign in and be told to have a seat whereby I would read a three year old copy of People magazine and start hating my life.
20882,"An hour later they’d call me in to see the Dr.  Now when I have a Dr appointment i show up at the agreed time , a nurse takes my vitals etc and then I am taken to a room where three minutes later the Dr sees me."
20883,Fantastic.
20884,Why weren’t we always doing it like this?
20885,Same goes for my child’s picture day.
20886,Prior to covid we all showed up at the same time (for individual photos).
20887,Then we waited.
20888,And waited.
20889,And waited.
20890,It was of course dreadful.
20891,But this year I was given a time to show up.
20892,When I showed up they scanned the thingie on my phone and my child went straight to the photographer.
20893,"The whole
process took no more than 15 minutes."
20894,Before it was two hours of waiting around like a jerk.
20895,Covid has taught us a lot of things.
20896,The least of which is that anti maskers are wretched ghouls.
20897,But let’s also not forget how efficient we can be when we really want to be.
20898,Because I have read dozens of scientific papers about transmission dynamics.
20899,"Of course, it’s also possible that someone caught a virus and died from me doing a perfectly reasonable activity before the fall of 2019."
20900,"I don’t feel bad about that if they did, it wasn’t my fault"
20901,Wouldn’t the companies just cut back that vials then?
20902,"The US purchased doses, not vials."
20903,it doesn't like it
20904,"&gt;In my humble but very controversial opinion, people who caught covid either A) didnt follow safe guidelines like masking, distancing, hygiene etc."
20905,"and basically it is their fault and it was preventable or B) they caught covid from a coworker who belongs to A group, which is only partially preventable, because you would have to have a good sealing respirator on all day long or C) who caught it from a housemate who belongs to A group."
20906,"I caught covid (fortunately very mildly), either from taking public transit to or from work or from a trip to the grocery store and honestly I'm getting a bit tired of this rhetoric."
20907,I get the impression it comes from a place of people wanting to feel like they are in control their chances of getting sick.
20908,"There're 300 million people in the United States, even in relatively low risk scenarios some people are going to draw a short straw."
20909,Sometimes shit happens and I worry that moralizing something like catching a virus is going to make it very hard to eventually return to a level of risk tolerance when people are mostly protected by vaccination and covid becomes an endemic disease that's not an acute public health threat.
20910,Knowing when to delegate is also good management.
20911,Yea this kind of makes sense.
20912,Ideally we would have everyone tested just for the sake of better statistics but on the other hand we wouldn't have enough tests even if everyone wanted one.
20913,Ha...infighting.
20914,Still better than France we've done about that many in total

20923,It’d be healing.
20924,"Thanks citation in the article you provided 

“The vaccine is manufactured by two British firms - Oxford BioMedica and Cobra Biologics - with another company, Wockhardt, providing fill and finish capability in what McCubbin said was “a completely integrated UK supply chain”."
20925,Source?
20926,"I mean, if that’s true, then did he break the lockdown rules?"
20927,&gt;  they would have plenty of vaccine.
20928,"They wouldn't, they got started too late."

20935,Same
20936,"Unlike you, I can actually read a source."
20937,Most of it gets filtered and retransmitted by the press though.
20938,You see scientific papers get twisted or poorly reported all the time.
20939,Yes I agree.
20940,But the zero=COVID people are saying restrictions pretty much forever (since we'll never realistically eradicate covid)
20941,Are you serious?
20942,You say that AZ did *not* say they would deliver only 31M out of 80M ordered doses?
20943,The EU and all media have just dreamed that?
20944,This is the most hilarious statement of the week!
20945,"Where I live, the popular opinion is that masks are unnecessary outdoors,  even at crowded events."
20946,"So mask wearing outdoors is ""suggested but not enforced ""."
20947,Meaning hardly anyone wears one.
20948,[removed]
20949,First of all teachers volunteered for that duty and they got paid for it.
20950,Second of all I'm just saying what my experience was and how it was effective.
20951,"I went to a school where the average HOUSEHOLD income was $17,000 per year, yet we had a 95-100% four year college acceptance rate (depending on the year)."
20952,You can't fix a students home life but you can give them the opportunity to escape it.
20953,That's what my school was.
20954,I would not be where I am today without my school nor would most of the kids I graduated with.
20955,Doors opened at 6 am and stayed open until 7 pm.
20956,"It was warm, it was quiet, it was safe, and to top it all off we had internet/computers to do our homework."
20957,We had breakfast and lunch for free every day.
20958,If you were tight with the lunch ladies they would give you the leftovers on Friday so you would have something to eat over the weekend.
20959,I don't think you're realizing how devastating it would be to suddenly have all of that vanish.
20960,I’ve heard this multiple times every month since March.
20961,Yes this plant is the one for supplying the EU also notice the date on this article...
20962,The issue with vaccines is production.
20963,That’s were they don’t help.
20964,But have fun with the propaganda.
20965,The UK factories might have to shift their production volumes to continental EU though.
20966,"Currently the continental factories have problems, which means lower production volume."
20967,"But the contract with the EU says, that the have to ship the doses from the EU as well as the UK based factories."
20968,"So decreasing the delivery for the EU, without deceasing it for the rest of the customers is a breach of contract."
20969,"And the EU seems to plan to stop all exports of vaccines, both from AS, as well as Biontech, until the contract is on plan again."
20970,"This might fuck britain especially hard, since their strategy is to wait as long as possible with the second shot and do it with the then arriving supply."
20971,"If the supply is limited then, they are in major trouble."
20972,I'm Texan and I laughed so hard at this I confused my wife.
20973,Thanks for the laugh.
20974,Spanish flu was 2-3 years wasn't it?
20975,"This is correct, which meant the UK had a 3 month head-start."
20976,Depends on where.
20977,My husband taught for 5 years in California before his school finally enrolled him in a credentialling program last year.
20978,Massive teaching shortage and bare minimum qualifications means just about anyone can teach.
20979,No real requirements necessarily other than a TB test and a few other legal things.
20980,Is that a good thing?
20981,No.
20982,But there are so few good teachers that pretty much anyone with a pulse can get a job teaching here (we are in Oakland).
20983,"That said, lots of ""subject matter experts"" have taught at his school and left after realizing that teaching is 1% about the subject you are teaching and 99% about relationships with students and classroom management."
20984,[deleted]
20985,Is that because surgeries are vaccination centers at weekends and normal work during the week?
20986,"From your profile it looks like you’re in HK, and all I can say is that I’m very glad I’m in Australia right now."
20987,You think the media is lying about how many people have died?
20988,Prove it or fuck off.
20989,You’re saying the tourism and aviation industries are decimated?
20990,"Yes, obviously, and that’s a global occurrence."
20991,Nothing we can do about that but society is still going on as best it can.
20992,"No idea what you’re on about with Fiji and Bali, and how that is at all relevant."
20993,But Australia provides $4bn per year in foreign aid so we’re doing just fine.

21002,I’m in the US and if I had the opportunity to travel someplace with this thing under control I wouldn’t take any chances of messing up a good thing lol
21003,"There is a reason those vaccine producers tied in production to there own Countries, they knew this could happen."
21004,Also helps the UK signed everything and got movement on initial setup three months earlier.
21005,There is no real proof that it’s more severe.
21006,The numbers out of the UK are really too small so far to come to that conclusion.
21007,The scientific group there admits their confidence for it being more severe is only like 40-50 percent and there a lots of regional differences that might explain that
21008,[removed]
21009,"Also apparently the reason we wouldn't sign up to the joint PPE procurement was because of contractual handcuffs the EU tried to put on us around all procurement, including vaccines."
21010,I'm a Remainer and this was reported in The Guardian.
21011,"The UK also made a significant advance payment toward the vaccines months before anyone else, as you've said."
21012,Is Lux Coelho something like the rabbit of light in latin?
21013,Trump had lots of good ideas he never intended to follow through with.
21014,"AZ didn't 'cause a stir', the EU did."
21015,"Look everywhere, you wont find a single report of AZ saying they'll delivery only 60%, or 40%, or 25%, or whatever random number the media has moved on to now."
21016,"And you seem to be confused, the issue isn't fixed."
21017,"It's only improved, still some work before they're meeting expectations."
21018,"As expected, it's not a binary process, they'll get continual small improvements over time."
21019,Sounds an awful lot like Canada.
21020,[removed]
21021,"It's not hoarding, it's 400million orders across 7 different vaccine candidates (as they were in summer 2020) which were never guaranteed to be successful."
21022,It ensured that should 50% of the candidates fail the UK would still have enough doses for the entire population and also meant that whichever vaccine was approved first the UK would be able to immediately crack on.
21023,"Also the 400million are not being made at once, AZ is basically at full production speed in the UK and delivering around 2-3m doses a week."
21024,The more concurrent vaccines you have available delivering similar weekly numbers the quicker you can vaccinate the whole country and provide the rest elsewhere (likely the poorer commonwealth nations who have no orders in place) or forego the rest of the allocation to be diverted to fulfill other states orders.
21025,It's not about the number of doses ordered it's about how quickly you can supply those doses to be able to reduce deaths to a level where you can reopen the economy
21026,Cases is not the problem with this pandemic.
21027,The vast majority is going through covid with mild symptoms and no long term effects.
21028,We need to target the groups at risk first to get a quick response to the vaccination program.
21029,Vaccinating healthy working people first will only delay the pandemic and ultimately kill more people.
21030,Is he more pessimistic than /u/Pessimist2020 ?
21031,Yet UK production is for UK supply until all orders for UK are done.
21032,One of the things that should be indisputable right now is our current Government did well with the investment and procurement of numerous vaccines.
21033,"You can rightfully complain about the woeful reaction to the pandemic in the first place and hit and miss messaging, but this specific part they did much better than most of the world."
21034,&gt;Because EU people aren't practising nationalism when they protect their floundering slow bureaucrats?
21035,"""regardless of what the EU is doing"", also the EU isn't a private company, it literally represents it's constituents unlike AZ


&gt;They didn't contractually agree to any number in the first batches with the EU but sure continue spouting rubbish."
21036,Can you elaborate on this?
21037,"Why is nobody complaining about Pfizer who is not only making a profit but also exporting vaccines to Canada, Israel and others."
21038,Should the EU ask Israel for some of those doses?
21039,There also seems to be a lack of criticism for the EU companies that have taken money but not delivered anything at all.
21040,"For those curious about side effects, I got vaccinated for rabies over the summer and that kicked my ass the 3 separate times I had to go in for that."
21041,"Flu like symptoms, chills, joints aches, fever."
21042,It sucked.
21043,I got the Pfizer first shot Friday night and basically wouldn’t have noticed anything at all if not for my arm being sore.
21044,The rabies shots were way worse.
21045,Fuck you for trying to force division over vaccines in the middle of a pandemic.
21046,Scum.
21047,That depends.
21048,Is Pittsburgh in Ireland?
21049,Didn’t the experts say the holidays were supposed to be the hardest?
21050,We know more now.
21051,It's worth to go back and take a look at what we missed.
21052,It's not.
21053,"We live in the exurban corner of a mostly rural Texas county and the farther you go from the city, the fewer people wear masks."
21054,"Our county and many other rural counties are not enforcing any pandemic measures, it's all strictly voluntary."
21055,"Businesses and individuals can enforce them on their property if they want but they're not required to, and none are being enforced on public property."
21056,It's been that way all along.
21057,"Ummm, the UK is 100% part of Europe, do you mean the EU?"
21058,Lame
21059,"Every few months...

'The next few months could be the hardest'

This pandemic has been hard since the beginning and with the amount of stupidity that exists internationally it continues to be hard as fuck."
21060,Where's a source for this data?
21061,The Superbowl would like to have a word with you.
21062,"México has been doing sub 10,000 a day for a month now, yeah, we're fucked"
21063,"In terms of actual hospitalization and fatality numbers I honestly think it's going to be a LOT better in a month, like falling rapidly."
21064,Cases will take a while longer because there are far more cases than illnesses especially among the young and healthy who are not yet vaccinated.
21065,But cases without illnesses is not really a problem.
21066,When will policy makers start to make rational decisions about lockdowns?
21067,I mean who the hell knows.
21068,Hopefully the tide will turn and they will start to see the economic and mental health side of the problem a little more clearly.
21069,I feel this way too.
21070,I'm so used to casting a 6-foot radius around myself when walking down the street and a little bit of fear shoots up inside me when I see someone approaching without a mask.
21071,It's going to take effort to un-train these reactions and remind myself that everything is okay.
21072,And that's why the pandemic will be harder: no one is caring about scientific advisers anymore like you and expecting that from out of nowhere the pandemic situation will be better.
21073,This weeks TWiV was an especially nice palette cleanser.
21074,They still aren’t convinced the UK variant in particular is that much more transmissible.
21075,"Might have a little more fitness, but they write it down to cultural things."
21076,Remember the UK had pubs open until like mid December.
21077,Those spread the virus like crazy
21078,[deleted]
21079,Also worth noting that the percentage of elderly who are white is drastically higher than the percentage of young people who are.
21080,I'm in disbelief.
21081,You think POWs commit...crimes?
21082,You should actually learn what's the issue here.
21083,They're not fucking carjackers lol
21084,"I really can't be bothered but I just thought that it's amusing that in the first few seconds that I glanced at of your second link there, which you claim shows absolutely no one wearing a mask, shows at least two people wearing masks before it cuts to Sergels torg."
21085,Objectively false.

21088,The IFR is low in India because the average age is low.
21089,"Only about 5% of people are over the age of 65 in India, compared to 13% in the United States, and 22% in a country like Italy."
21090,"Given the majority of deaths are in older demographics, this causes very different cross-country IFRs depending on age distribution."
21091,"Just based on this alone, we'd expect an IFR roughly 2-3X lower in India than in the US and 4-5X lower in Italy."
21092,"Of course, there are other factors (like quality of healthcare) at play as well."
21093,"The places where they are citing the highest infection rates (urban slums) also have very low average age rates, even compared to the rest of the already-young Indian demographic."
21094,"That said, there's also a huge undercounting of COVID-related deaths in India."
21095,"While India has done a decent job with testing given its limited resources, the reality is it is still a developing country."
21096,"It's done ~140K tests per million people, whereas the US (not known for great testing except in select states like New York) has done nearly 1 million per million people."
21097,"While in the US anyone with COVID-like symptoms that dies will get tested which gives us some confidence in our death figures, that is not always true in India, especially in areas with extreme poverty."
21098,It is not unreasonable to believe that 30% of India has been infected.
21099,"The United States has a similar estimated infection rate at this point, and the US as a whole is much less crowded and more hygienic than significant parts of India."
21100,Pfizer is doing everything to fulfill their EU order as soon as possible.
21101,By Q2 they will deliver millions of doses to the EU every day.
21102,"If J&amp;J manage to deliver somewhat what they have promised, everyone will have been offered a vaccine by summer, even with AZ delivering less than half of their original confirmed deliveries."
21103,Moderna is not delivering much atm but are trying to increase their production too.
21104,Always
21105,"In a life or death, ppverty or wealth time when you have massive funding, a more than capable team and ample time?"

21108,Which continent is it part of?
21109,"&gt; Seems like it’s some combo of where they’re a citizen, where they want to go, and what country will take them."
21110,"Yes, those countries don't want them."
21111,"They didnt know which company would end up developing the vaccine first, so they ordered from all of them."
21112,"This is a good thing, and their quick acting is the reason they havent fucked this whole thing up like the EU"
21113,Taking the ill out of Illinois!
21114,Where can I read more about these details?
21115,I'd love to read more about a US city getting back on its feet.
21116,🍪
21117,This is exactly what I was hoping to see.
21118,"As more and more doses become available, and things like J &amp; J hit the scene, the bottleneck moves more and more onto the delivery end of things."
21119,Hoping that hospitals and CVS/Walgreens are going to carry all the load just isn't realistic when you want to move the volume that we need to.

21121,"I would like to see a plan to get mRNA manufacturing capacity in the west to something like 1Billion doses per month, with government financing if need be."

21135,The EU is exporting vaccine even though it's not going so hot (so far nothing has been blocked).
21136,So if the EU would be doing well i don't think that would have changed.
21137,The vaccine will be sold at cost to the developing world in perpetuity.

21144,"Yes, it would be a breach of contract."
21145,"I'm pinning AZ because it's unacceptable to say on such short notice that they couldn't deliver - basically they stripped the EU out of any margin to look for other suppliers, to approve other vaccines, or for EU to withdraw their investment towards other vaccine facilities."
21146,"It's extremely shady to accept funding, compromise the time investment from EMA approval, and 8 weeks before delivery they just figured out they will deliver only 30 million vaccines out of 80-100 million."

21150,They only noticed it last week?
21151,"Absolutely, my Mrs has been papping herself she’ll bring it home from work."

21159,"When Brisbane went into lockdown we went to the grocery store on the Saturday and it was all normal, fully stocked."
21160,I was surprised to be honest.
21161,[85% of COVID patients reported often or always wearing masks according to the CDC.
21162,](https://techstartups.com/2020/10/12/cdc-study-85-covid-19-cases-people-often-always-wear-masks/)
21163,[removed]
21164,Our numbers are horrible.
21165,UK probably vaccinated more people in the last 48 hours than Canada has in the last 2 months.
21166,"&gt; Well I don't know too much about their policies

Yeah, maybe you shouldn't comment if you don't actually know what their COVID policies are."
21167,&gt;just as I can do with florida and california.
21168,Why would you do so with states that allow for travel between them without much restrictions?
21169,It's one of the reasons Finland is doing better than the EU countries that didn't impose any restriction on air travel within EU.
21170,"&gt;Across the board, there are so many examples of places with strict lockdowns and high excess mortality (Peru, Italy, Belgium, UK)

Peru is an impoverished country that has socioeconomic factors which affect the efficacy of its lockdowns."
21171,Italy's two lockdowns did their jobs in suppressing the outbreak.
21172,That obviously require maintenance via things like mask mandates and strict enforcement of social distancing guidelines.
21173,"UK took too long to impose a lockdown, so what's the argument there?"
21174,"&gt;Sweden

Have you looked at Sweden's latest numbers compared to its immediate neighbours?"
21175,You seem to miss the point of a lockdown though.
21176,A *decisive* lockdown is meant to address an outbreak that's surging.
21177,"Once the surge has been dealt with, the goal is to re-open gradually while maintaining the aforementioned measures along with contact tracing and isolation/quarantines."
21178,Whoever said a lockdown was needed for a year?
21179,"If that's the case, then it's a failure from the top down."
21180,I would certainly blame the previous administration - because their inability to coordinate state lockdowns is why they see such reduced efficacy and increased duration in the US.
21181,"&gt;https://ourworldindata.org/search?q=excess+mortality

Your link literally shows high numbers for excess mortality and you somehow conclude that COVID deaths are overcounted, really?"
21182,"&gt;https://www.pandata.org/

Why don't you link to the actual peer-reviewed study then?"
21183,"&gt;My views are rational thinking, looking at the actual benefit of what we are doing, versus the enormous cost."
21184,What's the enormous cost facing countries like China and Australia again?
21185,New Zealand?
21186,Finland?
21187,Singapore?
21188,Vietnam?
21189,"&gt;If we try to stop the spread for a couple months fine, but once its here it isn't going anywhere."
21190,"Nope, but it can be managed so that hospitals and frontline workers don't get overwhelmed."
21191,The numbers can be reduced via measures so that contact tracing is effective and clusters can be detected early and contained.
21192,The most effective way so far is through a decisive and *federally co-ordinated* lockdown.
21193,When did that happen in the US?
21194,"&gt;Suicides, drug overdose, domestic abuse, diagnosed cancers, child abuse, depression, loneliness all have skyrocketed through this pandemic."
21195,"Funny, why don't you see that happening in countries with stricter lockdowns than the US?"
21196,It's almost as though having the necessary stimulus to tide people through the lockdown helps.
21197,&gt;I know people that aren't getting cancer treatment because of this.
21198,People don't get access to such treatments if hospitals are overwhelmed too.
21199,Is that better?
21200,&gt;But I also have loved ones that are seriously comprised by these measures.
21201,"The difference is we have no control over a virus, we have control over the measures though."
21202,The failed measures under Trump =/= a properly implemented lockdown being ineffective.
21203,Not having mask mandates or enforced social distancing guidelines to ensure businesses can be opened safely =/= lockdowns not working.
21204,You seem to shift all the failures of poor leadership towards lockdowns.
21205,Why?
21206,&gt;Yeah i actually support Sweden's approach.
21207,"https://www.cnbc.com/2020/11/17/sweden-toughens-up-coronavirus-rules-as-infections-and-deaths-rise.html

These measures?"
21208,"Funny, they share many similarities with lockdowns."
21209,"I guess you're fine with it if it just isn't called one, right?"
21210,&gt;Meanwhile people were still visiting family and friends.
21211,Finland had a lockdown for 2 months from Feb to April 2020.
21212,After which they've actually had looser restrictions than Sweden.
21213,The same goes for New Zealand.
21214,It goes the same for many countries with strict lockdowns.
21215,"Meanwhile, unlike those countries, Sweden had to impose much stricter measures last November."
21216,The result?
21217,"Stricter measures for a couple of months in exchange for an economy that recovers more quickly, in exchange for returning to normalcy sooner and in exchange for far fewer cases/deaths."
21218,I think it's obvious which choice I'll choose.
21219,&gt;taking into account the well being of society as a whole.
21220,Tell that to the high number of COVID deaths Sweden has from the start.
21221,Or tell that to the elderly in care homes who were effectively forced into lockdown via isolation until September 2020.
21222,That's not 'a whole' as you're positing.
21223,People don't come back from death or even long term sequelae.
21224,"As someone who's young, I absolutely can deal with a quick lockdown without issue."
21225,That's part of the whole picture that you seem to be ignoring.
21226,[deleted]
21227,That’s amazing.
21228,"You gotta hand it to them, they’ve put their foot on the gas."
21229,I wish the US would force other pharmaceutical companies to make this vaccine.
21230,It's pointless to be injecting people with less effective vaccines when we have Pfizer and Moderna available.
21231,The NHS is amazing.
21232,Also the whole process from production to filling the vials is in the UK so it's quite straightforward.
21233,No
21234,im shredded bro
21235,Strain does not mean variant.
21236,SARS-CoV-2 has many variants and getting several variants of a disease is nothing new.
21237,The immune response by the body will resist both variants since all variants of this virus have the same N-protein structure that is recognized by the immune system.
21238,Even people who got infected by SARS in 2002 have some sort of immunity to this new virus.
21239,Fact check.
21240,"I'm sorry bro, but if you didn't want to be close to people then you shouldn't have flown...."
21241,And what does this knowledge do to the origin story?
21242,"Right, but tailgates are outside."
21243,So you've gone from UK exports being forbidden to just the UK not offering help?
21244,Those graphs are scary af.
21245,We can't seem to win for losing.
21246,"As with every other model I've looked at, this one reinforces the likelihood that preventative measures like masks and social distancing will save a lot more lives than the vaccines over the next three months."
21247,"The best way to know if someone has a legal case:

Do they fight in a court of law, or the court of public opinion through press briefings."
21248,"If it's the latter, they know they don't have a case."
21249,The EU chose the latter.
21250,"When the lawyers give the thumbs down, they backed down have gone silent and called for a reset."
21251,The Gamble was they went with 3 - 4 weeks in the first place as it was the shortest time frame they could trial and get potential results.
21252,The vaccines own maker suggest 12 weeks won't make it any worse and can potentially be better.
21253,In the mean time it logically makes sense for the entire population to get the first dose as soon as possible when it gives such a boon for having it done.
21254,His only remaining symptoms is his voice is a little human
21255,most airlines are pretty spotty with their safety measures now.
21256,Delta is the best from what i've heard
21257,Of course I would trade 1 year of my life to save hundreds of thousands of people.
21258,That's not what's being asked for.
21259,"What's being asked for is _billions_ of people to _all_ trade 1 year of their life to save a few hundred thousand people, which is a totally different calculation."
21260,"The data that it spreads more quickly never moved past ""could"" either."
21261,"But, it spreading faster has also become a ""fact"" for most people."
21262,"I don't know about you, but at my super bowl parties we all french kiss each other every touch down."
21263,Take doses?
21264,Where did it say that EU wanted to take doses?
21265,Is it safe to do so?
21266,You are correct sir.
21267,I think the EU has the bigger leaver there.
21268,No more exports of vaccines anymore and whole of europe is vaccinated in a couple months.
21269,"This would leave scorched soil, but if one party tries to breach the contract the soil is already burning."
21270,A bit creepy lol
21271,Apparently some people think the Súper Bowl will drive cases up.
21272,I only like the commercials they play in between.
21273,"That sounds amazing, thanks for your service mate!"
21274,The Super Bowl itself is at severely reduced capacity and there have been countless games throughout football season with the same measures.
21275,"As for parties, most Super Bowl parties are small gatherings and not all-out ragers."
21276,The average Saturday in the fall almost certainly has as many tailgates.

21278,It’s fine to have him on the task force you need multiple points of view but he needs to stay out of the media.

21280,It’s working for him but not for the country
21281,&gt;The Belgian far right used an image of Auschwitz in its campaign against public health measures and vaccinations.
21282,"Wow, just when you think they couldn't go any lower..."
21283,This whole thread praising the UK.
21284,We mishandled this pandemic to a criminal degree and the only reason we've got such a high rate of vaccination is backing out of another deal.
21285,People saying this is a 'victory for Brexit' are missing the fact that underhanded tactics like this is why we're getting the shitty end of any trade deal.
21286,What was it like?
21287,Did it feel emotional after all of this?
21288,She's in her 70s but has always been in exceptional health.
21289,Call came from her local GP surgery.

21291,The only airline I know of that is still blocking middle seats is Delta.
21292,"Fuck off, direct your hate somewhere its actually justified you piece of shit."
21293,The United Kingdom has nothing to do with how badly the EU fucked this up.

21295,It is amazing how you swedes continuously twist the argument.
21296,The videos speak for themselves and I know many will watch them.
21297,So even if you are trying to divert the attention people will notice eventually.
21298,"Emotional investment in points is for other people, and certainly never you, right?"
21299,No as it’s all bs so you’re rightly downvoted.
21300,The EU made the contract visible for all so you can read for yourself why no doses have been stolen.
21301,You also have to remember that 20% or so of adults won't get it.
21302,The reason the UK is so well positioned right now it is funded many trails and vaccine Companies.
21303,It was better to order 1 Billion doses if if their is a chance only 100m will be viable.
21304,Having more isn't a bad thing as the companies are funded to produce it.
21305,"If the UK end up with more stock it'll just go to other Countries, ain't no one hoarding in a Pandemic."

21312,"once pretty much everyone considered vulnerable is vaccinated, then what ?"
21313,Likewise... stay strong.
21314,AZ has been less than honest to the media.
21315,"In fact, the original orders from the EU were from a vaccine alliance of 4 countries months earlier that was later continued by the EU27."
21316,If you're referring to the UK then you're deluded.
21317,Things aren't going to be back to normal just because people are vaccinated.
21318,"This has changed society permanently, we may get back to a new normal in the next year or two, but certainly not in the next 3 months."
21319,"It’s funny, but way below the headline, he clarified that it isn’t something guaranteed to happen, but only a possibility if we don’t get ahead of the issue through mass vaccination and other measures."
21320,Which we currently project to do
21321,"&gt; is this because vaccines are working right

Probably not - the peak in cases was the very first week of the year, before a meaningful amount of vaccines had been distributed."
21322,"IMO (not an expert though), it is dropping because of seasonality."
21323,"All the common human coronaviruses (i.e., the ones that cause colds) peak in the winter or early spring, so it seems Covid is doing the same thing."
21324,"This is good news, as it will give us ample time to vaccinate people over the spring and summer, and hopefully avoid another major wave in the fall."
21325,Do you have a source for him saying summer?
21326,I need to balance out this bad news.

21328,Who are you shouting at?
21329,!
21330,I agree.
21331,"We need a service corps of primary care doctors, nurses, allied health personnel, mental health professionals, social workers, educators, logistics personnel, etc who serve full time."
21332,Recruit them with free college/grad school tuition in exchange for 5 or 6 years of service.
21333,They can be stationed in underserved low income communities in normal times and then be activated at a moment's notice to deal with shortages and emergencies.
21334,Show me any country in the world where the tourism and aviation industries are doing well.
21335,"That’s not an Australia issue, that’s a world issue"
21336,Would be great if they found some drugs that fixed damaged lungs after the infection.
21337,I would like to get running again but still get out of breath climbing the stairs 9 months later.
21338,Yes.
21339,"Plus it might just be more fit by a little bit, but transmission is the same"
21340,30 if you have a history of reactions to previous vaccines.
21341,15 if you have not.
21342,"For you, certainly."
21343,But then you never had any intention of trying to interpret it honestly.
21344,Please could you quote the bit that you think shows that they manufactured vaccines that were then shipped to the UK?
21345,I read it twice and couldn't see it.

21350,"Alongside meat pies, confusing flags, and genocide."
21351,We got rather good at those.
21352,I don't see the relevance of your comment.
21353,Parent comment I was replying to was concerned for guards bringing covid back to the US.
21354,"If the vaccine doesn't stop transmission, some guard travel between Cuba and the US isn't going to make a bit of difference."
21355,"Oh, ok."
21356,Norway is still really close with the EU.
21357,They basically join in the parts they want to be in.
21358,"Understanding it on the other hand, has proven a bigger challenge."
21359,FYI I replied to this agreeing with it and it was removed because I quoted an opposition argument that contained language that triggered the automod.
21360,"But yeah, I don’t get the hoarding arguments since most developing countries have younger populations that are less at risk anyway."
21361,"Thank you for the clarification and good wishes, my friend."
21362,"A plus side to this is that idiots (like Covid-19 deniers or people who think they'll survive it anyway and don't care if they get it - remember when ""Covid Parties"" were a thing?)"
21363,will not be able to breed and that's a GOOD thing.
21364,"An overwhelming pity about everyone else who wears masks and tries to social distance and keep themselves safe, but sometimes get infected by the idiots above who DON'T protect themselves and others by doing the right thing in the first place...

(Other people here have said WORSE.)"
21365,B117 has been in the US since at least early November (see the latest paper on that).
21366,If it was that much more infectious why wouldn’t we be starting to see it out compete other variants now?
21367,"We had massive surges a month or two ago, 50 million traveled for Thanksgiving, etc."
21368,Yet in California it’s estimated as of late January only at 0.4 or so of cases are of B117.
21369,And that’s right after a surge in Southern California.

21374,"You can buy a car, but the driver is the one responsible for how fast and how well it operates."
21375,"I have news for you, if the vaccines end up not working, almost all normal people will conclude ""well, I guess we can't beat this thing"" and start living life normally again, albeit with a slightly reduced average life expectancy."
21376,You are welcome to stay at home forever if you want to.
21377,It absolutely did not have to be done.
21378,"In what conceivable way would Northern Ireland, which has lots of vaccines, take doses from Ireland, which has very few?"
21379,"Surely based on this argument, the uk would want to impose border checks to ensure no stock leak to the uk?"
21380,"Only it won’t do that because we know how fragile the peace agreement is, but sure, the EU can just disregard that and say “oops never mind, don’t overreact lol”."
21381,"Yeah you are right, because it's literally my First name in Latin (Lucas  &gt; Lux) and my last name Coelho (rabbit in english)."

21386,"At 600,000 doses a day: 159 days to vaccinate everyone."

21393,Exactly.
21394,Those of us living in these places who are high risk and/or care about the pandemic and community health need to find ways to get our vaccines.
21395,"Fortunately for Britain, the contract the EU has with Astrazenica doesn't say anything of the sort."
21396,Certainly not in the kind of unambiguous way that won't take lawyers months to establish.
21397,Silly fools errand that has prevented hundreds of people dying.
21398,"Obviously it cannot be permanently eradicated, so what we’re doing -  limiting transmission when it’s discovered - *is* beating the virus."

Its really surprising how badly the EU dropped the ball."

21455,Some of them do get vaccinated and most of them keep quarantined as needed though.
21456,More important is to fix the production and distribution issues and get it in arms as quickly as possible.
21457,"The governments had a year to plan for this, it is criminal that the vaccine process is so disjointed and confusing."
21458,Wasting time by debating who is most deserving is just causing confusion and delays.
21459,Time to set up 24/7 mass distribution centers with a central sign up for each state.

21461,What’s your prediction for when WHO official declares the pandemic/PHEIC officially over?
21462,I suspect it will take a few years because of how hard it will be to wrangle across certain countries with worse health care infrastructure.
21463,Not sure why you were downvoted; I was wondering the same thing
21464,glad to see that some people in the rural red zones of America are taking the necessary steps
21465,Does anybody have a link to the j&amp;j results?
21466,"I'm not sure if they have published for general public yet, but would like to read into the numbers some."
21467,You couldn’t be more wrong.
21468,Yes children are low risk in the sense that they don’t need to be hospitalized when they contract COVID.
21469,But we know absolutely nothing about the long term side effects that Covid could have on children that continue to contract it.
21470,Not to mention you are now literally creating a variant breading ground that puts all adults at risk.
21471,If we have learned anything it’s that Covid learns and adapts very rapidly.
21472,"Throwing 4,000 kids into one building day after day is going to create a variant that ends up not being protected by the current vaccine and putting us back in the same position we are in now."
21473,Without there being a children’s vaccine I don’t see how it would even be remotely possible to have anything other then remote learning or social distanced hybrid learning
21474,Guarantee they all vote GOP.
21475,We need to have an honest conversation about the danger of the right.
21476,What does mask wearing have to do with rural populations not having local access to a vaccine and needing to drive to get it?
21477,"I think eventually there might be, for travel."
21478,Refuse to pay for journalism?
21479,😱
21480,"IDK, the elderly are certainly more at risk of severe illness, but wouldn’t essential workers be more likely to catch and spread the infection?"

21498,Plus the added daycare costs from Hybrid are significant.

21502,"To be clear, the smaller iPhones wouldn't worry, even the new ones."
21503,"So what I really meant to say was,  the expensive iphones."
21504,"It wouldn't work on my android, brand new, it wouldn't work on my mom's fairly new iPhone sc."
21505,"So when I took her,  I had the print out from the computer and hotspotted and iPad for the qr code."
21506,The android app now let's me login but I will probably take the iPad as a backup when I take her for the second shot.
21507,&gt;There is no way the government set themselves a target they did not expect to beat.
21508,"“We will have had 20m deliveries, so let’s say 15m is a stretch goal”

Actually this kind of Target is government's norm here."
21509,We've met this one because the government put the military and NHS in charge(including coming up with the target)and didn't mess it up like they normally do.
21510,Nobody ever expects our government to meet their own targets anymore.
21511,Exactly.

21516,"When I received my second dose, they had a checklist of who was eligible."
21517,You had to show your card then they marked your name on a list.
21518,"Your concern is not legitimate - it is FUD (there is no data that indicates long term effects and no theoretical reason to believe why this vaccine would have long term effects) and your belief that JnJ can ""give their production capacity to another company's more effective vaccine"" shows your absolute ignorance on vaccine types."
21519,"JnJ's vaccine is adenovirus-based, which is different than Novavax's protein subunit vaccine, which is different from the mRNA vaccines from Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna."
21520,They use fundamentally different production processes and are by no means interchangeable.
21521,"Excluding a few widely available chemical precursors, the only major supply chain overlap across those three families starts at the glass vials used to store the end vaccine."
21522,Anyone who doesn't realize that should probably not be having a debate about who should manufacture vaccines or the relative safety of said vaccines.
21523,"Your comments are FUD, pure and simple."
21524,Why aren’t they doing second doses?
21525,We had a community case last week.

21533,"The regulatory framework we have is still figuring out what the approach should be, but from what I have read, for all of these vaccines they wont need another phase 3 trial."
21534,"Flu vaccines which have been modified for this years strain typically don't require a full 30,000 person trial in order to get regulatory approval and these shouldn't either."
21535,I doubt it.
21536,I have virtual school and I had a snow day last week.

21546,What a world of difference there is between herd immunity via vaccines vs. herd immunity via widespread infections.
21547,Everyone who supported the latter has got to be feeling pretty stupid right now.
21548,Nope EU hasn't purchased Novovax yet.
21549,Late again
21550,I have a question about the vaccine.
21551,My parents are  are elderly in their 60s and both were infected with Covid.
21552,luckily they are in their 16th day and their worst days are behind them.
21553,They want to get the vaccine but is it appropriate for them to get it now?
21554,i think they are still symptomatic  as they have a lingering cough and my mother cant smell or taste anything still.
21555,you're right to be angry... it's not fair.
21556,But that's how democracy works.
21557,Those under 40 don't have the political will or power to impact policies as much as those over 50.
21558,"It's partly because younger ppl are less engaged with issues, as well as having less wealth to influence politicians."
21559,"Also, those in positions of leadership in government, business &amp; even education/culture are middle-aged &amp; older, so they're looking after their own health &amp; safety."
21560,We ordered 2 million AZ doses for Q1 and AZ notified us in mid January that they will only deliver 600.000 although we paid them to start manufacturing in October.
21561,They could send them off with a goody bag of syringes.
21562,You mean the peace corp?
21563,YES!
21564,YES!
21565,YES!
21566,YES
21567,Perhaps combining them could be even more accurate.
21568,I'd keep the masks and ventilation going until all the vulnerable people in your household are protected.
21569,Exactly.
21570,"Additionally there’s no proof yet that the vaccine can prevent transmission, but we know it prevents severe illness and death, we need to focus it on those most at risk for that, the elderly and people with high-risk co-morbidities."

21581,It's weird obesity is such a critical criteria for a virus.
21582,The virus is body-shaming!
21583,"LOL (sorry, had to :)  It's odd that obesity and lungs are so connected.."
21584,I wonder if one day we'll learn why.
21585,"Anyway, Godspeed and hoping for some relief for you guys soon!"
21586,The military has been shoring up hospitals all pandemic long.
21587,"Not as dramatic as hospital tents, but far more effective."
21588,"If the only thing Brexit accomplished is their 10x faster speed of vaccination vs the rest of the EU, it will have been absolutely worth it."
21589,"Yes, it was a major public health failing that the prevailing message was ""stay home or die"" rather than encouraging safe behaviors like eating outdoors, hiking, going to a park, etc."
21590,"Maybe we didn't know better last March-April, but we've certainly known since the summer."
21591,"Honestly man, do you not have access to google?"
21592,"https://hms.harvard.edu/news/how-covid-19-causes-loss-smell

“Conditions that contribute to not regaining sense of smell and taste are further triggered by depression and anxiety.”

You people on here all obviously suffer from a high degree of anxiety since you are all writing me this."
21593,"Relax, you will be fine."
21594,"If corona does not kill you, which it won’t if you are under 50."
21595,You will get sick and recover and back to 100%.
21596,Chill out.
21597,Stop spreading fear.
21598,"Lift lockdown, that will cure a lot of depression and a bunch of people that lost taste and smell."
21599,Thankfully the new Biontech plant in Marburg (Germany) is now up and running.
21600,"It will take a while after P3 trials to get approval and get production up to widespread levels, would expect Novavax to arrive in the UK a couple of months before Curevac in the UK."
21601,"According to the Oxford scientists it takes about 3 months to get their production to a good level, that may apply to Curevac too"
21602,Nope... covid wards in all hospitals are empty.
21603,Covid care centres have been shut down due to lack of patients.
21604,And no dead bodies on the street (or in our backyards).
21605,I’m not denying there’s an undercount of deaths.
21606,But it’s not to an extent where we missed more than a million deaths.
21607,Also most sero surveys in India peg the IFR at between 0.07% to 0.11% depending on the demographics.
21608,Facts the least they could do is throw us a bone with some student debt forgiveness but that's never gonna happen
21609,Imo because of the connection to eating exotic animals and illegal wet markets.
21610,Lol good luck to the old farts who try to make me social distance past this spring
21611,We are opening a lot more vaccination centres.
21612,Got around 10 super centres at things like football (soccer) stadiums.
21613,Also we are now vaccinating the 70+ group and most of these drive and can get around easier than than 80+ group where a lot also reside in care homes.
21614,So things are easier and quicker.
21615,I pray you're right I just wanna travel again lol
21616,It's basically just a re election strategy.
21617,Roll out the vaccines right before the election to look good.
21618,We are bad at many things.
21619,But give us this moment.
21620,It’s a stereotype but it is 100% true.
21621,"We also know to let old people to the front of queues already, we can virtual queue (when you all stand on the platform but remember who got there first), and we know to say ‘thanks after you’."
21622,(Our only queueing weakness as it creates a standoff).
21623,"People who abuse a queue system are publicly shamed, so much that they would not dare."
21624,"(I was proud of the shaming of millionaires in the USA, but the idea that ‘oh well, they do that’ was too accepting.)"
21625,We were designed for this.
21626,I gave all my Soldiers flu shots as a medic.
21627,They could do the same to civilians.
21628,Just pull a 68W or 2 from every BN.

21634,1.1m first doses.
21635,If we just hold this pace of first doses we're in an extremely good place
21636,Your article is literally about prioritization.
21637,"As in, rich young athletes shouldn't be getting vaccines before some grandma in an assisted living home."
21638,Emergency use authorization approval
21639,"If we are not completely back to normal by 2022 the country will have bigger problems than missing festivals, such as a bigger economic downturn than the great depression and massive civil unrest."
21640,"&gt;We don't know what's in the UK contract exactly, other than the fixed number of doses."
21641,"Well the public knows the EU contract, it was release and it's not hiding behind it."
21642,"Unlike the UK that claims it's for ""security reasons""."
21643,&gt;The UK government put together the coalition of organisations to manufacture the AZ vaccine.
21644,The vaccine would not exist without the large amount of funding and organisational help.
21645,"Just like BioNTech received funding from EU, so the vaccine that kicked off USA, UK and Isreal wouldn't exist either - imagine the EU claiming all European supply for themselves."
21646,"&gt;Why shouldn't the UK get a preferential contract over the EU, given the amount of effort, and the fact that the EU signed 3 months later than the UK, leaving little time for manufacturing development?"
21647,"Also note that this vaccine is sold at cost, is freely given to others who want to manufacture it (like India and the EU)."
21648,"Well that seems to be a problem for AZ that's signing contracts that can't be fulfilled, ain't it?"
21649,"Missing 70 million doses out of 100 million, with a 2 month notice?"
21650,Are you kidding me?
21651,"70 million doses is enough to immunize 90% of German population, this isn't a ""ups we didn't manage to make 1 million doses :(""."
21652,"It was AZ that said they would sell at cost, it wasn't EU that claimed that."
21653,"The EU is buying BioNTech vaccines with a margin on top of cost, just like every other country."
21654,It was AZ that said they had the production capacity to deliver 100 million doses by March up until last week.
21655,"The EU didn't demand that vaccines would have to be produced in specific places, neither that any contract would compromise the agreement - you should check the contract it's pretty clear."
21656,"If they didn't have time to fulfill such orders, then maybe they shouldn't have taken the contract, right?"
21657,"Basically they breached the contract, compromised the vaccination programme that could have been invested into other vaccines like BioNTech or even get approval to China or Russia vaccine instead of wasting time with AZ trial."
21658,"I haven't been in a fight since 6th grade, but I would not hesitate to throat punch one of these assholes if they jeopardized the opportunity of my family member to get vaccinated."
21659,"Apologies, that’s my fault for misreading the data!"
21660,"I would assume those getting a second dose are mainly healthcare workers - a small percentage of people don’t turn up for their first doses and so instead of wasting vaccines, they’re jabbed into the nearest bodies!"
21661,Better than chucking them away.
21662,I had it and tested positive at the end of December.
21663,"I could taste the whole time but lost my sense of smell actually after I started to recover, and it still hasn’t come back."
21664,I can smell some things some times but it’s weird... it’s like I can only catch a smell if I’m not paying attention.
21665,Like I’ll walk into a room and say “Oh it smells good in here!” And then I’ll try to figure out what it smells like and can’t.
21666,If I pick something up and sniff it I usually get nothing.
21667,Like spring breeze nothing.
21668,Even potent things like minced garlic.
21669,It’s so weird.
21670,It’s cool in a way because I’ve had a MUCH easier time with keeping my cats’ litter boxes clean (not nearly as unpleasant to be around them now) but I’m also so paranoid now that I or my house will stink and I won’t know it.
21671,Also there’s the fact that it’s neurological damage that I don’t know if I’ll really ever recover from so that’s fun.
21672,The real reason is the right wing govt wants to roll them out right before the election to look good.
21673,What you said doesn’t make any sense.
21674,Aren't you supposed to wait to be observed for 30 minutes after you get it?
21675,Not all of the stores are vaccinating.
21676,There are only several stores in a district that are depot stores that are sending out people to vaccinate.
21677,"At each nursing home, we vaccinate anywhere from 150-200 people a day, and there are numerous clinics we run per day."
21678,"At the same time, we are running the pharmacy short staffed with a high volume of scripts because some techs and pharmacists are going out to vaccinate."
21679,We also do not get compensated well at all for our jobs while the higher ups receive all of the profits of our work.
21680,I would say we are doing the best we can despite the circumstances.
21681,Thanks for the criticism though!
21682,!
21683,"To be fair, the current wave will probably be over before vaccinations have any greater effect on the spread for most countries."
21684,Vaccines will prevent future waves.
21685,It's the fire retardant paint you paint your house with after it has been rebuilt.
21686,When do people expect life to get back to normal?
21687,Like everything open again and the virus gone?
21688,By summer?
21689,Which media and “experts” are saying that?
21690,The vaccine will be widely available to everyone by then.
21691,No thanks.
21692,When hospitalizations are down these sites get fewer clicks.
21693,"I mean,  it's a hotel quarantine guard,  I would presume he or she was doing the right thing and just caught a very contagious disease."
21694,We've seen things like this enough times at this point that I feel like we're all comfortable doing the quick lockdown/ back to normal life thing.
21695,I'm optimistic that we can manage this through till everyone gets vaccinated.
21696,"More like 20 minutes, it’s not rocket science."
21697,and yet zoomers and millennials are the first ones to shame people for not complying because it makes them sound woke
21698,CDC updated.
21699,31.1m doses administered
21700,I'm optimistic that as more people are vaccinated others will become more comfortable getting vaccinated themselves.
21701,At our first clinic roughly 238 out of 250 people signed up to be vaccinated.
21702,"Of the 12 who declined, eight cited distrust of the vaccine as their reason (the other 4 were medical)."
21703,When we scheduled our second clinic all but one had changed their minds and decided to get the vaccine.
21704,I think a big part of getting distrustful people vaccinated will be seeing people in their lives get it and be fine.
21705,Fist pump.
21706,"EU should, but probably not for themselves, but on behalf of the billions of people in the parts of the world that are lagging behind in vaccination."
21707,Many countries in the world are not even sniffing the vaccines.
21708,We do not want a new mutation to fuck us...
21709,The newest research shows closing schools to be the second most effective way to decrease R value of the virus.
21710,Second largest.

21714,Even the at home saliva tests are easy to operate.
21715,Very helpful.
21716,Netanyahu has an election coming up and he is trying to make israel the first country to crush covid to boost his chances.
21717,"At the same time, he relies on the orthodox community to win."
21718,The problem is they don't give a fuck about regulations and are screwing up his efforts.
21719,"If he clamps down on them, he could lose their support."
21720,Hilarious predicament he is in
21721,And excess deaths?
21722,Try the TWiV podcast with Daniel Griffin.
21723,He’s good at clinical updates.
21724,And don't forget that those who lost the use of their legs due to the polio virus totally got to walk again later!
21725,"(/s, in case that was necessary)"
21726,No.
21727,Don't downvote me just because you disagree with me.
21728,As I have already said if you are a sceptic you can compare deaths in 2020/21 with the 5-year rolling average using ONS data.
21729,These are excess deaths that would not have happened due to obesity alone: coronavirus caused it and in your example obese are more likely to die than healthy weight.
21730,No amount of denial can change the excess deaths number compared to the 5 year rolling average.
21731,Coronavirus is causing it.
21732,Yeah it’s not that deadly for me to care “forever”.
21733,If they don’t hurry up really not gonna care anymore.
21734,I’m at high risk of catching it anyways so it’s not really my problem.
21735,"Not yet, hopefully this week they submit their application."
21736,Do you think Australia does not have imports?
21737,Digusting.
21738,I think you might be oversimplifying it.

21740,So don't go to a bar or restaurant?
21741,"If other people want to go, and they're open, that's their choice."
21742,"It is true, unless you are living in an underground bunker."
21743,"If there is uncontrolled spread anywhere,  mutations continue to mount."
21744,RNA viruses like this mutate rapidly.
21745,With every mutation there is a risk it will be a dangerous one.
21746,"Perhaps even one that our current vaccines have reduced or zero effectiveness against, and we would be in a world of hurt."
21747,"So even if you are vaccinated, uncontrolled spread anywhere on this highly interconnected planet, is a risk to you."
21748,There's no case to make for it.
21749,No benefit.
21750,"Your goal is to prevent deaths, the elderly make up the largest fraction of deaths, and they're a much smaller fraction of the population than young people."
21751,Vaccinate them first.
21752,Third world countries have a shitload of diseases.
21753,"That doesn't make them ""pandemic""..."
21754,"I believe his full title is Sir Tom Moore (Captain, RAC Rtd)."
21755,In some European countries retired military officers are referred to by their rank and retired (ex.

21800,The situation isn’t perfect but it also isn’t as bad as this article makes out.
21801,"I posted a similar thought in yesterday’s daily discussion thread — fixating on the percentage of people vaccinated, rather than the *results* of the vaccinations, will ultimately lead to those who have gotten vaccinated being held hostage by those who haven’t."
21802,"Vaccines are a means to an end, and the *end* (dropping cases/hospitalizations/deaths to a sustainable point where they don’t cause a strain on health care systems) is all that matters."
21803,"The percentage of people vaccinated should *only* matter as a tool to reach the end, and should *never* be considered in a vacuum, or be used as a threat to say “if 80% of you don’t get vaccines, you’re never getting your life back”."

21821,"The ""we don't know if the vaccine prevents transmission"" talking point is so moronic and it's being parroted by my University and all their lapdogs here."
21822,"Vaccines prevent transmission, if they didn't, herd immunity wouldn't exist."
21823,There is no way to run an RCT on transmission because you can't intentionally infect people.
21824,People with a vaccine should be free to live normally.
21825,"I've taken this seriously since the start of the pandemic, but fuck this."

21853,That’s why you should follow the guidelines of the clinical trials instead of making shit up and delaying the second shot for 6 months.
21854,Yup.

21865,You can still be pro-life and advocate for people have the freedom to make their own choices.
21866,"What a lot of pro-lifers are concerned with, however, is when those choices threaten the lives of others."
21867,You have the EU to thank for that.
21868,Let me guess.
21869,Two weeks?
21870,"Probably not because of vaccines yet, at least not really."
21871,"If you look at Israel, they're experiencing a drop similar to ours despite having way more of their population vaccinated."
21872,"Just avoid the 2009 ACA trap where Rs wasted a year pretending to negotiate with Obama and then admitted that even if he acceded to all of their demands, they still wouldn't vote yes."
21873,"Have them make their compromise demands publicly so that they can't backtrack, and then get something passed quickly with or without them."
21874,We don’t know how long vaccinations will protect from the virus.
21875,It Samens likely this virus will become a common virus strain for the foreseeable future and vaccination against it a regular occurrence.
21876,True but deaths at 40 are statistically very rare from COVID.
21877,The bigger threat for young people would be the burden on hospitals that comes from elderly people getting COVID.
21878,This also seems like an odd time to finally bring up the QALY argument.
21879,"If you point out that the elderly are disproportionately affected by COVID as an anti-lockdown argument, you get called a grandma murderer."
21880,But it's valid as an argument against vaccinating those same people?
21881,"Not even three percent, is it?"
21882,FYI the US has an export ban for us made covid vaccines so in fact that are hoarding.
21883,This is why Canada is only getting EU made vaccines.

22050,"They know that when their time is up as being useful idiots, they'll go back to their miserable lifestyle that will be out of fashion by the summer."
22051,They really will have to up the standards of PPE and ventilation and distances and training of staff to keep the new variants contained
22052,Are you travelling from within the UK?
22053,"If yes, then maybe, but be cautious with your money and be prepared to get refunds."
22054,"Don't start yet though IMO

From outside the UK don't count on it."
22055,There will be a degree of paranoia on the borders over possible new variants and even if borders open they could shut in a days notice
22056,Mild diseases don't kill millions.
22057,It is his word choice and rhetoric.
22058,It's super intense and makes for perfect headlines.
22059,Great.
22060,Now maybe everyone can shut the mother fuck up about it.
22061,"Based on all we know about vaccine and immune response, it is likely *suboptimal* to get it at 3 weeks."
22062,"If you want to maximize efficacy but still want to follow the manufacturer recommendation, you should get it at 28 days."
22063,"The 21-28 window was selected by Pfizer (and other multi-dose vaccine candidates) to get through the trials as quickly as possible, not because they believe that getting it 6 or 7 weeks later will reduce the efficacy boost."
22064,I've been wondering this as well but I don't think anything has been formally said.
22065,The annual flu vaccines get changed every year but I don't think they have to redo it's trials and reapply for approval each year.
22066,But those vaccines have been around for years and are fully licensed.
22067,These vaccines are still new and haven't been fully licensed as only been given emergency approval so i think it may be that it will need to redo the trials.
22068,Pure speculation though.
22069,This guy loves his intense language.

22078,Weird how life was basically normal in the summer then
22079,"Would it be reasonable to assume Sinopharm, with the inactivated virus, has some kind of efficacy towards the new strains that are all over the world, even though it is not targeting that specific virus strain?"
22080,Sorry to hear that
22081,I knew this was Osterholm just from the headline.
22082,"He is way more pessimistic than the vast majority of experts, but somehow he gets all of the media attention."
22083,they have already done so a few days ago
22084,Too bad America is so selfish.
22085,"Canada has got zero vaccines from America and will be waiting months, thanks to Donald Duck banning exports."
22086,Whataboutisms are not going to cut it here.
22087,&gt;No one is suggesting the UK should get less than they ordered from these facilities.
22088,The UK plant cannot produce enough vaccines to maintain the UK’s vaccination rollout *and* make up for the EU’s shortfall.
22089,"So anyone saying that AZ vaccines should be diverted to the EU *is*, in fact, suggesting that the UK should get less than they ordered (or get it much more slowly, which considering their current case numbers, would likely result in the preventable death of thousands more British people)."
22090,&gt;BionTech will not be touched as long as they fulfil their obligations to the EU.
22091,"If by “they” you mean BioNTech, then fair enough - as long as the UK is given enough notice (and enough vaccines) to ensure those who have already received a first dose can receive a second."
22092,"Bhai tu chutiya hai, samjha?"

22107,Seems like a huge percentage of chefs/cooks smoke cigarettes.
22108,Didn’t really seem to be a consideration pre-COVID.
22109,The investigation is a year too late now.
22110,THAT is the problem.
22111,And THAT incriminates the communist party of China.
22112,"Trial data yes, but laboratory data is available to support the delayed vaccination approach."
22113,Individuals with 2-3 month delay in second dose have just as high (in some cases higher) antibody response than those who get it 4 weeks later.
22114,"When combined with the lack of theoretical reason why a delayed dose would be a problem, this is about as clear as it gets without running another full scale trial."
22115,"Keep in mind, *all* multi-dose vaccine candidates selected a 21-28 day window for a second dose."
22116,They did this to run the trials as quickly as possible - longer windows mean more time for results.
22117,It was not picked because they thought it was the optimal window for a second dose - it was the lowest window that they thought wouldn't result in a significantly *reduced* boost effect.
22118,More traditional vaccine trials would have defaulted to a 2 months because that is generally the window for second dose in other vaccines - and is based on data that dosing too soon after initial dose lowers the boost efficacy.
22119,"Wealthy countries (like the US, UK, etc.)"
22120,developed and paid for the vaccines.
22121,They have the right to get access to them first.
22122,"Once everyone in these countries who wants the vaccine gets it, then they will help with vaccination in poorer countries."
22123,We do not need to wait for every country in the world to be vaccinated before we return to normal.
22124,"There are many diseases which cause problems in developing countries (like tuberculosis, malaria, ebola, etc.)"

22132,"Yes, of course."
22133,Everyone seems to have forgotten the air planes arriving from Belgium with all the media filming the vaccines lol
22134,I tested positive for COVID and never lost my taste or smell.

22150,The odds of me getting to go to a concert or an in-country vacation this year just seem to get slimmer and slimmer every day and it’s giving me low grade depression.
22151,I can’t do another year like 2020.
22152,I just can’t.
22153,There likely were mutations to the genome before scientists tested for it.
22154,"A single stranded positive RNA virus mutates at a rate of about 1 in 10,000 or 20,000 per replication."
22155,But most of these do not express many changes in the function of the virus.
22156,"Some are lethal, some neutral, and some advantageous."
22157,But the mutations have been around the entire time.
22158,The media hypes it up now because it’s got a story to run with after the vaccination program has taken effect.
22159,They capitalise on the fact most people never knew about variants before now and use the connotation of the word ‘mutant’ to scare the public into thinking it’s a bigger deal than it actually is.
22160,You mean globally?
22161,Jeez that could be late 2022 if not later.
22162,Unfortunately it's going to be a while for poorer countries to really start mass vaccinations.
22163,"Right now it seems only the developed countries like those in Europe, US, Canada etc will have vaccinated their population."
22164,So the pandemic will only be over in those countries.
22165,HAHAHAHA this gave me such a chuckle!
22166,You’re right!
22167,And how will spreading the vaccine out to 0.5% of each country help?
22168,"In an emergency you make sure you are safe first, you can't help others if you die."
22169,The 1st world can't help the 3rd if they go bankrupt after several years of lockdowns.

22257,"My point is that European countries simply have not put in the hard yards, spent the money, come up with creative solutions, and made the hard decisions with restrictions to properly suppress the virus and it clearly shows."
22258,"I mean at this point it is here, stopping international travel won't prevent the spread."

22339,The original plan was for all British doses to be produced through a supply chain set up by Oxford university and AstraZeneca in the UK.
22340,"The vaccine is manufactured on their behalf by two biotech companies, Oxford BioMedica and Cobra Therapeutics, and filled and finished by Wockhart in Wrexham."

22342,"“That’s why there is a little delay in the delivery of the doses.”

AstraZeneca said it was using a continental bottling facility initially because it had booked capacity there “which we wanted to use rather than waste”, not because of problems at the British sites."
22343,The company and the vaccines task force said they expected UK-made supplies to start flowing smoothly early in the new year.

22360,It’s unfortunate that’s your response.
22361,I thought we were having a good discussion.
22362,"I guess if you can’t beat em with data and logic,  name call!"
22363,Seems to be the go to of most people do online nowadays ....
22364,I sure hope that delaying second dose by 12 weeks doesn't backfire
22365,The faster the rich and connected countries get it the faster everyone else dose.
22366,It might not be the most equitable thing but in the end it's better that they are making it for everyone.
22367,"Yes correct the Ledian manufacturing, opened after the uk switched to bottling in Wrexham rather than Germany"

22369,Sort of a windfall of several variables.
22370,They didn’t have any large wave for their population size until winter meaning less of the pop had preexisting immunity.
22371,"Also, they have a very low icu bed/per 100k population compared to many countries."
22372,"Finally, the Variants probably have a small part as well."
22373,I don’t know if restrictions were relaxed recently as well as I don’t follow that.
22374,Seems most countries will have their own huge waves at some point due to virus being a virus.
22375,"Sucks, but expected."
22376,I bet Johnson &amp; Johnson with two doses will be as effective as Novavax once the results come out.

22378,"OK, so you either don’t understand that article at all, even the first paragraph, or you just have a weak troll game."
22379,"You also didn’t read the article I linked which says:

22391,It doesn't matter how many vaccines we have for Covid.
22392,They won't do us much good sitting on a shelf and not used.
22393,The fact is there is a significant portion of Americans who are refusing the vaccine.
22394,They probably drive that far just for their normal grocery runs and flu shots
22395,Yeah you got some shit you gotta figure out dude that’s all I gotta say lmfao
22396,Did you even read my reply?
22397,Did you even read what your own comment was as some of that doesn't even make sense compared to that.
22398,"You asked why it was wrong for the EU to block vaccines but fine for the UK and USA (not that either of them have really blocked exports, only required prioritisation)."
22399,The reason for that lies with when the made those requirements as this allowed the manufacturers to set up supply chains to deliver vaccines to both of those countries and the rest of the world.
22400,In this case the UK required a dedicated supply until it had been provided 100 million doses.
22401,Therefore AZ set up factories in the UK to do this.
22402,When the EU then signed a contract (3 months later) they then started to set up another supply chain in the EU to deliver those doses.
22403,As a company such as Pfizer already had a supply chain in the EU (and the EU made no such demands) they had no reason to set up a separate supply chain to deliver doses to countries such as the UK.
22404,If the EU had decided it wanted similar prioritisation last summer Pfizer could have investigated other supply chains to meet the needs of the UK and others.
22405,The issue is the EU deciding that it now wants to do this because of it's own mistakes and giving other countries and the manufacturers no time to work around these demands.
22406,Now onto the other point you've suddenly raised.
22407,If you read the AZ/EU contract it only specifies the requirement for AZ's best efforts to meet it's schedule.
22408,As this was intended to be done using it's supply chain within the EU (and funded by the EU) which hit problems (in part due to the short time from the EU signing a contract to expecting deliveries) then AZ have still made best efforts to meet the contract.
22409,"There is no requirement to use factories in the UK (funded by the UK government) until the UK has received it's 100 million does as this would violate the AZ/UK contract and would therefore be far more than expected by ""best efforts""

If you want to reply, please only reply to the first 3 paragraphs."
22410,"I added in the last one to address your points raised, however, I have no intention of replying further about this as it's all up to interpretation and this may well be done by the courts in the future."
22411,If your original point was about this I would never have replied.
22412,Yes.
22413,"If we have evidence that these detainees were involved in a crime, we should charge them and prosecute them."
22414,I don't understand what you find objectionable about this concept.
22415,"Oh no, I care about other people and common human decency."
22416,How self righteous of me /s
22417,"Fun fact, Texas is home to all 4 species of venomous snakes found in the US!"
22418,I mean sure?
22419,"Everything *should* keep going, during snowstorms but they...can't."
22420,"You know even like the military/CIA/NSA have snow days, right?"
22421,"They go down to minimum manning and dig out, just like everyone else."
22422,Why would this be any different?
22423,Snow days aren't some random thing society gives children in school just for funsies.
22424,Does that bother you at all?
22425,I mean I’d honestly be kind of... bothered if I’m social distancing in my country because another country is unvaccinated
22426,"Ok Ms. ""I don't care about disabled people"" go on with your bad self"
22427,"Israeli herd immunity won't be reached until the Palestinians are also vaccinated, the populations mingle too much."
22428,"Regardless of politics, it's pointless persuing herd immunity via a robust vaccination program without sorting Palestine out."
22429,I just hope there is enough to go around and uptake and trust in the vaccine is strong in the Palestinian lands.
22430,We really need these mods to take a hike.
22431,Obstructive and all round a net negative.
22432,Stop interfering.
22433,"So i did make a mistake about that, but i also went back and realized that your projection was late spring and mine was summer."
22434,"You said I was ""goalpost shifting"" when literally I just added an extra month

So you're still an idiot."
22435,Just not for the initial reason
22436,Is that drive thru vaccines i see in the pic?
22437,Aw man lets hope this trends.
22438,So he is now using political theater with travel shutdowns despite international travel being responsible for a small fraction of cases.
22439,He's a total fuck up.
22440,It's working in Germany.
22441,It’s the only one that is a textbook example of what you’re doing
22442,Haha funny wording indeed
22443,It’s been 10 months
22444,[removed]
22445,That’s half the originally set amount 🤨
22446,Or they just don't want to believe it because it's not convenient for them
22447,Lol dude they will be given by someone with medical training...
22448,[removed]
22449,While the US is light years ahead compared to Canada and disclosed their contracts.
22450,We already knew there would be a delay.
22451,Any word on what will be delivered beyond Q1?
22452,Is deliveries still going to be cut?
22453,Fear is useful.
22454,It is after all the body’s way of defending itself.
22455,But its not useful if there is no threat.
22456,im actually laughing at the insane level of self-righteousness you’ve convinced yourself to posess
22457,[removed]
22458,They will pick up as soon as vaccines can be delivered.
22459,Which might be a while since both the US and EU are being protective over their manufacturing currently.
22460,Ok
22461,Umm spoiler alert but this government has done that multiple times already.
22462,Great to see the pace it is being rolled out though regardless of targets
22463,"Is that the only ""woke"" word you know?"
22464,Dumbass
22465,Ok quote where I said that because I simply didn’t say that
22466,classic case of moral virtue signaling
22467,"Look in the mirror, buddy"
22468,Only 15min observation where I got vaxxed.
22469,Contracts that haven't been disclosed to the public.
22470,"Meanwhile, the United States, notorious for it's government transparency, publically disclosed it's contracts."
22471,Sorry i care about people LMAO
22472,"You paid them to start, and they told you at the time it was unlikely you'd get them then."
22473,"And when it panned out that you wouldn't get them, the commission has tried to steal them instead."
22474,"All for a vaccine designed by a foreign university, and distributed at no profit by a foreign company."
22475,"Honestly, I suspect they wished they'd never bothered."
22476,"https://www.welt.de/politik/ausland/article225095715/Astra-Zeneca-CEO-I-do-believe-we-treated-Europe-fairly.html

*Anyway, we didn’t commit with the EU, by the way."
22477,"It’s not a commitment we have to Europe: it’s a best effort, we said we are going to make our best effort."
22478,"The reason why we said that is because Europe at the time wanted to be supplied more or less at the same time as the UK, even though the contract was signed three months later."
22479,"So we said, „Ok, we’re going to do our best, we’re going to try, but we cannot commit contractually because we are three months behind UK“."
22480,"We knew it was a super stretch goal and we know it’s a big issue, this pandemic."
22481,But our contract is not a contractual commitment.
22482,It’s a best effort.
22483,"Basically, we said we’re going to try our best, but we can’t guarantee we’re going to succeed."
22484,"In fact, getting there, we are a little bit delayed."
22485,*
22486,You still want to shrug off social distancing measures NOW.
22487,You just completely changed what you said
22488,"Vaccine approval is dependent on a certain percentage of the placebo group getting infected, so if no cases no vaccine in a sense"
22489,Its not being Superman.
22490,Its having basic common decency.
22491,Sorry you never heard of it
22492,[removed]
22493,I said end of spring and were literally on pace for herd immunity in three months lmfao so critically think here for a second
22494,I’d say July 4th is the point when 99% of things will be back to normal.
22495,We will see things slowly open up until then.
22496,Even then we will probably have 5-10k cases of covid per day until 2022.
22497,I guess people just want to catch Covid and be done with it.
22498,Which uni is that?
22499,And why?
22500,I thought students were last in line
22501,"For all intents and purposes, we do know."
22502,"You are right that there is no direct, tangible evidence in this particular case."
22503,But it would be extraordinarily unusual that the Moderna and Pfizer vaccines are materially negatively impacted by a slightly extended shot window.
22504,"If we weren't in the middle of a pandemic, it would be prudent to wait until the data is there."
22505,But we're not in normal times.
22506,"Science requires evidence, but the value of science is its ability to make predictions."
22507,And keep in mind that evidence is inherently ambiguous in and of itself.
22508,"Depending on the field, evidence is often considered ""confirmed"" at 95% or 99% confidence levels."
22509,1 out of 20 (or 99) times you'd get that just by luck.
22510,The same science that made the blueprint for these vaccines within two days of the Sars-CoV-2 genome being sequenced predicts that a longer window will not harm immune response.
22511,"We should seek to verify (and not make the claim on trust), but it would be absolutely unexpected to have an alternative effect."
22512,I read ‘first pimp’ and my heart filled with patriotic pride.
22513,Britain is once more first pimp.
22514,You know...i remember when Trump suggested using the military.
22515,Everybody stuck their noses up in the air about it.
22516,You're right.
22517,It doesn't make a lick of sense why the spread of COVID in the UK would be slowed by a low vaccination rate in the US.
22518,[deleted]
22519,Same thing happened here in Ireland.
22520,"We were doing quite well handling things, then we opened up over xmas."
22521,Within 2 weeks the UK strain came and ripped through the place like wildfire.
22522,"We went from under 100 to over 8,000 daily cases in  a month."
22523,"I guess due to proximity we were the first to feel it, other countries may be experiencing this surge now."
22524,How do you know that?
22525,Do you know every single covid case ever and how those people turned out?
22526,Shut up
22527,Haha makes sense.
22528,Freaked out that I had missed some news and we were all screwed.
22529,[deleted]
22530,No clue tbh.
22531,I'm still wondering where they've been able to get the extra 9m doses from.
22532,Either they're diverting a small amount of doses from other plants or there's better yielding at their Belgium plant than expected.
22533,Also says they're expanding the Belgium plant capacity.
22534,Depending how long that takes it may mean they could increase the amount for Q1 again.
22535,Most people around here prefer Fauci's delivery.
22536,But there's a large segment of the population who only hear things wrapped in fear.
22537,Better they get info from him than a guy like Limbaugh.
22538,"affect*, please define the word ""vaccine""."
22539,None of them were infected by me eating outdoors
22540,Scared me there for a second haha.
22541,Thought I had missed some news.
22542,Yet somehow the UK vaccine task force said it won't come from a domestic supply chain.
22543,"So either provide a citation, or stop sharing false information."
22544,https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-health-coronavirus-britain-astrazenec/uks-initial-astrazeneca-shots-will-come-from-europe-taskforce-says-idUKKBN28I1NH
22545,Not when it’s a couple of days and then back to normal life.
22546,"Get stuff done around the house, spend time with family, binge on some Netflix, then back to normal."
22547,"In terms of places where the police may aggressively break up crowds, this is one of them."
22548,These vaccine drives are essential
22549,"Depends on if you say you’ve had allergic reactions before, or have particular conditions."
22550,"I wasn’t even asked about my medical record, actually, but obviously if I had a history of reactions I would have spoken up."
22551,"They wrote the time that I could leave the observation area on my windshield, and the 15 min and 30 min people were in different lines."
22552,Harm reduction is a core tenet of public health.
22553,Why it’s been seemingly forgotten is beyond me.
22554,You have the pull the splinter out of your own eye before you pull the log out of somebody else’s.
22555,Although if you say we can have our lives back by summer you can totally take my dose and give it to somebody else.
22556,No problem.
22557,[removed]
22558,Do the monkey with me
22559,Pandemics “end” as in they stop really having an impact on people’s lives much quicker.
22560,They only technically are declared as over much later.
22561,&gt;And how will spreading the vaccine out to 0.5% of each country help?
22562,We can target those most vulnerable to death worldwide instead of just in rich countries.
22563,"Most deaths come from a subset of demographics (notably, age)."
22564,"If we target those people, we can drastically reduce mortality in a very short period of time."
22565,"&gt;In an emergency you make sure you are safe first, you can't help others if you die."
22566,The 1st world can't help the 3rd if they go bankrupt after several years of lockdowns.
22567,"All the top countries have earmarked hundreds of millions of vaccines for poorer nations, but those vaccines don't exist yet and wont unless our indsutries can work with less restriction."
22568,What vaccine production has been slowed because of lockdowns?
22569,I don't see how open bars and restaurants will help Jonson and Johnson ramp up production
22570,International travel is responsible for every case in Canada.
22571,It's not like it just spontaneously appeared in every country in the world.
22572,They're trying to prevent things from spiraling out of control again.
22573,So everything will be back to normal for good?
22574,No more testing etc... don’t pandemics normally last longer than 1 year for the virus to be completely gone?
22575,I can't wait.
22576,My doctor said I'd probably be waiting until the fall.
22577,It seems like you’re taking as a personal criticism and it absolutely isn’t meant that way.
22578,It was meant as a criticism towards the entire approach.
22579,If we focused our efforts on beefing up staff at these stores we could use all of them to vaccinate instead of just a few.
22580,I always dislike how profit is shared in America as it doesn’t often go to those doing the job and I think that’s a travesty.
22581,"Keep doing the good work, we do appreciate it."
22582,Are you??
22583,I sleep plenty considering I'm doing fuck all.
22584,So much for travel bubbles?
22585,Yh such a shady company thst they are selling the vaccine at cost for the duration of the pandemic whilst the other vaccines are being sold for profit.
22586,But yh let's all go after AZ
22587,ARREST THEM THEN
22588,So the virus will be completely gone by summer?
22589,I thought pandemics normally last 4 years?
22590,The UK developed a vaccine and licensed it out (at cost) all over the world.
22591,"In hindsight, given that the rest of the world thinks we're pure evil in any case, we should have made as much profit as we could."
22592,The US is at 1.3 million per day.
22593,"Amazon has been a massive help in the UK Covid testing program, helping to deliver testing kits very quickly."
22594,Im sure they will help with other areas of called upon.
22595,Do you think it’ll go up in the next weeks?
22596,Right?
22597,It's so refreshing to be thrown off like this
22598,Also live in LA.
22599,"They both have very moderate climates and don’t reach anything even close to the northeast, Midwest etc and are much closer to each other than they are anything else"
22600,Are you ok dude?
22601,Maybe sleep a little?
22602,Taking one dose for himself wouldn’t be a big deal considering they are making millions of doses.
22603,What people in this forum don’t understand is that having a “happy and free” summer has absolutely nothing to do with the virus and everything to do with government restrictions.
22604,"I suspect that regardless of vaccine efficacy, people will be tired of mindlessly complying by the summertime, so people will be living freely no matter what."
22605,"Don't worry I'm not weak minded I have the perseverance and mental fortitude to do what it takes to be part of the solution and when this is over I'll know that I wasn't one of the narcissists that couldn't set aside their wants and helped perpetuate the spread causing more mutations and more deaths, I'm perfectly fine with that."
22606,Just look at history and see the suffering ppl had to endure during the world wars and great depression and here we are with all the comforts we could ask for and everything at our fingertips to be delivered to our doors and all you have to do is set aside your wants for a couple of years to protect the lives of the ppl who suffered far worse than relaxing at home to give you your comfy want filled life and you can't handle that..pathetic.
22607,Well June was when everyone endorsed massive protests so yeah I'd say June is when everyone gave up.
22608,It was a big gamble but thankfully it paid off
22609,Germany's done a bang up job
22610,"Thanks, couldn't find anything about a national lockdown, but must have missed the coordinated local ones."
22611,It also increases the risk of escape mutations.
22612,"And it only works, if your supply is at least stable, since you definately shouldn't go above the 6 weeks between first and second dosis."
22613,Therefore this strategy is a lot riskier.
22614,"The benefits might outweight the risk, but its not like its the go-to solution."
22615,"Especially now, where we hear about production problems from Biontech and AstraZeneca on a weekly basis."
22616,Doubt it will be worst than the holiday season.
22617,Bit rich coming from you haha.
22618,Only pro-EU agendas are allowed here.
22619,You mean the Oxford/AZ vaccine where the UK invested in setting up domestic production lines very early?
22620,The ones where any surplus from these is going to be given away to poorer nations?
22621,The same vaccine that is being produced at cost in multiple countries around the world?
22622,That is being given to poorer countries.
22623,The UK that has donated over $700m to COVAX and billions into GAVI?
22624,Yep vaccine nationalisation right there
22625,Oxford and J&amp;J should be approved in Canada by the end of February.
22626,But Canada won't be receiving any doses in Q1 so there is no rush.
22627,Honest question and something that I have been trying to find out is when Novavax will be approved.
22628,Don't you think their phase 3 clinical trial in UK was a little small (15K) relative to others (Moderna/Pfizer 40K participants)?
22629,Do you think Canada will wait for their phase 3 clinical trial in Mexico/US (30K) to be over before approving?
22630,We haven't even gotten any documents from Novavax.
22631,According to how long we know phase 3 trials take the Novavax US/Mexico trial should be over at the end of April and approved in May.
22632,That is what I am expecting unless you know something new (and please tell me if you do).
22633,Canada has said that it expects 20M doses in Q2 from Pfizer and Moderna.
22634,If other vaccines are approved (Oxford/J&amp;J/Novavax) we expect an additional 20M doses from them.
22635,No timetables or guarantees have been stated as far as I know.
22636,"&gt; The contract states that the orders don't have to come from any specific place, 

Actually, the EU/AstraZeneca contract specifically mentions 4 production sites, 2 in the EU and 2 in the UK, from which the vaccines are to be supplied."
22637,"I went to go pick up KFC for lunch, and while I was getting my food, I noticed a booth full of old ladies just hanging out there

Imagine risking your life to go eat inside a KFC lol"
22638,Wait wasn't he vaccinated?
22639,You're turning something into left v. right that really isn't political in that way.
22640,"You're correct, West Virginia turned down the Walgreens/CVS deal, but only because those large, national retailers don't have many locations in WV like they do in other states."
22641,So the only difference here is that the state government of WV is working with a network of smaller chains and independent pharmacies rather than with the two big boys.
22642,It has absolutely nothing to do with public-private v. state run vaccinations.
22643,"Ah yeah the EU shafted itself by purchasing vaccines months after places like the UK and the US, but places that ordered on time like the UK and Israel are doing much better"
22644,My logic?
22645,Are you illiterate?
22646,"I specifically stated that I was not offering an opinion, but merely presenting what_was_possible."
22647,It is POSSIBLE to avoid the scenario you presented by vaccinating the guards.
22648,Full stop.
22649,That FACT has nothing at all to do with how I personally FEEL about it.
22650,"Fucking duh, dude."
22651,Because those who are able to drive will be much more motivated to do so when they face a higher risk of infection as in a place with low mask wearing.
22652,Doesn't it make sense for countries that develop the vaccines and have the funds first ensure their own population is taken care of first?
22653,You can't help others until you first help yourself.
