29,The west just cannot believe this because the media portrays it so different.
30,They wouldn't want china to look good...
31,I'm jealous
32,"Not herd immunity, no."
33,Not with Delta.
34,&gt;	Time to move on.
35,"Yeah, but boosters should also be gotten."
36,People commenting on this type of post have been mentioning that it‚Äôs always the 2nd dose that knocked them off their feet.

39,I‚Äôll start by saying she‚Äôs very educated (masters) and in a medical field - just like me.
40,So makes it all the more baffling.
41,The misinformation is just so crazy!!
42,She‚Äôs full on the government conspiracy train.
43,Thinks the vaccine is terrible and has killed people and the government isn‚Äôt telling us.
44,Thinks she won‚Äôt be able to get pregnant or it will cause birth defects.
45,Tells me to watch dopesick to open my eyes about big pharma and how they‚Äôre just out to make money.

48,‚ÄúEnforcement‚Äù‚Ä¶ yeah that‚Äôs inaccurate.
49,They didn‚Äôt ask to see my ID.
50,Just my vaccine card and verified it wasn‚Äôt fake with the state database.
51,"My office went WFH on Thursday (the 12th or 19th, unsure) when things started getting bad and it is insane how lucky we are we did that."
52,"A few of us were still going in for a few days, and on Friday my coworker's partner came to pick them up and came into the office for a few minutes."
53,"A week later he started displaying symptoms and had a very bad case, but luckily survived and is doing very well now."
54,He had contracted it a few days before he came into our office.
55,If we hadn't done the WFH thing we would have been doing a standard Friday happy hour with \~100 people in our main area just hanging out and drinking beer.
56,Still can't believe how close we came to massive outbreak.
57,I would say at least it's a lot better though.
58,Per population percentage of people infected per day in US is 0.00027 and Australia at 200 a day would be about 0.000008% infected a day.
59,That may not look like it but that's a massive difference.
60,Zero may not be achievable but still great numbers!
61,"Yeah, if the rest of the world did lockdowns like that we would have been killing it."

63,"Israel pulled it off recently, at least with zero deaths."
64,"Eastern Europe is getting hit hardest, and it's not a very rich region (especially when you look outside of the big cities)."
65,"That being said, for a lot of countries in the region, the problem is as much to do with the legacy of communism, which has left the populations extremely suspicious of authority and vulnerable to anti vax rhetoric."
66,No one expects them to be consistent.
67,You mean there's still morals after two years of this?
68,üòù
69,The fact PA is one of the 13 original colonies already eliminates it from being a mid-west state.
70,"The mid-west largely consists of states/colonies that were founded as the US expanded its land, as part of sort of a frontier."
71,Also I‚Äôm not sure what you are getting at with your cultural argument.
72,"You seem to imply that since PA has industrial cities like Pittsburgh and Erie that it culturally fits the mid-west, yet there are mid west states like Nebraska and Iowa that don‚Äôt have such cities but are still considered in the mid-west."
73,Also Trenton NJ is another industrial city that is considered a rust belt yet I doubt you would consider NJ as a mid-western state.
74,"I live in Philadelphia, and I‚Äôve been to many places across this state."
75,"No one here considers PA a midwestern state, the US census doesn‚Äôt consider PA as a mid-western state, and I‚Äôm pretty sure nearly everyone in the mid-west doesn‚Äôt consider PA as a mid-western state."
76,"If you were from PA and claimed to be from the mid-west, people would either be confused or laugh at you."
77,"Sorry for the long comment, but PA is not a mid-western state geographically or culturally."
78,I've actually found it really hard to find a booster shot for myself and I live in a red area.
79,I should have gotten it weeks ago at least but I'm a dumb dumb
80,&gt;Never again do I want March of 2020 to happen again.
81,***Again***?

83,"I appreciate you having integrity, I also did what I was supposed to do the first go around."
84,This time for the booster I didn't because there was no supply/demand issues.
85,"One thing this has taught me, look out for you and your family."
86,"Nobody else seems to give a damn, and waiting around for proper authorities to give the go ahead can be quite frustrating."
87,Exercise does that.
88,"In Alberta, they haven't opened the floodgates for eligibility yet for a booster."
89,Got my second shot June 26.
90,Leaving for an international trip (for 3 weeks) and Im guessing will be close to eligible when we return.
91,Anyone know how exacting they are about the booster?
92,is it 6 months to the day or 6-months...ish?

96,Until when?
97,90% of Irish adults of vaccinated.
98,Everyone who's not either doesn't want it or aren't medically able to get it and none of them can go to pubs.
99,The virus isn't going away.
100,Are they going to lock down the country every few months for the rest of time to save a couple dozen people's lives?
101,You spread it to your family.
102,How they doing?
103,Yeah except that wouldn't be necessary.
104,New Zealand for example locked down hard and heavy all borders.
105,Then kicked down hard.
106,Then they were able to enjoy fairly normal life with the exception of masks and some distancing.
107,They were able to enjoy many luxuries inside their country they normally would unlike the US because the spread was everywhere.
108,You pointed out it started in China.
109,Much harder to contain something where it starts no?
110,"That's where preventative measures and fast acting would have saved the day... 

Yeah it's great we have our freedom."
111,"Yet, our freedom killed tons of loved ones and disabled many others."
112,A year and half to get a vaccine would not have been much to ask in the grand scheme of things.
113,Everyone pretends the way we went about it saved our economy...
114,"However, if we controlled it we could have been supporting all our business like our restrauants much more."
115,"Instead we had to shut them down, then bring them back online, then shut them down, then give them subsides... Plus, all the people that got sick cost tons of money and will for the foreseeable future."
116,I am 25 and was working for the government full time in a highly educated position.
117,Now I'm disabled and unable to work with the government paying for me to live.
118,"My medicine costs minimum $100,000 a year."
119,This will be the rest of my life.
120,There are many people like me that survived and now it will cost the nation the rest of our lives.
121,"That's minimum $6,000,000 just for me... And I hate it."
122,"Now, think of all the other people like me."
123,We wouldn't even have to worry about imprisonment if people just made small sacrifices to help others like wearing their face mask...
124,Many of the countries that succeeded think like that.
125,Same for me.
126,Booked an appointment thinking I'll get third dose of Moderna.
127,"They only had pfizer, so got that."
128,Mild fever and sore arm.
129,"Yes, but apparently not as big as some countries."
130,"Our studies found that Pfizer effectiveness dropped to about 67% after six months, whereas it might drop to as low as [47%](https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/pfizerbiontech-covid-19-vaccine-effectiveness-drops-after-6-months-study-2021-10-04/) in the US."

136,"For comparison, Pfizer and Moderna recipients usually have readings of over 1,000, or at least in the hundreds, after five months."
137,"It was a good idea in concept, but J&amp;J is awful."
138,75% of the Irish are vaccinated which I assume means virtually all adults.
139,Isn't that herd immunity?
140,Even if it isn't where does this end?
141,It's never going away.
142,If you're still worried just stay home and let everyone else roll the dice.
143,I'm so glad my government isn't doing this bullshit anymore.
144,We have a vaccine and everyone who is vulnerable has had the chance to get it.
145,Time to move on.
146,It also gives them the option of hiding their displeasure and making mean faces at customers who annoy them.
147,Winter.
148,The uptick occured around the same time last year.
149,There's still many people who have never been vaccinated or caught the virus yet so it's hitting them now.
150,"Judging by the pattern, it'll probably be January or February before cases go down."
151,Exactly!
152,I didn‚Äôt wait and got my booster anyway but this is a colossal fuckup.
153,No one knows what they‚Äôre doing and they never should have waited this long.

332,"And they've done well containing after the fact, but this is far from over."
333,"The new variants have proved to be much more contagious, it's just a matter of time before it affects them like it has most other countries."
334,"So if your measure of success is ""How have you done between April 2020 and November 2021"", then yeah they did great."
335,"Unless you had covid again later you can check for antibodies - there are tests which don't detect the vaccines, only past infection."
336,Yep.
337,Had two moderna shots back in Jan/Feb and got Pfizer a few weeks ago.
338,Honestly I would be surprised if nursing home staff didn't suffer from PTSD even before covid.

346,"You realize the reason everyone can't have a piece of the vaccine pie is because most of it has been taken by the global North, right?"
347,What the WHO is advocating for is literally everyone getting a piece of the pie.
348,Having a vaccinated global north with boosters every (x) number of months and a massive un-vaccinated population in the global south will risk a much worse variant than Delta.
349,You can get a Pfizer or Moderna shot (1-only) as your booster.
350,Can you get an appointment in Hawaii?
351,Three days won't make a difference.
352,"Let's say the third dose tapers off at double current immunity which would be really good, so 50% instead of 20-30%."
353,That would mean the R0 reduces from 6.5 to 5 which is not a lot.
354,"Any chance of stopping exponential growth of delta through vaccine herd immunity would mean requiring above 90% vaccine immunity, which might mean a shot every two three months forever?"

362,We're making 1.5 billion doses a month.
363,We're on pace to have over 20 billion total doses by the end of the year.
364,We *have* to get first doses out to everyone willing to take them.
365,"But this isn't just a supply issue, even though we completely failed by not having 2  billion doses of monthly manufacturing ready a year ago."
366,We're *still* wasting doses by giving second doses to old people before young people get their first dose.
367,We're letting doses go bad and be thrown away.
368,We're letting funding and logistics hold us back - worldwide dose usage has dropped 1/3 from its peak (per ourworldindata) even though manufacturing continues to rise every month.
369,There's no easy answer.
370,We *all* need three doses.
371,"Ya, it's necessary for us anyway but might be helpful for covid."
372,Definitely the vaccines are responsible for the fact that my infected employee did not spread out to anyone else.
373,But we also had zero cases in the pre vaccine era.
374,And our environment is pretty high risk.
375,No such thing as *perfect* compliance even with everyone being careful.
376,Or maybe we just got really lucky.
377,We'll never really know.
378,I have good employees.
379,All of this has been a complete non issue.

408,"Instead, and that made matters worse by a lot, we ended up with the Bundestag castrating itself willingly for fear of being put in a situation where balls absolutely would be required, and decision and policy-making in the hands of the Ministerpr√§sidentenkonferenz, a political entity where not being able to get over the need for political posturing is baked into the very structure - there's always some election going on somewhere, so there's always the need for some dimwit to be seen to 'stand up for his constituency' slowing down proceedings to a crawl."
409,"Alright, in less polemic words, that's probably intended as a safeguard against rash decisions, but that doesn't make it in any way less obvious how ridiculously unfit for purpose the whole setup is for the task at hand."

466,Fun fact: maybe if they didn't open their mouths when COVID was losing force then we could have hanged onto the NPIs a little longer and they wouldn't experience their fourth wave.
467,It is not the first time the WHO messes it up.
468,"Back in January/February they stated that cases were dropping for the first time in months, which caused people to loosen restrictions prematurely and then Delta hit and cases rose up again."
469,"Then they were falling again and after two months they decide to state the obvious, which again caused people to relax measures very quickly and they are experiencing another wave, fourth wave."

642,Given our track record you can't even blame anyone for that.
643,"&gt;Nearly 10 percent of children ages 5 to 11 have received their first coronavirus vaccine dose, just two weeks into the immunization campaign for the 28 million young Americans in that age group, Jeff Zients, the White House‚Äôs coronavirus coordinator, said on Wednesday."
644,"&gt;That represents a faster uptake than when adults were initially offered coronavirus vaccine shots about a year ago, he added."
645,"‚ÄúFor perspective, it took about 50 days for us to reach 10 percent of adults with one shot,‚Äù he said."
646,"&gt;There are at least eight times as many adults as there are kids in the 5-11 age group, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention."
647,"&gt;Zients, speaking to reporters alongside the nation‚Äôs top infectious-disease expert, Anthony S. Fauci, and CDC Director Rochelle Walensky, said that since injections began this month for kids younger than 12, about 2.6 million of them had received their first shot."
648,"&gt;‚ÄúIn fact, the pace of vaccinations for kids has been accelerating."
649,"In the last week, 1.7 million kids got vaccinated ‚Äî double the prior week,‚Äù Zients said."
650,&gt;Zients also said that about 80 percent of Americans age 12 or older had received at least one shot of a coronavirus vaccine and 31 million people had been injected with boosters.
651,"‚ÄúThere‚Äôs more work to do, but these milestones represent critical progress,‚Äù he said."
652,&gt;The positive developments that the White House sought to highlight coincided with grimmer news.
653,"New cases, hospitalizations and deaths were increasing in some colder states, though the nation as a whole was seeing covid-19 fatalities decline, Washington Post figures show."
654,"More than 763,000 Americans have died of covid-19 since the start of the pandemic."
655,"&gt;And although more Americans have been getting vaccinated, logistical problems have frustrated parents trying to immunize their kids (in one New York City vaccination site, for instance, parents reportedly waited six hours to get their children vaccine jabs), while confusion over who qualifies for boosters has disrupted administrations of the extra shots in some states."
656,&gt;Zients didn‚Äôt directly address specific problems.
657,"But he told reporters that vaccine shots for young children are now available at 30,000 locations, up from 20,000 the prior week."

700,"**Why did Japan‚Äôs fifth and biggest wave of the coronavirus pandemic, driven by the supercontagious delta variant, suddenly come to an abrupt end following a seemingly relentless rise in new infections?"
701,And what made Japan different from other developed countries that are now seeing a fresh surge in new cases?
702,"**  
According to one group of researchers, the surprising answer may be that the delta variant took care of itself in an act of ‚Äúself-extinction.‚Äù  
Three months after the delta variant spurred record daily nationwide caseloads of nearly 26,000, new COVID-19 infections in Japan have plummeted, dropping below 200 in recent weeks."
703,Highlighting that drop was the fact that no deaths were reported on Nov. 7 ‚Äî the first time that had happened in about 15 months.
704,"Many scholars point to a variety of possibilities, which include one of the highest vaccination rates among advanced countries with 75.7% of residents fully vaccinated as of Wednesday."
705,Other potential factors are the social distancing and mask-wearing measures that are now deeply embedded in Japanese society.
706,"But the chief reason may be related to the genetic changes that the coronavirus undergoes during reproduction, at a pace of around two mutations per month."
707,"According to a potentially revolutionary theory proposed by Ituro Inoue, a professor at the National Institute of Genetics, the delta variant in Japan accumulated too many mutations to the virus‚Äôs error-correcting, non-structural protein called nsp14."
708,"As a result, the virus struggled to repair the errors in time, ultimately leading to ‚Äúself-destruction.‚Äù  
Studies have shown that more people in Asia have a defense enzyme called APOBEC3A that attacks RNA viruses, including the SARS-CoV-2 virus that causes COVID-19, when compared to people in Europe and Africa."
709,So the researchers from the National Institute of Genetics and Niigata University set out to discover how the APOBEC3A protein affects the nsp14 protein and whether it can inhibit the activity of the coronavirus.
710,The team conducted an analysis of the genetic diversity data for the alpha and delta variants from infected clinical specimens in Japan from June to October.
711,They then visualized the relationships among the DNA sequences of the SARS-CoV-2 virus to show genetic diversity in a diagram called a haplotype network.
712,"In general, the bigger the network is, the more positive cases it represents  
The network of the alpha variant, which was the main driver for Japan‚Äôs fourth wave from March to June, had five major groups with many mutations branching out, confirming a high level of genetic diversity."
713,"The researchers thought the delta variant, which the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says is more than twice as contagious as previous variants and might cause more severe illness in unvaccinated people, would have a far more vibrant genetic diversity."
714,"Surprisingly, they found the opposite to be true."
715,The haplotype network had only two major groups and the mutations seemed to come to a sudden stop in the middle of its evolutionary development process.
716,"When the researchers went on to examine the virus‚Äôs error-correcting enzyme nsp14, they discovered that the vast majority of nsp14 specimens in Japan seemed to have undergone many genetic changes in mutation sites called A394V."
717,"‚ÄúWe were literally shocked to see the findings,‚Äù Inoue told The Japan Times."
718,‚ÄúThe delta variant in Japan was highly transmissible and keeping other variants out.
719,"But as the mutations piled up, we believe it eventually became a faulty virus and it was unable to make copies of itself."
720,"Considering that the cases haven‚Äôt been increasing, we think that at some point during such mutations it headed straight toward its natural extinction.‚Äù  
Inoue‚Äôs theory, while innovative, would lend support to the mysterious disappearance of the delta variant‚Äôs spread in Japan."
721,"While much of the rest of the world with similarly high vaccination rates, including South Korea and some Western countries, are suffering from record waves of new infections, Japan appears to be a peculiar case in that COVID-19 cases have remained subdued despite trains and restaurants filling up following the end of the most recent state of emergency."
722,"‚ÄúIf the virus were alive and well, cases for sure would increase as masking and vaccination do not prevent breakthrough infections in some cases,‚Äù Inoue said."
723,"Indeed, the unexpected plunge in new cases following the summer wave has been a hot topic of discussion among many experts, including those not conducting studies on the coronavirus, according to Takeshi Urano, a professor at Shimane University‚Äôs Faculty of Medicine who was not involved in the research led by Inoue."
724,"‚ÄúNsp14 works with other virus proteins and has a critical function to protect the virus RNA from breaking apart,‚Äù he said when asked about Inoue‚Äôs findings."
725,"‚ÄúStudies have shown that a virus with a crippled nsp14 has a significantly reduced ability to replicate, so this can be one factor behind the rapid decline in new cases."
726,"The nsp14 is virus-derived, and the chemical agent to curb this protein could become a promising medicine, with development already underway.‚Äù  
Japan seems to be an anomaly in that the delta variant was virtually shutting out alpha and other variants by late August."
727,"On the other hand, other countries ‚Äî including India and Indonesia, both of which were hit particularly hard by the delta variant ‚Äî have reported a mix of alpha and delta strains among cases."
728,"A similar natural extinction of the coronavirus could possibly be observed overseas, Inoue says, adding that detecting that would be difficult as no other country seems to have accumulated as many mutations in the virus‚Äôs nsp14 as in Japan, though similar mutations at the A394V site have been discovered in at least 24 countries."
729,But Inoue‚Äôs theory may also help explain why the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) ended abruptly in 2003.
730,An in vitro experiment in which the researchers caused mutations in nsp14 in the virus that causes SARS led to findings that the virus eventually could not replicate itself as mutations piled up.
731,"‚ÄúNo genome data exists, so it‚Äôs just a hypothesis, but because it has disappeared, it will never see the light of day again,‚Äù he said."
732,So what are the chances that we could see a similar natural extinction overseas of the COVID-19-causing SARS-CoV-2 virus?
733,"‚ÄúThe chances are not zero, but that seems too optimistic for now as we‚Äôre unable to get hold of any such evidence, though we have looked at various data of other countries,‚Äù he said."
734,"Since peaking in mid-August, daily COVID-19 cases in Japan continued a downward slide to fall below 5,000 by mid-September and under 200 by late October."
735,"The country has been enjoying one of the lowest infection rates of any advanced country for some time, but it‚Äôs not immune to the next wave of the pandemic, Inoue says."
736,"‚ÄúThere‚Äôs clearly a threat,‚Äù he said."
737,‚ÄúWe have been all right because there was a delta variant.
738,Other variants sneaked in little by little but Japan‚Äôs delta was keeping them away.
739,"But because there‚Äôs nothing now to keep them at bay, there‚Äôs room for new ones to enter as the vaccines alone would not solve the problem."
740,"In that sense, I think the quarantine measures for immigration control are very important because we never know what comes in from foreign countries.‚Äù  
Some people may wonder if the self-extinction of the delta variant in Japan was caused by something special in the genetic make-up of Japanese people, but Inoue disagrees."
741,"‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think so,‚Äù he said."
742,"‚ÄúPeople in East Asia, such as Koreans, are ethnically the same as Japanese."
743,"But I don‚Äôt know why this observation was made in Japan.‚Äù  
Inoue said that the team of researchers at the National Institute of Genetics and Niigata University plan to compile a study on their findings by the end of November."
744,Not really sure why the author included despite in the title.
745,Deaths are a lagging indicator.

755,"in theory, yes, but the circulation of the virus in 1st world countries (&amp; Germany just posted its highest hospitalization numbers since the early pandemic) still poses a global risk because the continued spread of virus still creates conditions for new variants."

759,I'm sure Biden was also aware of that retarding booster rollout for reasons of helping other countries was a political nonstarter.
760,"I sent Biden an online comment (using the helpful feedback mechanism at the whitehouse web site) that boosters should be made widely available to everyone, and I have no doubt there was much feedback of that kind."
761,I think what the FDA/CDC leadership need to give their advisory committees is instructions on how to separate technical and political considerations in their recommendations.
762,Politics can't be ignored -- the values that inform what the goals are are political things -- but it can be made explicit.
763,I think most politicians and judges agree that states have the authority to introduce vaccine mandates; the question is if the Federal Government can do the same through OSHA.

771,"I'm sure it was fine, I didn't feel much either!"
772,Has anyone else gotten a booster after only 4 months?
773,I live in Germany and we're having by far our worst outbreak of the pandemic with a lot of breakthrough cases.
774,"They recently said anyone can go and get a booster shot, at least in my state."
775,A lot of fully vaccinated people are also getting COVID (although the rates are obviously lower than the unvaxxed).
776,I was vaccinated with my second dose 4 months ago.
777,"Technically I am allowed to get a booster but most advice says wait 6 months, is there a reason why I should wait another 2 months?"
778,"It is not hard to get an appointment, actually I am getting vaccinated by a mobile team at my workplace, so it's not like I'm stealing an appointment from an elderly person who got vaccinated 8 months ago."
779,"If you're not here, raise your hand."
780,This is a bit different.
781,The questions in the Maine case are much different then in this one.
782,"The question that is being asked is whether Congress gave OSHA the authority to do something like this when they were created, which I‚Äôm not sure how the SC will rule."
783,It‚Äôs still up in the air.
784,This could be great for my grandparents who are in their 90s.

950,No vaccine that I know of protects you from something 100%.
951,"Additionally, almost every vaccine requires boosters."
952,Having a vaccine that requires 2 shots to get to 95% protection against death and 3 shots to get to 95% protection against infection give or take seems pretty standard to me.
953,This is of course 100% correct.
954,We need to encourage people to get boosters not discourage them.

958,"Well, yes, that's true."
959,And those who pollute intentionally and deliberately (e.g.
960,rolling coal) are much more culpable than others.
961,The same as people who don't lock themselves in completely (i.e.
962,"basically all of us) to some extent contribute to the ongoing pandemic, but those who don't get vaccinated are going above and beyond and are actively (and completely unnecessarily) endangering others."

1033,what you said here has no bearing to that point; it actually contradicts it so thank you for making my point.
1034,\&gt; doesn't mean that endemic phase presents an acceptable level of risk to avoid quarantining and other affronts to 'normal life'.
1035,Acceptable to whom?
1036,"Maybe you personally want to see absolute zero risk, which is fine if that‚Äôs your personal preference."
1037,"But for many government and many people, being fully vaxxed (which could include a booster dose at some point) represents a very reasonable safety level."
1038,"In highly vaccinated areas, it‚Äôs now mostly a pandemic of the unvaccinated."
1039,The vaccinated population shares a tiny fraction of case load.
1040,"I‚Äôm not saying you should personally accept this risk assessment, just that lots of people feel that way."
1041,"If you personally want to minimize risk, you certainly can, by wearing a mask on top of getting vaccinated."

1071,It has also stripped away a lot of my hope that there was a majority of people who had some semblance of decency.
1072,It now appears it‚Äôs a minority and the majority is out for themselves and everyone else can die if it means their lives are inconvenient
1073,"&gt;Of course we still have to mask indoors in public

Are you in a particularly high spread area?"
1074,"For the like 8000th time, deaths are the wrong metric."
1075,Hospitalizations are the big problem.
1076,"We could save every single COVID patient, nobody could be dying, and the hospitals could still be overrun with COVID patients, and the standard of care could drop across the board."
1077,I agree that the messaging has been awful and that boosters should have been admitted as necessary earlier.
1078,I just don‚Äôt see how a person who went and got a booster feels taken for a ride as the government says he made the right call and his choice is beneficial.
1079,"Like, they‚Äôre agreeing with what you did."
1080,You made the right call.
1081,Being taken for a ride would be if you went and got a booster and then it came out that boosters did nothing and you actually got saline in your arm.
1082,"The wise thing is a ""80% vaccinated means no masks"" deal."
1083,Several States have done this successfully without outbreaks

1085,Not even as many as polling indicated would (around 25%).
1086,Well supply is still an issue in a lot of places.
1087,I think we'll see the 25% number pretty soon and then a steady drop off in vaccine rates for this age.
1088,"Similar to 12-17 year olds, they got the first 25% in a month then it took 3 more months to get the second 25%."
1089,Then stop talking masking down.
1090,Why would you trash something you find sensible yourself?

1107,"Assuming few of the ICU cases are from ineligible children, that's a 13.5 fold higher risk ((6/10)/(4/90)) of critical cases among the unvaccinated."
1108,"That's pretty reasonable for a whole population, in other countries vaccination offers better than 20 fold lower risk in younger adults, but the benefit is more modest, maybe 5-7 fold, in the elderly who are also intrinsically more likely to require critical care if infected."

1160,Right now is merely a snapshot in time.
1161,You would have been saying the opposite if you looked at the map in September 2021.
1162,The south mostly already went through its huge delta wave while the midwest and northeast did not.
1163,"Now we're reversing - my amateur guess here is that the cold weather is playing a part in more northern states, forcing people more indoors."
1164,The weather in the south has been more mild by comparison.
1165,"&gt;Yes, but a lot of folks ***felt*** we'd always need boosters

&amp;#x200B;

The thing is, despite having the right ***feeling*** to what was going to happen, without actual data to back that up, it would be irresponsible for the CDC to make that claim and they'd be criticized for making an unfounded claim regardless, much like they're getting criticized for ***not*** making that unfounded claim back then right now."
1166,"IIRC, what they actually said was, ""at this time we don't feel that boosters will be necessary"", but that was of course before Delta popped up in India, spread around the world, and changed the game entirely."
1167,That was before re-infection was even thought possible because there wasn't enough evidence that it was occurring at significant enough levels to raise concern.
1168,"The virus sets the pace here, and the researchers and scientists are doing the best that they can."
1169,"In my state, I also need comorbidities."
1170,"I want my booster shot, thank you."
1171,But I can't get it :|
1172,Now if they can just approve under 5 I can safer for the already limited interactions my kids get.

1179,Thank you and congrats!
1180,You are good people.
1181,It's all about the image because of tourism.
1182,Why do people always use the example of thalidomide.
1183,The thalidomide babies that were born were a result of mothers taking a drug that *wasn't* approved for morning sickness.
1184,"That's an example of the FDA actually doing it's job, and should inspire confidence in the organization"
1185,I got Pfizer and pflu at the same time.
1186,The flu arm felt worse afterward.
1187,"You have ""super immunity."""
1188,You're fine.
1189,"There are still studies being done on mixing and matching and protection, but boosting farther out is better than boosting sooner to your original dose."
1190,"No signs (yet) of people having ""serious complications"" just because they went J&amp;J -&gt; Moderna."
1191,The article seems to be a mish-mash of different data and writing that seems to conflate things together.
1192,Any evidence of waning of immunity against seriously disease seems to be confined to the elderly and long term care facilities.
1193,"There's some evidence that boosters also additionally reduce hospitalizations over 2-shots in people over-40, but they don't claim to see any waning there, they just claim that its even better."
1194,Then they speculate that it'd be good for younger people to get boosted since it will probably be more protective but concede its difficult to see those in the numbers.
1195,Hospitalizations of unvaccinated people are also of course rising where cases and hospitalizations are rising.
1196,There's no mention of what categories those people are in or the proportion.
1197,"I don't think there's anything false in this article, but its a hot mess of different claims mashed together."
1198,"When I look at Vermont's Covid data, something that stands out to me is in by about June 20th the vaccination rate for the first dose started to slow down significantly (less than 0.1% point getting their first dose a day)

And at about that time, 73.3% of the states population had at least one dose."
1199,Fast forward to five months later in November an only 72.2% have received their second dose.
1200,So I am guessing a contributing factor is folks not getting both doses and being only partially protected.
1201,"It's interesting how that data lines up with the increase of cases, which started around mid-July."
1202,"The majority of the vaccines in the state we all administered (65% of the population) got their first dose by May 15, which was 6 months ago meaning the vaccine has been waning in efficacy for the majority of the vaccinated population."
1203,"My assumption is, end of June when they lifted restrictions for the vaccinated opened itself up to more risk taking."
1204,"The vaccinated assumed they were mostly safe, and the unvaccinated didn't care before then but now are not watched as closely with nervousness."
1205,"Now most folks are still wearing masks when you are out and about in public, but I think an overall trend was that after over a year of not seeing friends and family, people started taking smaller more calculated risks by meeting indoors with larger groups of friends and family."
1206,Causing more spread.
1207,"And contributing to that, it could have been that Delta raged in the unvaccinated groups most the past months, circulating in a vaccinated community, and now as those unvaccinated cases are beginning to slow down, at the same time most vaccines are wearing off, that variant is likely to be circulating in the vaccinated groups and causing more breakthroughs."
1208,Eg.
1209,Moderna's efficacy is rated as 89% effective in March (against mostly Alpha variant) and by September that rate dropped to 58% effective.
1210,Doing legal things you disagree with is fundamentally different from encouraging people to actively break laws/regulations.
1211,No doubt.
1212,"In several of the counties near me the 18+ vaccination rate is just ~39%

1221,&gt;Ok I'm boosted personally but why does it feel like I'm getting taken for a ride.
1222,The more shit I see come out about covid is really unsettling.
1223,"Because viruses change, evolve, and adapt to keep spreading and replicating as much as possible, often times in ways that we can't predict ahead of time."
1224,It's a fluid situation and the dynamics will likely change again several times before this pandemic is through.
1225,"I'm not saying you're party to this, but I hate it when I hear, ""Well they said A one week, and then B the next!"""
1226,Yeah!
1227,That's how shit goes when you're dealing with fluid situations which have many moving parts and constantly changing data and variables!
1228,Do you think Nostradamus works at the CDC and can just predict how everything will go years ahead of time?
1229,No!
1230,"There's thousands of scientists researching this every single day trying to get ahead of it, but the fact is, with viruses of this nature, the virus will always be ahead of the curve and researchers will always be trying to keep up with it."
1231,[removed]
1232,I‚Äôm just here day dreaming wondering if being constantly exposed to this virus will be the best case for long term immunity.

1401,"Yes, ""Covid Arm"" is a thing and a known reaction to Moderna, which I have had all three times."

1403,Ebola isn't an incredibly efficient virus because it kills its host so quickly.
1404,"Yes, it's scary and yes, we should be concerned about it, but one of the reasons why COVID is dangerous is its long incubation period, how often it's asymptomatic, and how long it can take to kill the host."
1405,"That was a broad generalization, I know."
1406,So more specifically the body can't maintain all known antibodies indefinitely but some specific ones can be maintained longer than average.
1407,(I wonder how the body knows which one's to keep around??
1408,Some kind of evolved response?)

1469,Theres little to no benefit unless its N95 or better minor droplet and particulate stoppage is really inconsequential.
1470,"I think when we get to the point of ‚Äúnot enough study‚Äù not enough really has been looked into immunity of stuff like Covid infection then vaccine, Covid vaccine than breakthrough, J&amp;J which seems to work better for t/b cell response as a booster to Pfizer/moderna in the long term etc."
1471,"A study I saw last week showed while it was less overall effective the J&amp;J wasn‚Äôt waning, so even if you can create some lower efficacy baseline with it by either using it first or second or third in the administration schedule you might be able to create like a lower floor of Immunity."

1522,I strongly suspect that the origin story of the virus isn't so clear cut and simple.
1523,My bet would be that it spilled over from bats to humans in rural china as part of bat guano collection out of caves for fertilizer.
1524,Then it infected farmhands and initially spread poorly in humans (and quite poorly in less densely packed humans) but spilled over into racoon dogs (or another intermediate animal) which formed a reservoir for the virus.
1525,Then it spilled backwards and forwards and was physically transported via racoon dogs into the dense population of humans in Wuhan where the market formed the first real superspreading event and took root in humans.
1526,"There was probably the initial mutation and acquisition (probably) of a furin cleavage site in bats which allowed it to infect humans, then a variant which acquired the ability to superspread in humans happened shortly before the market event (then came D614G, then Delta dramatically improved the FCS later, etc)."
1527,"The farmed animals probably weren't the source but were a bioreservoir that kept it going until it got better at infecting humans, and found a tightly packed population center."
1528,That makes humans the intermediate animal between bats and racoon dogs and since humans are a pervasive species with a wide range across China it easily explains how bats in Yunnan and racoon dogs could be connected.
1529,And it explains the similar transport of SARS-CoV-1 from bats in Yunnan to racoon dogs in Guangdong.

1535,We *really* need to be looking into how widespread this is.
1536,It could potentially be a big factor for the discrepancy in vaccination rates and infection spread.
1537,"I've personally never seen, or heard of any kind of enforcement of vaccine cards **beyond** just asking to see them."
1538,Given it's literally just printing out a little 3x5 card (or even just having a photo of one in some cases) it would be ridiculously easy to fake with almost no chance for repercussions.
1539,You seemed shocked that people could go back to their normal lives after a lot of people have died of Covid.
1540,But you not having any reaction to the larger number of people who died from heart disease has me wondering what you were really shocked about.

1853,The flu vaccine is every year - because there are a lot of different flu viruses.
1854,"So there will either be a yearly covid shot as well, or there will be lasting immunity after 3 or possibly 4 shots."
1855,"Now that we have a lot more data, it looks like it would have been better to space out the first two shots further - like 2.4 to 3 months rather than 3 weeks (Pfizer) or 4 weeks (moderna)."
1856,"Boosters only really started being administered at the end of the summer, so there's not much in the way of data on them yet after another 6-8 months."
1857,"Also, putting all that aside, we'd be much further along towards ending this if everyone eligible got their initial shots and now booster."
1858,"At the beginning of the outbreak they did, but I don‚Äôt really see any evidence that has maintained the entire time."
1859,Do you have any evidence of this?
1860,It‚Äôs pretty hard to hide an out of control pandemic inside a country for two years.
1861,And On the point of welding doors.
1862,The whole thing about welding people inside their apartments is actually just a myth.
1863,What actually happened is that in some buildings they would weld off exits so instead of people exiting through several different entryways they would all go through one exit to help control the spread better.
1864,The whole thing about welding people in their apartments is just a fucking lie.
1865,I live with Long covid every day of my life it‚Äôs totally fucked me up.
1866,I was an athlete two years ago and now I can barely get up the stairs.
1867,What Kind of fucking freedom is this?
1868,"Before Delta, that might have been good enough, but now we're seeing immunity waning from a combination of immunity just naturally waning a bit, of the short interval between the first two shots not being optimal, and also Delta being a much nastier strain."
1869,What worked before isn't working now.
1870,The stats bear this out.
1871,"In trials, the population with boosters had 90% fewer hospitalizations, severe illnesses, and deaths than the population with two shots."
1872,Add to that speculation that they should help with transmission and with the potential to develop long COVID and it seems clear that the smart thing to do is get a booster.
1873,"We get them for most other vaccines, anyway."
1874,"It's currently *not* clear if we'll need more boosters, since a big driver of the current need is Delta, and if another, worse variant doesn't show up, this might be enough."
1875,[removed]
1876,no
1877,This right here.
1878,"I think many people are assuming that the booster will only last as long as the first round, but haven‚Äôt there already been reports that the boosters last AT LEAST 9 months afterwards (bc that‚Äôs as long as we have data for them)?"
1879,The last time I heard that was months and months ago.
1880,If not even last year.
1881,All the people going ‚ÄúI‚Äôm good with 2‚Äù in these comments make zero sense.
1882,Are you just refusing booster shots to be indignant?
1883,Having a fit because a virus that doesn‚Äôt give a shit about what‚Äôs convenient for you continued to be a problem?
1884,"Why are you so opposed to a third shot if you‚Äôve already gotten two and are therefore, hopefully, not an antivaxx moron (with the obvious caveat of if you have health issues or reaction problems to the prior vaccines.)"
1885,This comment thread and upvotes with borderline anti-vaxx arguments and r/Conspiracy level takes feels more like a bot/brigading attempt than anything similar to the booster discourse on this sub for months.

2099,"Of course, my view is that policy can't account for this and there must be a reason why the virus is easier to control in that region -- maybe COVID is related to a virus that spread more in some places than in others, or something like that."
2100,But if Japan can mostly control COVID then it's not strange to think that China can control it even more with some extra-tough policies.
2101,"It doesn't have much of a lesson for other regions, of course, until we figure out how to do what Japan did (I don't think we can, but at least they're a more plausible comparison than China or New Zealand)."
2102,"Of course the downside of zero COVID is that it only works until you stop, and once it became clear that COVID wasn't going to burn out like the original SARS, everyone has had to reckon with the fact that they will have to accept a COVID wave (or several) at some point."
2103,This sort of incentivizes China's government to keep it up for as long as they can; maybe the vaccines and treatments will improve to the point that they don't have to accept that wave.

2387,This was obvious in the US where the cities were hit hardest first even though the R (infectivity per person) value was much lower for covid in the beginning compared to now.

2394,"Yes, the United States couldn't do as well as Taiwan could have due to WAY larger population."
2395,This big of a difference does start to make a difference.
2396,"However, the US could have done significantly better and failed."
2397,China has way bigger populous than US though and managed way better.
2398,The pandemic taskforce that was removed by Trump was meant to identify a disease three months in advance.
2399,Taiwan was highly successful because it identified the problem early and implemented strategies to effectively deal with it.
2400,The same with new Zealand.
2401,"It would have been very feasible if the US identified it early to cut off all boarders, stop travel, implement a couple week hard quarantine through the whole country."
2402,Our national guard and military could have been used to deliver food during this time.
2403,Then we could have retained this hard border lockdown with no entry.
2404,Then country could have opened back up more inside.
2405,This would have inevitably been better for the economy than what we did.
2406,This is exactly what New Zealand did.
2407,It wouldn't have been perfect but way better.
2408,If you extrapolate the death rate in Taiwan or new Zealand per population and apply it to the US population the death total is tiny compared to what we currently have.
2409,Even if you multiple those numbers by a value of ten it's still a fraction of the death we saw...

2469,The Moderna booster is only half of what each of the first two doses was if that makes you feel any better.
2470,"Okay, can‚Äôt find a straight answer anywhere but are general adults eligible for the booster?"
2471,"Yup, and I get the impression that the ""high risk"" people ""qualifying"" is to make sure the supply can meet the demand for those most at risk, but I have to break it to them...there isn't a supply issue at this point."

2487,&gt;	Fun fact: the CDC has an entire team of health communication specialists that apparently do absolutely nothing.
2488,"This is entirely on purpose, and the CDC (and other agencies like the FDA) wish it was otherwise."
2489,"I‚Äôve worked pretty extensively on public health messaging issues (as a researcher, not as a marketing person)."
2490,The rules governing what government agencies are allowed to say are both extensive and draconian - more so than in other western nations.
2491,"Industry will fight tooth and nail every step of the way, too, if they‚Äôre opposing a public health campaign that affects their bottom line."
2492,"As a result, we‚Äôre left with a combination of milquetoast advocacy and short term campaigns that expire before they can take full effect."
2493,There‚Äôs also massive funding issues.
2494,What we need is a WWII style information campaign with a whole of government kind of effort.
2495,"It‚Äôs not legal, not funded, and would be vigorously opposed by appropriately half of our elected representatives."
2496,"Hell, one of our most prominent political leaders just cussed out Big Bird for trying to make kids less afraid of getting a shot."
2497,"Imagine how good the ad campaigns would be if half of Coca-cola was actively trying to run the company into the ground, and getting promoted for doing so."

2502,"We literally don't even bother asking if anyone is qualified or not for boosters because the ""qualifications"" are so vague that it's pointless to ask."
2503,This is exactly the problem of relying on people‚Äôs ‚Äúexperiences‚Äù rather than science.
2504,"People gave experience with the flu, but most other diseases fade into the background once a vaccine is developed."
2505,"Even with the flu, most people only catch it once every 5 to 10 years, so it‚Äôs not a yearly disease for most people."
2506,I would use a lot of caution trying to extrapolate what we know about the flu for coronaviruses.
2507,MA
2508,Theres really no reason to spread fear about this.
2509,If you're vaccinated you're as protected as you can  be.
2510,Studies are showing that the vaccinated and unvaccinated can spread Covid just as easily as one another.
2511,Their choice to put their safety at risk at this point has little bearing on your own.
2512,This is why we're still seeing breakthrough infections at high levels in countries like Israel and Singapore that have over 80% vaccination rates.

2523,"It was absolutely a science thing that then became ""corrupted""."
2524,"The message was not ""don't wear masks""."
2525,"It was ""don't wear masks unless you're sick""."
2526,The people (excluding healthcare workers etc who needed to be protected in their line of duty) who wanted to wear masks were largely selfish; they wanted to protect themselves.
2527,"Whereas from a public health perspective, when there are limited masks, the masks should be worn by those who are infected."
2528,"With SARS, people were only infectious after they developed symptoms."
2529,"And before March 2020, the only reports of pre-symptomatic Covid transmission were lousy China anecdotes."
2530,What's worse is that a high profile NEJM article about a Chinese conference attendee in Germany spreading before symptoms developed was [torn apart](https://www.science.org/content/article/paper-non-symptomatic-patient-transmitting-coronavirus-wrong) after it was discovered that she fell ill enough to take acetominophen/paracetemol.
2531,"If there was no such thing as pre-symptomatic transmission, then the general public didn't need to wear masks unless they had symptoms."
2532,"But then, 2 well- researched articles demonstrating multiple cases of pre-symptomatic transmission were accepted and published in CDC's journal on March 27 and April 1, 2020."
2533,"[https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/69/wr/mm6913e1.htm](https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/69/wr/mm6913e1.htm)

On April 2 or 3, CDC then made the U-turn to recommend universal masking, including cloth/homemade masks to protect others from the wearer, rather than the other way around."
2534,It was absolutely a science-based decision.
2535,But the messaging failed to convince the public.
2536,And people had a hard time separating the concepts of wearing a mask to protect yourself vs protecting others.
2537,"You‚Äôre still fully vaccinated because there was no 1&amp;2 for J&amp;J. I wish there was one vaccine but if you have the/a card, you‚Äôre the special case as far as I know?"
2538,"I got mine on 05/05 but in the state I live in (CA), rite aid, cvs, and Walgreens are all saying I'm not eligible."

2561,It‚Äôs not the messaging - we‚Äôre watching a pandemic in real time.
2562,Findings change.
2563,"Yeah, you could also make a case that PA is a southern state too because it touches Maryland."

2565,See how silly this gets?
2566,"PA is not a midwestern state, it was not a part of the frontier when the midwestern states were found, and geographically it does not fit the bill."
2567,"Some cities of PA are apart of the rust belt, but that isn‚Äôt just unique to the Midwest."
2568,The masks further reduce the transmission of COVID.
2569,"The more people use them, the less transmission."
2570,Whether that is the right tradeoff between risk and convenience it's a different matter ...

2771,The flu and SARS-CoV-2 viruses are structurally very different.
2772,The COVID vaccines target a protein that if mutated too much would disable the virus.
2773,So the current vaccine still works very well against delta.
2774,The reason the efficacy against infection is going down is more about the dosing interval and maybe some due to the dosage.

2802,My husband had an extremely mild case of Covid in 2020.
2803,He got vaccinated at the beginning of this year and was in bed for days.
2804,I know it's not always the case but it irks me when everyone just assumes any bad reaction they get from the vaccine must be worse than Covid.
2805,Covid is actually extremely mild for most people who get it.
2806,Edited- typo
2807,I suppose.
2808,I will never wear a mask for the flu.
2809,"Covid I understand in certain situations, but the flu is not worth the annoyance of a mask."

2853,Just sayin.
2854,Regarding night sweats.
2855,Do you have extensive dental work?
2856,Let me explain.
2857,For about a decade every so often I‚Äôd get these feverish nights.
2858,Some nights I felt like I was running a fever other nights I actually was.
2859,Towards the end of that decade there were 2 occasions where I had a 103 fever for multiple days and I assumed this was a flu due to it being flu season.
2860,Well at the start of the pandemic my teeth all suddenly shifted.
2861,I thought it was weird but figured it was maybe due to my teeth shifting.
2862,I had braces as a teen.
2863,The bottom teeth had begun to move.
2864,I thought that was what had happened.
2865,I go see my dentist.
2866,He sends me to get a root canal through a tooth I had a big filling in.
2867,It stank like death.
2868,I had dead nerves under the tooth that began rotting.
2869,It had likely been like this for awhile.
2870,"Anyway, since having had this root canal done I haven‚Äôt had a fever once nor night chills."
2871,Looking back I think occurrences of fever were when I put my body under a lot of stress.
2872,This let the bacteria under the tooth spread and cause a fever due to infection.
2873,Another guy I knew went in and out of hospitals for a decade and was told he had autoimmune of some kind and he was going to die.
2874,After an mri a doctor noticed a dental abscess.
2875,When he had the tooth removed it was also dead tissue behind it.
2876,"Anyway, if the issue continues mention it to your dentist"
2877,People saying we all need third dose now and in my country 60% of the population hasn't even received first dose (and is not going to receive)
2878,I guess this is why planes haven‚Äôt been superspreader events much (as far as I know?
2879,"), as I think they filter that air."
2880,"I‚Äôve seen some charts that an infected person on a plane only infected several people, not the whole or almost whole plane, which was surprising to me."

2893,"In England we have about 100-200 deaths a day but zero domestic restrictions, so life is 99.9% normal here."
2894,Most people pay no attention to the number of deaths.
2895,"Hi, I just had my second vaccine shot, and I'm afraid if maybe it was administered incorrectly."
2896,"This is because it was done so quickly like half a second or less, seemingly, and also it didn't feel as though the needle did anything more than pin prick me."
2897,"In comparison to my first shot, it felt significantly different, so much that I exclaimed, this time, ""was that it!?"""
2898,I knew that it's supposed to be a muscular shot and so after  just Googled and an article said that is indeed important that it goes into the muscle.
2899,"By contrast, the person who administered it told me to go loose and let my arm drop down."
2900,And then there was a less than 0.5 second pin prick and it was over.
2901,What should I do?
2902,(Maybe I'm being silly and my arm will ache really badly tomorrow like it did after the first shot that was definitely administered correctly...).
2903,Thanks
2904,"To be fair, while I agree 100% that they could &amp; should have done more, I have some difficulty seeing how they could have stopped covid from going global."
2905,Covid has flu-like symptoms and it was peak flu season.
2906,Not to mention that Covid is also the most infectious when a/presymptomatic or with very mild symptoms.
2907,How do you identify the &lt;0.01% covid patients among those showing flu-like symptoms in the very earliest stages of covid?
2908,And how would you even possibly stop a/presymptomatic ones?

2921,Agreed - why are we being gaslit on case counts?

3194,You'll get people arguing with you because they're conveniently ignoring the pile of over a million dead Americans.
3195,&gt;As you an see the most cases occur within older people.
3196,This is simply not true.
3197,"Most deaths and hospitalizations are in old people, but cases are not."
3198,The last huge wave in Spain e.g.
3199,was completely driven by unvaccinated young people (who largely did not have a chance yet to get vaccinated) and then spread to the (mostly vaccinated) older generations.
3200,"The deaths and hospitalizations were then mostly (but not exclusively) older people, but the reason they got infected was almost entirely due to the insane spread among unvaccinated younger people."
3201,"Until then cases were really low, and it is absolutely clear from the timeline that the unvaccinated were the cause of the peak, which ended up affecting the vaccinated older population (since protection is not perfect as we all know)."
3202,People who intentionally don't get vaccinated are willingly killing others.

3204,Exactly.
3205,"I'm vaxxed, probably going to get my booster soon, and my family is all vaxxed (actually, every person I spend any time such IRL is) so I'm not going to hold out on any celebrations."
3206,The high costs estimates of PHRMA and other industry groups like Tuftss use quite a few sly tricks to get people believing in highly inflated development costs to justify the backend costs leading to incredible revenues.
3207,One is the make believe pixie dust profits may have earned if they put research money into another aspect other than inventing drugs ‚Äî like buying ads for old products.
3208,That comedically adds more than $1 billion on purported costs.
3209,"High cost of development estimates many times is from untestable data, ignores enormous tax subsidies that reduce costs and inflates results with imaginary expenses, such as profits that could have been earned if drug companies invested research dollars elsewhere."

3215,"Second is that Delta arose and started ravaging the world, and it's more infectious."
3216,The good thing about that is that similar problems won't necessarily arise in the next half year.
3217,It‚Äôs a bit of a shit excuse when you spend more on marketing and stock buybacks.
3218,"Yeah, why bother slowing it 99% if it doesn't completely fix everything and stop it completely?"
3219,It's so much better to not even bother trying.

3353,The kids were only 5 months out from their shots but with school and life I wanted to make sure they were covered.
3354,We had no issues afterwards.
3355,Maybe a slightly sore arm.
3356,"Yes, as I said, all of this is premature to assume."
3357,But the fact that COVID infection plus vaccine can create stronger immunity implies that there is nothing innate about SARS-CoV-2 that precludes sustained immunity in immunocompetent individuals.
3358,"We developed, trialed, and began a mass rollout of vaccines in less than a year."
3359,"We knew two things about them: they were safe, and at least over the trial window, highly effective."
3360,"While everyone was optimistic (myself included) that the two-dose vaccines would be durable, I don't think anyone is *surprised* that they are not."
3361,"That does not mean that they cannot be made to be more durable through an improved dosing schedule (which, unsurprisingly, was not a priority in testing given the incredibly compressed timeline for development)."
3362,"Regardless, there will not be a permanent 6 month booster schedule."
3363,"A more effective dosing schedule will be figured out (e.g., first dose, second dose two months later, third dose eight months later, etc) potentially followed by annual boosters being the worst case scenario."
3364,We did two doses in super rapid succession despite most people not believing it was optimal.
3365,"That wasn't because the people trialing the vaccines were dumb, but they were trying to save hundreds of thousands (to millions) of lives by developing and testing vaccines as quickly as possible."
3366,They achieved that.
3367,"excerpt:

Now, an NIH-funded team has discovered at least part of Delta‚Äôs secret, and it‚Äôs not all attributable to those widely studied mutations in the spike protein that links up to human cells through the ACE2 receptor."
3368,It turns out that a specific mutation found within the N protein coding region of the Delta genome also enables the virus to pack more of its RNA code into the infected host cell.
3369,"As a result, there is increased production of fully functional new viral particles, which can go on to infect someone else."
3370,I wonder if the 225 million vaccine doses that the U.S. delivered to other countries is helping put a dent in that.
3371,"If not, the 1.1 billion that we've promised should help, along with those being provided by the other wealthy nations of the world."

3382,"And nobody is gonna be coming around trying to punish people for this, anyway."
3383,"You need to criminalize non-compliance, catering to selfish, ignorant assholes who don't give a shit about anyone but themselves has cost the lives of MILLIONS in this pandemic."

3389,Germany has few ICU beds left.
3390,One thing people are still scared of is the myocarditis issue.
3391,We still don‚Äôt actually know how common it will be in this age group.
3392,The theory is that it will be no worse than we see for older kids and probably better due to the lower dose but there is no actual data for it yet.

3396,I was literally third in line with mine on the first day they were available.
3397,We would have been first but someone needed the bathroom after we turned in the paperwork.
3398,That is not how logical discourse works.
3399,Some of you were making the absolute statement that there can be no other states other than herd immunity/zero covid and exponential growth.
3400,I have given you counter examples.
3401,Coming back with more examples such as Singapore and Denmark doesn‚Äôt further your argument.
3402,"If you want to argue for an absolute statement, the burden of proof is on you to disprove all counter examples."
3403,"\&gt; the only few nations that have slightly slower growth than the rest are those with a higher degree of natural immunity

Sweden is not ‚Äúslightly slower‚Äù growth rate."
3404,They simply didn‚Äòt have any exponential growth at all throughout delta.
3405,"And as far as we know, natural immunity is roughly equivalent to a partial vaccination."
3406,You‚Äòre making my point by implying natural immunity could be another factor.
3407,this basically contradicts what some of you said earlier.
3408,The argument you made has now gone from ‚Äúthere cannot possibly be any state other than herd immunity/exponential growth‚Äù to ‚Äúwe could eventually get to endemic through non-vaccination means‚Äù.
3409,Do you notice the logical fail here?
3410,The latter basically argues against the former.
3411,It‚Äôs called moving the goalpost.
3412,\&gt; but most likely they will also end up exponential as well.
3413,now that‚Äôs just speculation without evidence.
3414,What happens to science and being fact/data driven?
3415,This is brilliant.

3731,"That is the explanation for the ""uptick,"" not waning effectiveness against hospitalization."
3732,"People didn't got fearful enough about the pandemic,."
3733,With climate chaos avoiding fear is not an option.It will hit everyone everywhere on various timelines but all will be affected and it will be much much much worse than corona.
3734,god damnit why will it never reach my age
3735,"Healthcare *personnel*, not healthcare *professionals*."
3736,"My hospital (in Canada) said they record 94% vaccination rate among nurses, 98% among physicians, but much lower among support service (porters and cleaners) and clerical."

3738,Got my 2 youngest signed up for this Friday.
3739,I'm so relieved.
3740,So damn relieved!
3741,My husband and myself are due boosters and our two oldest are fully vaxxed.
3742,So I'm glad to not have to stress about our 8 and 11 yr old finally.
3743,"To me, it conjures the idea of imprecise, random stabbing which just feels like something a vaccine should not be."
3744,"I‚Äôm certainly not in a place to do anything about the usage, but I can‚Äôt help but be annoyed by it."
3745,Are the schools in your area doing clinics?
3746,"My kid‚Äôs school was booked up, but I was able to take him to the neighboring town‚Äôs elementary school clinic."
3747,Google local vaccine clinics and you might find something.
3748,"I wonder what pandemic levels there will be after Thanksgiving, not travel but cases."
3749,Take care and stay safe everyone!
3750,It's not freedom though.
3751,"They can still get it, spread it, and will still require a booster in 6-12 months at the rate we've been going."
3752,"FWIW, I'm not a Republican and I am vaccinated, but you have to be real of the situation."

3762,"I'm not going to keep them isolated because I know the risk level is low and I think socialization is important, but I'll still feel better once they're both vaxxed."
3763,"I don't want to screw them up, haha!"
3764,"(With covid or with lack of socialization... or any of the million other ways I could screw them up, LOL)."
3765,What happens when 10% of the pop gets ebola at once?

3776,Oh hmphhh I got a waste prevention shot when I got mine and they did ask you to check why you qualify (smoking being one of them).
3777,My mom actually told me to check that box before realizing waste prevention was actually an option... but the fact that they ask tells me they are using that data *somewhere*....
3778,They actually don't have answers and don't know what's going to happen.
3779,"That's why we've been seeing the constantly moving goalposts, statements then redactions, slightly altered headlines."
3780,"&gt; Unfortunately, I have quite a few relatives who haven't even gotten their first 2 shots; some of them extremely vulnerable health wise to complication

Sorry but at this point when people are saying it'll likey be a 3 shot regimen to get best and possibly longest lasting protection... and people are willinglyl walking around with 0 shots I don't really have ay sympathy for what's gonna happen to them."

3881,And I'm ineligible for the booster :(
3882,The one I'm familiar with I believe has an associates.
3883,My point is simply that the education of a lot of the healthcare workers isn't somehow above those of other white collar professionals for example.
3884,So holding them to a higher standard is fools gold IMHO.
3885,It wont be bubonic plague as we know how to treat it.

3897,I wasn‚Äôt trying to say exposure without being vaccinated.
3898,I was thinking vaccines plus exposure.
3899,I don‚Äôt know I‚Äôm kind of just rambling through some thoughts
3900,"I know it's probably still too early to have enough data, but is there anything on breakthrough infections in those who are boosted?"
3901,"My mother and my in-laws, who are all boosted, are pressuring us for visits with our too-young-to-be-vaccinated child (we live rather far from all of them)."
3902,"My spouse and I are also boosted, but our parents are much more lackadaisical about wearing masks and they go out to eat, etc."
3903,They promised to be much more cautious leading up to our visit.
3904,"I don't want to deny visits, especially if I'm just being overly anxious, but I am concerned about our kid being exposed (our kid is at home with me instead of in school and doesn't have much opportunity for exposure at this point)."
3905,They're all immunocompromised and none of them had any side effects from their first two vaccinations and had mild reactions to their boosters.
3906,"I know that it's possible to mount an effective immune response from a vaccine even when one doesn't have the typical side effects, but I do worry that maybe they're only riding on their response to the boosters."
3907,"On the other hand, since we were all relatively recently boosted, I figured it's better to get the visits done now rather than wait when cases might be surging and even boosted immunity might be waning."
3908,It's not as bad as the vaccinated but it happens and when they're syptomatic they probably spread it just as much.
3909,As immunity from the first shots wanes it'll get worse too.
3910,They are still greatly protected from severe illness but you're talking millions of people slowly becoming more susceptible to catching/spreading.
3911,So boosters are needed for all.
3912,Right now.
3913,I have heard that being vaccinated after having Covid can give a very robust immunity effect.
3914,"Sorry, I don't know where the source of that information came from."
3915,[removed]
3916,Why is this NY data a month behind..?
3917,"I upvoted your comment, because I think it's a valid point for some workers in a healthcare setting, but not for X-ray technicians who often have a bachelors, at least an associates degree, and typically a semester of pharmacology."
3918,"So yes, an X-ray tech should have the knowledge to know better."
3919,"Also, there's also a lot that can be picked up in the workplace, and the opportunity for interaction with people who are knowledgeable in a healthcare setting certainly exists."
3920,I have a doctor appointment next Tuesday I plan on asking for my booster then.
3921,Had mine Saturday.
3922,"Felt a little tired later in the day, but biggest effect was just a sore arm for a few days around the shot."
3923,Moderna.
3924,I mean we actually understand germ theory now so it‚Äôs highly unlikely we‚Äôll get another pandemic like the Black Plague anytime soon.
3925,"&gt;	Wait 8-12 weeks for shot 2

6 weeks is the max interval to be considered ‚Äúfully vaccinated‚Äù by the CDC."
3926,the last few decades in first world nations have been unnaturally safe compared to most of human history where every generation was expected have a bunch of people die.
3927,Even as late as the 1800's it was normal for half of kids to die by age 5. in 1800 it was normal for 1/3 of kids and or mothers to die in labor.

3934,"It‚Äôs why children are vaccinated against influenza, meningitis, chickenpox, and hepatitis‚Äînone of which, even before vaccines were available, killed as many as SARS-CoV-2 per year."
3935,"No one wants to go to office Christmas parties, who are they trying to kid?"
3936,"I think that might be why he used the qualifier, ""We're ***starting*** to see..."", It's not a significant amount yet, but we shouldn't wait until it becomes significant before pointing out such trends."

3939,"To the rest of the country, you guys weird us out."
3940,Wouldn't the vaccine be a better public health measure?
3941,[removed]
3942,While I agree the statement is a bit of a stretch.
3943,The scientific community that are hesitant against boosters are largely of the argument that we should be using those doses to vaccinate the rest of the world.
3944,"The idea of waning protection and the need for boosters, eventually, is not denounced by this as it is also a scientific accuracy that they will be needed."
3945,Honestly the biggest issue I have with any new restriction at this point is that the people who are mostly going to observe them are probably the people who already have 2-3 doses of vaccine and the people who are likely to just thumb their nose at them and ignore it are people who have not gotten vaccinated.
3946,It's effectively punishing people who did the right thing.
3947,"I'm not saying there is a good alternative, especially in places where hospitals are filling up again."
3948,Just that it stinks that responsible people are being asked to once again carry water for those who are not being responsible.
3949,"Not that I'm suggesting culling all the deer, but what would be the severe consequences to our ecosystem?"
3950,2nd shot of Moderna was April 9th.

3956,My 11 year got his first shot a week ago and my husband was fully vaccinated back in April.
3957,Both have COVID.
3958,I so far am negative but I got a booster 2 weeks ago and my 13 year was vaccinated in June.
3959,Thought we did everything right and was so close to getting my youngest fully vaccinated but it still got through.
3960,All at the same time where a family member who is a doctor does not believe in the vaccine.
3961,üò°
3962,[removed]
3963,Yep.
3964,Did the calculation.
3965,According to [Fast Facts on U.S.
3966,"Hospitals](https://www.aha.org/statistics/fast-facts-us-hospitals), Total Staffed Beds in All U.S."
3967,Hospitals is 920k.
3968,US has a population of 328M.
3969,"Gibraltar has a population of 34k, and 210 hospital beds."
3970,"If we scale the amount of hospital beds in Gibraltar to US numbers, it would be 2M beds (328M √ó (210 / 34k))."
3971,"So Gibraltar has twice of hospital beds when compared to US, when scaled to population."
3972,Does it count as a crime against humanity if the result is beneficial to humanity?
3973,That's exactly what I did.
3974,Next week will be insanity on even trying to get a booster once they green light everyone.
3975,"Smart people are just going ""Sure, I qualify"" with their fingers crossed behind their back and just getting it now to avoid all of that."

3983,This is why I got my buster shot yesterday along with my flu shot....its been obvious for a while that the double jab has a shelf life before it wears off.
3984,This is probably going to be similar to the flu shot where you have to get it every season.
3985,I'm fine with that as long as I can avoid severe illness and death!
3986,In theory?
3987,Sure.
3988,In practice?
3989,I'm not sure it would've mattered much.
3990,"So, for instance your argument with PPE overlooks the fact that the issue wasn't that governments couldn't distribute PPE but that there wasn't enough PPE globally to go around."
3991,"If you recall, the biggest issue was that there were shortages on masks (especially N95)."
3992,That wouldn't have been solved by further more global lockdowns.
3993,"&gt;It sounds like your argument is ""we should just reopen everything to full and never wear masks and not get vaccinated because all of these things just slow it down and it's not even that bad."""
3994,Oh come on.
3995,I'm triple vaccinated.
3996,Vaccines are a proven effective measure and should be the primary method of mitigation and control.
3997,"Masks are mild to moderately efficacious in social settings, highly efficacious when used properly in medical settings."
3998,I 100% support masks.
3999,"[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41562-020-01009-0](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41562-020-01009-0)

This article suggests lockdowns are efficacious, but keep in mind that these are all within the framework of the various interaction effects and doesn't provide any data on diminishing returns over time (and associated costs.)"
4000,Would a two month lockdown have been better than one?
4001,A three month lockdown?
4002,Six months?
4003,What's the inflection point where lockdowns hurt more than they help?
4004,Vaccines never hit that point.
4005,Masks never hit that point.
4006,Ive also had to have multiple vaccines due to orders to transfer overseas - and they can make you feel pretty crappy.
4007,"Just my opinion, but shouldn‚Äôt that complaint should be aimed at crappy employers nagging you because you want time off work for a medical event?"
4008,Instead of the actual push for a vaccine every year?
4009,Idk.

4034,Short answer on your last question: we don‚Äôt know yet.
4035,"Immunologists think it may be more durable after the 3rd dose, similar to how other vaccines work (usually takes 2-3 doses for durable immunity and even then many have boosters after 5-10 years)."
4036,No way to know how long because it‚Äôs only been a year or so since the first people were vaccinated in clinical trials.
4037,"Some immunologists and doctors also think that our very close spacing of the first two doses ended up looking more like one dose to the immune system, since it takes time for the immune system to build its response, so the third dose is really more like dose 2."

4050,Nuh-uh.
4051,Things are binary and there is no subtlety or grey area.
4052,So either it‚Äôs 100% or I have been ‚Äútaken for a ride!‚Äù
4053,That'd be a fine analogy if rich countries had a plan to ever get vaccines out.
4054,Or if they weren't preventing other countries from manufacturing them with IP laws.
4055,It does.
4056,"I have a treadmill at home, but would much rather run outside simply because of the fresh air."
4057,The state is declaring that the entire state population is high risk.
4058,That's untrue and encouraging people to get their booster under false pretenses.
4059,"Yes, both those conditions make it so that you qualify for a booster."
4060,Lessons from thalidomide is why we are running trials on children prior to authorizing the shots for them.
4061,"I know it is frustrating for people with kids under 5 now, but the requirements to test on each population are there for good reasons."
4062,Sounds like a subscription service
4063,What planet is he on?
4064,Shit has been normal since mask mandates were lifted.
4065,My state only has a little over 50% vaccinated.
4066,It's more than any vaccine.
4067,This is exactly why I went and got my booster at CVS with complete disregard for the qualifications.
4068,Technically I'm sure I fell into some category (they are super broad and cover a huge swath of people that probably don't think they qualify).
4069,But I still am just not taking any chances at being a breakthrough statistic because a panel is utterly dragging their feet and putting people in danger as a result.
4070,I meant freedom from worrying about what might happen if any of my kids got Delta.
4071,"I know the chances are very small that they might have a bad case, but my 2 year old nephew had to be hospitalized with Delta just a few weeks ago because he was having trouble breathing."
4072,"He is fine now, but I really dont want to have to deal with that level of parental terror if I dont have to."
4073,They are not needed.
4074,Boosters of the original vaccines provide excellent protection against delta.
4075,"For example, moderna‚Äôs booster raises neutralizing antibody titers against delta by 42-fold."
4076,This is likely multiple times more than is needed to neutralize delta at about the same clip that the original vaccine regimen neutralized the original virus.
4077,"We may need to make updated vaccines at some point, but the time, resources, effort, and confusion that attempting to do so now for delta would far outweigh the potential small (if any) benefit of doing so."
4078,"There wasn‚Äôt a widespread discouragement, but there also wasn‚Äôt a widespread encouragement."

4152,"To some extent, but the vaccine specifically targets the Spike protein, which the virus requires to bind to the human ACE2 receptor."
4153,It can't mutate *that* much without losing the ability to infect us.
4154,Infection acquired immunity is more variable.

4176,Many vaccines work differently.
4177,"Some use dead virus sections (measles vaccine), some use viral vectors (J&amp;J, AstraZeneca, flu), the new type is mRNA (Pfizer, Moderna)."
4178,They all come with different side effects and efficacy depending on the virus they are trying to fight and how your body specifically responds.

4197,And the only way to do that is to assume they are seeing statistics and numbers that we aren't.
4198,"And really, for articles like the one you posted and the one OP posted, the journalist should be the one doing a little research and posting these numbers, assuming they exist."

4379,"It basically said that if everyone on earth had stayed inside for a month we could have been done with it, but that some people had screamed and cried for their freedom to go grocery shopping."
4380,Using something as essential as grocery shopping as an example of something demanded by childish and irresponsible people struck me as ridiculous.
4381,"Correct me if I'm a wrong too, but I believe a large amount of jobs qualify as high risk which means you can get it to."
4382,Yeah I find myself sort of falling into that category.
4383,"I‚Äôve been boosted, but am now wondering how often am I going to have to do this?"

4423,It'll be some mega corporation with a study showing antibody levels dropping and hospitalizations going from 2/100k to 5/100k and then it's time for another round of shots.

4461,"50 percent of people who survive covid-19 face lingering symptoms, study finds

By Linda Searing November 15, 2021 at 8:00 a.m. EST


At least 50 percent of people who survive covid-19 experience a variety of physical and psychological health issues for six months or more after their initial recovery, according to research on the long-term effects of the disease, published in the journal JAMA Network Open."
4462,"Tracker: U.S. coronavirus cases, deaths and hospitalizations
Often referred to as ‚Äúlong covid,‚Äù the adverse health effects vary from person to person."
4463,"But the research, based on data from 250,351 adults and children, found that more than half experience a decline in general well-being, resulting in weight loss, fatigue, fever or pain."
4464,"About 20 percent have decreased mobility, 25 percent have trouble thinking or concentrating (called ‚Äúbrain fog‚Äù), 30 percent develop an anxiety disorder, 25 percent have breathing problems, and 20 percent have hair loss or skin rashes."
4465,"Cardiovascular issues ‚Äî chest pain and palpitations ‚Äî are common, as are stomach and gastrointestinal problems."
4466,"Those affected by post-covid conditions, sometimes called ‚Äúlong haulers,‚Äù can include anyone who has had covid-19, even those who had no symptoms or just mild ones, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention."
4467,"But additional research published in a subsequent issue of the journal found that cognitive dysfunction has occurred more often among those who had more severe cases of covid-19 and required hospitalization, and their brain fog issues have lingered for seven months or more."
4468,"‚ÄúOne‚Äôs battle with covid doesn‚Äôt end with recovery from the acute infection,‚Äù one researcher said."
4469,Could long covid unlock clues to chronic fatigue and other poorly understood conditions?
4470,"‚Äî‚ÄâLinda Searing


where is the deception?"
4471,[removed]
4472,"It's depressingly brutal stuff, but there were kids who survived the actual Holocaust(!)"
4473,"who went on to lead rich, full, normal lives afterward."
4474,"They were loved, lived the through the worst shit imaginable, and that love they got early on allowed them to heal and grow."
4475,The pandemic is pretty modest compared to that experience.
4476,"As such, I've largely just focused on making the kids feel happy/safe and I trust they'll be in good shape as they grow up."
4477,I don‚Äôt think my experience is typical.
4478,I have a long history of severe complications and allergic reactions to vaccines.
4479,I assumed fine with J&amp;J would mean fine with any booster and didn‚Äôt discuss it first with my doctor.
4480,"I think if you overall do OK with other vaccines, you‚Äôll be fine with Moderna"
4481,Had my Moderna boost Tuesday a little sore yesterday along with feeling tired today just soreness at injection site.
4482,[deleted]
4483,Depends on the state
4484,did you read article?
4485,And sometimes it's not.
4486,Like as doses still get wasted everyday because people are confused whether they're in the 85% of adults approved under CDC guidelines.
4487,Same here.
4488,Mine changes based on my states daily numbers which is silly.
4489,My daughter is five and I just want the world to get better for her but it feels like its just getting worse and worse.
4490,Lol.
4491,Pathetic.
4492,What did you do before covid?
4493,[removed]
4494,I agree for what its worth that it \*looks like\* the Covid + vaccine end game is an 'acceptable' position for Western democratic societies without additional measures.
4495,"But it is entirely plausible that that calculus will not apply in other countries, and that a two-tier world arises."
4496,Only now \*we\* will be the 'diseased third world' that yellow card vaccine (cf Yellow Fever) and testing requirements apply to visit from the civilized East.
4497,What about now?
4498,[removed]
4499,Getting my booster shot later today.
4500,I got the J&amp;J shot in March.
4501,Will be getting the Moderna booster.
4502,Unfortunately I misplaced my vaccine card when I moved last month.
4503,I have a picture of it and my immunization record from my state and I know I‚Äôll be able to get a new card with my booster but it‚Äôs still frustrating I won‚Äôt have everything in one place.
4504,"I've read studies refuting that say otherwise, both looking directly at the effect of mask quality vs no mask in droplets, and anecdotal case studies."
4505,Either way I rock n95s and wish the CDC would push for them now that there's not a shortage like there was at the beginning of the pandemic.
4506,The fact that loosely worn bandanas are acceptable is a joke.
4507,How's that freedom panning out for you though guy?

4509,My mother died this morning.
4510,We were estranged but last time I saw her she begged to hug me.
4511,I told her no because she was an antivaxer.
4512,Turns out she had already been infected with the virus.
4513,"At $1000 a dose, it would only cost like half a trillion to fully cover the US (including overhead etc)."
4514,"And bonus, you can put the same clotting agents, graphene, heavy metals, 5G chips and liquid AI in these as you can in vaccines!"

4520,We try to keep things as normal as possible for them.
4521,[removed]
4522,To go from zero knowledge about the virus to where we're at now (millions of lives saved and something close to normal-ish returning for many of us) is nothing short of a scientific miracle.
4523,It's like a space program going from Mercury to the Moon Landing in just a few months.
4524,"I don't want to sound Pollyanna, but we've gone from lockdowns and mass death to a return to many features of life in a very short time."
4525,It's a hell of an achievement.

4531,[removed]
4532,The vaccine is ineffective to the variants right ?
4533,And kids are relatively safe as far as I‚Äôve heard.
4534,You can still spread the virus even while vaccinated right ?
4535,Why are we vaccinating the kids ?
4536,Honest questions
4537,[removed]
4538,I would consult a doctor on your specific case if there are concerns.
4539,"From what I've read, if the first dose didn't trigger a life-threatening reaction, further doses are even less likely to."
4540,But I am not a doctor.
4541,Well that story got dark rather quickly.
4542,Did he admit his mistake at any point?
4543,"Acting like a healthy person walking around without a covid vaccine is similar to someone knowingly spreading AIDS, or a typhoid mary killing people in their path is a little ridiculous"
4544,Ok but then they may have to take off time at a less convenient moment for Covid.

4549,&gt; Nobody is taking anything away.
4550,"That's completely dishonest when people are losing their job for not getting the vaccine, and in certain cities you can't go to a restaurant, bar, and tons of other places."
4551,"Saying ""there are simply consequences"" is the removal of rights."
4552,Yes.
4553,People are stupid and self serving assholes.
4554,A large part of the population.
4555,"Look at EU, a dozen countries can't get 50% of people to get vaccinated."
4556,Stupid assholes.
4557,"my company always did hybrid, kinda weird that apple didn't to be honest, I don't even work for a major tech company, just in the IT department for a major retail company..."
4558,It‚Äôs what my Walgreen‚Äôs had so that‚Äôs what I went for.
4559,As I said this pandemic causes a lot of 20/20 hindsight.
4560,Waiting for another 3 months while opinions change as to what‚Äôs better just leaves me exposed.
4561,I think either one will help give your immune system a boost again.
4562,Japan has vaccinated slower and later.
4563,So there is not yet any significant waning
4564,&gt;I have young children and it makes me sad they have to live through this.
4565,"I do as well and if it's any consolation, I've read quite a bit about how robust kids' psyches are for this kind of thing."
4566,"If they have caring parents who preserve something like normal for them, they'll come through this a lot less affected than we fear they will be."
4567,"Covid kills an extremely low percentage of healthy people, I'm not sure calling it an existential threat is anywhere close to appropriate."
4568,"&gt;I'm not talking about forced sterilization, or tracker implants, or a national approved dress code."
4569,"You said that, not me."
4570,"But on that topic the vaccines fully disclaim there's no evidence that it's safe for pregnant women, or that it doesn't effect fertility in either men or women."
4571,Happy to provide a source for that if you want.
4572,And yet every single person should still be forced to take it?
4573,The problem with the government deciding what medical treatment people get without individuals being allowed to make a decision is that that power can immediately then be abused for whatever they want.
4574,"They could use the population to experiment on them with whatever drug they want to try out, and we don't have the power to refuse it."
4575,The cons of giving them that power far outweigh the benefit
4576,[removed]
4577,Yep.
4578,"Mentally for me the hardest part about this pandemic has been noticing how scientifically illiterate a lot of people are (and  I've been thinking that for decades but oh wow did I underestimate the problem) and how willing they are to live in imaginary reality, and what that means to climate change and humanity's future potential."
4579,"As you can see from other places like the US or Singapore, forcing unvaccinated to pay for covid treatment doesn't change much."
4580,"People that don't want to take the vaccine simply won't take the vaccine, and will go to the hospital if they get sick enough from covid, doesn't matter how much they have to pay."
4581,"So effectively, if you want to shield hospitals from the unvaccinated, only way to do it is really to deny them treatment."
4582,[removed]
4583,A booster less than a year later?
4584,That isn't common.
4585,[removed]
4586,&gt;Concentrate on the best way to live within the current reality.
4587,It really isn't all that bad if you can mentally accept these things.
4588,Me and my friends and family are vaccinated (and boosted based availability).
4589,We hang out regularly.
4590,"There's some risk, but we've made peace with it."
4591,There are modest inconveniences that I still have to deal with in terms of COVID abatement.
4592,They aren't game changers.
4593,"And when I compare what life is like now to what it was like a year ago, it's not remotely the same."
4594,I hope some of these inconveniences can safely go away in future.
4595,But I'm also not going to sit around dreaming of a global time machine to take us back to Fall 2019.
4596,"Awesome, i would love to get a booster before holiday travel"
4597,"Whelp, works for me."

5060,So running into an antigen again after some period of time will trigger more antibody production and nudge the immune system into keeping that family of antibodies around for longer.
5061,So appropriately spaced vaccinations will trick the immune system into keeping the antibodies around longer than they would.
5062,There are also other mechanisms (like various forms of T cells) that learn from infection or vaccination in a similar way.

5083,"Off the top of my head, there are 2 vaccine series done in a 2 shots one month apart and booster 6 months later way."
5084,A small bit of uncertainty is the payoff for having these vaccines developed quickly.
5085,"It's possible the booster will be enough, it's likely we'll have to get this shot yearly."
5086,"As long as there is a large pool of unvaccinated people and this thing continues to mutate in them, uncertainty is going to get worse."

5103,"This isn‚Äôt true

[Some states](https://www.cnn.com/2021/11/16/health/states-allow-booster-shots-for-all-adults-wellness/index.html) have made anyone 18 or older eligible, but this was against current CDC and FDA guidelines

The majority of the population aren‚Äôt eligible."
5104,Can most people get the booster anyway?
5105,Sure
5106,Fire all of them.
5107,People are just turning to denial.
5108,Cold and flu season is also a virus boom season for covid.
5109,"I see people running around the stores right now with no mask, and you know they just have exhausted giving a fuck about it."
5110,"&gt;Over 90% of the elibible population is vaccinated

The virus doesn't really care about eligible populations, it only cares about people who lack immunity."
5111,"In Ireland according to what I saw on the internet, only 12+ populations are eligible."
5112,"So vast portions of the school aged population are unvaccinated, and this is going to drive community spread at a significant level until immunity levels can rise further."
5113,"About 25% of Ireland's total population is likely unvaccinated entirely, and an unclear percentage of the 75% that are vaccinated are boosted, so things are going to be able to spread for quite a while through unvaccinated populations and cause breakthrough infections among the vaccinated populations until more immunity is conferred."
5114,Why should that matter?
5115,Getting vaccinated is objectively better than taking your chances with the actual covid infection.
5116,Nice!

5121,"So hypothetically if you are exposed to the virus almost daily and your immune system works to defend against it, over the course of time you will still lose your immunity?"
5122,I‚Äôd have to think there would then be an intersection point where immunity is on the downward trend and therefore symptoms and an immune response would be on an upward trend.

5135,"True, but I also think that in x4beard's case it's alright."

5146,does any data support moderna being the stronger booster for someone who got pfizer 1-2?
5147,"It has seemed to me that overall, moderna has been stronger than pfizer."
5148,"I read summaries of the ACIP data, where it sounds like the moderna was stronger after pfizer 1-2, but the dose was double the amount currently in boosters."
5149,"I also read today on the ny times that scientists have long suspected that mixing vaccines can produce stronger results, but then I also see that sticking to the same brand is recommended if possible."
5150,Does data support my sense that moderna is stronger in this case?
5151,&gt; People need to start accepting this might be a persistent threat for a long time.
5152,It seems like plenty of people accepted that but most are too selfish to care
5153,Ffs can people stop acting like myocarditis is an issue at all?
5154,It's completely treatable and happens from all kinds of viral infections and you are more likely to get it from covid than the vaccine which probably doesn't even cause it.
5155,MYOCARDITIS IS NOT A BIG DEAL AT ALL REGARDLESS.
5156,The thing is they didn't upgrade the guidance.
5157,"They waffled on boosters and now we have competing info between Fauci, the WHO, the FDA, and questions people are being given on vaccine questionnaires."
5158,You really overestimate the public's ability to take in all this data and be able to understand it as it changes literally day to day.
5159,They could have done the safe thing and recommend universal boosters but didn't.
5160,And now our society is going to pay as another 10-20% of people are going to throw up their hands or just ignore this stuff altogether moving forward.

5166,"If everyone had acted on it early enough, do you think we could've actually wished it away?"
5167,Thats fair just use an N95 or better mask if you want actual protection.
5168,It's really impossible to tell until we have data on how long the booster shots are effective for.
5169,"Some studies have shown antibody levels 5 times greater than after the second shot, so there is some hope that the booster will produce longer lasting antibody levels and therefore longer lasting effectiveness."
5170,But in reality we just have to watch and see what happens to antibody levels and effectiveness among boosted populations and then make decisions based on what happens with those numbers.

5176,that should help you breathe a sigh of relief
5177,Even if it did cause myocarditis...
5178,It's completely treatable and not a big issue by any means.
5179,And we know covid causes the same if not worse heart problems.. so pretty easy choice.
5180,"Yes you follow this correctly We  have moderate/high bias in 31/34 Studies they used for this...Thats ""trust the science"" in 2021 ha ha ha."
5181,Luckily I just trust the people who understand statistics .. because they are experts and know better than me.
5182,The majority of experts mind you not some quack who has a PhD that fucked off from his peers and says all the other experts are lying.

5186,You are allowed to mix and match under CDC guidelines.
5187,It's your choice - but data suggests Moderna is somewhat more protective than Pfizer.
5188,You mean (in layman's terms )that after the booster we can have immunity from serious illness for longer but immunity from infection will fade sooner ?
5189,Did I get it right ?
5190,"In the grand scheme of things, my kid got their shot 3 days later than if I would've signed up for the earliest shot."

5194,**LMFAO...No one actually read the study it doesnt say it cut Covid 19 Cases by 53% at all lmfao ..

5198,"**AND I QUOTE ""the quality or state of being diverse in character or content  between studies was substantial Risk of bias across the six studies ranged from moderate to serious or critical""**

Of these 34 studies the risk of bias was rated as low in three studies moderate in 24 studies, and high to serious in seven studies."
5199,"**\*\*So we have moderate/high bias in 31/34 Studies they used**

This is bullshit, literally no actual scientist would be able to use this as a recomendation for anything at anytime anywhere because of how high the bias is."
5200,By the way they also conclude that Hand washing reduces it as well as mask wearing scoring a 53% reduction lol.

5202,"Wow, it's almost like it's a fluid and changing situation and we're updating our decision making based on new data."
5203,What a crime!
5204,We should make a decision and blindly stick with it forever despite new information.
5205,"Sarcasm aside, nobody can predict the future."
5206,"When the first round of vaccines came out, they were 90%+ effective at preventing symptomatic COVID, and Delta was NOT a thing."
5207,"6 months later, we see waning effectiveness, and a new variant that exploits lower antibody levels, so we update our guidance to respond to the next phase of the crisis."
5208,"It was impossible to know how long vaccine effectiveness was going to stay above 90% at the time the regimen was established, and we had to wait and see what happened before making further decisions."
5209,"We can't just sit back and be constantly behind because we're afraid to update the guidance, in fact I think we waited far too long to take action on booster shots given the data we had at the time."
5210,We're constantly behind the 8 ball and constantly paying the price for it because government agencies are too afraid to change guidance too quickly for fear of public response to even minor changes in guidance and policy.
5211,It's scary.

5363,"&gt; And, if we're making worthy notes, they KNOW that Covid deaths have been underreported, probably in very large quantities especially in cases like Brazil."
5364,"Covid cases have almost certainly been massively underreported as well, for a variety of reasons, which kind of offsets the underreporting of deaths."
5365,"Given the fact that SARS was successfully eliminated from the human population I'd say they probably did a pretty good job of catching most or all of the cases, and so the ~10% CFR is probably fairly accurate."

5376,"They weren't talking about the great lakes region, because if they were they would have included New York."
5377,"The real issue with their point is that they they were wrong about the Midwest is, to the detriment of their actual point."
5378,The Midwest has a population of 68 million as of the most recent census.

5389,But masks are only mandated in areas where vaccination is high - the opposite of what you'd want.

5392,Cope.

5442,Was at my allergists yesterday and brought it up (2nd shot was over six months back).
5443,Given the asthma + I'm old (not 65+ however) + returned to office.
5444,Basically was told it's likely opening up to everyone soon and they aren't really checking anyway so I just scheduled my booster.
5445,"Also figured it's been enough time for those who needed the booster more than me have had ample time, but in before the deluge hits when the CDC says it's open to everyone officially."

5461,Am i not fully vaxxed?
5462,You‚Äôve hit the nail on the head: it‚Äôs hygiene theatre.
5463,"The public health official response will be that any amount of time wearing a mask will help to reduce the amount of potential viral load released, which is theoretically true."
5464,"In practice, though, it‚Äôs simply such a minimal level of additional protection in a highly vaccinated environment that it‚Äôs more about making people feel good than anything about slowing the spread of COVID when vaccines are already doing that more effectively through multiple mechanisms: reducing the rate of initial infection, limiting the severity of illness, decreasing viral load and improved clearance speed."
5465,"More broadly, this is an area where it comes down to decision paralysis from political officials who want to cover their assess and health officials with much lower risk tolerance to the spread of disease than the general population."
5466,Ridiculous (for those not truly immunocompromised)
5467,You‚Äôre good.
5468,The J&amp;J was apparently showing waning efficacy and now you boosted up.
5469,You havnt gotten your 4th dose yet??

5520,"Don't get me wrong, I didn't read the paper, and am not even sure what the 53% means; I was commenting on the 'how can this be true if Germany sucks RN'."
5521,"There's something going on with Germany, and I have no clue what, but I don't see it as a refutation of masks, just as one data point."
5522,"About why LA and Orange County have the same curve, I have a simple (and maybe wrong) explanation ... they're the same freaking thing :) They're both part of 'metro LA'; I'd assume there's a ton of people that work in one and live in the other?"
5523,That would make it almost random which county gets the case assigned to it.
5524,Maybe I'm completely off?
5525,I‚Äôm guessing at the end of the day it‚Äôs probably in the insurance companies best interest to cover the pills for a non vaccinated patient if it prevents a hospital stay.
5526,That‚Äôs going to be significantly cheaper.
5527,[removed]
5528,"This is true, but it‚Äôs also not why it‚Äôs in the story or headline."
5529,"It‚Äôs bc pregnant women are one of the least vaccinated groups, partly bc it took a while for doctors to give them an OK, but mostly because there is so much misinformation targeting these women."
5530,No doubt this woman has completely bought into that misinformation.

5534,I'm great at overthinking.
5535,"If they'd been watching Missouri starting around Memorial Day, the whole country could have seen what Delta was all about."
5536,Instead we were just screaming about all the cases here and no one cared.
5537,Not even our own governor.
5538,"And as a fun bonus, Springfield (the center of the Delta crisis here this summer) has had a massive jump in antibody infusions this week."
5539,"St. Louis had 30% of their hospital patients as vaccinated last month, pre-booster."
5540,The signs are all here for what's coming and no one cares because they want normal so thousands more will die.
5541,[removed]
5542,This post inspired me to find a clinic to accommodate my hectic schedule and I signed me and the mister up for the booster this weekend.
5543,"Wish they would allow boosters for older teens, my kid got her Pfizer early because she had qualifying medical issues but she doesn't qualify as immunocompromised so no boost for her."
5544,"No sadly it was really bad and I should have been hospitalized but didn‚Äôt want a $9,000 hospital bill and was stubborn."
5545,"üòî I was lucky I was able to get the infusion, even though I was almost too sick to get it."
5546,Except the discharge is general under honorable conditions.

5548,How exactly do you propose people eat if literally no one is allowed to shop at or work in a grocery store due to a 100% lockdown for a month?

5550,I thought I can just walk in.
5551,[removed]
5552,"That is why, if you read my comment, I said 'nigh impossible'."
5553,Which does not mean its impossible.
5554,"Fact of the matter is, a place like NZ has tried to get back to COVID Zero for nearly 4 months now, they even closed takeaway, pubs, schools pretty much everything bar essential services and they now are getting more daily cases than NSW which is pretty much open."

5556,"You can try to make excuses about different culture, population, size, being an island all you want."
5557,"The fact is that Taiwan and mainland China are quite different in many of those aspects and both have successfully maintained their zero covid policy, so it‚Äôs definitely not impossible."
5558,"We had 8 people, double vaxed but no boosters, in a conference room all day last Tuesday."
5559,One tested Wednesday and all other either tested negative or have not had symptoms.
5560,The one who tested positive was basically knocked out for 36 hours but was working from home Friday.
5561,"I was in a conference room three weeks ago with someone who tested positive shortly after but no one else, all vaxed, got sick."
5562,"My take on this:
1) vaccines are still pretty good
2) we may only need to get 1/4 or so of the population boosters at this point to get enough dead end hosts to put us to at least intermediate term herd immunity."
5563,"Figure recent infections,  and okay protection remaining with non-boosted should push us over the edge."
5564,3) we're probably getting close to the point where exposures in highly vaxed settings are not really a concern.
5565,"Like I get letting the people in direct proximity know, but I think we're past sending an email out to the entire company or building about a covid case."

5722,Yes.
5723,"Over the past several months as more clinical trials in United States were conducted using thousands of participants (across a variety of Covid-19 vaccine manufacturers), no new safety concerns were identified."
5724,These trials specifically included organ transplant recipients and severely immunocompromised individuals.
5725,[What is compelling is the additional approval allowing for the mixing of vaccines as the booster dose.
5726,This leaves most of us to essentially choose which booster we would like to receive.
5727,"Additionally, this removes any issue with trying to find a location that only has the original manufacturer you received, creating a more streamlined process and easier access to higher protection."
5728,There is already preliminary research from multiple countries confirming the mRNA type vaccines are best placed to deliver a higher antibody response compared to their non-mRNA type peers.
5729,"The findings for an NIH preprint study have been summarized below (see Chart 2), which can aid you in determining which booster type may be best based on your initial series."

5734,You mean the recognition of specific male populations seeing myocarditis?
5735,Or the fact that continually refuse to let poorer countries just make the vaccines themselves?
5736,"The majority of donated vaccines have yet to be used, until the means of distributing vaccines in poorer nation's has been improved then Western nations could probably do those 5x doses without impeding supply at all."
5737,"Ehh, going to be dark for the unvaccinated I guess."
5738,"From way back when this pandemic was kicking off I remember talking to people often reminding them that OSHA was MIA and people were like ‚Äúwait yeah, where the fuck is OSHA in all this?‚Äù      

This is literally their job and they were silent for so long and came into the game so late."
5739,And now this whimper.
5740,In hindsight they were one agency that really abdicated their responsibility in the thick of it.
5741,"It wasn‚Äôt in the messaging, but there was a huge celebration across social media of sitting on the couch all day."
5742,"Still, why wasn‚Äôt there an overt push to get people to exercise more?"
5743,I don‚Äôt go to a gym‚ÄîI run outside.
5744,"Even if people don‚Äôt run, they could walk."
5745,Even taking a few small walks a day beats being stagnant.
5746,But this was never pushed.
5747,"I fully expect the Supreme Court to block it, what I‚Äôm worried about is if they decide to expand the scope of the ruling to throw out Jacobson v Mass"
5748,Can someone science-y explain this a little bit in layman‚Äôs terms?
5749,I tried to Google ‚Äúhigh flower lose‚Äù and all of the search results were marijuana related.
5750,What if we just stopped refusing to allow the poorer countries to make it themselves.
5751,Probably too late now
5752, I do both.
5753,Do my strength training at home and do indoor cycling in a gym.
5754,Yes it's very convenient and saves time to work out at home but the gym has a lot going for it besides all the expensive fitness equipment.
5755,It's nice to workout in a different environment other than your home.
5756,For example I cycle in my gyms spin room (don't do spinning however).
5757,"It's a very big room, airy, good soundsystem and can even setup the lights how I want them, color and such."
5758,Also it's nice to have people around you when you work out.
5759,It can serve as motivation to push it a bit harder.
5760,Also of course you end up getting to know new people.
5761,Can add that since I live in Sweden the gym has been opened for the whole of the pandemic.
5762,No one here uses a mask either.
5763,I guess that is very different from many other countries.

5779,That‚Äôs the shortfall when you start the argument with ‚Äú you should walk in someone shoes‚Ä¶‚Äù.
5780,"Do majority of population share the same pains, probably not, I give you that."
5781,"But that doesn‚Äôt mean kitchens can‚Äôt have more ventilations, a/c pump in cooler air, remedies to improve work conditions."

5790,If that actually holds true we‚Äôll probably start to see vaccination rates drop off in early December.
5791,I‚Äôm curious to see how it goes.
5792,We don't deserve any better.
5793,We still ignore the pandemic.
5794,We now have a dedicated anti-vaxxer political party beside a far-right one that is already anti-vax.
5795,"And then there is a large amount of people who pretend that everyone is always following the rules, completely denying reality, just like the anti-vaxxers."
5796,"Because of limitless laziness there are no controls, no fines."
5797,We learned absolutely nothing in the last 1.5 years and nothing about this is going to change in the following years.

5800,"Vaccines are effective, but coercion and forced vaccination puts a sour taste in my mouth."
5801,lol then what is your solution?
5802,No vaccinated person should ever leave their house again because of the .00001% chance they contract Delta and die?

5813,*
5814,Does your health department have them or are there any clinics at school?
5815,Try getting an appointment for a kid to get the shot in many areas.
5816,It‚Äôs like they took all the lessons of what kind of worked in the last 18 months and flushed it down the toiled.
5817,"California‚Äôs MyTurn site didn‚Äôt have kids as an option on it (still might not, I haven‚Äôt checked in a few days)."
5818,The local pharmacies that dispense it all needed their own websites and at least one of them was dramatically understaffed to handle the number of people they were administering the shot to.
5819,Add in the conflicting information about boosters and we‚Äôre right back to March of 2021 in terms of vaccine distribution.
5820,[removed]
5821,There are studies coming out now about memory B and T cells.
5822,The TWiV podcast (hosted by virologist la and immunologists) goes over new studies and breaks them down.
5823,The reason you‚Äôre being downvoted I suspect is because the way you asked the question and ended your comment sounds like what an anti-vaxxer might say to discourage vaccination or call into doubt that vaccines work.
5824,"Availability varies a lot by region, in a way that tends to match what you might generously term local political sentiment."
5825,"We had success by easily scheduling in a county that had much lower overall vaccination rates than ours and just taking the drive, where our home county has a weeks-long wait."
5826,Your mileage may vary of course.
5827,The positivity rate is 0.3% (during the summer peak it was over 20%) so I don't think it's because of less testing.
5828,Try signing up online for an appointment at CVS.
5829,I was able to do that and receive my shot even those I‚Äôm not eligible
5830,The mass vaccine sites in my area seem to also have the spillover benefit of encouraging flu shots and for parents to get their boosters.
5831,We got our 10 year old in the first week it was available.
5832,They're now running clinics at schools.
5833,They really can't make it any easier.
5834,"Mayor Muriel Bowser of Washington said on Tuesday that an indoor mask mandate in the nation‚Äôs capital would be eased on Nov. 22, reflecting a shift away from mask requirements as coronavirus vaccination rates continue to rise and infections fueled by the Delta variant subside in the city."
5835,"About 88 percent of the District of Columbia‚Äôs adult residents have received at least one vaccine dose, according to city health officials."
5836,"Masks will still be required in certain circumstances, including on public transportation, inside school buildings and in congregate living facilities like nursing homes, college dormitories and jails."
5837,Ms. Bowser said the easing of the mandate did not mean that people should stop wearing masks entirely.
5838,"‚ÄúIt does mean that we‚Äôre shifting the government‚Äôs response to providing you this risk-based information, and recommending layering strategies, as the best way to protect yourself and the community,‚Äù she said during a news conference."
5839,"Washington imposed its current mask mandate in July after the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention advised everyone, whether vaccinated or not, to resume wearing face coverings in indoor public spaces if they lived in an area where the virus was spreading rapidly."
5840,"The agency defined those areas as places that reported more than 50 new infections for every 100,000 residents over the previous seven days, or where more than 8 percent of tests had come back positive over that period."
5841,"As of Tuesday, the District of Columbia was above that threshold, with 81 new Covid-19 cases per 100,000 residents over the past seven days, according to the C.D.C."
5842,"Correction: Nov. 17, 2021

A photo caption that had been included in an earlier version of this article misstated the mask policy at the Smithsonian‚Äôs National Museum of Natural History."
5843,The museum has not changed its policy regarding the wearing of masks.
5844,I completely and fully understand that.
5845,"But what I'm saying is, if people see that, it puts them off."
5846,"Just like when they ask for insurance for testing or vaccines even though it is not required - if people see a ""gate"" like that, it massively increases the likelihood they won't do it, because it's ""on paper"" and therefore a risk."

5853,Needless to say it wasn't super well received.
5854,"Then it‚Äôs not a full global lockdown, is it?"
5855,You can‚Äôt have SOME people working and stop spread entirely.
5856,The lockdowns didn‚Äôt stop spread.
5857,They slowed it.
5858,The second we started moving around again it was going to lead to spread.
5859,Containment was not happening.
5860,[deleted]
5861,"yeah well, is this really so surprising?"
5862,I mean take Munich as an example.
5863,"We have one ""main"" vaccination center, and it's in a really shitty location for most."
5864,I live fairly close to the city center yet it would take almost an hour each way with public transport if I had to get vaxed there.
5865,"In addition, for all this time you could ONLY get vaccinated at that center (or a doc's office, though many did not offer it), even if you lived closer to a vax center in neighboring towns."
5866,"So the Munich center was endlessly booked out while the centers just outside the city were wide open for appointments, but you couldn't get an appointment in those locations if you are a resident of Munich, proper."
5867,Just ridiculous.
5868,"I am personally lucky that I was able to get vaccinated fairly early through my primary doc, but most people I know had to go to some serious effort to get their shots."
5869,And they wonder why vax rates are relatively low?!
5870,"As of two days ago they finally - FINALLY - started offering vaccines at the existing large scale testing centers in town, too."
5871,"These are more centrally located and easily accessible for far more people and opening them for vaccines expands capacity, naturally."
5872,They should have done all of this from the start.
5873,I was very impressed with corona handling in the first year but now it's just a shambles.
5874,It's really troubling and it's starting to piss me off.
5875,They're about to announce boosters for everyone by Thanksgiving.

5877,"But I went to Rite Aid and got my booster, no questions asked."
5878,&gt;Gibraltar has seen cases increase with 66 new daily infections reported on average - equivalent to 52% of its peak in January.
5879,"&gt;The Rock has administered at least 94,469 vaccine doses so far which is enough to have fully vaccinated 140.2% of the country‚Äôs population."
5880,"&gt;‚ÄúGiven the exponential rise in the number of cases, the Government for example intends to cancel a number of its own functions including official Christmas parties, official receptions and similar gatherings,‚Äù its Government said in a statement."
5881,"WASHINGTON ‚Äî The Food and Drug Administration is aiming to authorize booster doses of Pfizer-BioNTech‚Äôs coronavirus vaccine for all adults as early as Thursday, a move that would expand the number of Americans eligible for additional shots by tens of millions, according to people familiar with the agency‚Äôs plans."
5882,The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention‚Äôs independent committee of vaccine experts has scheduled a meeting for Friday to discuss data on the booster dose‚Äôs efficacy and safety.
5883,If both the F.D.A.
5884,and the C.D.C.
5885,"sign off this week, they will have acted strikingly quickly ‚Äî a little more than a week after Pfizer asked for authorization of boosters for everyone 18 and older."
5886,"Under that scenario, any adult who received a second dose of the vaccine at least six months earlier would be officially eligible to get a booster as soon as this weekend."
5887,The F.D.A.
5888,"is expected to rule without consulting its own expert panel, which has met frequently during the pandemic to review vaccine data and make a recommendation ahead of a regulatory decision."
5889,Moderna is expected to soon submit its own request for the F.D.A.
5890,to broaden eligibility for its booster.
5891,"But for now, every adult could get the Pfizer booster, according to people familiar with the planning."
5892,The broad booster authorization has been viewed as something of a fait accompli for weeks.
5893,Some state and local officials have begun rolling out similar policies ahead of F.D.A.
5894,action ‚Äî responding to persistent virus case counts and the eagerness of many Americans to seek additional protection ahead of holiday gatherings.
5895,New York City health officials on Monday encouraged all adults who want boosters to seek them out.
5896,"Arkansas, California, Colorado and New Mexico have already moved to expand access."
5897,Many Americans have taken the matter into their own hands and sought out extra doses even if they do not officially qualify yet.
5898,"[Graph of waning vaccine effectiveness]

The F.D.A."
5899,"in September downsized Pfizer-BioNTech‚Äôs request to fully approve booster doses for all adults, instead signing off on a more limited population, including those 65 and older, as well as adults with underlying medical conditions or those at risk because of their jobs."
5900,"At least 30 to 40 percent of vaccinated adults are still excluded from booster eligibility, according to some estimates."
5901,"More than 30 million people have gotten additional shots, with the number often outpacing the number of first shots given each day around the country."
5902,"Booster doses were also authorized in October for everyone who received the single-dose Johnson &amp; Johnson vaccine, and for vulnerable groups who received Moderna‚Äôs two-dose shot."
5903,"The C.D.C.‚Äôs gathering on Friday is scheduled to be briefer than recent meetings about Covid vaccines, just three hours, and is expected to be straightforward, one federal official familiar with the planning said, in part because of how far the nation‚Äôs booster campaign has come."
5904,That would suggest a significant softening of opposition among public health experts since President Biden announced in August that he hoped to offer booster doses to all adults.
5905,Go no contact with them.

Although India is a small player in overall global exports, it is a major producer of the type of syringe that is being used globally for coronavirus vaccinations."
5977,The syringes break on second use to prevent the spreading of disease through reuse.
5978,"Covax, the vaccine-sharing initiative, is seeking the syringes from manufacturers around the world, and India was expected to meet at least 15 percent of the global demand for use with Covid vaccines and other inoculations."

6057,"Abstract  
Practices such as improved ventilation and air filtration are being considered by schools to reduce the transmission of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) that causes the pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)."
6058,"Improved ventilation may significantly increase the energy cost of heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC), exacerbating financial challenges schools face amidst the worst pandemic in decades."
6059,"This study evaluated HVAC energy costs for reducing COVID-19 airborne infection risks in 111,485 public and private schools in the U.S. to support decision-makings."
6060,"The average annual HVAC energy cost to maintain the infection risk below 1% for the schools in the U.S. is estimated at $20.1 per square meter or $308.4 per capita with improved ventilation and air filtration, where the private schools have higher costs than the public schools on average."
6061,The cost could be reduced by adopting partial online learning.
6062,"It was also found that additional cost to control infection risk with increased ventilation and air filtration is significantly lower for PK-5 schools than that for middle and high schools, indicating the possibility of remaining in-person instructions for PK-5 schools with necessary governmental assistance."
6063,"Analyses of school HVAC energy costs to reduce airborne infection risks under different intervention scenarios provide important operational guidelines, financial implications, and policy insights for schools, community stakeholders, and policymakers to keep schools safe during the ongoing pandemic and improve preparedness for epidemics projected in the future."

6073,Checking in from NC at 9%.
6074,"They literally closed parks and playgrounds in a lot of places, like California."
6075,"Then they reversed it, not because there was no data to support it slowing the spread at all but because they decided it was racist because statistically minorities are more likely to not have a yard."

6107,Basically herd immunity is impossible with the current vaccines.
6108,Not sure about the booster shots though

6187,"So you're fine if you still have high circulating antibodies, but if you have to fall back on the slightly slower response from the memory B and T cells (longer term immunity), Delta can basically out race it to the gate before the body can jump start antibody production."

6245,Every week the hospitalization rate of vaccinated individuals either ticks up or down.
6246,I'm reasonably sure that would be unconstitutional in Germany unless we are talking about actual triage situations where the docs could argue that unvaccinated have such a high chance of dying that it would be a waste of resources.

6290,"This the the behavior we need to see, but overwhelmingly do not see."
6291,"In the US it's basically optional, and people wear them for whatever subjective reason they do/don't."
6292,So it's a shitshow.
6293,"Despite it I wear the safest kinds of masks available, that are acceptable (no vent) and wear them snugly, and since there are studies about the efficacy of doing this as well, I feel confident my unilateral mask wearing brings protection up the the 45-ish range."
6294,Yeah the worst you‚Äôre doing is taking a dose from an antivaxxer so go get a boost
6295,"We'll have to see how the boosted immunity holds up, but so far none of this is really unexpected, or was at least always known as a potential scenario."
6296,"The spacing of the original two shot sequences was pretty much the absolute minimum necessary, and was a known tradeoff of longer term immunity in favor of getting it out of trials and into arms as quick as possible."
6297,"Most two shot sequences space them out by at least several months, if not longer, and some require three shots."
6298,"There's a pretty good chance that original series + booster will provide long term immunity, unless we are stuck with ultra-rapid Delta-style variants where you need continuous high circulating antibodies, in which case we'll see."
6299,people are done with masking to pointless anyway
6300,[removed]
6301,Which shot did you get?
6302,I‚Äôm eligible because I got Pfizer but my so isn‚Äôt *yet*because he got moderna
6303,Target population=anyone older than 12
6304,"I mean, when the vaccines were rolling out, were public health experts supposed to predict that Delta would be such a strong variant?"
6305,"Were they supposed to know exactly how much the efficacy of these brand-new, cutting-edge vaccines would wane over time?"
6306,"Some of these things are a PR faux pas, but some are just public health messaging adapting to evolving circumstances."
6307,This is what we're doing.
6308,"We were very locked down other than going to school, so we have a ton of stuff planned."
6309,Have you had it checked out?
6310,"I developed vertigo, tinnitus and some hearing loss about 4 years ago from Labrynthitis."
6311,Vestibular issues should be investigated as there are many causes.
6312,Menieres disease can be treated to try to prevent further hearing loss.
6313,Certain medications can help vestibular  migraines.
6314,"This is a great informative website

https://vestibular.org/

Also not to worry you, but if it's only in one ear you should be checked out asap."
6315,My husband had hearing loss and tinnitus in one ear and it turned out to be an acoustic Neuroma which is a benign tumour.
6316,He is fine because they caught it and zapped it with radiation so it's not grown but the hearing loss and tinnitus is permanent.
6317,Yes but they have different bottles so people don't get confused.
6318,Also helps with dilution they need to do before hand.
6319,Pfizer had about 6 doses per bottle for 12+.
6320,The kids bottles have 10 doses.
6321,[removed]
6322,"No, he shouldn't."
6323,"10% of kids is great, but once we get past the super-eager crowd, I wonder how high this goes."
6324,Just wondering.
6325,My kids got the fist shot the first weekend our pediatrician had a clinic and it was full of enthusiastic parents yelling encouragement to the other kids there.
6326,"As time goes by, the crowds coming in will be less enthusiastic to be there."
6327,I just wonder where the line is.
6328,A scientist who has pored over public accounts of early Covid-19 cases in China reported on Thursday that an influential World Health Organization inquiry had likely gotten the early chronology of the pandemic wrong.
6329,"The new analysis suggests that the first known patient sickened with the coronavirus was a vendor in a large Wuhan animal market, not an accountant who lived many miles from it."
6330,"The report, published on Thursday in the prestigious journal Science, will revive, though certainly not settle, the debate over whether the pandemic started with a spillover from wildlife sold at the market, a leak from a Wuhan virology lab or some other way."
6331,"The search for the origins of the greatest public health catastrophe in a century has fueled geopolitical battles, with few new facts emerging in recent months to resolve the question."
6332,"The scientist, Michael Worobey, a leading expert in tracing the evolution of viruses at the University of Arizona, came upon timeline discrepancies by combing through what had already been made public in medical journals, as well as video interviews in a Chinese news outlet with people believed to have the first two documented infections."
6333,"Dr. Worobey argues that the vendor‚Äôs ties to the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market, as well as a new analysis of the earliest hospitalized patients‚Äô connections to the market, strongly suggest that the pandemic began there."

6338,We saw something similar to this with the older kids when they became eligible.
6339,Any other pharmacy....
6340,Did you choose Moderna?
6341,I can‚Äôt figure out if the half dose Moderna is better or the full dose Pfizer.
6342,The ineligible population is also ineligible for icu beds  since they would be in the pediatric icu.
6343,The surge in people needing icu beds is not because of children
6344,Important addition: everyone between 5 and 6 months after the second dose.
6345,Before it was rather a religious sticking to 6 months minimum.
6346,And is also like 3/4 of the population right there
6347,They even had data.
6348,"We watched breakthrough infections rise in Israel, and watched them distribute boosters to stave it off."
6349,What did most people do?
6350,Criticized Israel for being greedy with boosters when many other countries havent fully vaxxed their pops yet.
6351,"I mean, yeah, lots of parts of my country havent fully vaxxed yet‚Ä¶cause they apparently don‚Äôt want it!"
6352,Pretty much all your vaccines have always needed boosters stop pretending like this is new
6353,I don‚Äôt think this is accurate
6354,"&gt;It's unsettling because we live a sheltered existence and keep expecting to hear plain steps on how to ""do the right thing"" and make the bad stuff go away in a timely manner."
6355,"I'd add to this that we're used to the hero solving the problem after the commercial break and it's all wrapped up by the end of the episode and get upset when we se ""To Be Continued..."" at the end."
6356,"Anxiety is not a qualification, though it should be imo."
6357,Depression is.
6358,Boosters for everyone are coming soon though
6359,"&gt;‚Ä¶

&gt;With SARS, live-animal markets continued to sell infected animals for many months, allowing zoonotic spillover to be established as the origin and revealing multiple independent jumps from animals into humans (3)."
6360,"Unfortunately, no live mammal collected at Huanan Market or any other live-animal market in Wuhan has been screened for SARS-CoV-2‚Äìrelated viruses (1), and Huanan Market was closed and disinfected on 1 January 2020."
6361,"Nevertheless, that most early symptomatic cases were linked to Huanan Market‚Äîspecifically to the western section (1) where raccoon dogs were caged (2)‚Äîprovides strong evidence of a live-animal market origin of the pandemic."
6362,&gt;This would explain the extraordinary preponderance of early COVID-19 cases at one of the handful of sites in Wuhan‚Äîpopulation 11 million‚Äîthat sell some of the same animals that brought us SARS.
6363,"Although it may never be possible to recover related viruses from animals if they were not sampled at the time of emergence, conclusive evidence of a Huanan Market origin from infected wildlife may nonetheless be obtainable through analysis of spatial patterns of early cases and from additional genomic data, including SARS-CoV-2‚Äìpositive samples from Huanan Market, as well as through integration of additional epidemiologic data."
6364,Preventing future pandemics depends on this effort.
6365,The states of Salzburg and Upper Austria in Austria will go into a full lockdown again on Monday
6366,I have a friend waiting to see if the covid jab for kids causes fertility issues.
6367,"Given that these are under 12 year old kids, this isn‚Äôt something she‚Äôll know anytime soon."
6368,So basically she‚Äôs not getting her kids vaccinated.
6369,hi slowjackal.
6370,This is how I think of it.
6371,Let's say you get a booster.
6372,Your immune system recognizes the same virus and pumps the antibodies out to clear it out again.
6373,While the antibodies are still in your bloodstream if you encountered Covid 19 in the wild you would theoretically be almost immune to infection entirely.
6374,Severe illness is what happens while your immune system figures out the correct counter-attack strategy.
6375,"If it knows what to do almost right away, that's good and you get mild symptoms."
6376,Maybe none.
6377,"The question really is, how much ""training"" for your immune system is ""good enough."""
6378,"And what is the ""Max level"" that can even be achieved?"
6379,0 training- no vax- obviously bad.
6380,2 shots - based on the hospitalization data I still think this is pretty damn good.
6381,3 shots - ???
6382,"really, we just don't know."
6383,"The question to me is can you really ""train"" your immune system for much more preparedness than 2 shots?"
6384,"Based on what I've seen, and experienced, I'm still not convinced boosters are really needed for most people, and think they should have been prioritized only for people with weaker immune systems that can maybe benefit from additional ""training""."
6385,Vaccine production should have been retargeted to focus on countries still struggling to get enough vaccines for their first 2 doses.
6386,"But the boosters are made now so whatever...

Hope the analogies sort of help, but I did just make them up as I went."
6387,I really should not taken as absolute authority on this.
6388,Just trying to stay best informed myself.
6389,It's also so confusing when some states have just said everyone can get a booster.
6390,"I'm 6months out from my 2nd shot but don't qualify for a booster according to the qualifications listed, but everyone I seem to know has gotten one."
6391,I got moderna x3.
6392,Got my booster yesterday and barely had any side effects the 1st 2 doses.
6393,I have never been as sick as I feel right now and the last 12 hours.
6394,Is this normal?
6395,I'm really getting nervous.
6396,My large international company is moving forward in the us anyhow framing it as a ‚Äúsafe reopening evaluation‚Äù.
6397,"most interesting guidelines: vaccinated, no restrictions."
6398,"Unvaccinated: weekly testing, on your own dime, outside of company hours."
6399,Masks are all times.
6400,"Separated and distanced office work space (no guarantee of office location for that, so you might be moved around) No approved business travel, internal or external event‚Äôs/conferences/large meetings."
6401,Also a note about must be able to perform all job functions regardless of restriction.
6402,Basically keeping everyone in the company safe and separated from anti vaxers which i applaud
6403,It will get going soon.
6404,"Don‚Äôt you worry, with enough people not getting the vaccine the virus will mutate again."
6405,[removed]
6406,"&gt; healthcare professionals who have the knowledge to know better

Do they though?"
6407,I personally know some in the field (for example x-ray tech) who barely have what I would call higher education.
6408,Thanks for the response.
6409,"I'm young, physically fit, and have nothing health-wise that should complicate my case."
6410,"I'm just surprised that I feel worse this time than when I got it in 2020, although I'm sure that has something to do with the different strains."
6411,Should there be any concern with getting a false negative and getting the booster?
6412,How long should I wait to get a booster if it does come back positive?
6413,What do you actually disagree with?
6414,You think that countries were ready?
6415,You think that China is a model to follow for liberal democracies?
6416,"I noted that at least three democracies did well: ROK, ROC and NZ."
6417,"What ""stupidity"" was on display here?"
6418,"I don't really think most liberal democracies did a great job, and we need to learn a lot from ROK/ROC, but is it really to emulate one of the most dystopian and authoritarian regimes in the world today?"
6419,"Everything is a balance, and rights will matter long after COVID is endemic and managed."
6420,Sometimes it's just appropriate to follow the rules.
6421,good meme
6422,"The mix-and-match study was small (50 subjects per combination) and was not structured to provide well-controlled comparisons (among other things, different pairings ended up with different distributions of intervals between doses)."
6423,The single-vendor studies were larger (but not that much larger); general CDC/FDA conservatism (staying as close to the center of what's been well tested) resulted in a preference for using the same vaccine for primary series and booster.
6424,"At this point, why even follow all of the rules?"
6425,You don't get much out of it.
6426,"From what I've seen this entire pandemic, public health messaging and rules have always been a step behind this virus."
6427,We're always acting too late.
6428,My husband is hesitant so we're waiting.
6429,"The initial study wasn't large enough to identify the more rare adverse events, but we should know them and have a solid idea on incidence in December."
6430,"My daughter also had covid already, so I'll have to look into how that affects things."
6431,I wouldn't be surprised if there are quite a few parents who are waiting for the early birds to get fully vaccinated and see how that goes.
6432,"I'm personally not overly worried about AEs and expect her to get the shot in January, but I don't feel terribly pressured when we had covid just a few months ago anyway."
6433,It'll be nice to not have to quarantine after school exposures though.
6434,I think anyone who doesn't start by January is pretty unlikely to willingly get it at all though.
6435,"Compared to the Black Plague in Medieval Europe (*killed 30-60% of Europe‚Äôs total pop*) COVID‚Äôs toll (killed perhaps .33% of total US pop) is mild, even without vaccines."
6436,"It is hard to say how bad it would have been back then before clean drinking water, adequate nutrition, etc."
6437,"But when we get a pandemic with a death toll like the Black Death of the Middle Ages, it will be really fukin‚Äô scary."
6438,I know.
6439,We'll see.
6440,It will be very interesting 15 days.
6441,"Lotta societies would care enough about their kids that they could at least skip the grift in the middle of a deadly pandemic, is all I'm saying."
6442,"Not us, though."

6445,"Israel's case rate has stayed pretty low after a mass boosting campaign, and it seems like the third shot has longer lasting protection, so there's a decent chance that if you boosted well enough you could locally eradicate COVID or at least get it down to low numbers"
6446,"Yes, but fixing climate change without changing habitat destruction and fishing practices won't automatically improve biodiversity."
6447,Come on now.
6448,And then you watch the school board meeting madness over masking and think- is community input into public education actually a good thing?
6449,It seems necessary but would also hold us back.
6450,Glad my username literally means boosted.
6451,"Yup, people here really struggle to accept the fact that our understanding of the virus, like many things, is *evolving*."
6452,"And there‚Äôs stuff we don‚Äôt yet understand, but we are working towards it."
6453,Some redditors can be really naive when they think about scitech.
6454,This is a post by a moderator.
6455,And it doesn't look deleted to me
6456,"Yeah it disgusts me that folks are trying to pull this shit, if your religion or fringe interpretation of it doesn't see life as important to protect what's even the point?"
6457,Maybe they have a better chance when there are more beds available in the hospital.
6458,Many people around here have had breakthrough infections after two doses.
6459,"Disease severity is a few times lower than without vaccination, but in older people it is still really bad news."
6460,"You are probably just as contagious before symptoms show, but will fight it off much faster than without vaccination."
6461,"If this ends up not being Covid, get your third dose."
6462,Trivial infections are no reason to stop vaccinating.
6463,"This is one of the so called false contraindications, the following is a guide from german RKI:

Should vaccinations be given despite other illnesses?"
6464,Often indicated vaccinations are not given because certain circumstances are mistakenly viewed as contraindications.
6465,"It is known from surveys and studies that one of the main reasons for low vaccination coverage is these contraindications, which are often misunderstood by doctors and used improperly."
6466,"It should therefore be pointed out again, especially in this context, that common infections, even if they are associated with subfebrile temperatures (‚â§ 38.5 ¬∞ C = 101.3 F), are not a contraindication to vaccination."
6467,Other false contraindications are e.g .
6468,":

A possible contact of the vaccinee to people with infectious diseases,

Family seizures

Febrile convulsions in the anamnesis of the vaccinee (since febrile vaccination reactions can provoke a seizure, consideration should be given to giving antipyretic drugs to children with a tendency to convulsions: e.g."
6469,"in the case of dead vaccines at the time of vaccination and 4 and 8 hours after vaccination as well as in the case of the MMR vaccination between 7th and 12th day in the event of a temperature increase),

Eczema,

Dermatoses,

localized skin infections,

Treatment with antibiotics or with low doses of corticosteroids or topical steroid-containing preparations,

Pregnancy of the mother of the vaccinee,

congenital or acquired immunodeficiencies when vaccinated with dead vaccines,

Neonatal jaundice,

Prematurity: premature babies should be vaccinated according to the recommended vaccination age regardless of their birth weight,

chronic illnesses as well
non-progressive diseases of the CNS."
6470,"Indicated vaccinations should be carried out in particular in people with chronic diseases, since these people are particularly at risk due to the severe course and complications of vaccine-preventable diseases."
6471,People with chronic diseases should be educated about the benefits of the vaccination compared to the risk of the disease.
6472,There is no reliable knowledge that any flare-ups occurring at the same time as the vaccination could be caused by a vaccination.
6473,https://www.rki.de/SharedDocs/FAQ/Impfen/AllgFr_Kontraindi/FAQ04.html
6474,That is actually even a known problem with poor cognitive function.

6476,Ugh
6477,Then you open your eyes and unplug your ears to realize there‚Äôs actually no building on fire.
6478,The issue with Delta isn't that your immune system doesn't recognize it.
6479,"It's that Delta just very, very rapidly multiplies in the mucus membranes and brute force overwhelms your immune system."
6480,"&gt; You really overestimate the public's ability to take in all this data and be able to understand it as it changes literally day to day

Yet the public is still OBSESSED with it."

6493,"The NIH study also used a full dose of Moderna, and it showed the Moderna booster increasing antibodies by 17.3x vs. Pfizer's 14.9x."
6494,Not terribly significant.
6495,Singapore's health ministry says that getting a Moderna booster after receiving Pfizer in your initial series decreases infection risk by 72% vs. 62% if you just get another Pfizer dose.
6496,Not sure if they used a full or half dose of Moderna.
6497,"Basically, we need more data."

6515,Moderna is a bigger dose that gives more immunity but many more side effects.
6516,The booster is smaller but still a bigger dose than Pfizer.

6518,Otherwise it's up to you and really doesn't matter.
6519,The third dose is incredibly effective regardless and side effects are almost all short lived.
6520,The performance of both vaccines is very close.
6521,"The initial studies reported slightly better results for Pfizer, new ones report Moderna is slightly better now (maybe Delta, maybe it keeps immunity better)."
6522,"The differences are a couple of percentage points, so chances are, they don't really matter ;)

6549,"Well, we obviously don‚Äôt know the true outcome, so we have no way knowing what the true bias (the difference between the outcome of the study and the true risk ratio) would be."
6550,What they did instead was use a tool that let them estimate how severely biased a study was at risk of being.
6551,"So again, they‚Äôre not actually saying that a study has medium bias, they‚Äôre saying that a study has the potential to have medium bias, likely based off the differences between the study population and the reference population."
6552,"In this case, when they say a study is at low risk of bias, that‚Äôs great to hear, because that is the best possible outcome we can get for a study."
6553,"(The only way to get a study with no risk of bias would be to literally include every person in the reference population - here, the entire US - into a trial."
6554,This is obviously infeasible.)
6555,"It also looks like they included eight studies, not just the ones with low risk of bias, for most of the outcomes and did their best to correct for bias."
6556,The only one where they did only include three studies was for hand washing and they were very upfront about their sample size being to small to give them conclusive results for that.
6557,"I mean, would it obviously be better if they could have incorporated more studies?"
6558,"For sure, but that‚Äôs the risk you run when you‚Äôre trying to do a meta-analysis - you need very similar studies (in terms of both protocol and inclusion/exclusion criteria) if you actually want to get usable results out of it."
6559,&gt; Your immune system never maintains antibodies.
6560,That's not how it works.
6561,The memory B and T cells retain the coding to remake the antibodies again when needed.
6562,&gt; If your immune system kept your blood full of antibodies for all the viruses ever encountered your blood would flow like molasses.
6563,That's not really true.
6564,"While it varies from disease to disease and exposure to exposure, there are many circulating antibodies that are maintained for extended periods, especially in response to vaccination."

6567,"Besides the fact that nobody at local Cvs‚Äôs is even asking anyway, the requirements for the booster are things like being overweight and having mental health issues."
6568,"What, is the doctor gonna ask to see your lexapro prescription?"
6569,Anyone can go get a booster without problem right now.

6573,At one point the interim president was a pipe smoker.
6574,"All of these people passed a basic stats course, a pathology course, an anatomy class and two units of pathology."
6575,They knew how bad it was to smoke... And yet...
6576,I also know a lot of them were conservative in a rather liberal area.
6577,I can totally understand the combination of brain washing from conservative media combined with cognitive dissonance separating their schooling from their personal life choice allowing a fairly educated health care worker to smoke and not get the Covid vaccine.
6578,I'm really interested to see the vaccination rate comparison between Covid and annual flu vaccines.
6579,"My moderna booster hit me harder than my 2nd dose

I had gotten the third on Saturday, just in case, thinking Sunday was going to cover me."
6580,It did not.
6581,"Luckily, my job has a way for the supervisor to enter a paid day that doesn‚Äôt use my pto."

6585,"It really sucked last holiday season, having gallbladder attacks every few weeks and knowing it wasn‚Äôt safe to be treated, even if there was a bed."
6586,It ended in emergency surgery for me but thankfully about a month after I was vaccinated since my high risk self got in so early.
6587,But I think of my elderly in-laws bringing over their unvaccinated grandson who is 16 and refuses it and I‚Äôm just waiting for the day we hear he exposed them.
6588,They‚Äôre vaccinated but stupid and still don‚Äôt realize Covid is airborne.

6602,"No, but that's the stupid motivation that the agencies have for not doing the obvious thing and recommending the shots for everyone."
6603,There is no reason to give a shit about what antivaxxers think anymore.
6604,Forget about people who haven't gotten the shot.
6605,They're not going to be convinced.
6606,"FWIW, I once read that the delta variant was so much more virulent because it had more spikes, i.e."
6607,"more ""hands"" to grab onto us."

6614,It's basically true in the US.
6615,"I once paid $45,131,560.38 to visit the ER just for them to give me one Advil pill and tell me to go home."
6616,If you had two doses separated by many months you are highly protected for the next few months.
6617,After that we really don't know.
6618,It's probably not as highly protected as someone who had a larger first-set of doses plus the same booster.
6619,"But getting two boosters in close succession does nothing, either."
6620,There is solid evidence that vectored vaccines make the best first dose (they generate more T-cell response).
6621,"You glossed over having had COVID, but that gives a higher level of immunity than another vaccine dose."
6622,"With infection + the booster shot alone you have what the other reply (and some news sources) describe as ""super immunity""."
6623,"It really sucks, like I don‚Äôt deserve to be able to get groceries or go to my pharmacy for medicines because some people don‚Äôt like masks."
6624,I‚Äôm 16 years out from chemo but it damaged my heart and lungs enough that I can‚Äôt risk getting it.
6625,I relied on my husband to shop and do everything for me but now his brother died of Covid (unvaccinated) and so I can barely get him out of bed some days and we need to eat.
6626,I‚Äôve relied on Target curbside a lot but with supply chain issues it gets harder and harder to get things.
6627,My insurance sucks so half the time I have to go inside at the pharmacy to handle issues rather than use the drive thru.
6628,I really don‚Äôt want my cause of death to be ‚Äúshe needed lettuce but she died because everyone else was an uncaring asshole‚Äù but I can‚Äôt guarantee that won‚Äôt happen.
6629,The people that already do it... get it.

6638,"In general, to generate memory T cells with high proliferative potential and memory B cells that have to go through the germinal center reaction and take several months to develop, it is better to have an interval of at least 2‚Äì3 months between the prime and the boost \[42\]...."
6639,Recent studies have also suggested that increasing the time intervals between immunizations during a prime‚Äìboost protocol may permit increased differentiation of effector memory cells to central memory cells before boosting and thereby enhance the effectiveness of the immunizations \[17\].
6640,"From what I remember from high school biology, when the immune system sees a new pathogen, the B cells (which make antibodies) rapidly mutate in order to produce cells make the best antibodies for the pathogen."
6641,"Spacing out the doses might give the cells time to make better antibodies, and the booster triggers the immune system to make more antibodies in general."

6648,She bitched and moaned about it but she got it.
6649,The Vax and booster don't necessarily stop you from getting covid.
6650,They make it less likely to get it but more importantly they significantly reduce the occurrence of severe symptoms.
6651,They reduce hospitalizations significantly.
6652,Nurse's aren't really trained well on immunology.
6653,There's some very basic pharm at the ADN level and some very glossed over pathophysiology at the BSN level.
6654,"&gt; But on that topic the vaccines fully disclaim there's no evidence that it's safe for pregnant women, or that it doesn't effect fertility in either men or women."

6656,Are you offering to provide negative-proof?
6657,"I'm not being sassy, I'm trying to clarify."

6679,I just got my kid an appointment this weekend.
6680,I ended up scheduling it in the next county over because being a more conservative area their schedule was ridiculously wide open.
6681,No where in my area had any availability for the whole month.
6682,"i mean if you get all the boosters, eat whole foods, and exercise, covid will hardly be a unique threat until you‚Äôre elderly, when everything a threat

getting 2 shots was already twice as protective from death as not smoking."
6683,"we need to fix food, transportation, and time consumption habits to prevent covid"
6684,"People don't often have them, and many are fake."
6685,Problem is there is no uniformity with the cards.
6686,"My wife and both of our grown sons are vaccinated, and all of our cards are different."
6687,"I don't think we have that kind of data yet, but the data is pretty clear that hybrid immunity is awesome and you should definitely have no concern about your level of immunity right now."

6691,Cool.
6692,Thanks for the link.
6693,"Guess it makes sense that vaccinated people are hospitalized for a shorter period of time, so even if they're 1 in 3 hospital admissions, they're only 1 in 4 hospital beds."
6694,"Still, 1 in 4 is still not something that can be ignored, especially as we enter flu season."
6695,Jesus are people not actually looking at the Vax cards?

6700,"Probably more, but we don't know for sure."
6701,"If you were infected and got a single vaccine dose, the amount of protection (both measurable immunity and all attempts to measure efficacy) is extremely high."
6702,The second dose at +1 month then contributes nothing more (to measurable immunity).
6703,We don't know if there's benefit to getting another dose 6+ months after the original one.

6720,Do not recommend.
6721,Was terrible.
6722,Deer Valley Unified for sure because I still have the email.
6723,And then once my daughter got the shot the nurse told me other districts did it too.
6724,Not sure which
6725,"I appreciate the condolences, but I was being paid a shit-ton of money to be there."
6726,It's all good.
6727,I usually whore myself out to the highest bidder.
6728,"First we needed group immunity by 70 percent catching the virus, then 2 shots would be sufficient."
6729,Now 3 is the charm.
6730,We have 87 percent vax rate in the netherlands(including myself) and the highest covid cases ever.
6731,Vaccins reduce hospital cases and deaths but Hardly changes transmission.
6732,I don't understand how people and governments in general don't understand this by now.
6733,"Hey man, I didn't come here to get depressed."
6734,Just give us reassuring platitudes and punch Goro in the balls.
6735,Which academic journals are you looking at in particular?

6737,"Edit : if I told you people should wash their hands after they poop, would you start looking for the other side of that debate and consider it an equally valid position?"
6738,That‚Äôs what they said but the CDPH website still won‚Äôt let me schedule an appointment because I‚Äôm not over 65 or high-risk.
6739,I‚Äôm considering lying‚Ä¶do they have any way to check?
6740,Same.
6741,I know logically that the progress toward normalcy isn‚Äôt going to be linear or predictable.

6743,"The booster absolutely kicked my ass, 28F pretty healthy school teacher."
6744,I had body aches in my fingers.
6745,Worst I‚Äôve felt in a long time.
6746,"Still better than potentially getting Covid, and having to deal with long Covid."
6747,Colorado provides the raw number of hospitalizations and [breaks them down by vaccination status.

**82% of current hospitalizations are among unvaccinated**, so unboosted definitely aren‚Äôt taking up 1/3 of the beds."
6749,Combined with lower chances of spread among vaccinated (4.3x less likely to catch Covid if your vaccinated) and this definitely still a pandemic of the unvaccinated.
6750,we're not quite to the holidays yet.
6751,I just don't think there is a ton of enthusiasm just yet for the vaccine in this age range.

6818,Guano has been collected for fertilizing fields in different parts of the world for many years.
6819,I have never heard about a virus originating from this activity.
6820,I strongly believe that the virus originated in one of China's wild animal farms where wild animals (as opposed to domesticated animals) are kept under cramped conditions in cages very different from their natural habitat.
6821,The Chinese government promoted the cultivation of wild animals to increase prosperity in rural regions and to narrow the wealth gap with the cities.
6822,Wild and rare animals fetch a higher price than domesticated animals.
6823,Wealthy Chinese are willing to pay a high price for the kick of getting some exotic dish which is supposed to have some special health effects.
6824,The stress wild animals experience in these unnatural surroundings can explain diseases and the cramped conditions make sure that infectious diseases are transmitted.

6840,The Delta pandemic doesn't magically end when you give third doses to 60-year olds.

6876,"It's also the holidays which are a logistically complicated time of year with kids under 12 so I imagine there are eager, yet over scheduled, parents out there as well."
6877,I think it really is to save face.
6878,Like saying ‚Äúhey we are doing something!‚Äù Doesn‚Äôt matter if it works or not.
6879,"Sure, but 1 doses do little to prevent transmission."
6880,Even two doses only provides a small short-term protection against transmission (given a breakthrough) and some medium-term protection against infection.
6881,You need 3 doses in the young to protect the elderly.
6882,"But if you only have enough to give a 2nd dose to an elderly person or a 1st dose to a healthy young person, the elderly person will benefit much more from getting the shot directly."
6883,And having their elderly friends get their 2nd and 3rd doses as well.

6896,Masks in public places will probably have to be the norm until we are able to reach the point where hospitalizations remain plateaued even as restrictions are lifted.
6897,"&gt;Current hospitalizations per 100k unvaccinated: 44.7  
&gt;  
&gt;Current hospitalizations per 100k vaccinated: 4.5."
6898,The data still shows one path to be safer (but not perfect).
6899,The other path is not remotely safe.

6908,I was boosted with Phizer after getting Moderna last winter and had very mild symptoms.
6909,I absolutely could have worked the next day but took advatage of the fact we can't report with any symptims however mild even the day after innoculation and had a lovely day off.
6910,I'm afraid this third shot is going to be a problem.
6911,Even people who have taken it seriously so far are over it.
6912,Motb
6913,But my fear is that it will get worse slowly enough that people by-and-large don't notice that much and the fear doesn't get acute enough to motivate *actual* changes until it's too late.
6914,And for us vaccinated.
6915,You can go ahead and stop‚Ä¶
6916,The same did it on a Sunday.
6917,Did all my Sunday chores and expected to have a bad reaction.
6918,"Instead, I felt great."
6919,I swear it knocked me out of the funk the flu shot put me in a few days earlier.
6920,"Honestly, it's likely to be a very moot point very shortly."
6921,"Right now, however, the local experts near me are saying past 6 months you should be boosted."
6922,Fauci has said on a national level everyone will need boosters.
6923,My state is now saying get your booster for everyone past 6 months.
6924,I hear plenty of experts supporting boosters.
6925,"At the very least, past 6 months, remask in public."
6926,"You still aren't likely to get a serious illness, but you likely are more susceptible to catching it again."

6931,Thanks.
6932,I will read them.
6933,This might explain how South Africa is controlling our wave so well.
6934,Go check our stats.
6935,3 perfect waves.
6936,Your getting a booster is very unlikely to change anything for them.
6937,It isn't a supply issue so much as a funding and logistics issue.
6938,My wife and I ran out once we were eligible for ourselves.
6939,The risk of the unknowns just seem less concerning with us.
6940,"Not to mention the risk of a bad outcome is much higher, even though we're healthy and (relatively) young."
6941,"We discussed getting our son vaccinated and we definitely will but just more comfortable giving it a few months to see how it goes, all things considered."
6942,Which districts?
6943,Haven't heard about it in Tucson.
6944,Up in phoenix i can see it happening.
6945,[deleted]
6946,Same.
6947,Can‚Äôt book an appointment for a month.
6948,&gt;The article notes that the gap in hospitalization rate between vaccinated and unvaccinated people is smaller for older patients.
6949,"Also, vaccinated people are overrepresented in the data, since everyone brought in even for something else is tested."
6950,You can go to the ICU for something else yet have an asymptomatic case of COVID.
6951,"I would not say 'overrepresented', but represented correctly unlike somewhere that only tests symptomatic."
6952,You might want to read about the errors in that report.
6953,The paper and the article describe them.
6954,"With that logic, they shouldn't be swimming in the first place."
6955,They might drown.
6956,"&gt; It will be as inconvenient as a temporary flu, with no meaningful threat of hospitalization and death."
6957,"my real hope is that, if you catch it soon enough and take the meds, you will be able to halt the damage to the cells/nerves in the nose and also any organ damage."
6958,I'm as concerned about that as I am about hospitalization and death because you can still get left with life-long issues potentially even with a mild case.
6959,"So if these pills can help to decrease the chances of things like long covid etc even with mild cases, then what you're saying about the true end of the pandemic will be for sure."
6960,"Because the reality is a majority of people won't be hospitalized or die anyway, most are left with rolling the dice on weird post-covid symptoms that linger."
6961,Really have my fingers crossed for this treatment.
6962,Go look at Ireland's numbers.
6963,While deaths are not as high as during the peak they are rising significantly.
6964,Same.
6965,I had a moderna booster and felt no side effects.
6966,Had a stronger reaction to the second shot than to the third.
6967,You explained it perfectly.
6968,Ohio's worse.
6969,I can only worry about my own kids at this point.
6970,I know many anti vaxx parents.
6971,"if their children get sick,  nothing I can do about it."
6972,My kids are protected.

6975,I still get a Tetanus booster every decade.
6976,"I‚Äôm not crazy about that term either but it doesn‚Äôt bother me quite as much, but that‚Äôs probably because it‚Äôs the phrase I grew up hearing."
6977,"None of this matters in the grand scheme of things, just one of those things that make me roll my eyes."
6978,Life goes on.
6979,Unfortunately I can't.
6980,"This is exactly where I was at with it, but we did get my daughter vaccinated as soon as she could get in."
6981,And just yesterday we found out that her teacher (vaccinated) had tested positive for covid.
6982,"I'm definitely glad we at least had a week head start on the first dose, but that cautionary pull to ""wait and see"" is so strong."
6983,"I'm frustrated and sick of it, but I do understand some of the hesitancy especially at the beginning."
6984,"I think part of it, at least for myself, is how much fear they place  on pregnant mothers just in general."
6985,"There's a huge list of things you can and can't eat, or can and can't do (even baths are a risk while pregnant üòë)."
6986,So right from the start there's this external pressure to fear doing something wrong that will affect your child.
6987,"My fear of covid won out over fear of the vaccine, but I do understand how some parents might want to split the difference by waiting to see how it goes."
6988,My kids pretty much were first in line.
6989,Went the Wednesday the opened it to everyone.
6990,Their 2nd is coming up next Wednesday.
6991,Feels much better now that they got some protection while in school.
6992,Both of them were excited to get it and had absolutely zero side effects.
6993,Not even a sore arm.
6994,[deleted]
6995,Ah gotcha.
6996,You Could try somewhere else close by that might not be as strict.

6999,Stop trying to apply logic and common sense to a political situation.
7000,It can make you sick.
7001,"No, the people I go to get shots are very strict about eligibility."
7002,"Wait, people really get $8."
7003,Not even when I first became an aide was I paid that low.
7004,This make zero sense.
7005,First person was reported to be unconnected to the market in November 2019.
7006,Did people just continuously throw shit on the wall to see what stick?
7007,No idea.
7008,A friend of me had lost his yellow book as well and got one for free.
7009,And the digital vaccination passwort was free as well.
7010,Strange.
7011,"I‚Äôm going to be going home to my family this holiday season, including my 95 year old grandfather."
7012,You bet your ass I‚Äôm using my mental illness as an excuse to get my booster.
7013,Probably.
7014,Gas prices are supply and demand so increased demand with still limited supply drives prices up.
7015,Cynically I speculate it‚Äôs related to the slowly dying oil industry trying to shore up the value of their stock before  calendar year end.
7016,I don't think that they're talking about this specific post.
7017,Same.
7018,"We do all the outdoor things, visiting with vaccinated family/friends, playdates at the park, etc, but it can be stressful navigating unknown environments (especially indoors)."
7019,I want to stop doing a risk assessment in my head everyday.
7020,Oh good.
7021,At least that way parents have an increased incentive to vaccinate their kids.
7022,"It's interesting how you assume that because someone came to a different conclusion than you did, they haven't questioned anything."
7023,"Maybe you're just wrong and not as smart as you think you are, but I hear there's some horse medicine that'll take care of that."

7031,We're watching knowledge accumulation in realtime.
7032,"The fact is, millions of lives have been saved so far even if the 2 dose protection is waning."
7033,We'll know how well 3 dose works by March.
7034,"We're hopeful that the 3rd dose leads to longer protection, but the world isn't going to end if we need a booster twice a year."
7035,"Everything considered, that we have vaccines that work as well as they do is pretty amazing."
7036,Thank you!
7037,I pay attention because it seems like all the variants are downplayed and sort of bubble along and then suddenly with some of them it goes boom!

7044,Almost 10x as many as covid sick kids in the 5-12 group.
7045,We shall see in about 4 weeks time.
7046,Keep in mind the CDC reacts to data extremely slowly.
7047,"That being said, a fever in a child is not the end of the world, just a day off school and work, but I‚Äôd rather not deal with that which is why I read the Pfizer study closely."

7049,Oh man so sorry to hear.
7050,Are you in the 18-25 range?
7051,Canada:  0%
7052,I got my booster on Monday and even though I‚Äôm 18 weeks pregnant I felt fine.
7053,I am almost concerned that I didn‚Äôt feel worse haha.
7054,Do you have a source I can read this on by any chance?
7055,[removed]
7056,"Nope, not at all."
7057,I couldn't care less about Aaron Rodgers.
7058,Was always told it was like 1/3rd of the 2nd dose...hmmm....
7059,"Wow you sound really smart, I'm happy for you."
7060,[removed]
7061,"He's making a joke about Aaron Rodgers who said he was ""immunized"" when what he meant was that he had taken some BS homeopathic remedy, not the vaccine."
7062,That's a bit bold to call itself the 'most vaccinated place in the world' when it's basically a microstate.
7063,If you had infection-&gt;vaccination it's much less likely you've caught covid.
7064,But not impossible.
7065,"""The rules"" are arbitrary and differ depending on where you live, so you're just wrong."
7066,This might be a stupid question because I'm not educated in biology or vaccines.
7067,You say your blood doesn't keep around a full set of antibodies because it thickens the too much.
7068,Spaced vaccinations trick the body into keeping the antibodies into sticking around longer than they would otherwise.
7069,What is the benefit of that?
7070,Because I also remember hearing that antibodies are only one aspect of immunity and low antibody levels does not necessarily correlate with a poor immune response.
7071,Does having more antibodies launch the immune response faster?
7072,Or more robustly?
7073,Is there any downside of tricking the body to keep the antibodies around longer?
7074,Would there be a downside if you got several vaccines all at once?
7075,I know they've said there's no problem getting a covid shot and flu shot the same day.
7076,"I've never heard it described in this way before and would like to understand a little better, if only in basic terms."
7077,Sadly I overheard today about a homeschooling group that canceled a museum visit for their students.
7078,The parents were reminded in the morning masks were required and they cancelled because of the mask requirements.

7084,"People are dumb; that's the matter of fact, unfortunate reality."

7087,I didn't even bother wasting my time explaining anything to him haha.
7088,"Must've came across these disinformation or misinformation angles with studies citing masks don't work, while conveniently leaving out the fact that they're talking about gaitors and thin cloths over peoples faces."
7089,"&amp;#x200B;

Seriously also don't understand how the loose fitting, dangling mask is a thing."
7090,"That seriously would bother, and hassle much more than just a mask that fits well."
7091,"Like I mention often, the KF94's I wear are quite comfortable actually and I forget I even have it on often, I almost want to say they feel nice when its cold out haha."
7092,"And they don't even touch your lips and mouth, so I don't ever really feel the need to adjust or mess with it once I have it on."

7094,23.000 in The Netherlands with 17m people.
7095,Yup.
7096,Completely unnecessary and harmful to the environment to boot.

7098,We're enjoying a nice reprieve right now.
7099,"Unfortunately, cases are starting to tick back up after weeks of decline."

7105,"I think the data suggests efficacy will wane slower and the antibodies are ""higher"" quality, however can't really find a definitive source on this."

7117,I quit going to the gym when they put mask mandate back.
7118,Eventually I went and tried it and I saw everyone doing the restaurant thing where they wear it in the door and then work out like normal.
7119,I‚Äôve been doing the same (there‚Äôs plenty of open space) and I don‚Äôt fear it anymore.
7120,I‚Äôm happy I still get to work out and I haven‚Äôt had so much as a sniffle after 4 months.

7126,Did you read the article?
7127,"Here‚Äôs the concern

&gt;‚ÄùThe national government must not stand by while people die because they can no longer get adequate health care,‚Äù Ms. Rendi-Wagner told a news conference in Vienna on Thursday."
7128,Deaths are a lagging indicator.
7129,"This is my theory‚Ä¶

I had a vacation planned to southern Georgia this fall so for about a month out I checked a covid site daily for transmission rates, case numbers, etc."
7130,During that month cases rose super high and at one point the county I was visiting had something nuts like 89% of their population has had covid (ever).
7131,So I think they‚Äôre in a period of temporary (?)
7132,"herd immunity due to a combo of vaccinations +
natural immunity from having covid relatively recently."
7133,Pretty sure nuking everything would be the fastest way we could bring cases down.
7134,Better than any other pharmaceutical or non-pharmaceutical measures.
7135,Of course the secondary effect of killing everyone would be undesired for most people.
7136,"After that, extreme levels of isolation seems like it could be pretty effective."
7137,"But it requires extreme authoritarianism to enforce, would have to continue near indefinitely unless also enforced on animals, and would likely cause more external harm."
7138,But it would be effective against the virus.
7139,The claim is a non-claim to begin with.
7140,There's always hidden assumptions being made with such claims.
7141,"I don't think headlines need to say ""vaccines are the best public health measure against the virus except things like extinction of all life."""
7142,"Maybe they shouldn't be making a ""best"" claim at all but rather just state what it's better than."
7143,The day it got approved children's hospitals in Denver and Colorado springs started making appointments and they were the only two places I grabbed one for my five-year-old.
7144,A few days later they opened it up to the whole state and so I made another sooner appointment at King Soopers that was last week.
7145,They'd have more deaths and hospitalisations if they didn't get their vaccines.
7146,Currently they have one person in ICU.
7147,"Gottlieb thoughts: 

""The reality is that in the near term future, the best opportunity to put more immunity into the population and protect the settings for gatherings this Thanksgiving and Christmas is boosters boosters boosters."
7148,"As I've said before, the mixed messages on if you need a booster and if you are eligible has been one of the biggest missed opportunities of this pandemic."""
7149,"""As we head into Thanksgiving, we are going to see a pickup in cases throughout the United States, from this delta wave moving into more populated parts of the country."
7150,"I do not think that this wave of infection is going to be as bad as last Winter was."""
7151,"""If I was vaccinated with my second shot 6-8 months ago, and I have not gotten a booster shot yet, I would not feel comfortable in an indoor event setting."
7152,"We need to approve booster eligibility for all adults as soon as possible, and we need all of the American  people who are currently eligible to seek them out right away."""
7153,"Yes, we want them to require a booster too and not to allow the unvaccinated to get around them by doing a test."
7154,[removed]
7155,"Yes, the funny thing is our government tries to ""copy"" your and German anticovid restrictions so they look they do something, even though Austria is fucked almost the same lmao
Yeah and they cant even copy well."
7156,It mutates fast enough to become one of the most infectious diseases in history in just over a year.
7157,"The vaccines themselves seem to be the issue here though, not the virus."
7158,We need a different mechanism or delivery so they can be more effective for longer.
7159,I want to never be required to wear a mask ever again.
7160,And I want international travel to return as normal.
7161,I want to fly without having to deal with the fucking masks.
7162,"Whatever it takes for those things happen, I do not care."
7163,"If we can‚Äôt just move on without requiring vax cards, fine."
7164,"But once you show your vaccine to get in somewhere, there should be no more masks."
7165,It has nothing to do with cardio.
7166,It's more basic than that.
7167,"It's about your cellular health, which can be affected by many different variables."
7168,Cardio doesn't have much to do with cellular health.
7169,"However, cardio is very important, and you should do it lol."
7170,"Also, only certain adults could get it."

7177,Yep indeed.
7178,"I think that has worked for non-pandemic situations like approving the latest whateverinyoumab injection for atopic dermatitis, but for a pandemic, being a day late and a dollar short is basically losing and failing to get ahead of an exponential curve."
7179,Yeah that was weird.
7180,Why is my armpit so sore?
7181,I guess it's the same in most European countries.
7182,$700 is pretty dang cheap compared to the cost of an ICU stay.
7183,I wish I got some  immune feedback.
7184,3 doses and not even a yawn.
7185,I'm planning to read it in more depth later today after work.
7186,I posted the study in another reply in this thread if you wanted to read for yourself though!
7187,So you want to show a vaccine card every time you go somewhere for a shot that‚Äôs basically become the flu shot and if you don‚Äôt get it too bad you can‚Äôt enjoy society?
7188,I had that with my second Pfizer.
7189,Huge lymphatic swelling.
7190,There has also been several studies about people who refuse to follow restrictions like wearing masks.
7191,Results: They show psychopathic traits.
7192,So mental disorders seem to play a huge role.
7193,[removed]
7194,There is no mechanism or possibility to make COVID extinct unless we get a more effective vaccine.
7195,I am definitely worried that people will lose interest in getting a 6 month booster and we are going to have years longer of wave after wave of serious covid infections.
7196,Sadly not everyone has the ability to take a day off for something like a booster shot!
7197,"&gt;Of the city‚Äôs 3,646 COVID-19 deaths as of November 1, 2021, 51.9 percent had diabetes and 23 percent were obese."
7198,Hypertension was the most common comorbidity at 56.3 percent with heart disease at 40.1 percent and kidney disease at 25.8 percent.
7199,"I'm not saying this means you can be ""fit and fat,"" but obesity on its own is the lowest risk factor out of all the ones reported."
7200,"I'd like to know what percentage were overweight but not obese, and what percentage were healthy- or under-weight but had hypertension or diabetes."
7201,[removed]
7202,Why do I want them to go away?

7208,I notice it's more intense if I am hydrated and eating enough calories to recover from my workouts.
7209,"If you don‚Äôt test, you don‚Äôt get cases."
7210,I suspect most African countries aren‚Äôt testing or don‚Äôt have the procedures in place for proper reporting of cases.
7211,So we can‚Äôt really assume that cases or deaths are lower

7235,Wait 8-12 weeks for shot 2.
7236,Kids don‚Äôt get sick either way from covid.
7237,"The trial had like 2000 kids and 3 vaccinated kids got covid and 16 unvaccinated kids got covid, none got very sick."
7238,"That being said, about 100 kids got fevers from the second dose, some as high as 104."
7239,"This just shows the folly in pointing to whatever state/region is bad at the moment and saying ""look how awful they are!"""
7240,I was just shaking my head over the Florida talk when Delta hit them.
7241,[deleted]
7242,Right?
7243,I can‚Äôt believe the selfishness.
7244,It is easy but they have you fill out a questionnaire and people who are honest won't lie and therefore don't qualify for boosters at the federal level...even if their state is encouraging universal boosters.
7245,It is a complete mess of conflicting communications right now.
7246,"I am not aware of them doing any kind of checking after the fact on the questionnaire, but a lot of people won't lie to anyone or a healthcare provider."
7247,Have they accounted for the vaccination status?
7248,"Because if not the data could be skewed by it a lot (one group could have more vaccinated people than the other, leading to more asymptomatic cases)."
7249,I assume they accounted for age difference between the groups.
7250,"Some will for sure.. but for the more level minded, yet cautious for vax crowd, maybe being told you are going to get really sick based on your body (versus just general statistics) could be a deal maker."
7251,"There will always be those that resist because some underlying fear, belief, conspiracy.. there's really no helping them."

7354,Until letting it burn results in more variants and we are back at square 1.

7358,At least in my area being vaccinated or not doesn‚Äôt effect anything else.
7359,[removed]
7360,That assumes that the third dose does not provide more enduring protection which it likely will.
7361,Annual boosters will almost certainly end up being sufficient in the long run.
7362,"It's entirely possible that even a 3-5 year boost cycle may end up being sufficient after a 3-4 spread out dose schedule, but that is premature to say that."
7363,Those that got infected with COVID naturally and then got vaccinated after have retained abnormally high protection from infection.

7687,Some healthy people find flu shots to be out of the question.
7688,Oddly enough that was my experience too.

7780,"&gt;  Btw she spent months spreadsheeting winning lottery numbers because she thought she‚Äôd be able to figure out the pattern so good luck

The only patterns superior to others are those which minimise chances of collisions, that is, make sure that if you have a winning set that you don't have to share the pot with other people."
7781,"Avoid traditionally ""lucky"" numbers, everything up to 31 (because birth dates), things like straight lines and diagonals etc."
7782,But then I guess there's also a decent chunk of people already doing exactly that.
7783,"So, in the end: Just get actual random numbers."

7789,[removed]
7790,&gt;I still don't get why people are upset about this.
7791,If the data eventually uncovers the fact we need a frequent COVID booster...
7792,There is a not-so-small portion of the population who ended up in bed for days after their first and/or second shots (myself included).
7793,I can see why people might not be thrilled at the prospect of doing that on the regular.
7794,(Especially if it means having to set aside precious sick days.)
7795,[removed]
7796,"I‚Äôm probably doing it too (getting the booster), but do you really think it‚Äôll end the pandemic quicker?"
7797,A month ago it was already close to 60% of all Americans vaccinated and it hasn‚Äôt grown much.
7798,That sounds pretty good but the other 40% is still spreading COVID rampantly.
7799,"I might just be cynical but there‚Äôs no way we‚Äôre going back to ‚Äúnormal‚Äù unless there are forced vaccine mandates (which probably won‚Äôt happen) or the virus just wanes out and dies (which will probably take a long time, if ever)."
7800,"If only a little over a half of the population got the first few doses, imagine how few are gonna get this next one."
7801,"Sorry about your Aunt, by the way."
7802,The fact that this virus was allowed to spread so easily around the world is a huge injustice.
7803,"Another factor is that, in many jurisdictions, total populations are not known with great precision -- and since the unvaccinated population is computed as the difference between the total population and the vaccinated population, the unvaccinated population, and thus the per-capita rate of cases among the unvaccinated, cannot be known accurately."
7804,And the effect of this is amplified as more and more people are vaccinated.
7805,"Compounding this, a lot of people (especially those who can work remotely) have moved during the pandemic in ways that are likely quite hard to model, and that can also throw off counts."
7806,It's baffling to me as someone from the UK that you don't have this digitally in the US.
7807,"Over here, we just open our NHS phone app and we get a digital QR code that expires in 1 minute with a name and time stamp."
7808,"I mean...the pharma companies developing the vaccines, and now boosters, got money for development and get to bill the government for every dose."
7809,"It's in their best financial interest to vaccinate as many people as possible, and if they can do it yearly, or bi-yearly, the shareholders and lobbyists certainly wouldn't object."

7847,"ANNABERG-BUCHHOLZ, Germany ‚Äî Sven M√ºller is proudly unvaccinated."
7848,He thinks Covid vaccines are neither effective nor safe but a way to make money for pharmaceutical companies and corrupt politicians who are taking away his freedom.
7849,"Under state rules to stem coronavirus infections, he is no longer allowed to go to restaurants, to the bowling alley, to the cinema or to the hairdresser."
7850,"From next week, he will be barred from entering most shops, too."
7851,But that has only strengthened his resolve.
7852,"‚ÄúThey can‚Äôt break me,‚Äù said Mr. M√ºller, 40, a bar owner in the town of Annaberg-Buchholz, in the Ore Mountain region in the eastern state of Saxony where the vaccination rate is 44 percent ‚Äî the lowest in Germany."
7853,Mr. M√ºller personifies a problem that is as sharp in some parts of Europe as it is in the United States.
7854,"If Germany had red and blue states, Saxony would be crimson."
7855,"In places like this, pockets of unvaccinated people are driving the latest round of contagion, filling strained hospital wards, putting economic recoveries at risk and sending governments scrambling to head off a fourth wave of the pandemic."
7856,Even as studies show that vaccination is the most effective way to prevent infection ‚Äî and to avoid hospitalization or death if infected ‚Äî persuading those who are deeply skeptical of vaccines has proved all but impossible.
7857,"Instead, Western European governments are resorting increasingly to thinly veiled coercion with a mixture of mandates, inducements and punishments."
7858,"In many countries, it is working."
7859,"When President Emmanuel Macron announced in July that vaccine passports would be required to enter most social venues, France ‚Äî where anti-vaccine sentiment was strong ‚Äî was one of the least vaccinated countries in Europe."
7860,Today it has one of the highest vaccination rates in the world.
7861,Prime Minister Mario Draghi of Italy followed Mr. Macron‚Äôs lead with even tougher measures.
7862,"There, and in Spain, too, attempts by populist parties to stoke a broad-based anti-vaccine backlash have largely been snuffed out."
7863,But regional resistance against the coronavirus vaccine remains.
7864,In Central and Eastern Europe ‚Äî and in the German-speaking countries and regions bordering them ‚Äî the problem is more stubborn.
7865,"In Italy, the northern province of Bolzano ‚Äî bordering Austria and Switzerland, where 70 percent of the population is German-speaking ‚Äî has the country‚Äôs lowest vaccination rate."
7866,"Experts have linked a sharp increase in infections there to frequent exchanges with Austria, but also to a cultural inclination among the population toward homeopathy and natural cures."
7867,"‚ÄúThere is some correlation with far-right parties, but the main reason is this trust in nature,‚Äù said Patrick Franzoni, a doctor who spearheads the inoculation campaign in the province."
7868,"Especially in the Alps, he said, the German-speaking population trusts fresh air, organic produce and herbal teas more than traditional drugs."
7869,"In fact, Germany, Austria and the German-speaking region of Switzerland have the largest shares of unvaccinated populations in all of Western Europe."
7870,"About one in four people over 12 are unvaccinated, compared with about one in 10 in France and Italy and almost none in Portugal."
7871,"Sociologists say that in addition to an influential culture of alternative medicine, the vaccine resistance is fueled by a strong tradition of decentralized government that tends to feed distrust of rules imposed from the capital ‚Äî and by a far-right ecosystem that knows how to exploit both."
7872,"Opposition to vaccines, said Pia Lamberty of CeMAS, a Berlin-based research organization focused on disinformation and conspiracy theories, is in some ways the long tail of the populist nationalist movements that shook up European politics for a decade."
7873,"‚ÄúRadical anti-vaxxers are not a huge group, but it‚Äôs big enough to cause a problem in the pandemic,‚Äù Ms. Lamberty said."
7874,"‚ÄúIt shows the success of the far-right cheerleading on this issue and the failure of mainstream politicians to take it seriously enough.‚Äù

&gt;‚Ä¶"
7875,"&gt; the stats don‚Äôt support

Except that they do support getting a booster."
7876,"Against symptomatic infection, unboosted Pfizer goes from about 90% to 70% effective after six months: https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2021/11/11/science/vaccine-waning-immunity.html."
7877,"Boosters essentially complete reverse that decline: https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/news-perspective/2021/09/studies-show-good-covid-booster-effect-waning-2nd-dose-protection Unboosted protection against hospitalization and death is still high for most people, but it's showing signs of slipping too."

8211,Even if you're comparing current rates of infections and symptoms then you have to ask if different populations are being infected by AY.4 and AY.4.2 right now and all you're doing is measuring that difference (it could just be a marker for AY.4.2 taking over transmission and displacing AY.4 among younger less vaccinated people who are more likely to spread the virus right now).

8221,"My son is getting vaccinated, but our daughter is only 1."
8222,Any news or insight for when the littlest kids will be vaccinated?
8223,This right here is the correct answer.
8224,"The media always oversimplify the issue into ‚Äúwaning vaccine protection‚Äù, whereas the actual mechanics of immune response is more nuanced than that."
8225,high circulating antibodies (recently vaxxed/boosted/recovered) means any intruding viruses get stopped right away.
8226,Hence highly protective against testing positive on a PCR test.
8227,"antibodies naturally decline over time, but vaccinated people are still protected because the body will create new antibodies on demand thanks to immune memory."
8228,"As you said, the only caveat is that this process isn‚Äôt instantaneous, therefore people vaccinated months ago are relatively more prone to testing positive."
8229,"Which doesn‚Äôt mean they are more prone to ‚Äúgetting (seriously) sick‚Äù - once their immune system kicks into gear, antibodies will be produced and the body will fight the virus."
8230,There are literally billions of people who haven‚Äôt even gotten their first dose.
8231,Don‚Äôt complain.
8232,Depends I guess.
8233,If the virus is able to get through your defenses at all yes it may stimulate a big immune response once again.
8234,Not enough upvotes for bad news huh
8235,That sucks!
8236,Sorry to hear that.
8237,Pfizer is about to recommend everyone over 18 in the US gets one.

8240,"Hey, can someone explain to me why spacing vaccines out results in longer-term immunity (or link me to some info)?"
8241,I've been having trouble finding a good explanation
8242,Yep.

8245,"No system is perfect, and no vaccine is without risk."
8246,"I'm just saying it's scary as a parent to allow something that neither I, nor anyone else knows the full extent of any and all possible outcomes, to be administered to my kids."
8247,People on here that act like the vaccine is basically saline are just as deluded as the anti vax crowd.
8248,Makes sense.
8249,The most vulnerable population when the pandemic started... is still the most vulnerable when everyone is vaccinated.
8250,That they didn‚Äôt have it ready in day one is shameful and everybody involved with the MyTurn site should be investigated for such obvious failure.
8251,The difficulties I faced getting my kids their first shot are unacceptable in an area that had drive through vaccination sites six months ago.
8252,Why are they leaning on understaffed corporate pharmacies (as they usually are due to labor costs) instead of drive-through locations?
8253,"We‚Äôve literally seen better options work in the last 10 months, why is such incompetence treated as acceptable?"
8254,"Around 650,000 Americans died from heart disease in 2018."
8255,How did you go back to normal in 2019 after that happened?
8256,At this point anyone using no increase in hospitalizations or deaths when cases first start increasing has a means to dismiss the trend is simply  arguing in bad faith.
8257,It happens every single time.
8258,And every single time they are wrong.
8259,Then they go back to making the same exact arguments when the next increase in cases starts.
8260,People think they know more than Fauci.

8267,Another failure of the CDC.
8268,"We should have started boosters for everyone in August, but they wrung their hands about it until it became a bigger problem."
8269,"The vaccine could have been tweaked for Delta, but they thought it was good enough to let people get sick with ‚Äúmild‚Äù or ‚Äúmoderate‚Äù cases and continue the spread of the disease."
8270,How are we always behind the eight ball with this thing?
8271,"How is it I can predict these missteps months before they happen, when I‚Äôm not even a doctor?"
8272,Either the powers that be are tied up in conflicting authorities or they are completely incompetent.
8273,If you have a cold (negative Covid/flu) and are due to get your booster can you still go get it?
8274,Reading mixed things but half of it is no name doctors the news has found.

8282,"Yep, I boosted with Moderna after 2 Pfizer‚Äôs 48 hours ago and only my bicep feels sore."
8283,Zero other symptoms.
8284,"Part of it is that the booster is only a half dose, so that might be a factor."
8285,&gt; You are the reason we still mask after being triple boosted.
8286,It's been over a year and people still don't get it.
8287,Oh super interesting!

8289,One or two days of feeling run down vs being on a ventilator...

8291,"According to Dr. Peter McCullough (cardiologist), virus vs. vaccine incuded myocarditis are two vastly different conditions with troponin levels 10-100 times higher in patients who developed myocarditis as a result of the vaccine."
8292,Troponin is a protein that is released into the bloodstream as a result of damage to muscle cells (including the heart) and therefore serve as a marker for heart damage in bloodtests.
8293,"As for incorrect administration of the vaccine I assume you are referring to the fact that people administering the vaccine may not aspirate (meaning pulling the needle back in order to see if blood comes out or not, to prevent injecting directly into a vein)."
8294,"As far as I know aspiration is currently NOT part of the guidelines for vaccine administration so shouldn't that be a bit worrying that this hasn't been properly been figured out, if it does indeed increase the risk of adverse reactions?"
8295,"Yep, my thoughts exactly."
8296,Even twice a year imo isn't a big deal.
8297,Ventilator vs a poke and a day/two of feeling a bit tired.
8298,You have to weigh these out.

8325,Booster question.
8326,I want to make sure my plan to get the moderna booster after receiving Pfizer 1 and 2 is an informed decision.
8327,"In the US, I understanding mixing has been approved, and if I understood correctly,  the mixing study most cited where pfizer moderna is better than pfizer pfizer was before Delta or a larger dose of moderna than I'd receive."
8328,But someone more familiar with reading scientific studies than me told me that there may be some advantage to pfizer moderna related to antibodies.
8329,I'm getting overwhelmed though trying to confirm this potential advantage on my own.
8330,Do you know of data supporting pfizer 1-2 followed by moderna booster could be the better choice than full pfizer?
8331,(I'm not one of the major at-risk groups when it comes to side effects)
8332,[removed]
8333,The reason so many aren‚Äôt taking Covid seriously is b/c it wasn‚Äôt anywhere close to a population ender.
8334,"People tend to trust their own experiences when making decisions and the truth of Covid is millions of Americans have had it, tested positive for it, and had no or very mild symptoms."
8335,If we had a really bad virus people would lock down and follow mask and vaccine guidelines.
8336,"Let‚Äôs say H5N1 mutates to spread like Covid while staying as deadly, the CFR is estimated around 15-35%, Americans would 100% respond correctly b/c there would be bodies piling up in the streets in the areas that were hit first."
8337,I am not sure.
8338,I can see the argument but Fauci making this statement is mainly as a preventative measure.
8339,Waning protection is a thing and we will see an uptick of cases needing some hospitalization amongst vaccinated.
8340,"This is largely the result of, in my opnion, the ""im done with the pandemic"" mentality reaching into this population."
8341,I cant attest to a solid figure of this population but i would wager is it non zero from anecdotal evidence.
8342,And would guess it is not close to zero.
8343,I do feel we need to share with the world more as first world countries.
8344,"But I also, as I tend to study in an effort to keep myself educated on the matter, believe that we will see an uptick due to general lack of usage of known good mitigation factors, holidays, and just general seasonal aspects of winter."
8345,As we did last year.
8346,The bubonic plague kept coming back in waves for over a thousand years.

8387,Being exposed to the virus may do almost nothing.
8388,If circulating NAbs or your innate immune system destroys the virus before it gets going that isn't going to stimulate your humoral immunity much at all.
8389,"If you get very sick from the virus, then you'll get a stimulated humoral immune system if/when you recover."
8390,"That provides the best immunity, but the greatest risk."
8391,The utility of small viral exposures that don't cause much/any disease is very low.
8392,Vaccination bypasses the innate immune system and stimulates humoral memory responses directly and strongly.
8393,Because it‚Äôs an unpredictable and new disease.

8395,"Folks lived with scarlet fever, the plague and polio for centuries we are the lucky ones"

Absolutely true."
8397,The problem is that we asked ACIP to make a purely scientific judgement and they went off the rails into public policy.
8398,Nobody is taking anything away.
8399,The government has NEVER suggested a universal vaccine mandate.

8514,"&gt;The messaging was that it was confined to relatively small places and the masks would be far more useful in the hands of people trying to contain the outbreak than in the general public, who at that point had very little to worry about."

Are nursing homes still an issue?"
8539,Are schools a large part of the spread?
8540,Meat packing plants and other similar work environments?
8541,"The numbers still seem high... at the same time, it doesn't seem as if crowded sporting events with not much mask usage are turning into super spreading events (please correct me if I'm wrong)... but at the same time, isn't there generally a correlation between when a place will lift all mask mandates and a rise in cases?"
8542,"So yes, is there any idea on what is generally driving the pandemic at this point?"
8543,Thanks.
8544,Seriously just fuck religious exemptions completely.

8557,You should wear a mask in a hot steamy kitchen for 8 hours and see how comfortable you are.
8558,It‚Äôs not fair to the human beings that are food service staff.
8559,Because in the U.S you have the south where there's a lot of vaccine hesitance.
8560,These's lower numbers in these states in the U.S opens the gate for outbreaks.
8561,This is what's happening in Europe as well.
8562,Eastern Europe is doing worse because of that.
8563,"Meanwhile here in Brazil, vaccine acceptance is similar in all states, basically."
8564,"The state with more vaccination is S√£o Paulo (73% on two doses, 81% with one)."
8565,And S√£o Paulo is huge.
8566,45 million people.
8567,This basically puts the whole country number veeery down.
8568,S√£o Paulos weeks ahead of other BR states because they bought additional vaccines.
8569,"PS: Another thing to point out is that in Brazil, he dose interval between 1 and 2 second for Pfizer and AstraZeneca was 8 to 12 months, which there's solid data that this brings more protection."

8611,Not too concerned as I got my 3rd shot of Moderna and my flu shot a few weeks before as I knew I would be in a lot of situations with meals so there wouldn‚Äôt be masking going on.
8612,"To be honest, I'll admit I don't read the articles."

8615,Excellent.
8616,My teen is 5 months out now and I‚Äôm thinking it would be a good idea to get them a booster over winter break.

8635," Patents are not inalienable rights, they are bestowed by society/government in order to grant monopolies which would encourage innovation."

8639,"Instead of research and development with scientists and statisticians, we now have loophole finder lawyers and marketers."

8641,"There's a lot of spending being done, a lot of damage being done, but no progress being made."
8642,The activities of regulatory pathway manipulations are failing to move medicine forward.
8643,It's subverting the intention of the patent system in the first place.
8644,It's blocking innovation and better drugs.
8645,The balance of public good and private incentive is now fully depressed rather than evenly weighted.
8646,Very interesting.
8647,"I really wondered why it stopped where I am, since we still aren't at 50% vaxxed."

8654,Not complicated
8655,"You mean the basic research the government paid for.... 



&gt;According to aggregated data from Statista, Johnson &amp; Johnson earned one third of its pharmaceutical revenue between 2011 and 2015 (about $30 billion) from sales of Remicade ‚Äî a federally funded discovery made at New York University."
8656,"Similarly, between 2006 and 2015, Amgen derived $90 billion from the sale of Neupogen and Enbrel which were discovered by federally funded researchers at Memorial Sloane Kettering and the University of Texas."
8657,"&gt;Since 1984, patent extensions have provided well over $100 billion in extra monopoly revenue during the period of the extensions."
8658,The cholesterol-lowering statin drugs alone generated $60 billion from patent extensions and another $5 billion from pediatric extensions.
8659,For that $5 billion the government could have covered the entire cost of thestudies needed for the 200 drugs that have received the pediatric patent extension.
8660,"Instead, the pediatric extensions generated many billions in extra revenue for dozens of blockbuster drugs having annual sales of $1 to several billion per year."
8661,"http://healthaffairs.org/blog/2016/09/13/memo-to-the-president-the-pharmaceutical-monopoly-adjustment-act-of-2017/

&gt;A huge portion of those Xtandi sales have been paid by US patients and taxpayers."
8662,"The US market accounts for the majority of Xtandi revenues, with Medicare alone paying $633 million in 2015, at a rate of over $100,000 per Xtandi patient per year And, as it turns out, US taxpayers are not just this drug's biggest customer: they are the ones who funded its invention in the first place."
8663,"&gt;These drugmakers are now increasingly straddling both sides of the courtroom, too, protecting their high-price products from biosimilars - biopharmaceutical drugs with the treatment properties of medicines they seek to mimic - while simultaneously challenging rivals' patent claims."
8664,"&gt;For instance, AbbVie has sued in Delaware claiming patent protection for its arthritis drug Humira, the world's best-selling prescription medicine, until at least 2022 as it seeks to delay an Amgen replica that won U.S. approval last week."

8680,My kid got shot 1 earlier this week.
8681,"I was just in no rush to wait in line for hours, and I wanted to ensure there wasn't something to worry about."
8682,"I'll probably wait 5-6 wks for shot 2, instead of the minimum 3 wks."
8683,That's based on every single piece of data I've read saying it's better to space it out.

8694,Wearing a mask in a restaurant is just upsurd imo.
8695,"I work in a restaurant and you see people walking in with masks, then take them off, have their dinner and then leave with the masks."
8696,I mean you are sitting there with a full dining room and everyone is without a mask(for obvious reasons) what difference does it make if you put it on for the 10m you walk towards the exit?

8735,"I think the main point is that at least with COVID, we simply don't know at this point."
8736,"My understanding is that how long antibodies circulate, how quickly they diminish, and at what levels they are still protective has to do with how intense the initial exposure was, the exact mechanism of the immune response, and how many subsequent major and/or minor exposures there may be."

8754,I: is she died?
8755,him: heu no..
8756,I: vaccines work; vaccines are NOT energy shields.
8757,but the moderna booster is still 40% more dose than the pfizer original shot
8758,"Bremen: it was super easy to get a vaccine anywhere, there were tons of mobile vaccination teams around town and at events like football matches."
8759,But now everything is overcrowded with people who want a booster shot and the three vaccination centers all over the city are fully booked until the end of the year.
8760,The trucks have to turn people away because interest has skyrocketed.
8761,Maybe you're right.
8762,Maybe science should just make a decision early on and stick with it.
8763,"Because adjusting your recommendations based on new data is a sign of weakness, right?"
8764,We should still be calculating planetary orbits under the assumption that they revolve around the Earth.
8765,And we should still treat fevers with bloodletting or trepanation.
8766,To do otherwise would destroy people's faith in science!
8767,You can probably set up an appointment at a CVS and have no questions asked.

8770,The goalposts move again.
8771,Hypothetically if its all tiny and Nabs is wiping it up before it ever gets started then nothing really gets stimulated.
8772,There's no point for the body to expend any extra effort if its winning every battle.
8773,And if there's no actually infected cells then there's nothing displayed on antigen-MHC complexes for CD4+ helper T-cells to get excited about.
8774,"But you can't control the exposure dose if you're just around it and eventually if antibodies do indeed wane you would get infected by some massive exposure one day, but that carries risk of getting sick and you turn into a transmission risk at least."
8775,It is better to boost with vaccines since you don't get actually sick and don't transmit from the vaccine injection.
8776,"This is why parents and teachers still get sick quite a lot from being around little virus factories all day long, and why you should get your flu shots no matter what age you are."
8777,My brother-in-law told his workplace he was vaccinated and they believed him.
8778,"Jokes on them because he got Covid, spread it around the office and died."
8779,I would trust absolutely no one without documentation of it confirming.

8781,"We know that multivalent vaccines would measurably cut down on breakthrough cases, improve outcomes against future variants, or simply allow us to cut dose size in half to get the same result."
8782,It's an incredible missed opportunity.
8783,"We are, supposedly, running some trials on them though."
8784,"There will probably be some tipping point where everyone switches over to multivalent, just as we are seeing now with the booster guidance."
8785,"But they are only a stepwise improvement, not a game-changer like third doses are."
8786,Comparing the [50% increased neutralization after multivalent booster](https://investors.modernatx.com/static-files/c43de312-8273-4394-9a58-a7fc7d5ed098) to the [relationship between antibody titers and efficacy](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-021-01377-8) suggests they'd cut down breakthroughs by something like 25%.
8787,"This is the same order of risk reduction as treatments such as MABs, the merck pill,  dexamethasone, or maybe even ivermectin."
8788,"Unlike those, of course, they would also prevent transmission by that same amount."
8789,I‚Äôm in Missouri.
8790,Our dashboards last month in St. Louis showed 30% of the Covid patients were 2 dose vaccinated.
8791,That number has dropped to about 26% of the patients now that boosters are rolling out.
8792,We were previously very low on case counts when these stats were out but our numbers are going up.
8793,Generally we have good data each Thursday but Veterans Day last week has thrown off some of our communication about it.
8794,"Just because people aren't checking comorbidities doesn't mean that some of us aren't still trying to follow all the damn rules, no matter how inconvenient it is."
8795,It's probably more nuanced than that even.
8796,"It's probably easier for your body to stop a fairly short viral exposure (ie, passing, maybe 30 minutes in a restaurant) with less viral particles to deal with than a longer term exposure (living with someone with covid / spending a day with an infected person)."
8797,"Even with a lot of antibodies, eventually, they'd be saturated with viral particles wouldn't they and there wouldn't be as many free floating ones to bind to a constant stream of viral particles?"
8798,"Yeah, 3 days is really nothing."
8799,They all gonna be dead in 80 years.
8800,MARK MY WORDS.
8801,VACCINE BAD

8803,I agree.
8804,A few days really isn‚Äôt much of a wait actually in the grand scheme of things.
8805,It‚Äôs nice that you thought the folks giving the shots needed some extra practice but I‚Äôm pretty sure they didn‚Äôt just learn on the first day COVID shots were available.
8806,"Does the flu kill hundreds of thousands every year, even with restrictions?"

8813,This is literally why I didn't get vaccinated at first.
8814,"It wasn't that I was anti-vax, I know the vaccine works, but I didn't want the possibility of miscarrying or becoming infertile."
8815,"So I waited until I got pregnant (which happened in August), made it through first trimester, and talked to LOADS of pregnant women who promised me it was safe, in addition to 3 different doctors (my OB rotates us between 4 midwives)."
8816,I got my first dose of Moderna 2 weeks ago and my 2nd dose is early December.
8817,"I was still worried about the chance of miscarrying so I scheduled an ultrasound for the day after my first dose and everything looked great with baby, but hearing that definitely scared the shit out of me"
8818,"We didn‚Äôt have a big flashy sudden spike, just a long slow climb‚Ä¶"

8823,‚ÄúI want mask forever‚Äù
8824,The worst messaging they ever did was when they told us to get vaccinated but stay inside and wear a mask anyway.
8825,That alone made millions of people not want to get vaccinated.
8826,"Also,  there's absolutely no reason to believe a midnight curfew will have any significant impact on spread."
8827,This is the kind of thing that risks becoming counterproductive.
8828,Restrictions for restrictions sake

8838,"In one case, a guy did a joint at his girlfriend's house because he was young but stupid (yet promising) sailor; per the Old Man they put him through Mast, typed up the page 7 and let him see that we were doing it; it wasn't until he left and was properly scared shitless that the XO had us tear it up; it was just to show and just to scare the guy straight."

8846,"And especially given that we've had 6-9 months of mass rollouts and no reports of causing IBS, it's just you getting IBS."
8847,The fact that you're worried about it being from the vaccine could also be causing the IBS.

8855,People can get medical exceptions if they have a valid reason to avoid the vaccine.
8856,"But those conditions are few and far between, and the people with them typically would be even worse getting Covid so rely on everyone else getting vaccinated."

8887,Uh.
8888,Literally every doctor I've had recommends yearly flu shots.
8889,Every place I've worked have recommended it.
8890,One year my work even had a vaccine clinic even though it wasn't medical or educational work.
8891,"If you haven't been recommended the flu shot (fancy way of saying you should get it), you probably don't get out very often."
8892,[removed]
8893,So you‚Äôd rather potentially die than have 2 days of discomfort?
8894,"How, the fuck, is losing three days to vomiting, diarrhoea, night sweats and muscle pain a mild inconvenience?"
8895,How removed from regular people's reality do you have to be to think that?
8896,no we don't I 'm done with trying to understand idiots .
8897,Sorry not sorry .
8898,[removed]
8899,I'm not arguing that the rules are easy to follow.
8900,"Just explaining that they are not being followed, and even when they are, they leave plenty of gaps for spread."
8901,Your friend is still alive though?
8902,"It only reduces the chance of getting covid, doesn't eliminate."
8903,The biggest protection is not being hospitalized.
8904,"Man, remember when cases were going down when most people got vaccinated."
8905,Then the unvaccinated just had to mutate the virus into Delta.
8906,They should have said wear a mask when they knew masks were appropriate.
8907,Instead fauci and company lied.
8908,Very easily could have had millions of cloth masks made in under a week.
8909,[removed]
8910,My favorite was ‚Äúthere is no proof that vaccines reduce transmission‚Ä¶‚Äù which fueled an endless amount of misinformation and anti-vax propaganda that we‚Äôll probably never stamp out.
8911,Are they changing the availability of the booster with this too?
8912,I haven't been eligible for it.
8913,"I'm double doses, and took care of my 2 kids when they had it, without a mask."
8914,"At this point, unless a really nasty variant comes up, I'm good"
8915,I'm rooting for China to succeed.
8916,Uncontrolled spread of Covid in \~1.4 billion more people increases the probability of a nasty new variant.
8917,[removed]
8918,Same.
8919,I got mine the night before my weekend.
8920,I felt like shit the whole weekend.
8921,It was way worse than the first two.
8922,"I'm glad I got it and will do it again if need be, but that was the sickest I've been in probably 5 years."
8923,I couldn't eat anything the day after and it took me a good few days to fully get my appetite back.
8924,I'm definitely only getting boosters before weekends.
8925,It's very broad where anyone who wants one can pretty much get one.
8926,"It's just a questions you sign what you think you may need one, and that's it."
8927,At least at places like Albertsons.
8928,"i disagree, we can."
8929,if literally everyone get vaccinated.
8930,"there will still be cases, but hospitalizations would be much much lower, possibly to flu levels."
8931,"I haven't heard too much stuff about how different the duration of the effect is if you had a 3 month separation between the vaccines (I remember it was speculated that a longer separation would be better), but how about those who also got mixed shots?"
8932,"My first was Astra Zeneca, but my country decided to stop giving them to men of my age, so the second shot I got 3 months later was Pfizef."
8933,"How good/fucked am I, since their working mechanisms are already pretty different?"
8934,"I can say that the second shot was easier on me, while the first gave worse side effects."
8935,no shit .
8936,I'm just so angry at every single one of out politicians .
8937,They all knew our vaccination rate sucked .
8938,Back in July when the number  of first vaccinations started to go down  and never picked up again .
8939,Did our government do anything ?
8940,"Well , there was an election coming up so no ."
8941,We know we would need booster shots since summer too .
8942,Did we do anything to make that happen ?
8943,"Yes , we closed our vaccination centers ."
8944,So now the shit is making its way through the fan and suddenly they all look like a surprised pokemon.
8945,But even now they can't  pick the shit up from the ground  .
8946,"The CDU is back in opposition mode and suddenly finding the same things wrong they were for a  few weeks ago and the FDP (most likely part of the new government ) wants to treat vaccinated and unvaccinated people the same , doesn't want a vaccine mandate and doesn't want a lockdown ."
8947,It's like they all gave up all their responsibilities at the door to their politician's office .
8948,"This just in, not having a flu shot means you give up on life, according to a dumb idiot on Reddit whom can't deal with being wrong on the internet!"
8949,Government: Get a booster or you're a bad person.
8950,"Me, not old or immunocomprised: Okay, I'll get a booster

Government: No."
8951,The people who lied about being immunocomprised or frontline workers to get vaccines: Wow you're a bad person because you didn't get a booster.
8952,The fuck is with this sub?
8953,Are anti-vaxxers trying to infiltrate it or something?
8954,We all knew the vaccine wasn't some magic cure and the protection ran out.
8955,People acting like having to go for a booster jab instead of dying on a ventilator is just a bridge too far...
8956,I like that point of view but who gets to decide what is a benefit to society as a whole and what gets mandated?
8957,How come something can be mandated that hasn‚Äôt been found to be fully effective and many times flat out inaccurate?
8958,(eg.
8959,you can‚Äôt get covid if vaccinated).
8960,How can something be mandated in order to protect the community but evidence is constantly changing?
8961,In this case how does one‚Äôs vaccine health choices effect your health?
8962,and lastly if it‚Äôs obvious that some things are effective to mandate in order to increase the health of the community as a whole why don‚Äôt we mandate a ton of other things like no fast food or smoking that would benefit the community as a whole?
8963,(excuse the fact that these are common examples brought up by anti-vax pop but I think they add here)
8964,Definitely lower risk.
8965,My concern is still that people with kids might still be getting exposed.
8966,[removed]
8967,You realize most people don't get the flu shot every year right?
8968,I never have and the last time I had the flu was like 15 yrs ago
8969,[removed]
8970,"You're saying that, but that bravado is always from people entirely expecting you won't be the one on the ventilator slowly dying."
8971,"If you are unfortunate enough to be in that position, your last thoughts will ""should have just got the booster""."

8978,"Anecdotal, but I was wondering if this was one of the reasons why we never had an outbreak at my workplace,  despite working closely and in person throughout the pandemic."
8979,What we do creates dust and so we have high ceilings and excellent air filtration.
8980,"We've only had one case, with an employee who had gone to a concert."
8981,It was recently so everyone had their vaxx and about half the staff had the booster.
8982,She had no symptoms and I just sent her home for a two week vacation until she tested negative.
8983,"Given the timing,  she definitely showed up to work infected for at least a few days."
8984,No one else got it.
8985,I had everyone test 3 times.
8986,"Masks,  filtration, and vaccines work."
8987,Even if you can't distance.
8988,Masks just are not that big of a deal for me.

9000,"Personally, I felt nothing but sore/swollen lymph nodes with my 3rd Pfizer."
9001,[removed]
9002,"Yes this will most definitely be the case, just like every other ""THIS IS THE LAST ONE"" messaging we've gotten."
9003,This doesn't stop.

9005,[removed]
9006,God dude only took 2 fucking years for people to realize the most obvious fucking thing.
9007,In very pro-vax and I do have to agree here.
9008,"I travel internationally a lot so I‚Äôve had tons of extra vaccines (before a trip to Africa we got 3 or 4 in one day at the travel clinic), and I‚Äôve never had any side effects or felt anything until the covid shot."
9009,Even taking malaria pills didn‚Äôt affect me at all.
9010,"For all three covid shots mine were pretty mild and very doable, but I definitely felt them."
9011,I understand this being a consideration.
9012,Climate change is nothing compared to biodiversity collapse.
9013,In our area our pediatrician isn't offering it due to storage constraints and directed people to a chain pharmacy to get the kids vaccinated.
9014,Called the chain pharmacy to be told they aren't offering it to kids under 12 and to call the pediatrician.
9015,"Luckily the local rural hospital has been hosting kid clinics every weekend since the vaccine was approved for under 12 and every time I roll by on a weekend, they are packed."
9016,"It'll be a slower crawl this way, but we've had options and I was able to get our almost 7 year old vaccinated the first weekend it was available."
9017,that sounds irrational and uninformed to be getting medical guidance from major news reporting instead of your doctor or the CDC.
9018,Also driven by his mental/physical health where pollsters have dropped from 69% thinking he was in good health in October 2020 to 40% now.
9019,Now you can't really blame Biden because he's so old and was out of the spotlight in 2020 while they compared him to the bozo that was in office at the time.
9020,But the more he talks the more people realize he's clearly not all there.
9021,"He's the president, it's his job to navigate all the issues the country faces."
9022,The previous president was spit roasted for a global pandemic.
9023,Why shouldn't the current one have to answer for a global supply chain crunch?
9024,For what it's worth I didn't vote for either candidate because I think they're both awful.
9025,I agree.

9027,I...don't buy this..

9031,Better vax requirments than endless masks.
9032,Anything to move on from masks.
9033,"Even with that information people will still ""take their chances"" and just leave it to fate if they get sick and die."
9034,I presume it‚Äôs more the earlier guidance.
9035,"When Israel already decided for boosters, the US was still holding at the line that breakthroughs are generally mild and the vaccine protected against hospitalization strongly."
9036,But now that doesn‚Äôt seem like it is entirely accurate.
9037,A lot of this is how science changes and how long it takes to obtain solid clinical evidence but it‚Äôs hard to blame people for feeling like they are being fed information that benefits public health policy at the time rather than the information that benefits their individual protection.
9038,I would personally feel the aggressive pushing of the one shot J&amp;J to be a better example of this than the boosters but that‚Äôs for another time.
9039,"(Of course I‚Äôm not saying to stop trusting the CDC or to ‚Äúdo your own research‚Äù, I‚Äôm just saying I understand the frustrating experience of medical guidance constantly changing and trying to figure out how best to protect yourself during this pandemic)"
9040,[removed]
9041,Wouldn‚Äôt the vax have the same issue?
9042,I‚Äôm as pro ax as they come but I‚Äôd still think a vax started back when there were no variants would have the same issues.

9078, Ok so the vaccinated are over-represented then in intensive care since 90% of the population is vaccinated.
9079,Someone correct me if I'm wrong.
9080,Guessing a reason for that statistic is those who are not vaccinated in general are younger and healthier which was probably a reason for them deciding to skip the jab.

9221,I mean how many people actually get a yearly flu shot?
9222,Feel like we are pigeonholing ourselves because big brother says it's required
9223,Pharmaceutical companies are not to be trusted.

9297,"Well yeah, but like lonelysidechick mentioned, it's not exactly wallet-sized."
9298,They could have easily just made it the size of a regular health or auto insurance card.

9303,I got my J&amp;J six months ago.

9311,"_your_ doctor, while _you_ are their patient is not supposed to lie to you."
9312,"Yes, the nasal spray vaccines that raise mucosal immunity should work better to prevent infection."
9313,"But I fear that by the time one is approved, most of us would already have been infected."
9314,"This article is about the UK, but it needs to happen in the US if we are going to prevent a winter surge."
9315,It may be too late.
9316,"CDC being slow to recognize these are 3-dose vaccines will rank up there with being slow on asymptomatic spread and that most transmission is airborne rather than droplet, as the biggest mistakes of the pandemic."
9317,"""Fully vaccinated"" should mean what it sounds like rather than being a regulatory term."
9318,If we are to prevent transmission it takes 3 doses to be fully vaccinated.
9319,Any news on double vaxxed astrazenica ?
9320,A lot of people live in the midwest.
9321,It's the prairie west and mountain west that are lightly populated.
9322,"The great lakes part of the midwest includes the 5th (PA), 6th (IL), 7th (OH), and 10th (MI) most populated states."
9323,The great lakes midwest (great lakes states minus NY) have ~66m people.
9324,Add in the primary non-lake midwestern state of Iowa to hit ~69m.
9325,"It's a big land area so the midwest isn't super dense, but it definitely has a lot of people."
9326,That is more than the west coast of CA+WA+OR (~51m) plus the nearby neighbors AZ+NV (+~10m) and the Pacific states of HI+AK (+~2m) for a total of ~64m (numbers off slightly due to rounding).

9333,"It's not fool proof, but it's much better."
9334,"It's possible to get reinfected, yes, but the chances are dramatically lower."
9335,That's why the US south has such low case rates right now -- nearly everyone got infected in the last wave.
9336,Can't afford anything else I'm afraid.
9337,Now about this lump....

9380,So when exactly did we know that cloth masks were appropriate?
9381,Make sure you factor in things like the additional face-touching they cause.
9382,"We had a hunch that masks might have been appropriate, but we didn't really know whether we were dealing with droplets or aerosols, we *did* know that face touching and hand-hygiene were problematic."
9383,We *do* know now that cloth mask's main effect is to prevent others getting infected.
9384,"If you look at the statements from the CDC, they were sayiing early in February that peopel should wear masks if feeling sick."
9385,"At that point we didn't realise how long asymptomatic infectivity went on for - we thought it was likely  to be like SARS-Cov-1, flu or bird flu."

9419,"By ""limited means"" I didn't mean the very poor, just the non-wealthy."
9420,My view is influenced by where I live.
9421,I was specifically thinking about all the 20- and 30-somethings that moved back in with their parents in their hometowns.
9422,"Many of them didn't make a bunch of money and when all the fun stuff shut down and they lost their jobs or their offices closed in a switch to telecommuting, they skipped town."
9423,"Some people, especially those with children, did move to the suburbs, that was a clear trend."
9424,"However, a lot of those people were probably thinking about it already."
9425,"Many young couples live in the city until it's time to have children and then they either move before they have them or once the kids are old enough for school, mostly to Long Island or New Jersey."
9426,"I see those moves as an acceleration of an existing trend rather than as a new phenomenon, same for people moving to Hudson Valley towns."
9427,"Some of those people may move back, but they may find they can't get all of their money out of the suburban house they bought in a bidding war and that apartments and houses in the city didn't get much cheaper, if any."
9428,"It's my understanding that rent in particular has rebounded and there are a bunch of people who signed leases at reduced rates who are being hit with huge increases they can't afford, but it shouldn't come as a surprise."
9429,"There was a burst of apartments changing hands when the situation improved earlier this year, but it was mostly just compressed activity due to the market being dead for so long, not an exodus."
9430,Every apartment that was sold was purchased by someone and the market is basically back to normal.
9431,"https://www.nytimes.com/2021/07/02/realestate/manhattan-real-estate-sales.html

I've known of people who moved to the Catskills and they did it because housing is dirt cheap compared to here."
9432,I think many of them underestimated the cost in money and time of commuting into the city on those buses that leave very early in the morning and get them back home in the evening.
9433,I don't know how many people did that particular move during the pandemic because I haven't heard or read anything about it.

9470,"I know people who even forgot their vaccine card, all the person giving the shot wanted to know is what the first dose was and how long ago it was."
9471,They don't care about anything else.
9472,But SARS is a coronavirus.
9473,I was responding to OP's claim that coronavirus immunity is gone after a couple years.
9474,They aren‚Äôt new.
9475,"We‚Äôve had nasal spray influenza vaccines for around a decade, I think?"
9476,But the usual time line for vaccine approval is well over a year.
9477,It‚Äôs only with Covid that vaccine companies as well as regulatory authorities and funding agencies came together to approve a vaccine in a remarkably short time.
9478,And the nasal spray companies (or academic institutions) don‚Äôt have that kind of clout or were too far behind to begin with.
9479,Nasal vaccines also need to be live viruses capable of infecting nasal epithelial cells (although maybe there‚Äôs some new breakthroughs).
9480,Which makes development and approval slower.
9481,The flu nasal vaccine was live attenuated flu virus.
9482,"I don‚Äôt think people would be comfortable with snorting live attenuated Covid virus, what‚Äôs the risk of reversion or mutation, for example?"
9483,"People are looking into whether the AstraZeneca vaccine can be given intranasally though, since that‚Äôs a live virus."
9484,"Given the clout and pre-established ‚Äúacceptability‚Äù, that might have the best chance to reach the clinics."

9488,I got a flu shot this year for I think the first time ever.
9489,And I‚Äôm 35.
9490,Also last time I had the flu it fucked me up badly.
9491,I had a horrible cough for a month.
9492,That was back in early 2019.
9493,I just got the moderna booster and have felt great.
9494,I even bundled it with the flu shot on the same day.
9495,It‚Äôs the luck of the draw I guess ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
9496,Get that appointment booked today!
9497,I had no issues finding Moderna slots for mine last week.

9506,Right before everything shut down I had an appointment with my optometrist.
9507,"We were chatting and I said: ‚ÄúYou know, they‚Äôre saying you don‚Äôt need a mask, but the way it‚Äôs going I think it‚Äôs only a matter of time before they‚Äôre recommended for everyone.‚Äù 

He tried to argue with me and I assured him, I think masks are more necessary for healthcare staff currently so as to stop from a shortage, but they will eventually come out and ask the public to mask up."
9508,"He kept telling me no, I guess to dissuade me from buying masks???"
9509,"(spoiler: I wasn‚Äôt planning on it)

I was just trying to small talk my eye doctor and he thought I was about to start hoarding."
9510,"No my man, I just live in reality and can think critically."
9511,I can believe masks will be necessary for the public while also not being worried enough to endanger the supply chain.
9512,Don‚Äôt treat me like an idiot.

9519,"FWIW, I saw a post from a popular epidemiology page on FB (called Dear Pandemic) that covered the fact that families with 11 year olds were getting their kids shots at ‚Äòno questions asked‚Äô pharmacies."

9527,The people mostly likely are just anti vaxxers and didn't even take a single vaccine

9539,"Yeah, same... back in the days I was all in for using all of the goods medicine had to offer."
9540,This changed when my mother got sick and doctors pretty much fucked her up even more by prescribing shit ton of antibiotics.
9541,"Now I question everything that docs have to say and visit doctors only when completely necessary, at the same time trying to take care of health on my own."

9552,"The previous messaging WAS a lie, at least here in the US."
9553,"Remember the ole ""it'll be gone by Easter"" narrative?"
9554,Information about the virus and it's severity were being actively warped for political purposes at the highest levels of government.
9555,Here it is https://archive.md/FIDoc
9556,I think everyone should get boosted.
9557,Everyone.
9558,"I just don't buy the claims in the article, specifically."
9559,"&gt; it's not unreasonable for a layperson to not know what a p-value is; to be honest, three thousand people doesn't sound like it would be statistically significant to someone without an understanding of how statistics works."
9560,Agree 100% but the problem is a lot of those folks who can't be expected to understand this stuff are acting as though they know better than the people who do... And it's getting people killed.
9561,[removed]
9562,vaccination rates don't tell the whole story.
9563,"If you were fully vaxed in May and do not have a booster yet, you are at an elevated risk."
9564,You are also could become more of spreader as the initial vaccine shots effectiveness wane.
9565,Soon being fully vaccinated is going to mean 3 shots.
9566,"In science and in public policy, we frequently do say ""we do not have absolutely definitive data, but based on a long pattern of similar situation, we believe that the right course is x""

\&gt; IIRC, what they actually said was, ""at this time we don't feel that boosters will be necessary""

This isn't really true."
9567,"Many folks thought that a 3/4 week interval was too low, and we'd always need something in 6-12 months, as is the case with EVERY other vaccine such as DTAP, MMR, etc

\&gt; The virus sets the pace here, and the researchers and scientists are doing the best that they can."
9568,Ludicrous.
9569,We know how other diseases and vaccines interact.
9570,The number of non-boosted vaccines that provide long-term protection is zero.
9571,Almost every vaccine requires boosting for durable protection.
9572,COVID is not special.
9573,It is behaving like every other virus we vaccinate against.
9574,I wear masks primarily for other people.
9575,"I'm healthy and boosted and likely to get it eventually, but from my understanding he biggest benefit of mask wearing is for the benefit of others around you."
9576,And frankly it's such a small measure that will save lives.
9577,Definitely!

9589,"I got mine a few days ago so yes it is, but I think if a place has an option for both Pfizer and Moderna they usually stick with what you had originally instead of switching it up."
9590,My CVS only had Moderna so I ended up mixing.
9591,Now please please please give guidance for vaccinating 2 or 3 and up so I can at least stop living in fear that my everyday job could kill my daughter.
9592,"Yea ok, fair."
9593,Day 1 was probably a bit off.
9594,"I guess I meant more ""day 1 when it was declared a full pandemic""."
9595,100% the first months of the pandemic were... badly handled.
9596,"Certainly, there was guidance against using n95's because of supply issues."
9597,But cloth masks were suggested fairly early on by most public health experts.
9598,And social distancing was absolutely suggested from the outset of pandemic declaration.
9599,Yes.
9600,Its horrific methodology
9601,"Maybe they're not including vaccinations in the ""public health measure"" umbrella."
9602,Why are people still saying kids don't get very sick from covid?
9603,"Sure it is a lesser rate, but there's still definitely kids on vents."
9604,"Even at the lower rate, why take the chance?"
9605,Stop spreading this nonsense.
9606,This.
9607,Its extremely misleading.
9608,Not sure why it hasn't been tagged as such
9609,The weirdest shit happened.
9610,"Got my booster Tuesday and then was OK yesterday, but today is shitty."
9611,"I am tired and achy, and my left armpit (left arm got the shot) is killing me."
9612,Weird weird weird!!
9613,!
9614,"I‚Äôm in CT, and I just for my booster on Tuesday."
9615,Go to walgreens or cvs.
9616,They won‚Äôt ask you too many questions.
9617,Basically anybody qualifies.
9618,"Yes, the study says ""non-pharma""."
