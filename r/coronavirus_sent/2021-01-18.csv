3,That might be part of it.
4,"However, [hospitalizations are also down](https://covidtracking.com/data/charts/us-currently-hospitalized), which should not be subject to that kind of variation."
5,Deaths have also leveled out and should start dropping soon.
6,"The bad news of course is that we were at an all time high before the downward trend so it's still really bad out there, especially for healthcare workers."
7,"Hopefully people don't hear this news and think they can ease up on masks, etc."
8,If anything we need to double down on prevention until the vaccine rollout is complete.
9,Stay safe and keep your fingers crossed.

15,Us middle of the road people have been discussing these matters in a separate sub since late March and you all called us science deniers for articulating the exact same ideas you are now discussing.
16,"Don’t get me wrong, I’m happy that logic is making a comeback."
17,I’m just making a point that we have been out there and people have simply refused to listen because the media lumped us in with 5G Trump loving conspiracy theorists.
18,"It was impossible to say anything even slightly critical of our overzealous response to this virus in this sub, but the data has been out for a while."
19,I really hope that this becomes a lesson learned when the next crisis rolls around.
20,For what its worth it seems USA is about to see its lowest case count since November
21,"Funny story, South Korea, Taiwan, Vietnam shown the way how to contain the COVID, west countries decided not to follow it, sans few of them like Uruguay or Iceland."
22,&gt;What other explanation could there be for that?
23,Both states had a large reduction in mobility.
24,The other explanation is the obvious one.
25,The virus comes in waves.
26,North Dakota and South Dakota never really had a first or second wave.
27,This was their first big wave.
28,Just like other states that had a first large wave (e.g.
29,"New York, New Jersey, etc), they will be susceptible to another wave if vaccines aren't rolled out quick enough."
30,The serology testing in North Dakota indicates that only around 10.7% of those tested had antibodies.
31,That's nowhere near enough for herd immunity.
32,Your body had enough of your bullshit.

59,It happened in the city I live in and may have even been within the first 100 doses of that lot given those dates.
60,It happened on either the 6 or 7th - 10 people had anaphylactic reactions within the first several hours of the site opening.

80,Doesn’t hurt to take it.
81,A lot of people are deficient in it.
82,My understanding is the studies showed that the vaccinated individuals who still got COVID didn’t get severe cases.
83,"As a 34 year old who was deemed an expendable...I mean essential...worker, I’ve already given up a metric shit ton this last 10 months...

I’m not essential enough to get the vaccine though..."
84,"So basically you want me to give up anything fun as well...

Do you want people to not take it serious?"
85,Because this is why people don’t take it seriously...
86,It’s not really a symptomatic to asymptomatic ratio they were citing I think.

It’s more of, how many cases were mild enough that people didn’t bother getting tested?"
89,What’s that ratio?
90,It’s impossible to tell
91,What we rly need is 5 minute testing that can be done in the airport security line.
92,I already know two people who've gotten their first dose and this is in a country thats vaccinated way fewer people than America.
93,More people are getting vaccinated daily than getting infected.
94,At least in the US
95,It's going to be hard to forget.
96,Societies that value the inherent selfishness of libertarianism and liberal individualism over the common good of society are utterly contemptible.
97,"Sorry, population on a whole said ""screw it"" and this is the result."
98,"The majority of those currently suffering are the ones who disregarded protocol, and to the ones who tried their best and caught Covid, my condolences."
99,Stay.
100,Home.
101,There is nothing vindictive about having consequences for those who potentially expose other members of society to danger due to their carelessness or comfort.
102,"This is not a statement of anger, but a wake up call to people who are still taking the situation lightly and feel inclined to the individual over the masses."
103,Cases are only mild today because of low viral load from social distancing and mask wearing.

130,"Those people should blame the anti maskers and covid denialists, not last ditch attempts to avoid catastrophe by shutting everything down."
131,It's really as simple as that.
132,The people who're bitching and moaning about the lockdowns affecting their economic situation who never criticized antimaskers and conspiracy theorists don't deserve a lick of sympathy.
133,The article states he received the vaccine.
134,Thoughts with all those medical whistleblowers who lost their lives.
135,It was around this time i recall non state controlled warnings coming out of china.
136,There was also a wuhan resident who was able to hack their internet service and post a youtube video wanting to warn the world about how bad this virus was.
137,This was in january when most people i spoke to still didnt take it seriously.
138,"They warned us and we still let the planes in till march, its just crazy."
139,It was here in San Diego last week.
140,10 people independently had anaphylactic reactions at the same (albeit huge) vaccine distribution site within a few hours of each other.
141,"Since that is supposed to be a 1 in 100,00 event they were concerned and switched to a different lot."
142,The state is investigating that lot not the Moderna vaccine as a whole.
143,All the anaphylactic reactions were from the same lot.
144,It's Texas though.
145,Nobody gives a shit there as near as I can tell.
146,Yeah I have to agree.
147,These variants have probably been spreading since October here.

154,"No, at least the way the Pfizer trial I did offered to unblind participants early if they were phase 1A or 1B."
155,yup.
156,"Because the out going administration said ""Not my responsibility"" And pitted the states against one another for PPE's."
157,Then didn't give any money to the states to ramp up  testing.
158,Or to help get shit squared away for when the vaccine did become available.
159,But hey.
160,Seems some people have the attention span of freaking goldfish.
161,In another few days this will be the new administrations fault.
162,"Reddit actually believes China is the only country in the world that has solved Covid

165,The variants are already here
166,"Search for ""athlete heart covid"" on google"
167,How do you fix this problem without paying everyone significantly more money?

175,They took into account some but it's grown faster than the expectation.

200,"Honestly it would've been better to vaccinate state by state, starting from the smallest ones."
201,Quickly reach localized herd immunity in a given location rather than taking many months to reach it everywhere.
202,Another way to think about it is in terms of the reproductive number.
203,Let's say the reproductive number is about 5 for COVID (that's high but I'm being conservative given the more contagious variants out there).
204,The goal is to get that number down to &lt;1.
205,"Treat it like a game, where some things **increase** the reproductive number and others **decrease it**, and your goal is to ""spend your budget"" i.e."
206,"have as few restrictions as possible while still having a reproductive number &lt;1:

212,Still spreading.
213,3.
214,Widespread testing?
215,"**Divide by 2 again**, now we're at 0.6 and we could end the pandemic (if everyone followed these three things religiously)."
216,"With nothing else at our disposal, the only way to get &lt;1 is by doing all of this."
217,Bummer.
218,This is our current state.
219,Now let's imagine we vaccinate everyone.
220,"If it really is 95% effective\*, then getting everyone vaccinated could be like a **Divide by 20** step."
221,That *alone* gets us to 0.25 and could end the pandemic without any of the other steps\*\*!
222,"The problem is, what if fewer people get vaccinated?"
223,"if we only get 50% of people vaccinated, then it may be more like a **Divide by 3** step.... it's helpful, but it's not enough to get us below 1, so we might still need to combine it with another preventative **Divide by 2** step\*\*\*."

318,"It’s been an open question this entire time whether the vaccine would prevent the vaccinated person from being a carrier of the virus, even if it kept them safe from its effects."
319,"This news suggests that in addition to the vaccine protecting the vaccinated person, it’ll ALSO prevent them from transmitting the virus to others if they come in contact with a Covid-positive person."
320,The math is off.
321,"It's about 250,000 cases officially a day That's where I got to a million not a million officially."
322,There was a movie about it with Tom Hanks google it.
323,I am lucky as I was raised around a medical family.
324,So I don't have trouble communicating with drs.
325,But many people aren't that lucky.
326,So when they try to tell drs about their condition
327,"And yet there are so many people peddling the theory ""It's just a flu"" or even worse, the ""I got covid and I'm fine, it's very minor!"""
328,people.
329,Fuck them.
330,"that doesnt discount fact smokers on average are thinner, contributing to the correlation, which may or not be marginal."
331,"and doesnt explain the vegetarian correlation, which is again probably because they are in general thinner or perhaps healthier."
332,"i was aware of the ace2 receptors and remember hearing this early on during pandemic, although not much noise has been made about this."
333,"as for meat packing plants, covid has been found to stick to meat for far longer than say carboard or plastic by several times."
334,explaining the outbreaks in china from frozen foreign foods.
335,"meat packing plants are the perfect breeding ground, its cold, not much moisture, not much natural sunlight, and the workers are all packed closely together spreading infection to each other and potentially on the meat."
336,"china recently discovered it in ice cream and shut down an ice cream factory, so certain dairy products may also be a good host for the virus."
337,"This post appears to be about vaccines, please see [our FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/wiki/faq#wiki_where_can_i_find_information_about_the_mechanism_and_progress_of_vaccines.3F) for answers to frequently asked questions regarding the COVID-19 vaccines."

342,Love how you said first term to a dude who’s barely going to make it through one
343,"I swear this comment is in every other reddit thread, no matter what the topic is."
344,The Times has such solid science reporting.
345,This covers the variant in detail and explains it well with illustrations.
346,It's just a lot of states surged at the same time.
347,It's like all the other surges.
348,"Cases go up for a while in specific areas, and then they reach a peak, and then they start declining."
349,"Three weeks ago there probably was an article titled ""36 states' covid cases are on the rise"" or something similar."
350,As happens with science.
351,Eventually it narrows down to consensus.
352,"Right now, most studies suggest Vitamin D is worth it."
353,Really?
354,10-25%?
355,I’ll see a few people here and there with their mask under their nose but I haven’t seen someone without a mask entirely since like October.
356,That’s 1-2 people per 10 people without a mask entirely
357,"For every 1 million counted new cases in a day, there is an estimated 4-8 cases NOT counted, so as terrible that is, states will start seeing slowdown soon if they haven’t already due to fewer and fewer available vectors for the virus."
358,"Yep, you can see the spikes in early December (Thanksgiving), early Jan (Christmas) and mid-Jan (NYE)."
359,Do you live in Japan?
360,"There's absolutely not been proactive lockdowns, the opposite in fact (government subsidized national travel campaigns and restaurant coupons to encourage eating out until recently) and contact tracing efforts have not been very effective as only a very low percentage of people downloaded the app."
361,There is nothing mandatory like writing down your details when you enter a building.
362,"I see a lot of people conflate Taiwan, Singapore or South Korea with Japan when they consider covid response."
363,Completely different approaches.
364,"Japan has just been lucky that certain existing habits or factors were already present prior to the outbreak (mask wearing, not talking to random people especially in close quarters like trains, everyone having the BCG vaccine as infants etc., low obesity and good average health of the population) Unfortunately recently the more contagious variants of covid have caused an exponential spike in case numbers just as the general public seems to have reached a maximum point of corona fatigue."
365,"I believe the case numbers here in Japan are much, much higher, but the desperation about continuing to hold the Olympics meant testing numbers were kept deliberately low by the government."
366,Check out the average testing and you will see what I mean.
367,If I could sign a waiver and in return be able to go back to normal I would do it in a heartbeat.
368,Essentially what our federal government in Canada has done.
369,"They’ve chosen September as the month where every Canadian will have been offered a vaccine, as all 80M doses between Pfizer and Moderna will have been delivered by then."
370,"September is a decent ways out, but also not an unrealistically long projection BECAUSE it’s based on only the 2 currently approved vaccines being used."
371,"The timeline can very well speed up with AZ, J&amp;J, and Novavax, but it can 100% be met with just Pfizer and Moderna."
372,"If it speeds up, it’s a win."
373,"If it stays the same (no other vaccines get approved), it was expected."
374,That's exactly what happened to PM Abe... trying to force the Olympics during Covid.
375,What if one were to just start eating tobacco leaves?
376,"Wait, if I wrote a comment saying that Trump has lied about Covid for a full year now and his lies killed 400,000+ Americans, the mods would delete it."
377,How come propaganda articles against China are allowed on this subreddit?
378,"Statistically, children are at a low risk from COVID."
379,Low risk doesn’t mean no risk.
380,The 0-9 age group is the only age group for which COVID is less dangerous than many other common infections like influenza and RSV.
381,Public policy and health measures should reflect that reality
382,"Here, have a bag of M&amp;Ms. Only 20 of them in this bag will kill you, and only another 50 will require your leg to be amputated or lose your job or have heart problems for the rest of your life, but those are indistinguishable from the rest of the bag."
383,Dig in.
384,Aren't M&amp;Ms tasty?
385,I won't snack in fear for the rest of my life.
386,Congrats you had a mild case of covid.
387,1 million people got it and died and millions more had it worse than you.
388,Want a fucking medal?
389,Durrrrr I had a mild case of covid so no one should get the vaccine.
390,Shut the fuck up.
391,I just want the dang vaccine already
392,Those 4.5 million Palestinian you're speaking about live under the rule of the Palestinian authority (that's probably what they mean by indirect Israeli authority).
393,"The Palestinian leadership doesn't want the vaccines from Israel, they prefer to get them from other sources."
394,They're being denied the vaccine by their own leadership
395,&gt;One is a guy so in love with himself that he commissioned a victory poster back in June with his daughters shown as pulling down the covid curve.
396,"I mean, that one's less egregious than the fucking **book**."
397,I dunno what fuckwit on his comms/PR team greenlit that one.
398,What an incredible own-goal.
399,Biggest failures are China and WHO for shielding China from rightfully being blamed.
400,"""Raising hopes as Well as Chaos""

Just have to add that qualifier at the end for negativity."
401,"Reminds me of ""GDP is up, but Pandemic Rages On""."
402,This is an objectively good development.
403,Geez.
404,Many nurses are essential oil hustlers.
405,Their being a nurse helps them sell even more.
406,"That’s true, but their point is the surge won’t be as bad as the holidays."
407,"People get together for the super bowl but it’s usually with people they’re already interacting with in their area, whereas Christmas and Thanksgiving people fly across the country to see family."
408,Their might be an uptick in spread but it wouldn’t be nearly as bad
409,"Well, the vaccine has 95% efficacy."
410,If I recall people who did contract covid had mild disease.
411,"It's possible he had a very mild case, spread it, but his body got rid of it pretty fast, and he may not had even known he had it."
412,"We'll know in a few months if the vaccine decreases the spread, because we may not be at herd immunity numbers, but as we go from 10,20,30% vaccinated and above, the spread should go down."
413,"Late spring/early summer, here we come!"
414,YEAAA right...
415,"I mean, if there's none left, there's none left."
416,I so feel you on this.
417,Same experience here.
418,"Ah, gotcha."
419,"Well I don’t know if I’d say they really need to be 5-10x bigger, but in general I agree."
420,Most departments in their current state configuration aren’t equipped to do the kinds of interventions on a regular basis that we’re talking about here.
421,That's a side effect.
422,"The wifi on the microchip cancels out the 5G, so the covid can't grow."
423,Science!
424,Having said that I heard in most of the EU there won't be much in the way of large scale vaccination until May or June which means they likely won't be done until sometime in the fall if that's correct.
425,FCS football is the lower level (D1AA).
426,FBS is D1
427,"The comments here are making me optimistic, people are starting to wake up and realize that living life like this is bullshit."
428,"If everyones fed up, then the politicians cant do shit, we will overthrow their bullshit."
429,Cuomo made a lot of decisions early on that likely CAUSED New York to be hit so hard.
430,He was vehemently opposed to shutting down and closing schools until after it was way too late.
431,"I live in New Jersey and saw him every day on TV downplaying COVID and saying an outbreak like in China and then Italy was ""impossible""."
432,"Sure, he changed his tune eventually and he should get credit for that, but his early actions were terrible."
433,"Probably so, but I don't think we have enough information to say it's a majority (and in fact I think we have information to the contrary)."
434,"It's an important distinction, because people assuming most cases aren't symptomatic might lead them to be less careful."
435,Yeah if that's true that's unlikely to be sustainable for more than a month or two.
436,European countries will just start paying them more to go further ahead in the line.
437,"Yep I quit 8 years ago, never really wanted one again."
438,Last week I was like damn really want a cigarette.
439,[removed]
440,"It only completely prevents spread at BLM protests, it's simple science."
441,It’s so dumb because the WHO themselves have said that Pfizer vaccine isn’t useful for the 3rd world.
442,"Think about mandatory testing, how it is destroying education, and then you will realize they should not be there to start off with."
443,Problem solved.
444,Fear fearrrrrr
445,Pfizer is taking away vaccines from Europe to give it to Americans.
446,That won't last for long for several reasons and I expect disruptions in the pipeline.
447,Your point is exactly why I'm so mad I've been going to online University this last year.
448,No one wants to admit it but everyone knows online assessments are bullshit.
449,I feel like my degree is going to be meaningless.
450,Cute you have that much faith in the gov
451,"&gt;They would have lost access to a very important source of information, especially in the first months."
452,"China had the virus sequenced, and didn't release the data."
453,"Two weeks later we here in Au replicated the virus from our first case, sequenced it and released the data to the world."
454,It's not like China has been a treasure trove of shared knowledge.
455,"First of all it's 3.3 billion according to the official source, totally doesn't look like you're trying to push your narrative by inflating the number."
456,"Second of all, as much as this helps the Israeli military, this 3.3 billion makes up less than 1% of Israel's annual GDP."
457,Israel has a good economy with or without US aid.
458,That’s under the assumption that the Manaus story was ever really a well structured study.
459,It is going to be unlikely with JNJ as they will only have less than ten million doses available at the end of February if I recall correctly.
460,I think they're supposed to get 50 million but that's not going to happen until the end of April.
461,ultimately people will likely need a second dose of J&amp;J in the long run as well.
462,The single dose is just designed as a temporary thing to slow down the pandemic.
463,"As I said, it's important for science to find out how this all began."
464,Or do you not get that part?
465,"I expect that when the dust clears, we will conclude that good old-fashioned symptomatic people actually did most of the dirty work."
466,"The supposed 1-2 day period where this presymptomatic thing is said to happen is much shorter than the actual time with symptoms, and up until this thing, most of us wrote off mild cold/flu symptoms and take no action."
467,Um....women’s basketball isn’t a revenue sport.
468,It especially isn’t with zero tickets being sold to the games.
469,Pretty sure the schools would make money shutting out the women’s team and furloughing the coaching staff.
470,"For around 500,000 people and their loved ones, the apocalypse has happened."
471,"Yeah, real reason to be smug that it wasn't even worse."
472,[deleted]
473,I think it's going to be an uphill battle to get it done in 100 days.
474,We'll see... wouldn't be surprised if we get close.
475,1 million a day would get you 50 million in 3 months.
476,given the facts that some places have extra doses of vaccines I have some concern mostly on the demand side about getting to 2 million a day for 100 days.
477,"I dont think there is shame from wearing a mask in Japan, people have been doing it here for years."
478,"If anything, in Japan's youth and older people it seems to be laziness: they don't want to be inconvenienced by the extra effort of wearing it properly."
479,"Most of the time they could get away with not wearing it properly too, since as long as it's on your face people don't bother you even if it's wrongly put on."
480,"If it's a condition where it's made to be a formal rule though, they get the boot like this guy."
481,The Japanese don't fuck around with written rules.
482,"If J&amp;J comes alive, it may happen."
483,"But only with Pfizer and Moderna, I don't think so."
484,Haha guess someone is feeling a little defensive about the bad news.
485,Maybe you should complain to the media outlets and report only good news from China.
486,😜
487,[removed]
488,"Am I the only one that wouldnt even get tested if my wife tested positive, like what's the point?"
489,I would just assume I was also positive and just quarantine with her?
490,Very on brand for 2020 IMO
491,because they suck.
492,I had one and tested positive.
493,"after a few days, zero symptoms, took a different test and clean."
494,"Yeah, what about the people that die from the seasonal flu, did the whole country just forget that people die from illnesses every day until COVID happened?"
495,Are we just going to stay shut down until no one dies anymore?
496,Fuck this stupid bullshit give me my fucking life back
497,EVERYWHERE
498,Man I wish I’d gotten the thinness effect from smoking.
499,I do hope this is due to the nicotine and not all the other crap.
500,I quit cigs a few months ago and switched to vaping.
501,"Cuomo is a incompetent scumbag that completely fucked the covid-19 vaccine distribution, killed many in nursing homes, and now recently issuing punishments to hospitals for using the vaccine on “unqualified” people."
502,"Like heck, if medical personnel refuse to get it, give it to the civilians who want it!"
503,Or distribute it to the elderly!
504,Vaccinate the children so they can reopen schools!
505,There is no point for the vaccines to be rotting in freezers.
506,That simple
507,Cuomo gets a pass because despite being the first state with a major outbreak and the federal gov't at every step of the way harming their chances for success has been the royal PIA.
508,"Even if he does stupid shit on a daily basis, he will always get a pass mainly due to NY being the first state hit, everyone else got data on how to treat this disease and what procedures to follow."
509,We should've gotten a hint from Italy but Italy was 1-2 weeks ahead of NY in terms of disaster.
510,Even now we haven't learned.
511,Europe hasn't learned.
512,Asia hasn't learned.
513,Africa hasn't learned.
514,"The Middle East hasn't learned, North/Central/South America hasn't learned."
515,That is a shocking number.
516,"But even at a low estimate of 2,000 passing per day it is right about that 500,000 death mark."
517,I am stunned.
518,There is a good chance of that.
519,"My mom lives in LA County but my sister works for a medical provider in OC, and was able to give my mom a link before it went out to the public to get an appointment today."
520,"If we didn't have that connection, it would probably be weeks before she would have got her shot."
521,I'm not saying you have a 50/50 chance of getting covid I'm saying the test is incorrect 50% of the time.
522,So people may get a negative result but they are actually positive.
523,"But thinking they don't have covid, they would go out in public, visit friends or family, physically go in to work..."
524,Etc
525,TSA has a program where they self-test by having other agents try to get weapons and contraband through at security.
526,Their success rate on detecting handguns was about 50% across multiple instances of testing at various locations.
527,Incompetent almost doesn’t capture it
528,A LOT of colleges have cancelled spring break in order to prevent this.
529,I don’t think it’ll be a huge issue.
530,"Well, let's say you are right, nice goal, but won't happen in 100 days."
531,[deleted]
532,"When you're dealing with a highly centralised authoritarian party-state like the CCP's China, this ""local leaders bad, Beijing good"" defence of the central government doesn't work, because the body with ultimate and exclusive authority to select the local leadership you describe as incompetent is... the central government."
533,"That is the system they chose to build, and that is why they should be held accountable, even if this was primarily a local-level failure."
534,"By the way, though, there is also some [pretty strong evidence](https://apnews.com/68a9e1b91de4ffc166acd6012d82c2f9) that the Beijing leadership were key players in the initial coverup attempt."
535,One wonders why all of those leaders appear to have held on to their jobs in spite of their apparent incompetence.
536,1st or 2nd dose?
537,"I've gotten my first shot, can they cancel the 2nd?"
538,Not exactly.
539,We can achieve effective immunity or sterilizing immunity via a vaccine.
540,Effective immunity is the development of antibodies to prevent infection but you can still transmit it to others.
541,"Sterilizing immunity completely blocks infection, including asymptomatic infection."
542,10K people is nothing compared to 6 million traveling for Christmas.
543,Let's bet.
544,Remind me!
545,in 5 days.
546,It should be a case and death rate rather than an actual date
547,Actually... almost all colleges are holding classes during the time that spring break would happen.
548,"Eh, it's certainly the goal."
549,"Although sure, preventing serious complications is important too."
550,How so?
551,The Dakotas case numbers peaked in mid November.
552,Attributing the decline to the vaccine is silly.
553,"This post appears to be about vaccines, please see [our FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/wiki/faq#wiki_where_can_i_find_information_about_the_mechanism_and_progress_of_vaccines.3F) for answers to frequently asked questions regarding the COVID-19 vaccines."

558,Thank you SO very much for all you do!
559,You are very appreciated.
560,"Yeah, the contrast in response from LA to OC is stark."
561,No rules are being followed or enforced here.
562,Can I ask an honest question.
563,"In 11 months, why haven't they expanded hospitals,employe more nurses and provided ore beds."
564,I missing something ?
565,The majority of US hospitals are simply tossing out excess doses when people don't show up.
566,I stand by what this hospital did.
567,Wish that happened in New York.
568,I know Washington is doing the same cuz someone who lives in Spokane told me it was reopening there too
569,Never forget the NY safe sex during COVID guidelines
570,Same with my grandmothers
571,California is a dumpster fire of a state.
572,"Only two reasons to live there (and they are big ones, so I fully understand why people choose to live there) are the awesome weather and access to mountains and beach in the same day"
573,Utah is only reporting coronavirus deaths for people where it's the only thing or the first thing the ME lists as the cause of death.
574,"If someone dies from a heart attack while in the hospital on a ventilator w covid, they aren't a covid death that is reported in utah."
575,Trump failed America.
576,Yeah.
577,Hi.
578,I used to run marathons and now I can't even run up a hill (even without making a deal with god).
579,That's hella weird.
580,I entered the AstraZeneca trial on December 1st and got my second vaccine dose back on the 5th of this month.
581,I have to fill out a new batch of consent forms with every visit and with the most recent I was made aware that upon FDA approval we will be unblinded within the two weeks following that.
582,But I'm in Florida so maybe it's different down here?
583,It’s a lot more transparent and realistic than “two weeks to slow the spread “ if you remember how the turned out.
584,"Too bad, I'm going to use my mask evangelism as a cover for my massive social anxiety"
585,Cuomo will keep blaming Trump for any and all of his own deficiencies all the way until the pandemic ends.
586,"Trump being out of office doesn't mean he can't still be Cuomo's whipping boy for any and all wrongdoings, both actual and perceived."
587,"Wouldn't the new vaccines have to go through clinical trials again, though?"
588,Or would they be able to bypass that for some reason?
589,They will more then likely unblind us if/when the AstraZeneca vaccine gets emergency approval in the US.
590,It’s damn unethical to keep participants blind once your “selling” the product.
591,The ethical issue of going two years at risk of illness if you got the placebo was what motivated Pfizer.
592,Thanks for the TLDR.
593,"After closing 4 pop-up Ad's, I admitted defeat and stopped reading the article."
594,Because you have to weigh the economic cost.
595,More than 40% of South Dakota has been infected.
596,So they are more than halfway to herd immunity
597,"It wasn't only China and had the lockdown been two weeks prior than IRL it would have been March 8, which is concurrent with lockdowns in Italy and several days after they introduced restrictions generally."
598,South Korea had also introduced some restrictions at this point.
599,I think Sacramento should be pretty fun in summer and hopefully all the bars and clubs are able to open fully by sometime in Spring.
600,I live near and love going to Sac.
601,It is likely that all adults (US) will have had the opportunity to be vaccinated before any vaccines are approved for children under 12.
602,The communism fans have already arrived however.
603,"Criticism of CCP is seen as racism, only to discredit criticism of a communist nation"
604,The nursing home fiasco he has to bear some responsibility I agree.
605,But compared to other states and federal response then he was doing most of the things right
606,I'm in the Moderna Study.
607,"Since I didn't feel anything after the two shots, I'm pretty sure in my mind that I didn't get the vaccine."
608,In any case we will see once I'm unblinded.
609,Can't wait to hear back!
610,I'm anxious to do more and return to my normal life.
611,Can't wait for this fucking nightmare to end on Wednesday.
612,I’m not sure why you think states aren’t going to have continued restrictions but alright.
613,Vaccines work?
614,What?
615,Who would have thoght?!
616,lmao
617,They must hate that it gets made in India
618,"Shouldn't panic, but we need to emphasize slowing the spread in order to slow the rate of mutations."
619,We can only be sure the end of this will come sooner rather than later if people don't stop being cautious at the first sign of this easing.
620,We can end this by June in the developed world if we stop acting like a herd of cats and then we can help the rest of the world and put an end to the misery.
621,They are doing a great job at that /s.
622,This isn't a problem unique to the US.
623,"As others have pointed out, Covid fatigue and selfishness can be seen the world over."
624,"And even if the Biden administration imposes federal fines for not wearing masks, etc, the US may not see a change in behavior."
625,"The fine for off leash dogs in my neighborhood existed long before Covid and never stopped anyone, hence my kid getting bit in the face."
626,People are selfish when they feel disconnected from one another.
627,Lack of a sense of community is not a uniquely American affliction.
628,Japan has a habit of wearing masks that pre-dates Covid because they feel connected and responsible to one another.
629,"Now, that's not neccessarily based in humanitarian good will."
630,It's easy to feel connected to others when you're all the same ethnicity and you shame one another for not doing what is expected.
631,"The fact is that people everywhere, ethnicity aside, are perfectly capable of taking responsibility for themselves and others, whether the law tells them to or not."
632,Expecting the law to do it for them is part of the problem.
633,Here we go again.
634,States vs States vs Feds.
635,This is like the scramble for ppe at the beginning of pandemic.
636,I agree when looking through lens locked down earlier would have keep the spreading down.
637,"Though in defense of nyc mayor, if you recall last year around March, only China has undergo strict lockdown then, with critiquing from western countries about inhumanity, and there is lots of obstacle to clear with nyc business concerns as it is going to hit the economic and shops hard."
638,He was actually under pressure and scrutiny when he anounced the lock down.
639,"Chinese restaurants were hardly how it entered any country, our own conservative Prime Minister [encouraged](https://www.9news.com.au/national/coronavirus-lates-pandemic-preparations-in-australian-who-advice/f302f4bc-e75c-45bc-8d8b-b7048c172ff3) people to visit them:

&gt; ""This is about staying prepared, this is about assuring people that we have got this, we are prepared for it, so you can go to the footy, you can go out to the Chinese restaurant - in fact **I encourage you to**,"" Mr Morrison said."
640,"This message was continued through _after_ Australia declared pandemic inevitable, eg [here](https://www.abc.net.au/news/health/2020-02-28/what-coronavirus-emergency-plan-means-for-you/12010056):

&gt; ""Go down to the Chinese restaurant, go out to the football or the Grand Prix or the netball,"" he said."
641,"Although as a general rule, we haven't been playing up the racism against our own people angle nearly as much as the US - the conservative PM in fact says such racism is [not to be tolerated](https://7news.com.au/travel/coronavirus-racism-wont-be-tolerated-say-scott-morrison-and-anthony-albanese--c-691859)."
642,"I do not know of comments as late as March - by that point, restrictions were already being introduced on _all_ forms of gatherings here."
643,"State of emergency in my state was declared 15th Mar, and we'd closed our borders to the rest of Australia by the end of that month iirc."
644,&gt; But strangely most of the high density outbreaks were in Democrat ran cities.
645,There's no surprises there - the vast majority of cities _are_ lead by Democrats.
646,"Of the 50 largest cities in the US, [just 11](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_mayors_of_the_50_largest_cities_in_the_United_States) have Republican mayors."
647,"This is a common political phenomena - cities are more dependent on societal structures, infrastructure, some degree of cooperation, etc."
648,"You're more exposed to ""other people"", it all encourages views more on the left."
649,"The further you move away from others, the more ""just give me my land and stop hassling me"" becomes viable ideology."
650,"_Further_, those Republican run cities?"
651,"They're in the South, for a disease we know to have clear environmental factors, winter being worse than summer, etc."
652,"There's a massive narrative being pushed by the right, from Fox through ""new"" reddit accounts, that it's somehow a Democrat run city problem."
653,"This is a _narrative_ though, deliberately aiming to [mislead through statistics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_does_not_imply_causation), pushed from top propagandists that certainly know [_exactly_](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNineSEoxjQ) what they are doing."
654,"&gt; This doesn’t seem to be the case in Australia, it seems both sides of the isle pit differences aside during those times and the media did the same?"
655,"Although our politics is increasingly divisive, as the conservative party in charge takes leafs from the GOP playbook (from open corruption through getting-_straight_-in-to-bed with a media counterpart), like nearly all of the Western world it's not to the point where they are willing to sabotage the country to get ahead politically."
656,"At least, not to the extent of letting a pandemic in."
657,"Wrt the media, one of the really helpful things in Australia is that despite incredibly biased private print media (nearly all of it Murdoch), we still have a relatively strong public broadcaster that nearly everyone agrees at least attempts balance."
658,"It provides a reference point that other media must contest with, cannot drift too far from without looking increasingly fringe."

675,We just had 3k cases today down from 10k+ a few weeks ago.
676,Immunity is a conspiracy theory now.
677,People are already becoming less active and relying on their computer and social media for interaction.
678,We do need kids to be outside so they can properly socialize.
679,People are already becoming socially awkward with the rise of smart phones.
680,We can reasonably expect a vaccine that is 95% effective at preventing symptoms to reduce transmission to some extent.

708,Oh for sure.
709,"I spent Xmas with my parents in their early 60s, per usual."
710,I limited public interactions for the two weeks leading up to then and got a Covid test before I made the eight hour drive
711,&gt; When Operation Warp Speed was about to begin all I heard was that supply would be distributed based on population to make things fair.
712,But it hasn’t been — there are significant variations in allocation.
713,For example Oklahoma has received 10715 doses per 100k and South Carolina has received 6808 doses per 100k.
714,"The following pages show vaccine allocations broken down by state for each of the vaccines (Moderna and Pfizer):

* Moderna: https://data.cdc.gov/Vaccinations/COVID-19-Vaccine-Distribution-Allocations-by-Juris/b7pe-5nws
* Pfizer: https://data.cdc.gov/Vaccinations/COVID-19-Vaccine-Distribution-Allocations-by-Juris/saz5-9hgg

The allocations for Oklahoma and South Carolina seem to be fair based on population."
715,If you're looking at the amount of vaccines actually *received* by the states (versus *allocated* for the states) I'd imagine it may show some discrepancies due to scheduling/logistics of delivery or differences in how the states are ordering from their allocation.
716,Thanks!

755,Three days after that I was sick.
756,had a low grade fever again.
757,"Severe fatigue and body aches, cough and congestion."
758,My baby (who was also exposed) started coughing 4 days after exposure.
759,I have been tested twice.
760,Negative.
761,I am relatively young and am wondering if the first shot provided just enough protection to have a mild case and keep me from shedding the virus.
762,Still can’t figure out why I am testing negative.

922,&gt; The mayor insinuated during that interview that NY should be getting more vaccines than the rest of the states because they have the infrastructure to vaccinate more people than other states.
923,But it really depends on where the bottleneck currently is.
924,If it is in production or initial delivery (as seems likely) then its a bad argument.
925,"However, if more are being delivered than distributed to individual states because some states are slow to administer them and don't have the facilities to store them but others have run out of doses... well, then it makes sense to give more to those states vaccinating more quickly."

935,I know three people who got vaccinated so far.
936,One Pfizer.
937,Two Moderna.
938,All had arm pain to varying degrees.
939,"One Moderna was very tired the day after, but he's  older and the arm pain was keeping him up."
940,The Pfizer one was similar for both doses.
941,Then there's my 76 year old aunt with the other Moderna.
942,"Arm pain, slept like a baby, feels great."
943,"Can't go solely by her though, she shrugged off chemo like it was water, she's boss AF."
944,"But overall, none of them felt anything like being sick, even really the beginning stages, just sleepless because injection site hurt."
945,So it's possible to have the vaccine and feel pretty much nothing.
946,"You would get antibodies from a covid infection as well, so if you were in the control and didn't get vaccinated but had an asymptomatic infection you would still have antibodies."
947,A society accepting masking by choice should be the default.

1115,As for your example it’s hard to say since I don’t entirely know how Pfizer and Moderna operate.
1116,Or how my mothers trial worked in its early stages.
1117,But that normally would be probably an early indicator of success.
1118,Moving from a medical perspective and to a purely data science perspective however brings up other issues with your example.
1119,Outliers and bad data are hard to spot based on one set of data alone.
1120,This is why in the case of trials you have multiple places running the same experiment to make sure not only are initial results good results but hopefully accurate.
1121,So your example simply wouldn’t have enough information to say with a good amount of certainty that the vaccine.
1122,Since you just worked with one sample size.
1123,It could be a precursor to help find success but at that point and time until you rerun it with additional groups it’s too early to say it’s a definite success.

1166,Could be because they have warned that their is a chance that even after vaccination you can potentially still be infected and infectious the vaccine simply prevents you from becoming ill so if this ends up being true than the vaccinated ppl are most likely not taking precautions as they used to but now all will be asymptomatic spreaders if infected making it much more dangerous for those not vaccinated yet.

1302,The change of smell/taste was my ONLY symptom.
1303,"No fever, cough, headache, fatigue - nothing."
1304,I never even took a Tylenol.
1305,"Also, my loss/degradation was gradual because I never completely lost many things."
1306,"Prior to my dx, my understanding was the loss usually happens suddenly, so I wasn't sure because for two days the change was extremely subtle."
1307,One of my deodorants smelled ever so slightly metallic - the other one smelled exactly the same for a couple of days.
1308,"It took about 4 days to notice that the taste of coffee, bread, and cheese were almost gone - but never completely."
1309,"I never lost ability to fully taste sweet, salty, or vinegary things."
1310,Ketchup never changed and I put it on everything for a week!
1311,"I isolated and tested positive on the third day, and 19 days after my first symptom, I'm almost 100% back to normal."
1312,"However, my taste gets ""exhausted"" faster."
1313,"When I taste some things like cheese, the first few slices taste normal and then the intensity starts to fade to ~60% of normal."
1314,Very strange.
1315,"Sorry, they dropped a 5 on accident, it was suppose to say ""52 weeks to flatten the curve!"""
1316,"And hey, we might just make it given the dropping rates."

1319,I have a niece that works in a religiously affiliated care home (not a skilled nursing home) for old people.

1321,My niece is not licensed and has no formal training outside of what she has learned there.
1322,I had Covid.
1323,I'm not a skeptic.

1360,And it’s not like you’d be interacting with Covid patients.
1361,"And regardless, if you’re eligible for the study then it’s likely you have some potential of being in environments where being exposed to Covid is possible."
1362,I work from home with no kids and really limited possible of exposure so Id never be eligible.
1363,I would just community your concerns with the site conducting the study.
1364,And regardless you can drop out of a study at any time.

1369,No lockdowns yet still bottom half of the US in deaths and cases per capita.
1370,The death part being even more impressive when you factor in the elderly population.
1371,Not to mention the influx of tourists.
1372,"Now Florida is one of the top performing states for vaccines delivered per capita, and is the best performing large state."
1373,"The only states with better vaccines per capita than Florida right now are small states such as the Dakotas, Vermont, Maine, West Virginia and New Mexico."
1374,I think when the dust settles Florida will be viewed very favorably for their handling of this.
1375,The problem is setting to a specific month or vague target like “vulnerable people vaccinated.” We have to respond based on what we’re actually seeing.
1376,"I doubt you're looking for an actual response, but have you ever tried to emigrate as a poor person?"
1377,For the people most hurt by the lack of worker's rights they have little ability to leave.
1378,"For people who make solid incomes who could emigrate, there is little need to worry about minimum wage laws being insufficient or not having guaranteed holidays."

1532,You become exempt based on key factors of your job position.
1533,Can you make or change company policy?
1534,Do you have the ability to hire or fire employees without oversight.
1535,Typically if the answer to both these questions is no you will are non-exempt and are entitled to overtime compensation in the form of time and a half.
1536,For public companies this means it is added to your check and taxes appropriately.
1537,If you work for a government organization you are paid in comp time at time and a half.
1538,So if the company is found to be in violation of said FLSA laws at the federal level the recourse is that the company must pay you for the overtime hours you worked.

1591,It would be the same protein RNA with a couple of amino acids or nucleic bases replaced.
1592,The testing would be similar to phases 1/2 as it is done for the influenza vaccine in a matter of weeks twice a year (once for each hemisphere).
1593,"I agree, however, with your conclusion."
1594,[deleted]

1596,Idiotic.
1597,"There isn’t a point to some idiot on Reddit spouting random and baseless death projections for two years from now, but here you are anyways"
1598,He specifically mentioned relationships.
1599,"Many people are separated from their spouses and families, and would be perfectly willing to get tested before departure and to quarantine in a hotel and get tested after arrival if they were allowed to travel to be with family."
1600,"You have to read the article, headlines are misleading"
1601,Bullshit
1602,Whatever stance the person paying them most wants them to have.
1603,"There's really no ""sides"", it's just someone's general line of ethics + the hundreds of companies lining up to feed them a life supply of cash to have the same opinion as the companies, at least in America."
1604,Lobbying is just the game now.
1605,There's very little human affair left beneath.
1606,Damn I'm jealous.
1607,go get that vax!
1608,Jabs
1609,It did happen in the trial.
1610,It took 1-2 weeks after the first dose before the vaccine and placebo groups started to diverge.
1611,"Of the 50 cases in the vaccine group, 39 were before the second dose."
1612,The 95% confidence interval for the effectiveness between the first and second doses is 29.5-68.4%.
1613,You're extrapolating *the result you desire*.
1614,"Factually, this is not based on hard evidence for this particular disease/vaccine combination."
1615,That's not science.
1616,That's cherry picking for what you want to be true.
1617,"I don't know what happened in this sub today, but it seems like it really quickly switched from general optimism to total doomer in less than 24 hours"
1618,"If the variant is just as transmissible in FL as it was in the UK, combined with what seems like laxer rules in the sunshine state, then yes it definitely has the potential to be quite bad."
1619,"Makes sense, it's cheaper for the insurers and Aldi's to bribe employees to get vaccinated than pay bills for ICU hospitalizations"
1620,"If the rollout in the US is a disaster, then the rollout in most other countries is a blazing inferno of a dumpster fire."
1621,"Last I checked, France had administered 0.65 vaccines per 100 people."
1622,Not 65.
1623,Not 6.5.
1624,ZERO POINT SIX FIVE.
1625,it's infectious!
1626,"There were two different studies, by the health insurance companies of Israel, that came up with very different results (30% vs 60%)."
1627,"If we consider that *any* immune response takes some time, I still consider it plausible to assume that after two weeks the vaccine protects 50% of the vaccinated people from illness."
1628,"And that's good news, everyone."
1629,Spreading the first vaccination amongst critical groups helps to protect the health system from collapse.
1630,The second jab will then terminate this cluster fun of a pandemic.
1631,"In other words, it's exactly the sort of pro-worker behavior that we're constantly being told Europe does better than the US, but when a company does it they're still being given shit for it?"
1632,Anecdote: I used to go to Seattle for an anime convention during Easter
1633,I'm really sorry you're dealing with that.
1634,"I had a year-long serious recovery after a virus as a child, so I don't think they're a joke."
1635,"But I guess I keep reminding myself that there are lots of viruses, including coronaviruses, that circulate in the population that we don't worry about on a regular basis, even though the likelihood of serious complications exists with any of them."
1636,Our risk of illness/injury is never non-zero and it's unrealistic to expect it to be.
1637,"Once we get down to a point where hospitalizations are sustainably low, then I think it's up to our own personal comfort zones."
1638,People were expecting this to be handled like the Swine Flu pandemic after the initial round of heavy restrictions where it was a threat but mostly background noise.
1639,Flatten the curve doesn't mean end the pandemic.
1640,It ment get hospitals prepared to deal with COVID patients but instead it turned into wait for a vaccine.
1641,Nobody expected this to magically end in June but people did expect to be able to get on with normal life and deal with the risk of catching it.
1642,Not catching COVID has become life at this point and people in general are rightfully over it.
1643,Most of those are reschedule from last year and are tentative at best.
1644,For those concerts to make money they need to be sellouts and those aren't a given at the moment.
1645,"Also, my neighbor is a tech for MCR, they aren't touring this year."
1646,"One member of the Biden taskforce expressed interest in letting the developing world get priority but I guess they realized the public sentiment for another full year of this in the US isn’t there, so they’ve decided to focus on getting the US vaccinated first."
1647,It's not sterilizing immunity.
1648,They haven't proven that yet.
1649,Do you mean the first doses?
1650,Then no.
1651,But widespread distribution of the vaccines we have now will bring the pandemic to an end.
1652,"And that last 1/3 will eventually get COVID, pushing us to herd immunity no matter what."
1653,All good!
1654,birds i think.
1655,Thanks for saying this.
1656,Other workers will be working for free.
1657,The article says “fewer than ten” and then later clarifies “six”.
1658,Why you would ever write “fewer than 10” instead of just stating the number is lost on me
1659,The WHO should take a look at Manaus ASAP.
1660,Reports are a little scary... seems the new Wuhan.
1661,"From the article:

&gt;Something very different is occurring in Manaus."
1662,I don't know if it's a new variant or something.
1663,"But people in the front line is seeing an increase in the severity of the cases

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Sometimes entire families came to the hospital, with symptoms at the same time."
1664,"Previously, it was one at a time

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Clearly we are dealing with something a lot more pathogenic and transmissible

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Before, severe symptoms appeared around the 10th day."
1665,Now patients with 7 or 8 days of symptoms already have 75% of lungs compromised
1666,Clearly not since they are not recommended for anyone under 12 and students and most staff (in offices etc.)
1667,do not wear them at their desks.
1668,They have never been recommended outdoors and I see probably no more than 1% of people doing so...
1669,So when did your government react?
1670,As I said in January 23rd China was locking down a city with more than 8 million inhabitants.
1671,"In the light of that: ""The WHO did not warn us"" is no acceptable excuse for the inaction of any government."
1672,"&gt; “For the past three weeks, jurisdiction allocations have remained relatively steady around 4.3 million total doses (or just over 2 million first doses) of both Pfizer and Moderna, which has provided additional predictability,” the HHS spokesperson said."
1673,4.3 million doses a week just won't cut it.
1674,J&amp;J and AZ/Oxford EUA is critical at this point.
1675,Honestly ending obesity and smoking is easier than trying to stop COVID.
1676,"If you want to stop obesity, all actions only need to target obese people, and it's easy to see who is and isn't obese."
1677,"If you want to stop COVID, you can't easily identify who does and doesn't have it, and you need to target *everyone*."
1678,I'm not saying we should put society on hold for either of them.
1679,I'm saying there's a stupid double standard that goes on where people are totally okay with watching millions die from obesity and smoking without a care in the world.
1680,But the invisible virus that's literally impossible to control?
1681,That's the battle we choose to fight?
1682,if you can't pay someone a living wage you're admitting capitalism doesn't work.
1683,Way less.
1684,"Around 0.02%

1685,I've seen lower.
1686,Nah.
1687,All the cashiers going on 2 weeks strike would be fired instantly and replaced by the next same-amount of new cashiers right behind them.
1688,"Not supporting these companies, but that's the exact thing that happens everywhere my mom's worked."
1689,"They start treating them like shit, everyone quits, everyone gets instantaneously replaced by a new hire and then the new hire gets tired of it, quits, gets replaced..."
1690,"Yeah, hopefully something gets worked out, and soon.."
1691,Kids are lower risk but they can still carry it home.
1692,There needs to be a way to encourage those with doubt to start using masks and following precautions.
1693,"God knows a competent leader doing so in the first place could have made a major difference, they clearly would have if he'd only *told* them it was the right thing to do."
1694,I just wouldn’t be on register.
1695,"Instead, I would assist the manager in managing the employee who is supposed to be on the register."
1696,Yes and now Lidl.
1697,Tesco used to even be in California.
1698,I wonder if Lidl their new competition in the US will also do the same?
1699,I have both near me and they are both great stores.

1705,"True, but isn’t it my brain that counts?"
1706,I’m with you.

1750,I thought some of these people getting infected were prior to the “incubation” period of the vaccine like 7 days isn’t it till the body starts introducing antibodies?
1751,If that’s the case case say it’s ineffective when that’s what we’ve known for a while how this all works
1752,That sounds like the trailer for a sequel...

1758,"I was extremely risk aversive before the pandemic, and I recognized that while staying ""safe"" and never leaving my comfort zone was easy, it made my life miserable."
1759,Turns out a majority of the population doesn't realize that shutting down the world to cure your FOMO and feel safe isn't a sustainable way to live.
1760,Clearly you’ve never met a helicopter parent.
1761,I’ve seen parents tell their children to lie about symptoms to get anti-biotics because they think they “need” them even though they likely have a virus -it’s a common problem that adds to the anti-biotic resistance crisis.
1762,"Same thing here, a child can be told to tell a doctor “I feel like I can’t breathe”.... guess what, doctor isn’t gonna risk it they’re going to admit them and check it out."

1771,Yeah I believe the 1:2-1:4 ratio is correct TODAY.
1772,And that fraction has come down considerably.
1773,Like come on a little common sense here.
1774,In March/April we didn’t even agree wearing masks was helpful - how the hell were we accurately measuring the outbreaks in NYC/New Orleans/Connecticut etc.
1775,?
1776,We weren’t.
1777,Then over the summer we were under estimating because Texas/the south didn’t test nearly enough to accurately reflect all the cases they were seeing.
1778,Now that fraction has come down some.
1779,We can’t go back in time but if we continue to catch more infections that fraction comes down.
1780,From 1/10 back in the day to maybe 1/2-1/4 now.
1781,Our under capacity of testing still exists.
1782,But was much lower back in the day.
1783,I will be wearing a mask traveling or in medical facilities pretty much from now on (2020 first year I never got strep throat so happy to continue it) so vaccine won’t effect that behavior.
1784,Once my wife and I are vaccinated we will have a larger bubble (go from current 8 to more like 20) and once the whole bubble is vaccinated we are going on holiday (July ish).

1793,"Here’s my take on the potential for vaccine escaping COVID mutations-

The Moderna vaccine in particular is really, really good."
1794,Supposedly they could adapt it fairly easily to a new strain and get doses out relatively quickly.
1795,"It seems that the real challenge isn’t getting a new version of the vaccine that is effective against these variants, it’s being able to actually distribute it."
1796,"That’s where the delay would be, and the current rate of vaccination is not good enough to avoid a scenario where it takes us over half a year to catch up with these variants, if they do actually evade the vaccine at all."
1797,I hope this is the case.
1798,"It’s not how I’ve been interpreting these headlines, however."
1799,A lot of officials seem to think that masking and some level of distancing will be the norm throughout 2021 and even beyond.

1806,1.
1807,There’s still a risk to you.
1808,Young people are dying too and ending up with long-term health issues.
1809,With the vaccine that risk will probably drop to basically zero.
1810,2.
1811,We don’t know for sure if vaccines will also cut down transmission but the experts are saying it’s likely.
1812,It’s just that they’re scientists and don’t feel right being too confident in anything without data.

1817,"Trump's nomination in 2018 sat for so long the White House had to renominate him twice – once at the beginning of 2019 and again in March 2020 – as the administration, Mitch McConnell and the rest of the Senate Republican leadership showed no urgency in filling the appointment."

1843,It only says 40% experienced “reduced antibody response.” Which doesn’t mean much.

1854,"Yeah, I get being cautious without official data, but the messaging seems to suggest it's 50/50 that these vaccines will be nearly unique in the history of vaccines in not affecting transmission."

1877,Sure there are young presumably healthy people that have died but they are not the norm.
1878,Saying you know an active elderly person who didn’t contract it is just as anecdotal as saying you know an active 25 year old who died from it.
1879,"Its widely available knowledge that factors like vitamin D etc are playing a big role, I know you aren’t trying to deny that."

Front line workers ( healthcare and groceries/infrastructure), multi-person care facilities and prisons."
1888,Next should be ages 20-40 years old as this group are the ones who are needing to work/ be in larger groups etc.
1889,Retired individuals do have an opportunity to  self-quarantine which this younger age group would not be able to do.
1890,Once the spread is more under control the next stage would be to vaccinate the people at highest risk of death or severe COVID symptoms.
1891,"I know this isn’t the popular opinion, in a space of having limited vaccines, I believe the priority is stopping the spread and not necessarily vaccinating the most vulnerable."
1892,As someone who is familiar with CDPH...I am not shocked at all
1893,Doesn’t this just completely discredit their claim about the efficacy of the first vaccine?
1894,Really?
1895,"Well damn my Mom and I were going to go out and eat 14 days after our second dose, oh well guess we’ll eat at home."
1896,"This is about Wake county in North Carolina, not the Bay Area."
1897,Did you seriously think they meant that would end the pandemic?
1898,It was never meant to do that and if you somehow think it was you should be embarrassed.
1899,That's  incredibly good news!
1900,I teach in the Midwest.
1901,We’ve been in person since August.
1902,"My school has a hybrid schedule, but there’s still over 2,000 kids at school."
1903,"We’ve been in the red zone, officially, since December."
1904,It’s insanity.
1905,I wonder what Cuomo is gonna do when Trump is out of office and he actually has to start accept responsibility for his mistakes.
1906,Must be hard.
1907,[deleted]
1908,It’s my understanding that the antibodies will wear off faster than the virus will mutate.
1909,"So if you were vaccinated and the virus mutates, you theoretically should still be mostly covered against that new mutation."
1910,If it takes 2 years for it to mutate radically (which is a figure I read from one doctor) your antibodies will have probably already waned by then so yeah you’d probably need to get an updated vaccine.
1911,But a few articles I read (talking about the S.A. Mutation) said the virus is not going to pop out one day and be 0% effective against the current vaccine.
1912,"As with my previous comments, I’ll try to find some sources where they were talking about this."
1913,[deleted]
1914,"Goes all the way back to the parents, I’m sure."
1915,"Until issues of mental health, substance abuse, and general shitty parenting are addressed at a world-wide scale there will be problems like this."
1916,What makes you think politicians are eager to continue lockdowns indefinitely?
1917,"Tax revenue is disappearing, along with businesses and jobs, and people are angry."
1918,Why would they want to do that for 3 years?
1919,How would they ever hope to have a political future?
1920,What constituency is there for that?
1921,"Maybe, just maybe, it's because 400,000 people are dead and the virus is rampant."
1922,"When it's not rampant, these restrictions will go away."
1923,This is misinformation.
1924,There is nothing in the Phase 3 data suggesting what you say.
1925,[deleted]
1926,Wearing a mask in a store is not excessive.
1927,"From that link:

&gt;If there is an example of a vaccine in widespread clinical use that has this selective effect — prevents disease but not infection — I can’t think of one!"
1928,What about the flu?
1929,"Doesn't that not necessarily prevent infection, just make symptoms not as bad (like I've heard them say about the covid vaccines 1000 times)?"
1930,Yes if they're not sneezing and coughing then they're spreading less flu.
1931,Then he says that most covid spread is not from asymptomatic - I hadn't heard that before.
1932,I thought asymptomatic spread was its superpower that made it the nightmare that it is.
1933,So why can't we control it just by taking temperatures at checkpoints?
1934,"The numbers he gives about Moderna - 39 placebo were asymptomatic and spreading, but only 15 vaccinated were."
1935,That's good news.
1936,Vaccinated people are 60% less likely to spread it aysmpomatically.
1937,"Is a 40% chance ""very unlikely""?"
1938,"When you say people are insisting this vaccine is vastly different than any other, you must be referring to vaccines like mumps, polio etc., a ""one and done"" pass/fail type vaccine."
1939,This one literally is different from that.
1940,See e.g.
1941,"the link you posted, the 15 people in the Moderna study who were asympomatic infected."
1942,10 days followed by a negative test meets the current CDC standards for quarantine.
1943,He's probably good to go.
1944,Did you read anything I even wrote?
1945,What difference would it make?
1946,"This entire thread is about how you can *still* transmit the virus to that immunocompromised person, regardless of if you’ve been vaccinated yourself."
1947,"These people either have never had the flu, or think their yearly cold is the flu."
1948,[deleted]
1949,Exactly.
1950,"On our school district parent page, there has been a lot of “send the kinds back, they need normalcy” and such."
1951,Then they throw a fit when kids are sent home due to contact tracing or lack of staff.
1952,"It’s like if they stomp their feet harder, they’ll get what they want."
1953,Some people do not have the ability to realize this is a real thing we are dealing with.
1954,"It sucks, but it is global."
1955,You can’t talk to the manager of covid.
1956,I assume it’s because it is the first “big thing” that has affected most of us.
1957,"We have not lived through such a life changing event before, therefore some seriously cannot grasp the severity of it."
1958,I feel like this might be one of the most explained concepts on reddit.
1959,Like I am always seeing this explanation and it still amazes me a bit that there are new people finding out here on reddit.
1960,But... [relevant xkcd comic](https://xkcd.com/1053/)
1961,"""I don't have any friends here, I'm not part of a group!"""
1962,"""ALRIGHT WE NEED PEOPLE TO GO TO THE BACK OF THE STORE TO STOP PEOPLE GOING IN."""
1963,More lies and lies and lies...
1964,&gt;when phagocytic cells present the spike protein it creates a scenario where an autoimmune disease could develop and this could not be known or present for many years.
1965,This is not unique to mRNA vaccines.
1966,"In fact, what happens when a virus, any virus, infects a cell in a human?"
1967,How are mRNA vaccines different?
1968,They're not.
1969,You're making a huge leap right after you touched the finish line.
1970,The cells that take in the mRNA vaccine present basically identically to infected cells.
1971,There is no more potential for autoimmune disease from the mRNA vaccines than walking down the street.
1972,All of that knowledge in one easy to swallow tablet?
1973,They have been constantly lying from day one of this pandemic (mask don't help/we need to reserve masks).
1974,Only a dumb person would wonder why people question their advice.
1975,This media fear mongering is deeply unethical.
1976,The vaccines are still effective against these strains.
1977,Sick of this doom clickbait crap.
1978,"To be honest though, NY and NJ were hit hard very early on."
1979,There was very little knowledge on how to treat patients and no known helpful medications.
1980,What's happening in the rest of the country now is like the steamroller scene from Austin Powers.
1981,TLDR they work.
1982,I'm getting $90.00 a visit and then $27.00 a safely call.
1983,Visits are every 4 months calls are every 4 weeks should last 2 years.
1984,"I had an unscheduled visit to offer me ""unblinding"" about two weeks ago."
1985,Fortunately both my wife and I were vaccinated.
1986,"No you are offered it and under no obligation to take it

Source: I live in the UK"
1987,Just swish some bleach around your mouth afterwards.
1988,"It'll destroy the virus, destroy the autism chemicals in the vaccine, and kill any COVID-19 in your body to boot."
1989,Note: do not do this.
1990,"Thing is though the South Korean population is incredibly densely populated around Seoul, Gyeonggi-do and Incheon."
1991,Around half the country live in these well connected and highly urbanised areas.
1992,"The logistical challenge is huge, but I wouldn’t put it past the government to be able to reach the 400K target."
1993,Especially when they can at any time call on nearly half a million troops to lend a hand to the logistical effort.
1994,Except the consequences for those administering the vaccine are obscenely imbalanced on a personal level: fewer (other) people vaccinated vs losing your licence and career
1995,"Everyone is looking for these target dates, but were gonna know pretty clearly from data how well things are working."
1996,"4000 Americans are dying everyday under current mask-wearing conditions, albeit with significant non-compliance."
1997,"If that drops by 90%, we'll see precautions easing."
1998,"If for whatever reason 1000 Americans are still dying everyday, we won't."
1999,I got called by one of the study nurses who told me she could not unblind me.
2000,I told her I was phase 1a and she didn't believe me.
2001,Her supervisor had to get involved and call me back an hour later.
2002,"You are entitled to your opinion, but the data exists, peer reviewed or not."
2003,You are welcome to check out the original paper that dr Feigl qoutes.
2004,In option 1 how is herd immunity going to work if the virus can keep spreading to people who were vaccinated or previously infected?
2005,Seems like it would never stop spreading
2006,Because you don't want to kill someone who is immunocompromised?
2007,Cuomo is not the only one who did that...
2008,"Her salary is  $174,000 per year and she gets tons of benefits."
2009,"Yes, she is rich."
2010,But that's not a reason to dislike her.
2011,"[Allegedly](https://www.retaildetail.eu/en/news/food/aldi-nord-and-aldi-s%C3%BCd-about-merge)

But there isn't too much news about it."
2012,That article is from February and everything more recent just seems to be repeating what was already said.
2013,"Instead of automatically thinking how bad people could take advantage of something in theory, try thinking about the good people it will benefit."
2014,As long as everyone gets it asap thats all I care about.
2015,"My brother got a molecular test after 10 days of being possibly infected, and today just got a negative result."
2016,Can he just walk normally around the house or does he need to wait more?
2017,"First of all, don’t say this shit as an absolute fact when there hasn’t been any scientific study."
2018,Second no vaccine ever created hasn’t at least reduced spread.
2019,Third the initial data coming out of Israel disagrees with you
2020,"No, they manyfacture the polyethelene glycol to suspend the vaccine in because it mixes well and the vaccine won't separate snd sink or stick to the sides of the vials containing the vaccine."
2021,And it is localized to one clinic.
2022,We have dispensed thousands from this lot in the Bay Area without negative reactions.
2023,Employers in the states have a myriad of different time off systems.
2024,"If you're an exempt employee (AKA salaried), then it's likely that you can take off doctor's appointments and the like at your convenience and as long as it doesn't get excessive no one will say anything."
2025,"If you're an hourly white collar worker (maybe a bank teller or a low level clerk somewhere), you probably get 16 or 20 hours of ""personal time."""
2026,That's used for doctor's appointments and other such things that don't usually take a whole day.
2027,You still have traditional sick days and vacation days on top of that.
2028,"If you're a blue collar worker like a grocery worker, you likely only have traditional vacation time."
2029,You also likely need some time with the employer to get it.
2030,"After your 1st year, you get one week."
2031,"Then after 5 years, you get 2 weeks, and after 10 years, 3 weeks, and 20 years 4 weeks or something like that."
2032,It also isn't uncommon for you to have to take vacation as a block week.
2033,And these breakdowns aren't super perfect.
2034,A blue collar employee might have a boss that's legit and knows that other folks can cover it and so doesn't worry about doctor's appointments and the like.
2035,Or you could be a salaried worker with a terrible employer and you have to use vacation days for doctor's appointments.
2036,Sorry for not having sources but what I’ve read they said that the changes will be slower than that.
2037,One mutation may only be 70% effective and in a month a new mutation is 58% effective.
2038,"I assume at some point they tweak that vaccine to get back up as close to 100% as possible with the most dominant strain, similar to how they do the flu every year."
2039,I haven’t heard anything about a coronavirus mutating so fast that vaccine efficacy goes from 80% to 20% instantly.
2040,"Again, sorry for no sources."
2041,I’ll try to find some statements I read backing that up.
2042,Make sure you have working smoke detectors everywhere.
2043,The secret ingredient is Putin’s saliva.
2044,I'm not 100% sure
2045,Dude... no one wants to come here.
2046,&gt;...don’t have the emotional intelligence to recognize why they are upset and deal with it as an adult instead of at the level of a toddler.
2047,Could have something to do with what their leaders have been teaching them for years.
2048,But aren't they in discussions to merge again?
2049,"“Two weeks to slow the spread” only lasted maybe one weekend, then they moved the goalpost to 18 months, then after the incumbent president tried to use the vaccine for his re-election they switched to a few years."
2050,"Then after the election ended, they moved the goalpost  back to sometime in 2021."
2051,Smoke some lettuce!
2052,!
2053,[removed]
2054,&gt;	People that are vaccinated still contract covid19 and you can still give it to other people.
2055,"Real question then: for the younger, low risk population, *why the fuck* should they care about getting vaccinated then?"
2056,"We’ve been told “oh herd immunity oh transmission” for fucking forever, and now the vaccine is out and it’s like lul jk everyone’s just asymptomatic now."
2057,"I mean seriously, what’s the whole fucking point if vaccinated people can still spread the virus."
2058,"What’s my motivation to get vaccinated if I still have to mask and distance, knowing that my chance of getting covid is low and the chance of dying is like nil"
2059,[removed]
2060,"Can confirm, Burleson has the only one."
2061,Same issue here with family.
2062,It's the worst.

2068,Probably because we can't trace to the exact place someone got infected.
2069,Any number of the other 22 students and 5 staff could have gotten at it whatever thanksgiving gathering they attended--not at school.
2070,Well heck yes Michigan should be vaccinating them.
2071,They’d be shooting themselves in the foot else.
2072,"Wear a mask, wash hands and social distance when possible but otherwise you should be good."
2073,There’s also a good chance your eye doctor has also already gotten vaccinated as well.
2074,I guess.
2075,I've never really had the amazing quality experience that everyone is talking about.
2076,"Their ranch dressing is terrible, for example."
2077,[removed]
2078,Probably not.
2079,Umm that's not entirely true.
2080,"People who make a salary are entitled to overtime if they work more than 40 hours per week, unless they are management or supervisors."
2081,Management does not have to be paid overtime.
2082,There are also some very specific jobs that the department of labor lists as not being eligible for overtime as well.
2083,"That is a completely valid argument, but a weak one in my opinion."
2084,"There are reasons that everybody has about why they should get a vaccine first or how it would benefit them, or why a family member, friend, public figure, celebrity should get it first because they are a lifeline."
2085,"Richer countries don't help other countries, the only countries that help other countries are the ones just below the world powers"
2086,It's the exact same algorithm as any other sub.
2087,This sub might just seem skewed when you view hot or best because comments are pretty polarizing.
2088,"Just scroll through new and you can see that every single ""sky is falling"" comment is appropriately downvoted right away."
2089,I don't care that people won't get the vaccine at the same time.
2090,I don't care that other people will take advantage of me being vaccinated and not wearing a mask.
2091,I'm not responsible for idiots.
2092,I'm not going to virtue signal a mask for no reason.
2093,Sorry.
2094,"If a mask is deemed to be a necessity for some odd unexpected reason, I'll continue wearing one when vaccinated but that's not going to happen."
2095,Flu outbreaks havent threatened hospitals with having to turn people away and running out of oxygen?
2096,"They also havent meant health care workers in large numbers, have caught such a bad dose of flu that they cannot themselves work."
2097,Just a thought?
2098,No doctor and no nurse next time you want urgent treatment for appendicitis or something?
2099,Doesnt happen with the flu...
2100,"Ok, so take 2 doses."
2101,"You know, like the people who made the thing recommended"
2102,"Holy shit, that really sucks."
2103,"That said,it looks like it's been handled
  
&gt; The majority of the 21 shipments were resent on Monday night with the rest being sent Tuesday."
2104,One time pay for a potential life long health effect.
2105,Sure let’s do it
2106,I know a girl who is a serious anti-masker.
2107,Just because she is attractive people keep calling her a hero and she started her own protest group and she 100% believes that she is a hero.
2108,"You know, I don't care."
2109,I don't want my kids getting an so far understudied disease that may or may not damage their health for decades or life long.
2110,Do you have kids?
2111,I guess not.
2112,More and more there is evidence that COVID damages lunges and the cardiovascular system even in person who do not exhibit symptoms or light symptoms.
2113,It is not only about the death statistics.
2114,It is about impacted health that can cost the people their life quality and millions in dollars for the rest of the society.
2115,The variants emerging now have nothing to do with evading vaccines.
2116,I'm pretty confident that most of the vaccines will be pretty resistant to viral evolution.
2117,"They may decrease in effectiveness as we go, but future versions (boosters) will take care of that."
2118,And they have a lot of room to decline before they're not worth using.
2119,I also feel the need to repeat that mutations are random and variants take over from the previous version only if they are more effective transmitters.
2120,"Whether they cause the same disease, less disease, or more, is completely random."
2121,"It's not a ""mutation = bad"" equation."
2122,[deleted]
2123,So we're supposed to base the effect on schools on which articles are being written and submitted here?
2124,I know several teachers in schools around me and they're threatened with FERPA violations if they attempt to publicly discuss how many students are out at school.
2125,Students and parents are also recommended to not have the student tested and for just parents to get tested.
2126,This isn't even unique to the area around me.
2127,Yes.
2128,All the experts were saying this would be like 1~2 years.
2129,Even saying that it might be 1 year or more to even get a vaccine.
2130,Getting vaccinations out in December is actually really good
2131,"On every post I see about Aldi, I will always say that I miss Aldi."
2132,They cannot be found where I live but they hold a special place in my thrifty heart.
2133,Guarantee you J&amp;J won’t claim 100% when they apply for EUA
2134,I guess I can agree to disagree.
2135,If you interpolate between over the 6 day drop you can still trend see the trend.
2136,It’s definitely not increasing at the same rate it was 2-3 weeks ago and appears to has leveled off.
2137,We probably have a million that will not be distributed and put in arms during the time Canada isnt getting shipments and then we will also be getting more shipments.
2138,Shouldnt be a big issue
2139,All you do is post about Covid.
2140,I'm now beginning to think this is a fake account.

2147,Am I going o suffer from some immune disease in the future.

2185,"There is no human to human spread of tetanus afaik, maybe a really specific cases could occur, but you can't ""sneeze tetanus"", the bacteria lives in anaerobic environments."
2186,"The vaccine doesn't even help you kill it, it immunizes you against the toxin it produces, which otherwise kills you quite efficiently - so the antibodies created by the vaccine attack this toxin, not the bacterium itself."
2187,Yes this!
2188,Do we know where J&amp;J is at?
2189,I just applied today to be in the Medicago Phase III trial because I just want to help get things moved along.

2207,It doesn’t say
2208,"They’re not “going” anywhere, they just won’t exist."
2209,They’re revamping their European manufacturing facility (which Canada gets shipments from) for higher output.
2210,Xenophobic?
2211,Not really.
2212,Aldi Nord doesnt own Traders Joe's.
2213,"They are both owned by the Markus Foundation, which is owned by the son and the widow of the other son of the original Aldi North founder."
2214,Pretty close though
2215,"Ok, get sick then"
2216,any reason why Health Canada isn't?
2217,they need to get on with it!
2218,!
2219,This is my biggest issue with going with as many jabs as possible instead of making sure people can get second doses.
2220,Even though mutations occur less frequently in viruses the number of infections is so high it almost doesn’t matter.
2221,All of the variants being discovered/emerging just prove that point.
2222,I'm invested in news that alters what we as a world population are following.
2223,If France is saying masks aren't very useful.
2224,Other nations should be taking note.
2225,"This represents about 12,000 doses."
2226,"Unfortunate, though we knew there would be distribution hiccups to iron out."
2227,"Somewhat of a silver lining, per MI Gov:

&gt; Although it is unfortunate that this vaccine will not be able to be used, we are pleased that the safeguards put into place to ensure the integrity of the vaccine worked."
2228,This is the first report of vaccine potentially being compromised during shipment in Michigan and we are working quickly with the distributor to have replacement vaccine shipped out
2229,It was part of the deal with Pfizer.
2230,"Remember, deaths and hospitalizations are lagging indicators."
2231,The fact that their curve has not bent is not concerning.
2232,"However, if it is still like this in a month, I would be concerned."
2233,Agree that the curve should start turning any day.
2234,Smaller infectious dose due to higher efficiency at invading cells.
2235,"That is actually normal in Europe, it reduces waste."
2236,"&gt;knowing that a few kids are going to die as a result isn’t ignorant

Suggesting the only harm that can happen is death is pretty ignorant."
2237,"There has been plenty of discussion just the past few days, not to mention the past several months, regarding the long term effects this can have on people."
2238,"If you want to choose to ignore that, don't be surprised if people call you out for ignoring such issues with your arguments here."
2239,Same thing with Lidl in Finland.
2240,That is the UK not the USA?
2241,You are not really taking into account the fact that in most countries we have had lockdowns - if we had not had lockdowns the average age might be a lot younger.
2242,The average age of death is also skewed by outbreaks in elderly homes.
2243,Do you see the consequences of hospital workers and nurses being off sick?
2244,The whole point of lockdowns is to prevent pressure on hospitals.
2245,"Remember if this thing was allowed to spread even more rampantly , that if you or someone else say in their 30s 40s needed a heart operation you might not be able to have it because of lack of health care staff or you might catch covid yourself while in the hospital."
2246,So it could affect you.
2247,"The whole ""average age of death is 80"" is just another way of saying "" it doesnt affect me so fuck everyone else."""
2248,Come on snake eyes
2249,may I inquire as to what country your in?
2250,An entirely susceptible population + the more transmissible variant is a ticking bomb.
2251,"Maybe, but I’m trying to remain optimistic!"
2252,"But yes, way to many selfish people out there."

2254,"EXTREMELY well articulated, thank you for that!"

2257,This.
2258,My entire household of 5 wants the vaccine.
2259,"We want to go back to going out, having fun."
2260,"We wear masks everywhere, have been on remote work and school since the start."
2261,"If other idiots are refusing, make room for us!"
2262,Meanwhile schools: OPEN ER UP
2263,I emailed my workplace about whether or not they would pay us to get the vaccine and nope.
2264,The company y couldn't force people to take it and that it would have to be our own responsibility.
2265,"Bullshit, it mostly comes down to greed, can't even do a lil stipend of 20$ smh"
2266,Yup.
2267,"The commenter above, however, did not."
2268,"Good, because I want things to go back to  normal!"
2269,"Yes, jump to the hyperbolic scenario that was never presented in opposition to strawman them into a corner."
2270,Glorious argument.
2271,"No, the argument was that we simply don't know the ultimate outcome for children getting this."
2272,"You seem to like to suggest that you do know, even though you do not."
2273,"The first time I had the *flu* flu, I remember it hit in a matter of minutes: I got up to walk from my couch to my kitchen and I was caught by a sudden sense of cold, my forehead got clammy, and I started shivering uncontrollably (I later learned these were called 'rigors', also a COVID symptom)."
2274,I wrapped myself in a blanket and took my temperature that spiked to 103.
2275,"I slept it off over the course of 2 days, but I still felt like shit for the next week straight at least."

2280,The guy didn't have his crystal ball handy I guess.
2281,But that's not relevant to what I just said.
2282,No expert was saying this would be over by summer 2020.
2283,"That there would be a death count of 60k rather than 100k or 1m, that doesnt mean it would be over by summer, that just means it would have a lower death count."

2291,It's just too early to tell.

It's actually super rare to be reinfected, with some estimates that you can be protected for over a year after contracting Covid."

2302,which is infuriating coming from a place that had an HEB to Dallas.
2303,The grocery stores here suck.
2304,They just outright suck.
2305,I have to go to four different places to get the same selection I had at 1 HEB.
2306,I think we approached this from two different perspectives.
2307,"To me, ""flatten the curve"" was to buy time for hospitals to prepare for a big wave of patients and then we as a society figure out how to live with it."
2308,"In other words, reasonable precautions that don't destroy society and create frankly worse problems."
2309,"You seem to think OF COURSE our lives must now revolve around avoiding COVID at all costs and that no one should even think of resuming normalcy until there are perfect widespread vaccines and basically no risk, no matter how long it takes."
2310,That's not realistic.
2311,That's a dystopian nightmare.
2312,Switzerland is in a almost lockdown until 1st of March although our cases are dropping rapidly (2200 today).
2313,We hope by keeping the restrictions + vaccines we might be below the 1k5 cases per day.
2314,I think the CDC forgot lmao
2315,Because you'd rather not get COVID at all.
2316,Your body might NOT be able to fight it without serious illness or long term complications
2317,"&gt;Separate figures from the Office for National Statistics for the week to 8 January showed that more than 25,000 people have died from Covid in care homes across the UK since the start of the pandemic."
2318,"“The guidelines were followed to the letter, PPE, restrictions on visiting and we were testing vigorously, taking temperatures and before I knew it the whole house had it,” said Kat Cotton, the manager who has been working 18-hour days."
2319,"Meanwhile, the government has acted to help care homes accept Covid-positive patients from crowded hospitals by underwriting the risk posed by them spreading the virus."
2320,Funny you said this and now 1 in 3 in la are infected
2321,Yep all of the articles are about how the rollout has been such a failure and a disappointment but the US is among the best in the world so far.
2322,Thank you so much!
2323,That shows how much more aggravating it must have been than the brief descriptions that were provided before.
2324,It wouldn't surprise me if poorer countries are better off with Europe and the US vaccinating the economically active part of their population with the increase in economic activity and tourism that follows.
2325,These people also tend to travel the most.
2326,"African countries haven't been hit particularly hard, South Africa being the exception, and they typically have young populations, so I honestly think it's arguable they need the vaccine less."
2327,Why don't you google yourself if you are so interested.
2328,You'll find she's convicted of destroying checkpoints and disobeying lock down orders.
2329,The vaccine itself only lasts a few days in your body.
2330,"The antibodies your body makes can last many months, and other changes in your immune system can last years or decades."
2331,At this point there just has not been enough time to be sure how long immunity lasts.
2332,If immunity lasts 10 years you need to wait 10 years to confirm that.
2333,So far every indication is that some level of immunity lasts several months at least and it's still very possible it lasts a few years.
2334,"In the event that immunity does fade, we can give people booster shots."
2335,I will also say that the nice thing about of having 10+ vaccines in late stage development plus another 100 in an earlier stage is that even if the first few only generate 8-12 months of immunity we have many more chances to get a much longer lasting one.
2336,lol
2337,"Sorry man, your parents are giving you bad advice."
2338,Contact the testing admin again to see if they can make accommodations for you.
2339,"If not, just wait for the next test"
2340,I also wonder how they determine the allocations.
2341,It was supposed to be roughly by population size but there is a lot of variance.
2342,Also the states vary a lot like California has 7x the population of Indiana and some states have a centralized health care system making for easier distribution and others don't.
2343,Now they seem to be shifting to a model where they send more vaccine to places that are better at distributing it.
2344,This can also make sense but can also exacerbate problems in states that don't have it together.
2345,But the key question that nobody seems to be able to answer is what is happening to these doses that aren't being given.
2346,I get that there can be logistical problems.
2347,If you are a state and you send your batch of vaccine to 1000's of places for distribution I am sure it is all too easy to send too many to one place and not enough to another.
2348,I have read that every vial has a tracking chip with a unique number to make sure it is not counterfeit and to enable tracking.
2349,So it seems like they should be able to know where every vial is assuming it has been scanned or whatever.
2350,Maybe they aren't even doing that.
2351,No the new York numbers show that more people are following social distance and mask guidines

2357,"With the U.K. variant and the 'escape mutant' strain from South Africa, I'm concerned with what'll happen if I get Moderna's vaccine (they say it'll be good for one year)."
2358,"If I get sick, will I develop active antibodies that linger even after the initial Moderna vaccine wears off?"
2359,Is this how it works?
2360,Do I have it right?
2361,"We have had over 4,000 variants recorded to date, only one had an impact on antibody effectiveness, and a minor one at that (that variant is also most likely extinct) so empirically speaking the odds that any given variant have an impact on efficacy is 1 out of 4,000."
2362,Any impact will likely be minor.
2363,"Remember, the spike is the key the virus use to unlock our cells, if they changed to the point where antibodies don't work well anymore, they would also lose ability to infect our cells."
2364,Why do i wear seat belts if the windshield absorbs the impact
2365,"Thank you for saying this, the headline (and the article) are flat out misinformation."

\- Vaccination against COVID-19 with a preparation from Pfizer / BioNTech causes the production of more antibodies than coronavirus infection and recovery - said the representative of the Israeli Ministry of Health during the Knesset committee meeting."
2914,"📷Israel has started to vaccinate people over the age of 45 / AHMAD GHARABLI / AFP

""This is surprising, I do not know if there is any other disease in which the vaccine will protect better than the disease itself,"" said Dr. Roi Singer, deputy director of the department of epidemiology at the ministry, quoted in the Maariw daily."
2915,Similar data was published by the Sheba Hospital in Tel Hashomer near Tel Aviv after a serological test on vaccinated workers.
2916,"The results show that around a week after the second dose of the vaccine, 100 of the 102 subjects showed a six- to 20-fold increase in the number of antibodies, and the amount is even higher than that produced by patients who became seriously ill with COVID-19."
2917,"The results also show that only two workers developed low levels of antibodies, however, as noted, their immune systems are weakened."
2918,"Prof. Gili Regew-Johaj, director of the hospital's infection prevention unit, said the study ""was in line with Pfizer's, and even better than expected."""
2919,"- We certainly have reason to be optimistic - she added, quoted by the TV Reszet 13."
2920,"Israel is a world leader in the vaccination campaign: as of December 20, more than 2.1 million people out of 9.3 million have already received the vaccine."

2923,It's possible to win this game of biotag.
2924,Maybe swap your cloth mask for one of the kn95 available on Amazon and get your vaccine as soon as you can.

2942,It took hours and my child was basically unresponsive and I ended up flipping out and taking him to a different ER where they immediately treated him.
2943,"I have PTSD from the experience, and cannot IMAGINE what parents go through with long-term sicker children than I had."
2944,I have no desire to find out.
2945,And I don’t know for sure that my kids don’t have “pre-existing” conditions.
2946,Some things/diseases go undiagnosed until all of a sudden symptoms appear...it is not worth the gamble.

2954,Anecdotal but I had a friend that had it that hooked up with a guy the day before she showed symptoms and tested positive and the guy never got it.
2955,You never know.
2956,Where are the people saying children won't be affected badly by this virus?
2957,"Yes, but this is far far higher than the &lt;10 cases we had for about a week straight."
2958,"We're also 2 weeks after the most celebrated holiday time in Japan where everyone goes home (and this is where Japanese people generally won't have listened to the government's 'requests' to stay home, requests which up till a couple of months ago was somewhat being adhered to."
2959,Government can't and aren't doing anything apart from saying please.
2960,"There's also almost no testing, and no proper planned vaccination rollout for anyone but the front line workers, most likely because Japan is one of (if not the most) anti-vac countries in the world."
2961,None?
2962,What about Taiwan?
2963,South Korea did a really good job too.
2964,Basically all of East Asia did (probably helped by climate).

3015,GISAID is tracking vairants.
3016,"it started to track influenza strains

https://www.gisaid.org

Vaccines are being tested against vaccines as they become known but it takes weeks."
3017,From my reading most vaccine makers test themselves and some countries report doing their own testing.
3018,I recall reading the UK was testing the strain they found.
3019,Just a reminder the same things that reduce spread with 'regular' covid19 still reduces spread with the more infectious strains.

3021,Remember aerosols linger in the air for hours so don't take off your mask in the break room at work or the bathroom like i've read some have.
3022,Some scientists suggest if you must share a vehicle with someone not of our household set as far apart as possible and open the windows away from you both 3 inches so the air circulates **away** from you instead of sucking any possible virues right past your face on the way out if you open the one next to you.

3029,Indonesia in the house here.
3030,Will report.
3031,This is interesting depending on the family dynamic.
3032,If that one person is the one in the family that has taken the recommendations seriously and even within the household if they live together stayed in separate living quarters it is not impressive in terms of vaccine effect.
3033,"If this was just a typical family where 1 random person got vaccinated and was otherwise semi-compliant with masks and social distancing like a good percentage of people are and avoided getting COVID when everyone else in their family did, it is interesting."
3034,"I got my second dose yesterday morning, and I think I must be a lucky one because I haven’t felt bad."
3035,"I even scheduled myself off work today expecting to feel crappy... at most I had a few moments where I thought “is this a chill?” “Am I more tired than normal?”

I took ibuprofen and Tylenol every six hours or so after my shot which possibly helped keep side effects at bay"

3083,It doesn’t worry me.
3084,What worries me is the affect this will have on ppl getting vaccinated because they think it isn’t safe.
3085,"I've read the info and believe in science, and I believed these vaccines were safe and effective basically for a while now."
3086,"But this news... As someone who's parents are very high risk, it really confirms it for me."
3087,It gives me so much hope that they'll be safe once they receive their two doses.
3088,I feel more relief now than I did when I received my own doses.
3089,Viruses are not sentient.
3090,It does not increase the likelihood that it will become vaccine resistant if we use a less effective vaccine.

3246,"Only 1,113 ICU beds available?!?"

3271,"For an ambitious career politician, that choice is a no-brainer."
3272,Is this news?
3273,I disagree.
3274,Spreading it to every state at the same time based on population size and having the states use those critical first batches of vaccine on high risk people makes the most sense.

3276,It's a false dichotomy.
3277,"If you look at countries that locked down hard and suppressed the virus vs ones that didn't and let covid run free, stronger lockdowns are strongly correlated with better economic outcomes."
3278,I would argue that being immune would in fact prevent that
3279,I’m in Iowa too.
3280,Back home at my parents cause #unemployed.
3281,It got really bad.
3282,Reynolds finally mandated masks and closed some things.
3283,And now ppl are right back to not wearing masks in public.
3284,Our testing is absolutely piss poor.
3285,30 to 40% positive everyday.
3286,We have no real idea of where the virus is and no tracing to let ppl know they were exposed.
3287,"Until cases are down down and we have a decent low positivity rate, I think it’s just a matter of time before it gets bad again."
3288,But the associated risk is that people don't get their second dose due to delays in supply.
3289,That was the reason behind allocating two doses per person.
3290,I'm just saying the benefits to doing it this way far outweigh the risks of people not getting their second dose (especially since a lot of people aren't even coming back for dose 2)

3320,The mRNA vaccines it’s fundamentally impossible because none of the ‘virusy’ part of the virus is in the vaccine at all.
3321,"Only the spike protein part, which is the very small ‘key’ that allows a virus to enter a cell of your body."

3415,"LOS ANGELES (AP) — California's state epidemiologist is urging a halt to more than 300,000 coronavirus vaccinations using a Moderna vaccine version because some people received medical treatment for possible severe allergic reactions."
3416,"Dr. Erica S. Pan on Sunday recommended providers stop using lot 41L20A of the Moderna vaccine pending completion of an investigation by state officials, Moderna, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and the federal Food and Drug Administration."
3417,"""Out of an extreme abundance of caution and also recognizing the extremely limited supply of vaccine, we are recommending that providers use other available vaccine inventory,"" Pan said in a statement."
3418,"She said more than 330,000 doses from the lot arrived in California between Jan. 5 and Jan. 12 and were distributed to 287 providers."
3419,"Fewer than 10 people, who all received the vaccine at the same community site, needed medical attention over a 24-hour period, Pan said."
3420,No other similar clusters were found.
3421,Pan did not specify the number of cases involved or where they occurred.
3422,"However, six San Diego health care workers had allergic reactions to vaccines they received at a mass vaccination center on Jan. 14."
3423,"The site was temporarily closed and is now using other vaccines, KTGV-TV reported."
3424,"The CDC has said the vaccine can cause side effects for a few days that include fever, chills, headache, swelling or tiredness, ""which are normal signs that your body is building protection."""
3425,"However, severe reactions are extremely rare."
3426,"Pan said in a vaccine similar to Moderna, the rate of anaphylaxis — in which an immune system reaction can block breathing and cause blood pressure to drop — was about 1 in 100,000."
3427,"The announcement came as California counties continue to plead for more COVID-19 vaccine as the state tries to reduce its rate of infection, which has led to record numbers of hospitalizations and deaths."
3428,"California, with a population of 40 million, has received about 3.5 million vaccine doses and has only administered about a third of them, according to the CDC."
3429,"So far the state has vaccinated just 2,468 people per 100,000 residents, a rate that falls well below the national average, according to the federal data."
3430,Although Gov.
3431,"Gavin Newsom announced last week said anyone age 65 and older would be eligible to start receiving the vaccine, Los Angeles County and some others have said they do not have enough doses to vaccinate so many people and are concentrating on inoculating health care workers and the most vulnerable elderly living in care homes first."
3432,"On Monday, the superintendent of the Los Angeles Unified School District sent a letter to state and county public health officials asking for authorization to provide COVID-19 vaccinations at schools for staff, local community members and for students once a vaccine for children has been approved."
3433,"""Doing so will help reopen schools as soon as possible, and in the safest way possible,"" Superintendent Austin Beutner wrote."
3434,"California is nearing 3 million coronavirus cases and more than 33,600 people have died since the start of the pandemic last year, according to figures from Johns Hopkins University."
3435,The death rate from COVID-19 in Los Angeles County — the nation's most populous and an epicenter of the state pandemic — works out to about one person every six minutes.
3436,"On Sunday, the South Coast Air Quality Management District suspended some pollution-control limits on the number of cremations for at least 10 days in order to deal with a backlog of bodies at hospitals and funeral homes."
3437,"""The current rate of death is more than double that of pre-pandemic years,"" the agency said."
3438,"California has had about 500 deaths and 40,000 new cases daily for the past two weeks."
3439,"Although hospitalizations and intensive care unit admissions remained on a slight downward trend, officials have warned that could reverse when the full impact from transmissions during Christmas and New Year's Eve gatherings is felt."
3440,"""As case numbers continue to rise in California, the total number of individuals who will have serious outcomes will also increase,"" the state Department of Public Health said in a statement Sunday."
3441,"Adding to concerns, California is experiencing new, possibly more transmissible forms of COVID-19."
3442,The state health department announced Sunday that an L452R variant of the virus is increasingly showing up in genetic sequencing of COVID-19 test samples from several counties.
3443,"The variant was first identified last year in California and in other states and countries but has been identified more frequently since November and in several large outbreaks in Northern California's Santa Clara County, the department said."
3444,"Overall, the variant has been found in at least a dozen counties."
3445,In some places.
3446,"testing has found the variant in a quarter of the samples sequenced, said Dr. Charles Chiu, a virologist and professor of laboratory medicine at the University of California San Francisco."
3447,"However, not all test samples receive genetic sequencing to identify variants so its frequency wasn't immediately clear."
3448,"However, health officials said it was linked to a Christmas-time outbreak at Kaiser Permanente San Jose that infected at least 89 staff members and patients, killing a receptionist."
3449,The outbreak has been blamed on an employee who visited the hospital emergency room wearing an air-powered inflatable Christmas tree costume.
3450,"The variant is different from another mutation, B117, that was first reported in the United Kingdom and appears to spread much more easily, although it doesn't appear to make people sicker."
3451,That variant has already shown up in San Diego County and Los Angeles County announced over the weekend that it had detected its first case.
3452,I wonder if pure nicotine from vaping does the same thing.
3453,How can someone be so gullible
3454,You do realise australia is accepting and constantly bringing citizens back home dont you?
3455,"I wouldnt be using europe as coming back to its senses when there are countries now, including where my family come from that cant even access a hospital if they get a serious case of coronavirus."
3456,Thats actually more disturbing and unethical than australia being tactful and careful about how we allow people back into the country.
3457,It also will very much depend on how the vaccine goes so this may change as time goes on.

3471,*
3472,I'm out of the loop.
3473,Can someone explain me why will masks and distancing be needed long after the whole population is vaccinated?
3474,"Also, if I get the vaccine, can I be infected and spread it to ones at home?"
3475,"No, right?"
3476,Is it confirmed?
3477,Thank you.
3478,If Bush had appointed a director of FEMA that had experience with emergency management instead of a crony of an ex campaign manager he wouldn’t have received as much as the blame that he did.
3479,I think the best place to get that information would be your hospital or wherever you’re receiving your shot.
3480,I don’t know if anyone on Reddit could give you a better answer than them.
3481,If you’re already prioritized in your current state for a second shot I’d think it wise to simply stay and ensure that you get your shot.
3482,"Other than that I, nor most people here, shouldn’t be giving any advice."
3483,Do you need it before others?
3484,"Even the guy in the article who they quoted isn’t quoted saying “it’s more resistant to vaccines.” He just said “it has three mutations on the spike protein, which the vaccine targets.” Then the author just sort of editorializes that it therefore could be more resistant to the vaccine."
3485,"That’s quite a conclusion for the writer, who I assume isn’t a scientist since the article is from a Hollywood gossip site, to jump to."
3486,I higher risk but since NJ just moved smokers ahead of everyone my guess is I'll be getting a shot around summer.
3487,Close your eyes and imagine if Trump would have issued a nationwide stay at home order on March 1.
3488,"Now tell me what you think the response would have been from NY, CA, MI, WI..."
3489,This.
3490,But not only because he has become a lockdown zealot but because people in CA won’t get a vaccine until 2022 at this rate.
3491,Holy shit this needs to be reported to the news or something.
3492,Maybe that'll force them to change.
3493,"""No alternative cause of death noted"" is the key part."
3494,"If someone has Covid and is on a ventilator and dies of ARDS, the ME is going to list ARDS as the cause of death"
3495,"""Death Counts: Deaths reported by UDOH include confirmed and probable cases as defined by the Council of State and Territorial Epidemiologists (CSTE) case definition."
3496,"This includes: 1) confirmed cases with a positive COVID-19 PCR result and no alternative cause of death noted on the death certificate or reported by the Office of the Medical Examiner (OME), 2) probable cases where the death certificate lists COVID-19 disease or SARS-CoV-2 as a cause of death or a significant condition contributing to death and no alternative cause of death reported by the OME, and 3) probable cases with COVID-19 symptoms and close contact to a laboratory confirmed case and no alternative cause of death reported by the OME or the death certificate."
3497,"Death counts are provisional and subject to change as investigations are completed."""
3498,Despite having 50 million+ doses in stockpile India haven't even vaccinated a million.
3499,Kudos to Israel
3500,Belgium complained pfizer delivered 7k vaccines less than promised.
3501,They have 180k stocked in freezers.
3502,People are going to be soooo pissed about this.
3503,It’s too soon to tell people this.
3504,Just ask yourself:  if we’re all so unsure about whether or not they block any transmission how in the world are we talking about herd immunity at any point then?
3505,It would be impossible.
3506,How are we talking about vaccinating 85% by Fall when kids under 12 make up at least 15%?
3507,Stop thinking every word that comes out of whatever professional interviewee you see is unfiltered truth.
3508,A lot of it is meant to manage and sometimes even manipulate the public.
3509,That tweet doesn't say it's not H2H transmissible.
3510,I can try to find it.
3511,"It's on the state's department of health website, or at least it was a couple months ago when I looked it up to figure out how the hell our case fatality rate was unreasonably low"
3512,"I quote the tweet: ""Preliminary investigations conducted by the Chinese authorities have found no clear evidence of human-to-human transmission of the novel #coronavirus (2019-nCoV) identified in #Wuhan,""

It says that China says that they have no clear information..."
3513,"Sorry, but this is a correct Information."
3514,It doesnt say that WHO has information that this virus has with no doubt no human to human transmission.
3515,"""China... preliminary"" 

The second part of your comment is not an argument but an ad hominem."
3516,Of course they tried to play it down.
3517,Most of the time there is only rumor but no deadly pandemic.
3518,It has been like this for 100 years.
3519,"And all the experts I was listening to said that China was pretty open about the virus this time (other than SARS1), the guys from This week in virology, Prof Drosten in Germany."
3520,I even saw the hearing in congress in february and the expert said that she didnt see any mistake China made that wouldnt have been done in any other country in the world.

3522,I was able to do that when the rest of my immediate family got it.
3523,"We just were very careful and followed the guidelines:

-Masks

-Isolating

-Keep air well-circulated, etc."
3524,There is also the chance of false negatives from asymptomatic individuals.
3525,"I got tested negative 7 days after my sibling first tested positive and I never really had symptoms, but maybe I had it and it didn't show."
3526,The *entire* declaration of independence](https://i.imgur.com/uTZZLMv.jpg)
3527,Exact same thing here except I dared to suggest that typically vaccines work by preventing infection and therefore transmission.
3528,I guess I need to hand over my PhD as well.
3529,"&gt; It means you were exposed to COVID and it infected a few of your cells, but it's very possible at that stage that your innate immune system just dispatches it."
3530,You'll have no antibody response.
3531,You'll have no immunity.
3532,"However, you might still test positive on PCR."
3533,There's no evidence that this is something that happens.
3534,PCR is sensitive but not that sensitive.
3535,"If you test positive one day and negative a couple of days later, the scenarios are:  
1) You had a short course of asymptomatic COVID and you'll have immunity

2) You were infected awhile ago and have basically recovered, but are still shedding traces of viral debris

3) You had a rare false positive"
3536,This is what a slow-mo Apocalypse feels like I guess.
3537,"As far as politicians go, the finger point came before the point of having fingers."
3538,"Thank you, I hope you do too."
3539,must be hell to be hating on your own ethnicity because there's nothing you can do about it.
3540,"also it probably feels amazing to live amongst poorer people, makes you feel superior."
3541,Christ!
3542,Let the kids cheat.
3543,While we won't know for a few more times it's quite possible the US may have already peaked in terms of new cases.
3544,We had 300k cases on January 8th and it's been 10 days and we haven't broken that record yet.
3545,It's possible the darkest day may already be behind us.
3546,"The Democrat's first play was to call Trump a racist xenophobe for banning travel from China, before things got real."
3547,After that they switched to caring about logic.
3548,Infuriating if true.
3549,Almost as infuriating as the west's response to control the virus.
3550,"Our concept of freedom is totally skewed, and perhaps the healthcare workers have a bit different opinion on freedom."
3551,"Freedom should not be ""do what you want""."
3552,"It should be ""Do what you want, as long as your actions don't remove the same right from others."""
3553,"But covid has shown surprisingly high number of people take any excuse they can to act like animals I guess.. the virus is spread ONLY by human behavior, nothing else."
3554,"Let that sink in, because it is pretty clear at this point it hasn't sunk in for so many individuals."
3555,"It's almost pointless to blame governments, officials and politicians (albeit them having a huge responsibility in downplaying this) when you go to parties and run around maskless."

3559,"Also, the WHO’s forceful stance against border controls."
3560,"For months, they claimed such measures would just make things worse: https://www.bbc.com/news/world-51338899

In the end, the countries with the most successful response to the virus are those that went hard and early with border control and quarantine measures."
3561,"Had these been enacted properly across-the-board, the pandemic would have been slowed dramatically."
3562,Can these anti-mask morons just suck on some goddamn cardboard already?
3563,"That way they can can still act like an idiot and no one else is affected, its really a win win"

3566,I don't think he is able to file taxes cause it's under the table sort of
3567,No way really to know how bad covid is doing in Africa when they aren't able to do testing.
3568,I'll bet it is as bad there as it is anywhere
3569,"It's a good question, kind of like the new flu shot every year doesn't have to go through a full clinical trial even though it's for whatever strain they think will be predominant."
3570,"Even then, half the sites I order from advertise their Covid-19 safety measures, or apologize that orders are taking longer than usual for to Covid-19."
3571,Same in NY.
3572,"Seriously, what was the point in throwing out your projected death numbers at us ?"
3573,"I mean,really"
3574,"Ah yes, your anecdotal results from a 2 person sample clearly supercedes all other existing data."
3575,Vitamin D and lifestyle choices most likely play an important role in your body's ability to fight off the virus or mitigate your risk of symptoms at all.
3576,"There are, however, far more variables at play"
3577,This type of commitment to data and metrics would highlight the constant goal post moving.
3578,This would be a drastic shift current public health strategy.
3579,"One difference could be that the vaccines are currently injected into the muscle, so there may be a difference in [antibodies in the mucous membranes of the nose and throat](https://stm.sciencemag.org/content/early/2020/12/04/scitranslmed.abf1555)."
3580,"We'll probably see the next generation of SARS-CoV-2 vaccines focusing on intranasal delivery for this reason, is my guess."
3581,EDIT: Here's a [less science-ey article](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/14/health/coronavirus-nasal-vaccines.html) on the subject.
3582,Too true.
3583,"And most providers forget to mention that you can still get ""wild pox"" even when vaccinated."
3584,"The varicella vaccine does make it much milder, but it can definitely still happen."
3585,I get really annoyed with people who look at the past and try to second guess the experts' decisions and advice over this year.
3586,"If leading scientists *don't know* how it reacts, or transmits, or how best to treat it, their best guesses at the *beginning of the pandemic* are Informed Choices, but they are still just theories until proven or disproven."
3587,[removed]
3588,He should file his taxes ASAP.
3589,Even if he didn't have any income he should file taxes stating that he had zero income.
3590,That will probably be the quickest way to get his stimulus.
3591,"Yes of course I know about skin tone (I mentioned it, and also the study was of people of European ancenstry)."
3592,"My understanding is that up until \~100 years ago life was really hard in Europe, I wouldn't take it for granted that families with bad vit D systems could survive and multiply if, for example, it undermined their immune system."
3593,And that's the whole question.
3594,"BUT, even if these people with bad vit D systems are alive and doing fine, maybe their immune systems found another way to work with minimal vit D.  In that case, their experience should not be generalized to people whose bodies are not built that way, but whose vit D is low because e.g."
3595,they're in a nursing home.
3596,And my main point was that it makes no sense to bring in all this genetic stuff anyway.
3597,Just test blood levels.
3598,Or get credit card/Amazon records and compare the % of people who buy vitamin D regularly who suddenly stopped buying anything at all (i.e.
3599,"died), and compare that to the % of people overall who died."
3600,That's a direct measure of the thing you're trying to evaluate.
3601,"Much better approach than bringing in genomics and all these assumptions and unanswered questions, and figuring out which of the infinitely complex inter-relations need to be controled for and how."
3602,These authors are being very clever and very lazy.
3603,"I know it when I see it, because *that's my MO too*."
3604,But what do I know.
3605,Maybe this is brilliant science and I'm too dumb to see it.
3606,But I think they should just test patient's vitamin D levels.
3607,If the numbers are as lopsided as other studies suggest.... correlation != causation etc.
3608,etc.
3609,But wouldn't that be an anomally worth looking into?
3610,California on Monday became the first state to record more than 3 million known coronavirus infections.
3611,"The grim milestone, as tallied by Johns Hopkins University, wasn’t entirely unexpected in a state with 40 million residents but its speed stunning."
3612,The state only reached 2 million reported cases on Dec. 24.
3613,Honestly if you were willing to *prove* that to her you may have remedied the entire situation
3614,Maybe they count administered vaccines per 100.
3615,It's around 30 per 100 inhabitants currently (29.43).
3616,"But this includes the second dose as well, so one would be mistaken to say 30% because it's 30 per 100 inhabitants."
3617,"However it would be correct, if only the first one has been administered yet."
3618,"Anyway, you are right, they are wrong."
3619,This is very consistent with the entire handling of the pandemic.
3620,"Public Health Message:
We don't know if the vaccine prevents transmission so keep wearing a mask."
3621,"Scientists:
It is likely that the vaccine will reduce transmission of the virus."
3622,Mederna even submitted data to the FDA showing this.
3623,Unfortunately public health message and science are not the same thing.
3624,What do you mean “wear a mask till then”?
3625,I thought the current orders are we still have to wear masks even after we get vaccinated...
3626,Happy Cakeday!

3653,I’ve made a wonderful life for myself in Arizona and can actually afford to buy a house and build a life here.
3654,And I never have to shovel snow in this part of Arizona and the sun actually shines so I don’t want to constantly kill myself like I did in the place I grew up where winter lasted 8 months and the sun almost never shined.
3655,I am also surrounded by college educated hard working people who bust their ass for everything they have and enjoy the beautiful nature we have here.
3656,Maybe you’re just not in a decent part of the state but there’s a lot to offer here.
3657,oh i thought we were comparing the average chinese and average filipino.
3658,"if you are comparing you, then why aren't you comparing to the 500+ billionaires in china?"
3659,imagine thinking living in manila is better than living in shanghai/beijing/shenzhen.
3660,even third tier cities are more modern and advanced than any filipino city.

3662,imagine actually living in a country that's named after a spanish king.
3663,i cannot imagine.
3664,"A variant could emerge, then, from the training ground of a chronic infection, with mutations that make the virus better at binding to cells and thus more transmissible."
3665,This may be what happened with the U.K. variant.
3666,It could also emerge slightly more capable of reinfection.
3667,"This may be what’s happening in Brazil, where there are already two documented cases of reinfection with the new variant."
3668,"In a place where many people have already been infected with COVID-19, a variant that is just a little better at evading preexisting immunity will have an advantage."

3702,"You misread, there was no Thanksgiving get-together."
3703,"&gt;""We never got together as a large family, never got together for holidays, birthdays.”

Rather, the man's daughter and her husband, a pilot, got sick the week before Thanksgiving from somewhere unspecified:

&gt;But the week before Thanksgiving, his daughter and her husband, a pilot,  got sick with what they thought was a cold."
3704,Salvaggio and his wife cared for their 15-month-old grandson while his parents recuperated.
3705,But then the baby started running a fever.
3706,"So the transmission wasn't at a Thanksgiving party, but providing childcare for a baby with sick parents."
3707,"Obviously grocery shopping or other essential tasks could have introduced the virus too, but the easiest explanation is what's given in the article."
3708,"I've seen a few of these situations, where an essential worker leaves childcare to the grandparents because there's no other option, and the Rona spreads that way."
3709,"Thankfully in this case, grandpa had the vaccine."

3746,"Only three states have estimates above 1.1, compared to nearly every state being 1.1-1.2 three months ago."
3747,"We put up a bunch of surge hospitals all around the city, which we never used, and then just closed them down."
3748,"And, while some hospitals came close to being overrun, many city hospitals were well under capacity, because nobody bothered to coordinate between the five major NYC hospital systems."
3749,"So Elmhurst was a war zone and IZ had patients in every spare corner, while nurses were dying of boredom in hospitals fifteen minutes away by ambulance."
3750,"When this thing is over, I hope we have a 9/11 style commission, after which Oxiris Barbot and Howard Zucker and Dan O’Hara and Deanne Criswell should never be allowed to show their faces in public every again."
3751,"Oh, and Criswell is apparently Biden’s pick to head up FEMA, because she apparently did such a great fucking job running the Coronavirus shitshow."
3752,"Smart move, I fully support this."
3753,A single dose is far better than nothing.
3754,Tedros wouldn't know morality if it bit him in the ass.
3755,FYI if you are a smoker some states will give you a free vaccine right now.
3756,I'm not sure if smoking weed counts though.
3757,But it might be worth a shot asking.
3758,My issue with it is really abvout the genetic predisposition thing - are people really predisposed to being vitamin D deficient?
3759,"If so, it seems really likely that it's part of a cluster of things like obesity, skin tone etc."
3760,They had to exclude that from their analysis to avoid multi-correlation problems.
3761,"After you've excluded those factors, what are you left with?"
3762,People who were randomly Vitamin D deficient that year (maybe they spent the summer working an office job?)
3763,"And even if there is some congenital hypo-vitamin D condition, then that's a factor itself."
3764,"Maybe people with that condition just need less Vit D than others, their bodies and their immune systems are more efficient that way, they're not deficient, they just need less than ""normal"" people."
3765,And the approach is just so convoluted... why not measure the Vit D levels of hospital patients?
3766,"Why bring in a complex analysis with 1000 assumptions, adjustments and other possible points of failure?"
3767,And the fact that Vit D is recommended anyway... but I guess that gets outside the scope of the paper.
3768,"They don't do a cost/risk/benefit analysis, all they say is that this supports the idea that it doesn't do anything."
3769,So they'll get their names cited in papers and they'll move up the ladder.
3770,It would be interesting to know how well their model predicts actual Vit D deficiency.
3771,"They should take some samples, and if they can't find a statistically significant relationship between their control-hobbled model and actual levels then this paper should go straight into the shredder."
3772,As far as I can tell Dr Fauci is the only person of note that has received the Moderna vaccine.
3773,Everyone else has gotten Pfizer.
3774,I live up here.
3775,Can confirm Red Bluff is a shithole
3776,That’s rich 😂.
3777,"If all the nurses who felt this way left their careers, we wouldn’t have many nurses left haha."
3778,"If these people want to ignore the quarantine guidelines and not wear masks, that’s their decision but then they shouldn’t seek medical care when they get sick."
3779,Why should healthcare workers put themselves at increased risk for their decision?
3780,"Why should people having heart attacks, strokes, and other serious medical emergencies have to deal with a delay in care because these morons ignored the guidelines and overwhelmed the healthcare system after they catch COVID?"
3781,?
3782,We are also on our 7th day straight of declining hospitalization.
3783,"I dont think this is just a blip, I think its heading down for real."
3784,Only question is how fast and how low it needs to get for us to stop caring about it.
3785,"One of the big misnomers about COVID is the idea that you ""have it"" or ""don't have it."""
3786,"You can have COVID-19 replicating in your URT, but that doesn't mean you ""have COVID."""
3787,"It means you were exposed to COVID and it infected a few of your cells, but it's very possible at that stage that your innate immune system just dispatches it."
3788,You'll have no antibody response.
3789,You'll have no immunity.
3790,"However, you might still test positive on PCR."
3791,Not saying that's what happened with Musk.
3792,"Indeed, these tests may not have been amazing."
3793,Sometimes the tests are simply not great.
3794,"People forget that sensitivity/specificity can look great, but if a disease has low prevalence, then PPV and NPV, the metrics that matter to the individual, will be way out of whack."
3795,Herpes stigma is so 1980’s.

3810,He’s not being reasonable if he thinks that’s going to happen
3811,&gt;The guy who got the vaccine was a pharmacist who interacts with different people everyday.
3812,The pharmacist was retired and the article never stated if he was doing a side gig with his credentials.
3813,But what's in the safe?
3814,Even Healthcare workers are buying into this now.
3815,"I get it's important to not let our guard up, but once the vaccine is generally available, mask wearing should be gone."

3822,"CDC was trying to quarantine people coming off flights, but people just said ""Nah"" and ignored them."
3823,"At that point in time, I think a couple of other countries also were blocking direct flights from China."
3824,People stuck there had to scramble for flights to get around it and to get back home to various countries.
3825,"It made sense, at that time, to block direct flights."
3826,But the virus was already in the US so it didnt matter in hindsight.
3827,New York was getting hammered first by a variant from Europe.
3828,"The vaccines were tested &amp; known to stop severe cases of covid... there’s not been data on asymptomatic cases, longterm damage, and transmission... so the trial participant being negative for covid when tested is great news... hopefully data on this stuff will be available by February/March."

3840,lmao for real tho
3841,&gt; Serious question: what other vaccine ever has not stopped transmission of a virus (for people who mount an immune response)?
3842,Has that ever happened to an appreciable degree?

3869,"The guy in the article did get infected with COVID-19 through the respiratory route, but the body developed enough antibodies from the vaccine to neutralize the virus that the guy didn't feel anything."
3870,Everyone still needs to know that you can get COVID-19 after getting the 1st shot because it takes 14 days for the body to develop enough IgG to combat the virus.
3871,The time frame is true for vaccines in general.
3872,It's the same reason you get people saying they got sick from said vaccine like the flu shot which is not true.
3873,Sure /r/LouderWithCrowder regular.

3884,You are literally comparing us pre-pandemic data to pandemic data with lockdowns and masks.
3885,The flu is basically non-existent this year.
3886,So you trying to compare the two is still not really that relevant.
3887,I gave the other poster the data because he asked for it.
3888,You however are one of those people that say this is less severe than the flu lol.
3889,"New York has been allocated the 6th most doses per 100k residents according to the CDC data tracker, but they’re #18 on percent of supply used."
3890,When Operation Warp Speed was about to begin all I heard was that supply would be distributed based on population to make things fair.
3891,But it hasn’t been — there are significant variations in allocation.
3892,For example Oklahoma has received 10715 doses per 100k and South Carolina has received 6808 doses per 100k.
3893,I have seen no reporting as to how they’re deciding who gets what each week.
3894,Have I missed it?
3895,This seems like an important policy topic.
3896,"Anyway, I wonder if states might start receiving a bit less supply if they’re not administering it quickly."
3897,No point sending more doses than can be used.
3898,"Like for example, why send more doses than were administered last week to a state if they’re already reporting &lt;50% administered."
3899,If a slow state gets their system improved and catches up they could get more allocation as soon as they hit a certain metric.

3916,"I'm sure you're also aware that Florida was over a month behind in reporting covid-19 to deaths, I don't know how much of a delay that they have four deaths of all causes but that could be particularly relevant especially as they've had some data issues and legal cases revolving around that."

3940,"For example if i am not vaccinated and asymptomatic, and it takes my body ten days to clear itself of the virus, I could walk around spreading it for ten days, but if i am vaccinated and get the virus, does my immune system eradicate it faster?"

4057,You are talking about shutting down a city of 11 millions people.
4058,No way anyone could  make such a decision within less than 1 month of a new virus.
4059,Remember no one else had the same shut down that they enforced.
4060,"While I agree that the USA needs national healthcare, it’s just untrue that a “majority” of Americans don’t have it and can’t adford a hospital stay for covid."
4061,It’s an absolute travesty that any American doesn’t have insurance but to claim that anywhere near a majority are going to be bankrupted by medical covid costs is rather silly.
4062,Most Americans still have healthcare that just leaves copays and most of any covid treatment and medicine is covered given it’s not really tied with the big pharma scam drugs (yet.)
4063,America is still very rich on average and people still have healthcare for the most part
4064,It covers it.
4065,"If you have no health insurance in Germany, you're clearly doing something wrong."

4069,Why don’t you tell me what data to look for and what analysis to run so that I can verify your conclusions?
4070,If you’re right it should be big news!

4093,The article includes an embedded link to the JAMA study/data set that was shared by the Twitter user you’re referencing.
4094,"That article contains the following rather ominous passage in the results summary: 

“At the end of the study, Hawaii and New Hampshire had the lowest rates [of pediatric COVID hospitalizations] at 4.3 and 3.4 per 100 000 respectively and South Dakota and Arizona had the highest rates at 33.7 and 32.8 per 100 000.” 

Compared to the lower hospitalization rates at the start of the study, I’d say that seems consistent with an increase in pediatric COVID hospitalizations in Arizona, right?"
4095,Am I missing something?
4096,It’s got nothing to do with conserving the vaccine.
4097,It’s to be able to give it to as many people as possible so a wider range of people have some protection rather than smaller group having the full protection and others having none.

4155,I don’t think you quite understand how clinical trials work or what they’re used in if you think AIDS treatments don’t have clinical trials... trials aren’t just limited to vaccines.
4156,As far as I know all trials have a placebo group (the not vaccinated) and a group who receives what is being studied (the vaccine).
4157,This is to make sure that it’s truly working and someone’s not fudging the data.
4158,For example mother was in a clinical trial for a type of treatment lymphoma cancer three years back.
4159,It was a new way they were treating it after having seen success in Germany.
4160,They were replicating the process at a few hospitals one of which was hers.
4161,Just like with the vaccine there was a placebo group.
4162,The way her doctors explained it to us is the point of having the two groups was to help verify the data seen from the hospital in Germany.
4163,So if it worked they could start expanding the program into other hospitals as a form of treatment for her particular cancer.
4164,As for your example of AIDS.
4165,I won’t admit to understanding how a vaccine for that would work.
4166,However there are trials out there for them.
4167,"Here’s a link talking about the history of attempts: [AIDS Vaccine](https://www.niaid.nih.gov/diseases-conditions/hiv-vaccine-research-history)

So they obviously must have some way of making it work."
4168,Such an autistic sub
4169,"They were referencing actual vaccines, not per capita and at least [according to Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/covid-vaccine-tracker-global-distribution/), the US is number one with 14.7 million versus 10 million for China and 4.5 million for the UK, which is a pretty sizable gap."
4170,"In per capita (the more meaningful stat) we are 5th behind Israel, the UAE, Bahrain and the U.K. so not great but not terrible."
4171,&gt;At the current rate we won't hit herd immunity until 2025.
4172,Laughable hyperbole.
4173,"Per Bloomberg again, the US has administered 776,901 doses a day over the past week."
4174,Assuming some hypothetical world where that rate never increased we would  administer enough vaccines to vaccinate 560 million people by 2025.
4175,Of course we live in the real world where the rate of doses being administered has been increasing and should continue to increase with the largest hurdle being a break in the supply of either vaccine before a third is approved.

4327,"OK, so I think it's on the point here, that is the complete lack of an unbiased, transparent pipeline of Chinese news to international audience."
4328,"For example, at the beginning of the pandemic, when there's still a lot of speculations of the virus, the Wuhan authority, later taken over by the Chinese authority, published a brief on the situation daily, including the new findings and new cases, do you see any media translating that information?"
4329,"Since I can read Chinese, I saw a lot of proceedings that appeared again and again here as ""new discovery""."
4330,What was all the media doing then?

4361,"I feel very helpful today and I'll just send you a couple grabs from there that show what's the most important points:

[Here](https://ibb.co/TRGTZ4K) is an overview of a sample of 5 european countries with very different restrictions during the second wave (Italy and Spain are the harshest, followed by Slovenia, then Norway and of course Sweden)."
4362,"Z-score on the Y axis, time on Y."
4363,Seemingly no correlation.
4364,Feel free to play around with euromomo and pick and match yourself if you want.
4365,"Or ask them for data - again, I'm sure they will provide it."
4366,"And, even more interestingly, [here](https://ibb.co/5Kj7scJ) is an aggregate graph that shows excess deaths for all european country, excess deaths on the Y axis (note that it starts at around 40k)."
4367,Deaths during the second wave are in line with a medium-harsh flu season.
4368,One would jump from correlation to causation and say that if there is no correlation between measures strictness and excess deaths then measures are ineffective.
4369,"If they are, it means that there would be little difference between doing all we're doing now and nothing (where nothing is something Sweden level)."
4370,"If that's true, looking at the total excess deaths we've experienced (which is nothing statistically unusual year over year) it means we're overreacting big time."
4371,But I'm not one that jumps from correlation to causation lightly.
4372,"I'm done handholding now, if you *really* want to get a better idea around what's going on you have all you need."
4373,"I sort of get the feeling that you're not, but either way I'm done."
4374,"No, touching food surface and packages."
4375,Can we call it the ‘Bavariant?’
4376,I think the real reason was that it will be impossible to to know who was already vaccinated and who wasn't.
4377,And people who don't want to be vaccinated are also the ones who will be first to not wear masks.
4378,Slightly related is that media didn't talk about mutations until we got a vaccine.
4379,"As if virus started mutating now when it learned that we have a vaccine (note, at least all mutations I heard about are still covered by the vaccine, because vaccine only concentrates on the spike protein (from which the name corona originates) and that spike is harder for the virus to mutate)"
4380,Field Hospitals from the Army are ICU and not something fishy and they come with super-specialized Personal!

4383,Once they got their plexiglass protect up it became a free for all.
4384,It’s not like those clerks need another reason to get shot.
4385,I'm curious if anyone read the article or actually lives in New York and knows what's going on.
4386,Cuomo is mad because the federal government made it sound like there was this stockpile of vaccines being saved for later just waiting to be released.
4387,"At the same time, the CDC updated its guidelines to recommend that substantially more people be eligible to get the vaccine."
4388,So New York followed suit and then found out that they're getting LESS vaccines this week than before and that this national stockpile doesn't exist.
4389,"They can't just go back and cancel all of these appointments and revert the eligibility, so now they're stuck in a position where some of those who need it most can't get it because it's next to impossible to find open appointments."
4390,"And for everyone who's commenting on the ratio of vaccines received vs distributed, I'm fairly certain that includes all 2nd doses, which New York immediately puts to the side to ensure that every person who gets their first dose gets their second dose on time."
4391,"Not necessarily the case with COVID as it's peak of transmission is during an asymptomatic period or on the day of symptom onset, in other words it doesn't really 'care' whether its host dies or not."
4392,Nah.
4393,He just needs to immigrate to the US where he will blend in.
4394,Yes.
4395,I think that one you have to have a good reason to use it.
4396,If you aren't in one of the categories that doesn't file taxes you just file a normal return with 0 income afaik.
4397,How about we start maskless when the time is right and everyone offered a vaccine has been vaccinated.
4398,Just to see how that goes.
4399,"If you see cases start to increase, by all means, mask up."
4400,A masked society shouldn't be the default
4401,Should have worn your mask.
4402,Now you can’t enjoy your pizza.
4403,"You eat it, but you don’t enjoy it."
4404,Like I said...in colleges and schools in the UK masks are not worn at desks (even when sharing a desk with other students).
4405,"In exams though students would be considered socially distanced enough, so it would be a non-issue."
4406,It is what it is....

4409,"People were complaining 1A wasn’t working, and now we see more loosening to include 65 and older outside of 1A."
4410,"But we are still seeing vials being tossed, so they need to expand to 50 and over then put all essential workers regardless of age in phone registries."
4411,"Guaranteed Apple and Samsung already know millions of essential workers by tracking their cells (they know the demo, place of work, their schedules, etc)."
4412,This is how reporting in a democracy works.
4413,Sometimes it’s hysteria; in this case I think it’s appropriate.
4414,"In the UK at least, the decision for a delayed second dose was weighed up against the lives lost of unvaccinated people, with fewer deaths in the delayed setting."
4415,This is especially true considering we’re now in a worse situation than our first peak.
4416,Not everything is cut and dry.
4417,"When it's safe for everyone, then opening up for everyone is fine."
4418,That's different to opening up just for the vaccinated.
4419,That would not work
4420,Can you point to the specific calculations or quotes in your source that substantiate your claim that “there's no correlation between lockdown strictness and deaths”?
4421,"Are you willing to admit you may be wrong, and that the scientific study concluding “stricter lockdown policies are associated with fewer COVID-19 deaths” may be right?"

4430,"I would just gently challenge you though and say, what restrictions, exactly?"
4431,"Last I checked, I can go on vacation to 95% of countries I could go to before the pandemic."
4432,"in 45/50 states I can go eat at restaurants, go to movie theaters, and hang out with friends."
4433,"Other than mandatory mask wearing, which is a pretty minor inconvenience, there is no real restrictions unless you live in California or the handful of other similar nanny states."

4436,They technically had it too
4437,It's a behavioral nudge to avoid vaccinated people not wearing masks encouraging unvaccinated people not to wear masks.
4438,But the perverse consequence of this messaging is that it's causing more people to refuse the vaccine because they think it will change nothing.
4439,"As always, these nudges never really work so well."
4440,you watch too much CNN and BBC ken
4441,"&gt; Abbott has also said that in “numerous studies,” both the Panbio rapid antigen test and its ID NOW rapid molecular test have demonstrated sensitivity above 90 per cent when used on a person when they are most contagious."
4442,"&gt; They screen people who are contagious out of our community, so that those people don’t go around spreading COVID to everyone else."
4443,"I probably won't even get the option to get vaccinated until fall/winter, though..."
4444,I think the issue is politicians are threatening their medical licenses.
4445,"Now personally I think these should have no teeth to it as politicians know dick all about medicine, but the idea is no one wants to be the test case."
4446,"I didn’t say it wasn’t irrational, just not surprising."
4447,&gt; We need to vaccinated at least 60-70% of our community in order to virtually eliminate COVID from spreading.
4448,"But to remove restrictions we just need to vaccinate the vulnerable groups, because the point of the restrictions is to stop hospitals from being overwhelmed."
4449,"We don't need to wait until ""full herd immunity"" which will take longer."

4457,I mean so won't Europeans for the US.
4458,"And millions more are sharing the contrary, that Trump lost, particularly those who know what they’re talking about."
4459,"Your Trump example would be fit for an example closer to “some random guy at a bar saying that they’re not testing enough.”

However, just as there are many qualified individuals saying that Trump lost, there are also many qualified individuals (doctors and nurses who are actually experiencing this) who are saying that testing isn’t being done, in any relative frequency, even for those working directly with covid patients."
4460,"We can disagree on where the line is in regards to “anecdotal evidence” becoming “proof,” but facts are facts."
4461,They’re just not testing as much as they should be.
4462,Still doing better than the US though.

4483,flu can for one.
4484,One study found over 70% of people had antibodies at the end of flu season yet had not had the shot and could not recall symptoms.
4485,"cite:
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asymptomatic_carrier 
&gt;Asymptomatic carriers play a critical role in the transmission of common infectious diseases such as typhoid, HIV, C. difficile, influenzas, cholera, tuberculosis and COVID-19,[2] 


https://www.nationalgeographic.com/science/2020/07/why-do-asymptomatic-coronavirus-cases-even-happen-cvd/

&gt;Although people infected with other, well-known diseases can transmit them asymptomatically, too, it tends to be overlooked among scientists because studies usually focus on those who are seriously sick."
4486,&gt;One 2019 community study tried to document this underground spread.
4487,"The project tested 214 people weekly at multiple locations throughout New York City for 18 different respiratory viruses, such as influenza, and a slate of cold-causing germs including some coronaviruses."
4488,"In the course of a year and a half, the researchers found that a whopping 55 percent of positive cases were symptom-free, and asymptomatic infection rates exceeded 70 percent for most of the viruses."
4489,They actually developed the vaccines mere days after mapping the genome of the virus.
4490,It took a year to test and get approval.
4491,Bro just quarantine for 6 more weeks to stop the spread!!!!
4492,!
4493,Cuomo is over here acting like New York is a country and he’s the King.
4494,"It's like Oprah giving away free variants to all countries in the world: ""you get a variant, you get a variant..!"
4495,!
4496,Yea 20%-30% or possibly even more of people are asymptomatic.
4497,Some people have extremely mild symptoms and don't even notice.
4498,The issue with COVID is that some asymptomatic people can be as contagious as a person showing symptoms.
4499,"They don't take precautions, thinking they are uninfected, and end up infecting others who are not as lucky."
4500,"Then again, chance of infection from living in the same household is lower than 20%."
4501,Only 38% for spouses not isolating.
4502,It's relatively common to not become infected even if your entire house has it.
4503,Please do tell how Newsom botched it.
4504,It makes perfect sense to get your own house in order first so you can better help others afterwards.

4597,fingers cross cases continually decline!
4598,Exactly... to stop spread bigtime we need the immunity to be in the nose... not deep in the blood/body/lungs.
4599,And that's a different trick than the vaccines we got on the truck right now.

4619,It's really not unusual here (Tokyo).
4620,I go out and probably 10-25% of people aren't wearing a mask.
4621,Every single time I enter a store there is at least one or two people without a mask.
4622,Every subway car has a few as well.
4623,One bank tried mandating mask wearing and got so much blowback they rescinded the order within a day.
4624,Ain't that the truth
4625,It's not clear what titers are needed to prevent transmission.
4626,I believe the Pfizer vaccine gives you a titer about 150 which is probably not enough to do it.
4627,For most vaccines you need to get about 10 times the amount of antibodies that you would need to protect yourself for sterilizing immunity.
4628,Somewhere around 20 to 40 is what's needed for immunity it seems.
4629,Pfizer gives you 150...
4630,The only one that I've seen that would come close to or at the 10 times ratio is Novavax.
4631,I believe having a second dose of J&amp;J will get you there as well but a single dose won't do it

4976,It's been almost a year of this shit and people are still arguing.
4977,"This must have been a very exhausting year for these COVID denying and ""open-up"" morons."
4978,"Their positivity rate is within the guidelines for over and under testing, and closer to over than under for the entirety of the pandemic and if they're only testing those with covid exposures this would skew the data towards a higher % of positive cases and not a lower one."
4979,In the past weeks they've breached the 10% rate which is indicative of undertesting and have since gone back below the 10% mark.
4980,That’s still abusive.
4981,She has very misplaced authority.
4982,Parents should not be allowed to stop their children from thriving due to their own personal fear.
4983,&gt; What would happen if we aren't able to create vaccines for Covid?
4984,"Honestly we'd mask and social distance until the public decided ""enough is enough we're just living with this""."
4985,"There's a difference between avoiding political news like CNN, and not watching the local news in general"
4986,i ran into a group of guys vaccinating each other under an overpass.
4987,"they were kind enough to share a dose with me, and i can report the only side effects were an immediate rush of warmth, feelings of euphoria, and some mild hallucinations."
4988,actually quite pleasant overall.

5011,"Whatever though, close enough."

5026,"If it were, people probably wouldn’t even consider getting in a car."
5027,"Plus, we have all kinds of safety measures and regulations to make driving as safely as humanly possible."

5061,"People over 70 years USA 15.4%, UK 18.5%, Italy 23.0%, Japan 27.0% and so on."
5062,People who had the disease - a small minority of those.
5063,"People who had the disease and were old enough at the time to have any coherent memories of it - a small minority of a small minority of a small minority, not including your's truly."
5064,"It's new, it's a great unknown."
5065,It's frightening.
5066,So it's no wonder so many feel compelled to offer their two cents worth.
5067,"I can recall my own opinion in the early days when I thought quarantine would be a matter of weeks, like it was with polio."

Variants."
5080,The new flavour of the week.
5081,Oh you don’t want to get vaccinated well here’s a new variant that might change your mind.
5082,So you don’t want to wear and mask or respect the lockdowns well here’s aa new variant that might help you change your mind.
5083,I can’t what to see what shit they’ll come up with next year!!

5091,This season has an * next to it for many NFL fans.
5092,He won't blame anyone.
5093,This is classic Cuomo.
5094,He's setting it up so that once Biden takes office he'll be able to say the vaccine rollout is going spectacular despite literally nothing changing besides the occupants of the White House.
5095,The vaccine rollout could end up being even worse and Cuomo would still say that everything was running smoothly due to Biden being in the White House.
5096,New York Post would have you believe that the vaccine turned their blood to stone
5097,I don’t agree.
5098,We have very effective vaccines now.
5099,We had no idea that we would have vaccines in less than a year.
5100,We’ve also learned how to better treat infected patients.
5101,I think things will be better in 2021 than last year.
5102,We just have a long slog to get there.
5103,Definitely agree the next month or two will be difficult times.
5104,make sure you tell your friends about how you won an internet argument today.
5105,they'll be impressed.
5106,You’re better off committing a really cool crime and just going to jail for a couple years lol
5107,Feels too good to be true!
5108,But I choose to believe Biden's vaccination and mask plan will sustain the trend.
5109,Throwing away the vaccine because he mismanaged the rollout.
5110,Not looking like it.
5111,"Some countries have been able to stop or slow the spread, while other countries haven’t but they’ve started vaccinating the population."

5127,&gt;State Epidemiologist Erica Pan said in a statement on Sunday that “a higher-than-usual number of possible allergic reactions” were reported with doses from a lot by Moderna that was administered at a community vaccination clinic.
5128,"&gt;Fewer than 10 individuals needed medical attention over a 24-hour time period, Pan said."
5129,"&gt;Over 330,000 doses from the lot had been distributed to 287 providers across the state."
5130,The shipments arrived between Jan. 5 and Jan. 12.
5131,"Believe me I want the highest level of caution possible, but this feels like a media induced panic."
5132,"If that same percentage of people who caught the virus required any kind of medical attention, we wouldn't be on this subreddit right now."
5133,"It's important to figure out what's going on there, but this isn't the Chicago Tylenol murders, it's less than a dozen people having doctors take a look at them."

5137,This is bad journalism.

5159,I think we have to be careful to generalize the USA as one homogenous COVID zone here.
5160,I think it's possible that some states are having their worst months of the pandemic in March/April due to the new variant.
5161,Take a state like Oregon with a population of 4.2 million that has done a relatively good job keeping cases down with only 134K confirmed cases so far.
5162,That's only 3% of the population.
5163,Even with a quick pace of vaccine distribution Oregon might only be at ~20% immunity (cases + vaccines) by the end of March when the B117 variant becomes dominant.
5164,If it is 56% more transmissible then you could be seeing a big wave come through these states that have had low case numbers to this point.
5165,"States with more ""earned"" immunity will have less of an issue with the new variant as they might be near 40% immunity by mid-March."

5281,"But USA is all about that cash and that marketing, so people are used to associating ""recognizable logo"" with ""quality."""
5282,"Lo and behold, they don't recognize Aldi brands and think ""ew it's bad."""
5283,"And lo and behold, give it enough time and people realize wait no, it isn't bad at all, it's just not trying to brainwash you with logos like every other American company."
5284,Come on now.
5285,"The amount of ""aid funds"" that developing countries receive is eclipsed by the amount of money they lose from interest payments, foreign investments, etc."
5286,"See this study:

That aside, India and South Africa also put forth a proposal to temporarily suspend WTO patent rules to expand vaccine access to developing countries."
5287,"I'm sure you can guess how the rich countries felt about that:

https://mobile.reuters.com/article/amp/idUSKBN280215?__twitter_impression=true

Solely framing this as an issue with greedy dictators (who no doubt exacerbated the crisis, don't get me wrong) is extremely reductive and misleading IMO."

5290,"It includes a Friday, but was also a weekend and a holiday."
5291,"But, who knows?"

5294,Yes.
5295,Tedros said what difference does it make what we call it.
5296,And what about the “p” word is so important.
5297,Do they also pay significantly better than other grocery stores?
5298,China recovering from a lock down is much easier and faster than other countries because of the government’s influence on their economy and companies
5299,Yeah what is going on lol
5300,K
5301,Why wouldn't it be?
5302,It's not like they're giving pay cuts to people who refuse it - I'm pretty sure even that would only be a problem if the employees had a contract guaranteeing their pay.
5303,I’ve been isolating for a year.
5304,The worst I did was see a grandparent.
5305,Please do not act like anyone who got Covid must be an idiot or those with my opinion are selfish.
5306,Throwing away a year of your life for something that barely effected you seems about as far from selfish as it gets.
5307,"Keep the “holy than thou” attitude up though, I’m sure it will get you far."
5308,"no i don’t have vEDS as far as my diagnosis’ go, but as α kid i’d always be the only one having to stop riding α bike or running and stop for about 20 minutes, if i don’t drink enough ive passed out before getting out of the shower, splotchy legs (purple, red, then some spots normal), my blood pressure drops very very low when i stand up, after i walk for about 10 minutes straight my heart rate is up in the 160s-170s, and i’m not sure if this if related but my legs ache and almost burn after walking, and sometimes i feel dizzy when walking."
5309,"that’s really all i can think of right now, but i’m taking α medicine to decrease my blood pressure only because another alternative medicine isn’t the best for my age and itd be too hard on my system."
5310,do you think you have pots or were you just curious?
5311,"&gt; I don't know what figures you're looking at, but our 7 day average new case rate is the same as it was in early December and has no clear trend down beyond the usual weekend dip."
5312,"https://covidtracking.com/data

That's what I'm looking at, and there is a very clear trend on cases and hospitalizations."
5313,"Deaths always lag a couple weeks, so that won't be reflected in the data for a while."
5314,"Yeah, and please tell me: how did Leopold II came to be the owner of Congo?"
5315,"Oh right, it was the combined nations of Europe that sat in Berlin and agreed on how to divide up a lot of land that wasn't theirs and was full of people to enslave and resources to extract."
5316,"Maybe I'm right about talking about ""the West"" and not apparently how King Leopold II singlehandedly managed to enslave 12 million people before being even born and then conquer and govern a whole continent."
5317,"If you take the numbers from here https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nvss/vsrr/covid19/index.htm and calc back how much extra death the % extra is, you can get a guess on the number of extra death, its a bit more than 400k  but last weeks are not represented."
5318,"To put these numbers into perspective, it is estimated that 430 kids 18 and younger died  and 18,000 were hospitalized due to the flu in the 2019-2020 flu season."
5319,Flu can cause serious long term impacts on kids as well.
5320,"Despite that, we do not lock down or close schools due to the flu."
5321,"Coronavirus does not seem more dangerous to kids than the flu is, and will likely spread even less with a highly vaccinated adult population."
5322,I see no reason why school isn’t back to normal by fall 2020 provided the vaccines all work.
5323,"As sad as this is to say, Dem governors are going to be much more willing to “re-open” under Biden than they would Trump - regardless of vaccine progress."
5324,"Think of our country as a car, the central government is the driver, but the central government gets nowhere without the cooperation of all the parts."
5325,"Now the central government can be irresponsible, which is has been in the past, not changing the oil on time, low fluids, etc but you certainly don't blame the driver if for example a Fuse fails, you take the old one out, and put a new one in."
5326,It's inevitable that their will be some failures in the mechanisms of the machine.
5327,"And it's your job to fix those mistakes, see Wuhan, the government there made mistakes, not moving fast enough with information and action, the outbreak got out of control, the local party secretary was removed by the party, but the Mayor of Wuhan has remained seated and has done everything in his power to admit to the leadership mistakes and make up for those mistakes (the Mayor is at a similar power level of the party secretary) and the local congress has decided his apologies and efforts to fix thos mistakes has been enough to justify his continuing occupation of that seat."
5328,"Anytime the local congress decides he is unfit, they can then vote to remove him from office."
5329,"TIL that 4,000 deaths a day isn't very concerning"
5330,"&gt; and things are getting worse

Why do you believe things are getting worse?"
5331,They aren't.
5332,But why would they schedule a time and not show up?
5333,Just decline if you don’t think you need the vaccine.
5334,Lemme guess the piggly wiggly on Devine street in Columbia?
5335,ALDI is the place I have felt safest shopping since March.
5336,"Our state didn't issue a mask mandate until July, a lot of stores didn't have mask policies in place either, but Aldi did."
5337,And the thing is people who shop there ACTUALLY abide by the rule.
5338,One way aisles are kinds a norm there so people already are used to following them.
5339,My Aldi is rarely crowded.
5340,I friggen love Aldi.
5341,"I'd open a window or two, but I realize it might be too cold where you live to do that."
5342,Some dumbasses like Trump said that.
5343,Did Fauci or any other actual expert say tha?
5344,unreported cases are said to be 5 to ten times the reported number.
5345,israel is in their 3rd lockdown and cases are skyrocketing.
5346,So how do I talk (convince) my wife who is a hospice RN to get the vaccine?
5347,She hasn’t said she’s not going to get it but she’s dragging her feet(I gave her the link for the appointment last week and she hasn’t made one).
5348,She told me of the eight nurses she works with only two wanted the vaccine.

5522,"From a mathematical perspective, once enough people are vaccinated that the average infected person will infect less than 1 person, the virus will head towards extinction."
5523,"Your risk of getting infected will get lower and lower across time, until it is basically zero."
5524,"If you want to play around with the math for it, your risk of catching it is directly proportional to the number of people currently infected

The change in number of people who are infected is going to be proportional to the the number of potential infection candidates (number of people who are not yet immune) multiplied by how good the virus is at infecting people in the area (the R value for your area)

For example, if your area had a R of 1.5 initially, then each generation/cycle would have 1.5x as many infected people as the previous generation."
5525,"If 56% of the people in the area are now immune, then the average infected person will now only infect (0.44*1.5) = 0.66 people."
5526,"Each generation will have 66% as many infected people as the last, which means that the number of infected people will shrink as fast as it was growing when R=1.5"

5570,Thank you.
5571,Would you say the same thing about it being recommended to pregnant woman the way the TDAP is?
5572,These people can be trespassed and the cops will come and trespass them if the store calls for it.

5579,Thankfully Moderna looks to be more effective than the Pfeizer vaccine after one shot.
5580,Disaster might be too strong a word but if I've learned anything through this pandemic it's how slowly and poorly we react to change.
5581,"I never expected it to be good, but it's still about 10x worse than I would have imagined possible."
5582,Ok
5583,most other countries are fucking shit up too.
5584,and government agencies always seem to be uniquely bad at anything that requires a good grasp of logistics so this isn't really a shock.
5585,"yeah, i would get tested."
5586,"there are things that can cause a sore throat other than virus (like post nasal drip from allergies), but even a high risk person can be asymptomatic."
5587,"if it's not coronavirus then great, but i would want to at least know."
5588,"it sounds like you are already basically quarantining, but if you got it from your mother and she's not then it would be good for her to know you have it."
5589,And this new strain is conveniently just saying inside the borders of AZ?

5593,"A few weeks ago I was at Lidl, and one of the employees stops me, and tells me I can't shop without a cart."
5594,"Mind you it's like 7:30PM, so distancing isn't an issue."
5595,"She insists I go back out and grab a cart, so I oblige."
5596,Then she goes back to stacking produce without a mask.
5597,Do you know the amount of things Christian scientists have contributed to science at all?
5598,Your comment is very ignorant of reality.
5599,I'm a Lidl guy myself
5600,"The warnings that WHO sent out in January said that ""PAHO/WHO does not recommend any screening at entry points regarding this event, nor any restrictions on travel or trade."""
5601,They literally told countries that there is no need to screen or limit travel.
5602,"https://www.paho.org/en/documents/epidemiological-alert-novel-coronavirus-ncov-16-january-2020

January 23rd, when human to human transmission was considered a real possibility they still advised against limiting travel:

https://www.who.int/director-general/speeches/detail/who-director-general-s-statement-on-the-advice-of-the-ihr-emergency-committee-on-novel-coronavirus

A day later France found first cases of Covid, in people travelling straight from Wuhan."
5603,What’s up with these people who want this to go on forever?
5604,I can’t begin to understand how their minds work.
5605,At some point we need to put our grownup panties on and acknowledge that there is no such thing as zero risk in life.
5606,"We seemed to understand this before Covid, but mass amnesia has set in."
5607,I mean.
5608,It could be that the new strain has figured out how to make kids and young people sicker than earlier strains.
5609,Not dying isn't the same thing as not getting sick at all.
5610,You think there's never been research on sterilizing immunity and vaccines?
5611,You think this is some novel concept?
5612,Sorry I'm the one actually applying science.
5613,"Honestly, anyone who thinks they will still be fully contagious after vaccination is so far off base scientifically, I don't really even know how to approach them."
5614,They're stealing our basic worker rights around sickpay!
5615,Edit: just reread and realised they are paying employees for time getting vaccines in work time ... Erm is it legal not to in America?
5616,"Also the word ""many."""
5617,"""Many people ending up back in the hospital!"""
5618,"""Many people suffering long covid symptoms!"""
5619,Really?
5620,"Because there are *actual* numbers out there of people who have recovered just fine, and they're in the millions."
5621,"Rich countries are going to end up funding vaccinations in poorer ones, but we can't do that if our economies are stopped for half a decade."
5622,"I fully agree a life here is not worth more than a life there - but if the first world has to hold its breath until everyone else is vaccinated first, there won't be much of a first world to go back to."
5623,"My industry is hanging on by the skin of its teeth *for now* - if I have to wait another 2 years, instead of happily paying to support others I'm going to need support myself."
5624,And I don't think vaccinating the elderly in poor countries is going to enable those countries to pay for me.
5625,"I find it shocking that anyone would think that someone who has only worked somewhere for one year only needs one week of rest, and then they are good to go for another year."
5626,And even more shocked that all cashiers haven't joined (the same) union demanding this to change.
5627,I imagine all cashiers going on a 2 weeks strike should get the ball rolling..
5628,"Yeah, the WHO is saying just shutting off international travel but allowing your own citizens to move about freely within the country does nothing, which it doesn't."
5629,"Shelter in place necessarily involves stopping non-essential travel, which the WHO has been in favor of as a tactic to be used when appropriate."
5630,**Why don't we vaccinate the general population or anybody who wants it first?
5631,"**

Hear me out."
5632,I was reading an article that mentioned Indonesia's approach to herd immunity and how they intend to vaccinate the younger population first and I think that completely makes sense.
5633,"If the ultimate goal is to achieve herd immunity ASAP then why waste time rolling it out in ""phases"" (besides stretching out the supply)."
5634,"Just let anyone who wants to get it, get it right away."
5635,"Also, considering the fact that the general population moves around and spreads the virus more than the elderly for sure."
5636,"Regardless of frontline/healthcare workers or elderly, if you're in a place where the virus is already raging then what difference does it make to vaccinate healthcare workers first?"
5637,"I understand that they do deserve it as they're putting themselves in risky situations every day for us but given how prevalent the virus already is, they're not much more at risk than the general population."
5638,"On the flip side, if you're in a country where the virus is under control like New Zealand or Australia then the risk is basically no difference for healthcare workers and the general population as well."
5639,"If there actually is a logical reason for every country to roll the vaccine out this way then please do let me know because from where I stand, it makes far more sense to vaccinate anyone who wants it."
5640,"The headline is overly dramatic, and is likely to worsen the very thing they pretend they are trying to help."
5641,People should be comfortable dropping restrictions once the vaccine is active - 2 weeks after the second dose.
5642,Prior to that they should carry on as before -wearing masks and social distancing.
5643,It's not hard or complicated.
5644,I get where you are coming from.
5645,"Though, it’s contraindicated in a small portion of people."
5646,That’s why it’s important for these hard headed people to get the vaccine to protect these people that can’t.
5647,"However, these are the same people probably not wearing masks :/ Thanks to those that have done their part and continue to do their part :)"
5648,You’re not being flippant or dismissive.
5649,"We’ll do what we can to manage the risk, but we won’t completely eliminate the risk of Covid."
5650,"A lot of news stories (and Reddit comments) play into the idea of two opposing sides - one loves people and hates freedom, the other loves freedom and hates people."
5651,That doesn’t ring true.
5652,It seems like most people are trying to find a balance between the two values.
5653,"We’ll give up a lot of freedom to save a lot of people from illness or death, but only a little freedom to save a small group."
5654,"People are reluctant to talk about this part, because it seems death panel-y."
5655,It creepy to say that it’s reasonable to go out for dinner when we’re down to X grandmas per week dying.
5656,But I think we should be talking about X.
5657,"Instead, we have “one life is too many” versus “it’s all fake,” neither of which gets us to a pragmatic plan."
5658,r/whoosh
5659,I’m sorry you’ve had conditions that have prevented a happy lifestyle the past year.
5660,I did the same for about 3 months where my wife and I didn’t see anyone.
5661,We didn’t get to see our parents and our children didn’t get to see their grandparents or aunts and uncles.
5662,But my wife had enough and talked me into expanding our circle because they had been ready far before we were.
5663,My comment was more of a pat on the back and not an eye roll.
5664,I sympathize with you and hope the vaccine can get you both back to a happy and healthy lifestyle.
5665,And I hope it’ll give you the reassurance that the risk is gone.
5666,Good luck!
5667,From Berlin and it’s really depending on the store
5668,"If CO isn’t going to require ID, they might as well open up vaccinations to anyone."
5669,The reality is just that most states don’t consider a low amount of deaths (1/8th-ish of now) to ruin life over.
5670,I agree with them to an extent
5671,"They call it “unminimum wage,” and the smart workers get ~~all the~~ 12% of the money the company saves from not paying the lowest employees in the list as a bonus that is to be taxed at 45% of the employees regular wages."
5672,Unless therein they receive the bonus in an even year in which the receiver of the bonus will pay an extra 20% few on the bonus as a tax deferred fee.
5673,"In an odd year the employee will pay the 20% fee as an optional security taken against the company in lieu of the 45% tax, but only instead of the issuance of 1996 war bonds that are to be paid out at the new standard living rate of 30% of $50 two years after their expiration."
5674,"Probably won’t reach 4k a day anytime soon based on hospitalization trends, but the 3k+ deaths a day happening there now is still incredibly tragic."
5675,"Once the adults have shots, you catching it is not a big deal."
5676,You’ll almost certainly be fine.
5677,Lol.
5678,Stfu you stupid jerk.
5679,You don't even know how a vaccine works
5680,The topic at hand is covid skepticism; you’re the one that went off-topic.
5681,That’s sounds more like the American way haha
5682,"Why am I not surprised to see that it's a Scot spreading these silly ""we're so victimised!"""
5683,conspiracies?
5684,"If your own view of the world is incredibly biased and obsessed with a particular issue, everything vaguely neutral will feel biased to you as a result."
5685,"Yep, but not everywhere."
5686,I did all my shopping at Aldi when I was in college 10+ years ago.
5687,“I don’t believe” isn’t a good enough source when you’re making sweeping generalizations about countries you don’t know anything about though.

5697,"*Here is the new update from* Sweden **(2021-01-19, Tuesday):**

*Following the holidays, the number updates are on Tuesday-Friday's and press-briefings on Tuesdays and Thursdays."
5698,* ***Reporting of deaths over the holidays will have additional lag so numbers are expected to rise additionally in the coming weeks!
5699,"***

*Last reported numbers at a glance 2021-01-15: Friday - 523486 (+4703) confirmed cases and 10323 (+138) deaths* 

* Numbers at a glance (previously in the post title): **533265** (+9779) confirmed cases and **10591** (+268) deaths
* 14-day incidence rate in Sweden is now 616 per 100.000."
5700,"This is considerable decrease compared to the previous weeks, even though there was a dip earlier weeks due to the lower testing over the holidays."
5701,"Last time the incidence rate was this low was on 1st of December 2020, so *overall* quite positive development for the lowering of the infection rates."
5702,"* The incidence rate is dropping throughout all age groups, as in the most infected (20-59) which previously was staying close to 600 per 100.000 weekly incidence rate for over a month, the numbers have now dropped to shortly below 400 per 100.000, a decrease by a third."
5703,"* Skåne still has a much higher incidence rates than the country's average, but they seem to be dropping as well - 1122 per 100.000 for the last 14-days compared to last week's Thursday report when it was 1272."
5704,"The decline in Stockholm is also continuing, now at incidence rate of 369 per 100.000 - far below the country's current average."
5705,"Few other highlighted regions in the briefing are Jämtland-Härjedalen which is showing a decline in the incidence rate that was stable for over a month and is now down to 509 per 100.000 (it is a small region with total 5391 confirmed cases since the start of the pandemic); Dalarna continues with the decline and is now at 459 per 100.000; 
* An interesting development is that there are so far no (or very low number) confirmed cases of the seasonal flu for 2020-2021 season."
5706,* The number of ICU patients is also continuing to decrease from their peak which according to the [Swedish ICU Register](https://www.icuregswe.org/en/data--results/covid-19-in-swedish-intensive-care/) was 12 days ago at 7/1 with 387 patients.
5707,"Overall, the numbers of patients in the ICU have been lower in autumn compared to the spring, but many more are treated in other hospital wards and the overall hospital capacity taken by COVID-19 patients in the winter wave (3000 at the peak) exceeded that of the spring one (2200 at the peak)."
5708,"However, it is also showing a definitive decline in numbers for the last two weeks!"
5709,"* 2160 are the patients in hospital care with COVID-19 (excluding ICU), large decrease by 300 patients compared to the previous week."
5710,"348 is today's ICU patients with COVID-19, also decrease compared to the 362 last press-briefing."
5711,"774 is the total ICU capacity of beds with respirator (small decrease since last week), with about 20% free capacity."
5712,"* 10591 are the total reported that died with COVID-19, increase of 268 compared to the last report in Friday."
5713,Two of the uncertain date deaths have been clarified (and this number is now down to 32) and the deaths were assigned to 27/11 and mid-December.
5714,"There are still some deaths added to weeks 51 and 52 but they are less than 10 in the new report so these weeks are likely ""mostly completed"" now."
5715,"Almost 50 deaths were added to the reports in week 53, so this week is still being changed considerably."
5716,It seems as if the lag in reporting is lowering but it is still twice more than what was the time to report 90% prior to the holidays.
5717,"* The deadliest day in the pandemic is now 28/12 with 120 deaths in a single day (and since it is in week 53, it might increase by a bit still)."
5718,17/12 is now second with 118 deaths in a single day.
5719,"The weekly deaths in December are still below the spring peak weekly numbers (when two weeks marked 664 and 658 deaths) but quite close with week 51 at 641, 52 at 626, week 53 is currently at 616 but could increase by a bit still."
5720,"* The number of newly admitted ICU patients has also dropped sharply in the previous several weeks, from the winter peak of 231 in week 53 down to 139 in week 2 (last week)."
5721,The number of newly admitted ICU patients hasn't been this low weekly value since the first half of November 2020.
5722,"* The number of total tested individuals for last week aren't published yet, but last week had -10k less confirmed cases than the week prior when the testing started increasing again after lowering over the holidays."
5723,"Week 53 had only 198k individuals tested, but over 20% positivity rate and 41k new confirmed cases."
5724,Week 1 had 207k individuals tested that resulted in 19% positivity rate and 39k new cases.
5725,Week 2 so had less than 29k confirmed cases in total.
5726,"====

**Please, remember there is lag in reporting and deaths reported on a certain day are usually mostly deaths that happened on previous days."

5742,Tell me about it.
5743,I live in a big city.
5744,I love city life except for this pandemic.
5745,We have a midnight to 5AM covid-19 curfew.
5746,But January 6 the curfew was extended from 6PM to 6AM thanks to President Trump.
5747,I work from home and my kids school from home.
5748,I have some land out in the boonies.
5749,I was thinking about buying a mobile home and plopping it down there.
5750,I figured my kids could go outside and play.
5751,Then the local county board passed an anti-masking ordinance and the covid rates soared.
5752,I am not sure I want to go there.
5753,"The news I read was April, but that was from Trump appointee."
5754,They seriously need the AZ vaccine if any hope herd immunity by this summer.
5755,Exactly.
5756,The solution to this is so fucking simple too.
5757,Start with a high age and lower the age requirement as appointments become available.
5758,This allows older higher risk people a chance to actually get an appointment.
5759,It keeps websites and phone lines operational instead of breaking due to being overloaded.
5760,You will always be able to fill the appointments because as we have seen if you lower the age enough the appointments will fill in minutes.
5761,And people are going to take the first appointment they can get and make.
5762,"&gt;Yes, I would surely be better off than the average elderly person."
5763,"But I also could spread it to them, which is why it's not only done by age."
5764,Source the vaccine prevents the spread?
5765,I though the whole point about asking people to continue to wear masks was we didn't know that it does.
5766,It seem illogical to say we don't know therefore we must assume it doesn't on one hand while on the other saying we don't know but we should assume it does on the other.
5767,That won't happen.
5768,At least 30% said they will refuse vaccination.
5769,You don't re-distribute.
5770,Think of it as a change to a book.
5771,You don't recall anything or pull anything.
5772,"You have a shipment of V2 today and when the next shipment goes out, it goes out to the same people in the same boxes."
5773,There's no re- anything.
5774,You use up all of the V1 doses and then you'll start on V2.
5775,The vaccine won't be mutating so fast that it bypasses V1 of the vaccines.

5821,Children under 12 do not have to wear masks anywhere at all and students of all older ages take them off as they sit down in class.
5822,"Thanks, I think it's probably similar to the Danish mink variant."
5823,"Keep seeing more and more verified epidemiologists on twitter keep talking about increased worry about ""Vaccine escape"" for the new varients and that that the vaccines are going to not be as effective as previously though against them."
5824,Just what my mental health needs right now.
5825,I heard that the chips activate when you chew on them!
5826,Man that headline is desperately lacking in context.
5827,A percentage change with zero timeframe tells skimmers (aka most of the world) fuckall.
5828,"That said, yeah, pandemic sucks."
5829,Let’s come up with a bingo or other game for it.
5830,My guess is the new variant will be Russian next week.
5831,Russian variant sounds scary.
5832,[deleted]
5833,No.
5834,I did not.
5835,I'm fully qualified.
5836,There won't be any new anything.
5837,They just update the formula and keep shipping.
5838,Use up what you have and you won't even notice the changeover.
5839,It's not going to be a huge deal.
5840,They can stay ahead of the virus.
5841,"Yet CDC guidelines prioritize smokers for vaccination, claiming they're more at risk."
5842,"It's sad that I can't tell whether to trust the CDC or a survey, but here we are."
5843,I was about to say this too.
5844,"I would never say that all of these people deserved to die or that it’s not tragic, but your govt completely mishandled everything and is now reaping the benefits of being an established first world country."
5845,To pretend there isn’t an inherent privilege in the fact that your govt can fuck up so bad and still get first dibs is ignorant.
5846,"From what I understand, even if vaxxed, the risk is that virus infects your breathing pathways, and produce more of itself before you produce IgA - and then spread to the others."
5847,"So yes, you would be adding your own ""germs""."
5848,"It wouldn't be as intensive and as long as with someone who is non-vaxxed, but would happen still."
5849,"We don't yet know if it works like this, but there is a high chance it does :/ The article claims that it doesn't, but the study it mentions doesn't really disprove it in any way."
5850,"Sure, I usually swallow my food though."
5851,"But if breathing food does it for you, you might want to stop doing that, until the pandemic is over at least."
5852,Last week it was only one state (Alabama).
5853,So things are looking up!
5854,Welcome to the new administration.
5855,"Trust father government, he knows what is best for his citizens."
5856,I mean it’s that *or* until a sufficiently high number of people are vaccinated.
5857,It’s either or.
5858,"Because if everyone is vaccinated, you don’t need a mask even if you might transmit."
5859,High risk populations excepted.
5860,What they ultimately don’t want *right now* is people maskless with minimal data and a minimal vaccine rate.
5861,You don't see California's major outbreak now as being related to Newson's policies?
5862,Death rates are not going to go down significantly.
5863,"Meaning, pretty much the same people that died every day before vaccines will die after vaccines."
5864,"The difference, if vaccines are effective, is that we will see less people with a covid positive test within the last 28 days die."
5865,"This is because the vast majority of people that die covid positive would still die anyway, covid or not."
5866,"See [this](https://ibb.co/5Kj7scJ) mortality chart, from 2017 to 2020."
5867,Mortality over this time of the year is pretty much in line with mortality in the 2017-2018 flu season.
5868,"You can see an overview yourself at www.euromomo.eu 

The only hope is that it will be enough to stop the constant stream of terror from the media."
5869,This is over when media stops hyping it.
5870,"They can and will hype it at will though, so I'm not sure."
5871,&gt; but a WHO spokeswoman identified it as Guinea.
5872,Guinea has a grand total of 81 covid deaths and a median age of 18 years old for the country.
5873,"Why do they need the vaccine more than the US, UK, Germany, Italy etc where deaths are piling up by the hour?"
5874,Oh you got me now.
5875,Get lost
5876,It's going to be a small change and the current vaccine will still be rolled out.
5877,It's not going to be this black or white thing.
5878,That's the fearmongering getting in your head.
5879,"They'll pump out the vaccines, then before the next batch they'll tweak it then V2 will roll out."
5880,But you're not going to know which one because they'll just update it and keep shipping it.
5881,"It won't be ""These are useless!"
5882,Throw them out!
5883,"In 2 months you'll have V2!"""
5884,That's hollywood media for you.
5885,"Yeah that’s more of what I’m reading this AM,  thank you for sharing."
5886,"I figured my pharmacy wouldn’t tell me something that could hurt the shot, but I wanted to be sure since I’ve seen some people freak out about this and say contradicting things."
5887,I feel like my worst flu minus the fever + insane arm pain.
5888,Science is fucking awesome!
5889,😎
5890,[deleted]
5891,Moderna?
5892,Well that's my point: the WHO didn't need to tweet this.
5893,Yet it did.
5894,It lent its authority to the CCP.
5895,"The were very transparent, the people arrested broke lock down laws and interfered with public health measures."
5896,Also China cracks down on fake news and anti mask conspiracy theories so they are even more truthful than the US.
5897,[removed]
5898,The reports coming out of Israel show that the vaccine gives people 10 to 30 times the antibodies as someone who got covid naturally.
5899,So if regular immunity is 8 to 12 months.
5900,Vaccine immunity should be longer.
5901,"I agree, I'm just saying it's not just fur coats / clothes."
5902," https://twitter.com/c\_drosten/status/1351222019413725192?s=20 

But its in german."
5903,"Wait, here the translation:

Just to clarify: We have no evidence of any particular mutation."
5904,"UK mutant not found, now sequencing for completeness."
5905,I don't expect any surprises there at the moment.
5906,"""ZDFHeute"" has summarized the state of information well: no reason to worry."
5907,You likely have less than a one in one thousand chance of dying and most likely you won’t even get very sick if you do get Covid.
5908,An 85 year old has more like a one in 10 change of dying.
5909,Chill out and wait your turn.
5910,You’ll be fine.
5911,"We also had data suggesting that reinfection was extremely unlikely way back last spring, but the internet and experts still spent another 6 months after that arguing about it."
5912,Another red flag I see is that we still don't even know how infectious asymptomatic people are.
5913,"I've seen conclusions ranging from ""Asymptomatic spread is extremely unlikely"" to ""Asymptomatic carriers are 75% as infectious as symptomatic carriers."""
5914,"All it takes is one asshole study that says, ""Based on mathematical models we think there's a chance that vaccinated people can spread COVID just as easily as asymptomatic people,"" and the masks stay forever."
5915,Let me know when you find a nursing home like that so I can sign up.
5916,"&gt; stops transmission

Stops completely or just reduces greatly?"
5917,They're not expecting it to be a problem.
5918,They (the CDC) said it would probably take a couple of years for it to mutate so much that the vaccine is useless.
5919,Well before then the companies making the vaccine will be able to tweak the formula (it'll only take about a month) and we're good to go for awhile.
5920,"This shit about ""it's resistant!"""
5921,is fear porn.
5922,When they say resistant all the really mean is it lowers the efficacy of existing antibodies a little bit.
5923,Not that it can completely sneak by.
5924,If WHO did it's job properly we wouldn't need vaccines right now.
5925,"Warning nations about new epidemic dangers is one of their main jobs, and they failed terribly there at the beginning of the pandemic."
5926,"That’s more of what I’m reading this morning, it was bad to take before but ok after."
5927,"Just trying to make sure I don’t screw this up, thought I could tough it out today but nope lol thank you!"
5928,"if you are quarantining every single person that comes through, how is that normal?"
5929,Oh please.
5930,There are places in the world where people regularly starve and shit themselves to death from waterborne diseases.
5931,"If we, in places where that does not happen, had to hold back on every advancement in order to wait for the entire world to catch up, we'd all be living in 3rd world conditions."
5932,Cuomo sent COVID19 positive patients into nursing homes directly causing major outbreaks in them.
5933,He did this after Italy did the same thing and loudly warned the world not to do it.
5934,He did this against the strong advice of nearly all experts.
5935,How can you possibly excuse such a reckless and devastating decision?
5936,"original text 

&gt; Эффективность вакцины складывается из ее иммунологической эффективности и профилактической эффективности."
5937,"По результатам первой-второй фаз клинических исследований, иммунологическая эффективность вакцины «ЭпиВакКорона» составляет 100%."
5938,"mtl

&gt; The effectiveness of a vaccine consists of its immunological effectiveness and preventive effectiveness."
5939,"According to the results of the first and second phases of clinical trials, the **immunological efficacy** of the EpiVacCorona vaccine is 100%."

5941,"Also may sound harsh, but due to other diseases, poverty, famine etc most of the third world has a much lower average age of their population."
5942,"As one of the largest factors of risk for Covid is age, they don’t need the vaccine as bad."
5943,"Look at Africa, ~60k deaths on a continent with over a billion people, most of those deaths in South Africa one of the better off financially countries."
5944,"1st world needs the vaccine more as we have more elderly, and that includes vaccinating our young to mitigate spread."
5945,"Lastly, the countries who are paying for the vaccine with the tax money of their citizens should be able to benefit from the fact they’re paying for it."
5946,Exactly.
5947,People assume just because you're vaccinated that they have some form of virus bug zapper that no virus ever escapes.
5948,"Sterilizing immunity is possible, but it wasn't the intent with these first run vaccines."
5949,You got a link?
5950,[removed]
5951,But that's the way the world is supposed to work.
5952,Stores shouldn't have to physically remove assholes from their property.
5953,So about as infectious as the UK variant which makes sense as it shares certain mutations.
5954,I don’t think he cares he likes the power
5955,Newson kept California under very strict lockdown rules while there was very little spread causing the current explosion in cases because people got sick of the randomly changing restrictions and are just ignoring them now.
5956,He originally championed a flatten the curve science based approach but instead has just thrown around restrictions that devastate small businesses and aren't supported by evidence to significantly reduce spread.
5957,If you want deaths low you need to very aggressively protect nursing homes.
5958,Newson's strategy did this better in the first few months but now we have tons of nursing home outbreaks.
5959,"&gt; ""It's not like you'll need to wear a mask for the rest of your life,"" he says."
5960,"""You need to wear your mask until we have the data, and we're trying to get the answers as fast as we can."""
5961,"This isn't saying, ""Wear a mask until everyone who wants a vaccine has one."""
5962,"It's saying, ""Wear a mask until we find empirical proof that vaccinated people can't asymptomatically spread the virus."""
5963,That's an absurdly high bar IMO.
5964,Americans can travel to the UK right now.
5965,You are just subject to 10 day isolation period and a PCR test requirement for entry.
5966,"They can’t even roll out a fucking stimulus or pua unemployment correctly, millions are still waiting for that shit."
5967,All true.
5968,Doesn't take away from the fact that there's absolutely nothing right now that points to 1) potential for SARS-CoV-2 to increase in lethality (the opposite is way more likely) and 2) spike proteins on SARS-CoV-2 do not really have the potential to mutate in a way that will make vaccines useless.
5969,So why constant panic from tv?
5970,This is a virus with a REALLY low lethality which is mainly dangerous only for very old and frail people.
5971,Why don't we do our best to protect those and keep carrying on with our lives?
5972,"The flu routinely sends hospitals into overdrive, we didn't stop the world before 2020."
5973,"I'm saying that because if we justify doing all we've done for covid, we can and will justify doing all this for the flu in the next years."
5974,I am not sure why people believe it's acceptable.

5982,I actually JUST finished my college biology class and the textbook explicitly stated exactly what I'm saying.
5983,Same problem with the US Senate.
5984,"Land should not have voting rights, population should."
5985,Exactly what I mean.
5986,They're accusing him of trying to do herd immunity without any evidence or reason other than he's Republican and Republican is evil.
5987,"[Meanwhile, the media praises Cuomo](https://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2020/05/21/why-governor-andrew-cuomo-praised-coronavirus-response-column/5220164002/)"
5988,"Yes, but not every state."
5989,Ahh makes sense.
5990,Thought Aldi might be a little more progressive as a company though as they are far from the worst grocery chain to work for in Europe.
5991,Still requires getting a specific appointment slot and then having a manager ok the time off and with the amount of jabs needing to be given out I can’t imagine there’s going to be loads of choice as to when you can book in.
5992,CTs can't fathom that nobody is in control of the world.
5993,It's a big messy train flying down the tracks with nobody in the control room.
5994,"Sad to hear that, will edit to make my post less misleading."
5995,"I'm sure it differs from country to country and region to region, but it makes sense that lack of resources and money, and perhaps a lack of awareness campaigns in some regions would be a huge obstacle."
5996,Plot twist: The placebo is the cure.
5997,Sugar pills cure cancer.
5998,Not sure how that invalidates the fact he was disabled?
5999,I'm not sure what good it does for them to make a statement like this.
6000,"There are a huge number of issues that are ""not right"" when it comes to world health issues."
6001,Politicizing them like this statement does is an ineffective way to address them.
6002,Of course countries are going to take care of their own citizens first.
6003,"It's like saying it's ""not right"" that I can afford medical care when my elderly neighbor can't."
6004,"Of course it's ""not right"" for people to not have access to health care, but it is reality."
6005,"Getting the vaccine individually won't change things in their lives, other than mentally and safety wise."
6006,"Society can't resume until we hit herd immunity, since you can't tell a vaccinated person from an unvaccinayed one with veracity."
6007,But they can still allow themselves some more freedoms without going back to maskless normal.
6008,Florida was also handing them out at parks and other similar venues to anyone willing to wait in long lines.
6009,We aren't really distributing vaccines in that manner.
6010,Yeah well they don't have to go on national radio and tell us otherwise.
6011,Because that's what they did and that's why I made my comment in good faith.
6012,"Agnes Wold, professor of clinical bacteriology in Sweden, clearly stated it couldn't get transmitted from foods."
6013,So therefore I've been ordering home lots of meals since the start of the pandemic.
6014,"I also got infected.. not sure from where or what, obviously, but would be a shame if this is actually a thing."
6015,Capitolism 🎉
6016,Exactly.
6017,A dispensary in Michigan is doing “pot for shots”.
6018,You get a free doob with each vaccine.
6019,"&gt; But, if you're going to do it then just lock everything down but the absolute essentials for a few weeks and get it over with."
6020,That's what march was supposed to be about.
6021,And it was such a great success we decided to keep it up for the next 10 months FML.
6022,We handled this whole thing really shit.
6023,If your are not travelling for leisure then what for?
6024,Business?
6025,We have and for a long time had solutions for that.
6026,What can you travel for that ABSOLUTELY and unquestionably requires your very being to be at a given location?
6027,I'm genuinely curious
6028,There are *so* many people who think their annual cold is flu.
6029,The first time I had real flu I knew I would never confuse the two again.
6030,Flu is totally debilitating and the worst sickness I’ve ever felt.
6031,You might want to go back to Biology class my man.
6032,I love this store so much
6033,"That ""fun fact"" is probably the most ridiculous thing I have read today..."
6034,Their population is 9million.
6035,6.3 million people can still spread the virus quickly.
6036,"If people (non-vaccinated people) are ignoring distancing rules because the vaccine has started to roll it (or other reasons), that could be a reason for the high cases."
6037,Plus the virus increases in an exponential growth curve
6038,"https://edition.cnn.com/world/live-news/coronavirus-pandemic-vaccine-updates-01-19-21/h_e46caeffa3db286cdbd1b64bc2207f4f

news to me."
6039,Anything less than 100 percent and we wear masks for an entire year according to this sub.
6040,Two months from now when you see a picture of Florida and there isn't a single person even thinking of wearing a mask this sub is going to go onto hysteria.
6041,2 of the 4 are mRNA - Pfizer and Moderna
6042,at what point to people who were in the double-blind vaccine trials get unblinded?
6043,Not all of the antibodies generated in the B cells are neutralizing... anything against the post fusion will not be for example.
6044,But yeah an antibody against S1 but not the RBD but to binds with ACE could throw things out of wack.
6045,More research please!
6046,Damn I can’t even be mad at you for flexing on us because it’s true.
6047,I mean by the logic Nigerians definitely owe the Congo for those “15 million lives” to then
6048,This is cherry picking central.
6049,I just assume they’re getting their talking points from talk radio and podcasts and come here to repeat what they just heard.
6050,It's not even something that's on people's radars here.
6051,The lack of time off compared to other countries isn't something that's seem as a major issue.
6052,They are not sentient.
6053,External situations do not alter the pace or the path of evolution in any way.
6054,"The virus will either disappear or evolve in a way that makes it so we can't eliminate it, but there's no PRESSURE on it to do so."
6055,"A vaccine is still worthwhile because it reduces the number of infections, thus limiting the opportunities for mutation."
6056,Hope you guys get a handle on it.
6057,"This variant has ripped through us in the UK over the Christmas period, many of our hosptials are in crisis mode and the NHS is on its knees its twice as bad as the first wave."
6058,"Cases are falling now thankfully but the trail of destruction is still continuing with hospitalizations and deaths

We had a record for deaths reported today at 1610 the equivalent of 7808 if we had a population the size of the US and it will go higher over the next week or two."
6059,Maybe there's a middle ground to be had here.
6060,"Like, rather than just say ""I've got my two shots, fuck everyone else I'm gonna go live life"" maybe there's a way to sort of ease back into things."
6061,"Yeah, absolutely have family dinners assuming everyone there is vaccinated--you should know, they're your family."
6062,Board game night or D&amp;D with close friends?
6063,Absolutely!
6064,But maybe still avoid super-spreader events for another little bit; especially if you are for whatever reason one of the first people to get the vaccine.
6065,Maybe still consider not going to the Irish dive bar on St. Patrick's Day.
6066,Maybe still consider remote service this Easter.
6067,"Because there will be people in those crowds, possibly *working* in those crowds, who've yet to receive the vaccine, depending on how the Biden administration salvages the botched rollout."
6068,Just put that 2 gram piece of fabric on your face for fucks sake.
6069,Yeah the hell with rebuilding after we try and move past the pandemic.
6070,What’s done is done.
6071,Pack it up.
6072,"Reducing the chance of everyone getting the virus will allow things to start opening back up towards normal, then more jobs will become available, leading to people being able to recover from the damage this has all done."
6073,What if say everyone did the job instead of whining
6074,"Read “dead aid” or look up “the aid trap”
Or confessions of an economic hitman"
6075,"&gt; In most European countries the minimum vacation time starts from about 20 days a year

That's the legal minimum in the EU."
6076,"Bank holidays on top of that, i only mention the latter for benefit of the americans."
6077,Especially since most of those with really strong lockdowns paid people some percentage of their income as an incentive/protection.
6078,4 years for breaking lock down laws and interfering with public health measures.
6079,Yes people take these things very seriously in China which is why they have so few cases.
6080,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K4SBNhYoQs
6081,THANK YOU.
6082,"You want trial participants to resemble average people as much as possible, this is not a matter of the timeline for the SARS-CoV-2 vaccine."
6083,"All things considered, it's a pretty normal trial."
6084,An environment being controlled doesn't mean people have to be sequestered.
6085,"If other people who will potentially be receiving the vaccine in the future will likely be going to work, getting their groceries, etc... we want the clinical trial participants to be doing the same things."
6086,"That is their choice, but they are risking the lives of people they are working with."
6087,"The vaccine (Moderna) has been under development since 2019, COVID is not a new virus, the COVID19 is, most of the vaccines released today are variety of previous vaccine that are adapted to the new one and gone trough pretty tough clinical trials."
6088,Unfortunately the stupidity of some people and the massive antivax lunatics are spreading such fear and miss information about the vaccine that is harming everyone.
6089,"A world where I can’t lick doorknobs, isn’t a world I want to live in"
6090,You do not even understand how encouraged I am to see this statement on this sub.
6091,"You should focus on both statistics, but if people only focus on one I'd prefer it be the latter."
6092,We still have a couple months until the majority of people are vaccinated.
6093,And nearly every state is spiking and in danger zones again.
6094,"Vaccines are on the way and hope is good, but I don't want people to ignore the very real risks of the next few weeks when the biggest dangers are largely preventable,"
6095,Well California isn’t getting any better.
6096,People must be breaking lockdown.
6097,I guess we’ll go full China and start welding doors shut.
6098,"Maybe ""jump"" is the wrong word..."
6099,"The ""west"" failed from the start."
6100,You're not making sense
6101,"More details on the vaccine here: [https://www.rospotrebnadzor.ru/region/korono\_virus/versus\_covid.php](https://www.rospotrebnadzor.ru/region/korono_virus/versus_covid.php)  


It's a peptide subunit vaccine targeting three epitopes, and hence safer than some other types of vaccine especially for immunosupressed people."
6102,"Using modern solid-phase peptide synthesis it can be easily produced at huge volume, and is stable at 2 to 8 C making it easy to transport."
6103,(So they claim)
6104,[removed]
6105,Herd immunity should kick around 650k on its own.
6106,Combined with vaccines I think America will top around 550k.
6107,Completely anecdotal but I can attest to the idea that people may come around when they hear other people getting it.
6108,My 80 year old Grandma who is eligible was completely against the idea of getting vaccinated saying she didn't want to be a guinea pig and said she would need to speak to a doctor or friends (my words weren't enough apparently) before considering doing it.
6109,I was appalled and frustrated that she would think this way considering she was alive during polio and all that.
6110,That is until my father who became eligible recently got his first shot the other weekend.
6111,"When I relayed this to her and expressed he was fine, she was shocked and said ""maybe I'll need you to help me with this""."
6112,"She was still a little unsure and wanted to wait until after my dad had his 2nd shot, but that's a lot better than the outright rejection she had before
   
It really shows that it's the stories of people around them that could convince people to get vaccinated"
6113,Of course its going to at least severely limit the spread.
6114,If you've been vaccinated if you still can contract it and transmit it there will be a much shorter time period you are infectious and a lesser virus you are transmitting.
6115,There is no possible way that isn't true.
6116,They are just saying this so when the numbers are a tenth of what they are now that we don't all abandon masks....which we probably will anyways.

6118,I mean it’s way more complicated then that you could write an entire library about why “poor” nations are poor.
6119,Don’t grossly oversimplify it
6120,"&gt; Alternatively, we may see some countries opt for requiring vaccinations in order to participate in various facets of life - school, work, travel, concerts, etc."
6121,"I would hope that we can do some of this within the U.S., as at least in terms of employment [it's legal to require vaccines for jobs](https://www.shrm.org/resourcesandtools/legal-and-compliance/employment-law/pages/coronavirus-mandatory-vaccinations.aspx) (obviously with some exceptions)."
6122,Testing is often more expensive than the vaccine.
6123,"Whoa, whoa slow down there."
6124,"This is a little much - Republicans, probably."

6168,If the vaccine is only being given out during shift times then people might have been reluctant to go and get it if their pay was going to decrease.
6169,This is to allow them to get it without worrying about that.

6186,Israel is in lockdown since the 26.12 and now the government wants to increase it for another 2 weeks till the 5.2.
6187,"But most of the daily 8K-10K new cases located at small amount of cities in which the government don’t try to enforce, cities where everyone doing mass events and gatherings,

The big cities like TLV, Haifa, beer Sheva etc gets only 5%-7% confirmed cases from all the tests
While cities like Jerusalem and Bnei brak get 20% (1 of every 86 is confirmed) 

Cities where people go with the rules are fine even with the first dose of the vaccine, while cities without enforcement getting increased numbers of new cases and no one tries to do anything about that, they doing “collective punishment” on all the citizens without going to enforce the main source of it, in this rate the lockdown will never end."
6188,"We could be out of this lockdown for weeks but the government doesn’t care, they don’t try to enforce the cities with the cases, everything there is like normal, the vaccines won’t going to help if they can’t even control the contaminated cities"

6202,Employers have fought pretty hard to keep Congress/DoL from enacting any provisions regarding required time off.
6203,Even holidays aren't guaranteed time off for your average employee.
6204,Their argument is that by mandating this it eliminates one of their ways of being competitive for employees.
6205,It's a load of horse crap.
6206,"If we mandate 20 days of vacation or 15 vacation days plus the 10 holidays, then you can either be competitive by going above and beyond that or just paying your employees more."

6213,"&gt;  A logistic model controlling for physical distancing, population demographics, and other variables found that a 10% increase in self-reported mask-wearing was associated with an increased odds of transmission control (odds ratio 3·53, 95% CI 2·03–6·43)."
6214,I'm not sure how to interpret this.
6215,"I understand the direction, mask-wearing helps increase transmission control, but the magnitude is confusing to me."
6216,"Is 3.53 a large impact, a small one?"

6227,NYS will receive a few hundred thousand doses this week.
6228,Yeah.
6229,"Japan has been at 90-95% mask compliance since March, and we're seeing record numbers now because we did nothing else to stop or even just slow it."
6230,"It's such a shame, seeing as the government here is just as wealthy as those in power in other places, but we've received one payment of \~$1000."
6231,"If they'd paid people to stay home for like 2-3 months max, and kept the borders closed, this would have been over."

6285,compliance rates in hospitals have ranged from 98% to ONE hospital at 38%.

6287,"Yeah, maybe several millions of doses by April, but we need something like 100 million doses in Germany, maybe more."
6288,So Curevac is really important!
6289,"AstraZeneca would be great because it's hopefully available and authorized by the end of January, but I hope Curevac will provide better efficacy."
6290,Doesn't sound any worse than the claims of hospital staff refusing vaccines.
6291,"I don't think anyone said 50x more, they said 50% more."

6293,"You can compensate for those risks by adding extra distancing, better ventilation, and better masks."
6294,The science of airborne vs droplet is not well understood.
6295,"One model suggest that airborne transmission only happen when artificial air currents carry a lot of virus in a fixed direction, therefore it is rare compared to droplets spread, see case study 2 and 3 in [https://english.elpais.com/spanish\_news/2020-06-17/an-analysis-of-three-covid-19-outbreaks-how-they-happened-and-how-they-can-be-avoided.html](https://english.elpais.com/spanish_news/2020-06-17/an-analysis-of-three-covid-19-outbreaks-how-they-happened-and-how-they-can-be-avoided.html) But a different model suggest that the virus concentration build up like smoke and therefore airborne transmission is quite likely [https://english.elpais.com/society/2020-10-28/a-room-a-bar-and-a-class-how-the-coronavirus-is-spread-through-the-air.html](https://english.elpais.com/society/2020-10-28/a-room-a-bar-and-a-class-how-the-coronavirus-is-spread-through-the-air.html)

I don't know which of the two models are more correct, the second one *feels* more right, but the first one is better supported by case study evidence."
6296,"I have yet to see scientifically verified cases where people got infected from over 6 feet apart in the absence of artificial air currents, so I don't know the probability of it."
6297,"Vaccines: In very rare cases, some vaccines (such has the de-activated version of the polio vaccine) have been known to prevent symptoms manifesting but the person still have some virus in their body and might infect other people."
6298,"We currently think this is possible but unlikely for Covid, see [https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19/comments/kvbz9y/weekly\_question\_thread/gj87j7y/?context=1](https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19/comments/kvbz9y/weekly_question_thread/gj87j7y/?context=1)"

6340,Most large cities do in fact have mask mandates.
6341,In Orlando I never encounter maskless people in stores.
6342,Additionally we have incredible winter weather so everyone is dining outside and having parties and gatherings outdoors instead.
6343,"Lastly we were hit pretty hard over the summer and I feel many of the ""bad actors"" or those that are most likely to be out and about during a pandemic have already been infected."

6353,That doesn’t mean it has any chance of happening.
6354,Vaccinating the young and healthy is insanity.
6355,I'm vaccinated against every disease that you can get vaccinated against but i'll pass on the covid vaccine.
6356,The risk of even going to the hospital in my age group is very low.
6357,I'll pass not because 'they will alter my DNA!!'
6358,but because i got covid already and i felt fine after 1 day.
6359,I'd rather go through that then a painful needle in my arm.
6360,Well Norway is done vaccinating the most frail anyway so it is too late to rethink the policy.
6361,At least it's easier for American's to find the vaccine than Germany.

6370,"&gt; But in the US, Aldi Nord has a different name:Trader Joe’s."
6371,This is a bit more complicated.
6372,"Unlike Aldi Sud, who entered the US market as Aldi, Trader Joe's was founded by a guy named Joe Coulombe in 1967 in California."
6373,It wasn't until 1979 that Theo Albrecht bought Trader Joe's.

6377,COVID19 is the disease caused by the SARS-CoV-2 Virus.
6378,"The SARS-CoV-2 virus is a new coronavirus, and seems to be somewhat related to SARS from 2003."
6379,"The Moderna vaccine was developed in January 2020, about a week after we had the genetic sequence of SARS-CoV-2 decoded."
6380,They were able to develop it that fast because of the high tech shit they've been working on in regards to custom cancer drugs.
6381,"Production, testing, trials, testing, production, etc.... is where all the time has gone."

6385,Is it just the prices?
6386,"There are times where generic can mean lower quality, but in a lot of cases, the generic and name brand product are literally exactly the same, and even came  out of the same factory"
6387,"You have to admit that while part of this is due to anti-scientific attitudes, part of this is also the bad press and the erosion of public trust with the health authorities, who just recently paused distributing a large batch of vaccines due to higher than expected allergic reactions."
6388,This might be specific to California and might improve quickly if the current problems are cleared up.
6389,We’ll be well on our way to herd immunity with 2 million people per day getting vaccinated.
6390,"Everything will be open but masks will still be required indoors and there may still be capacity limits, especially in restaurants and bars."
6391,Some more redder/southern states may decide to drop all their restrictions.
6392,"We’ve already had a number of politicians, healthcare leaders, and various other people from difference races, communities step forward and get vaccinated and promote it to others."
6393,How many more do we need?
6394,Can you inject the vaccine directly into your face?
6395,Would this help?
6396,Do we have the pre-print article available?
6397,seriously.
6398,"Pretty soon it's going to be Q1 2022 ""just in case!"""
6399,"I'd say they should keep hospital occupancy at a sustainable level, and if that means triaging some of them out of care, then so be it."
6400,"We still don't know the long-term health effects of covid, and that's something I think is much more concerning than deaths even, especially when looking at QALYs."
6401,"So yes, we should think about our limited vaccine supply and maybe triage certain frail people out of it."
6402,"The article does actually say that tho:

&gt; Once most people are protected and there's less virus circulating in the air — and less circulating in the community — the advice and restrictions on this may ease up a bit"

6502,This is very interesting.
6503,I say this about the other half.
6504,She has tested positive three times since New Year (so no false positive or swab mix up and all the same infection) due to routine testing working in a hospital - can't return into work until there's a negative result.
6505,Not once shown any symptoms.
6506,No fever.
6507,No new cough however very fatigued.
6508,She spent the whole weekend in bed.
6509,Sometimes has chest pains.
6510,She fits the profile of someone who would struggle with the virus as well.
6511,I was devastated when i tested positive as i thought I'm going to cause her some serious problems.
6512,She was adamant that she had it earlier last year (Jan) but tested for antibodies in June but they weren't there.
6513,In October though she was not very well for a week (worse than i ever felt) and had a cough she couldn't shake since then.
6514,Work testing never shown any infection at that point though.
6515,Considering everything that has been learnt there's still a lot they've got to find out about this virus.
6516,Hmm...

6540,Had this happen too.
6541,Snagged an appointment at a state ran site for later on.

6547,I’m kinda glad that this has been a mild Winter in my area and and there isn’t a lot of snow.
6548,Dealing with constant snowfall along with Covid probably would’ve made a lot of people’s depression worse and increased feelings of isolation.
6549,Well...chances are we don’t have a vaccine for kids under 12 until mid 2022.
6550,I wonder if the suggestion that “normal” doesn’t occur until past then is coming.
6551,15% of the US population is under 12.
6552,Kind of makes it hard to hit that 85% magic number in vaccinations.
6553,Or even 70% really.
6554,Interesting point.
6555,&gt;&gt; Continued masking to a lot of people basically means the life they knew is going through the shredder.
6556,And the people who have a problem with these potential changes don’t have the emotional intelligence to recognize why they are upset and deal with it as an adult instead of at the level of a toddler.
6557,Testing much more than 8 months ago doesn't means that everyone is tested.
6558,There are thousands of asymptomatic cases every day that go 100% unnoticed in countries that do not test  that much.
6559,"Israel, by testing much more than te rest per capita is bound to find much more asymptomatic cases that would go unnoticed in other countries and do not add up to the confirmed cases number."
6560,"Texas = R, NY = D. The ratio of Trmp supporters / right leaning people / whatever politically but anti-mitigation regulars to those who aren't in those categories keeps getting worse on this sub."
6561,"The former have strong political motivation to keep participating in threads here while most other people are patiently waiting for the vaccine while ignoring the often depressing covid related daily news that this sub is known for (since that's reality, not a whole lot of good news related to this the past 10 months besides vaccine progress)."
6562,Propaganda lol
6563,Most countries in the world have trade interest with China.
6564,"If the Chinese government had closed its border without presenting any evidence, the entire world would have condemned it as ""economic sabotage""."

6576,If you're in a western country it will be free to you so the cost doesn't matter.
6577,The cold chain is more expensive and difficult but if it's screwed up the vaccine just deactivates there is no health risk beyond the vaccine providing less protection.
6578,Not getting a vaccine is obviously provides no protection.
6579,AZ is not safer.
6580,You should take whatever approved vaccine is available.
6581,"If AZ, moderna, phizer were the only vaccines ever approved I would expect 2 years from now when vaccines are widely available most western countries would have moderna not AZ."

6595,"Also, keep in mind, this was only after other major U.S. cities had already locked down."

6613,"Sad, but the story is odd."
6614,Sounds like he became well and then got sick again.
6615,He may have had a non-CoV pneumonia/sepsis.
6616,There are no details about his 2nd positive test..   hope they're not referring to antibodies  (this would be incredibly irresponsible reporting) but even throat swabs can still remain positive for 2-3 months following recovery.
6617,"8months ago ur points would have been valid, nowadays everyone tests alot, those who test alot do it cuz they keep finding."
6618,noone does it just for the sake of it.
6619,"&gt;something is not adding up

What?"
6620,They've only had 500k cases with a population of 9million.
6621,"Even if you assume they missed half of cases, which they haven't because their testing is excellent, that is only 10% of the population."
6622,"On top of that, they have only vaccinated 27% of their population."
6623,These vaccines take over a month from first jab to provide full immunity.
6624,So the amount of fully protected people is much lower than 27% considering we are just about a month past the start date.
6625,"Best case you have 37% of the population immune, which is where you MIGHT start to see some benefits of herd immunity."
6626,But it is likely much lower than that.
6627,"&gt;“If you have a vaccine that’s 95 percent effective at reducing symptoms, there is no universe in which it wouldn’t also reduce the likelihood of transmission."
6628,"It’s just not possible,” 

Imagine a universe where a virus is most transmissible in the 2-3 days before you start showing symptoms."
6629,"With no vaccine, you get it, spread it to others unknowingly by speaking and breathing, then you get a fever and lose your sense of smell; you know exactly what it is so you isolate immediately."
6630,"With a vaccine, you never develop symptoms, so you don't isolate, so you continue spreading it."
6631,"Obviously that's an extreme example, he's probably right that it reduces transmission."
6632,But the question was whether vaccinated people *can* transmit it.
6633,"On the 2nd quote, the phrasing is a bit weird... but note the bold word:

&gt; Even if immunized people can become asymptomatically infected and shed virus to infect unvaccinated people, it's very unlikely this would result in transmission to another **vaccinated** person."
6634,"I'm pretty sure that's not a typo or a mis-speak, because if ""unvaccinated"" were what they meant to say then the sentence wouldn't make any sense."
6635,"I'm also in the Novavax trial in the UK, we were told that when we get offered a vaccine normally (like through your regular GP) we could call and be unblinded then."
6636,"I'm a long way down the prioirty list for vaccination, but I doubt I'll have to wait 2 years... if you don't mind me asking, are you in the UK?"
6637,They flooded into FL.
6638,"They aren’t smart enough to make a distinction between “out of control viral spread” and “vaccination of the most vulnerable.”

It’s just a BS excuse to not wear a mask now when it’s obviously necessary."
6639,I guess it’s out of fashion for them to say it’s because of their politics.
6640,&gt; leaders of some developing country have embezzled the aid funds that were sent to them rather than invest in medical facilities and infrastructure.
6641,Yeah!
6642,That's right!
6643,They should have done it the American way and stolen the money legally through crony capitalism!
6644,Mostly pfizer
6645,We don’t know they got the vaccine.
6646,Could just be the placebo effect in action.
6647,Are you arguing that delaying a travel ban for 3 or 4 weeks is not a significant amount of time?
6648,Banning travel from Europe on March 11th did absolutely nothing.
6649,"In fact, it probably hurt our efforts to fight the virus because it continued the false narrative that we needed to only worry about those traveling from outside the spread when community spread had already been confirmed in the US two weeks earlier."
6650,If a European travel ban was to be effective it needed to be several weeks earlier.
6651,This was obvious at the time as the situation began to degrade in Italy and other countries.
6652,"Trump held off on banning travel as to not hurt the economy or scare the market, but didn't show any such restraint against China at least in part due to his racist and xenophobic policies."
6653,It's very obvious there was a clear difference between how he approached travel bans against China vs. Europe.
6654,Anyone arguing that there wasn't is either uninformed or willfully ignorant.
6655,You linked a complete garbage paper.
6656,I'm not wasting more time with you.
6657,So youre forgoing your vaccine?
6658,Except you haven't done that.
6659,My experience has been nearly identical
6660,Like a molasses enveloping the world 1m/min.
6661,Eventually you will get stuck.
6662,"Well, in mine it’s not so much “holding a reserve” as “being incompetent at actually getting vaccines into arms.”  If they were holding a reserve for second doses, we’d have used half our existing vaccine stock, not 29%."
6663,Holding a reserve sounds better though.
6664,"No thanks, you can do all that if you want."
6665,But I’m not going to and most people in my state certainly won’t either.
6666,[removed]
6667,"Not surprising but good to know, thanks!"
6668,"That is significant, cutting transmission by more than half will make a huge difference for sure."
6669,I'd be pretty smug too tbh
6670,No they are not /s.
6671,There are numerous studies saying that kids are not contagious and no they wont infect their families... that is why all those schools have been left open all these last 6 months or so and one of the reasons that covid has reach the level of crisis that it currently is.
6672,I remember a time back in July / august when everyday there were numerous scientific studies supporting the reopening of schools and colleges.
6673,Same with me except the flu in ‘99.
6674,Most of my high school and my entire family caught it.
6675,I never did.
6676,Was never vaccinated until a year later yet I’ve never once caught it in my entire life.
6677,It's not ignorant to point point out your rampant hypocrisy.
6678,Colorado isn’t far enough ahead of most other states to warrant people coming here for vaccine tourism.
6679,We just started vaccinating 70+ and appointments are right now only readily available to those who are already in a health system like Centura or KP or have an established primary care physician.
6680,I don’t foresee your average Joe (even an elderly average Joe) being able to fly to Colorado and get a vaccine appointment for at least 6 more weeks.
6681,Is this a data point showing that the vaccine prevents transmission of the virus?
6682,"Ah, it's said jokingly, but I think this would have to be taken into account."
6683,I.e.
6684,how many people chew the capsules and render it ineffective before it can be dissolved into the membrane?
6685,...probably too many
6686,[removed]
6687,No socializing for the foreseeable future?
6688,That’s insane.
6689,I’ve stayed home and worn a mask for all my limited errands since March.
6690,"Once my husband and I are vaccinated, we’ll continue to wear masks in public until rates are significantly lower, but will 100% be seeing our other vaccinated friends without masks and indoors."
6691,It wouldn't have matter.
6692,Numbers were low in May 2020 after the world shutdown for two months but couldn't get it down to zero.
6693,Countries started opening with business as usual and the spread started again.
6694,Must be easy when they've never had to put someone in a body bag.
6695,They absolutely were.
6696,I commuted to Manhattan throughout that time and it was nerve wracking and infuriating.

6699,Nice rebuttal.
6700,You definitely make a good point /s
6701,I was unblinded and received my vaccine last Friday
6702,It's the first paragraph of the article.
6703,The WHO had a budget of $4.4B in 2019 which is less than some hospitals in the US.
6704,"&gt; The article claims that it doesn't, but the study it mentions doesn't really disprove it in any way."
6705,I read it too and walked away with the same impression.
6706,"It's far above my expertise, though."
6707,Most nursing homes are in the business of paying as little as possible to their employees.
6708,"I mean, they're probably the same people who ended up killing my aunt by taking Tylenol to beat the temperature checks last spring."
6709,I'm not surprised.
6710,People who work in healthcare and refuse vaccines need to be fired.
6711,&gt; you start sweating the minute you step outside.
6712,In UK high temperatures is not a common problem.
6713,The usual joke is we get one day of summer and the rest of the year is rain.
6714,every new variant MIGHT be resistant but its very unlikely.

6719,"Pretty much every country that has started vaccinations, prioritizes older more vulnerable people as well as medical and care workers."
6720,No one is giving it to younger adults.
6721,I wonder which vaccine they got.
6722,"""Maybe vaccine affected a little."
6723,"Have to see."""
6724,This is not the doom and gloom thing you're making it out to be.
6725,"Also, like I mentioned, even if vaccines won't be effective against the new variant, a new one can be created within months."
6726,"A question for those who are working in the trace and test teams around the world:

Who is getting infected these days in Europe?"
6727,Are they getting infected at the supermarket or other stores with masks and where presence is not longer than 15 mins or is are they mostly people that didnt follow guidelines and met for xmas/new years with family and friends with no mask for meals in closed spaces?
6728,Too bad it *isn’t* a chewable.
6729,"Making my oldest swallow a pill is almost as hard as getting them to co-operate for a vaccination (14, over 5ft, autism)."
6730,Thank you!
6731,"Good to know, thanks for sharing!"
6732,That lines up with what my pharmacy had said
6733,WHO was trash at the beginning of the pandemic and they are trash now.
6734,What has deadline been posting so much lately?
6735,Who are they?
6736,Nah.
6737,It is usually simple like “sample size too small”.
6738,Like this is just one family so n=1 therefore this is a worthless anecdote.
6739,"Pfizer phase 3 trial here - Just received a call that they'll be unblinding me within the next two days and setting me up for an appointment for the vaccine, if I was in the placebo group, within the next two weeks."

6743,New York receiving less vaccines this week is a huge reason why they need to do that.
6744,"If they weren't putting second doses aside and then used ALL of them in one week, a large number of people would not be able to receive second doses and would screw up the entire process."
6745,As you either have to push everyone back or just cancel those people.
6746,"If this helps convince more African Americans to take the vaccine, I’m all for it."
6747,You’re right.
6748,We should keep schools closed forever.
6749,The world is just too dangerous and there are too many unknowns to ever let kids out of the house.
6750,No.

6756,It's probably just a $5 starbucks gift card.
6757,"This is actually a pretty good idea, if they're really worried about it."
6758,Four hours of pay seems a bit *sparse* to me.....they should really pay **for** the vaccination AND pay the folks who get it accordingly.
6759,But of course that's on them really.

6768,Yep.
6769,"If you look at economic output and cultural development, millennials, gen x, and gen z are the ones that we need to take care of right now."
6770,"Their career development has been stifled, their performance art has been completely put on check, and their educations have been ruined."
6771,Get us vaccines as soon as possible and let's return to business.
6772,That's not going to happen.
6773,"Rather, young people will continue to get infected doing front line work and will have their health stolen from them."
6774,"Even if you don't get infected, your mental health has been stolen as well."
6775,"For instance, my wife and I quarantined for a year."
6776,"Now, we go out sometimes and wear our masks to venues because at this point we be reasonably sure we are immune...and that we will not have access to the vaccine for a long time to come."
6777,"This is risky behavior, but to be frank our mental health has been so rocked by this terrible year (and to be frank really ever since DJT took office) that it seems more deadly to continue to be cooped up inside than it does to roll the dice on the virus."
6778,I am certain I am not the only milennial who feels this way and I am sad to say that things aren't going to get better for a long time to come for many of us.
6779,"Damn man, hope you improve."
6780,I have a friend who got it and was over it in less than a week.
6781,Crazy how different reactions can be.
6782,Maybe I have a different perspective since where I am from there are really not very many restrictions.
6783,No large events.
6784,Bars are pretty severely curtailed and restaurants are at like 50% capacity with indoor open.
6785,Schools are going back to in person.
6786,Masks are mandated.
6787,I see no reason to abandon these for a while.
6788,There is no reason to treat anyone different.
6789,Most older people have been avoiding indoor dining and other social activities.
6790,I sense that they will want to start going out and seeing friends and getting meals together once they are fully vaccinated and I see no reason that they shouldn't.
6791,Lizard people.
6792,Would you please pay attention!
6793,I don’t blame you for wearing one on the subway.
6794,Lol who made you judge of whether the article is a tabloid piece or not?

6799,"Perfectly illustrates the level of intellectual dishonesty on display with some of these people, because for certain there is a ton of overlap between people who would make either comment."
6800,This is the fallout from making the virus a political talking point.
6801,People take and try to justify stances solely to “own” the other political party.
6802,It’s really a fucking shame.
6803,"Equally, someone on a ventilator for 29 days from a test who then dies would not be counted."
6804,The best measure of the impact of the pandemic is excess deaths really.
6805,We're already at a point where we are vaccinating people faster than Pfizer and Moderna are supplying new doses.
6806,All this political rhetoric can't change that fact.
6807,The only thing that can speed vaccinations at this point is if new vaccines get approved.
6808,The Senate was created as a compromise to entice the southern states to sign the constitution at the founding of the country.
6809,They had lower population than the Northern states so they feared the Tyranny of the Majority.
6810,"Unfortunately, this compromise, giving voting rights to land instead of people, creates a Tyranny of the Minority in which low population rural states can block anything the majority of the population wants to do despite being much less than 50% of the population."
6811,"you could be anemic too, not trying to diagnose at all but increase your liquids and if you increase your salt intake (i have to with pots) also drink more water, and if it still persists it wouldn’t hurt to get things checked out:^)"

6819,What ignorance?
6820,"Making a rational decision to return to normal to improve 330 million people’s quality of life, knowing that a few kids are going to die as a result isn’t ignorant."
6821,That’s a calculated decision.
6822,The alternative is much worse.
6823,"And yes, they can still spread it, which is why we can’t return to normal until all adults have had the chance to get the vaccine."
6824,"Not all will or can take it, but most will."
6825,Which will also probably help contain the spread.
6826,"Not to mention lots of people have already had covid, so are protected and unlikely spreaders."
6827,Are you suggesting we should continue to keep extraordinary precautions in place to prevent a few hundred people a year from dying?
6828,And made $10m while writing the cheque
6829,"For others who have been vaccinated, how are you deciding what things to do, or not do?"
6830,After first dose?
6831,After second dose?
6832,"Them: *Millions of people die from all sorts of things therefore COVID isn’t a big deal*

6837,"To add to what the others have said, some people are not able to be vaccinated, and so you need a large enough pool of vaccinated people so that it's statistically unlikely that the unvaccinated people are not likely to come into contact with an infected person."
6838,Flu vaccine is different from mRNA vaccine.
6839,&gt;Just tell me where to ship the ID.
6840,Oh right...
6841,Exactly!
6842,"That is another reason why ID requirements can be an obstacle for those who are homeless: they often don't have a permanent address, so recieving legal document can be very difficult."
6843,In the US it’s 80+ too.
6844,Not anywhere near the same as WW2 when young men in their 20’s and 30’s were dying
6845,In the Orlando-Kissimmee area you honestly don’t see anyone inside a building without a mask.
6846,Want a link for vaccine trials for which country?
6847,[deleted]
6848,Germany just extended its lockdown to (at least) mid-feb.

6851,"Not sure if this is the right venue for this, but what should I do if I really need to go to urgent care for a non-covid thing, and they give me a covid test before letting me in (or during the exam), and I test positive?"
6852,"I live alone, I can't drive, and it seems unethical to get on public transit or into a stranger's car if I've tested positive."
6853,It's not that there's no jobs.

6867,100%

6872,"And then February 28, March 14, March 28...."
6873,"Funny thing is that during holidays a few weeks ago Aldi had a marketing campaign all over France that was basically ""Give us a try, on blind tests a bunch of people thought our stuff was more expensive""..."
6874,"In  Europe too it's considered as for ""poor"" people."
6875,Here are some AZ numbers.
6876,"1,300 people under 20 have been hospitalized

2.7% of all AZ hospitalizations have been people under 20

0.17% (19 cases) of all AZ deaths were people under 20

0.018% of all known cases of &lt;20 year olds resulted in death"

6902,I'm not from the us either.
6903,The us has it the worst either but these problems exist in canada and the more individualistic and liberal parts of europe too.
6904,Arguably COVID was worse in northern italy than southern italy for the same reasons.
6905,"The south and sicily are far more communitarian than the north of the country is, culturally speaking."
6906,It's to cover up his own failings and shift the blame to the federal government.
6907,Its funny how no one is talking about the real issue.
6908,It's the same reason we strugled to get PPE it's our brilliant decision to outsource everything in the 80s.
6909,It's fine until you have a global crisis and are begging someone else to manufacture something they themselves need.
6910,Here in the Netherlands you get 50 surgical masks for 3 euros if you order online.

6928,They could conceivably allow all businesses to either abide by all the current restrictions *or* only employ and serve people who have been vaccinated for long enough that their antibodies are up to snuff.
6929,Trying to have different rules around social distancing depending on whether someone is vaccinated or not is likely a non-starter.
6930,"Also, it takes about a month after the vaccination before the body is actually immune."
6931,"So that's going to add another wrinkle to the public-health messaging;  ""You can come into this business if you're wearing a mask or if you were vaccinated at least a month ago."""
6932,3 out of 4 production sites of Moderna are in Switzerland but I get your point.
6933,"&gt;It’s wild how you keep getting downvoted for saying YOU will continue wearing a mask, not that you hope they stay mandatory."

6991,I agree with with you completely.
6992,Our leaders are beginning to realize this is not sustainable and none of this can continue much longer.
6993,People cannot control (for the most part) when they get vaccine so that is not actionable information.

7107," **TL**;**DR:** 

A variant of the coronavirus from Brazil also popped up in Japan in  early January."
7108,Evidence is also mounting that the Brazilian and South  African mutants can infect people who have already had COVID-19.
7109,"That  would mean that there is either no immunity to the new variants, or  that such immunity is weak."
7110,Future research will have to determine  whether that is the case.
7111,No one knows yet what the implications of the  mutations are.
7112,"Experiments are now underway at major biomedical laboratories in  South Africa, as well as at vaccine manufacturers, to determine whether  the biggest worry of all is justified: that the vaccines will be less  effective against the various new variants."

7137,Just makes it seem like a childish uncaring asshole
7138,So I am confused why they are paying.
7139,Why can’t we have companies ban employees from working until they get the vaccine?
7140,We had this happen with smallpox and measles in the 60s.
7141,Why all of sudden are we communists for forcing vaccines on people?
7142,The problem is that obesity prevention is a complete afterthought in the fight to mitigate covid long term.
7143,"I understand that in our current situation the quickest way to see this through is likely the route we're taking with vaccines and therapeutics, but this is no way to live."
7144,I would rather not be locked in my house and losing my humanity at the behest of a culture and institutions that allow people to treat themselves like garbage processors for the sake of profit.
7145,"The fact that it's completely a financial/ business move aside, what's the issue?"
7146,They are supposedly convincing hesitant Americans they should take the vaccine.

7148,Not quite.
7149,"It's also the palm oil, the HFCS and the milk as well."

7166,False.

7203,The problem is when a person has weak immunity it creates an evolutionary pressure for the virus to become more resistant to the vaccine.
7204,It's similar to when people stop taking their antibiotics after they start to feel better which can lead to more antibiotic resistant bacteria.

7261,Have you heard of the COVAX programme?
7262,"If a vaccinated person spreads the virus in just 25% of cases an unvaccinated person would, it means R0 of the virus will drop from 3.5 to 0.8."
7263,0.8 is enough to extinguish the virus after some time.
7264,So it's good to have as many people vaxxed as possible.

7290,Most of the new infections come from that Ultra-Orthodox demographic.

7292,A medical friend was on the Pfizer trial in the U.K. and they were unblinded once the vaccine was approved.

7330,"Not a perfect # but a good sample size (80,000 people over 50+ studies)."
7331,All of the information is right there on the side panel.
7332,Feel free to argue with teh drs that wrote the article if you have issues with it.
7333,Damn nobody got the r/unexpectedoffice lol
7334,it will take weeks to get immunity from vaccine
7335,"I'm sorry, but you're commenting based on partisan misinformation."
7336,Sick elders we not placed in nursing homes alongside other elders.
7337,Nursing homes that has separate staff and separate sick wards were asked to take sick elders to prevent hospitals from being overwhelmed and increasing the death rate of other illnesses/injuries alongside the high death rate for unprepared hospitalized cases of COVID before therapeutics and other treatments were determined.
7338,Vaccine phasing is also extremely important and is essential for reducing deaths as much as possible while vaccines are being produced and distributed.
7339,"These vaccines are not rotting, they can be stored for months."
7340,"And your distribution plan is roughly what is happening, rollout can be rough, but it is important to not get ahead of yourself."
7341,Imagine if they did that in LA.
7342,"&gt;the bar is that there needs to be zero 

This won't be the case after this year."
7343,You may have had a enough replies but I’ll give it a go.
7344,I could be wrong about specifics.
7345,"So you take , say, 20,000 people - preferably from an area in which the virus is actively being transmitted ( which is why they used places like Brazil at one point i think) - you randomly assign 10,000 to the vaccine/treatment and 10,000 to a placebo - which might be something harmless with similar side effects to a vaccine shot or might ( not in this case obviously) even be a pre-existing treatment ( because I think sometimes drugs have to prove themselves against one that is already licensed not just against nothing)."
7346,It’s important that the trail is *double* blinded so that the doctors don’t know who is getting the active treatment and who is not either.
7347,"You wait and monitor the results, comparing the two groups and working out if any difference is statistically significant."
7348,The randomisation and other checking up would be hoped to remove other ‘confounding’ factors that might have made a difference instead of the injection - so obviously you don’t want older people or poorer people on one side of the trail but not the other.
7349,For ethical reasons it is very difficult to be allowed to deliberately try to infect people - though I believe it’s not completely impossible under strict conditions ( and probably happened during the history of vaccine development?)
7350,- so you try to choose that they will be in an environment exposed to transmission.
7351,You then compare the results and work out how effective the vaccine/treatment is because for various reason it’s probably not 100% if only because it takes time to kick in.
7352,A second ethical concern arises if the vaccine/treatment obviously works and the illness is particularly dangerous - if that happens companies sometimes will break protocol because to continue giving a placebo would be dangerous for the participants.
7353,"Patients who have had the treatment will continue to be monitored in the long run even though it might have been released to the general public, and there will be a reporting system for practitioners to report any concerning responses as they continue to use the vaccine."
7354,I don’t know if that helps or is more confusing?
7355,I hope I have got the facts correct.
7356,"Purely out of interest , as well as a placebo effect shown in treatments - where the patient can respond positively because they *think* they have been treated with a drug, there is also a ‘nocebo’ effect in which a patient can have a negative response if they think that they have had a drug *and* that it might have negative side effects."
7357,Some things like ‘subjective’ awareness of pain are more susceptible to placebo effects than others.
7358,"The placebo effect is fascinating because it can be different in different cultures - the colour and side of a pill can make a difference, injections have a stronger effect than pills, what the doctor says will have an effect etc."
7359,Thank you.

## most covid infections will show symptoms at some point."
7365,"&gt;Only 20% -31% remained asymptomatic  
&gt;  
&gt;The [new study](https://journals.plos.org/plosmedicine/article?id=10.1371/journal.pmed.1003346), published today in PLOS Medicine, reviewed information gathered early in the pandemic to find that most coronavirus infections will show symptoms at some point during infection."

7382,Didn't the USA give the drug companies Billions of dollars to develop the vaccine?
7383,Kinda makes sense to me that if we paid for it... we get it first.

7385,How is this virus mutating so damn fast?
7386,It does take more discipline.

7391,Obviously banning flights from China didn't work (enough?).

Sadly the mouthwash/nasal irrigation has been long overlooked as a viable public health measure."
7402,At least trials for several Intranasal candidates are ongoing.
7403,Weren’t these vaccines developed by drug companies?
7404,"If so, then one can’t be shocked that profit plays a role."
7405,If it’s a limited resource then supply &amp; demand applies and those that can afford it (i.e.
7406,rich countries) will get priority.

7425,I was supposed to attend a conference there.
7426,There are conferences everywhere from the convention center to the hotels and now there are none since they were canceled or went virtual.
7427,You obvioustly arent very familiar with Israel.
7428,There are several vaccines that don't fully stop transmission of virus despite mounting an immune response.
7429,This is an intramuscular vaccine against a respiratory virus.
7430,"We have no data in sterilising immunity or iGA (mucosal) immunity and we know it infects predominantly via the nasal route 

Tests of chadox vectors intramuscular vs Intranasal already give us clues onward tranmission will be reduced with nasal inoccolutation."
7431,Which is intuitive.
7432,"Astra was the only vaccine candidate that properly tested asymptomatic via sentinel swabbing, they found a net 4% reduction in asymptomatic with SD regimen despite efficacy being much higher (reported ~50% with ld/sd regimen)."
7433,"Moderna subgroup was closer to 50% too despite higher net efficacy

Basically we're not assuming worse case or assuming this is a brand new edge case."
7434,It's likely the vaccine will reduce cases but unlikely it will prevent all transmission.
7435,Headlines like these don't help.
7436,"We already knew high AB titres were induced by vaccination compared to equivalent natural infection, what we don't know is about sterilising immunity,  igA response and this study didn't measure nor did it measure transmission."
7437,It's speculation.. We all want to hear it but giving false hope without evidence can be dangerous.
7438,Imagine if people get vaccinated then go off and start seeing their grandma's on the back of this news
7439,So if there is blood from the patient there is no risk of infection to doctor?
7440,Or if the doc hands are not clean?
7441,"My country (Hungary) got 3000 doses and they are testing and examining it in a lab 3-4 weeks ago, maybe we'll know more soon"
7442,Literally what would you expect to see from a single representative who has been in office for only 2 years with a Senate and presidency controlled by the opposing party??
7443,"Can you name one rep who has done a lot of ""action"" in that time frame and in that scenario?"
7444,"I know its hard to read a bit further down, but here is a fun part...

&gt;Results  A total of 54 relevant studies with 77 758 participants reporting household secondary transmission were identified."
7445,"Estimated household secondary attack rate was 16.6% (95% CI, 14.0%-19.3%), higher than secondary attack rates for SARS-CoV (7.5%; 95% CI, 4.8%-10.7%) and MERS-CoV (4.7%; 95% CI, 0.9%-10.7%)."
7446,"Household secondary attack rates were increased *from symptomatic index cases (18.0%; 95% CI, 14.2%-22.1%)* than from **asymptomatic index cases (0.7%; 95% CI, 0%-4.9%)**, to adult contacts (28.3%; 95% CI, 20.2%-37.1%) than to child contacts (16.8%; 95% CI, 12.3%-21.7%), to spouses (37.8%; 95% CI, 25.8%-50.5%) than to other family contacts (17.8%; 95% CI, 11.7%-24.8%), and in households with 1 contact (41.5%; 95% CI, 31.7%-51.7%) than in households with 3 or more contacts (22.8%; 95% CI, 13.6%-33.5%)."
7447,And the important information in there is highlighted for you.
7448,Youll notice that secondary attack rates in asymptomatic index cases were .7%.
7449,"If you choose to use your reading skills further, youll see that form adults to adults its 28%, but children are 17%."
7450,"&gt;To study the transmissibility of asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 index cases, eFigure 8 in the Supplement summarizes 27 studies19-21,23-26,30,32-34,44,45,47,50,52-54,56,59-61,63,64,68,69,72 reporting household secondary attack rates from symptomatic index cases and 4 studies26,43,44,52 from asymptomatic or presymptomatic index cases."
7451,"Estimated mean household secondary attack rate from symptomatic index cases (18.0%; 95% CI, 14.2%-22.1%) was significantly higher than from asymptomatic or presymptomatic index cases (0.7%; 95% CI, 0%-4.9%; P &lt; .001), although there were few studies in the latter group."
7452,"**These findings are consistent with other household studies28,70 reporting asymptomatic index cases as having limited role in household transmission."

Please actually read **THROUGH** the study (not just skim the first little bit and pick and choose what you want to see)."
7455,"Although it may be not the information available on the CDC website, but is an aggregated study of over 50 *relevent* studies with nearly 80 THOUSAND subjects."
7456,Pretty solid large scale evidence using the 50+ studies as a basis.

7466,Does anybody have a more robust view on this?

7491,No one knew anything.
7492,People were nuts about ventilators until the docs figured out venting people generally was bad.
7493,It is a novel virus and people had no idea.
7494,Plus everyone is nuts about politics so everything gets coded in politics and the latest mental fashions in race relations.
7495,"Yes, it does."
7496,Without a vaccine there is no evolutionary pressure to develop a resistance.
7497,But once you start vaccinating people that pressure exists
7498,Ethics of research is something I’m quite passionate about.
7499,"When I first started my studies, I took a graduate level ethics course (in psychology) where we’d discuss situations just like this, and often students would come to different decisions about when to stop the study and give the placebo group(s) the treatment, how much information to give participants, etc."
7500,"This is why we have ethics review boards, who review and approve research proposals, that are made up of a collection of people - and not just experts in the field either!"
7501,They make these critical decisions based on ethical principles and standards developed in response to immoral and unethical practices (particularly after WWII).
7502,See the timeline of ethics in research here: https://www.niehs.nih.gov/research/resources/bioethics/timeline/index.cfm
7503,So I should give China a pass even if they did wrong.
7504,Guess Germans should also give Hitler a pass right?
7505,That is some crazy ass reasoning there.
7506,It always feels amazing to be financially well off than being poor.
7507,No they won't.
7508,"Once the at risk individuals get vaccinated as well as frontline healthstaff it will be easier to handle larger outbreaks (less hospitalisations, less deaths)."
7509,Reported covid cases will also drop due to more people not experiencing any symptoms.
7510,"Many vaccination trackers predict that the healthiest and least at risk in society will get it in early 2022,but that doesn't mean they can't return to working in normal conditions once the vaccines are widespread."
7511,"So in a few months, lockdowns may not even be as necessary as they were before."
7512,Not sure but I think we’ll know a lot more looking back in a few weeks time.
7513,"Did he lie, or did he have info on Pfizer stock?"

7517,"For those unfamiliar with Texas geography, none of these three areas are close to each other."
7518,"Bryan-College Station, home to Texas A&amp;M, is in East Texas, about 90 miles northwest of Houston."
7519,"Abilene is way up in North Central Texas, just below the Panhandle."
7520,"And Laredo is down in South Texas, on the border with Mexico."
7521,"...

you have to get the second dose."
7522,Autistic is dancing for Tik Tok in the hospital hallways.
7523,We have better ways of lifting the mood at my hospital that doesn't involve pretending that you're in middle school doing cringey social media trends while patients are no more than 30 feet away
7524,Good on India for producing and sending vaccines to neighboring countries.
7525,[deleted]
7526,No worse than lots of other places and my students are happier.
7527,No point introducing further measures that seem to have no positive effect....we have quite enough ridiculous measures as it is.
7528,"We're reserving second dose, so 4mil vaccines is \~2mil people vaccinated."
7529,It´s up to the individual countries in EU to vaccinate their own populations and to use up all of the available vaccines.
7530,Every single country in EU could have been at 3% vaccinated population as all has received the same amount of vaccines compared to population size.
7531,Maybe ask over at r/COVID19Positive
7532,Publish the data
7533,A single nursing making a claim is the exact opposite of a democracy.
7534,When they talk to 1000 nurses across the country and collect actual numbers then we have enough information from which to make a decision.
7535,"It's not really accurate to determine exact antibody titer from these qualitative lateral flow assays, you'll need a quantitative assay for that (typically a blood draw)."
7536,"Yes, this is what I was asking about."
7537,We know for sure that the vaccine is very effective at preventing severe symptoms.
7538,"We suspect that it prevents infection and the ability to spread the disease, but it's not 100% confirmed yet."

\- Before getting the vaccine you need to talk with a doctor, which will inform you about the vaccine, check if you have any condition (like allergy) which make the vaccine not suited for you."
7702,"I believe this is standard everywhere and makes sense but shouldn't take more than 10 minutes, and even less for doctor knowing their patients 

\- As the logistic for the covid vaccine is complex, they asked *nursing home* to order the vaccine at least 5 days in advance."
7703,Again it makes sense on the paper as you don't want to unfreeze vaccine that won't be used.
7704,But it lead to the urban legend that you have 5 days to think twice about the vaccine.
7705,"\- What is true is that following the 2009 flu fiasco they wanted to avoid building *gigantic vaccine center,*  and let family doctor do the vaccine as they know their patients  (Which considering the heavy logistic doesn't work), they quickly reviewed that policy and opened vaccination centre."
7706,"However, don't ask me how they fucked up, but even though my father can get the vaccine, the vaccine center at the local hospital hasn't enough person to answer the phone and according to the news they don't have appointment before April-May."

 San Francisco and Santa Clara counties are among those where the variant  was found."
7929,"Scientists first identified L452R in Denmark early in the  pandemic, and it was subsequently found in California and other states  last year, said Dr. Charles Chiu, a virologist and professor of  laboratory medicine at UCSF."
7930,But officials are now seeing a sharp rise of the  variant in California.
7931,"In mid-December, COVID-19 researchers had  detected the variant in less than 4% of California samples they studied."
7932,"By early January, L452R was found in more than 25% of specimens  examined by researchers, Chiu said."
7933,"Chiu  said there is likely some bias in the sampling, since California does  not have a truly systemic virus surveillance program."
7934,"But the variant  appears to be more widespread now than it was before, showing up in  urban and rural counties alike."
7935,"While much remains unknown about L452R, Chiu said it  has mutations to the spike-shaped protein that the coronavirus uses to  infect cells."
7936,"Those mutations raise the possibility that the variant  could reduce the effectiveness of the coronavirus vaccines, although  more study is needed to arrive at a conclusive answer."
7937,"“The  data so far is very preliminary, but it basically does raise the  concern that there may be some impact on the vaccine,” Chiu told  reporters on a video conference call Sunday."
7938,"Experts  do not currently believe the B.1.1.7 variant, which also has changes in  the spike protein, will harm the effectiveness of vaccines."
7939,"In  California, researchers and public health officials are trying to  figure out if the L452R variant is more transmissible than other  versions of COVID-19 that have circulated in the state."
7940,"Dr.  Sara Cody, the public health officer in Santa Clara County, said that  her county — the epicenter of the Bay Area’s latest COVID-19 surge — has  been particularly aggressive about monitoring the virus."
7941,"“We  in Santa Clara County have been doing more looking and, thus, more  finding,” Cody told reporters on the conference call."
7942,"“Anytime that we  have a large outbreak, we take a subset of those specimens and send them  for sequencing.”

 

Cody confirmed that the variant was identified in the [massive outbreak at a Kaiser Permanente emergency room](https://www.sfchronicle.com/bayarea/article/43-staffers-infected-at-Kaiser-emergency-room-in-15842340.php)  in San Jose, which sickened more than 90 staff and patients people and  led to one death."
7943,"An inflatable Christmas costume, powered by an air  pump, may have helped the virus to spread."
7944,Authorities  are now working to determine whether the presence of L452R explains why  so many people were infected at the Kaiser hospital or if other  conditions account for the size of the outbreak.
7945,And teachers.... we got shot up today.
7946,88 cases doesn’t seem that much.
7947,Then again most people didn’t take covid 19 seriously at the beginning (a lot still aren’t).

7988,The stuff that was said isn’t the smoking gun Taiwan News thinks it is.
7989,Taking the spike protein of SARS and putting it in another virus is a perfectly reasonable approach to create a vaccine or facilitate research.
7990,The whole point is to take the most important and characteristic part of SARS and add it to the innards of a *much safer* virus.
7991,Then you can study some properties of SARS (e.g.
7992,"antibody neutralisation) in a normal BSL2 lab, rather than handling SARS itself."
7993,Creating a “pseudovirus” that looks like Covid on the outside is a common approach e.g.

8074,"P95 should honestly be enough, and way cheaper."
8075,You would spend over 560$ on 50 pairs (100 individual filters but respirators take 2 each) of P100 as opposed to 250$ for 50 pairs of P95.

8263,This is especially true in viruses with long incubations.

8289,"The flu vaccine is regularly only 30-50% effective against infection, although it’s usually much better at preventing severe illness."
8290,So it makes sense that it would not prevent transmission as well as a vaccine that is 95% effective at preventing infection.

8361,"**Abstract**

&gt; The pandemic sweeping the world, COVID-19, has rendered a large proportion of the workforce unable to commute to work, as to mitigate the spread of the virus."
8362,"This has resulted in both employers and employees seeking alternative work arrangements, especially in a fast-paced metropolitan like Hong Kong."
8363,"Due to the pandemic, most if not all workers experienced work from home (WFH)."
8364,Hence WFH has become a policy priority for most governments.
8365,"In doing so, the policies must be made keeping in mind the practicality for both employers and employees."
8366,"However, this current situation provides unique insight into how well working from home works, and may play a vital role in future policies that reshape the current structure of working hours, possibly allowing for more flexibility."
8367,"Using an exploratory framework and a SWOT analysis, this study investigates the continuing experience of the employer and employees face in Hong Kong."
8368,A critical insight and related recommendations have been developed for future policy decisions.

8420,"It is literally the first sentence of the article I just sent you:

&gt; US intelligence has gathered information showing that officials in Wuhan, China, kept senior officials in Beijing in the dark for weeks about the virus that resulted in the Covid-19 pandemic, according to US officials familiar with the intelligence."
8421,Did you not even read it?
8422,"It continues later:

&gt; Local governance in Wuhan includes both state officials and Chinese Communist Party officials, and US intelligence shows that even within the party, officials did not freely share information with their counterparts in Beijing, one official said."
8423,"This directly disputes your claim that, ""everything that happened was on the orders of the central authority."""

8433,"Shh the racists are coming, hide."
8434,"Sure they got it wrong on January 14th, but by January 22nd, WTO's mission to China issued a statement that there was evidence of human to human transmission."
8435,Even Dr Fauci got it wrong when he issued the statement that masks don't work.
8436,Science is always evolving as new information come to light.
8437,However I agree that the initial message on Covid-19 was chaotic and contradictory.

8464,Gotta love how the business of looking good is more important than actually *being* good.
8465,Not a doctor/Medical professional is where you should Realize it’s not up to you to be giving medical advice.
8466,That being said it depends on the trial and their protocol.
8467,I was considering signing up for the AstraZeneca trial in Utah but the study coordinator couldn’t confirm that we would be unblinded even if we dropped out!
8468,We’re considering getting pregnant in the next year and I want the vaccine before I become pregnant.
8469,They wouldn’t even unblind me for that or any other drop out reason aside from a SADE or ADE.
8470,"I conduct Covid research myself so knew the questions to ask to see if there was the possibility of getting the vaccine post EUA by the FDA in case of being randomized into the placebo group and, in this case, they couldn’t guarantee it."
8471,"And of course if you drop out at this point, they also weren’t going to unblind you."
8472,The protocol and informed consent said they would tell you at the 2 year follow up.
8473,"So all in all, it varies by clinical trial and is definitely worth investigating prior to enrolling."
8474,Did you expect anything more?
8475,I think everyone kinda expected the saints to take that game lol

8481,"If the state asks because they know people will comply, well and good."
8482,"If they have a healthy base going in due to actively keeping out foreign high carb, high sugar and high fat conglomerates for decades, good."

""The **provincial** leaders told the hospitals not to tell the truth."""
8513,A lot of people like to conflate the central and provincial government.
8514,China has layers of administrative heirarchy and likely the information wasn't accurately getting to the top.
8515,"And all of this was pretty close to chinese new year, added pressure to downplay the virus."
8516,A similar incident also happened when a State owned coal firm waited 30 hours to inform of mine collapse where the law required such matters to be reported in one hour.

8522,A sandwich was not the equivalent of $20.
8523,"The minimum wage is going to be raised to $15, so that’s not a valid concern."
8524,The issue is the massive bloat of corporate profits and the growth of high wage earners as the average has remained flat.
8525,"And the final conclusion is, if you hear that teachers, nurses, food service workers and all other sorts of workers might earn a livable wage and no longer struggle to feed their kids and your first thought is about how that’s unfair to you, you’re a fundamentally selfish person."

8712,"If we get a different enough vaccine it will have utterly squandered billions spent on the current batches of vaccines, the billions spent on getting them into people only to have it worthless if  a mutation or more than one mutation on a variant makes it too different for the vax to have any effect."
8713,After all the curveballs covid19 has thrown at humanity I don't think it is safe to rest on laurels.
8714,"Better to be proactive for once, actually track this stuff properly so areas with out brakes of more severe variants can take more action - finally enforcing mask mandates etc or putting them into place for the first time."

8733,"&gt;Governments and public health organizations around the world responded slowly and ineffectually to the Covid-19 outbreak, according to an interim report by a World Health Organization panel that laid bare a yearlong cascade of failures."
8734,"&gt;The report, an early blueprint for accountability, questions the faulty assumptions, ineffective planning and sluggish responses that helped fuel a pandemic that has killed more than 2 million people and infected more than 95 million."
8735,"&gt;”We have failed in our collective capacity to come together in solidarity to create a protective web of human security,” the Independent Panel for Pandemic Preparedness and Response wrote."
8736,"&gt;Many of the failings, such as the inability of governments to obtain protective equipment, have long been painfully clear."
8737,"But the report is stark in its assessment that, time and again, those who were responsible for protecting and leading too often failed to do either."
8738,"&gt;The panel, led by Helen Clark, the former prime minister of New Zealand, and Ellen Johnson Sirleaf, the former president of Liberia, is still conducting its investigation."
8739,"But an interim report, laying out the scope of its inquiry, made clear that the world needs to rethink its approach to outbreaks."
8740,"The panel called the pandemic alert system “slow, cumbersome and indecisive.”

&gt;Investigators said they did not understand why a World Health Organization’s committee waited until Jan. 30 to declare an international health emergency."
8741,"But even when the world health body did send up clear warning signals, the report noted, “In far too many countries, this signal was ignored.”

&gt;The report also faulted public health leaders for responding so slowly to early evidence that people without symptoms could spread the new coronavirus."
8742,"Instead, leading health agencies, including the World Health Organization, provided contradictory and sometimes misleading advice, a New York Times investigation previously found."
8743,&gt;The report was scheduled to be released Tuesday.

8752,"Ok, a bit of background here...  and forgive my simplifications."
8753,"there are actually two major types of immunity mechanisms: humoral (antibodies) and cellular (T cells)

The antibodies, are released by B cells, and its major function is to bind to the little COVID spikes so the virus cannot enter our cells to reproduce."
8754,But there is also the cellular immunity.
8755,"If the virus manages to enter the cell and start reproducing, the cell will have those spikes poking out of its membrane, at this point the T cells react by killing the cell before the virus replication happens and further stimulating  your immune system."
8756,While the variant mutations in the spikes may somehow reduce the binding ability of the antibodies I seriously doubt that it has changed sufficiently to prevent the recognition by the T cells and its ability to kill the cells before the virus overwhelms the immune system.
8757,"At worst these variant mutations would make that vaccinated people are contagious and suffer mild disease, but severe diseases, post infection morbidity (long Covid) and hospitalizations/deaths will still be dramatically decreased

Tl;dr: even if antibodies are affected by mutations you can still expect the vaccines to prevent severe disease at the same level."

8776,"Man, remember in late February/early March when the CDC advised people to *not* wear a mask unless they were already coughing and sneezing?"

8788,Meh.
8789,"Even if that is true, I'm sure there will be updated vaccines developed pretty quickly."
8790,The reality is COVID will probably be like the flu and everyone will have to be vaccinated yearly to protect against a new variant.

8838,sooo this travel ban didn't stop Americans from coming back possibly carrying one of the more serious variants just like when he blocked travel last winter it was only part of China &amp; still let US citizens &amp; resident aliens come without monitoring or even warning them to report any illness to at least catch anyone with symptoms before they could continue to expose others.

8851,"I'm no scientician but it seems like what they did is, they looked at some genome data from \~2006 and figured out what genetic markers predispose people to having vitamin D deficiency, then they checked whether those markers also predict Covid infection or severity."
8852,"They didn't actually give anyone vitamin D, or test the vitamin D level of anyone."
8853,"They just made a statistical model to try and find a pattern between the two things (based on genetic data), but their model didn't show a pattern."
8854,"The study title should be ""Our genetic predisposition to vitamin D deficiency based model did not find evidence....""  Because there is evidence in the real world."
8855,That makes sense.
8856,What an awful strawman argument.
8857,The kinds of people who are out partying in these huge numbers like these are the same kinds of people who are equally as irresponsible when it comes to other precautions.
8858,They won't take tests and will come into work the next day and may infect a coworker.
8859,They take a test but don't wait for the results and will fly on a plane.
8860,Or they _know_ they're positive but just straight up do not care or still think it's a hoax.
8861,"And then it's a ripple effect of someone who _did_ take precautions getting sick from them, or they infect someone equally as reckless and so on."
8862,That's why asymptomatic people are so dangerous right now.
8863,"If you've taken every possible realistic precaution and still got sick, or accidentally got others sick, it's unfortunate, but not much else could have been done."

8868,Bingo.
8869,"Another problem is even if all the elderly / at-risk people were already vaccinated, if we return to 2019 ways too quickly before most people got their vaccine, we probably risk the virus mutating more amongst youth to a point where the vaccines won't work as well."
8870,The vaccines need to be rolled out faster to stop distancing/restrictions.
8871,"Also, all the talk I've heard so far has been on getting the vaccines to the various centres &amp; little on the part that involves people going to get their individual jabs."
8872,"Is this going to go on a ZIP code by ZIP code basis, alphabetical by surname, first come-first serve or what?"
8873,Then there's the marketing to convince all of us (as in the general public) that it is indeed safe and in our best interest to *get the vaccine ASAP as opposed to waiting* till you feel more comfortable with getting it.
8874,&gt;Might COVID-19 vaccines sensitize humans to antibody-dependent enhanced (ADE) breakthrough infections?
8875,"This is unlikely because coronavirus diseases in humans lack the clinical, epidemiological, biological, or pathological attributes of ADE disease exemplified by dengue viruses (DENV)."
8876,"In contrast to DENV, SARS and MERS CoVs predominantly infect respiratory epithelium, not macrophages."
8877,Severe disease centers on older persons with preexisting conditions and not infants or individuals with previous coronavirus infections.
8878,"Live virus challenge of animals given SARS or MERS vaccines resulted in vaccine hypersensitivity reactions (VAH), similar to those in humans given inactivated measles or respiratory syncytial virus vaccines."
8879,Safe and effective COVID-19 vaccines must avoid VAH.

8889,"I get that worst-case scenario dooming is what a lot of people have been doing for the past year, but the more you do so in regards to the vaccine, the less incentive people have to actually get it, and not being entirely sure of one thing doesn't mean the opposite of said thing is true"

9075,Scientists had already known to look for this specific mutation (L452R).
9076,There was a study back in the summer showing that it could impact antibodies.
9077,This is not a shared mutation with either the Brazil/SA/UK strains.
9078,It’s likely some other mutation/combination makes it more transmissible.
9079,swine flu was a big deal dude
9080,I feel the exact same way.

9094,[This](https://www.wcpo.com/news/national/coronavirus/covid-19-cases-have-been-on-the-decline-in-36-states-and-territories-in-last-week-group-says) reports says that cases have been declining in 36 states for the past week.
9095,"A ""state"" is a kind of arbitrary unit of measure from a virus perspective, like California has 7x the population of Indiana."
9096,But it has been true all along that there have been a few really bad areas and most areas have been fine.
9097,All of the headlines focus on the bad areas but never the good ones so it all seems bad.
9098,And when your most populous state is the worst it seems really bad.
9099,But 2/3 of the country being in decline is good news.
9100,By definition the virus can't expand exponentially forever.
9101,At some point it will hit limits and growth will moderate.
9102,Anyone have a rough timeline estimate for how long until vaccines have been widely distributed and public gatherings become normal again?
9103,"I haven't been closely following but it seems to me that we might be back to ""normal"" around this summer?"
9104,What do you mean...we can return to normal pretty much when most 65 age plus people will get vaccinated
9105,Chicken Pox vaccine!

9164,"If the US had handled the pandemic better early on instead of thinking it would “just go away”, less people would have died."
9165,If you say so.
9166,🤣 You are the one having a big issue with the article not me.
9167,yo clutch moment there.
9168,I am pretty optimistic.
9169,Very few media reports or people are looking at any data.
9170,80-90% of hospitalizations and fatalities are concentrated in about 12-15% of the population.
9171,Estimates are that 30% of the population has already been exposed and is probably immune.
9172,All of the loose ends like how long immunity lasts and the new strains and all that seem to be completely false worries.
9173,"We have already vaccinated about 5%, once we reach 10-15% I think things will change in a hurry."
9174,I feel pretty sure that Israel is turning the corner literally like today or tomorrow or a few days from now.
9175,I think the US and UK are not far behind.
9176,Cases will continue to be reported for a long time but hospitalizations and fatalities are going to start dropping.
9177,"Swiss insist on keeping Ski areas open, superspreader locales in the first wave, drawing whomever wants to take the risk and be willing to create risk for others."
9178,Because the US is faced with two simultaneous crises one of which is the pandemic and the other is political violence.
9179,We are going to conflate the two because they are causing many of us to feel absolutely stressed to a breaking point by simply observing everything happening.
9180,That’s a little unfair to the Brits.
9181,Their surveillance platform enabled us to see the B117 variant.
9182,The knowledge that is being accumulated about the impacts of different mutations is going to make a tangible difference.

9185,So they’re saying China could have acted more forcefully?
9186,I thought people were criticizing China for their forcefulness?
9187,"&gt; China had the virus sequenced, and didn't release the data."
9188,"Zhang Yongzhen received a sample of the virus on Jan 3rd, had it sequenced on Jan 5th and [released it to the US NCBI GenBank the same day](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/MN908947.1)."
9189,It was the NCBI's slowness in reviewing the data that finally frustrated him enough to [put the sequence online](https://time.com/5882918/zhang-yongzhen-interview-china-coronavirus-genome/) on Jan 11th.
9190,&gt; Zhang insists he first uploaded the genome to the U.S. National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) on Jan. 5—an assertion corroborated by the submission date listed on the U.S government institution’s Genbank.
9191,"“When we posted the genome on Jan. 5, the United States certainly knew about this virus,” he says."
9192,"But it can take days or even weeks for the NCBI to look at a submission, and given the gravity of the situation and buoyed by the urging of colleagues, Zhang chose to expedite its release to the public, by publishing it online."
9193,"Regardless of any attempt by the Chinese government to control the data, the US could have provided the world with access to the genome a week earlier and they chose not to."
9194,*The report also finds fault with other countries for being too slow to respond when there was evidence of COVID-19 cases in a number of countries by the end of January last year.

9361,I've found recently that nuance seems to be dead for most people.
9362,Everyone thinks in black and white terms these days.
9363,Why do I have to take a vaccine if my body can fight the virus
9364,"Wow so it doesn’t matter how much you have learned or know, if you fail “that” test you fail."
9365,Lol and you are assuming I only earn 3000 USD.
9366,That's really funny.
9367,Maybe you should be my accountant.
9368,🤣🤣🤣 You sure are simple minded.
9369,"I hate people so much, man."
9370,At this point I don’t even care if idiots don’t wear masks.
9371,"We’ve fought with them for months and months, obviously it’s not going to change."
9372,But WHY can’t they just go shop somewhere else?
9373,Do they get their rocks off by harassing people?
9374,"She kept saying all she wants to do is shop— well then go shop somewhere else, lady!"
9375,Holy cow.
9376,"For sure, I think as it becomes available and people know people who've had it without crazy side effects demand will outweigh the supply of the vaccine."
9377,Seems safe enough to me already but I can understand why people want to wait.
9378,In NY they claim anyone over 65 can get it but there are literally no appts available and many who managed to get an appt had it cancelled due to low supply.
9379,Its going to be 2022 before we make any progress here.
9380,This is in my state.
9381,These people are out of their minds and total idiots besides that.
9382,"Nothing they were claiming is true - right to shop, please lol."

9398,Polio.
9399,The inactive form doesn't prevent infections from spreading if a vaccinated person gets polio (though the vaccinated person is fine).
9400,This version is used in countries that have erradicated polio.
9401,"In some cases, the live attenuated polio vaccine can mutate during the time the body is developing immunities, and this ""Vaccine Derived Poliovirus"" can spread in unvaccinated areas."
9402,Those who have been vaccinated are protected against it.
9403,The live version is used in countries where there are active infections or when there isnt trained medical support to give the inactive vaccine.

9406,This is true.
9407,You could see all of these locations on the NYS website tool but if you called or inquired they would have no idea why they were on those lists.
9408,Fully agree.
9409,"I just wish it were possible for people to hold multiple thoughts in their head simultaneously: that the mutations are not worth panicking over yet for the average person, AND that this is *not* a permission structure to pretend the pandemic is over yet."
9410,We shouldn't need to lie to people just because we're afraid they'll stop complying with public health measures.
9411,"Actually, for a lot of people (roughly 10%) it really does turn into something of a permanent condition."
9412,I wasn’t trying to downplay the seriousness of covid but rather to say that I felt the headline wasn’t accurate.
9413,It can turn into CFS and for me the effects lasted well over 8 months and counting.

9420,Random factoid: One of the reasons the 1918 flu was so devastating is that it killed a lot of people in the 20-40 age group as well as the very old (decaying immune system) and very young (cytokine storm - I think).

9444,Germ Theory (ie: diseases can be caused by bacteria and so on) was only discovered in 1880 and the first antibiotic wasn't discovered till 1908.
9445,We didn't even have verifiable proof of viruses till the 1930s (though we suspected they existed prior to that).
9446,This was all cutting edge science stuff that probably hadn't even spread out to most of the population when Spanish Flu hit.

9454,It felt good.
9455,I see anywhere between 10-20 covid patients a night some of them are multiple times during my shift.

9457,I screen every patient that comes through the emergency room.

9477,Thanks for throwing your Grandparents under the scientific bus South Dakota!
9478,For some of the trials the placebo is another vaccine that can give similar experience in the days following.
9479,I was pretty worried about my sisters but I think they’re turning out fine.
9480,"They’re 4 and 2, so the younger isn’t even in school yet but the older one was in preschool when covid started and has been doing it online."
9481,"But my stepmom is high risk so they’ve been pretty locked down, and are going to be until she’s fully vaccinated."
9482,"I was worried about the impact on her socialization, but I don’t think there’s been much of any."
9483,She has zoom play dates with her friends and we have zoom parties with family and FaceTime each other a lot to get some socialization.
9484,"Obviously they’re really young, so I’m hoping that when she can go back to school it’ll be like nothing ever happened"
9485,Actually the uk variant is worse.

9492,I'm confident it will prevent the spread.
9493,I know there was some bad vaccines with polio and some people actually spread polio to their parents after getting vaccinated but they've since corrected those types of issues.
9494,"So ignoring a fuck up like that, I can't think of any vaccines that once you get them, you can spread it."
9495,Look at measles.

9516,"The claim of primary interest is whether having particularly low vitamin D, ie deficiency, results in increased severity."
9517,"Their results actually do support this claim, albeit only at a 0.16 significance level when using their chosen method of analysis."
9518,Did they choose the right method?
9519,&gt;We also used four other robust MR methods and **we still did not find any evidence** to suggest that vitamin D deficiency causally affects SARS-CoV-2 risk or COVID-19  severity  (figure2).
9520,Seems like they weren't sure themselves.
9521,Please note that the confidence intervals for weighted median and weighted mode methods in figure 2 are indeed **one entire pixel** shy of 95% confidence.
9522,"So yeah, they are completely justified in declaring that they found zero evidence."
9523,"/s

There is a special place in bad statistics hell for biased scientists who just equate 93% confidence with ""no evidence"", especially when they also **inappropriately use 2-sided confidence intervals**!"
9524,"Correcting for this, the weighted median method actually achieved the completely arbitrary 95% cut-off for statistical significance."
9525,I'll send an email but I expect to be ignored (again).
9526,"In any case, given that they are only purporting to be able to use genetics to explain a small fraction of the variance was it even likely for them to get a significant result in the first place?"
9527,Should we add the 2.518% and the 2.108%?
9528,I'm not immediately sure how to translate this into a question about coin tosses.
9529,This paper cites [one other paper](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1871402120301156) as also failing to find evidence.
9530,However they didn't actually correct for seasonality!
9531,"Instead of regressing measured vitamin D by the month of measurement to create seasonally adjusted vitamin D, they regressed confirmed infection by the month vitamin D was measured in."
9532,It is not surprising then that they did not find statistically significant evidence given how much vitamin D varies with the season.
9533,I emailed them but have not yet received a response.

9676,Thanks sir.
9677,Here in Peru we are expecting to apply the Sinopharm vaccine by the end of this month
9678,Why the doubts?
9679,India just donated 2 million doses to Bangladesh.
9680,This is mostly for low income neighbours like Afghanistan.
9681,I'm glad that your singular personal experience is representative of all 96 million COVID patients.
9682,That's good to hear.
9683,I would suggest not taking a dystopian view of what change could mean.
9684,Not to mention the mask debacle.
9685,i'm still reeling from that shit.
9686,So is there such a thing as a good cop?
9687,If so you think they react being lumped into the worst of the worst of police.
9688,"Okay I will replace African American with Hollywood talent, because some are bad they must all be."
9689,Better comparison for you to understand
9690,That’s how I feel about fat fucks around me

9701,[removed]
9702,"You laugh but in my country, after the largest flu shot campaign in our history, we have people thinking the lack of flu cases in our hospital is a government conspiracy."
9703,Not to mention shutting down half of society for another respiratory illness that spreads similarly.
9704,"That number still increased from 2 to 17 and in some places where the virus is more prevalent right now, 33/100,000."
9705,I never said children were the most vulnerable.
9706,I said everyone should get vaccinated so that we can provide near herd immunity to them.
9707,"However, your argument I assume is in deaths and while yes, children are not dying in droves like older citizens."
9708,It still remains to be seen what long-term effects the children may have from a **novel SARS coronavirus**.
9709,But thanks for your “feedback.”
9710,"This is probably crazy, but I swear politicians don’t care enough cause they enjoy the power high of imposing restrictions."
9711,"I thought this was a democracy, when does the public get to have a say in how were going to live our lives?"
9712,Why would vaccinations roll out slower under Trump?

9723,"Isn't there supposed to be a plot twist where he was in the control group, and another twist where there was a mix-up in the lab so he got the vaccine instead of the placebo, then we find out that the mix-up was because he had a long-lost twin who went to the same clinic, and now the reunited brothers are learning fun facts like they both like peanut butter &amp; pickle sandwiches, and both married Puerto Rican dental anesthesiologists named Linda?"

9726,"Given that police are an institution that can control who becomes a police officer, and when demonstrably bad individuals within their ranks can be removed, while a racial group doesn't have a hiring or firing process, your comparison is stupid."
9727,"""Known cases"" are at 8% of population."
9728,"It would be highly surprising if US detected 50% of all cases, more likely 25% or below, so the total number of infected is likely above 20% of population and could well be above 30%... And that's not counting vaccinations..."
9729,I haven’t been vaccinated yet.
9730,Back of the line for me.
9731,"Idk about everyone else, but when I’m vaccinated I’m gonna stop caring about most of this shit."
9732,If a store requires a mask I’ll still wear one but that’s it.
9733,"My parents have been really on top of the lockdown stuff, we haven’t been out except to go to the doctors office once, that’s it."

9738,SLAMS
9739,Because rich countries overstocked the tests and now the vaccines.
9740,I hope your right.
9741,I’ve had enough of this
9742,I’m shocked that nobody has called for Tedros to step down.
9743,The World health organizations handling of this pandemic has been awful.
9744,"according to this there are over 25,000 mutations documented so far."
9745,"https://users.math.msu.edu/users/weig/SARS-CoV-2_Mutation_Tracker.html


Don't Panic!"
9746,Most mutations do not change anything of importance no increase or decrease in severity of illness!
9747,"They are still useful to track the spread and specific super spreader events

probably most important is survailance to keep an eye out for variants that cause more problems - more infectious or changes that reduce effectiveness of vaccines."
9748,when a more dangerous variant is spotted are would know to create or properly enforce masking and other measures if needed to stop spread.
9749,I would expect authorities would want to send more vaccine to those areas when possible.
9750,"Haha, are you me??"
9751,People keep acting like this is the first vaccine ever made.
9752,It would be insane if you COULD spread covid after vaccination
9753,"As one of the probably not too many people who has done a couple round trips to Europe during the pandemic, I have felt pretty comfortable on international flights, they generally require a negative test and they're pretty empty."
9754,But domestic flights are a fucking abomination.
9755,"Planes with every single seat full, no test required, not so much as asking if you feel sick."
9756,On my last flight I sat next to a guy who definitely seemed sick and heard multiple people trying and failing to stop themselves from coughing.
9757,Easy for airlines to say that the flights are safe when you have no way of knowing who is infecting everyone on the plane.
9758,It's a joke.
9759,WHO has no accountability after initially trying to hide covid at the start.
9760,They can pound sand
9761,How to make vaccines equitable: make sure mass vaccination sites are set up in places where target demographics have easy access.
9762,Do not throw out doses because people who aren't in the current priority group are not present.
9763,Do not put people through the wringer vetting whether or not they deserve priority.
9764,Don’t know why they would be exporting when they only have enough doses for 2% of their own population.
9765,"Seems best to vaccinate all of your own first responders, healthcare workers, and elderly before shipping any out of the country."
9766,"I have no idea how you do what you do, but thank you for doing it."
9767,Tedros should be fired and replaced with someone competent.
9768,"From the article
&gt;Pakistan will not be given the vaccines since they did not ask for it from the Indian government"
9769,"If China wants to keep being an asshole and deny a Wuhan investigation, then I’m going to say they made this damn thing intentionally."
9770,They clearly are hiding something so if they don’t want people to make assumptions they need to confess.
9771,Are you a CCP bot or something?
9772,Because you are not addressing anything I have said.
9773,Who has the authority to lock the CDC out of Wuhan?
9774,Which local politician has sway with the WHO?
9775,The answer is none.
9776,That requires a central authority.
9777,"Easier when doing so wont result in your ""disappearance"" because you dont live in a totalitarian state."
9778,Why do the Texanians do not use the Army for more ICU?
9779,You paid for it already and the Army is well equipped.
9780,Am I missing something?
9781,"I’m pretty sure it’s been proven that the virus is airborn and can basically survive long enough in the air so that if you went into a restaurant 2 or 3 hours after the last person who had the virus was in the room, you likely would catch it."
9782,It still does on this board.
9783,I don't know why people keep talking about sterilizing immunity.
9784,Sterilizing immunity is a very high bar.
9785,"It means that the virus doesn't replicate in your body at all, not even just a little in your nose."
9786,"You can have non-sterilizing immunity that essentially prevents transmission, for example, the virus replicates for 2 days and then is wiped out, so you basically never leave the incubation period."
9787,"Or maybe the virus replicates for 5 days but the viral load in your nose is 100x lower than in an unvaccinated case, so you're 100x less infectious."
9788,"The scientists can't say that transmission is prevented, but it is greatly suppressed."
9789,Yes see this is all you needed to say to not have everyone jump down your throat and downvote you.
9790,"People read your original comment and thought it meant ""no parties or theatres or events to go to""."
9791,Usually
9792,[deleted]
9793,"I think the reason you're seeing that kind of thought process is that, over the past six to nine months, early skepticism about the severity of the virus was looked back as stupidity or even maliciousness."
9794,"So far, it hasn't been very common for people to fall under heavy social scrutiny for assuming that the virus was worse than it actually is, but the reverse has been outstandingly common."
9795,"When the first Italian study on the matter indicated that about half of people who got the virus didn't even display symptoms, a lot of people were saying they simply hadn't developed symptoms yet."
9796,They were wrong.
9797,"I'm sure there are a lot more examples, some of which would be a lot more controversial, but the social climate right now is strongly leaning towards pessimism."
9798,Sadly that results in misinformation and unwarranted anxiety.
9799,It's frustrating even if I understand why it's happening.
9800,"People don't like to be wrong, unless they get to say ""I hope I'm wrong."""
9801,That results in pessimism being seen as intelligence.
9802,"It's not exclusive to this virus, and it saddens me that it seems like it's only going to become more common with the way we simply don't let past statements, even when made in the context of the time the statement was made in, escape an individual for the rest of their lives."
9803,"Maybe with everyone growing up on the internet, everyone will have said so many stupid things that we'll begin to accept we're all a little human and we all make mistakes."
9804,"It'd be nice, even if I don't expect it, and hey to make fun of myself- I hope I'm wrong."
9805,Thank you
9806,"This is probably a good question for r/medicine, or a similar subreddit."

9820,&gt; One in which a regional politician would be terrified to not inform a central power of what is going on.
9821,"Every level of the CPC performs regular, random audits and inspections on offices lower than them for exactly this reason -- regional officers keep things under the wraps and concealed all the time."
9822,It is a known issue there.
9823,All you're doing is demonstrating that you don't have the slightest idea about how the CPC works and you're just regurgitating nonsense you've read elsewhere.
9824,Educate yourself; it is a far better use of your time instead of blindly spreading misinformation online.

9830,"Never had a problem, it’s our private property, no different than if somebody won’t leave your house."
9831,"Well, the data would suggest that your government is incorrect."
9832,"But hey, I'm not in a great position to pass any judgments about another country's handling of this pandemic."
9833,"My country's current government believes it's a massive hoax, either to stymie the economy as the most rational reason, or to forcibly implant microchips/nanobots into the population for monitoring and/or mind control."
9834,Americans aren't the most intelligent -- there's about 74 million of us that are reeeeally pulling down the average.
9835,Preventative medicine is interesting and so is making history.

9837,"I don't know what the fuck your reading, but everthing I've read so far is basically calling a spade a spade and the spades here are Cuomo  and DeBlasio."
9838,There were a cpl that are blaming Trump and the federal government and rightfully so as they are all our elected officials and they should all be held to the same standards.
9839,The federal government was supposed to lead the way but in the administrations defense the states were told they will be responsible for their own individual roll out and distribution.
9840,"Some states are failing miserably, NY being one of them."
9841,"Vitamin D is necessary regardless of this specific research, and most people (especially in the winter) are deficient."
9842,You should be taking it anyway.
9843,Make sure to take it with something fatty since vitamin D is one of four fat soluble vitamins.
9844,You should also try to take a vitamin D+K supplement because vitamin K helps ensure you don't absorb too much vitamin D.
9845,Hope it stays that way!!
9846,!
9847,FDA was saying that with the massive surge infecting so many and so many vaccinations happening we should see things slow down around end of February just based on the lack of easy paths for spread.
9848,It will if we keep doing this for much longer
9849,"Only if they agree to standard traveller rules like mandatory 2 week quarantine, negative tests."
9850,Not just risk to local population but also to each other!
9851,"Many of them are already exposed or suffering from covid, eg French president."
9852,What I've read is that there are different antibodies in your nose than the ones in your blood that may or may not be created by the vaccine and the presence of these dictates whether or not you will exhale the virus and spread it to others.
9853,"&gt;It’s been 2 months and I still can’t smell

Took me around 6-7 months to get my sense of taste &amp; smell back in order."
9854,It'll come back.
9855,Just entirely different experiences for everyone.
9856,A friend got his mostly back in a few weeks.

9861,the poorest countries have “low” number bc theyre not testing or even tracking deaths at scale... not bc they’re actually doing better
9862,Viruses can mutate at different rates so depending on the virus you may be able to get new strains faster.
9863,It helps that the virus was so successful at infecting people and animals so it can increase the mutations.
9864,"Minuscule number of people vaccinated there so far, but Covid might be resistant to it."
9865,Seriously?
9866,Just wait until the MLK Jr.'s Day numbers come in!
9867,[deleted]
9868,Umm not quite.
9869,The vaccine response is far more robust without any of the memory cell fuckery that we know covid does that can hamper a future antibody response years down the road.
9870,Is this how zombies come at us?
9871,"Paywall, fuck off with that shit!"
9872,I recall him before that.
9873,He was an opening act for Nitty Gritty Dirt Band.
9874,He drove an old vw bus.
9875,"I thought he was really old then, but I was a very little girl."
9876,That makes sense.
9877,I'm glad that the people who work on the ethics of science have spent more time thinking about this than I have.
9878,"The point is, there’s plenty of people who would be downvoted to hell for suggesting similar “what could they have done” arguments if there was different letter besides their name."
9879,"I know what that’s like, though my inflammation is caused by a different virus."
9880,That’s definitely not fun.
9881,It’s terrible to be woken up by aching and in pain just to move.
9882,"My doctor recommended some supplements that help to reduce inflammation as well, which help a little bit in addition to pharmaceutical anti-inflammatories."
9883,But inflammation still sucks.
9884,"Again, I really hope they get this sorted out for you and you start waking up feeling good and not in pain."
9885,I'm very aware.
9886,I'm also aware it is a totalitarian state.
9887,One in which a regional politician would be terrified to not inform the central power of what is going on.
9888,I'm also not so foolish as to believe some local official is going to have sway with the WHO.
9889,"It was the top brass at the CCP who had the WHO peddle the ""no human transmission"" nonsnese."
9890,It was also the top brass which locked out the CDC and refused to allow investigations in Wuhan.
9891,Please do not try to pretend a local Governor has that power.
9892,That comes from the top.
9893,[removed]
9894,"If you look to the Spanish flu, it brought about socialized healthcare."
9895,Maybe this will bring about personalized healthcare.
9896,We will probably track our health more closely with our devices.
9897,We may choose to respect others by taking preventative measures when we are sick or had been at a higher risk area.
9898,Already you can see pharma companies creating preventative medicine and day-after-exposure products.
9899,"The virus is likely to become endemic, and we are already innovating towards living better with it."
9900,Then why did he and Deblasio downplay the virus for weeks at the start?
9901,"There was an opportunity for an Early March lockdown that would have avoided the worst of this, but he passed up on it to make a quick buck."
9902,"I agree with the rest of your statement, it seems he prefers to make large vague gestures that make him look nice instead of sound policy to help folks"

9908,"In a word,  yes."

9915,Not enough beds.
9916,Put them in tents outside?
9917,"Who takes care of them, in what kind of special tent for frail nursing home patients?"
9918,The medical cruiser off the coast wasn’t set up for this population either.
9919,There was a menu of bad choices he was given and he chose one.
9920,I really don’t see what other options he had.
9921,"Now, if you go back a bit further- him and deblasio are both on the hook for downplaying what was inevitable."
9922,He should never have been in charge.
9923,&gt;My employer absolved all responsibility if anyone got sick.
9924,"“If you get sick it’s because you were wearing your PPE incorrectly,” said management."
9925,Same management team couldn’t last through a 45 minute meeting without griping about the masks.

9928,Funny.
9929,I get the flu vaccine every year and I've never gotten the flu.
9930,He’s not really to blame for nyc getting hit hard.
9931,It’s the type of city that was never going to do well with this kind of virus.
9932,But he is to blame for the nursing home fiasco and the vaccine rollout.
9933,And of course his whole book thing about him doing a great job is just gross.

9935,"Agreed, that is another reason for me."
9936,A life without the commute every day would be nicer for me.
9937,"That said as we can see, there are a lot of people super invested in the idea of coming into the office and hate the idea of WFH or more consistent acceptance of WFH after the pandemic."

9946,"How do you say ""chin diaper"" in  Japanese?"
9947,La is throwing away thousands a day?
9948,MA was hitting 5k confirmed cases a day in a state with only 7M people.
9949,It's starting to come up saturating the vulnerable population.
9950,"All the people that couldn't stay home have been exposed, then the people with covid fatigue, then the people with limited exposure etc."
9951,"Those why have been religious about precautions are staying protected but you'll reach a saturation point with the folks who are out &amp; about, just getting unlucky."
9952,It’s also genuinely more difficult to not get coronavirus in a functioning NYC than other places in the US
9953,"From the article:

“Extraordinary times calls for extraordinary efforts so I ask you to begin to actively manage your supply on a week to week basis, and do not let any vaccines sit on shelves,” Polis wrote in the letter, adding providers should only retain enough second doses for the week of Jan. 18-25."
9954,"The state said it was immediately freeing up 20,605 doses of the Pfizer vaccine and 19,120 doses of the Moderna vaccine for a total of 39,726 doses; the state would backfill additional second doses as needed in the coming weeks when more doses are expected to arrive, Polis wrote."
9955,News of the new guidance for hospitals and other vaccine providers come only three days after Polis said he was “shocked we were lied to” [after learning there was no stockpile reserve of vaccines](https://www.thedenverchannel.com/news/politics/polis-shocked-we-were-lied-to-amid-report-federal-vaccine-reserve-does-not-exist) that the Health and Human Services secretary promised earlier last week would soon be released.
9956,"The expected shipment of around 230,000 doses would have likely allowed about half of people age 70 and up to receive their first shot by the end of this week, Polis said during a news conference Friday."
9957,This ridiculous notion of a ‘bubble’ is why the USA is so riddled with this virus.
9958,You are either isolating and practicing social distancing or you aren’t.
9959,Assuming cold weather keeping more people home has a role in this
9960,"Wait until the heart and lung disease numbers kick in from ""mild"" cases."

9974,"And we still have manufacturing, shipping and banking."
9975,Those 3 bring the most money to the city.

9977,Lmao your entire next paragraph is pretending to suggest how things you know nothing about *actually* work.
9978,Colorado
9979,Damn i was wrong.
9980,Thank you for the correct information.
9981,"I am sorry, but tough shit."
9982,The nations that used tax payer money to fund the development of most of these vaccines are not going to be shipping them overseas until their populations are vaccinated.
9983,"They can call it a ""moral failure"" all they want, but nations that require aid and charity are going to be the last places to get a vaccine."
9984,Man and I quit smoking.. time to start again?
9985,Lol
9986,Definitely bad luck.
9987,I was devastated.
9988,"It felt like a whirlwind nightmare catching covid, watching others party and socialise without catching a thing."
9989,Surge capacity is already maxed out.
9990,"The issue isn't so much ""beds"" (you can always create more) but a lack of trained staff to care for the patients in them."
9991,"Fortunately, things seem to have plateaued over the past week, but it's still too early to tell if we've really turned the corner."
9992,The medical field isn’t a government service in the US.
9993,People have been voting against socialized healthcare for decades.
9994,And there isn’t enough medical military staff to cover the all the missing gaps either.
9995,I was always a fan of the cone more than the ice cream anyway
9996,"I like how some people want to argue about the vaccine being “so rushed” as if they were really going to endure 3+ years of wearing masks, social distancing, no mass gatherings, and constant lockdowns until they felt like enough time has passed for a vaccine to be properly developed 🤣."
9997,I like to see their solution of how they would end this pandemic any quicker 🧐
9998,"I'm thinking they should be mandated for now but not forever, and would have preferred consistent and unified messaging to convince enough of the public to do it by choice a long time ago instead of forcing them preferable."
9999,The rampant spread of the virus and the mutations each generation of the virus has potential of acquiring threatens the success of the vaccine putting an end of this in our immediate future.
10000,We need people to just... try... to not spread it for a few months.
10001,"There's so many people who just never even tried, nevermind the people who tried but are getting sick of it."
10002,I have no idea.
10003,But mind that in Germany prejudices against foreigners and skin colour is also high but people talk much less about it.
10004,"Like the corruption which is high as well but people like to pretend it is not as a big problem as other countries, but it is."
10005,"It is just that people accept more it so they talk less or are less open about it, especially to foreigners."
10006,"It felt random as I wrote it, but I broke a tooth biting into a peanut butter granola bar a few weeks ago, and my neighbor got Puerto Rican food delivered yesterday."
10007,Subconscious mind in action.
10008,All my family except me and my brother are tested positive for Covid on 18 Jan 2021.
10009,But i have an Exam ( must be present on the exam centre to attend) on 22nd Jan which I cannot postpone.
10010,Is it possible for me to attend the exams ?
10011,Or should I stay quarantined?
10012,A new form of diplomacy ... getting goodwill that is cheaper than a F16.
10013,All I was meaning by my original comment is that you cannot say - if something is to happen it will happen shortly after the vaccine.
10014,"ADE could take months/years to show itself, and we do not have the data to sufficiently say if this will be a problem going forward."
10015,"Unlikely, but still something we should be talking about and should be part of an informed decision making process before consenting the the vaccine."
10016,Downvoting me for something there is plenty of literature on seems a bit silly?
10017,"Of course, but that ship has sailed because the first charges are alloted elsewhere."
10018,So there is nothing intentional on the current slow speed.
10019,"Honestly, there isn't too much room for improvement for those two."
10020,"Interesting, I'd always thought it couldn't survive long on surfaces, but I suppose that only applies to inorganic surfaces."
10021,Feeling a bit safer as a veggie now!
10022,I like how you work shopped this comment by PMing me multiple times you sad sad little man.

10030,"A big problem is a lot of the time if they get caught they'll just move to different accounts, the internet's still the wild west in a lot of senses"
10031,&gt; The Bavarian state has pledged to provide 2.5 million of them free of charge for people in need.
10032,"If it works as good as the financial support for students during the Corona crisis, a lot of them are not covered and already in huge financial stress."
10033,100 fucking percent.
10034,I think there is much more than healthy school lunches that need to happen.
10035,Some schools have literally gotten rid of recess.
10036,Like play time.
10037,Active time for children.
10038,This is horrible.
10039,"Though kids may carry the virus, the chances of them getting **super sick** are very very very low."
10040,Extremely low.
10041,Its still a good step in the right direction!!
10042,Healthy food options!
10043,Just eat some damned vegetables!!
10044,There are plenty of good steps one can do to get healthy.
10045,A simple thing would be take a good supplement after having blood work done to see if you are deficient.
10046,"I *know* I am vitamin D deficient, so I take a supplement."
10047,"And to help my immune system, I take a C and NAC supplement too."
10048,"These are per my dietitians recommendations, but any dr can run blood tests and tell you your deficiencies."
10049,There are even avenues where you can get a full spectrum blood test done for *cheap* and have a dr give you a few recommendations.
10050,Another would be to just walk for a few mins every day.
10051,Simple things like little bits of exercise go a **LONG WAY!!**.
10052,I have nerve damage from an injury in the air force that limits my mobility - this is bad for me because it will only get worse.
10053,So I try and stretch and walk a bit up and down some stairs to give me a bit of exercise.
10054,"I cant do much, but I can do *something*."
10055,You see how you can affect your own health by making good choices?
10056,"We dont have to be **perfect**, but if you dont wanna get sick, dont give your body the ability to get sick."
10057,"Some things cant be prevents, but general health is **ALWAYS** a good thing!!"
10058,There are plenty of healthy things anyone can do to strengthen their own immune system.
10059,Simple changes - but people dont wanna change.
10060,"They wanna be able to eat like shit, dont get the right vitamins, dont sleep or rest enough, stress their body out like crazy, barely exercise and **STILL** not get sick."
10061,It just doesnt work.
10062,Gotta take care of the human body machine.
10063,"Its a machine, it needs good fuel and constant care."
10064,"Oh and according to my girlfriend who is a registered dietitian - pop tarts, even though they say fortified with vitamins and minerals on the box, are **not** a substitute for good nutrition."
10065,"I dont get what she means though, they literally have strawberries on the package and strawberries are a fruit.🤷‍♂️"
10066,You should check the definition of Herd immunity and also India population.
10067,We've been in the same boat down in San Diego.
10068,They only opened it to over 75 year-olds today because not enough healthcare workers were signing up.
10069,I agree.
10070,This guy did a tremendous job except when he started talking about the Civil Rights Act and the ADA.
10071,"It should be as simple as, ""Corporate has instructed us that we are to deny entry to anyone refusing to wear a mask, and that we have the legal authority to do so."
10072,"We have also been told to ask anyone creating a disruption in either the store or the parking lot to vacate the premises."""
10073,"If they refuse to leave, say you're calling the police, that security cameras are recording their faces and car license plates, and that if they refuse to leave when asked, but leave before the police arrive, the store will press charges with local authorities."
10074,"Back in the old days, retail stores had very-public signage warning shoppers that ALL trespassers will be prosecuted -- they wanted to make it clear that no matter how minor the theft was, they would pursue it, as a general deterrant."
10075,"I think in situations like this, the extra step that may be needed, since the police won't come to the stores, is the stores will have to go to the police and provide the evidence and prosecute these people for trespassing."
10076,Let these idiots go before an actual judge and try to make their nonsensical legal arguments about how the ADA or CRA require stores to let them in without masks.
10077,Let a judge and a prosecutor disabuse them of the crackpot legal theories they learned from some dumbass Facebook post.
10078,Why is there a blind test group?
10079,Why are people out of a scientific setting being allowed to mix with the general population at all while on the trial?
10080,"I get the vaccine has been rushed through, I get that it’s entirely a man made vaccine, I get the time constraints I really do..but why isn’t there the usual clinical trials going on in the background."
10081,In controlled environments.
10082,How could the data be used if the test subject could in effect contract all and any types of viruses?
10083,Maybe people in the UK are trying to cheer themselves up as a distraction from their own terrible mishandling of the pandemic
10084,Anyone know of a vaccine timeline state by state in the US?
10085,"https://www.nationalgeographic.com/science/2020/10/why-people-are-coronavirus-superspreaders-how-body-emits-infectious-particles/

I mean, you can just google it lmao."
10086,The research is ongoing but there is a general consensus.
10087,But he’s not making any medical advice nor did he make any claims.
10088,But you did.

10090,"&gt; “As a goodwill gesture, the government is planning to send Covaxin to Mongolia, Oman, Myanmar, Philippines, Bahrain, Maldives and Mauritius,” said a senior official, who was part of the meeting."
10091,"“Covishield will be sent to Bhutan, Afghanistan, Nepal, Bangladesh, and Seychelles,” the official added."
10092,Very kind.
10093,We need other countries to do this.
10094,This is good news!
10095,I use nicotine patches to treat my narcolepsy and I’ve done so for 7 years (never been a smoker).
10096,I still got whacked with a pretty moderate case of covid :(
10097,"In Austria we have both... a ""hard"" lockdown but skiing is allowed, lifts are open, albeit at max half capacity."
10098,Yes.
10099,Just like how flu mutations don’t make the flu vaccine useless
10100,It's not about the lockdowns in China.
10101,"It's about the complete lack of transparency during the early stages of the pandemic, that's what did the most damage."
10102,I have no interest in discussing with you further btw.
10103,Bye
10104,So most die in hospital which makes sense.
10105,Dude same.
10106,Wtf is it with these never ending body aches.

10220,Bats commonly have coronavirus.
10221,These bats didn’t have COVID - the disease caused by SARS-CoV-2.
10222,This is garbage.
10223,I piss in jars to save drinking water and smell my own farts so they don’t escape into the atmosphere.
10224,EXACTLY
10225,"Uh, in April (Or maybe early May?"
10226,"), mass Serology showed NYC reached 20% of the population infected during the first wave."
10227,Most early Serology studies were shitty cause they were done on so few people in places where the virus just wasn't prevalent.
10228,The government doesn't give a shit about your health.
10229,"I’ve said it in other threads but basically: the things that aren’t going back to 2019 normal are things that are a net positive for people and dont disrupt their lives: more work from home flexibility despite a definite return for most (think more bosses who would’ve made someone use sick time before now allowing them to work from home while sick), better hygiene practices."
10230,I think people will think more about using sanitizer and washing their hands more than just after using the bathroom.
10231,"I think countries like the US will build in better sick time for all jobs rather than force people to come to work sick, more time spent outside, more eating areas outside, more engagement with outdoor activities and outdoor vacations, better ventilation in homes and businesses (opening windows and doors and leaving them open more) and other things that don’t disrupt society."
10232,"What’s not going to stay gone are events, gatherings, parties, full stadiums, weddings, funerals, live theater, concerts."
10233,"These are the things humans crave, work for, save for, live for."
10234,Banning things like live entertainment and gatherings for social creatures like humans leads to humans seeking other outlets for what these events bring.
10235,Ultimately you’d just end up with backyard hidden theater performances and live music.
10236,You can’t stop these things from taking place so the goal is to get them back open.
10237,"At a certain point when hospitals aren’t at risk of overflow, personal risk assessment is back on the table and we will all decide what we do and don’t want to participate in again."
10238,"Kinda weird how Scotland, England, Wales, and Northern Ireland are all listed separately."
10239,Especially when the UK is also listed.
10240,"Especially when they've ""all"" approved the same vaccines anyway (can one even be approved for them individually anyway?)"
10241,Exactly.
10242,It’s just a political stunt.
10243,In April he was complaining the federal govt needs to coordinate buying not individual states.
10244,Now he wants to buy on his own.
10245,If trump told him the sky was blue he would disagree.
10246,Are you a citizen or resident of Australia?

10251,That's great.
10252,"We have one chain in my area doing pick-up, but it's hard to get a slot, and it's also in stores that are open for in-person shopping."
10253,Irresponsible headline.
10254,They’re saying it’s a possibility because they haven’t proved it hasn’t.
10255,That’s how science works.
10256,The chances of it requiring a new vaccine are extremely low.
10257,Like &lt;.01% chance low.
10258,Lol I think you're getting downvoted by Chinese bots with this comment
10259,They’re both frauds.
10260,One is a guy so in love with himself that he commissioned a victory poster back in June with his daughters shown as pulling down the covid curve.

10262,Not a concern my friend.
10263,Shitpost quality / positive outlook is all ive got.

10267,Any way to convince my friends and family about it?

10284,Measles has an Reff of 12-18  There is no way a new covid variant would increase the Reff it would be nowhere near that high.

10586,(I was going to say inaccurate; but given the context that seemed poor taste.
10587,Not too poor taste to mention tho.)
10588,It would not surprise me at all to hear some announcements literally Thursday morning.
10589,I think he has a good staff and they've been planning for months.
10590,"Sounds like they have been in touch with the pharma companies, the ""warp speed"" people, state governors, CDC, WHO already."
10591,They know this is everyone's top issue.
10592,"The ""vaccinate 100M people in 100 days"" is really kind of a soft ball target so I hope it's more than that."
10593,The hold up with vaccines is really at the state and local level.
10594,Biden is limited in what he can do there but he can ask Congress for money.
10595,"He can probably influence if or how the CDC is involved there, some say the CDC has been holding them back."
10596,Simply communicating a consistent high level strategy will help all by itself.
10597,Well said.. sire but we must saddle our horses and head for the holy land
10598,Back to the threats and prayers for death.
10599,And delusions of what I said or didn't say.
10600,And you and people who think like you are paragons of rationality?
10601,You're tearing apart nothing.
10602,But feel free to pretend you are.
10603,What's one more delusion to add to your pile?
10604,I can only speak for Sweden but we will get significantly more vaccine doses each week from march forward.
10605,Like 5x more than now.
10606,"Something like 500k a week, so about 2 million a month."
10607,We have a population of 10 million
10608,"In other words, the next time a pandemic hits, we're all getting lockdowns and nothing else."
10609,"This is related to masks, and airborne spread."
10610,"So, I've looked through various articles on airborne spread, and what I'm looking for is how small indoor aerosolized covid particulates become once they've reached that stage."
10611,The only thing I've found is that they are smaller than 5 microns.
10612,"The virus in and of itself is usually .125 microns, but always are carried by a larger vessel."
10613,"Is there a general consensus on just how small respiratory aerosols become before they completely evaporate, and will my mask protect against their smallest form ?"
10614,"I've found that masks, such as surgical masks, N95s, KN95s are electrostatically charged, aiding in filtering."
10615,My question regarding that is do P100 cartridges(for half-face respirator) have the same electrostatic as the aforementioned types of masks?
10616,"Thanks, if anyone can answer."
10617,I would greatly appreciate it.
10618,"They could make it in his backyard for all I care, but if there’s a backlog of orders, getting actual vials in stock won’t happen by the time the ones *already ordered* for the state have been distributed."
10619,It does sound like she has mental issues.
10620,I can't imagine anybody sane doing that
10621,HaVe FuN!
10622,I’m sure I will have more fun than someone who will stay inside their house for another few years lmao.
10623,[removed]
10624,I think even the 100 days will be a tough sell.
10625,From Jan 20 that is May 1.
10626,"And as you point out, the past 10 months have been one long 30 day lockdown."
10627,I think the real question is what has to happen in order for them to start to let up on the restrictions.
10628,I hope it is a decline in hospitalizations and fatalities but not necessarily a decline in cases.
10629,Illnesses are very concentrated in the elderly so once they are vaccinated the illnesses should drop way off even while we still having cases.
10630,It's more like having 2 kids farting while the other x# of kids all sit in piles of their own shit and make a colossal deal out of those 2 kids.
10631,I thought you meant the actual drug class known as immunosuppressants.
10632,As in the type of drug transplant patients need to take in order to prevent organ rejections.
10633,I thought I may have missed something new in the weight lifting world!
10634,We are moving across the country.
10635,My 76 yr old husband will get his first shot this Saturday.
10636,(And hopefully me the following week.)
10637,Do we need to get the second shot before flying to our new state?
10638,Or how soon after the first shot should we consider it safe to go?

10663,I don’t really have much issue with those.
10664,People that travel there to get a shot and don’t have any connection to the state is is much more controversial.
10665,"Also with the snowbirds, if they are living in Florida for the winter it isn’t very reasonable to expect them to travel back to their state of residence just to get a shot then have to do the same 3-4 weeks later."
10666,The main issue would be if the snowbird population was factored into distribution and the allotment the state receives from the federal government.

10686,They all suck.
10687,Closed the borders to the US the same day you guys did Feb 1st I believe.
10688,I maybe wrong.
10689,"On March 11th, you have Politicians from New York and California go on TV and encourage Dinning out."
10690,Also for weeks before that they were publicly saying the shut downs from China were “racist “.
10691,Shortly later we had hundreds of thousands taking to the streets in protest for for civil rights while simultaneously running articles that there is no evidence these are spreading transmission.
10692,Around the same time Trump was holding rallies ( stupid ) and the media was tearing him apart for transmission possibilities.
10693,He then switched those to outdoor gatherings which didn’t stop the criticism.
10694,"My point is, and maybe you can shed some clarity on this- America is crazy divided politically."
10695,Politics sadly drove many people to believe one way or the other.
10696,The left believed in science if it fit their narrative.
10697,The right disregarded most of it.
10698,But strangely most of the high density outbreaks were in Democrat ran cities.
10699,"This doesn’t seem to be the case in Australia, it seems both sides of the isle pit differences aside during those times and the media did the same?"
10700,early data from israel seems to confirm both a drop in hospitalizations and transmission into vaccinated groups.
10701,No flu or heart disease.

10845,There's also at least some evidence these viral vector vaccines do as well (or even better) when the doses are spread further apart.

10853,this case is a little bit odd.
10854,In many cases this is true that the US holds doses of vaccines or other things for ourselves that could better go to other countries.
10855,"In this case, it's actually probably the most rational thing for the world for the US and Europe to use their doses first as they are the ones that seem to be impacted the most."
10856,How is that so?
10857,The business has the right to refuse service to anyone (unless it is because of a protected class).
10858,If someone does not respect that refusal of service then they are trespassing.

10875,As a result their government is held accountable for adverse reactions to the vaccines and the rollout is going very slowly there.

10888,How can you even be skeptic of this lol
10889,Until these types of outcomes occur much more frequently I don’t see why they need to say anything.
10890,"We know it can kill, it’s just that it’s extremely EXTREMELY unlikely in healthy individuals under 45ish."
10891,When you get enough cases you will eventually have outliers.
10892,"Many other sicknesses can randomly kill
otherwise healthy individuals as well."
10893,If this becomes a more common thing that’s very concerning.
10894,That’s fine.
10895,Hopefully that’ll bump me up In the line.
10896,Idk why you’re being downvoted so much.
10897,This is a largely liberal sub that has been saying “we’re all in this together” for months and months.
10898,But now we apparently aren’t?
10899,Got it.
10900,Do they have any actual data???
10901,?
10902,People under 55 are not all magically immune to it.
10903,"Many still die and many, many more develop long term health issues from it."
10904,This bizarre narrative that everyone under 55 should just be happy to get the virus and we can all totally ignore it is absolute nonsense.
10905,"Huge sections of society, including young people, developing long-term health issues is not a no-brainer solution to blindly accept with no thought whatsoever."
10906,"My childhood best friend is a nursing home worker in New York State and she refuses to be vaccinated, because she said it wouldn't ""make \[her\] feel safer."""
10907,"Because we all know that vaccine efficacy is measured based on how one *feels*, not on data, right?"
10908,"I compared it to wearing a seat belt; she said ""I don't wear a seat belt."""
10909,"Then she went on and on about her ""independence"" and being a ""non-conformist,"" as if a highly contagious, dangerous infectious disease is a lifestyle choice."
10910,There's no reasoning with these types of people; it's like talking to a brick wall.
10911,And they make up at least a third of the U.S. population.
10912,Everything needs to start somewhere ;)
10913,Seems like a scary path down a road linking ability to earn == being vaccinated.
10914,"Fast forward 10 years, refuse a vaccination, lose the ability to earn."
10915,[removed]
10916,Because of limited supply.
10917,If AZ does not get approved the US only has enough doses for around 30% of the population in Q1.
10918,So with those 30% you won't achieve herd immunity but you can reduce deaths.

10924,"[There are 3,600,000 cashiers in the US](https://www.bls.gov/ooh/sales/cashiers.htm), so I don't think they would be able to find 3,6 million people to fill those positions, if they all went on trike simultaneously."

10927,"How many times, we were operating under the withdrawal agreement."
10928,We were no longer EU members.
10929,Think about this.
10930,Any EU wide mandate on vaccine procurement would not include the UK as it would have been implemented after the UK left the EU.
10931,How are you not getting this?
10932,The UK ceased to be a member of the EU at the end of January 2020.

10936,We are not going to keep precautions in place to prevent a handful of covid deaths a day.

10965,"There we go, we will be in 2022 within 6 months."
10966,"first it was mid 2020, then late 2020, early 2021, late 2021.."
10967,I had a tough time swallowing pills when I was a kid.
10968,"Have you tried having them sip water first, then holding it in the mouth, then dropping the pill in?"
10969,Makes it much easier to swallow in my experience.

10978,We'll stop saying it when we start to see a decrease in cases.
10979,"You got to stop thinking ""endgame"" in terms of time and think in terms of goal."
10980,This will end when cases go down and don't go up.
10981,It's not a hard concept to grasp.
10982,"So until then, we need to do what's safe and wear a mask."
10983,It's not a hard thing to do.
10984,The daily death count is higher than it's ever been and you want to everything to back to normal again?
10985,Dude I'm sorry but you're so dumb.
10986,Also it's a pretty dick thing to not give a fuck about the people dying from this and not realizing people like you are why we've been prolonging the quarantine.
10987,"Here's the science, the virus is really good in evading the immune system, so we don't know how effective the immune response has been in preventing further infections or capacity to spread to others (basically who know how long your antibodies last)."
10988,"So they're asking those that have still been infected to still get vaccinated, because we know the vaccine will induce a strong enough immune response."
10989,"Therefore, just because you've been infected, doesn't mean you can't spread it."
10990,"I take you're the type of guy to call this BS, so I don't think I can help you further."

11005,can we lost the spam sticky about vaccines?
11006,we all already saw this.
11007,it's clutter.
11008,I have no idea what I just read.
11009,Can you dumb it down?
11010,"Just to manage your expectations I don’t think people will ruin their lives over a very small percentage of people developing long-term symptoms, most states base restrictions on hospitalizations too, I’m sorry there’s just 0 percent chance people are waiting all year for that."

11024,Exactly.
11025,I was ringing the alarm a few days ago.

11032,There is a lot of irresponsible journalism going on lately with this virus/vaccine.
11033,"These pieces should be a lot more speculative IMO and explain to people what it means to link something like this, and also explain that the risks of this vaccine are FAR less than the virus."

I'd rather they do this so I'll know what's the worst case scenario than be complacent and then have a nasty surprise later."
11039,I think we do need to move that goalpost to allow non-at risk folks to get it as well; a significant percentage of non-at risk (for death) patients seem to be developing long-COVID symptoms.
11040,"Death isn't the only problem here, overwhelming medical systems and long-term health concerns are also considerations."
11041,"It definitely increases your risk, but “high-risk” will still depend partially on your age."

11044,Better choices could have been made earlier on.
11045,Your point of view is so callous.
11046,It’s as if you don’t think people should be paid for all the hours they work.

11064,"Plus whatever amount of vaccines going to a 3rd world country at this point will just be robbed and not given to the intended population (first responders - elderly), so they would end up sending vaccines to politicians/richs."
11065,"Yeah, blame other countries for your lack of preparation and efficiently managing funds and logistics during a pandemic, and overall corruption and negligence throughout decades."
11066,"Source: I'm from a 3rd world country and expect to be able to buy the vaccine whenever a big pharma imports it at a huge markup, as it will take ages for it to be publicly available."

11074,The Norway deaths thing was incredibly irresponsible reporting.
11075,"The people who died were 80+ and very frail with significant health conditions, AND the number of them who died in the weeks following the vaccine was on par with the number of people in that population you would expect to die regardless."

11091,It's easy to virtue signal on the internet.
11092,Vaccines cost money.
11093,Lots of money.
11094,"The biggest economic players in the world, the only ones capable of bankrolling such an astronomical task, paid for it."
11095,Do you think any reality exists where they would've done that if they weren't promised doses?
11096,Stop living in your idealistic fantasy and come down to reality.
11097,"Yes, the world is an unjust place."
11098,"I'm not sure what you want anyone to do about it, just give all our vaccines to other countries (a monumental task, especially for countries that don't have extensive supply lines like the US) and let our economy crumble permanently until we vaccinate every old person in every third world country?"
11099,They have this potato soup in a plastic microwavable cup that is unreasonably good.
11100,Yeah.
11101,"While it's not cool that China initially tried to hide it for a little bit, they still told the world early enough where there was still plenty that could've been done."

11103,"If you criticized Cuomo in the NYC sub, you were called a right wing troll."
11104,"I think that’s eased up a bit lately, but for a while it was impossible to even have a conversation about it."
11105,People haven't been vaccinated for long enough to make that claim.
11106,"Cases generally only start coming down two weeks after vaccination, and hospitalisations and deaths would take about a month."
11107,"Israel has had a terrible outbreak over the last month (at the worst point, equivalent to about 300,000 cases per day for the US), so it's no surprise that lots of people are testing positive after getting vaccinated."
11108,"Most of those people would have been infected before the vaccine had a chance to give them protection, or even before they got the vaccination at all (remember that there's a delay of about a week between catching the virus and showing symptoms)."
11109,"You could have a one-shot vaccine that produced 100% immunity, but it wouldn't stop people testing positive if they caught the virus before it had a chance to induce an immune response."
11110,"Sure it may reduce transmission but it doesn't mean you can't spread the virus, nor should we assume until we have enough data."
11111,"But by that time, we will have easily reached herd immunity through vaccination, so its irrelevant."
11112,Literally talking just a few months difference between when first vaccinated vs last vaccinated in any given country for the most part.
11113,"Point being since they haven't confirmed, is it really that hard to keep masking up for a couple more months after vaccinated to give everyone a chance?"
11114,"We can conclude now that this study was very misleading, even for the whole world."
11115,At least in my experience it's more that the kinda shitty supermarkets are the ones where people don't wear them while the better ones have cashiers wearing them even behind the plastic windows.
11116,We only knew this last year...but thanks all the same.
11117,This should be the norm really.
11118,Saves the company money in the long run and good PR.
11119,Antibodies are not the only component of immunity
11120,[deleted]
11121,Man.
11122,"In the US, even as New York was getting destroyed, it was only enough for states to half-ass measures."
11123,6 weeks from the start of vaccinations is an “estimated” timeline of when we will start to see an impact.
11124,"The issue is the rollout was so slow, that that impact will be small."
11125,6 weeks from now I’m betting our new infected cases will be in free fall.
11126,Don't worry guys.
11127,Just a bad flu.
11128,[/s]
11129,"Okay, so you prefer individual rights over the society's wellness, nothing wrong with that."
11130,But saying a country is wrong for doing the opposite and preventing millions from getting sick and dying is just baffling.
11131,I once went through 3 interviews with 3 diff people for a corporate job at aldi that paid $15/hr.
11132,They required a bachelors degree and previous work experience and the interviews were extensive.
11133,I was so mad they were making me jump through hoops (come in twice for in person interviews) for such a low paying job that I did not accept their offer.
11134,I now wish I would have told them right to their faces how ridiculous they are.
11135,they wouldn't be getting any vaccines at all for god knows how long if it wasn't for rich countries.
11136,this entitlement is insane.
11137,"I’m really not sure as to the specifics of the contract, and I hope the lawyer helps out."
11138,I would legitimately just question the manager why the new employee hadn’t shown up though.
11139,The first day I realized what was happening.
11140,"The second day I’d offer to take care of the “other duties the manager needed completed, while they took care of finding a cashier.” 

The third day of them asking if I could be a stand in cashier I’d say, “ha."
11141,Ha ha ha!
11142,"Ha ha, ha, oh man, that was funny."
11143,"Ha ha, hahaha.”"
11144,"J&amp;J is behind in production though, so even if its' approved in the coming weeks it will take months for significant doses to arrive."
11145,Same.
11146,"My Moderna vaccine was 11 days ago and my rapid antibody test showed me positive for IgG antibodies (negative for IgM, which is to be expected)."
11147,I also got blood drawn today for a blood-based antibody test and so that should be more definitive.

11179,He was the one who set them up.. hospitals had to transfer patients to those tents you couldn’t deliver patients directly to them via ambulance.
11180,Lot of hospitals because of being overrun and lack of coordination never transferred them.
11181,Everyone loves to shut on Cuomo for nursing homes when it was very early on and very little was known.

Especially if you got a viral vector vaccine first, there may be vector immunity that cancels out part of the protective immune response from the boost shot if it's the same vector virus."
11475,"This is why the Russian Sputnik vaccine uses two different vectors, one in each shot."
11476,To my knowledge we're not 100% sure about vector resistance (wrong term?)
11477,yet.
11478,"So priming with the more available AZ/Ox vaccine and boosting with one of the mRNA vaccines might be cheaper, easier to distribute (because of manufacturing times/ramp ups), and more effective."

11529,This is what happens when you have people in positions of power and influence setting a poor example.
11530,Anyone apocalypse-posting was dumb but to be fair cases did rise pretty quickly after new years and Christmas when it looked like we may have been plateauing.
11531,"But, now that its been just over two weeks since NYE so it makes sense that our cases would begin to decline now."
11532,Deaths and hospitalizations might continue to rise though as they lag about a week or two behind.
11533,One has nothing to do with the other.
11534,"Yes, Li Wenliang was only forwarded that lab report, it wasn't his investigation."

11537,"Uh, what?"
11538,"Pre-pandemic if you wore a mask in public you would be stared at, whispered about, as if they were lepers (I have a couple friends who are immunosuppressed and would wear them on public transit)."
11539,"Now that it has been “normalized”, I sure as shit hope that people wear masks when sick in public (or are trying to avoid getting sick in public)."

11582,Why are you talking about white people???
11583,"I never mentioned white or black people, just nations."
11584,only people who got the vaccine are healthcare workers and old people.
11585,infections are high cause younger people don't listen to instructions

11615,"Well things could have gone better in most Western countries if they had taken more action before things got really bad, especially when the fall wave started."
11616,We probably should've treated it more like Melbourne did; especially in Europe doing this instead of letting it go out of control in the fall could have beaten the virus already.

11641,I kind of wonder though if this could also partially be biased as a loss of smell is so obvious that you would immediately go get tested.
11642,"As far as I know, other common signs of covid are fever, cough, sore throat, shortness of breath."
11643,"And all those symptoms are so common for every cold, flu or whatever virus, that if you have those symptoms but only in a slight form you might not go get tested."
11644,"But loss of smell is quite unique for Covid, so people experiencing this symptom get tested and lots of other people also having mild Covid, but without a loss of smell don't get tested so are lost to the statistics?"
11645,"Because the EU chooses to display timelines based on ALL their ordered vaccines being approved, while Canada, the UK, and some EU countries like Germany only based their timelines on approved vaccines, not ones that haven’t been proven to work yet or just plain haven’t received their regulatory aporoval."

11666,"What about the ""hug a Chinese"" campaign in Italy that happened in February?"
11667,"I'm ethnically Chinese, but I still think that was pretty dumb."
11668,We don't know because the federal health authorities never bothered to set up a national surveillance system to detect variants and their spread.
11669,"The absence of evidence isn't the evidence of absence in this case, and it doesn't mean it hasn't spread out from Arizona,"
11670,"When there's a surge of 3k per day in a second wave, i don't think it's all reinfections cases."
11671,"There's a lot going on, but in no way 60% of a 2,4 million population in Manaus have all gotten in the first wave, if only in the second wave entire families are getting at the same time."
11672,"For anyone who has gone through one of the vaccine trials, what was the actual experience like?"
11673,I have a chance to get into the novavax one.
11674,"If you participated in a trial, did you have to wait with a lot of others or generally be exposed to a lot of people in the process?"
11675,"It sounds silly but I’m not worried about the vaccine, I’m afraid of catching covid from the environment I’d have to go into in order to participate."
11676,I think it is less an issue with this sub and more an issue with the type of headlines news is putting out.
11677,It would be a sub issue if we only saw one type of those headlines here and the other excluded.
11678,But it's a news media issue that they only mostly publish those two types of headlines because they know they will generate the most clicks.
11679,And then you click and read the article and it is even as dire or as hopeful as the headline made it sound
11680,Feigl is a nutritionist and has as much business making claims and determining implications from this paper as a doctor of internal medicine.
11681,"These are the authors regarding their findings of the paper Fiegel cites:

""But biggest priority is vaccinate!"
11682,"Despite above, I'm confident current  vaccines will be useful for quite a while."
11683,"Reasons: (a) even worst  mutations (ie, E484) only erode neut activity of some sera, don't  eliminate it for any, (b) current vaccines elicit strong immunity (c)  evidence in animals (&amp; from humans after 1st vaccine dose) that  modest immunity can blunt disease, (d) natural immunity to seasonal CoV  provides some homologous protection for 3+ years even though they evolve  too."""
11684,So Feigl is just wrong.
11685,"In those states, yes."
11686,Most of these states have a system where the amount of paid sick leave is based on the amount of hours you work.
11687,"For example, in my state, Vermont, you are entitled 1 hour of sick leave per 52 hours of work (this is the lowest ratio out of the states I have heard of, some give 1 hour per 30 hours)."
11688,"This amount caps off at 40 hours in Vermont, though."
11689,"Lots of room for improvement, but better than absolutely no laws being in place."
11690,"Unions also have a lot of pull in some industries as well, but generally they don't protect the average cashier just trying to get by."
11691,"Of course he wasn't alone , but for the polio vaccine he absolutely was the captain of the ship."
11692,Over 10% of the population is infected.
11693,"Health workers were already working hard, but right now it's even worse."
11694,Everybody is describing it as a war-like scenario.
11695,Not enough ventilators to go around and now they're forced to decide who gets to live and who doesn't.
11696,So yeah.
11697,"It is indeed on the brink of collapse, if not collapsing already."

11729,Is something preventing you from reading the article?
11730,This isn't new.
11731,Last March the WHO said if the world hit 100 million cases that we would have a seasonal pandemic based on virus mutation.
11732,"I know they aren't the most popular resource on Reddit and among Americans, but this information has been public and readily available for a year."
11733,"It's why there was even a debate last summer over why herd immunity wasn't viable -- to get herd immunity by infection, the virus will mutate rnough to invalidate that immunity."
11734,They might be quite low but it's so rampant amongst the community there are going to be plenty of examples.
11735,Plus people who have had it are probably more likely to expose themselves to risk.
11736,"If you mean the Manaus immunity study reported in Nature, let’s hope it was wildly wrong and that we’re seeing first infections surging now."
11737,You're confusing hypothesis with fact.
11738,**Hypothesis**: I hypothesize that vaccinated people cannot spread covid.
11739,**Fact**: It is currently unknown if vaccinated people can still spread covid.
11740,"In this case, acting on the untested and unproven hypothesis can potentially maim and kill other people."
11741,Scientists do not attempt to substitute ad hominems for scientific debate.
11742,Yep had weird tingling in my tongue and tastes of smoke randomly.
11743,"Pfizer is only claiming 50.7% efficacy after dose 1, hence the reason its a 2 dose vaccine."
11744,Whereas Moderna's is closer to 80% after dose 1.
11745,"This ""reduced efficacy"" can possibly be explained by the behavior of individuals post disease 1."
11746,Exactly.
11747,"This is great news because it moves people up the list, and only at the expense of idiots"
11748,If the vaccine program goes well and we’re out of lockdowns sooner than mainland Europe I’ll consider that a win.
11749,As for the withdrawal agreement.
11750,I haven’t read it but I’m assuming it’s more than one page saying “everything stays the same until we do a trade deal”.
11751,"You can think I’m arguing semantics, but I’m not."
11752,From the end of January 2020 we stopped being EU members.
11753,Could be that’s had some benefit in being able to procure more vaccines faster than those still in the EU.
11754,Oh and the program had nothing to do with getting better prices negotiated as a block.
11755,It was to do with France wanting in on the action with its Sanofi vaccine.
11756,Unfortunately they shit the bed on that one.
11757,And??
11758,Who here spoke about white people?
11759,"I'm talking about western nations that the most wealthy ones happen to be the ones that profited from centuries of genocide, enslavement and colonialism of other nations (including mostly white nations like Poland and Ukraine)."
11760,&gt;Why can't I wear a mask when I have a cold?
11761,you can!
11762,I just don't want mandates.
11763,"before all this, people would look at you funny because millenia of human evolution have hard-wired us to be wary of someone whose face we cannot see."
11764,Even China committing to vaccine the African continent is related to business ties.
11765,They've been funding projects in Africa for many years to build relationships with governments there.
11766,"Here is the constitution of China, clarifying your misunderstanding of local government structure."

11768,I was trying to say it’s pretty clear at this point that COVID-19 does not cause ADE
11769,[removed]
11770,"Can expect reopening by May barring loss of immunity in a significant way from new strains(even if 50 percent get reinfected, if it's largely mild that's a short term issue)."
11771,"I mean again, if your going to be historically illiterate don’t try and argue from a position of contemporary morality."
11772,"King L2 was a private individual who never stepped foot in the Congo personally, if the modern state of Nigeria isn’t responsible for the individual actions of their mercenary’s then the “west” isn’t responsible for the actions of the private enterprise of the Congo free state."
11773,Yeah but thankfully I guessed correctly that I was a placebo and made sure to stay safe.
11774,So I never got sick and got the benefits of being in the trial without actually being tested on haha
11775,"Lol they’re all gonna slowly drive past us while we’re out at bars in their cars alone with their masks on seething with rage, then go back home and type out their anger on this sub and then try and upvote themselves."
11776,Jonas Salk would like a word
11777,Isn’t it based on dependent status?
11778,Shouldn’t you be ineligible regardless if you are working?
11779,What about Costco?
11780,[removed]
11781,That isn't going to happen and it's absurd to believe it will or should.
11782,"My experience was it was a ""poor"" grocery store in Iowa but in Chicago it has a much smaller to almost none of that stigma."
11783,Hell of a rationalization for colonialism and oppression
11784,Well it really depends on the way you look and interpret data.
11785,"If you get your first dose today, and get exposed to the virus 5 days later, you’d hardly see any benefit."
11786,"If you get exposed 20 days later, then the first dose will provide great protection (80-ish percent reduction in cases I think for Pfizer/Biontech)."
11787,"Taiwan is part of China, currently occupied by the ROC government and considered part of China by 99% of the world's governments."
11788,"The ROC is and always will be the enemy of the PRC, you know, because of the civil war and them claiming to be the rightful rulers of all China?"
11789,Only 15 countries recognize the ROC government as the actual ruling government of China and that list is *not* filled with any countries with significant global power.
11790,The US being one that recognizes the PRC over the ROC.
11791,"Imagine, if you will, the Confederacy occupied Hawaii and then claimed to be the rightful government of the United States and actively tried to pursue overthrowing of the United States Government."
11792,How would the US react?
11793,How would any country react?
11794,Likely with defensive and offensive posturing and medium to long term plans for reunification.
11795,China has done more to help the global south in the last 10 years than the west has done in 300 years.
11796,"In fact while China has helped numerous African countries build infrastructure, the US has STILL insisted on regime change, militancy and corporate imperialism on the Continent."
11797,"Xi is in fact accountable to the Chinese people and to the Congress, and can and would be removed from power if he tried to become tyrannical."
11798,Your final statement is completely fallacious and there is absolutely no evidence to support your claim.
11799,What?
11800,"It doesn’t matter we test more than any other country, we have far more cases."
11801,It’s still absolutely the case that we don’t diagnose the vast majority of covid infections.
11802,"That’s not to blame anyone, it’s just a fact with the level of community spread we have in the US."
11803,"This is more true than at any time throughout the pandemic, especially April and May like you mistakenly reference."
11804,This sub feels like a damn yo-yo.
11805,"With the ""It's still not over, even after a vaccine!"""
11806,"articles and the ""This will be a gamechanger!"""
11807,articles.
11808,"It's kind of annoying, tbh."
11809,Yeah people are striving to see optimisim where there are none.
11810,"If Israel with a lockdown and the most vaccinated people per capita get only more and more cases than ever, then it's a pessimistic news for the rest of the world."
11811,"The number do add up, the covid beats the vaccination rate even when the vaccination rate is high."
11812,It's math.
11813,"The are models here in Israel that we are going to see 7,000 to 8,000 infections per day in MARCH."
11814,"I am not saying that the vaccinations are not effective, but it'll take long and deadly months for them to have a serious effect."
11815,Mmm the ones dying now are the offsprings of the ones survived the war.
11816,[removed]
11817,"Instead of hoping bad things happen to me, can you provide me with the evidence?"
11818,"I'm wide open to it, but haven't seen any."
11819,The Danish study showed masks have no significant impact on the spread of covid.
11820,Do you have another study showing something else?
11821,Unbelievable.
11822,Definitely validates the worry about the mental state of healthcare workers.
11823,We’re living through a pretty shitty chapter in future history books.
11824,[removed]
11825,It doesn't.
11826,I'm just saying maybe we will have a great president due to covid in the future.
11827,They're stealing our supermarkets!
11828,Oh covid sick leave.
11829,"I was talking just having sick leave as not being a part of my PTO (vacation) or in the case of when i worked at Wal-Mart, not a decision between eating or going into work sick."
11830,But itll be nice that some people will be able to again take care of their families and get the time off to do so.
11831,"In America, you’re not guaranteed any time off because there are no laws protecting labor (enforced, anyway.)"
11832,One year I worked every single holiday.
11833,That was before I finished college.
11834,It was the best job I ever had.
11835,Seriously.
11836,Whatever you say.
11837,It doesn't change the fact that you're wrong.
11838,So people are getting infected between doses?
11839,Before the vaccine has taken its full effect?
11840,Why is that a surprise?
11841,Wasn’t it only like 52% effective after the first dose and take up to a week to begin giving immunity?
11842,Phase 1 and 2 check for safety.
11843,Phase 3 checks for efficacy.
11844,"Based on results from phase 1 and 2, interm report from phase 3, and historical data on attenuated virus vaccines, Covaxin was determined approved for emergency use."
11845,"Okay, they didn’t approve an untested vaccine nor did they approve one with side-effects beyond the usual found in EVERY vaccine (injection site rash, allergic reaction to ingredients in vaccine, soreness)."
11846,So stop parading anti-vaxx propaganda when you don’t know crap about what you’re talking.
11847,It’s not as easy as just firing the people who won’t be vaccinated.
11848,LPNs and CNAs in nursing homes have physically and emotionally difficult jobs that pay very little.
11849,"If you fire the 37% who decline the vaccines, you have to find people to replace them, and for it to make sense, those people have to agree to be vaccinated."
11850,"For now, we’re better off focusing on education and incentives than firing people."
11851,Hopefully people’s first-hand experiences with people who are vaccinated will reduce their skepticism.
11852,And maybe once the Emergency Use Authorizations are replaced by full FDA approval that will make a difference.
11853,"&gt; Young people are dying too and ending

Yeah but in quite rare cases young people die of the flu and that wasn't really a concern of anyone pre-Covid."
11854,"BAsically when the vaccine is widespread enough that Covid is less deadly than the flu, and or prevalence is similar to the flu, we should be basically fully opened up as normal."
11855,There is very little reason to continue lockdown at that stage in my eyes.
11856,"They're dropping it because of stupid SJW nonsense, not because it doesn't work."
11857,I thought most estimates put that at 1:2 or 1:4 these days.
11858,"If 1:10 is true, states like AL are pretty close to herd immunity."
11859,"Good for you, but it’s outdated."

11862,"Actually there is strong evidence that FDR may actually have had an Autoimmune disease called Guilliane-Barre syndrome, of which his symptoms fall more in line with."
11863,It’s good news when it’s the UK.
11864,Never see these kinds of articles for the US.
11865,"Gonna be honest with ya, Chief."
11866,"Once I get a few weeks pass my 2nd dose, these masks are being tossed in the garbage."
11867,You're too dumb to even waste any more time on.
11868,"Reinfection ADE isn't a concern with this coronavirus:

https://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/archives/2020/12/18/antibody-dependent-enhancement"
11869,"With 650k deaths and a (for sake of argument) 0.7% case fatality rate, that would imply that 98.9 million Americans had contracted the coronavirus."
11870,"Assuming 11 million are vaccinated at least partially now, Biden hits his 100m doses in 100 days pledge, and the 4K deaths per day hold for a bit that would have the US hitting 650k deaths on 3/23."
11871,"At that point 48.5m Americans will have received 2 doses of the vaccine, per the Biden plan."
11872,I think we’re gonna blow past 650k.
11873,"Assuming herd immunity is at 70 percent of the country, we’re on pace (coincidentally) to achieve herd immunity on the 4th of July."
11874,"While the above vaccination and death totals obviously won’t hold up for 6.5 months, the number of deaths with those current rates would be 1.064 million and 94m vaccinated."
11875,"I haven’t had time to add seasonal decline or a death rate decay due to vaccination to this equation, but it’s safe to say that 650k deaths is going to be a very low number."
11876,"Another spike seems inevitable then, judging from people's reaction on here."
11877,The UK is no longer under the EU rules regime after completion of the transition.
11878,This is extremely simple which is why brain dead leavers will forever play too dumb to ever understand any of it.
11879,I am not disagreeing with you.
11880,"Apologies if I gave that impression, but even with neutralizing antibodies, and specially with severe disease, something seems to be happening"
11881,&gt; I can't imagine how many in the general population are going to do the same.
11882,"[The numbers are out there, if you're willing to look](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/health/2021/01/18/poll-covid-vaccine-acceptance-rises-pessimism-future-suffolk-poll/4196840001/)

56% willing to take it now."
11883,22% will take it after others do.
11884,18% still saying no.
11885,A drop from 20% in December.
11886,78% of the population being vaccinated is a great number.
11887,"Those that haven't gotten at that point will allow for a slow simmer of continued cases, but nothing to the extent of what's going on now and unlikely to even be at the level that we saw back in summer 2020."
11888,"And that's with rather minimal interventions (for instance, continued large scale testing and precautions regarding symptoms and masks in retail outlets, but little else)"
11889,Genuine question: 14 here.
11890,"If all of the adults get shots, what’s the risk of me catching this?"
11891,I really don’t want to have to wait another year for a shot if I can help it.

11899,Done.
11900,Sorry but turning life into mere existence is not acceptable.

https://www.timesofisrael.com/liveblog_entry/virus-czar-says-1st-dose-less-effective-than-pfizer-suggested-report/

Which (if true and I'm sceptical) throws other strategies like in the UK in a bad light."
11902,"I should have added it before:

https://www.idsociety.org/covid-19-real-time-learning-network/vaccines/moderna-covid-19-vaccine/

Delayed injection-site reactions (those with onset on or after day 8) were noted in 244 participants (0.8%) after the first dose and in 68 participants (0.2%) after the second dose."
11903,"Couldn't Africas low numbers also be a result of simply not being able to accurately get numbers because of low access to test kits, and inability to perform autopsies on everyone who dies?"
11904,"Journalists continue to abuse words like “could” and “may” and “might.”

It’s fearmongering for clicks."
11905,"When a scientist says “this might happen,” they don’t mean “eh, it’s about 50/50, either is equally likely.”  They could mean anything from “this will almost certainly not happen but we haven’t specifically designed a study to eliminate it as a possibility” to “there’s every reason to believe it will happen but maybe a meteor hits the earth tomorrow before it has a chance.”

You could write all the following headlines and they would all be technically true but give people very different takeaways:

“New variant may make vaccines less effective”

“No evidence new variant is covered by vaccines”

“No evidence new variant evades vaccines”

“New variant unlikely to make vaccines less effective”

“Vaccines expected to show efficacy on new variant”

“Scientists monitoring new variant that could make vaccines moot”


All of those headlines can be literally true at the same time"

11915,The source of an infection being so hard to track down is one of the reasons there are so many open questions about viral transmission.
11916,"I mean, there are so many potential points of transmission, even for those that act as cautiously as humanly possible."
11917,"&amp;nbsp;  
But acting pre-emptively, based on the limited knowledge and even more limited evidence, and possibly causing a panic about food (so many people only read headlines or social media and flip the F out without really understanding why they do so) could possibly even make matters worse."
11918,"To touch upon a somewhat similar issue: we know cats, dogs and ferrets can become infected with SARS-CoV-2, but so far we haven't established that they can in turn infect humans again."
11919,"It doesn't sound 100% implausible (at least not to me - it *is* a zoonotic virus after all), but at this point we simply don't know enough about that to use as a basis for policy."
11920,"So should there be a health advisory regarding pets (like keeping them outside when any of the human inhabitants of the household, or the animals themselves, show symptoms), just to err on the safe side of things?"
11921,"(just a hypothetical question, not an attack of you or your point of view)  
&amp;nbsp;  
For what it's worth: I've been ordering food at least once a week since the start of this pandemic (just like I did before), and although I don't want to dismiss the risk of food being a potential vector, I've decided - for myself - that it's not enough of an issue to change my habits in this respect (and I wouldn't tell others to do so either)."
11922,"And, as far as I'm aware, I haven't been infected yet."
11923,"&amp;nbsp;  
Hope you fully recovered from your infection, btw!"

11926,"Thank you, I appreciate it."
11927,Sorry to sound like an ass.

11932,Million doses that could protect so many vulnerable parents like mine
11933,The terrible irony is that it's the same generation dying the most too.
11934,Both.
11935,The federal government pays for the actual vaccine.
11936,"Those who actually give the shot, document it, etc."
11937,are paid for via 3rd parties.
11938,"In most cases that will be insurers, public insurance (Medicare, Medicaid, SCHIP, etc.)"
11939,and public health agencies like local health departments.
11940,We test more than almost every other country.

11982,These hospitals and the lockdown were a news item all over the world.
11983,Most governments outside of Asia still did very little.

12030,"The ones more suited to the environment thrive and the ones less suited die off, it's really that simple."
12031,We weren’t EU members during 2020.
12032,We were operating under the withdrawal agreement that was agreed during the article 50 process.
12033,I don’t know how else to say it to you.
12034,Didnt this dude say masks are dumb and made his workers work through a pandemic?
12035,But how safe would it be to give someone a new shot each time a new variant gets discovered
12036,Those are powerful numbers.
12037,Do you have links to these numbers?
12038,I would want to share these with my adminstration.
12039,/r/confidentlyincorrect
12040,"Are you 65+, or a healthcare worker?"
12041,Just curious who’s being vaccinated right now in NY
12042,"Wait, Aldi is also in America?"
12043,I get that but here in the UK and from what I’ve heard Europe too there’s no extra incentive to get it.
12044,Also I can’t imagine 4 hours minimum wage is going to convince anyone who’s mildly or completely apprehensive towards getting it otherwise.
12045,[removed]
12046,"And I've seen too many people saying things like ""I had it twice."
12047,"Earlier this year, and then recently."
12048,"No, I didn't get tested for it the first time, but I know I had it."""
12049,Do not spread misinformation.
12050,Exactly.
12051,"yeah, and to be fair they are an insanely good store to have in those areas."
12052,"They offer not only cheap foods, but healthy cheap foods that are so hard to find in poorer areas."
12053,"But without a doubt the quality is insanely good and it's more than a ""poor area store""."
12054,This ain't no piggly wiggly.
12055,It killed 500k last year and started in March yes it is
12056,"It's bad, but at least we aren't uniquely bad."
12057,"Per capita, we're still doing better than most of Europe outside the UK."
12058,"Granted, they started a couple weeks after we did so that'll remain to be seen."
12059,So many people.
12060,It hurts my heart.
12061,They have just become numbers and statistics to many.
12062,Nobody ever tests for sterilizing immunity in a vaccine trial.
12063,I've NEVER seen that as a secondary endpoint in any trial ever.
12064,Most of us just assume it will follow along the lines of every vaccine ever that reduces transmission at a minimum.
12065,"I'm so happy that basically everybody in my country is disobeying lockdowns, politicians have become crazy and we're paying the price."
12066,No.
12067,Not complying with this long game shit.
12068,Enough is enough.
12069,that sub is a circlejerk.
12070,Not surprised their are anti-vaxxers there
12071,Huge factor: A lot of the stuff like their chocolate are made in Europe.
12072,The quality is amazing compared to the crap made in the US.
12073,I have a staunch refusal to buy a lot of processed food from the US there's so much crap in them.
12074,&gt;States are struggling to plan their vaccination programs with just one week’s notice for how many doses they’ll receive from the federal government.
12075,The incoming Biden administration is deciding what to do with this dysfunctional system.
12076,Don't do that.
12077,Don't give me hope
12078,Thank you for clarifying!

12088,"Australia 

Be nice if you could get that 4 weeks in a row, but a total of 5 weeks per year is pretty good"
12089,You’re talking about such a little chance of spread that you might as well make everyone wear shoe coverings when they go into a store.
12090,It’s such a small percent of the spread.
12091,"If you wanted to be 100% adamant, yes."
12092,But even them doing that isn’t going to stop the spread 100%.
12093,It can live in frozen foods possibly.
12094,It can spread on the bottoms of your shoes.
12095,94% reduction is enough that they’re not going to be the problem any longer.
12096,"&gt;  I don't think anyone realized we'd have to live with indefinite lockdowns and terribly burdensome restrictions

How could you possibly have failed to realize that?"
12097,It was obvious from the outset that without a hard lockdown (and the US has never had anything resembling a hard lockdown) the virus would be with us at least until we got a vaccine.
12098,"&gt; until we achieved vague and changing metrics or that there'd be no clear end in sight nearly a YEAR later

It's almost as though a whole planet of disjoint jurisdictions and public officials with different priorities and reactions did their best and adjusted their responses to a new situation based on updated information and observed changes."
12099,Seriously what else were you expecting?
12100,Some all-knowing father figure to descend from the heavens to kiss our boo-boo better in a few weeks?
12101,"Obviously not, but it seems like there are a lot of people claiming that anything less is some kind of horrific failure."
12102,"We were never going to resolve this until we had some kind of medical intervention, be it prevention or cure."
12103,At the outset we were told vaccines took at least 18 months to develop and god help your karma on reddit if you suggested that maybe the situation was serious enough to warrant skipping a few steps to speed that up.
12104,So that set the reasonable timeframe to hope to see a resolution.
12105,&gt; Do you know what the end game is at this point?
12106,"Nobody knows with absolute certainty, and there's no reason why you should expect them to."
12107,The vaccines may substantially or completely resolve things in many countries within a few months.
12108,But there are plenty of ways that could go wrong even now.
12109,And if they do we'll have to adjust again.
12110,That's just the reality of learning to deal with new problems.
12111,[deleted]
12112,This.
12113,People are getting hung up on bribing medical staff instead of keeping the shots flowing.
12114,If the nurse won’t take it give it to the potential patient.
12115,None of this will matter nearly as much once a vaccine is available to the rest of Americans and covid deaths drop precipitously.
12116,Covid is very low risk for kids and there’s not a chance in hell that we keep schools closed another year or have difficult rules in place just to avoid  the low number of deaths that would prevent.
12117,Probably eastern Germany... No wonder the infections here are so bad.
12118,The vaccine roll-out is a disaster.
12119,Why is the US so bad at this stuff?
12120,Anything that involves government and private sector cooperation always becomes a clusterfuck.
12121,Why subsidize companies for things that should be normal behaviour.
12122,Tax breaks is a form of communism.
12123,"Someone elsewhere posted that they didn’t seem to have that problem with other outbreaks like AIDS and Ebola, and excess deaths don’t point to more covid either."
12124,There needs to be better messaging that you need more time after a vaccine.
12125,We just aren’t used to that in the US with any other vaccines.
12126,Because it is not the only one.
12127,What about this one?
12128,"[https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-china-54277439](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-china-54277439)

12130,Now see what happened with Jack Ma.
12131,"After all, we know what happened with Hong Kong!!"
12132,It is not like this was the first time CCP acts in this way.
12133,Where's the data?
12134,"You can't just look at infection numbers and say ""well, this must not be very effective!"""
12135,"There's a multitude of factors to look at here: human behavior, infectiousness of the new variant, etc."

12144,"It does in my small Oregon town, but this took place in Salem, cops aren’t coming."
12145,&gt; Questions over the effectiveness of the vaccine were raised amid **reports  that thousands of Israelis were still becoming sick after receiving the  vaccine.
12146,"**  
&gt;  
&gt;Israel’s coronavirus tsar has warned that a single  dose of the Pfizer/BioNtech vaccine may be providing less protection  than originally hoped, as the country reported a record 10,000 new Covid  infections on Monday."
12147,"&gt;  
&gt;In remarks reported by  Army Radio, Nachman Ash said a single dose appeared “less effective than  we had thought”, and also lower than Pfizer had suggested."
12148,"&gt;  
&gt;The new concern follows the release of data on  Monday by Israel’s health ministry recording 10,021 infections the  previous day, with a positivity rate above the 10% mark for the first  time in more than three months, suggesting widespread community  transmission."
12149,"&gt;  
&gt;The rates of infection have  undercut the sense of optimism that the Israeli prime minister, Benjamin  Netanyahu, has tried to project around Israel’s vaccination campaign,  for which he has taken credit."
12150,Any studies around carpooling?
12151,There is this new guy at the job who lives in the same village as I do but he has a hard time getting around.
12152,I would like to help him a bit just by carpooling to work but with corona I don't really feel like it is safe.
12153,Any scientific input on wether this would be safe with mouth masks on a 35min commute?
12154,I work in the industry.
12155,None of the bands I work with or the venues with are planning anything before that.
12156,"It's also not 2019 anymore, times have changed."

12159,"Everything is priced like it’s Walmart generic but still tastes good, my grocery budget can easily be 40% less getting the same stuff from aldi as from another local place."
12160,And that doesn’t even touch their charcuterie section or anything European or especially German.
12161,There’s no other store around here where I can afford prosciutto and Brie as if I were just making sandwiches
12162,I'd just wait until this weeks numbers are in to make any conclusions.

12179,"It was a poor choice for the amount of time to choose anyway, since it turned out that two weeks isn't even long enough to be able to see any change in the numbers from whatever policies you were using."
12180,"Back then we knew a lot less though, and I could see why they might have thought stopping movement for two weeks would crater the number of new cases, since it was believed that this was a long enough time that most people would clear the virus within that time."
12181,It was very poor messaging though to make people think that things were still basically normal and this was just a short-term interruption.
12182,They should've made it clear that reopening depends on meeting certain standards and that it could take a long time to reach those.
12183,&gt; Here it is 4 weeks from year 1 onwards if you're permanent staff.

12191,I've had jobs where I could only take 3 weeks in summer (so had to use 2 weeks at another time of year).
12192,And 4 weeks in a row is way better.
12193,"&gt;Questions over the effectiveness of the vaccine were raised amid reports that thousands of Israelis were still becoming sick after receiving the vaccine, although the public health services head, Sharon Alroy-Preis, said that in most cases this was because the individuals had not built up sufficient antibodies after being inoculated before being exposed to the virus."
12194,Because these companies realize it's better for them to incentivize their employees to get vaccinated thus reducing the chance for outbreaks in the store and more time missed due to being sick.
12195,Pay someone 4 hours to get vaccinated vs deal with half the staff out due to covid outbreak.

But they’re even hedging on that point!"

12280,That takes a double helix  DNA down to an RNA single helix structure.

12332,"Because I’m not extrapolating the vaccination rate from the first month of the rollout, and imo no one should be."
12333,"The first stages were always going to be the hardest—working out the kinks of distribution and storage, needing to vaccinate at many disparate sites (nursing homes and hospitals) instead of having centralized mass vaccination sites, dealing with the current administration’s failures, etc."
12334,"Much like how tests were super hard to come by back in April and are now very easy to get in most states, I’m expecting the vaccination rates to skyrocket in the coming weeks and months."
12335,"May or June may be optimistic, but I’d honestly be surprised if every adult in the US who wants one isn’t vaccinated by end of summer/start of fall."
12336,"&gt; The more I think about it, the more I think that social distancing is like artificial (and temporary) herd immunity."
12337,Did you just figure out that herd immunity is a function of social interaction?

12345,"We’ve had two vaccines approved within the past month, both of which happened during the biggest holiday season of the year."
12346,Did you expect us to get all 330 million of us done within a week?
12347,Have things been perfect?
12348,No.
12349,Will things continue to ramp up as we go?
12350,Of course they will.
12351,"To hear you tell it, the US government is sitting on 609 million doses that are rotting away and it’s just simply not the case."
12352,&gt;Serious question: what other vaccine ever has not stopped transmission of a virus (for people who mount an immune response)?
12353,A lot of them actually.
12354,"Someone already mentioned polio, but there’s also hepatitis B, rotavirus, pertussis and flu."
12355,The reason is that an intramuscular injection doesn’t do a very good job of creating a local mucosal immune response where you are likely to need it most.
12356,"I am not a doctor but, the antibodies are produced by your immune system and are in your blood stream."
12357,When the virus gets into your blood stream one way or another it is attacked there by the antibodies and white blood cells.
12358,"The virus can get into your blood stream by inhaling but also through your eyes, nose or mouth, like if you touch a surface and then touch your eyes."
12359,It is a respiratory illness but this doesn't mean the only way it gets into your body is through the lungs.
12360,That is where the symptoms typically show up.
12361,The virus has to multiply a lot in order to make you sick.
12362,If you aren't immune it multiplies before your body fights it off and you become sick.
12363,If you are immune it will be killed off before it has a chance to multiply and get you sick.

12377,"If not, what was the point of any of this?"
12378,The goalposts have moved halfway to the moon.
12379,"Mass vaccinations need to be a line in the sand, or this is never going to end."
12380,So an article written from S Africa somehow is a ploy to help Democrats?
12381,"I’m really curious, people as dumb as you, do you ever think this stuff out before posting it?"
12382,"&gt;An experimental COVID-19 vaccine from Johnson &amp; Johnson produced protective antibodies against the novel coronavirus in 90% of 805 volunteers by 29 days, and **that increased to 100%** by day 57, according to data from an ongoing mid-stage study."
12383,"Fascinating, I'd never heard that before."

12385,Surely.

12387,"I already have my vaccine guilt, don't you worry."
12388,Anybody deliberately spreading the virus so that others may get killed should be severely punished.
12389,&gt; Serious question: what other vaccine ever has not stopped transmission of a virus (for people who mount an immune response)?
12390,Rabies.
12391,"OK, completely besides the point, but technically true."
12392,"Rabies vaccine is only good to save the lives of those bitten since human to human transmission is extremely rare... Rabies vaccine also has a relatively high percentage of people dead after it, since it is  usually only given (or mostly given)  after somebody is bitten by a suspected animal and it might be too late anyway."
12393,Rabies is 100% fatal if vaccine is not given before it reached the brain though.

12409,"People were given the vaccine, nobody died that day... 100% effective."
12410,This is why I honestly been reading sources about vaccines from before 2020.
12411,We damn well know that having a vaccine prevents transmission in literally every case.
12412,From the polio one to every other one we’ve ever made.
12413,Hell I’m willing to bet that getting Covid probably keeps you protected for longer then 90 days because people who had MERs a whole back ago still had a form of immunity years later.
12414,BUT I understand the caution.
12415,"They can’t tell people that because there’s 

1."
12416,"We don’t know the true extent 
2."
12417,"May not be the case for everyone 
3."
12418,And even a 1% that don’t follow those rules and you’ll have Fox News talking stuff ruining the case for vaccines and undermining your research.
12419,So the doctors have to be overly cautious in what they say.
12420,But if the mods wants me to make a slight prediction for history sake and not a public statement.
12421,From an engineer not a doctor so don’t take this and run with it.
12422,If you had Covid like MERs you’re gonna have immunity for a while if you’re lucky part of a certain percentage (MERs was 86%).
12423,The vaccine however you’re jumping that immunity (which means lack of spread) up to to like 99%.
12424,Toss in there will portion of the population that if they get will be asymptotic (and they’ll probably be on the side of immunity right after).
12425,Basically we’re on the downhill of this virus and that it those couple points are true.
12426,The world is gonna be fine.
12427,Just wear masks and get the vaccine when it comes out in the summer and we should be good for fall.
12428,Sometimes I think that positivity is needed and not doom and gloom.

12434,"People here were going nuts, and now they don’t give a fuck."
12435,It'd get better faster if we vaccinated 80 year olds instead of 24 year olds for starters.

12448,It is designed so there is no counterfeiting.

12454,This might be a better question for /r/askscience or /r/covid19 because this could get really technical and go over our heads... but I figured I’d ask it here.
12455,How do the antibodies that neutralize SARS-CoV-2 reach the virus at the most common infection sites?
12456,"As a respiratory virus, it enter the body through our airways and reach the interior of our throat and lungs."
12457,"Although those parts of the body are “inside” us, my understanding is that they act more like exterior parts of our body."
12458,For example there’s not fluid filling up our airways or lungs.
12459,"At least, I don’t believe there is."
12460,"The virus seems to hit these “external facing cells” through droplets entering those airways, and outside of those cells is just a cavity filled with air... is that a correct assessment?"
12461,So how do our antibodies reach and neutralize the virus if this is an “outside infection?”  Do our lung cells saturate with the antibodies where you’re breathing them into the lungs and coating the interior of your lungs with them?
12462,Or is blood delivering them near the outer surface of the tissue and neutralizes the virus after it’s been able to “dig a little” into the more interior layer of cells?
12463,Every ELI5 explanation of antibodies I’ve ever seen says the virus and antibodies are floating around in fluid like either blood or something else.
12464,In this case the virus is sort of “outside” of the body so how does it work in this case?

12505,There must have been a better way.
12506,"And I was the one judging everyone for so much as seeing friends masked in summer, for eating indoors...so much judgement."
12507,But now I'm wondering: what other ways could this have happened?
12508,How could it get better?
12509,Yeah but there is a question of why the feds stayed completely out of the actual vaccine administration.
12510,"There are federal resources, national guard, military, logistics, funding that could have helped."
12511,They basically dumped the vaccine in the state governor laps and had them deal with it.
12512,Well this all looks obvious now but at the time with NYC being the first area hit in the US it was a very tough call.
12513,The idea of shutting down the streets in NYC is pretty radical.
12514,I don't disagree that it would have been a better move at the time but being first in a crisis is not easy.
12515,100% of people who get a vaccine will die at some point.
12516,😉
12517,&gt; I think the real reason was that it will be impossible to to know who was already vaccinated and who wasn't.
12518,And people who don't want to be vaccinated are also the ones who will be first to not wear masks.
12519,It's obvious that everyone has to keep wearing masks until we reach a daily new infection rate of 1.

12610,"It's being funded by the UK ($706M), Canada ($246M), Bill &amp; Melinda Gates ($156M), Saudi Arabia ($153M), Norway ($134M), Japan ($130M), EU ($117), France ($117M), and Germany ($117M)."
12611,"Yes, because in communist system, governors are supposed to look good on paper."
12612,"The same shit was in Soviet Union, the same shit was in my Poland during communist rule."
12613,There's herd immunity and then there's sterilizing immunization.
12614,Big difference.
12615,"Herd immunity is just where everyone has the ability to fight off the virus so you don't get severely sick, and bring the infection level down low enough so it's more or less not a threat."
12616,Sterilizing immunity is where your body kills it completely so you don't spread it at all.
12617,"They don't believe this is the case with these vaccines, or at least have no evidence it would be."
12618,I mean we wouldn't know better than them.
12619,"If you feel like you need it, take it."
12620,I heard it was more important not to take it before you get the vaccine.
12621,That it's fine to take it afterwards.
12622,And moderna (small data)
12623,"On mobile, but basically to summarize both Moderna and Israel had preliminary data showing that there was a reduction in transmission by up to 68%"
12624,And WHY they lie?
12625,Thought of that?
12626,We got clarification in NM.
12627,"Nearly 50% of the doses that the feds had allocated to us hadn't yet shipped, but all the trackers and everywhere were showing huge unused stockpiles...but the state didn't have them."
12628,"Trackers and feds showed 200k, we had received and on hand under 140k, and given like 110k at a run rate of 10k or more a day, so were close to running out."
12629,I imagine NY is seeing similar problems.
12630,It's probably similar to the Danish mink variant since it has the H69/V70 deletion.
12631,"I apologize for the complete lack of evidence-based answer but when my partner got her 2nd vaccine she was told that taking something like Tylenol/Advil was fine for treating the fever, but frowned upon for preemptively trying to treat symptoms (aka before the shot or before anything happened)."
12632,Again though this is just from what she was told from the person that gave her the vaccine.
12633,I don’t think it’s that drastic according to scientists.
12634,They even said they can modify the vaccine to account for the change in a month or so.
12635,But the issue is re-distributing that vaccine to everyone again
12636,"In the US, not without due process."
12637,"""Breaking the rules"" isn't a license to forcibly remove people from their homes."
12638,Florida basically did better by staying open.
12639,That's how bad Cuomo failed.
12640,He did worst than the state that did nothing.
12641,"It’s not just that impression, it’s also that people are just ready to go back to normal."
12642,Like it or not some transmission and yes even some level of deaths is going to be acceptable soon.
12643,"After most people are vaccinated you’ll start seeing concerts and large sports events, bars and nightclubs packed, etc."
12644,my bet is some states hold out longer but eventually cave in as well due to economic/voter pressure.
12645,The problem is that these store managers have no way to physically remove violaters.
12646,"They can call police to remove the person from private property, but they are usually gone by then."
12647,"Sure the police follow up with a warning / ticket and a store ban, but then the cycle starts over again with a new idiots."
12648,I'm sick of dealing with this.
12649,"Maybe I've been become too jaded by everything lately, but from the article title I thought this was going to be about a foster mom trying to get out of the obligations of taking care of the young man because of covid."
12650,Instead it's about about an absolutely heart wrenching decision that no parent ever wants to have to make.

12653,Also had to figure it out myself.
12654,Thank you for participating in the trial
12655,Can you provide a link to that?
12656,"Not challenging you, just genuinely curious."
12657,Kamala Harris got Moderna
12658,Concerts are already happening and being insured in states like Georgia and Arizona.
12659,And what exactly would someone sue for?
12660,"In 2019, if I went to a mass gathering and got sick, I'd be laughed at if I tried to press charges against the event organizer."
12661,What changed?
12662,"If you go hang out with 20,000 other people and catch a respiratory virus, it's nobody's fault but your own."
12663,This is why people dont take covid seriously.
12664,"If the politicians give out orders that they themselves dont follow, why should anyone do it?"
12665,"Nowhere is really reporting ""received"" though."
12666,"Our state (NM) reported like 238k received 101k given, but the federal tracker showed 200k distributed to NM, and we were one to two days away from running through all our supply."
12667,"But all the feds had done was print a shipping label, many of those weren't even shipped yet, but were being counted against us as-if we had them laying around."
12668,"The feds should start showing and tracking delivered to states, not what they're planning on thinking about shipping soon."
12669,But then the numbers would show a lot of states running 90+% through their supply.
12670,Because the difference of assuming one thing without proper evidence and end up being wrong is significant.
12671,This isn't guessing whether SPF-30 is enough to prevent you from getting a sunburn at the beach today.
12672,It's whether you will still be contagious and cause additional severe illness and death.
12673,But why should I suspect anything different considering half the USA still goes on with their lives like this thing doesn't even exist in the first place.

12676,The UK is one of the most pro-vaccination countries in Europe.
12677,"Their flu vaccine take-up is highest in Europe, if I recall correctly."
12678,So basically he's saying the vaccine is 50% against the new variant?
12679,Isreal's?
12680,Producing antibodies is not the same thing as preventing infection.
12681,The study you are referencing wasn't designed to assess efficacy.
12682,It wasn't in Europe at even remotely the same level.
12683,Give me a fucking break dude.
12684,"You err, you realize that medical staff are working in close proximity to each other, and to infectious patients..."
12685,Right?
12686,Them dancing together to blow off steam isn't a risk for them...
12687,"They're already all exposed to each other and worse...

""Riot for blm"" ohhh, i see, you're one of those erm, 'big brainers' okay."
12688,"Alabama may place last in the SEC for football next year too, not gonna bet money on it, but it *may* happen."
12689,I'm amazed at how little enforcement there is at the local and state level for polices like mask mandates.
12690,"My wife is a grocery store manager, and she doesn't get paid enough to throw people out of the store all day because ""my rights, no mask!"""
12691,"No one deserves to be screamed at by armed, aggressive individuals because being booted off of private property is someone how illegal."
12692,Can anyone shed light on if it’s OK to take Tylenol and Advil following a vaccine?
12693,"My pharmacist said it’s fine, but I’m seeing other local clinics tell friends and patients absolutely don’t unless you have a 101 and up fever."
12694,"I didn’t have a fever following my shot but I feel like death today, don’t know I can make it without taking something."
12695,"I would normally agree with you, but my sister who was vaccinated two weeks before me had the same rapid test turn into a dark line in 1/10th of the time."
12696,"It definitely means something, since she was further along in her vaccine process and no doubt had more antibodies."
12697,Religion is a culture of faith; science is a culture of doubt.

12699,"Expert scientists are the new priests, science is the new religion."
12700,"If you look at the article you've published (you haven't) you will see that all they base their analisys on is ""projections"" they cite from a different article, which in turn seem to make up those projections based on pretty much nothing at all."
12701,"By the way, ""projections"" were predicting more than 150k deaths in Sweden with the level of measures they applied."
12702,They're at around 9k.
12703,"Trust, but verify."
12704,I'm verifying.
12705,Data doesn't add up.
12706,"And it's not ""projections"", it's ex-post data."
12707,Can't really fake or make-pretend that.
12708,You believe in science and in the almighty experts that will save us all.
12709,Good for you.
12710,I just hope this thread will spark some doubt into the mind of someone who reads it.
12711,Even if it's just one single individual it was worth it.
12712,Wait I thought it was under control there?
12713,That would be a more drastic change.
12714,I don't think any scientists have said it's that likely.
12715,Don't get me wrong.
12716,"I'm not blind to the appeal of that argument, particularly for people who take the long view on history and why those countries are much poorer than the West and other developing countries."
12717,"But the fact of the matter is that aside from the price of vaccines and the limited nature of the supply (there are nonprofits and NGOs out there that could appeal for the money to buy vaccines for developing countries if that were the only issue), there's the bigger issue that many developing countries simply cannot deliver the kind of vaccines that are currently approved, at least not outside major urban areas."
12718,"You need servicable roads and distribution services that can handle getting the vaccines where they need to go and hospitals that have the equipment to store the vaccine doses, not to mention an electrical grid that can reliably run the refrigeration equipment and enough doctors and nurses to get those doses into patients."
12719,Good luck with all of that in a place like Haiti.
12720,"&amp;#x200B;

In the meantime, it's not just the elderly who need the vaccine."
12721,"We need to vaccinate clinical doctors and nurses, and in the United States and probably in Europe, the only people who are not elderly who are typically getting the vaccine are doctors and nurses."
12722,"As a side note, we’ve been trying a vapotherm at 100% with a nonrebreather over it lately."
12723,Is that what you meant?
12724,"It seems to buy some time, and we are short on Bipaps."
12725,Or did I misread?
12726,"To add on to this, we already have found some data stating we can ditch masks after vaccination already"
12727,"CDC's excess death (number of deaths above the expected average) page shows about 470,000 dead since Feb 1, 2020."
12728,That was about a week ago.
12729,They seem to update it about once a week.
12730,[https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nvss/vsrr/covid19/excess\_deaths.htm#dashboard](https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nvss/vsrr/covid19/excess_deaths.htm#dashboard)
12731,You use this dead guys reddit thread to start shit.
12732,Do you see how disgusting that is?
12733,It isn't really herd immunity if there is no herd.
12734,"As I said, its artificial (and temporary)."
12735,"Herd immunity as it is discussed is, seemingly, always under the assumption that life is back to normal."
12736,"There is no way any doctor would attribute this downturn in cases to possible herd immunity, even if the combination of vaccinated + infected + distance is reducing the spread dramatically LIKE what would happen if we had real herd immunity."
12737,What the fuck is California doing?
12738,"According to Bloomberg, there are only six states with a lower percentage of shots used."
12739,That's basic virus knowledge.
12740,Most mutations are random and have no effect or negative.
12741,Those species dies out.
12742,Beneficial mutations conquers the world
12743,This is the first time I’m hearing that antibodies from the vaccine are in any way different from antibodies from natural body immune system response to the virus.
12744,The whole point of the vaccine is to simulate virus to let immune system recognize it and develop corresponding antibodies.
12745,"As for this poor guy dying, I 99% sure no genetic testing of his initial and ‘subsequent’ infection was performed to identify the strain."
12746,"Except Trump was just being a racist xenophobe with he ""banned"" travel from China."
12747,"Look at how much slower he was to ""ban"" travel from Europe when things got bad there."
12748,"Look at how much travel his ""ban"" didn't actually stop."
12749,US Citizen?
12750,"Come right on in, no 14 day quarantine, no test, no nothing."
12751,"So, yes, a travel restriction that only prevents foreigners from entering the country while providing absolutely no protection against Americans returning abroad who were carrying the virus is something that he should be called a racist xenophobe for."
12752,I'd also like to note that the party line wasn't explicitly calling Trump a racist xenophobe for his China ban.
12753,It was to call him a racist xenophobe just in general while avoiding explicit criticism of the China travel restrictions.
12754,Thanks for you reply..wow what I reply!
12755,I think I will need to read through it again when I have finished work.
12756,"Thank you for you explanation, there are plenty of people on Reddit that would rather abuse than take the time to reply is such detail."
12757,You have given me more home work to do with Nocebo..I have never heard off it and look forward to investigating further thanks
12758,The flu vaccine is essentially protecting against the educated guess as to which strain is going to be circulating come flu season.
12759,"The influenza virus is markedly different from the coronavirus in that in mutates rapidly, and so much that the vaccine needs to be re-tooled every year."
12760,"This is what leads to the fluctuating efficacy rates, and why it doesn't outright stop transmissions."
12761,"It really only works when the correct strains are chosen to tailor the vaccine for, otherwise it won't do all that much."
12762,And it's because of all this that comparing the COVID vaccine to the flu vaccine is a pretty useless analog.
12763,"You know, Im not sure."
12764,I am sick and tired as well.
12765,Barely been out of the house since march.
12766,"Hopefully the current vaccines will give some protection against the e484 mutation and other variants, so severity and mortality is reduced."
12767,[deleted]
12768,"I can see the tighter restrictions going away quickly (but let’s be honest, the people who will refuse to wear a mask the second they get the vaccine are not the ones following those restrictions anyway) but public social distancing and masks in certain indoor/crowded spaces lingering for a while still."
12769,"I’m happy to continue those simple measures in public until we see the numbers of cases and deaths drop to a manageable level and stay there (it’s hard to say any amount of death is “manageable”, but I’m not sure how else to say it) or until experts say we don’t need them anymore, but I know many won’t."
12770,We coded a 43 year old yesterday.

12773,"One of the nurses stayed over from night shift to help until 11, even though she was working again that night."
12774,I walked her out because she was crying so hard she wasn’t safe.
12775,"It’s not human, and I’m not sure how many of us will be around when this is over."
12776,I think when it finally settles and people have time to think many will walk away.
12777,"Less than the deaths per capita of New Jersey, New York, Massachusetts, and Rhode Island still."
12778,Interesting.

12799,All the mental gymnastics going on as to how it's behaving differently and this is a slow-moving extinction event is just laughable.
12800,"This made the news earlier because when people heard ""tracking chip"" they went into conspiracy mode and thought this meant the government was injecting tracking devices."
12801,You are right they can't track each dose but they can track the vials or at the very least a box of vials.
12802,"To not track them would be foolish, Amazon tracks packages for the same reason, so they can find out where they are."
12803,I certainly hope they are tracking the progress of the vaccine shipments and not just loading them onto random trucks.

12811,I'm very happy with the approval of the vaccines and the scientific portion of the program getting vaccines approved quickly and safely.
12812,I am happy with the prodcution of the vaccines.
12813,I havent said a bad thing about either of those parts so don't imply that I have.
12814,I am very dissatisfied in the logistical side of the roll out.
12815,Keeping up with supply would make me happy.
12816,A sense of urgency instead shutting down vaccine sites for MLK day would make me happy.

12824,Reinfection is very rare.
12825,Being “reinfected” within a week or two?
12826,Highly unlikely.
12827,"There’s no proof of reinfection here, and honestly, the facts sort of disprove reinfection in this case."

12830,Mr. Trump made sure to make that difficult!
12831,"From the Michigan factory to Toronto it’s just about a 5 hour drive I believe, and yet our doses have to come from across the ocean because of the risk that Trump will prevent their export like he did the 3M N95s."
12832,Just can't wait until they start deleting the comments criticizing China because the mods are in bed with them.
12833,Covax was initiated and funded by rich countries in the EU.
12834,"Russia, the US and China did not participate in the international vaccine cooperation because they want to expand their hegemony by means of vaccine policies."
12835,Nobody is saying otherwise.
12836,"Right now less than 5% of the population is vaccinated, and thus still at risk."
12837,"We'll need to keep precautions like mask wearing in place until a much larger number have been vaccinated, or until we have determined to what level the vaccine reduces asymptomatic spread."
12838,"To quote the article:

&gt; ""It's not like you'll need to wear a mask for the rest of your life,"" he says."
12839,"""You need to wear your mask until we have the data, and we're trying to get the answers as fast as we can."""
12840,???
12841,Yh but every other factor is different
12842,Ehh I'd take no restrictions over half assed restrictions indefinitely.
12843,What we have here is a significant amount of the population that doesn't care any more about self isolating and is just finding other venues to socialize.
12844,"We also have no enforcement of the rules on people, only on businesses that are failing because of these ""lockdowns""."
12845,God has a plan...until they are the ones suffering.
12846,Population density is extremely high in urban East Asia.
12847,It's quite easy for a small cluster of infections to spread like wildfire (cough Tokyo cough).
12848,I personally think we will see it literally any day now.
12849,The first shot of the vaccine is reportedly about 50% effective after 10-12 days.
12850,The hospitalizations and fatalities are generally in only about 12-15% of the population.
12851,At this point probably almost everyone in the at-risk population in Israel has had at least one shot.
12852,"A few weeks after that, illnesses in that group should fall 90%+ which is 80-90% of overall illnesses."

12859,"They haven't ""done better""."
12860,They have fewer reported deaths because they have a younger population and because many people die without Covid tests.
12861,"We all know the deaths have been linked, but the media does not want to cover it."
12862,Plenty of states are allowing 20-40 year olds in the current pool.
12863,"In the most extreme NJ is allowing anyone who claims to be a smoker, even if they are 21 and have barely smoked."
12864,Many states also allow for people with other health conditions even if those health conditions only moderately increase risk.
12865,"Age is by far the biggest predictor, yes there may be some 20-50 year olds with particular conditions that make them truly high risk but the risk to the average 64 year old is 20-25 times that of a 20-30 year old."
12866,A mild increase in the 20-30 year olds risk due to some condition is almost never increasing their risk 25 times.
12867,These young people are better at dealing with the cumbersome scheduling websites so they are to some extent crowding out the 70-90 year olds who are less able to check the site 5 times a day.

Let's revisit convincing people after those 120 million have gotten the vaccine"
12913,What are you trying to say?
12914,They man in the picture is a modi supporter so the they hate him for that.
12915,Why would they delete the post?
12916,Well the end in this case would have to just be people going back to their normal lives even if vaccines are not effective - as most Americans are already doing.
12917,Do you people in this sub seriously expect people to live like this forever?
12918,"So fire the nurses who declined, problem solved."

12926,The benefits are farrrrrrrrr out weighed by the cost.
12927,Even if you completely ignored the health benefits the economic benefits from returned economic activity would say use whatever vaccine you have now.
12928,Pfizer changed their tune recently.
12929,The NY governor also said he wouldn't accept the Trump vaccine and delayed the rollout so he could do his own review
12930,They are.

12941,Here's that lovely Western ideology at work.
12942,We only care about other people and the world until it inconveniences us.
12943,We are the only ones that matter.
12944,All of our goodwill is just self-gratifying bullshit.
12945,It's only there so we can feel better about having exploited the rest of the world.
12946,So we can tell ourselves that we're the good guys.
12947,It's not the selfishness that disgusts me.
12948,It's the hypocrisy.
12949,You people will still delude yourselves with whatever bullshit justifications you can think of.
12950,"You'll never admit that the most important thing to your lives isn't freedom, justice, or equality, but comfort."
12951,"And then when this is over, you'll look out to the rest of the world that can't afford even a fraction of the comforts or liberties you have and say ""how could they value freedom/justice/equality so little"", still believing you're some champion of good."
12952,Why should I?
12953,Israel just proved that Pfizer recipients cannot spread the virus.
12954,[deleted]
12955,"Most of us still had time even when it had spread to Italy, and we were still just going ""oh how terrible for those poor souls in other countries, not a problem here though""."

12957,have fun!
12958,&gt; Six San Diego health care workers had allergic reactions to vaccines they  received at a mass vaccination center on Jan. 14.
12959,The site was  temporarily closed and is now using other vaccines
12960,Then why is the UK not advised to do that??
12961,We are told again and again these they offer limited protection and distancing is by far the most important measure.
12962,"And I, like many do not think that children (or students of any age) should have to sit wearing a mask all through lessons for limited benefit."
12963,Not all risk can be eliminated and sometimes the pros do not outweigh the cons.
12964,Are you counting collateral deaths such as suicides and overdoses that went up I’m during the pandemic as covid?
12965,there needs to be a snappy expression to describe these nose waggers - it's such a common occurrence.
12966,something witty - anyone have anything?
12967,Is strongly urge Biden to reconsider.
12968,Or at least open it up for essential businesses and relationships (e.g.
12969,\#loveisnottourism).
12970,"I say this as someone who has been diligent about wearing masks to even answer the door, only leaving the house every few weeks for supplies, etc."
12971,CDC and WHO have both recommended testing over travel bans.
12972,"It not only promotes more testing (more data is better), but it's been proven that the bans don't help much in the first place."
12973,"Believe it or not, not all of us travel for leisure."
12974,It's important to listen to the scientists and choose logic over politics.
12975,In my opinion Trump is trolling Biden with this and he's taking the bait.
12976,"But, if you're going to do it then just lock everything down but the absolute essentials for a few weeks and get it over with."

12982,Even though it prevents most disease and reduces severity if you do get sick?That’s zero benefit?
12983,"Well if I’m honest, I mostly did it so I could gave confidence to my slightly vaccine-skeptic mom and a few friends with a lot of questions."
12984,What better way to know than to actually be part of it?
12985,"From what I understand, the mRNA vaccines that Pfizer and Moderna produced are built on  potentially game-changing technology and we might be able to quickly make vaccines for any pandemic or epidemic in the future."
12986,"Yeah, whenever anybody on Reddit (or anywhere) is absolutely obnoxiously sure of something, you can be sure they don't know jack, and only possess the unbearable compulsion to shut down information that doesn't align with their worldview."
12987,"And/or to dominate, however they can."
12988,They can't separate their thoughts from their emotions and miss their learning moment.

12992,"Yeah, I think every local community leader should make a big presentation of getting it once available."
12993,"The biggest problem is it needs to be distanced, without food, and probably on ""the TV""."
12994,"I guess, but it's still good to see the desired results being replicated through public administration of the vaccine rather than just in a controlled trial."
12995,"This can help strengthen public confidence in the vaccine, while also reducing the likelihood that anything about the design of the trials or the selection of the participants accounted for their results rather than the strength of the vaccine itself."
12996,That's not what the decision of that infamous cake case was about.
12997,The Supreme Court didn't issue an opinion whatsoever on whether a business could deny servies to people on the grounds of religious beliefs.
12998,"When people say the baker ""won"" that case, it was the Court agreeing that the Colorado Civil Rights Commission wasn't being neutral in their pursuit against the baker, not that the baker could refuse to make a cake."
12999,Imagine how many had it early on and we’re never tested.
13000,Grandma's and grandpa's what?
13001,The rollout is slow already.
13002,That would slow it down more.
13003,Plus eventually they want everyone to get it and that could cause confusion.
13004,[deleted]
13005,"&gt; Not only are those vague estimates from the CDC (which has constantly failed to literally do anything during the whole pandemic and has been beyond useless, I do not trust their word at all anymore),

This is the much bigger, and so far untold story that will come out of the pandemic."
13006,"The public's trust in not just government overall, but public health orders has been completely eroded due to the massive amounts of misinformation peddled by the Trump administration."
13007,Thinking a competent administration can quickly rebuild this trust would be misguided.
13008,"Honestly, not to be political but now that the end of this administration is upon us I can't believe how quickly incompetence mixed with a dose of malice can destroy the institutions keeping a country afloat."
13009,"And yes, I'm from the US where we've watched this happen throughout the world our whole lives but never here."
13010,"So yes, I'm definitely a little naïve on the whole topic."
13011,"Ours is hardwired, I’m pretty sure moving it would be a violation of the lease agreement and possibly insurance"
13012,Quit your BS.
13013,Nothing in that quote says they spread it or get sick outside the 5.9%
13014,"If the US Government offered $50 for people to get vaccinated, it would probably save them from paying far more in stimulus packages."
13015,I mean he's kinda right.
13016,If Wyoming or Kansas or whatever can't get their vaccines distributed it would be very silly to prevent other states from taking the doses if they could get more Americans vaccinated.
13017,I don't know that there's evidence of that situation actually occuring though.
13018,We’re definitely living through history here.
13019,These vaccines are the best achievement we’ve had in decades.
13020,Why are we not doing antibody test to see who needs the vaccine?
13021,Surely a good percentage do not need it.. -  Is it because its cheaper to just give the vaccine even if some don't need it?
13022,"&gt; “There’s going to be a lot of intense demand even in younger cohorts,  but I think once we get to 100 million, maybe 120 million vaccines, the  demand is going to get soft,” Gottlieb said, basing his forecast on the  number of U.S. **adults who received a flu shot** this past year."
13023,I don't think this assumption is valid.
13024,The flu doesn't stop millions of people from seeing their loved ones and travelling the world.
13025,Also the flu vaccine(s) are not close to the efficacy of mRNA vaccines for COVID and people are keen to a) protect themselves and b) get back to normal life.
13026,"For those who are cautious about getting a COVID vaccine (rather than the completely antivaxx), they will be reassured when their family, friends, neighbours, co-workers, etc."
13027,get their shots.
13028,Even some antivaxxers will come around when they embrace the self-preservation aspect.

13034,"The antibodies produced by B cells in severe cases are neutralizing, though."
13035,The virus may infect macrophages directly as there's evidence that they express ACE2.
13036,"On the ADE side of things, what may be happening is antibodies that are directed against ACE2 itself, basically caught up in a complex with S1."
13037,"There are autoantibodies that are generated in severe COVID-19 due to hyperinflammation, though."
13038,"So, we may not be seeing ADE, but rather autoimmunity."
13039,"For instance, autoantibodies against phospholipid associated proteins leading to antiphospholipid syndrome which results in clots."
13040,"Those are valid points, but it still doesn’t give you the right to be a dick."
13041,"Damn, reading this makes me feel like I caught Covid again a couple of weeks ago"
13042,It is an issue if the vaccinations are slow since people can get reinfected.
13043,"It also means we mist vaccinates those who already had it despite them having a great immunity against the normal strains - which is a shame, since not vaccinating them right away would save vaccines."
13044,Go job-shadow a coroner and report back.
13045,"Yeah, I'll keep my skepticism high on this one."
13046,"They praised the first one too, then Putin refused to take the shot, it came with restrictions regarding the age, etc."
13047,There's nothing magical about crossing an international border vs a non-international border that makes the virus spread more.
13048,"What you're proposing would have been a Europe wide shelter in place order which is what experts, including from the WHO, were saying was needed from the beginning."
13049,Smart move.
13050,Israel would probably use poison.

13057,[deleted]
13058,We don't know that it died out.
13059,Overall hospitalizations peaked last week and ICU admissions are highly correlated to those.
13060,"We are truly over the ""hump"" - at least in the sense of an absolute peak."
13061,We're still at shockingly elevated levels of hospitalizations and cases overall but the trajectory down is pretty clear from here.
13062,At least on a nation-wide basis we've gotten through the worst (with the asterisk that some individual states may still have the worst to come).
13063,"Even deaths have started to turn the corner, although they'll be the last to show a sustained decline given that they lag cases and hospitalizations."
13064,"I agree... a lot of chatter among the medical &amp; scientific community that past infection may not provide immunity to new variants, yet folks in this thread are assuming herd immunity..."
13065,I strongly condemn everyone that went against the strong consensus of experts.
13066,Cuomo being in a crowd of idiots doesn't excuse his decisions.
13067,London's in lockdown I have no idea what's parked near downing street.

13083,"What happens if things are worst in terms of # of cases, even with X amount of people vaccinated?"
13084,"Fuck it, stick to the plan?"
13085,The choice isn't lockdowns forever vs 5% increase in mortality.
13086,It's lockdowns for a few more months vs increase in mortality + increase in # of cases thus leading to overwhelmed hospitals.
13087,"The fallout from this is much greater than 400,000 people dead from COVID."
13088,"Edit: Realistically, in March of last year if we locked down and set a deadline if would not have been more than 6 months away."
13089,Check back in in September and our #'s would have sucked.
13090,"I suppose you could argue if we set a hard deadline for a lockdown then people may have actually tried harder, and we would have enforced it much more...but I doubt it."

13096,Humanity developed a vaccine in record-smashing time using relatively new technology and got an efficacy that other vaccines with decades of development have not and will not ever see.

13101,"Just think : somewhere in history, enough people were thrown through windows that we had to create a word for it."
13102,I believe average time from positive test to death is 16 days?
13103,"So even if people re-isolated starting Jan 2, a lot of deaths in early Feb are already baked in."
13104,Sure if we pulled a severe Lockdown starting yesterday deaths might start to fall mid February.
13105,Gains from the vaccine and from returning to non holiday activities will be small and slow growing.
13106,"And likely 500,000 deaths by Feb according to the incoming CDC head Dr. Rochelle Walensky."
13107,Hey that’s awesome!
13108,"I have a strong suspicion that I received the placebo, but we’ll see what happens!"
13109,"It feels a bit weird to me for us to be “jumping the line”, but That’s their way of saying “thank you” I suppose."
13110,"In addition to giving them more people to study, since I was told we would start the whole phase 3 process over if we had the placebo originally and choose to be vaccinated."
13111,"It's also good PR, i'd rather go to a store that encourages their workers to get vaccinated than one that doesn't."
13112,Haha I just linked someone to that in the discussion thread
13113,It’s an optional section
13114,I think you do not understand the argument made
13115,"I think the recommendation to eat healthy, make your own meals and eat as much fresh produce as possible is a universal advice regardless of the ongoing pandemic - just like having an active lifestyle and limiting harmful substances as much as possible."
13116,"And since there is no direct evidence yet of foodborne transmission being an urgent issue (unlike airborne and fomite/surface transmission), it might be overkill to make a big fuss specifically about this."
13117,"I mean, we're already constantly bombarded, almost to the point of oversaturation, with health and safety information as is, so piling even more on top of that may actually be counter-productive."
13118,"I'd say it's a case of ""pick your battles"" from a public health point of view, a focus on the issues and information that are most urgent and that can make the biggest difference."

13121,What if they’re concerned about the safety of the vaccine?
13122,I think it’s pretty reasonable to be concerned about potential side effects from a vaccine that was developed in under a year..

13130,Paid time off for sickness or doctors appointments in the US differs greatly than in Europe.
13131,"I believe that is why they are adding this, it’s to stop people from not getting the jab because it will impact their take home pay."
13132,Maybe it’s because a large chunk of Americans need to be bribed or incentivized to do the right thing and most of the rest of the world actually just does it.
13133,How long would it take the EU to vaccinate 70% of its population at the current rate?
13134,Millions of people won't vaccinate because of this story.
13135,The part that made people question I'm guessing is that you said you were 24 and your career was stopped dead in its tracks.
13136,Which implies that you arent in the health care field.
13137,"I'm not judging, just explaining."
13138,This is a frequent concern with vaccines and one of the primary reasons they take long to test.
13139,One recently approved vaccine that may cause ADE is the [Dengue Virus Vaccine](https://www.cdc.gov/dengue/prevention/dengue-vaccine.html).
13140,"&gt; The vaccine manufacturer, Sanofi Pasteur, announced in 2017 that people who receive the vaccine and have not been previously infected with a dengue virus may be at risk of **developing severe dengue if they get dengue after being vaccinated**."
13141,I am a med student.
13142,[deleted]
13143,There's no vaccine with well-reviewed data that is suitable for much of the developing world.
13144,Maintaining the chain of refrigeration for the Pfizer vaccine would be impossible and doing it for the Moderna vaccine would also be extremely difficult or impossible.
13145,The Sinovac vaccine (the Chinese government backed vaccine) has disappointing data with only 50% efficacy in ongoing large trials.
13146,"Certainly better than nothing, but still not as good as the Pfizer or Moderna vaccines."
13147,"Russia claims the sputnik 5 vaccine is 91% effective, but I'm skeptical because they've only given 1.5M doses despite it being the first vaccine to start being administered worldwide."
13148,Either they are having massive manufacturing issues or it's lack of efficacy means they don't want to do a massive a vaccination campaign.
13149,The Oxford/Astrazeneca's vaccine is probably the first that will be available to poorer countries.
13150,"J&amp;Js vaccine has high efficacy in young and middle aged adults, but glaringly has not released data on the over 65 population yet."
13151,One of them became one of the best Presidents (FDR).
13152,Displaying my ignorance: the only hit I got for TDR is a department of the TX government.

13157,Genuine question... What is a better system?
13158,Mask wearing isn’t “stringent” I was in Ghana/Togo in early October that’s a false romanticised notion.
13159,All of it?
13160,In secret?
13161,He announced he’s going to try and buy directly from Pfizer instead of the federal govt because they only sent us 53k for this entire week.

13173,"But I'm not even discussing the long bureaucratic procedures, because none of us knows what's the period of time the required testing would need."
13174,"These vaccines have our body produce new proteins, and it's been proven to be safe for this spike protein."
13175,I doubt they would wing it for a new type protein without testing.
13176,"Even if needs 3 months, it's a long time."

13182,"If and when errors are identified, there is an erratum process for official corrections."
13183,"Typically, for what it's worth, any remotely reputable media outlet knows that these numbers are either already available or will become imminently available and that there's not much point to fabricating them."

13196,The money spend on covid bailouts in the west could have “cured” malaria TB and child malnutrition or infant mortality.
13197,"Last time I checked 10,000 children die in the African continent every week from a preventable disease."
13198,If you want to be utilitarian then maybe the Trillion in bailout could have been spent there.
13199,"Find a good news tag and stick to those, they always fill me with positivity."
13200,The point is we don't have enough data.
13201,The vaccine will protect the person that has it but they don't know if it'll prevent them from spreading it to others.
13202,This will of course be a concern to parents since kids won't be getting the vaccine.
13203,[removed]
13204,"A shot’s a shot, man."
13205,The more people the better.
13206,"I thought it was 6, where are you seeing 10?"
13207,That 94% reduction is substantial.
13208,"if 10% of the vaccinated population previously had covid, a 94% reduction lowers it down to 0.6%."
13209,It's not like the vaccine does nothing to prevent infection or spread.
13210,I’ve already had covid and I didn’t have any symptoms
13211,That's why we have Apple phones.
13212,Communication and a tasty snack in one package.
13213,"Well interestingly, 1/3 of the country is obese (and if I were I'd rush and get it too), 1/3 are overweight so perhaps will get it when it's possible and clear there are no immediate risks and 1/3 who are neither obese nor overweight and might want to see what happens long term with a completely new scientific advancement."
13214,I see you post in /r/conservative.
13215,You are proving my point.
13216,Really admire them for conducting their own study.
13217,"The more data, the better."
13218,"Ok, some facts."
13219,There are at Lear 4 different types of COVID vaccines currently registered.
13220,mRNA is just one of these four and the science of the long term effectiveness of one type vaccine over another or of the vaccine vs natural immune response to the virus is unavailable.
13221,"We know next to nothing about Covid at this point, so statements like this are nothing more but a speculation."
13222,At the end what matters is if the immune system will recognize subsequent infection and can quickly produce necessary hormones and antibodies that can stop kill infected cells
13223,"74 million in Africa are 65 or older, they're still as vulnerable and should be taken care of."
13224,It won't take much doses from the rest of the world.
13225,"3 new strains this month is then news fear mongering, here is [U.K.](report) showing how their new strain has 23 different mutations and that is just one of 12 common strains in the U.K. only the U.K. does genomic sequencing on a national level so it is the only evidence, there was earlier evidence out of Turkey but it is getting old now"
13226,This really highlights the importance of nursing home caregivers getting vaccinated.
13227,Some elderly are too frail to even handle a vaccine no less covid.
13228,[removed]
13229,They fought back unlike the countries that fail and give money to billionaires
13230,So $29.
13231,Got it.
13232,Because the virus moves in waves no matter what restrictions you have.
13233,Here in Minnesota we shut down restaurants in November but our cases and hospitalizations still followed the same curve as Wisconsin which didn’t shut anything down.
13234,"Contrary to what this sub would have you believe, Florida is not a cesspool of covid and is around 25th in deaths and cases per 1M out of all US states."
13235,I hope the family gets over this and will be well.
13236,And thank the wonderful and talented people who developed and worked on the vaccine - God Bless them.
13237,"I'm a Nudist and I hate clothes, but I still have to get dressed whenever I go out in public -- that's just standard operating procedure."
13238,So slapping a mask on to protect myself and my family is simple and easy-peasy.
13239,"I think ""those"" people just like confrontation, it's like they think they have some sort of power."
13240,If I can't lick doorknobs again by the end of the year I will fucking riot.
13241,They're not swimming in covid like the surrender nations

13243,"So by the looks of this study, RNA vaccinations while some reports of side effects are coming in, the results seem to drastically overwhelm the negatives."

13268,"Enough genetic change eventually may require tweaking the vaccine formula, but “it’s probably going to be on the order of years if we use the vaccine well rather than months,” Dr. Andrew Pavia of the University of Utah said Thursday on a webcast hosted by the Infectious Diseases Society of America."

13275,I'll see for myself.
13276,Afaik COVID is more widespread in rich countries rather than poor countries?
13277,Me too.
13278,"I never prior to Covid fully appreciated just how deep the chasm is between humans who fear death, and humans who don’t (or at least fear it LESS than other things)."
13279,"I don’t know if we will ever be able to understand each other after this, but it explains a TON of what has gone on this past year..."
13280,&gt; Current indications are that up to 30% of patients continue to have  significant problems that intrude on daily life two to three weeks after  testing positive.
13281,Perhaps as many as 10% are still afflicted three to  six months later
13282,"94% reduction, Goober."
13283,94%.
13284,Your source stated it.
13285,[removed]
13286,Israel is in lockdown since the 26.12 and now the government wants to increase it for another 2 weeks till the 5.2.
13287,"But most of the daily 8K-10K new cases located at small amount of cities in which the government don’t try to enforce, cities where everyone doing mass events and gatherings,

The big cities like TLV, Haifa, beer Sheva etc gets only 5%-7% confirmed cases from all the tests
While cities like Jerusalem and Bnei brak get 20% (1 of every 86 is confirmed) 

Cities where people go we the rules are fine even with the first dose of the vaccine, while cities without enforcement getting increased numbers of new cases and no one tries to do anything about that, they doing “collective punishment” on all the citizens without going to enforce the main source of it, in this rate the lockdown will never end."
13288,"We could be out of this lockdown for weeks but the government doesn’t care, they don’t try to enforce the cities with the cases, everything there is like normal, the vaccines won’t going to help if they can’t even control the contaminated cities, 

The link is the number of cities with % of the cases"
13289,"Yeah well, I'll need a source for that then - I just find strange that having our cells produce new proteins goes on without any testing."
13290,"Uh, and it's not fear mongering."
13291,So please share the info where it wouldn't require any trials.
13292,My GF had the same experience onset 7 days after injection after getting it at a kroger.
13293,Her doctor prescribed antibiotics for potential infection but said it was more likely just a rare side effect.
13294,[deleted]
13295,"That does not sound good, I've been hearing a few reports out of Brazil about it but many of the European experts were saying the vaccines would still be able to fight against it (but would be less effective)."

13300,I don’t think I’ll have to wait two years either I think that’s when it automatically unblinds.
13301,I’m pretty sure I can request to be unblinded if I need to be.
13302,Mine was directly through the local office conducting the trial.

13307,So it turns out I did not recall correctly...
13308,Thanks for clearing that up!
13309,I’m very afraid of getting it again.
13310,I was super sick in early March.
13311,"My wife was mildly ill. She now has the vaccine (both doses), I’m just waiting for my turn."

13317,Oh absolutely.
13318,"Maybe I should mentioned that, but I didn't think it was relevant."
13319,"Or rather, it's so obvious that it didn't need mention."
13320,"Not just obese, but I am pretty sure the average age of death is higher than the life expectancy in the US."
13321,It seems like resources could have been used to ensure these people were not exposed to the virus than institute ad hoc and arbitrary measures across all groups.
13322,The only people I know on salary are the store managers.
13323,The assistants don't make salary.
13324,Assistants make 20$ an hour.
13325,Get paid for overtime too at least where I'm at.
13326,Feeling personally safe from covid is always going to be a more powerful influence on individual behavior than containing spread for its own sake.
13327,Multiple hospitals in major cities were pushed against or past their capacity limits this month and we did not any major behavioral shifts like we saw in March when the goal was ostensibly to ‘flatten the curve’.
13328,"Having a mask at handy on your person even after widespread vaccination is probably a reasonable expectation - but voluntarily continuing to live life like it’s 2020 is going to be out of the question for most people, even the ones who were the most committed to being careful and cautions from the beginning."
13329,"&gt; Dover said that she has a medical condition where she often faints when she feels pain  

Too late."
13330,The anti-vaccine propaganda flooded the internet with that footage claiming she fainted or even died because the vaccine is lethal or not enough tested.

13343,What about everyone else voluntarily getting it?
13344,Can we stop comparing this virus to wars or natural disasters or terrorist attacks?
13345,They are really bad comparisons.
13346,"Fuck that, as a college grad it’s a life saver."
13347,"I don't have the link ready, but supposedly vaccinations were halted in San Diego due to an alarming number of allergic reactions."
13348,Not sure if that has something to do with it.
13349,I agree with you.
13350,I’m hopeful that there will soon be an agreement between countries to limit international travel almost entirely.
13351,Hopefully then we could keep covid mutations from spreading around the globe and countries that do well won’t have issues with those countries who are problematic.
13352,does anyone have any insight on israel’s numbers?
13353,"I had heard they’d be one to watch given how fast they’re rolling out the vaccine, with ~27% vaccinated right now."

13420,Seems like a good idea to have influential politicians and sportsmen  setting an example for their communities.
13421,Agree.
13422,I think that Fauci and the rest are being very PC (and optimistic) by aiming for a full re-opening once herd immunity has been achieved which is something that might not happen this year (or the next one).
13423,The reality is that some groups of people will simply not accept to be vaccinated which will delay herd immunity but they're not our problem.
13424,IMO the most sensible time to fully reopen is when the vaccine is available to all regardless if herd immunity has been reached.
13425,"There's no way we can keep bailing out massive swaths of the economy that long, nor will people comply when a massive chunk are vaccinated."
13426,Is it?
13427,Or is it something cultural (within the fire department or their at home culture) and a mistrust that comes from years of being mistreated by health care?

13452,Yes but at number three Florida is still only half the population of California.
13453,"On top of that, one county in California is 25% of the total population (Los Angeles County)."
13454,Miami-Dade County is the most populous in Florida at 2.6 million vs 10 million in LA County.
13455,So take my previous analogy and make it counting 26 people vs 100 people.
13456,It’s still going to be more difficult to ramp up the scale of distribution to a larger population just like counting the eye color of 26 people vs 100 people would be.
13457,It’s going to take longer even if you have the same proportion of “counters”.
13458,"That being said, once you get your systems worked out, the larger county’s throughput will probably scale to outmatch the other in time."

13488,The study period was from May to November 15 in 22 states.
13489,"In May U.S was averaging ~20K cases per day, in November it had risen to ~150k cases per day."
13490,"Obviously if the cases increase so much per day, more children will also be infected."
13491,"Funnily enough, going from 20K to 150K cases per day is an increase of 750%."
13492,"In the study it says: 

&gt; ""At the beginning of the study, the average cumulative hospitalization rate per 100 000 children was 2.0, increasing to 17.2 by the end of the study,"" 

Which is 760% increase as written in the table."

13675,I feel like I’ve heard that line every couple of days since March.
13676,Do they have to run insurance fore very vaccination they perform?
13677,Kinda fucked that not being able to get the vaccine means you’re a slave
13678,"Actually, that's also not true (sorry to be the ""akshully"" lady)."
13679,"But because so many of their elderly have been infected, they do have very high percentages of (presumed) immunity."
13680,It's believed that the main reason older haredi are getting vaccinated at lower rates is because of the sky high infection rate earlier in the pandemic among that same population.
13681,Needs to switch to first come first serve.
13682,The over 65 and frontline works are just slowing the whole process down.
13683,"While it does suck, Aldi is one of the top payers for a retail store."

13685,I think the people were extremely elderly and ill. My dad is 72 with pre-existing conditions and is 100% getting the vaccine.
13686,Its possible she'll get bad side effects so maybe make a plan if she starts feeling bad and how you'll bring her food and supplies and check in on her.
13687,After my mom got it I made her text me and confirm she was ok every night for a few days (I'm her emergency contact).
13688,Maybe she can get on a virtual call to consult with her doctor?
13689,Or my insurance company offers virtual calls with their list of doctors?
13690,And she could review it
13691,The lack of variety is how they keep the prices low.
13692,Thank you for the clarification!
13693,That makes sense!
13694,The US is vaccinating at twice the rate of Aldi's home country Germany.
13695,"Man, it's tough though."
13696,"I live right outside NYC - almost all of my social life was hanging out with family or going into the city and just doing whatever, spontaneously."

13702,"People gave me odd looks, but I did not care."
13703,"From your source:

&gt; To qualify for the executive employee exemption, all of the following tests must be met:

 &gt; • The employee must be compensated on a salary basis (as defined in the regulations) at a rate not less than $684* per week;

&gt; • The employee’s primary duty must be managing the enterprise, or managing a customarily recognized department or subdivision of the enterprise;

&gt; • The employee must customarily and regularly direct the work of at least two or more other full-time employees or their equivalent; and

&gt; • The employee must have the authority to hire or fire other employees, or the employee’s suggestions and recommendations as to the hiring, firing, advancement, promotion or any other change of status of other employees must be given particular weight."
13704,You seriously don’t think their job qualifies as exempt?
13705,"As they said, she’s an assistant manager so she’s likely managing two or more employees, managing a subdivision of her location, and her suggestions for firing and hiring are almost certainly given weight."
13706,It’s a pretty low bar.
13707,"Seems like it would bring the western hemisphere, Europe, Australia, New Zealand, Japan, and South Korea up to the level of China."
13708,Worst case scenario is no different than the status quo.
13709,"There was pretty good reason why we didn't 

&gt; Why didn't the FDA demand information on infectivity before authorizing the first two vaccines?"
13710,&gt; Adding in even more coronavirus tests along the way to see if the vaccinated volunteers had picked up or were transmitting the virus would have delayed the initial results considerably

13730,It's been at the back of my mind since I read it months and months ago.
13731,"This is like the perfect example of why the marketing works lol, you can't tell me you actually would taste a difference in blind tests."
13732,Any Covid vaccine study will be pressured to unblind.
13733,It will be asked about when they apply for EUA.
13734,There’s real sensitivity on this due to the re-awareness of the Tuskegee study as Covid disproportionately is fatal or more severe for POC.
13735,Any manufacturer who won’t unblind and tell participants their status will face a helluva PR problem.
13736,This in addition to the ethical issue of risk of illness that scoutmom wrote.
13737,All teaching hospitals / health science centers have some sort of Committee for the Protection of Human subjects and they too don’t want blowback for placing patients at risk.
13738,"The consent forms (I’m on Janssen/ J&amp;J w/ Tulane as the partner institution &amp; my hubs is on Pfizer w/Oschner as partner institution, we are in New Orleans too) are pretty similar."
13739,"But as trial participation is  voluntary, the partner institution needs to keep folks in the study so they need to play nice."
13740,That means unblinding upon request and providing vaccines for those who got the saline shot as a priority.
13741,FWIW hubs shots were Aug &amp; Sept and we guessed (turned out correctly) that he got the real stuff as distinctive side effects 2.5 days.
13742,He got an email first week Jan stating that at his next blood draw visit in Feb he would be unblinded IF he wanted to know and that he needed to respond to the email as to this specifically.
13743,He emailed back yes.
13744,3 days later he got a phone call from study staff that yes he got the vaccine and a reminder about his next visit in Feb. then last week got another email asking verification of address as they are sending out a Covid vaccination completed card.
13745,And today an email reminder about the Feb visit.
13746,"This is all about keeping the participants feeling good about staying in the trial, going to appt, getting blood draws and doing reports each week."
13747,The $ is too low for this to be the reason to be in it.
13748,"At my 2nd Janssen visit this month, I was told that either by mid Feb or end of Feb there should be enough data for a Janssen to submit EUA &amp; if done then we are unblinded and offered real vaccine as a priority patient."
13749,My Feb visit is right after nonMardi Gras so I’m hopeful that I’ll be unblinded at the at visit.
13750,Going to a doctor or dentist appointment?
13751,Unexpected caring responsibility (child or parent) would be similar situations.
13752,We are going for 3rd option.

Also, J&amp;J is not a safe bet for an investment, you clearly have a position there and I would suggest you think long and hard about the likely hood that their 1 shot vaccine does not provide effective enough protection compared to Pfizer and Moderna and J&amp;J loses yet another opportunity to make up for their talc-contamination travesty."

14048,"It's you saying ""we need to believe the scientists"" and me saying ""stuff doesn't add up though, let's check"""
14049,It means that schools will still be open because kids are not contagious ?
14050,Well judging by the comments this will be locked in 10 minutes lol
14051,"The consent form and study protocol I read said they may unblind participants, but it's not a guarantee."
14052,"Given that we want to get pregnant, I wanted to be sure they would tell me."
14053,"When I asked specifically about our situation and pregnancy, the study recruiter told me in no uncertain terms no, they wouldn't tell me but they would want me to keep them updated about the outcomes of my pregnancy.."
14054,So that was a hard pass for me.
14055,"It won't hurt, there is usually some flu activity in late February, although less than usual this year probably."

14081,Couple this with the vaccinations of the elderly and vulnerable and there will be no reason not to open up society again.
14082,"It's not like they are making a crazy amount of tax off of people being out of work, they are heavily incentivised to reopen at the earliest possible time."
14083,Ugh these articles and public health experts need to just be fucking honest and say what they're all thinking.
14084,People will see vaccinated people not wearing masks and stop wearing masks or lie about being vaccinated and be a colossal ass.

14153,Awful 10 months.
14154,"There is something like that, some report I'm half remembering, where kids given Tylenol didn't develop the same immune response when given with a vaccine (obviously not a covid vaccine)."

14171,You asked how it could be better.
14172,I'm telling you.
14173,If governments went with an aged based vaccination system.
14174,That would be one way to make things better faster.
14175,"It's not your fault they didn't, but it is a fact."
14176,"either BioNTech vaccine or BioNTech/Pfizer vaccine, just Pfizer vaccine is totally wrong."
14177,"but anglo-media won't change that and they did well, considering everyone calls it the ""Pfizer vaccine"""
14178,I **may** win the lottery this week.
14179,"X to doubt, but you know, I **may**, so probably worthy of a headline."
14180,It's unclear if having an infection in the past produces the same immune response as having the vaccine.
14181,So we can't just conclude someone being previously infected is automatically immune.
14182,Also it's just a mask dude.
14183,Stop complaining and just wear it.
14184,I have no issue with you getting vaccinated.
14185,It's everyone's right to get vaccinated when the rules allow.
14186,"I have a problem with states that don't follow the science, that make political choices in who gets vaccinated."

14191,So here we are.
14192,Propaganda???
14193,wake up
14194,"Yes, I know two people who were unblinded a couple weeks ago, and the one who got placebo was given the vaccine a couple days later."
14195,It's not like J&amp;J has a lot of vaccines just waiting.
14196,They will take time to ramp up production just like everyone else.
14197,If they ignore it and claim it as a hoax long enough it'll go away.
14198,After many years and an insane amount of deaths they might be right too.

14209,Nope.

14231,Unblinding means that participants will be officially notified if they received the vaccine in the clinical trial or a placebo shot.
14232,"When that information is presented, the person in the trial will have the chance to get the vaccine if they were part of the placebo group in order to give them protection from the virus."
14233,"Typically, the information on what participant gets what shot is ""hidden"" from everyone unless a participant gets sick, at which time the test evaluators can determine what that specific person has."
14234,It's how they discover the efficacy of the vaccine.
14235,The vaccine disbursement is something the state (county?)

14243,Reduction in response?
14244,Okay?
14245,How much?
14246,At what percentage were antibodies reactive?
14247,To what percent were they reactive?
14248,So 50% were cleared of re infections and 90% only had a “reduced” response.
14249,Sorry that isn’t enough for me.
14250,I need peer reviewed studies to confirm ANY numbers before anyone can say anything.
14251,It’s fear mongering.
14252,I wonder if its legal to give a raise to the vaccinated.
14253,I'm sure you do ;)
14254,The fact that no hospital system in China outside of Hubei got overwhelmed is proof positive that China acted extraordinarily early.
14255,They managed to catch the virus at the point when it was still containable and gave the world a blueprint for how to return a country back to normal given even a severe local outbreak.
14256,Other countries simply waited until their outbreaks were no longer containable and then started whining about why China didn't warn them!
14257,Yup.
14258,And I’m not volunteering to wait at the back of the line when there were 70M Americans that voted (again!)
14259,for the guy that *completely* botched our Covid response.

14265,!
14266,"Not only that, it’s completely reasonable to expect that someone with the vaccine clears the virus faster than someone without."
14267,Increased antibodies and T cell memory = faster response.
14268,"If it didn’t, vaccines wouldn’t work."
14269,"So it stands to reason that they clear the virus faster, since the response is faster."
14270,If: you clear the virus faster *and* an asymptomatic vaccinated person sheds the virus at the same rate (or slower) as an asymptomatic non-vaccinated person **then** that person will be less contagious overall.
14271,It’s a simple line.
14272,Total infectiousness = avg infectiousness * Time.
14273,"Decrease time, total infectiousness decreases"
14274,"Oh, having commuted to Manhattan throughout his time of refusing to shut down non essential businesses and schools, I beg to differ... he created an utter fucking shit show and only made decisions after CA and other cities and entire states had done the same."

14287,Your naivety is baffling.
14288,This guy Aldis.
14289,Where are “all the headlines”.
14290,Everything I’ve seen says the vaccines should be fine against the variants.
14291,Depends on the part of Texas.
14292,"Houston is close to the Gulf of Mexico, so, we tend to get more rain than Far West Texas, Central Texas, and the Panhandle."
14293,EDIT: During the summer I try to stay in after a heavy rain because the humidity will be close to 100% and you start sweating the minute you step outside.
14294,Colorado becomes the new location for ‘vaccine tourism’.
14295,It's not right that richer countries have to make up for poorer countries that dont make their own vaccine either so eh.
14296,"I’ve had plenty of parties, do I have other things to do then party 24/7 like a mindless zombie?"
14297,Sure do.
14298,Garbage
14299,That is when most people thought it was just the flu and were therefor not that interested
14300,"From the article:

”Requiring proof of ID, especially a government-issued ID, can exacerbate distrust and accessibility inequities for many critical groups."
14301,"This requirement is a barrier for people who are unable to get identification or have trouble accessing services that issue IDs, such as those who are undocumented, experiencing homelessness, have a disability, or others on the margins of society who are unable to get an ID.”

The state warns any provider who does choose to require ID could be stripped of access to vaccine supply."
14302,But it would need trials... basically the scenario is: the time is takes to test and produce a vaccine is enough to have several new variants multiply and spread.
14303,It's a losing battle.
14304,Yeah.
14305,We all saw what was happening in Wuhan and no one did anything about it.

14310,"What you say is absolutely correct, about effective delivery outside of major metro areas."
14311,The infrastructure is not there.
14312,There are not enough refrigerated trucks that can maintain the temps etc.
14313,for proper delivery to rural areas.
14314,There are not enough local clinics in rural areas that have the freezer capacity etc.
14315,The roads aren't in good enough shape to ensure delivery on time.
14316,"What is needed in countries like this is a less-temperature sensitive, one-shot vaccine."
14317,it's not right but it's ok
14318,Need to see paper - and have it replicated - but that would be rather serious and need a new vaccine.
14319,Agreed.
14320,"Once everyone has actually had the opportunity for a vaccine, then we need to slowly remove restrictions and monitor."
14321,"But goalposts haven't been moved much at all, if anything it's due to the lack of compliance from anti-maskers and not enough restrictions, and the slow rollout of the vaccines."
14322,But at least vaccines *are* rolling out.
14323,As long as there's no significant setbacks along the way we'll likely see some semblance of normal by summer.
14324,"I don't see any reason to impose restrictions after everyone's been vaccinated or at least offered vaccination, unless they find the vaccine isn't nearly as effective or has as lasting immunity as they thought."
14325,Vaccines are efficient against both the UK and the S-American variant of the virus.
14326,This is a non issue and qualify as fear-mongerring.

14350,"A travel ban from China in February would have done nothing, it had already seeded superspreader clusters at ski resorts in the Alps by then."
14351,A travel ban between different countries in Europe might have done something marginal but also never in a million years would have been implemented.
14352,WTF???
14353,how dare you state facts that the gloomers on this sub try to ignore???
14354,"on a sidenote, 10k cases in israel is like 300k cases in the usa, they have alot of already infected, add the not reported and vaccinations and u should have a significant portion of the pop immune."
14355,yet cases are not slowing down by any means.
14356,"something is not adding up, but noone asks this questions cuz  bAcK tO nOrMaLcy bY eArlY sPrInG."
14357,You have a lot of people pushing back because they’re afraid a permanent culture change is being shoved down their throats.
14358,"Agree, disagree, it doesn’t matter."
14359,Its perception.
14360,The fact that we’ve never addressed that concern directly is why there is so much resistance.
14361,"Anytime you hear “when life is more normal” it’s nearly always coupled with “but continued masking may be necessary” 
Continued masking to a lot of people basically means the life they knew is going through the shredder and the people imposing it are dismissive about it, sometimes downright giddy."
14362,We never tried dealing with the behavioral side of this it’s been all virus transmission all the time.

14364,I still don’t get how I know of at least 2 husband and wives where one got the virus and the other didn’t despite sleeping in the same bed.
14365,This virus is bizarre and seems to pick people at random
14366,lol at you just making shit up.
14367,Not exactly.
14368,"First, we'd need to see how effective (or ineffective) the vaccines are to the new strains."
14369,Lockdowns might actually have to occur again if it is so resistant as to cause a health crisis equal to the current one.
14370,"If vaccines fight against it well enough to not have a sufficient death count to warrant lockdowns, then we won't be delayed at all."
14371,"If on the off chance that it is extremely resistant, then yeah, we may see months of trials to try to get another vaccine working."
14372,"But even if we have to lock down for that varient, chances are that will be the last one."
14373,The virus will have been suppressed by the vaccine so there will be a reduced chance of it mutating.
14374,"So I'd take the position that once everyone gets vaccinated for the most prominent strains, the other ones are not going to be as effective."
14375,"So at most, social distancing and mask wearing will still be warranted, but not lockdowns."
14376,"&gt;Reeves said the federal pharmacy program, which partnered with Walgreens and CVS to administer doses to long-term care facilities, appears to have over-allocated based on the number of individuals that are actually going to take the vaccine."
14377,He noted that somewhere between 75% and 85% of nursing home residents are opting to take the vaccine while only about 33% of employees are opting to receive it.

14381,"I mean, I'd rather have a cold than go into anaphylactic shock."
14382,"We have been banned from entering America from March (Europeans) time, so if your racism claim is based on a 3 or 4 week period then it’s as shaky as a shitting dog"
14383,"Something feels slightly off about letting random people track individual vaccine deliveries but I can't quite put my finger on it :)

But for real, I am as addicted to having access to the raw data as anyone but I really have no business tracking individual vaccine shipments."
14384,"It all just reminds me of those classic semi-jokes like ""what one programmer can do alone in one month, two programmers can do together in two months"" and ""the perfect is the enemy of the good."""
14385,We are all just sitting around trying to come up with a perfect or quickest way to get this done but realistically its much better to just get it started in a not horrible way and improve the process as you go along.
14386,Was about to say the same thing!

14388,We already donate a lot to poorer countries.
14389,We don't owe anyone anything.
14390,This isn't a world government.
14391,Nations have a right to take care of their people first.
14392,There’s a long history of research doing horrific things in the US.
14393,"Henry K. Beecher, a highly respected physician-investigator from Harvard University, shocked the medical community when he published an influential article entitled “Ethics and Clinical Research” in the New England Journal of Medicine in 1966."
14394,"In this article, he concluded that unethical or questionable ethical practices were common in the conduct of human subjects research in many premier U.S. research institutions."
14395,Beecher cited no fewer than 22 examples of research studies with controversial ethics.
14396,"In 1963, studies were undertaken at New York’s Jewish Chronic Disease Hospital to understand whether the body’s inability to reject cancer cells was due to cancer or debilitation."
14397,"These studies involved the injection of foreign, live cancer cells into patients who were hospitalized with various chronic debilitating diseases."
14398,"Patients were not informed about the injection of cancer cells during the informed consent process, and consent was not documented."
14399,The researchers felt that documentation was unnecessary because it was customary to undertake much more dangerous medical procedures without the use of consent forms.
14400,"Further, patients were intentionally not told that they would receive cancer cells because the researchers felt it would unnecessarily frighten them."
14401,Researchers asserted that they had good cause to predict that the cancer cells were going to be rejected.
14402,"In subsequent review proceedings conducted by the Board of Regents of the State University of New York, it was found that the study had not been presented to the hospital’s research committee and that the physicians responsible for the patients’ care had not been consulted."
14403,"The researchers were found guilty of fraud, deceit, and unprofessional conduct."
14404,"A series of studies was conducted from 1963 through 1966 at the Willowbrook State School, a New York institution for “mentally defective” children."
14405,"To gain an understanding of the natural history of infectious hepatitis under controlled circumstances, newly admitted children were deliberately infected with the hepatitis virus."
14406,Early subjects were fed the stools of infected persons.
14407,"Later, subjects received injections of more purified virus preparations."
14408,"During the course of these studies, Willowbrook closed its doors to new patients, claiming overcrowded conditions."
14409,"However, the hepatitis program, because it occupied its own space at the institution, was able to continue to admit new patients."
14410,"Thus, in some cases, parents found they were unable to admit their children to Willowbrook unless they agreed to their children’s participation in the studies."
14411,"This controversial case raised important questions about the protection of children (and vulnerable populations generally), coercive consent, inappropriate disclosure of risks, and alternative therapies."

14429,"Security as well - prior to COVID 19 you were not allowed to wear a mask in a bank, for instance."
14430,Society is simply not made for wearing masks.
14431,Probably not.
14432,I believe Moderna already put out a statement saying they believe they could do it in weeks without approval.

14444,"Even if you do manage to get infected after getting the vaccine, you'll likely be asymptomatic."
14445,This means you won't be coughing.
14446,That alone will reduce the transmission of the virus.
14447,"Couple this with the fact that you're infected for a shorter period of time, and it's pretty obvious that there will be some reduction in spread."
14448,"The ""bUt wE dOn'T knoW"" shit is getting old."

14460,"Yeah, at this point it is clear that some people take this stuff seriously and some people just don't take it seriously."
14461,The responsible people are still at home and wearing masks when they go out.
14462,With the irresponsible people the virus might be running out of opportunities to infect new people since so many have already gotten it.
14463,"I got my first shot of Pfizer on Sunday, and yesterday my arm hurt yesterday from the injection."
14464,Last night I was restless while sleeping and had some vivid dreams.
14465,"Worth noting that they are investigating that specific lot of vaccines, not the Moderna vaccine as a whole."
14466,Wow wtf.
14467,Here in Europe they just paid more than any other super market chain and they have a very low turnover.
14468,On the other hand I heard they make they lower management work crazy hours
14469,"Anecdotal, but I have two family members who are firemen and both had Covid recently."
14470,Most of their firehouse were infected as well.
14471,Bakersfield and Long Beach.
14472,"The United States lost more than 23,000 lives to COVID-19 last week, setting a record for the third week in a row, though the number of new infections and the number of patients in hospitals both fell from the previous seven days."
14473,"The country reported more than 1.5 million new cases of COVID-19 in the week ended Jan. 17, down 12% from the previous week, and only eight out of 50 states posted a rise in new infections, according to a Reuters analysis of state and county reports."

14533,It helps that it's not winter in Florida.
14534,You're misunderstanding... No one is saying masks forever.
14535,We're asking for masks until enough people are vaccinated.
14536,Vaccines will allow returning to normal...
14537,But they're going to take time to roll out to enough people.
14538,"Just because **you** have a shot doesn't mean the rest of us do...

You realize that if we say ""if you're vaccinated t no need for a mask!"""
14539,We're inviting everyone to just lie about being vaccinated?

14541,"They are not 'walking back' wearing masks, they are recommending against homemade cloth masks because they can't be guaranteed to work as effectively as standardized industrially-made ones."
14542,"You don't attribute the lower number of colds to less people actually being on the subway, less going out, etc?"

14546,"Give the dose to people who are actually at risk of having complications, once they are vaccinated what does it matter if they take the shot or not ?"
14547,Oh fuck off Canada.
14548,"Personally even if I got vaccinated before most people, I would continue to wear a mask until most people have been vaccinated, but then once we reach herd immunity, I'll just stick to wearing them during cold and flu season (and also because my face gets cold in the winter when I go outside and I have since discovered that if I wear a mask outside when it's cold, my nose doesn't run like it usually does when I'm outside in the cold.)"
14549,They are a really decent company.
14550,Oh and the only place in the US to get actual perishable pastries and cakes that is actually made in France or Italy.
14551,"It’s hard for many westerners to believe, but most of the worlds Pharmaceutical requirements are fulfilled by the Pharma industries from South Asia."
14552,So a lot of these countries do have the capability of mass manufacturing their own doses.
14553,South America too has a massive Pharma industry.
14554,And AstraZenecas licence with Serum firmly excludes astra from any liabilities in case of adverse events from the vaccine made locally.
14555,That is borne solely by serum institute alone.
14556,So I’m not sure why you’d assume that the big Pharma companies in the west have any skin in the game at all.

14572,Some time ago I read they would offer a mobile app to collect feedback or something.

14574,Yeah somehow I think people would rather be influenced by getting money thrown at them instead of bullets and artillery shells.
14575,"Obviously China is engaging in imperialism, but passing off the Scramble for Africa as similar to this is, once again, whitewashing European colonial history."

14656,"I’m sitting here 26 hours out with a 102 fever, I spent all night in the bathroom having full body vomiting and my bones hurt so bad, even sitting on the couch is painful."
14657,I had no idea it was going to be this bad and there no way I would have been able to work like this.
14658,Hopefully it will come soon :)

14661,"Considering there were more violent riots in the United States in the past year than the past ten years, I'd say it's pretty accurate."
14662,The entire country has gotten cabin fever.
14663,younger people can not singlehandedly overwhelm the healthcare system.
14664,"20% is most definitely a false estimate because that literally means 1 in every 5 non elderly people who get coronavirus go to the hospital and that’s objectively false (as in, I’m willing to guess that was a selective estimate for a worst-case scenario group of young adults)."
14665,"In any case, up to 20% factors in younger people with at-risk factors and them being vaccinated is factored into “at-risk groups”."
14666,Life needs to resumes and once deaths are gone that’s what’s happening.
14667,Idk.
14668,"Maybe because of the news about J&amp;Js production problems, US not even getting AZ till April and the already slow rollout."
14669,We don't even know if J&amp;J is very effective yet either
14670,"Dunno about America however over here in the UK salaried for aldi is hours back

So if you work an extra 30 hours."
14671,You are owed 30 hours.
14672,Sadly you don't need that kind of important information to write an article.
14673, I was being conservative with the 3x  amount.
14674,We now know up to 80% of people are asymptomatic - I’m pretty sure that hiker is much higher.
14675,I’m in Texas and it’s pretty insane here.
14676,You wouldn’t know it though.

14680,“Young adults should live with restrictions for the next 2-3 years until old people in poor countries get vaccinated”

14683,Don't have the same hang ups about these words that you do.
14684,I just like to poke fun.
14685,Herd immunity is a stupid goal if only because it's nearly impossible to achieve.
14686,"Not only is there less than 70-85 percent of the population that would be willing to take a vaccine at the moment, 70-85 percent of the population aren't even vaccine eligible (e.g., under 16)."
14687,"""Herd immunity"" can't be the goal for being able to be normal again because a) it's literally not possible with the tools we have available now, and b) no one even knows what the true herd immunity value even is."
14688,It's a metric that's too nebulous and too difficult to accurately measure.
14689,I know.
14690,Like I said this blows.
14691,"I miss my friends terribly, but we get thru it because we have to."
14692,It doesn't sound like covid has any plans of leaving unless the vaccines are super successful so we need to deal.
14693,Humans are also inventive and adaptable when we bother to be.
14694,My hope is we all come out of this with a new appreciation for things we took for granted (or even hated like school.)
14695,I keep thinking how this would be if it happened before smart phones and zoom meetings.

14708,"Not that all the at risk people will have been vaccinated by then, but as we saw with HCW, i think there will be enough examples of vaccination slots going unused due to demand mismatch that states will open things to ensure their vaccination numbers stay up."

14740,Worked for them as a “store manager trainee” for almost 2 years.
14741,This is basically an in between position designed to hold you until a store manager position opens.
14742,"However, in the market I was in, you basically had to wait for someone to die to get that job."
14743,They rarely built new stores and had a crop of almost 20 trainees waiting.
14744,"During your “training” time you are shipped from store to store (sometimes upwards of 60 miles away, one way) to be a glorified assistant manager, with no management powers."
14745,Store managers still have the final say in everything and you essentially have to do all their dirty work.
14746,District managers are hired right out of college with basically no job experience and have little to no people skills.
14747,The turnover for DM’s was crazy high when I was there because they are on  call 24 hours a day and get burnt out quickly.
14748,Not to mention they keep the staff as thin as possible.
14749,"I’m talking 4-5 employees only working at any given time, and that was on a weekend."
14750,"Weekdays, there was the opening manager and maybe 2 other employees responsible for unloading the truck, stocking the shelves and running the registers."
14751,It was nuts.
14752,"I worked for Trader Joe’s as well, for over 6 years and the treatment there was much better."
14753,They didn’t track our items per minute on the register (managers at Aldi would go over this number with you at the end of your shift and basically use low numbers as a reason to fire you).
14754,The culture was more laid back at TJ’s and I used to actually have fun at work sometimes!

14759,Obviously vaccines are a little different.
14760,I think those should absolutely be required since it’s literally impacts the patients end of things.
14761,But Hospitals vetting would be hires or current staff on their opinions on all this stuff would just never work.

14830,I.e.
14831,most of the economy and schools staying open while the Spanish Flu killed millions (and probably mutated to become more deadly) is more normal than deciding we couldn't live with the death toll of an uncontrolled pandemic.

14888,"50% of people don't want to get the vaccine, which means we're going to be dealing with covid and its mutated versions for years, when we could easily eradicate it in 2021."

14958,I really need new glasses since my vision has gotten worse
14959,"Yes easy to pull out the old island, tiny population trick."
14960,"If leaders gave a fuck about their country folk, things would have turned out much different."
14961,Many many countries that could have adopted the same style as NZ and Aus but fucked it up completely.
14962,They rack up so much overtime and make north of 300k per year in many cases
14963,"Software engineers typically currently make above the salary threshold that's in the law about overtime, last I checked."
14964,then make it taboo to talk about pay with co workers cuz you don't wanna rock the boat for the OWNERS....
14965,"Lol virtue signaling and bringing up money, impressive!"
14966,Just wait until we grasp just how much lockdowns costed and the vast mental health issues they've caused.
14967,"Imagine being ignorant enough to compare Europe's genocidal, bloodthirsty, absolutely barbaric colonization of Africa to China's giving Africa subprime loans and FDI lmaoooo"

14970,We just had a attempted coup by a bunch of middle aged men and millennials are not that much different in honesty
14971,both the amount of and frequency of goalposts being moved is such an incredible thing to witness in real time

14976,"Right, and it's not like anyone breaking quarantine for the first time would end up there."
14977,It's for people knowingly and willingly refusing to stay in quarantine more than once.
14978,Probably the same idiots who still think Covid-19 is a hoax.
14979,We need to approve AstraZeneca
14980,"So a couple things of note:

&gt;Hopping in a car is a roll of the dice."
14981,Which is why we try to do everything we can to make it safer.
14982,"For example, we don't let young children drive, we require car safety and inspections, and require seatbelts."
14983,Getting struck by lightning is significantly less likely (and happens to far fewer people) than dying in a car accident.
14984,So would you then say it's a good idea (or more reasonable because cars technically kill more people) to climb a tall tree during a thunderstorm?
14985,"&gt;If you really cared about children's health, you'd be advocating to close schools every winter for the flu."
14986,"I don't follow, since we have a vaccine for the flu that is approved and recommended for children, which makes a full school closure unnecessary if proper vaccinations are recieved."
14987,I think a reasonable person would advocate for stronger enforcement of flu vaccination for children and easier access to flu vaccines for students.
14988,"However, *if the vaccine hypothetically didn't exist*, then yes of course I would prefer a school closure during winter if it meant fewer children would suffer (and potentially die) from flu."
14989,Firefighters get paid really really well in california at least.
14990,Go to transparentcalifornia.com to see
14991,We need to approve AstraZeneca
14992,I'm pretty torn on this.
14993,"Yes, it would be a good way to increase trust in the vaccine, especially among African Americans."
14994,"On the other hand, vaccinating all the NBA players would coincidentally allow them to have a 2021 season and rake in big money."
14995,Coincidence?
14996,"Also on the other hand, the part of me that's been isolating and avoiding restaurants and crowds and high risk places for the past 9+ months could give two shits about catering to vaccine skeptics."
14997,It's winter now and I'm going stir crazy from isolation.
14998,Don't want it?
14999,I'll take it.
15000,We can worry about convincing those people later.
15001,There are so many priorities in trying to beat Covid but this is just as important if not more so than anything.
15002,"As a parent of two daughters ages 9 and 5, we have to get our kids back in school ASAP."
15003,"In California, my kids have been in Distance learning since 3/20/20."
15004,I was never one to think about mental health of children because most kids are resilient and will bounce back.
15005,I am genuinely worried now about both of my daughters’ mental well being.
15006,Kids need to be in the classroom.
15007,Except the comment you replied to is guilty of exactly that.
15008,"They found the PDF and didn't read the exemptions in detail, which explains why assistant managers and store managers are almost always exempt from being paid OT."
15009,This is what Biden is planning to do.
15010,Activate FEMA and set up vaccine sites.
15011,"Well, as I understand the Canadian doses are made in Belgium rather than the US."
15012,In Belgium they are rebuilding their factory so they basically can double their output.
15013,"It is a temporary setback, but soon they will be able to produce more doses than before."
15014,[removed]
15015,Two thirds plus people who've already gotten covid should get us there.
15016,"Plus I can only imagine the people who will get the vaccine will go up over time, as it polls have been showing."
15017,"Yeah, seeing the total impact of this pandemic will be really telling.... feel like even people who are taking this seriously don’t understand the full magnitude"
15018,You say they showed it but daycare and schools under high school aren't super spread events.
15019,"You had about a kid or a teacher, but not like a bunch in one school getting infected constantly."
15020,This sub would be so over those stories if that was the case.
15021,4 x 14 = 56.
15022,500k by **mid** February is still a big deal
15023,Maybe.
15024,"I wouldn't call it a ""complete"" failure, but I certainly wouldn't call it a total success, either."
15025,But my point is that CureVac will enter a marketplace where BionTech (and probably Astrazeneca) dominate.
15026,Bayer will have to ramp up production and sell hundreds of thousands of doses where Pfizer can offer tens of millions.
15027,The production will be challenging and no one will want to wait for Bayer to sort out production glitches or supply problems.
15028,"The best case for Bayer would be to have tens, if not hundreds, of millions of doses ready when the approval comes."
15029,"But even then these batches need to be tested, checked, and verified and someone needs to distribute them."
15030,It will be an uphill battle to sell them.
15031,lmao what a horrible sub
15032,[removed]
15033,Nah not cruel got to look after yourselves.
15034,The US has a much bigger problem than we do here.
15035,I would ask Michigan to do us a solid to get our healthcare workers (5-6k of them I think) who cross the border from Windsor to work there to get them vaccinated.
15036,Just so they don't bring it back with them.
15037,Windsor is in tough.
15038,Probably happening anyways but who knows.

15040,Bishops tend not to be as involved with the general public as your average priest would be so this is very surprising.
15041,Bishops tend to be 50+ and the very few bishops who are younger than that are nearly all in the Ukraine; they are more susceptible as  a population than other professions.
15042,"I am surprised though, the various conferences have been virtual since March of last year, bishops aren't usually able to leave their jurisdictions aside from conferences just from standard business."
15043,Very sad situation.

15045,It's OK Canada has a plan.

15048,Gotta love free trade eh?

15050,"You seem to assume that the German government acts in the interest of its own people first, which has not been true for a long time now."
15051,"They happily sold us out to France again to ""strengthen Europe""."
15052,That is more important to them than getting a life-saving vaccine to their own people as quickly as is humanly possible.
15053,"If you criticize them for it, you are called a ""vaccine nationalist"", which is pretty much the same as a neo-Nazi, apparently."
15054,"I dont understand, they keep changing between 100 million doses and 100 million people, I dont see how 100 million doses would be a challenge at all considering we will have 2 more vaccines approved in the next few weeks..."
15055,Doubt it.
15056,I’ve heard of many different organizations (gov and nongov) trying to schedule in waves so that their entire workforce doesn’t feel like shit the day they get their second vaccines.
15057,Pfizer.
15058,I figured I’d have a low grade fever and myalgias.
15059,I never expected the bone pain.
15060,Now I didn’t pre treat myself with anti inflammatory medications because I didn’t want to blunt my immune response.
15061,Perhaps I should have.
15062,"It's the same thing with people calling all headaches ""migraines."""
15063,"I've had many headaches, but I know I have a migraine due to the extreme light sensitivity, vomiting, and floaters."
15064,"Likewise, I've had many colds, but I know I had the flu when I had serious body aches (back in particular) in addition to my 101 fever, chills, etc."
15065,"Since at least Memorial Day weekend I’ve seen numerous pictures of overcrowded Cle and Spire, and thin this past weekend Cle had that Bow Wow concert that got negative press around the country for it’s covidiotness."

15071,"If you think something is illegal, call the police!"
15072,Don't argue about it.
15073,Good grief.
15074,I wear that shit 8 hours a day under sweltering conditions.
15075,"Pandemic privilege, right here."
15076,I think it's just a joke referring to how they charge you for bags at checkout rather than giving them to you for free unlike most other stores.
15077,that's not how media companies make money buddy
15078,Until you come up to lake county and no one wears a mask here.
15079,So many people just don’t care here.
15080,In some cases.
15081,In some cases where you won't be able to tell until you've unsealed the product... or even tasted it.
15082,Where you can save a whole 20 cents on the stuff for a can/box/container of the same size.

15086,But population no city in California is even in the top 100 largest cities in the world.
15087,"If you include metro area then LA ends up ~25th, but there's no other city in the top 100 even by that metric."
15088,It might.
15089,Franklin was a master wordsmith and Biden could do worse than to simply quote some of the things he said then:.
15090,"https://www.usapatriotism.org/quotes/roosevelt-fd.htm

A nation that destroys it's soils destroys 
itself."
15091,"Forests are the lungs of our land, purifying the air and giving fresh strength to our people."
15092,Be sincere; be brief; be seated.
15093,"Confidence... thrives on honesty, on honor, on the sacredness of obligations,on faithful protection and on unselfishperformance."
15094,"Without them it cannot live..

Human kindness has never weakened
the stamina or softened the fiber of a free people."
15095,A nation does not have to be cruel to be tough.
15096,I sometimes think that the saving grace of America lies in the fact that the overwhelming majority of Americans are possessed of two great qualities- a sense of humor and a sense of proportion.
15097,The test of our progress is not whether we add more to the abundance of those who have much; it is whether we provide enough for those who have too little.
15098,"First of all, let me assert my firm belief that the only thing we have to fear is fear itself - nameless, unreasoning, unjustified terror which paralyzes needed efforts to convert retreat into advance."
15099,"If civilization is to survive, we must cultivate the science of human relationships - the ability of all peoples of all kinds, to live together, in the same world at peace."
15100,Let us never forget that government is ourselves and not an alien power over us..
15101,"The ult
 ite tulers of our democracy are not a President and senators and congressmen and government , but the voters of this country"
15102,The roll out is shit.
15103,Lack of urgency and planning
15104,what is 21 one days compared to last year...
15105,Videos like this prove that anti-maskers and COVID deniers aren't 'spirited' by any stretch of the imagination.
15106,They are looking to cause trouble and paint themselves as victims.
15107,"China was locking down the city, and WHO was still saying that it's safe to travel to and from it."
15108,"As for my government, they began a lockdown and closed borders a week after the first diagnosed case, March 14."
15109,Three days after WHO declared the pandemic.
15110,You say that as if mental health is less valid than physical health.
15111,Why?
15112,Obviously that person is an asshole.
15113,"But they’re also obviously not well, and compassion is risk free and costs nothing."
15114,That would require Bezos to have some semblance of a soul
15115,Fucking stupid.

15122,Thank you!
15123,"prolly until may if the cold persists, maybe more with the new variant but that's a scary thought to be avoided"
15124,It's the Chinese workers from offshore gambling companies breaking the law.
15125,Nothing to be surprised about.
15126,"I vaguely remember MSM reporting rising cases in each of China's provinces, until all of them were hit, while we were out here, ""heerrrr derrrrrrrr""."
15127,&gt; Fortin said the country will receive about 50% of the previously expected shipments over that four-week period.

15130,Yes why not?
15131,They have nothing to gain from not telling it like it is /s
15132,Not sure about all states but I know California has very specific rules regarding salaried employees and overtime.
15133,There is a whole list of requirements and if you meet any of them you don't get OT but if you don't meet them you are eligible for OT.
15134,My husband's employer sends out two lists each year.

15139,I know in LA county (most populous in US) vaccine centers were closed on Monday for the holiday
15140,As for the cases in Italy - did you read the article that proposed that theory?
15141,"If I remember correctly from reading it, it looked at blood of patients from that period, and checked for the virus with their own technology, while not verifying the false positive ratio against any clean samples."
15142,"As far as we know, if they had access to 1990s blood, their tests would show that SARS-CoV-2 was present back then as well."

15144,"""Alexa, how many people died from heart disease or stroke in 2020?"""
15145,I love how you are actively trying to minimize the horrifically poor health of American society and its role in exacerbating this covid crisis.

15147,I hope he gets better and I hope he does find it worth it.
15148,I’m sure he’ll be fine.
15149,"Yep, because they closed schools but left the economy open, the numbers barely went down."
15150,As if people would be immune to infections while working with dozens or hundreds of people.
15151,Merkel really messed it up the last months.

15154,"I didn't realize any Americans died of COVID-19 in WWII 


(sry, I had to make fun of that strangely ambiguously worded headline)"
15155,"Nonsense, nobody knew and responsible countries still ordered them in bulk."
15156,"Because it was best case you get a working vaccine asap, worst case you lose a little money."
15157,Every week of lockdown costs much more than vaccines for everyone.
15158,Not to mention the cost in lives lost.
15159,I dont understand these incentives.
15160,Is the vaccine even available to the general public?
15161,It kinda feels like a PR stunt if they're offering pay for something their employees can't even do.
15162,"Also, don't trust a British newspaper (even the Guardian) when it claims an “EU debacle”."
15163,"Right now, we *do* have more vaccine than we are able to inject (at least in France, where we injected only about 30% of available stocks...)."
15164,And think for 2s about what the alternative would have been: 27 countries competing with each other for vaccines... what a mess.
15165,"Two thirds isn’t enough for herd immunity, is it?"
15166,I think I remember reading that 70% is needed for that.
15167,Don’t draw any conclusions until we get the CDC data.
15168,It’ll be more complete than Bloomberg.
15169,It should come out within an hour
15170,"I want to chime in that I think it's hilarious that you wrote this diatribe begging people to accept things as fact before there's evidence, and yet under one of my comments, which including easily verifiable and oft-repeated claims, you wrote this:

15238,"Best case scenario, some wont spread it."

15242,"If you can get covid, you can absolutely spread it."

15265,Because the roll out is shit.

15274,Sometimes it happens via the equivalent of shrinkflation where they just give you smaller sizes... but when it gets down to the point that the can only fits 1 olive or whatever that just won't work.
15275,It has to come from the quality of the ingredients.
15276,Everything else is more or less fixed cost.
15277,"&gt; Dude, EU had to yell at McDonalds for selling pink slime as meat

Which it is."
15278,"But some asshole not-really-a-journalist coined a term ""pink slime"" and suddenly you were aghast someone might want to scrape some of the meat off the bones that wasn't easily separated."
15279,"&gt; You're naive if you think the big names will not buy the cheap shit even if they aren't forced to

How are they not forced to?"
15280,"If McDonald's only other choice was to sell burgers made from USDA prime, and the cost of the quarter pounder doubles in the space of a year... they're just supposed to do that, go bankrupt, and you'll pat them on the back with ""yeh you're insolvent, but at least you didn't stoop to pink slime""?"

15287,"Then I remember about 1997ish, when they were no longer indistinguishable."
15288,And the noodles were made with inferior ingredients.

15310,"The original story in UK tabloid press missed out vital elements like how many vaccinated and how many care home deaths happen each week, what percentage of people who had the vaccine died ( unsurprisingly it was much less than 80 year olds who get covid) ."
15311,"We tried to point this out to a family member in their 80s, who saw the Norway story and said 'See I told you so!'"
15312,and that the drug companies are out to make money so the vaccine must be toxic.
15313,For some reason they're happy to believe a UK tabloids interpretation of the Norway deaths over actual scientists but believe people are gullible to believe covid deaths are real.
15314,What can you do?
15315,It infuriates me.
15316,Now people in the UK are seeing the same trashy tabloids saying care home deaths have gone up and are deciding the vaccine killed those people.
15317,They must have forgotten nursing homes deaths were doubling back in the first wave before the vaccine existed.
15318,Are you trying to win some roundabout covid skeptic argument against me or are you really truly invested in French domestic health policy?
15319,Seriously?
15320,😩
15321,I create models for this kind of stuff for a living.
15322,I agree with the original commenter.
15323,There is clearly a sign that the number of new cases and deaths have likely peaked and are beginning to fall.
15324,The shape of the 7 day average curve is pretty flat at a point that looks very similar to the peaks of the previous waves.
15325,Also the log curve has flattened which shows that the acceleration of new cases (and deaths) has slowed significantly.
15326,I look at https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/country/us/ pretty often which appears to show the same trend.
15327,I think socal or parts of socal are going to have the virus circulating for a long time at this rate.
15328,There was a story like this with healthcare workers.
15329,"Similar deal with other communities full of vaccine-""skeptics"" like white evangelicals."
15330,"Yes, but she had several conferences with the state leaders and while some of those demanded a shutdown of the whole economy, she was clearly positioned against this suggestion."
15331,"And no matter who decided what, in the end, as chancellor, you are resposible."
15332,"OK, deaf ears I guess."
15333,I'm just saying that it's okay to be not okay with a vaccine that hasn't been fully vetted.
15334,Just because you have a relative that has already outlived the actuarial age doesn't mean that anyone else needs to be a Guinea pig or else lose their livelihood.

15585,Of course covid measures can go too far.
15586,"For example, shooting people on the streets because they failed to comply with a lockdown, that's definitely going too far."
15587,Or putting people in actual camps is going too far.
15588,At least one state in Germany now locks people up in detention centers if they absolutely refuse to stay at home after a positive test.
15589,"This is pretty mild, it's not even a prison and shouldn't be seen as punishment at all."
15590,It's just a way to protect everyone else from getting infected because of their irresponsible behavior.
15591,They can leave the place after a week or two and that's it (maybe some fines will await them at home because they broke the law – that's the actual punishment).
15592,"I mean, we put people into these deportation centers for much less severe things that are not dangerous at all (like not having the correct government documents or maybe giving an incorrect birth year or name when registering for asylum in Germany 30 years ago), and usually they are not allowed to leave the place after a week."
15593,We put them in a plane and forcefully send them to some other country.
15594,THAT'S really scary!
15595,"But it's hard to deny, right?"
15596,I was already wondering where today's variant would come from.. i thinks it's Czech republic tomorrow and then Egypt after that.
15597,Can anyone please explain to me how the vaccine provides more protection against infection than catching the virus does from catching it again?
15598,"I've had it twice now, 8 months apart."
15599,How can a vaccine possibly prepare my body for dealing with the disease better than that?

15611,You are correct
15612,"If you mean priority group 1, that is correct."
15613,That group is those at the absolute highest risk of needing hospital care or dying.
15614,"Your relative should be in priority group 4, 5 or 6 depending on the nature of their conditions and their exact age."
15615,"The 'phase 1' of vaccine delivery actually includes priority groups that cover all adults over 50, so your relative is definitely in one of them."
15616,"I wish no-one had to wait, especially those like your relative who have had to isolate for so long; but their experience doesn't mean something has gone wrong with the vaccine rollout, which is still in the very early stages."

15683,*
15684,I'm not disagreeing with you but my concern is if a vaccine has to be adjusted and then mass-produced and then distributed that's going to take some time and we are already failing pretty bad at administering our current vaccines.
15685,Even if it only take 6 weeks to create a new vaccine how much longer will it take to distribute and then administer the adjusted vaccines?
15686,How many people are going to get sick and die in that frame?
15687,I looked at the way this thing has spread from the get go.
15688,"Starts at the coasts, moves in toward the center and down to the south."
15689,Then proceeds outward in reverse.
15690,Then back inward again.
15691,Out and in.
15692,"We saw the second spikes in numbers for the middle and south stwrt after Halloween through Thanksgiving and then fall off, while numbers started to go nuts back out at the coasts (generalized, of course, there are states here and there doing a better job of keeping their ""surges"" low and short lived)."
15693,The vaccine roll out isn't great.
15694,"There's no stockpile for 2nd doses and many states didn't even get their full ""allotment"" of initial doses."
15695,"Pfizer and Moderna say they should be able to provide supply, but they are supplying the whole world, not just US."
15696,Part of me wants to be hopeful yet I see what it's like in my community and surrounding communities.
15697,"It's like folks masked up and did more distancing because the hospitals said ""we're full if you people don't do your part, then if you need help you're gonna be SOL,"" now that numbers are slowly declining, everyone is right back to behaving badly."

15769,He tested negative then positive.
15770,So we went even longer not isolated from each other (but isolated from the public).
15771,I was 30 weeks pregnant and the doctor advised me it would be fine to isolate together because we had a small child that wouldn’t understand why we couldn’t be together/may be infected too and live in a very small house.
15772,"She basically said with the level of exposure we already had/lack of risk factors, there wasn’t much of a point putting the child through so much stress."

15774,"The only precaution we took was distancing was not being in each other’s faces, kissing, sharing food or drinks, etc."

15782,They mutate randomly and occasionally the random mutations make the virus spread more effectively.

15792,Lol your upvotes vs op's contradict your statement.
15793,"It's actually pretty obvious that Japan get bashed quite a lot, almost as much as the US, for things other countries get free passes on."
15794,"Who are we talking about here:

&gt;**Who has to be in quarantine for how long**  
&gt;  
&gt;Anyone who has a **high** risk of being infected or who is a so-called Category I contact person must be in quarantine (domestic isolation)."
15795,"&gt;  
&gt;Such a risk can in principle arise in two ways."
15796,"On the one hand, it can be the case that you have had close contact with a person who is likely to be contagious within 1.5 meters, often as part of a longer speech contact."
15797,"On the other hand, it may be that you had contact while there was a high concentration of infectious aerosols in the room, which means that the distance to the individual persons was no longer decisive (see also the topic page “What to do if you suspect an infection with the SARS coronavirus -CoV-2?"
15798,"""And the question"" What role do aerosols play in the transmission of the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus?"

15800,"&gt;  
&gt;The responsible health department is responsible for assessing the risk of infection and thus ordering and lifting the quarantine."
15801,"&gt;  
&gt;The Robert Koch Institute (RKI) recommends domestic isolation or quarantine for 14 days for close contact persons in Category I - calculated from the last day of contact with a person who was contagious at the time."
15802,"The quarantine can be shortened to 10 days if there is a negative test result for the coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 (using a PCR or antigen test); the test may be carried out on the tenth day of quarantine at the earliest (see also the topic page ""Tests for an infection with the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus"" and the question ""What detection methods (tests) are there?"")"

16132,It may be beginning of a decade-long suffering.
16133,It is so fucking weird.
16134,I simply can’t talk to my brother right now cause he keeps posting all these vacations and ski trips and then talks about his bubble.

16140,"Thanksgiving at current vaccination and infection rates; Memorial Day if both logistics issues are resolved and J&amp;J and AZ vaccines are approved with ample, steady supply."
16141,The issue isn't always a lack of respect for elders.
16142,The issue is that our elders also have zero respect for the younger generations.
16143,"Litteraly people over 40 are a protected class, and yet we are entitled."
16144,"Please do not mistake a frustration with people who claim to be better because they worked hard (despite the fact that they had better opportunities), when even if we try it is still not enough."

16152,The last thing we need is schools opening up early though only to go back into shutdown

16182,Not strict at all.
16183,"Should’ve been arrested, it’s literally endangering potentially hundreds of people."
16184,Exactly 👉
16185,Then who will he blame?
16186,There won't be enough vaccine for months no matter what anyone does.
16187,This is all just political finger pointing.
16188,"&gt;  it is a roll of the dice

Yes, a roll with 99.999999% chance of success."
16189,"For the most part yes we are, none of this will be permanent."

16191,10 days from onset of symptoms with 24 hours no fever is the current recommendation.
16192,"Obesity is not what they mean by immunocompromised in this context

Positive tests due to dead, noninfectious viral material is possible for many weeks after infection and does not indicate infectiousness"

16195,Saying “hopefully” is more of a desire to see something occur then an order lol.

16212,Apparently people downvote if they hear about someone doing something they don't agree with.
16213,"Good for them, but what’s their strategy for reopening their borders?"
16214,They can’t stick with a zero covid strategy forever.
16215,"Even if you require vaccination to enter the country, some people will inevitably bring the virus there since there’s always that 5% of people the vaccine isn’t effective for."

16222,"Tomorrow, they could report 1.5 mil, but that wouldn't mean 1.5 mil were actually given, either."

16224,"Okay, but republicans are the racist ones"
16225,France have had some significant medical related scandals over the years that have resulted in a high level of cynicism towards pharmaceutical companies and the government.

16231,mRNA is a molecule containing instructions for cells to produce a certain protein.
16232,"Being alien to the immune system, the protein will elicit an immune response which boosts body's ability to neutralize attacks by similar proteins."
16233,You can use your favorite categorization system to define this technology.
16234,It depends how you count.
16235,It's around 24 if you take all 9 million people.
16236,"But if you exclude 2 million people that are under 16 years old and people that already had been infected, it's around 30 percent"
16237,It’s funny how you assume anyone against the obviously staged pandemic is automatically American.
16238,"&gt; Sounds like 2nd dose is very important

I don't think you can say that based on the data."
16239,Rise in the antibodies suggests the first dose worked and immune system is responding to the second dose as it would to the virus.
16240,(Getting infected also causes rise in antibodies since they are created when needed.)
16241,Delaying is reasonable.
16242,Here is an explanation from RNA virologist: https://mobile.twitter.com/wanderer_jasnah/status/1345422670477873152
16243,do you know where Pfizer's  Global Research and Development Center for Vaccines is?
16244,they have manufacturing capability [there](https://www.pfizer.com/science/research-development/centers/ny_pearl_river) too.
16245,"Well to start the fatality rate is not that much different, within about 6% of the US as a whole."
16246,Open bars and clubs increases transmission of the virus but not necessarily deaths.
16247,"Not everyone that gets it dies, and the deaths are very, very heavily concentrated in the elderly with pre-existing conditions."
16248,Those are probably not the people going to bars and clubs.
16249,Also how you find the cases matters.
16250,If you are testing a bunch of young healthy people you are going to find a bunch of positive cases that don't turn into fatalities.
16251,If you test people at nursing homes it'll be the opposite.

16259,"No, I do not lack empathy."

16262,Your ignorance is ludacris.
16263,I understand that.
16264,All I'm saying is the roll out was going bad before this report and this report shows no signs of improvement.
16265,I expected this as well.
16266,"It's also why people saying stuff like ""once we get the over 60s and vulnerable done, covid is over!"""

16275,I don’t think they gotten any approvals for anything under 16.
16276,Elementary age kids (in the us) likely won’t have a vaccine by august if this continues.
16277,No wonder the US is a shit show rn when we have people as dumb as you
16278,If you are young and want to rot your brain sure go to Florida and Arizona.
16279,They are known for attracting dumb people.
16280,"&gt;That's no how this works

That is going to change."
16281,"I'm on the epi / stats / public health side so not such an expert in that, sorry: but I think the AZ trial includes regular PCR testing in all subjects (rather than just symptomatic people,) so it will give us some information on interruption of infection."
16282,"Transmission is harder still to study, evidence may not be direct/population based."
16283,"Yes, we know, now can we get some in our arms already?"
16284,"Yea I’d consider mere months to be “nearing” the end

Warmer weather + vaccine + natural immunity from prior infections 

It will get better"
16285,"""It's a holiday and reporting is predictably thin/light."

16292,I believe they've announced that more will arrive in less than 2 weeks.
16293,"Hopefully, if all goes as planned, every essential personnel aged 20+ would be vaccinated by April."
16294,"So if we had more intellectualism, all the closed businesses would voluntarily close on their own?"
16295,I am advocating for protecting my family in the absence of the government doing so.

16297,I don’t know why people *want* reinfection to be worse
16298,"Our leadership is strong, stable , smart and thats why people choose in it for almost 15 Years.."
16299,"The covid crisis was hard everywhere and each country dealt with it for the first timem there is no perfect but should not be ashamed to say yes, we got vaccines first, lockdowns when needed and strong economy."
16300,Ok you pedant.
16301,"Saying ""I'm sorry that happened to you"" shows empathy."
16302,You clearly lack it.
16303,Move on.
16304,Well hopefully you listen.
16305,No.
16306,The US has been doing a terrible job of strain surveillance and it's playing catch up.
16307,It can't say anything definitive about these strains because the lack weeks and months of surveillance data that the NHS did as a matter of course.
16308,It's only fearmongering because the utter incompetence of political and public health authorities across the country.
16309,We can’t afford to not be cautious.
16310,Anti-intellectualism is alarming prevalent even without valid evidence.
16311,Can you imagine if they had an actual controversy to whip people up around?
16312,If you want to destroy the tourism industry and ban all international travel for decades then you can eradicate it.

it seems that this variant was detected by RT-PCR tests and that it has 6 of the 17 mutations of the British B.1.1.7 variant."
16320,"In particular, it has the H69/V70 deletions already known from the Danish mink variant."

16330,Cause it really sounds like you don't.

16354,"Biden's administration will most likely handle this better than Trump and his COVID team and he will be using the defense production act to help boost production, which will help a lot."
16355,The vaccines are owned by private companies who are not going to invest a ton of money on production that will be useless in less than a year.
16356,"Same issue happened with the N95 masks, 3M wasn't going to build a bunch more production facilities and hire a bunch more people only to not have use for them once people got vaccinated."
16357,That's where the defense production act helps.

16429,We have no good leaders anywhere.
16430,But there’s a deeper problem that 2020 exposed.
16431,It’s not just the “leaders”.
16432,It’s the people.
16433,"“Now, there's one thing you might have noticed I don't complain about: politicians."
16434,Everybody complains about politicians.
16435,Everybody says they suck.
16436,"Well, where do people think these politicians come from?"
16437,They don't fall out of the sky.
16438,They don't pass through a membrane from another reality.
16439,"They come from American parents and American families, American homes, American schools, American churches, American businesses and American universities, and they are elected by American citizens."

16451,The case number being higher than the number of documented cases is literally the case for every single nation in the world.
16452,When positivity rates surpass 10% thats the point at which the number of cases are expected to be drastically higher than the documented number.
16453,Japan has spent very little time above a 10% positivity rating in the past year.
16454,We can't fuck around with this disease.
16455,Weaker vaccines mean it's more likely to mutate and find a way to defeat the vaccines entirely.
16456,We should go with a two dose regime if that's proven to be significantly better even if it means that it takes a little more time to vaccinate everyone.
16457,We need to trust the science and not get so excited about the possibility of opening a little sooner that we make mistakes which will come back to bite us in the ass.
16458,My Dad was living in a small rural county in Washington that had until recently very few cases.
16459,"He was skeptical the virus was a real problem, said he didn't know anyone who had caught it."
16460,He mostly felt that way because he hates being forced to stay home and not socialize.
16461,"Well, he moved to small county in California to be close to his family and be able to socialize."
16462,"Yep, you guessed it, he has covid now..."
16463,It's hard for people to look at examples from other people's experiences and then make the decision to act accordingly.
16464,"Until it starts to hit them hard, they will continue to live in denial."
16465,yet they have time to give out jaywalking tickets or do drunk driving checkpoints?
16466,Let's be realistic.
16467,In many states the police have said flat out they will not enforce masking ordinances.
16468,They have said it's a public health problem and doesn't involve criminal intent.
16469,No?
16470,Just restrict travel from places with active community spread.
16471,"If you are from somewhere with active spread and are not vaccinated, sorry no travel without quarantine."
16472,Its very simple.
16473,Several countries have eradicated their domestic case load.
16474,"It isn't hard, and with vaccines it will get that much easier."
16475,Those countries who decide to not even do the bare minimum _should_ feel excluded from normal travel as they are disgusting petri dishes for this pandemic to continue.
16476,I thought it was the Trump administration's plan to dole out more vaccine to states who are vaccinating more efficiently?
16477,&gt; This.
16478,"If they actually had an impact on spread, we would know by now."
16479,"No, we wouldn't."
16480,The variants still make up a very small proportion of total particles sequenced.
16481,"If they were more prevalent, you'd expect to see a majority of sequences be made up of the new variants."
16482,Whether they're 50-60% more transmissible has little impact in the overall case numbers.
16483,The WHO had 2 billion dollars to help poor countries get the covid vaccine... what happened?
16484,"While I do hope that the vaccine is approved for children, I don't understand how you can come to this conclusion."
16485,"Even the highest hospitalization rate mentioned, at 33.7 per 100,000 is quite rare."
16486,Oof!
16487,I heard many coworkers have side effects like that for about a day.
16488,How long til you felt back to normal?
16489,And yes!!!
16490,I’d take 24-48 hours of an immune response over covid hands down
16491,That’s why I’m so bloody glad I participated in the trial.
16492,I either got the shots in the fall or will be getting them by March (depending if I got placebo in the fall).
16493,"I’ve been taking this seriously, I’ll continue to be considerate, but I also want to start dating again and see my family."
16494,Ain’t seen them face to face in over a year.
16495,Knowing I’m protected will make me much more comfortable with doing that.
16496,I pray Biden’s administration can figure this shit out.
16497,They should make the polio eradication campaign look like child’s play.
16498,"All guns blazing, shots in arms, go go go."
16499,The sooner we get a critical mass vaccinated the sooner we can safely get back to normal.
16500,"They’ve not studied the South African variant enough to be that dramatic, but it’s definitely not looking good right now with the initial assessment."
16501,There’s a lot of transmission and a lot of chances for the virus to respond to pressures and evolve out of vaccine effectiveness.
16502,"no one enjoys structural racism, but why loot stores and burn down buildings?"
16503,At least 30% have been infected so far according to the CDC (91 million by December 2020): https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/cases-updates/burden.html
16504,"Honestly, I hope so."
16505,Fauci has been consistent in saying people in the US will likely have to keep wearing masks and social distancing until herd immunity is reached.

16585,"They can't know immunity lasts for years for SARS-COV-2 yet, but they have had enough time to show how quickly the naturally developed antibodies dwindle, and how well memory bcells work beyond that (so far), since it appears for most people the antibodies only last around 5 months."
16586,"All coronaviruses are different in how they affect our immune systems, some on average only produce antibodies that remain present and effective for around 8 months, some for up to 2 years."
16587,Just because there's a coronavirus that confers 2 years worth of effective antibodies does not mean SARS-COV-2 does as well.
16588,In fact it clearly doesn't.
16589,What I worry about is what happens when we've vaccinated a good percentage of the elderly and the deaths start to drop.
16590,"Once the numbers aren't so scary, I think a lot of young people are just going to go back to normal, vaccine or no."
16591,We need more research on the long-term effects of this disease.

16669,I've wondered this too.
16670,My best guess is that they have concerns over how the vaccine was rushed and aren't overall anti-vax.

16742,Fancy clubs can enforce dress codes as far as I understand.

So yeah, you sound that dumb."
16747,MAYBE you're just into something.
16748,What is disputable?
16749,It’s a fact that the study didn’t find any evidence saying vaccines helped kill older people.

16767,I'm from BC where cases are pretty bad but currently living in South Korea.
16768,I made the mistake of not being specifically optimistic.
16769,I don't feel like we are looking down the barrel of another post 9/11-like change in security.
16770,But change will be the result.
16771,Just like in previous pandemics.
16772,We will live our lives differently.
16773,But that is ok. You don't need to take a dystopian view when considering this.
16774,Too lazy to spend time citing it - but Azar and operation warp speed team said not too long ago that they believe ~40% of US population will be “immune” by end of January.
16775,It’s a bit of voodoo but the assumption is we are only measuring 1/2-1/4 the total number of cases.
16776,"Many are mild (“probably just allergies”) or asymptomatic (kids especially) and the complete failure to test during NY,New Orleans, early outbreaks etc."
16777,has screwed our true case count permanently.
16778,So basically around 30% of population have exposure and we will get to nearly 30 million vaccinated this month if things keep going.
16779,"That’s about 40% immunity (obviously some overlap, people that have had it have a right to a vaccine as well) but overall we are creeping up there."
16780,"States like ND,WV, are the canaries in the coal mine on if this is actually true."

16784,This news article makes it seem that he never got the virus.
16785,"But upon reading it further, it more or less affirms it yet they still ask how they got the virus when the only one, at that time, who had interaction with strangers on a daily basis was the guy who got the vaccine."
16786,"Either way, fingers crossed."
16787,"The average is 17/100,000 children hospitalized."

16797,"The real question is if he thought it was worth it, can you elaborate on that?"
16798,"I got COVID when I was seeing my friends in Chicago and I thought it was worth it, way better than staying in my house all day losing my damn mind."

16801,Like what decisions did he make?
16802,"By mid March, he closed everything down."
16803,I know this because i live in NY and my gf is a teacher at a public school in brooklyn.
16804,Italy was hit hard by mid-March.
16805,We never saw their peak death until the last days of March at close to 1k.
16806,"Even then, the US as a whole was getting hit worse than Italy(we had greater numbers of cases and deaths) but we are a larger nation."
16807,"By the beginning of second week of April, we were hitting our peak of 1K deaths."
16808,"So, our cases and Italy's happened simultaneously."
16809,"By early March, which is when we were beginning to see Italy had deaths in the 50's."
16810,NY had half of that.
16811,It didn't look too serious until you started seeing triple digits overnight.
16812,People were catching it in February and going to the hospital in March getting intubated and delaying their death.
16813,Italy and NY had almost the same timeline.
16814,"Encountered more stoners when I was working at a nursing home than anywhere else, wouldn't be surprised"
16815,"Not all, but say 90% of the failure in US."
16816,[removed]
16817,Depends.

16827,Kids don't need to take time off to recover from COVID for the most part.
16828,It's just the sniffles for them.
16829,Go back to the old practice of letting kids study despite showing symptoms.
16830,Trader Joe’s is my top pick but I don’t shop anywhere.
16831,I’m be back.
16832,"In less than the time she spent arguing, she could have put in a mask, bought groceries, checked out, and be on her way home."
16833,But nope.
16834,Apparently arguing is a better option.
16835,Exactly!!
16836,"If an asymptotic kiddo can get cardiac damage or nerve damage, or who knows what, it’s my job to keep them safe."
16837,"Then people say, “don’t live in fear”."
16838,I don’t.
16839,At all.
16840,I just want them safe.
16841,Plus these new strains can impact children more than the original strain.
16842,I will take the inconvenience any day to know they’re okay.

16846,"I'm on day 12, feeling good the last 2 days."
16847,Hope it sticks!
16848,"Even if the kids aren’t dying from it, outbreaks at schools would still be a problem, since you’d end up having huge chunks of the student body out of school for a couple weeks while they recover."
16849,"Vast majority of kids will survive, but it’s still an illness that could be a huge inconvenience for schools"
16850,Unfortunately this is a situation where the idiots are killing the people who take it seriously as well as each other....
16851,Sub-100k in 3-4 weeks?
16852,That would be nice but I highly doubt it.

17025,"Yeah, I felt better after about a week of cold symptoms, then the next day I had what felt like hot flashes (I'm 34f), then just felt really fatigued with brain fog the next 2 days, then upset stomach if I ate anything not bland for a couple days."

17048,"And I assure you it will,"
17049,"They say that Australia is the best state in the U.S., already."
17050,Damn spring and summer is gonna be looking real nice 😉
17051,"USA hospital census, which is not usually affected by holidays, is down 5% week over week, same as the last few days."
17052,"123,848 people hospitalized with covid is down 7% from the peak on Jan. 6 and and is the lowest number since Jan. 2."
17053,"I am hopeful that once vaccines targeting vulnerable populations begin to see an effect, hospitalizations will drop even faster than cases."
17054,"Actually, by the time you are due to get your second dose (about a month in) you already probably have 80-90% protection."
17055,The second dose is just a booster mainly for longevity.
17056,The first dose is pretty damn effective if you wait a month.
17057,That’s one of the reasons they have considered not saving the second doses for the same people other than that more and more vaccines will always be coming.
17058,"It’s just that both Pfizer and Moderna were tested with two doses, so that’s why the protocol is to stick with two."
17059,They’re damn good vaccines.
17060,Edited to add: but yes you can still get Covid right after you get the first dose.
17061,You need to wait a while but it’s still really effective with the first dose after a month.
17062,so they suspend the vaccine in miralax?
17063,What?
17064,Go one by one with the states.
17065,Which state population going to be the ones to be 50th in line and who going to break the news to them?
17066,You have it backwards.
17067,"If an EU country wants to close its borders (or do anything really), then it can just do that."
17068,For example Poland and Hungary are busily dismantling democracy and the rule of law - it is going to take a lot of effort at the EU level to put a stop to that.

17074,How many people in your office?
17075,"As a rule of thumb, divide by five to get the number of people in your office who believe something like ""Covid is mostly spread through tank wagons carrying the virus to the hotspots on government orders"" and ""vaccinations are a plan of the government and Bill Gates to chip you""."

17090,So what does socializing at work have to do with work-life balance?

17097,"If you measure immunity solely in terms of antibody presence, you’re doing it wrong."
17098,Why are we presuming that SARS-CoV-2 operates differently in this regard than other viruses?
17099,"No, Andrew."
17100,*You're* a fraud.
17101,It hasn't been fully established that it's 50% more contagious.
17102,That's an early estimate with a wide error bar.
17103,"Some of the bigger, more recent studies put it closer to 30%."
17104,"But it appears to mean that if it gets into your body, it's better at infecting you."
17105,It appears to be slightly more efficient at penetrating the receptors in the cell.
17106,"It's too early to say for certain that it does or does not change recommendations for specific activities, but I would be very surprised if safe outdoor activities became unsafe."
17107,That's the best damn news I've heard today.

17124,Wouldn't the body's response be similar if were infected by the virus around the same time as the 2nd dose?
17125,The body would see similar spike proteins from the actual virus and have a similar response.
17126,huh.

17158,Even someone who is 55 is 8 times more likely to die than a 30-year-old.
17159,"The best way to prioritize vaccinations is through age, because it's easy to verify and has such a significant impact on the death rate and hospitalization rate, which are the most important aspects of this disease."
17160,Sounds like you need to find a better job it socializing with coworkers is so damn terrible.
17161,"Tell that to the antimaskers and covid deniers, as they're the ones responsible."
17162,Anyone who thinks that governments ordering a lockdown are doing so to ruin people's lives or to malicious in regards to the pandemic is insane and stupid.

17269,"Here’s a more recent analysis:

&gt;Given that the patient from whom many of the antibodies in the current study were obtained did not develop severe COVID-19, and the lack of correspondence between ADE in vitro and in vivo, the researchers concluded, “These results suggest that antibody-induced enhancement of infection is a rare possibility but will not likely be a biologically relevant adverse effect following COVID-19 vaccination in humans.”

17270,After not smoking for years.. Not gonna lie I started again after the pandemic bit.
17271,100 MM vaccination means 50 MM vaccinated in 100 days.
17272,Let's add 15 MM already vaccinated that is still just less than 1/5th of the USA or under 20% by end of April.
17273,"I can, you and others here are posting baseless partisan attacks (Cuomo is just doing this to make Trump look bad and as soon as Biden is in office, he'll do a 180) and getting tons of upvotes for it."
17274,"You also post in Conservative so I'm not wrong that there is obviously a political motivation behind these comments, not objective observations."
17275,"I live in NY, not a fan of Cuomo overall and haven't been for years but my point stands."
17276,I'm a little confused.
17277,"I see that  over 330,000 doses were distributed, but not how many of those were administered?"
17278,Concerning nonetheless.
17279,so what are you suggesting the tourism industry and international travel be restricted or banned for decades?
17280,Thats totally unfeasible
17281,Mind if I link to this in a post about staying positive and all the good news about vaccines?
17282,It’s also worth noting that the risk for the immunocompromised drops dramatically as more people are vaccinated.
17283,The virus can’t propagate in a community as easily if most people are vaccinated.
17284,This is literally the point of the concept of herd immunity and why it’s infuriating that antivax dipshits have caused outbreaks of stuff like measles.
17285,[removed]
17286,It's a massive Type 2 error.
17287,False negative.
17288,"Most countries and the WHO did not want to believe it could happen, so that couldn't be what they were looking at."
17289,"Normally institutions are worried about a Type 1 error - false positive, false alarm."
17290,"However, pandemic threat viruses are not rare."
17291,We have had six serious threats *we know about* since 2003.
17292,"One was suppressed (SARS 2003), three haven't become efficient enough (H5N1, H7N9, MERS), and two went worldwide (2009 H1N1, COVID)."
17293,There are many other potential threats a tier down.
17294,2009 H1N1 happened to be mild but the real takeaway should have been how fast a pandemic flu-like illness will move.
17295,There is a substantial chance of the alarm being real.
17296,&gt;in any way that’s under my control.
17297,This is the key part for me that makes it seem much more reasonable than the other people who make posts with the same sentiment.
17298,"It seems like asymptomatic spread is mostly not a thing, but presymptomatic spread is very much a thing."
17299,So the case for masks &amp; restrictions on those who aren't sick is still strong.
17300,"I'm social as fuck, use to go out every weekend."
17301,Ever since this started I haven't been out ONCE.. why?
17302,because I'm not a selfish piece of shit who jeopardizes those around him.
17303,"That's a good reason, a good explanation and it deserves sympathy."
17304,However with respect it's still not valid as an excuse
17305,It's just trying to live its life and make receptors meet..
17306,Yea.
17307,I mean I was all for watching Cuomo’s daily press conferences in the spring but over the summer and the fall they seem to have morphed into more of trump bashings than actually informative press conferences.
17308,And believe me I am not trying to make the case trump was perfect in all this.
17309,He definitely has his own issues too.
17310,Suit yourself
17311,I had quite a few side effects from the second dose.
17312,"Headache, 101 degree fever, chills, fatigue, muscle aches, racing heartbeat."
17313,Still better than having covid though!
17314,A vaccine wouldn’t cause symptoms like this right?
17315,"Sorry, babies, but ""didn't know I mustn't drive over the limit"" won't get you out of a speeding ticket either."
17316,This is gonna be a weird take.

17320,People forgives George’s Floyd.
17321,"Why not this man, sir?"
17322,The two biggest missteps  in every single country was not cutting off international travel all together immediately and not having mass testing WITHOUT symptoms from the start.
17323,We would have a much smaller problem and far more data if that had occurred.
17324,This subreddit is all about fear!

17329,Now that it's cold and there's none of these activities happening... Way less cases.
17330,I can see things going back up once the weather gets warmer and if vaccination continues to be a failure.
17331,Sounds like you can't handle the politicians on your side being criticized.
17332,I remember chatting with some coworkers in January about it.
17333,I recall wondering why other countries didn't take it too seriously.
17334,Granted-countries outside of Asia treated it like SARS and claimed it could never happen in their own home countries.

17347,"The problem is, most of our policies are based on fear of asymptomatic spread, which studies do indicate is mostly not a thing, but **admitting** that obviously wipes out the entire case for masks &amp; restrictions on those of us who aren’t sick."
17348,"So, we are left in a confusing spot."
17349,I mean honestly the appointments for the second doses should be made when the first is administered but I doubt that is happening.
17350,Regardless there should be at least a record of how many first shots were administered 21 days ago at vaccination sites.
17351,It should be trivial to project how many doses you need for the 2nd doses weeks in advance.
17352,"The problem is that while Cuomo is good at making threats about the stiff penalties for those that circumvent the distribution protocols, I don't see how they enforce anything with the distribution network expanding."
17353,"A local K-mart pharmacy had vaccines according to a vaccination finder portal, never answered the phone when I was trying to get an appointment for my elderly parent."
17354,"Appointment dates are ""filled"" on appointment websites before they even go public."
17355,100% I'm convinced many distribution sites are doing whatever they want.
17356,"It is to the point where the average person will just have to resign themselves to just waiting for everyone with a ""hook-up"" to get their doses and then maaaaybe we can get a vaccine."
17357,"At this rate it will be spring before they can move past 65+, education workers, firefighters, first responders, police, transit workers and anyone else lucky enough to have a job with a union and political clout."
17358,Oh well.
17359,Just don't get sick I guess.
17360,"I think he did well with handling the pandemic side of things, but this vaccine rollout isn't great."
17361,There is no reason why appointments couldn't have been made before vaccines were even shipped out.
17362,No reason at all.
17363,Otherwise you are just begging for people to be crooked or just incompetent.
17364,Which is what is going on now.
17365,I find the picture in the thumbnail of this to be curious.
17366,They have a bunch of tables that seat 5.
17367,So they put one on each end of one table.
17368,Just one in the middle of the next table.
17369,"Then back to the sides, etc."
17370,That all makes sense.
17371,"But then for each column of tables, the people on the end line up with each other and the two ends of two tables next to each other aren't that far."
17372,I feel like it would be better to at least stagger those as well.
17373,Or spread the tables out more.
17374,You just mentioned two countries that suffer the tons of backlash from the EU.
17375,Also the EU denied the border closing policy within the EU.
17376,"Not for the world outside of the EU* no EU country has dared to defy that and gone ""impune""."
17377,Not that the EU can really do much to said countries.
17378,Portugal for the EU is the Competitor of China.
17379,They get good workers at very low pay.
17380,"This sort of goes to say that Portugal is basically an EU peon, unlike the other countries you mentioned that defy EU's sovereignty."
17381,"I'm usually so optimistic, but I noticed that in Illinois, the hospitalizations were dropping at about the same pace as the number of deaths each day."
17382,"Someone tried to reason with me about how it's not just body bags leaving the hospital, and clearly they're right, but damn, that moment of realization was pretty harsh."
17383,Can't get those vaccines in arms quickly enough!
17384,Let's go!

17395,&gt;California state epidemiologist Dr. Erica Pan issued a statement Sunday recommending providers pause the administration of lot 041L20A of the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine due to possible allergic reactions that are being investigated.

17407,People all the time get all bent out of shape over research studies.
17408,You know research studies can be wrong right?
17409,In fact research studies tend to be more wrong then right most of the time.
17410,Studies need to be verified before you can put any weight on them.
17411,The study needs to be repeated several times by at least one other group to prove the study is correct.
17412,Most of the time studies fail the verification process because they skipped an important step in the original study therefore invalidating the study.
17413,The point is just because a study says XYZ doesn't mean it's true or isn't littered with false claims.
17414,Remember the study the government did on weed decades ago?
17415,They deemed weed unsafe because they stuck some monkies in a room filled with smoked  and they died.
17416,They died because they ran out of oxygen and so the study declared weed an dangerous.
17417,Kind of bull shit right?
17418,Studies are done all the time like this.
17419,Until a research study had been verified don't put much weight on it.

17472,A lot..... That's why I'm not that concerned about the lack of uptake with this vaccine.
17473,Figure most who were asymptomatic will take it and most who were symptomatic won't.
17474,This is exactly why I think pandemic will be over much sooner than projections indicate right now.
17475,Different Aldi's.
17476,Trader Joe's is not connected to the American Aldi chain.
17477,Wow I'd assume there would be an HEB everywhere like how it is here in San Antonio.
17478,"I love WinCo, there aren't any of those here."
17479,"Any resources for effectiveness ratings of 7 vs 10 vs 14 day quarantines, following the guidelines for each length?"
17480,Give the vaccine time to take effect.
17481,Most people only got their first dose a couple of weeks ago.
17482,"You could give people a hundred doses and it wouldn't help them one bit if they got infected within a couple of days, or if they were already infected (and pre-symptomatic) before they were vaccinated at all."
17483,"Israel has had one of the worst outbreaks in the world over the New Year period, and cases only start to come down about 12 days after getting vaccinated (bear in mind the incubation period here)."
17484,It was inevitable that a lot of people were going to turn up positive soon after getting their first dose.
17485,"This is going to be the problem the world over tho, people will think it’s a magic bullet and cease taking precautions."
17486,"If everyone adhered to the advice, this pandemic would be over quicker, but they won’t."

17489,If you are in a line of work where the employer is actually forced to treat you like a human being because you are so in-demand it’s pretty great.
17490,You can leave to run an errand in the middle of the day and not have to worry about clocking in or out.
17491,Basically the only widespread profession that’s like this in America is software engineering though.

17494,I have a co-worker whose mom tested positive in the summer and then again around Christmas.
17495,I think the reinfection rate is very low but with how widespread this thing is we are going to have tons of cases where people get it twice.
17496,I also have some underwears laying around.
17497,I'll send some.

You don't honestly know this."
17502,Stop saying this.
17503,You have no idea the future ramifications it may have on their body.
17504,Simply being asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic to the primary infection means nothing to the overall effect it can have on a person.
17505,The number of whites in Leopold’s Congo was never more then around 3000 to get to your claimed number every white man would have to personally kill like four and a half thousand Africans

17511,"So you want to massively vaccine everyone in your country and open up back to ""normal"" in 2-4 months, or share your vaccines with the world and hope that the job is done within a year at best."

17513,Smh.
17514,"TBH, isn't it speculated that US intelligence agencies knew of a circulating virus in China before Beijing did?"
17515,I struggle to imagine how the central government in Beijing could or would want to act with sufficient speed and bureaucratic agility to coverup a tiny novel outbreak that at the time did not look much different from countless other common diseases (like the flu).
17516,"It was likely the provincial government calling the shots, and if my experience with local governments in my own country is anything to go by, local governments tend to hide things that would otherwise have the central government come down on them like a sack of bricks."

17577,I've been vaccinated for polio and tetanus.

Imo Gottlieb is cueing the financial markets to lower expectations and back out of their financial positions in Pfizer and Moderna."
17777,He spent quarters 3 &amp; 4 of 2020 on his ICE podcast (ICE is a financial industry platform and works with NYSE) talking up the stocks indirectly.
17778,He is on the board at Pfizer.
17779,He’s the former FDA chief that quit in May 2020 to take this lucrative position.
17780,(Think about that btw ).
17781,"Now, IMO, he’s going to be held accountable by the financial industry that likely relied on him, a big shot former FDA chief, so he’s indirectly telling everyone to cut losses."
17782,People are going to lose money and Gottlieb is likely covering himself.
17783,"Imo Gottlieb, and his fellow Pfizer board members, the Wall Street investors to which he markets his podcast,  grossly underestimated the intelligence of many people."
17784,"I think very few that show no Interest in the Pfizer or Moderna vaccines are against vaccines, in general."
17785,"And given the gravity of Covid relative to flu, there’s no comparing the data."
17786,"Many will take the risk with flu, and opt out of the vaccines, but will eagerly accept a safe, effective proven vaccine for Covid."
17787,I certainly will!
17788,No question.
17789,"It’s not about vaccine fear, it’s about mRNA."
17790,Safe and effective are the keys.
17791,The last thing we need is another health problem in 2021.
17792,I think many are  delaying vaccination because the Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna vaccines are mRNA vaccines Without a proven record for safety or reliability.
17793,"Many are willing to continue to isolate and wait for a safe, effective alternative from Johnson &amp; Johnson or Oxford/az."
17794,And frankly the data they’ve released is missing vital information that would give people more confidence.
17795,"It’s on them for not marketing it proper and just assuming we’d trust unsupported conclusions after being mislead by agencies like the CDC who spent months even discouraging mask use, questioned the airborne nature, etc."
17796,If it is safe and effective then they could’ve establish that by publishing detailed data to reassure people.
17797,"For instance, why didn’t they conduct weekly Covid-19 tests of all subjects as did Oxford?"
17798,Why did they only test symptomatic subjects to determine the efficacy rate of their mRNA ?
17799,How did they determine if someone was symptomatic?
17800,"Also, what was count of  the neutralizing antibodies,  the geometric mean titer, after day 29?"
17801,Day 57?
17802,After the second dose ?
17803,J&amp;J provided this data.
17804,I can’t find it for Pfizer.
17805,Or Moderna.

17811,Herd immunity is only achievable via vaccination.
17812,"If you look at traditional herd immunity developed for livestock, you’d know that that form of herd immunity requires everything that will die to die."
17813,We can’t do that to human beings.
17814,The only way I see us getting to herd immunity here in the US is if the government or companies pay people to get the vaccine.
17815,There are just too many people who are even pro vax that have said they will skip this vaccine.
17816,There will have to be a financial incentive.
17817,"Yup that's what we need, less nurses"

17933,These countries have over bought supplies which they will then send to other countries.
17934,The reason they overbought is cause they want to guarantee the largest amount the quickest.
17935,"But by doing that, they've taken away vaccines from smaller countries that couldn't purchase them and will now have to wait until those larger countries finish their vaccinations and then send the supplies down to the smaller countries."
17936,"&amp;nbsp;

I can see the merits in both."
17937,"Just buying a regular allotment for everyone so everyone gets vaccinated at the same pace, more or less."
17938,"Or buy a lot to assure that ""*your*"" people get the vaccine first and then send them off to others."
17939,The leaders are there to help their country and this is a sideeffect.
17940,"&amp;nbsp;

for example, who's truly getting vaccinated now?"
17941,THere's only so many countries doing vaccinations while others have to wait until march/april/may/june to start.
17942,The reason is because the wealthier countries purchased up the allotments instead of leaving amounts for other countries.
17943,But thatt woulld mean less vaccines for the wealthy country.
17944,"&amp;nbsp;

Kind of how you'll see how the wealthy people in these countries will start to get vaccines first over the rest of the population."
17945,Its just happening at a country scale with vaccine distribution.
17946,1610 deaths.
17947,Equivalent to 7808 in the US.
17948,"Its going to get worse for at least the next week, i expect this to be broken a few more times its an absolute shit show here."

17953,Please tell me how this is selfish and irresponsible and I’ll retract what I said.
17954,"I’m not an anti-masker, however I haven’t seen any legitimate scientific studies that have said that wearing a mask / socially distancing even after you have gotten the vaccine is going to kill / infect others."
17955,"yes, things are getting better for sure."
17956,"the deaths will always follow the cases though, so we're in for a rough couple weeks"
17957,Cool but I'm pretty sure we have enough money being thrown at covid globally.
17958,There are some severely underfunded diseases out there too like tuberculosis...
17959,Currently to friendly countries only and not to hostile neighbouring countries.
17960,Every country would do that.
17961,The cases are reducing but the deaths are increasing  :(

17966,I don't think I'll ever stop wearing a mask after all of this.
17967,I use the subway system in NYC.
17968,"And, I am not setting foot in public transport unless I wear a mask."
17969,Even well after everyone is vaccinated and COVID surges are a thing of the past.
17970,"Also, I'll be avoiding crowded places as well for a good while; busy bars, movie theaters, packed restaurants, etc."
17971,"I'll be social and go out, but crowds - no thanks."
17972,COVID proved we just can't handle being clean... like at all.
17973,Imagine if we all cooperated when this virus 1st broke out?
17974,It would have been done with.
17975,"And, I am not talking about lock downs."
17976,The initial attempts were for limiting spacing and seating in public places like restaurants and bars.
17977,Nope - no one listened as the cases of COVID surged.
17978,People just don't want to cooperate.
17979,"So, I'll do whatever is best for me and my health."
17980,Good news tag?
17981,"Hey listen say what you want about standardized testing, but I got top 20th percentile which got me into a state school."
17982,And I say that because it sure wasn't my GPA.
17983,They seem to indicate a general aptitude and not specific knowledge.
17984,"You can make the same arguments for grades, they’re entirely subjective and aren’t a good comparison tool between students from different schools."
17985,"lol that's not what I said at all, you fuckwit."
17986,The damage has been done.
17987,It will take a year or two to get back to where we were.
17988,Getting people vaccinated will not magically speed up this year or two process.
17989,"Jesus, people like you blow my mind at how reactive and generally ignorant you are."
17990,Except you do realize the articles I am sourcing are FL based right?

17992,"Difference is while your beliefs are based on factless opinions, I have locally sourced articles talking about not only DeSantis is a real piece of shit, but his response to this pandemic is equally shitty."
17993,&gt;The WHO had a budget of $4.4B in 2019 which is less than some hospitals in the US.
17994,12 mill budget each day for a single hospital?
17995,what?
17996,"Even if the average person there get's 100$ an hour, and there are 24/7 1000 people working in that hospital , that is still only 2,4 million a day ... what the f am i missing here?"
17997,"Is this hospital like a big city, with 500000 patients or what?"
17998,What's sad and depressing is that all this actually preventable if people are not such idiots and selfish.
17999,This is not generally true.

18007,I work with someone who's had it twice.
18008,People can call that anecdotal as much as they want but I don't think reinfections are as unlikely as they say they are.
18009,That's why I got the vaccine as soon as I could even though I've already had covid.
18010,Okay...
18011,So fuck those kids is the position that you're taking?
18012,Wish I could upvote this 100 times.
18013,china as well
18014,Yep he was a major down player of it on Twitter
18015,It might be reasonable to be concerned.
18016,But then it's also time to find a new job.
18017,I'm honestly surprised these nursing homes aren't forcing them out for liability reasons.
18018,"The idea is that although deaths from suicides, ODs, etc will be up, deaths from things like car accidents will be down."
18019,At the same time other causes like cancer will likely stay the same.
18020,Other causes like maybe a heart attack victim who couldn’t get adequate/timely care because of covid strain may be added to the death toll when we look back and study the pandemic.
18021,"Either way it’s an estimate that shows quite clearly we are undercounting covid deaths, or were at one time, but doesn’t give a perfect number for how far off exactly we are."
18022,Exactly.
18023,First dose you’re supposed to act like you never got it.
18024,People think they’re invincible the instant the first dose of vaccine is injected in their arm.
18025,"It's fun we can finally talk about these topics without mentioning ""But the UK got an exemption ...""."
18026,120% is a figure of speech said to reporters to convey it is safe.
18027,Where exactly in their official report of Phase 1 and 2 does any of the crap you say recorded?
18028,"https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.12.11.20210419v1

&gt; Reactogenicity was absent in the majority of participants, with mild events."
18029,The majority of adverse events were mild and were resolved.
18030,"One serious adverse event was reported, which was found to be unrelated to vaccination."
18031,All three vaccine formulations resulted in robust immune responses comparable to a panel of convalescent serum.
18032,"Once again, please shut the hell up and don’t talk about things you have no clue about."
18033,"People like you have blood on your hands, convincing people not to get vaccinated."
18034,You should be ashamed.
18035,It is the Pfizer vaccine.
18036,"Tried to get my oldest into the clinic trial, but it filled up in less than a day."
18037,Testing should be done for 12-16 by March.
18038,What are sick days?
18039,We don't get any sick days and its only something I've heard of in the US.
18040,Can you just take them whenever you want even if you're not sick?
18041,Your sample is small and extremely fucking fortunate.
18042,Once again.
18043,You don’t have a clue.
18044,"Dude, it takes 12 days to develop antibodies."
18045,Stop being so dramatic about it.
18046,They haven’t been offered the vaccine.
18047,Good questions...
18048,I would have provided a link if I could have done.
18049,"I distinctly recall reading the paper within the past couple of days, but can no longer find it."
18050,"The cohort under 80 all had a strong immune response to infection, but of those above 80 7/15 failed to provide a response at all over the few days they were tested."
18051,"They had only had the first injection, and clearly the numbers were small."
18052,"I mention it because I was very surprised that the response was so bad, and it doesn't seem to be common knowledge - maybe it's plain wrong, I've not seen many results from the roll out of the vaccines, but of course quite a few references to people who have unfortunately died, with apparently some research showing no connection to the actual vaccine, or that the people were so frail that their immune response to the vaccine tipped them over the edge."
18053,Yeah that's my big question about the vaccine effectiveness calculation.
18054,Trial blinded participants are going to be way more careful than vaccinated general public so seems likely the effectiveness # will drop until covid becomes less prevalent.
18055,I am in the same boat.
18056,"Waited until I got vaxxed... Just got my second shot, plan on starting the gum in 2 weeks when I don’t have to worry about myself anymore."
18057,I’m already significantly more calm without the existential dred.
18058,"The quit is going to work, I know it!"

18064,‘Get the vaccine or you’re fired’.
18065,That’s the incentive at many companies and it seems like a great one.
18066,"Those are only meant to limit the spread of the virus so hospitals don't get overwhelmed, they are not meant to contain the virus."
18067,The honest answer is we aren't really sure.
18068,"It will be less than it is now, but by how much, we don't know."
18069,Not so fast.
18070,We are indoors more than ever now.
18071,And a lot of states are lifting some of the tighter restrictions.
18072,Probably best to ask that in the daily discussion thread.
18073,This is not an appropriate place for it
18074,I didn't know about this place till I moved to the South and my grandma told me about it lol she loves it... What do I need to get?

18080,This Week In Virology Clinical Update #45.
18081,Dr Griffin talks about the increase in deaths that is coming with these increasing numbers (i.e.
18082,"200,000+ positive cases a day)."
18083,The daily deaths of americans can be pretty easily googled.
18084,I know Aldi is a global chain but it's still a little bit weird to hear they're in America as well.
18085,people dumping links of reinfection stories like it's some kind of gotcha is wild when we've known for months that reinfection is *rare* and have never said it's impossible to get it twice.
18086,when you have 100 million probable cases just in the US that will lead to quite a few of them.
18087,"then you have people swearing they got it twice because they ""got really sick"" last February and then tested positive again in the fall."
18088,not everything is covid!
18089,!
18090,The only hostile country is Pakistan though.
18091,"Vaccines being sent to Bangladesh, Afghanistan, Nepal, Bhutan, Mongolia, Myanmmar, Oman, Phillipines, Srilanka."
18092,But that would classify every type of death that is higher than their mean as a covid death.
18093,"We are going to hit a record number of Suicides, Overdoses, etc."
18094,"I'm fully on board counting these as covid deaths since this are directly caused by the pandemic, the restrictions and thier effects"
18095,"Once numbers are at a tenth of where they are now, and once the over-55 crowd is largely vaccinated, there's no reason not to go back to normal."
18096,"but going to the doc is not even time off in many cases, at least for me doc time is on the clock, fully payed as long as I work at least 2 hours on that day."
18097,"In full day care cases, I can rely on one of my unlimited sick days :-)"
18098,"Sorry I mean from a changing standpoint, lawmakers, what you hear in tv, news, etc."
18099,My fiancée works at a hospital and got her second Pfizer shot 11 days ago.
18100,Her behavior at work has definitely changed in terms of being comfortable and not as worried when she walks in a room that is Covid positive.
18101,I can tell at home she’s less stressed and almost back to normal.
18102,"Of course there’s still the chance that she can pass it on to me, but at least half the battle is won."
18103,"I just need to wait a bit longer to get the shot (30, healthy male) and maybe I can get a sense of normalcy again."
18104,I would like them to give their data.
18105,"FDR was great despite his disability, not because of it"
18106,"Yeah, they are doing the vaccines pretty fast"
18107,"If the vaccine doesn't reduce transmission, why should anybody under 55 get it?"
18108,".... Because it almost certainly does reduce transmission, in fact there's [a story](https://old.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/l0a6jf/pfizer_vaccine_may_prevent_transmission_of/) on the front page of this sub right now that says it does."
18109,"It's time to put away the line that it doesn't reduce transmission, you're only feeding antivaxer sentiment, which will cost lives."
18110,Yes
18111,Let's remember that politicians promised a normal Christmas and didn't have the guts to backtrack.
18112,they determined it was 52% effective after a single dose from the trial.
18113,"Cool, so when can I get vaccinated?"
18114,All the appointments are for high-risk individuals.
18115,Last week it was usually about at 130 ET.
18116," I went to the hospital with my brother to get tested, he tested positive and I tested negative."

18118,My grandma got her first dose yesterday!
18119,People need to wait 2 weeks after the 2nd shot before going out.
18120,"&gt;Even if you are 80, the odds that you die in any two week period unless critically ill are minimal."
18121,Can you go ahead and provide the average life expectancy for someone ~80 with one or more comorbidity?
18122,&gt;COVID deaths are from COVID.
18123,There's no debate about this outside moonbat conspiracy theories.
18124,That's not what the CDC says.
18125,"~94% of deaths have one or more comorbidity, meaning something else was wrong with them on addition to a positive covid test."
18126,~6% have covid as the single source
18127,What about all those traditional Valentine's day orgies?
18128,What?
18129,Maybe that's just me.
18130,Especially the UK.
18131,They’ve done a outstanding job!
18132,"Im very high covid areas where people are dying due to substandard care, the optimal methods are less important than reducing hospitalkzation even a little bit."
18133,"Getting the peak down is key right now in much of the world, if we we get more infections in the months ahead as a result, it's not a big deal because we'll hopefully have the medical capacity to deal with it better."
18134,"And if we need to revaccinate in a few months, that's fine too because we'll be getting way more doses."
18135,That's lame
18136,Go away!

18141,That is just not true.
18142,"Here is the WHO policy advice from 24 February:

""Recommendations for international traffic

WHO continues to advise against the application of travel or trade restrictions to countries experiencing COVID-19 outbreaks."
18143,"In general, evidence shows that restricting the movement of people and goods during public health emergencies is ineffective in most situations and may divert resources from other interventions."""
18144,And this advice never actually changed.
18145,"In June, there was a WHO on ""reopening international transport""."
18146,"Sorry, but the WHO has been consistently behind events."
18147,"They were mostly ignored and sidelined, because their advice was mostly useless, and in retrospect, plain wrong."
18148,"My country told restaurants and hotels that they can open in May, so I expect other european countries to do the same"

18152,"They're pausing what is normally happy/exciting times to recognize the incredible scale and agony that the country had gone through thus far, without really reflecting on it."
18153,"It is being done to hopefully help return feeling to those numbed by the numbers and those who cannot visualize hundreds of thousands (which is most) and to help combat Covid fatigue, which will hopefully saves by encouraging more thoughtful behavior."
18154,Someone didn't enjoy their Flintstones vitamins
18155,Shut up dumb bot

18174,Isn't the new strain affecting kids more?
18175,The surprise would be that they are finding that it’s less than 52% effective(or whatever it was).
18176,Whether that’s because it just isn’t as effective as they thought or because people are being way too careless after the 1st dose and treating it like immediate full immunity is the question.
18177,The good news is that the 2nd dose so far does appear to be as effective as it’s supposed to be.
18178,Things will probably open after a certain rate of vaccinations
18179,Yup.
18180,Regular flu is a heavy hitter almost regardless of age.
18181,Parents can’t admit children to hospitals.
18182,"Doctors admit patients, so that does not make any sense."
18183,Your first point about exaggerated reporting might be correct.
18184,"I'm not watching the studies that closely, but it's definitely plausible that we could have approval for children before we get to the ""Whoever wants it can have it"" phase."
18185,When do they release vaccination stats for today?

18190,Hmmm...67+16= 83%...what is the remaining 17%?
18191,"So from say an Rt of 1.25 to about .4, or is it a bit more complex?"
18192,"Yeah, on Rogen’s podcast among other things he said that he had 7,000 employees in China and none of them died so he knew it wasn’t that serious."
18193,Meanwhile like or hate China they did keep a lot of their people from getting Covid.
18194,I love it how at this point my friend in Shanghai knows like 3 people who have had Covid since the start of the pandemic.
18195,While me living in a suburb of Pittsburgh I know at least 60 who have had Covid in the past month (and a crap ton more since the beginning)
18196,They found that kids represent less than 2% of hospitalization cases.
18197,"If they are that underrepresented relative to their make up of the population, it is safe to say that there is very little risk for that group."
18198,Thousands in a population of hundreds of millions is not significant.
18199,I’d rather be poor
18200,we have in Norway 500 covid deaths in one year the vaccination is started 2 weeks ago and a view days back we have already 23 deaths from it.
18201,The vaccine isn't injected into your lungs.

18206,I actually didn’t even leave my apartment for two months and still got sick.
18207,I had all of my groceries delivered.

18210,But how do you know that?
18211,How do you know there will be a different strain that won’t work against current vaccines?
18212,It’s so likely given how bad transmission is in the US right now

18216,How about not fucking back to the place with the highest risk population?
18217,Kinda like how they started doing after they realized they were just murdering elderly.
18218,Is it though?
18219,Look at dr Eric Feigl's Twitter.
18220,They tested the e484 variant on recovered people's sera.
18221,50% had no response to the variant and 90% had great reduction in response.
18222,"https://twitter.com/DrEricDing/status/1351282325926146048?s=20

Lower neutralization to the b117 variant was also found."
18223,The way I understand it the virus is very “sticky” and sticks to any ACE2 receptors near it.
18224,"So it should be extremely rare to breathe the virus in, then exhale it back out like cigarette smoke."
18225,If you shed virus then more than like it’s replicating in your cells because that would probably create a bunch more virus and also expel it in a way that it’s caught in droplets heading out of the body.
18226,Disclaimer: this is all my personal uninformed opinion and not meant to be taken as fact.
18227,I’m not in the scientific or medical field.
18228,&gt; Are death rates going down already or not yet?
18229,I think death rates are a trailing indicator.
18230,"I'm guessing you should see infection rates decrease first, then hospitalizations decrease, then death rates decrease."
18231,"I too and looking forward to seeing a noticable improvement in the metrics, it will feel good to see some progress, anything really."
18232,She’s quoting researchers from Duke Human Vaccine Institute.
18233,"Yes, the antibody hang around for a while, we have studied the first batch of volunteers who received the vaccines early last year and their antibody levels are still good months in, and when the levels eventually drop, they would still have T and B cells that can respond to new infections, B cells can manufacture more antibodies as needed."
18234,They are expected to be effective against current and future mutations.
18235,"Remember, the spike is the key the virus use to unlock our cells, if they changed to the point where antibodies don't work well anymore, they would also lose ability to infect our cells."
18236,It reads like it's a bullet.

18256,I actually think that hospitalizations and fatalities will drop first because it is the elderly that is being vaccinated.
18257,Most cases are among the young but most illnesses are among the elderly.
18258,It is a high concentration like 80-90% of hospitalizations and fatalities are in 65+ with health conditions which is something like 12-15% of the population.
18259,"There is a time lag but I think once the at-risk population is vaccinated, serious illnesses will drop very significantly."
18260,Meanwhile cases will continue to spread in the young and healthy population until they are vaccinated.

18265,The rabies vaccine is ~100% effective when started immediately post-exposure.

18280,"Given the number of variants that are being found, it's likely that they have been around since the beginning but have just never been checked."
18281,You have to specifically sequence a virus that is found in order to figure out its variant which they just weren't doing for a while.
18282,This is why the herd immunity strategy was always the worst strategy.

18319,"Not they they are opposed, but they are not going to go way out of their way to get it."
18320,Basically by the time April comes around we need to make this process extremely easy and have many access points so anyone who is interested doesn't have to go out of their way to get it.
18321,We can still achieve a high uptake but it will require more work on pushing the vaccine out instead of relying on people to come to you.

18415,"Here's the text:

Early in the pandemic, many health experts — in the U.S. and around the world — decided that the public could not be trusted to hear the truth about masks."
18416,"Instead, the experts spread a misleading message, discouraging the use of masks."
18417,Their motivation was mostly good.
18418,"It sprung from a concern that people would rush to buy high-grade medical masks, leaving too few for doctors and nurses."
18419,The experts were also unsure how much ordinary masks would help.
18420,But the message was still a mistake.
18421,It confused people.
18422,"(If masks weren’t effective, why did doctors and nurses need them?)"
18423,It delayed the widespread use of masks (even though there was good reason to believe they could help).

“We’re underselling the vaccine,” Dr. Aaron Richterman, an infectious-disease specialist at the University of Pennsylvania, said."
18437,"“It’s going to save your life — that’s where the emphasis has to be right now,” Dr. Peter Hotez of the Baylor College of Medicine said."

18439,"“It’s ridiculously encouraging.”

The details
Here’s my best attempt at summarizing what we know:

The Moderna and Pfizer vaccines — the only two approved in the U.S. — are among the best vaccines ever created, with effectiveness rates of about 95 percent after two doses."
18440,That’s on par with the vaccines for chickenpox and measles.
18441,And a vaccine doesn’t even need to be so effective to reduce cases sharply and crush a pandemic.
18442,"If anything, the 95 percent number understates the effectiveness, because it counts anyone who came down with a mild case of Covid-19 as a failure."
18443,But turning Covid into a typical flu — as the vaccines evidently did for most of the remaining 5 percent — is actually a success.
18444,"Of the 32,000 people who received the Moderna or Pfizer vaccine in a research trial, do you want to guess how many contracted a severe Covid case?"
18445,One.
18446,"Although no rigorous study has yet analyzed whether vaccinated people can spread the virus, it would be surprising if they did."
18447,“If there is an example of a vaccine in widespread clinical use that has this selective effect — prevents disease but not infection — I can’t think of one!” Dr. Paul Sax of Harvard has written in The New England Journal of Medicine.
18448,"(And, no, exclamation points are not common in medical journals.)"
18449,"On Twitter, Dr. Monica Gandhi of the University of California, San Francisco, argued: “Please be assured that YOU ARE SAFE after vaccine from what matters — disease and spreading.”

The risks for vaccinated people are still not zero, because almost nothing in the real world is zero risk."
18450,A tiny percentage of people may have allergic reactions.
18451,And I’ll be eager to see what the studies on post-vaccination spread eventually show.
18452,But the evidence so far suggests that the vaccines are akin to a cure.
18453,"Offit told me we should be greeting them with the same enthusiasm that greeted the polio vaccine: “It should be this rallying cry.”

The costs of negativity
Why are many experts conveying a more negative message?"
18454,"Again, their motivations are mostly good."
18455,"As academic researchers, they are instinctively cautious, prone to emphasizing any uncertainty."

18460,"“Not being completely open because you want to achieve some sort of behavioral public health goal — people will see through that eventually,” Richterman said."
18461,The current approach also feeds anti-vaccine skepticism and conspiracy theories.
18462,"After asking Richterman and others what a better public message might sound like, I was left thinking about something like this:

We should immediately be more aggressive about mask-wearing and social distancing because of the new virus variants."
18463,We should vaccinate people as rapidly as possible — which will require approving other Covid vaccines when the data justifies it.
18464,"People who have received both of their vaccine shots, and have waited until they take effect, will be able to do things that unvaccinated people cannot — like having meals together and hugging their grandchildren."
18465,"But until the pandemic is defeated, all Americans should wear masks in public, help unvaccinated people stay safe and contribute to a shared national project of saving every possible life."

&gt; In Los Angeles County, where on average a person dies every 6 minutes, temporary storage facilities have been set up in the parking lot adjacent to the coroner's office."
18526,"&gt;“This means the vaccine works wonderfully,” Regev-Yochay says."
18527,The results “are in agreement with **Pfizer’s** trials and go even beyond the expected [results].
18528,I expect the tests of the rest of the employees participating to be similar.”
18529,"Just wondering how many on your side spoke out against the Capitol insurrection (where, incidentally, almost no one wore masks)."

18535,The moderna and pfizer vaccines use the same sequence of RNA to make the same protein so if one works it's a safe bet the other does too.
18536,Take a look at bovine coronavirus vaccines.
18537,Those contain dozens of vaccines and need to be given every few months.
18538,That’s where we are headed.

18540,&gt; They are not paying the administration fee.
18541,As in not paying the person who has to give the vaccine to you?
18542,Or are we talking administration as in paper work?
18543,"(Sorry, English is not my first language)"
18544,"yes, and those vaccinated persons that contract COVID19 can still spread the virus to other people, which is why wearing a mask and social distancing by vaccinated persons is still required until the entire population is vaccinated."

18546,Fuckin genius over here
18547,Exactly the opposite here.
18548,"We got a good dump of snow on New Year's, and we have few restrictions, but one is that public indoor exercise is closed, and the snow really saved everyone's sanity..

18555,"I feel more so, that the comment about being healthier, is just something that happens in general."
18556,"People who are more skeptic about things like COVID, or how bad some illnesses are in general, are people who were fortunate enough to be healthy their entire lives."
18557,Kinda like how people who are skeptical about food allergies/issues are people who are lucky enough to literally have no food problems.
18558,Or extremely minor at best.
18559,"they just literally cannot wrap their head around it, as they have no personal experience with it."
18560,Well it also depends on which state you're in.
18561,"Democrats and  Republicans within a state are generally more united about workers rights, whether it's for better or for worse."
18562,There's at least 11 States that require paid sick leave and even some smaller localities have laws about it.
18563,"It's also heavily dependent on industry, size of the organization, and the employer."
18564,"There's also Senators and Representatives at a national level who work tirelessly to get cooperation on these things going, but it's a very slow process and tends to get interrupted by, ""more pressing matters."""
18565,"Overall, unless there's a large voter base in local elections that makes their specific desires known, there isn't much fighting for workers."
18566,How
18567,It all depends on the data.
18568,Rolling out ineffective vaccines isn't helping anyone.
18569,Just watch it's just a super placebo effect.
18570,And if it's not bullshit ?
18571,"Just to clarify; if either of them have conditions that limit their immune systems, they should talk to their doctors about if the vaccine will be expected to be less effective for them."
18572,"For example, if on immunosuppressants for an organ transplant, you may still be vulnerable and may need to keep up precautions until case numbers go down in that area."
18573,&gt; what is the purpose for the restrictions?
18574,Optics and pandering mostly.
18575,It’s the reason for almost everything politicians do
18576,"&gt;Science wins, folks."
18577,It doesn't have time for you or your ideas.
18578,you were criticizing them and didn´t adressed anything you are saying right now.
18579,"&gt;I am stating that by ignoring science

You act like they ignore science but the Catholic church has followed Covid restrictions during masses, they are following science just like everybody else."

18584,"It sucks but shes management and thats what happens sometimes, thats the literal job and pay she was hired for."
18585,Some times my.managers are shortstaffed and theyre salaried but they have to fill in associates work sometimes.
18586,It's part of the job
18587,"I'm sorry, are you trying to say that left leaning areas would just ignore science to stick it to that president?"
18588,"Because every random person I spoke to in Washington, since I never stopped working, was screaming for him to issue a stay at home order."
18589,"I certainly don't work in a very conservative, or even centrist/politically diverse, area."
18590,"&gt;But the governor got booted as a consequence of his lie, did he not?"
18591,"How is that consistent with ""they must lie to be on good terms with Xi""?"

18593,The CCP systematically cracks down against any transparency.
18594,"They encourage to lie to not create ""disturbs""."
18595,"It is not a difference to Trump's logic, the difference is that outside China (and Turkey, Venezuela, etc) there exist a rule of law, it doesn't depend on only one person."
18596,Wow downvoting me into oblivion will certainly make the virus go away.
18597,Do you really think I want it to be like this?
18598,I assure you I don't.
18599,"But the reality is that even with vaccines, the virus will mutate and we will need new vaccines."
18600,"In the process, many people will become infected again."
18601,It's often compared to the flu.
18602,"But, imagine a world where instead of being in bed for a week or two and recovering, you have a large portion of the population who have debilitating side effects for months or longer."
18603,SARS and MERS had debilitating side effects for years and many never fully recovered (Google it) - there's no reason to believe that COVID-19 won't similar lasting side effects for some people.
18604,"And we add to that number year after year, even with a vaccine?"
18605,We simply can't afford to treat this like the flu when the consequences of contracting COVID-19 are so high.

18608,The article basically says it's more lethal.
18609,Overt symptoms are harder to detect until it becomes more serious.
18610,WHO need to look at this before it spreads.
18611,Not wait until after it's worldwide before telling people to prevent it's transmission.
18612,It's also just about bad luck.
18613,Nobody knew which vaccines would work and which wouldn't.
18614,There's way too many Monday morning quarterbacks among politicians across the world right now.
18615,Wow so they are giving time off for all 200 American Aldi employees to get vaccinated?
18616,"Guess they will be temporarily closing stores, because sometimes when I go to Aldi I have to stock shelves myself and be my own cashier because there are no employees around."
18617,Incognito Mode will generally get you around news paywalls
18618,That’s because Texas has HEB.
18619,You wouldn’t see piggly wiggly there.
18620,"Alabama, Louisiana, Mississippi, Georgia, the Carolinas etc"
18621,The headline of that article is actually misleading.
18622,They do not currently have data to support that vaccination with this vaccine prevents transmission.
18623,That would require stimulating a different set of antibodies in the airways/nasal passages of those who received the vaccine.
18624,They did not look at this in this study.
18625,I don't know that they do it in all states but they do it in my state which is a *right to work* and *at will* state.

18652,I guess to this sub that’s wrong.
18653,"If I don’t take the vaccine immediately, I’m a bad person and should get fired from my job."

18656,"If you, like me, were wondering why he got the vaccine:

&gt;Welby, 65, received the vaccine as part of the priority group of frontline healthcare workers, because he volunteers at St Thomas’ Hospital, across the road from his London residence at Lambeth Palace, as part of the hospital’s chaplaincy team."
18657,"&gt;He said that healthcare workers in Britain’s National Health Service and across the world were under immense pressure on the front lines of the pandemic, and getting the vaccine was something people could do to help relieve the burden on them."

18668,For what?
18669,Vaccine is free.
18670,"Lol, read up on some history."
18671,"It was the western council of Europe that agreed upon giving Belgium control of Congo during the scramble for Africa and they were very aware of the atrocities committed there, so much that many other countries like Britain, France and Germany replicated their methods in their own african colonies."
18672,Let's also not act like if slave labor in natural rubber collection was the only atrocity made by the west in Africa.
18673,"There was this little thing called the Atlantic slave trade that enslaved killed another million (in an age where a million was a much bigger share of the population of Africa) just from the trading of slaves, not counting the death and human suffering that resulted from 4 centuries of chattel slavery in the Americas."
18674,&gt;Once the vaccine is widely available you have the total right to say fuck everyone else I'm gonna go live life.

18685,The first cases of SARS-CoV-2 were seeded to Italy in late-Nov and Dec.  By January it was too late for anyone to do anything.
18686,"They thought it would look like SARS-1 or MERS and be vastly more severe, and not have as many asymptomatic infections and they reacted similarly because that had worked in the past."

18699,But at least you agree that she was facing four years in jail for saying issues that were different that then chinese State official line.
18700,"I mean, we know what happened with Hong Kong protesters."
18701,And I don't believe that one third of US population (for example) should go four years to jail because they are anti-masks.
18702,"Also, I have an antivaxxer friend and I would not want him to be four years in jail, even if he poses a harmful view to himself and others."

18710,Your comment comes across as implying more.
18711,Why are all the other states better at planning birthday parties?
18712,Why is the wealthiest state with the highest taxes in the nation and the most progressive politicians faltering so horribly?
18713,https://covidtracking.com/data - Looks like US hospitalisations peaked on 2021-01-06 at 132474.
18714,Down to 123848 as of 2021-01-18.
18715,Is this a real decline or is it due to the many deaths (7-day average over 3K since the 7th) that were recorded over that time period?
18716,I'm so glad the WHO just says blanket statements like this to try to build up some credibility.
18717,The WHO and the CCP are wholly responsible for Nov.2019-Mar.2020 ineptitude and conspiracy.
18718,"The US taxpayer financed the Moderna vaccine, and then they get charged for it when administered."
18719,"As far as I'm concerned for Moderna, US citizens have already paid for it twice over by the time they get it, and you can bet a large portion of their health insurances will compensate rates and coverages FY2022 to recoup even more costs because of this rollout."
18720,"Couple that it is more likely you will get COVID-19 in the US than every poor country except Andora and more likely you'll die from COVID-19 in the US than every poor country except North Macedonia (Cases/1M population, Deaths/1M population)."
18721,I have COVID right now and I was gifted almost two weeks of sick leave.
18722,I think there is already a government plan in place for it.
18723,"The FFCRA, I believe."
18724,"To further clarify, my employer only has PTO, not sick leave."
18725,This sick leave they're giving me is COVID-specific and was enacted once I showed them my positive test result.
18726,A friend of mine is a pediatric “hospitalist”.
18727,She has very few Covid cases in her hospital.
18728,The last one she mentioned was an older teen and he was in for other stuff.
18729,I’m not buying the 100s of admissions either.
18730,No.
18731,You're jumping to the conclusion you want using literally no science.
18732,Do you even do science?
18733,You constantly extrapolate data from other experiments in order to form hypothesis...
18734,No
18735,"I think we’re at 400,000 but I’m not sure what the trajectory is."
18736,Did the virus already reach the more vulnerable folks?
18737,Probably not all of them.
18738,Will the new variants be more contagious but less deadly?
18739,Let’s hope less deadly.
18740,Will having more active cases increase deaths of other causes?
18741,Quite possibly as people defer treatment.
18742,Smart
18743,and they must have been high to start with.
18744,can you try to explain it then?
18745,I don't think you are making it clear.
18746,You stated the rate of infection is going up even though 30% is vaccinated.
18747,I gave reasons why this could happen... you gave.. uhh nothing as term as a reply
18748,When one is shown to be dead wrong just keep arguing some more.
18749,I think you’re the one who’s missed what actually happened during the process of leaving.
18750,And brain dead remainers will fight tooth and nail to never be proved wrong that possibly there might actually be some benefits to brexit.
18751,Not yet.
18752,There haven’t been enough people vaccinated yet.
18753,But there are plans in place to vaccinate 100 million people in the next 3 months or so.
18754,It will get better.

18773,"Nope, sadly I think some just don't care that businesses are being screwed over by these lockdowns."
18774,"And as for the city of Chicago(where for now indoor dining still isn't allowed, never mind a few restaurants and bars quietly ignore the rules and allow indoor dining/drinking), outdoor tents are allowed as long as one side of the tent is open to outdoor air."
18775,"Ditto with inside restaurants, as long as such tables and seats are within 8 feet of an open window."
18776,"I'm curious, where do you live where outdoor tent seating areas aren't allowed for restaurants?"
18777,"Surprised they aren't allowed, unless say you live in LA where I read a rumor that such restrictions were briefly done."
18778,"I'm not sure what LA (and also LA County) are currently doing, since I don't closely follow that."
18779,that is valid.

18824,Guess how I know you’re an American.
18825,AstraZenneca and J&amp;J approval will help immensely.
18826,My child has been at school today and I have been at work today (in education)...utter nonsense!
18827,He replied to a comment about obesity and smoking deaths... they kill hundreds of thousands every year but people don’t give a fuck
18828,"Salaried employees generally get some kind of paid sick leave in the US, but hourly wage workers - which includes most of the people in retail, restaurants, etc."
18829,- do not (at least not by law).
18830,They just don't pay you when you are out sick.
18831,"Which is why people work when they are sick, further spreading disease."
18832,"From the article:

The security guards were hired by former Pueblo County Sheriff Dan Corsentino who runs a security firm and provides services for the Diocese of Pueblo."
18833,He said his firm got a call the week before from leaders of the diocese because too many people at the Westcliffe church were not wearing masks.
18834,Something church leaders had warned the congregation about.
18835,"""Subsequently that was not followed,"" Corsentino said."
18836,"""There was non-compliance by many parishioners from what we were told."""
18837,"Corsentino said there was no altercation, but his workers did ask people to leave."
18838,"Even though they have been told this was done for their safety and for those who are concerned about the spread of COVID-19, some parishioners believe it was done with other motives."
18839,"""They are doing this because they are trying to follow the orders of the Governor,"" Hernandez said."
18840,"""It's a question of control."""
18841,"""They are not doing it for my protection,"" said Terry Napolitan, another member of the church."
18842,"""I'm an adult I can make the decisions on what's best for me and my family."""
18843,Regarding the downvotes like you said your comment is 100% off topic.
18844,Lol
18845,Source?
18846,"""Needlessly pessimistic"" is the thing I am WAY over."
18847,I'll wear a mask for two more years if it means I don't have to hear anymore relentless pessimism that has no bearing on the actual reality and could actually make the situation worse.
18848,"""Perfect is the enemy of good."""
18849,"- The mantra that much of the scientific community (aerosol scientists who STILL are not being properly listened to notwithstanding), and the U.S. msm (tv especially) has been living by since the April 2020."
18850,"Not working in any test and trace teams, but the ifo on testing is freely available in Ireland through the HSE government website."
18851,It was found that the predominant transmission location is at home among family members.
18852,"In recent weeks one funeral caused hundreds of cases in the South east (Wicklow) because although the priest enforced 10 people in the church for the ceremony, along the way to the funeral there was 250 people all breaking social distancing and hugging."
18853,"Workplaces are also still spreading it, but at much lower levels since our strictest lockdown was introduced after Christmas."
18854,"Christmas really fucked us over tbh, people just couldn't listen to health advice."
18855,that's why i said either and not both.
18856,"like, you don't even understand what words mean, stop trying to make shitty points about things you don't understand."
18857,I don't know.
18858,"I mean, if I was running the show I'd give the people the day off if they came in with a fever, muscle soreness, etc."
18859,But I'm also not upper management in a brutally competitive industry.
18860,There is a vaccine that is currently being tested on children 12 and over (though the article didn’t have info on an approval timeline).
18861,"So, it may be sooner then you think, it least for middle schoolers."
18862,I don't think you know how to interpret statistics in clinical trials.
18863,Stupid title.
18864,Those who chose to grandstand and do nothing are failing 1 year on.
18865,Losers always point fingers
18866,I don't know why he didn't just call the cops.
18867,They can refuse service to anybody.
18868,"That ""Karen"" needs to grow up and get a life."
18869,But it’s a crazy conspiracy theory... right?
18870,"Also, that second text is correct."
18871,"If you don’t get vaccinated or have the vaccine passport, you will lose access to being a normal member of society."
18872,"No restaurants, no movies, no leaving the US, no plane travel."
18873,My payment was $175 per vaccine administration visit and will be $50 for the subsequent visits over the next two years for follow-ups.
18874,"So yeah, not enough to pay rent or anything but good to have for some extra fun money."
18875,Here it is 4 weeks from year 1 onwards if you're permanent staff.
18876,Casual staff get higher pay rate that builds in leave.
18877,Taking a proper break really is important to work well.
18878,"I figure it is 1 week to wind down from work stress, 2 weeks relaxation with your mind off work, 1 week starting to think about going back to work."
18879,"Thanks for this awesome, informed  reply."
18880,"There’s concern about the new variants being able to partially escape vaccine induced immunity, from what I’ve seen it’s mostly experts extrapolating from a few studies showing some people’s immune systems didn’t recognize the new variants."
18881,Cool.
18882,Do they pay if you have Jury Duty?
18883,What about parental leave?
18884,"What if you're in the hospital, do they have disability insurance?"
18885,"For real, if this was all it took to end this fiasco, my answer would be DONE."
18886,"Sign a notarized form agreeing not to seek ANY medical treatment for Covid, in exchange for being “allowed” to live life with no restrictions."
18887,"Done, done, DONE."
18888,If only I had been offered such a choice....
18889,even so.
18890,in your comment above you say even after being vaccinated you will be eating at home.
18891,there is no greater level of personal protection than the vaccine offers.
18892,"If you are still fearful even after being vaccinated, you may want to talk to a professional about health anxiety; because, what you outlined above is a reality in which you never leave your home."
18893,"I wonder how many of them just assume they are already immune since they already had covid, because FEMA had been raiding and stealing their PPE at the beginning of the pandemic."
18894,"The Oxford trial did test, though."
18895,Dude...don't listen to people on this sub.
18896,You can look at any thread and see 10 kinds of misinformation going on.
18897,Nobody here knows dick about what you should do with your life.
18898,"Honestly, I keep spamming this on every convo here, but it's necessary."
18899,Check out Dr. Michael Osterholm's weekly COVID19 Update podcast.
18900,He is more qualified than any user here to comment on anything COVID related.
18901,"He has up to date information, and has weighed in on questions people have like ""Can I gather with my family if we are all vaccinated?"""
18902,"And his answer- ""As soon as I get my second dosage, and my family has it, and the post-vaccine waiting period closes, you can bet I'm going to have an amazing family party."""
18903,The vaccine is our only shot at being able to go back to normal.
18904,Don't let these fools convince you otherwise.
18905,[removed]
18906,"If my employer paid, I would get the vaccine shot twice"
18907,Absolutely; and probably the next bout of norovirus or whatever would take them out as well.
18908,"Nonetheless, they may get a few more days or months from not being vaccinated and shielding hard if they really are that frail."
18909,"However, this will only apply to a very small number of people at the very end of their lives and won't make a statistical difference to the progression of the disease in the community as a whole."
18910,"We are past half a million, the data just hasn't caught up honestly."
18911,I wonder what makes that one guy (or whoever that 2% is) so special?
18912,I like how I said this later in the thread and yet got down voted a bunch...
18913,[deleted]
18914,"There was a metastudy where secondary attack rate in a household for asymptomatic people was 0.7%, but was 18% for symptomatic people."
18915,I'd say that's a pretty good indicator of how infrequently asymptomatic spread actually occurs.
18916,Why do companies only seem to be offering these incentives in the US ?
18917,If people are being offered the jab free like countries with universal healthcare then why the extra incentive ?
18918,Not seen any extra incentive for Aldi workers elsewhere in the world..
18919,"Well, his model is already fucked because healthcare workers on the COVID units I cover at my hospital who normally nelglect the flu shot have been getting their COVID vaccine."
18920,Source: nurse managers of those units.
18921,I think it's ridiculous that non-mask wearing FOOLS video record the staff at stores not letting them in when there are state mandates WE WANT TO SEE *YOU* KAREN not the store employee doing his thankless job of preventing morons like you from entering the store.
18922,"Hey Karen: TURN THE CAMERA SHOW *YOUR* face, you coward!"
18923,"Sure, I was talking about the topic at hand, but if you want to go off on tangents..."

18926,Namibia is not the poorest nation out there.
18927,And it should receive it's first Pfizer doses before the end of the month through COVAX.
18928,"This is about natural immunity, not vaccines."
18929,Thank you
18930,"COVID is not on track to kill 780,000 people in a year."
18931,The point of the vaccine is to literally prevent severe illness in you and your mom.
18932,"After the vaccine, even if you contract covid, you should barely notice."
18933,Go live life with robust antibodies.
18934,How's it got anything to do with Brexit?
18935,Everything the UK has done could have been legally achieved in the EU AFAIK.
18936,"You wish, in moments like these it shows you the reality of wealthy countries just like what the rich does to the poor"
18937,"Ah so the headline should have read, ""Large Corporation Gives Workers A Few Hours to Ensure Basic Healthcare Need Met"""
18938,The way I view it is that the pandemic ends when we give the vaccine to as many people as possible.
18939,"It isn't worth the hospital's time to correct it if someone comes in early, it is better to use all available time to deliver as many shots as necessary."
18940,"Congratulations on the vaccine, you just helped everyone get out of the pandemic a bit sooner."
18941,"Belgium might owe the Congo, but ""The West"" doesn't."
18942,It was Western activists who helped put an end to the Congo Free State.
18943,"In German, it is Aldi South and Aldi North."
18944,It used to be like a Walgreens way back in the day owned by the mother and two brothers disputed and separated the company.
18945,One going in a little bit different direction than the other brother.
18946,I believe one wanted to sell Smokes.
18947,Also Aldi Nord took over Trader Joe's and the brother Karl Albrecht ran Aldi Nord.
18948,Also a fun fact is that Karl also fought for the German army during WWII so technically he was a Nazi and anyone who shops at Trader Joe's supports Nazis.
18949,I think that's how it goes.
18950,"A couple days ago I made a comment asking about a sudden onset of a hot, red, itchy, hard bump at my injection site about 10 days after I had the moderna vaccine."
18951,I never found any good info on it and I don’t have insurance so I couldn’t see a doctor.
18952,My red spot has spread so I did a deeper dive into it all and I finally found that 0.8% of people had a “delayed injection site reaction” like I described and it’s not an infection or dangerous or anything.
18953,It should resolve soon on its own.
18954,I’m relieved because I didn’t want anything to prevent me from getting the second dose.
18955,I just thought I’d leave this comment in case anyone else experienced it and didn’t know what was going on.
18956,"Wealthy countries have already committed to doing just that, ***after*** their own people get taken care of first."
18957,Just stay on the daily discussion thread lol
18958,I never said the goal needed to be 100%.
18959,Thoseb refusing due to being misinformed is but going to help the situation though.
18960,[removed]
18961,Yeah and since kids can’t get a vaccine there will be high infection rates among and a lot of unnecessary hospitalizations and even deaths.
18962,"Same, I just got a appointment at a state site in late March."
18963,I would have gotten my first shot tomorrow if it wasn’t cancelled.
18964,🥲
18965,Have they not said that the vaccines will still be effective in a reduced capacity against the mutations?
18966,So we may not even need a second vaccine if it doesn't cause as many deaths in the elderly as the dominant covid mutation causes.
18967,"https://www.livemint.com/news/india/covid19-vaccine-covaxin-is-safe-have-confidence-in-scientists-regulators-says-aiims-director-11610791271232.html

Fine, then what about this?"
18968,This has literally been said by the director of the best hospital in india
18969,"Sounds like it definitely depends on which trial you're part of, through the Pfizer trial we get paid $150 every office visit, to pay for any missed work or gas/travel expenses (I live fairly close to one of the research facilities, so i was actually able to pocket most of that, rather than need it to supplement lost wages)

I fill out a weekly journal that pays me $5 to a debit card each time I fill it out."
18970,"So certainly not enough to count for anything more than maybe an extra shift or two if you're an avery hourly worker, but enough that I didn't make me balk at potentially missing any work to participate."

18992,And they keep screwing up by insisting schools are safe when there is no way in hell that they are with the level of uncontrolled infection in the country.
18993,Ah but to the q crowd it’s ‘super obvius’

19013,This study sucks.
19014,If I understand it correctly.
19015,"They tested 10,427 people for covid antibodies."
19016,"Of those 10,000 they found 1,058 had antibodies."
19017,Then at a later date they checked antibody levels on just 346 people.
19018,And again later on only 35 people.
19019,"Of those 35 people, the ones with higher antibody levels were either a smoker, type O blood or vegetarian."
19020,I’m gonna need more than 35 people to trust a study.
19021,"But in some way, you are making the point for that person."
19022,"If young people are uncertain about a vaccine that had to be rushed out because of the extent of the pandemic and then are repeatedly told ""but you can still get sick and spread it"", then the ones who want to save Iives might also be thinking about their own."
19023,"Now, I don't particularly agree with that, but the logic itself is sound."
19024,It could also be argued that a person doesn't want to get vaccinated and then feel like they might slip up or get too comfortable not even KNOWING if they're infected.
19025,"A young person might say, ""hey, not only will I still get it, I won't even know I have it and will probably be less likely to get tested and may inadvertantly pass it on."""
19026,The messaging is inarguably terrible so far.
19027,OMG the comments are so crazy!!
19028,What is the average  american to do?
19029,You asshat commenters make a bad problem worse..x10
19030,Young people can’t get major infections didn’t you know?

19032,TDR didn't do him any favors either
19033,"Once the vaccine becomes readily available to everyone, I could care less who gets it and who doesn't."
19034,"I feel the criticism, heavily i really do, but judt because they say it doesn't mean itll pass."
19035,"The question to ask is , I have 1 million doses, I have a country that has vaccinated 50% of it's population, do I sell it to them to vaccinate their young adults, or, do I sell it to another country that hasn't vaccinated anyone yet, and who is willing to pay ."
19036,"I get why the comments are so one-sided, everyone wants a jab to end this thing, and everyone will get it eventually, but for example, Africa only has 74 million people 65 of older, and getting them vaccinated would go a long way without disturbing the vaccination too much."
19037,"I wear a mask when I go out, avoid going out of I don't need to, maintain distance wherever possible....

You know, ask the things that have been recommended for a year now that you're too important to bother with."
19038,&gt;I've many times wanted to wear a mask and couldn't because it was socially unacceptable.
19039,"Remember that even though your comment is upvoted, you are the outlier."
19040,People in this sub tend to be far more paranoid and sensationalist than normal people.
19041,"Masks will not become commonplace in western society, period."
19042,"The second the mandates go away, mine is going in the garbage."
19043,Ok then we well glaze over the extra limb people are growing out of the foreheads after the vaccine 😁
19044,VS ending it nowhere.
19045,"This isn’t uncommon, you had it way back last year and antibodies from it generally last 4-6 months."
19046,I have a friend who lost antibodies after 6 months and got it again
19047,Northeast got hit early when we didn't know how to treat it as well.
19048,This headline

19052,I have read that some people had to take a day or two off after being vaccinated.
19053,"It's not that common, but sometimes the side effects exhaust the person a bit and is unable to work well."
19054,So would vaccinating workers also get 2 days off?
19055,Yes sadly I've been seeing too many people using Norway as an example that the vaccine is dangerous.
19056,Such a shame

19087,I am being realistic.
19088,"Until everyone in the population has the opportunity to be vaccinated, including kids, masks and social distancing are going to need to continue."
19089,What is unrealistic is to expect or believe that everyone is going to return to normal within a few months; or that a person's social responsibility ends 10 days after a second vaccination dose.
19090,That isn't going to happen.
19091,Masks and social distancing are going to continue to at least the end of the year.

19107,"The article is focused more on a temporary issue, that the vaccine is 50% effective 2 weeks after the first shot and 95% effective 2 weeks after the 2nd."
19108,"Ie, you're putting yourself at high risk if you suddenly go maskless and hang out in crowded spots with other maskless people immediate after the first shot."
19109,"The real reason we should expect it will take many months before we no longer have mask requirements, restricted capacity, expected to keep a distance, etc."
19110,"is because it's too easy for anti-mitigation people to lie and claim they had the vaccine, putting themselves and others at risk."

19184,Once deaths drop we are done and that’s really that I think /shrug
19185,This is not the flu or the flu vaccine.
19186,There have been several studies that found that asymptomatics are not driving spread- presymptomatics can.
19187,The WHO has even said it.
19188,I’m not sure why you’re using the stats in that article in the way that you are.
19189,"Yes, 15 is about 40% of 39, but you really seem to be picking some stats out of the article without looking at the whole context of what was said."
19190,"&gt; Among those who were negative at baseline and without symptoms, 39 (0.3%) in the placebo group and 15 (0.1%) in the mRNA-1273 group had nasopharyngeal swabs that were positive for SARS-CoV-2 by PCR at week 4."
19191,"These data suggest that even after one dose, the vaccine has a protective effect in preventing asymptomatic infection."
19192,Why did you turn this .1% into negative news?
19193,"This was of vaccinated people- out of 10s of 1,000s in the study, .1% were found to have Positive PCR- which is a whole different question of whether PCR tests are even meant to diagnose."
19194,Could they then spread the infection?

19198,You do you though.
19199,Because the entirety of the population either willingly won’t or in some cases can’t take the vaccine.
19200,We don’t even have one approved for kids yet.
19201,It’s about being realistic.
19202,"They have vaccinated 25% of their population, most of whom have only gotten 1 shot."
19203,Obviously that's not going to have an incredibly visible effect on cases.
19204,What it should hopefully be impacting in the coming weeks is deaths because the most vulnerable people are getting vaccinated first.

19206,There are no patients or people more vulnerable than those in her charge.

19340,I take exception to the suggestion that poor countries don't have access to vaccines simply because of corporate greed and the specter of colonialism.
19341,I recognize that there's some factors at play here that keep poor countries poor.
19342,That doesn't change the fact that I find the WHO's paid scold chastising wealthy countries about vaccinating middle-aged doctors while elderly villagers in remotest Bangladesh haven't gotten their sub-zero mRNA vaccines yet to be disingenuous and completely unsurprising.
19343,Negative 21 downvotes.
19344,Serves you right.
19345,This is why getting both shots is so important.
19346,"If you want solid, long lasting immunity, you need that booster shot."
19347,Wasn’t 18 months always the optimistic timeline?
19348,That’s this September.
19349,Seems like we could be on track for best case scenario
19350,It isn't a (safe) thing without vaccination.
19351,Herd immunity with vaccination is the actual goal
19352,There have not been any CDC first dose vaccine data since Friday.
19353,Any clue what the numbers could be?

19457,"The stigma kinda stuck around because their prices are so cheap and the ""no frills"" stuff is how all their stores are."

19919,The risk of the virus is heavily focused on people in nursing homes and the elderly with pre-existing conditions.
19920,"I have never set foot in a nursing home and have not been within 100 feet of anyone 65+ for months, maybe once or twice at the grocery store."
19921,As a healthy person under 55 I am personally at very little risk but I am supposed to lock down and restrict my behavior on behalf of these people that might get sick.
19922,I get it and society has to pull together etc.
19923,but the only way I can contribute to the problem is if I inadvertently become a link the transmission chain from someone that has it to someone that is at risk.
19924,"Yes, this can happen, but is extremely unlikely."
19925,Meanwhile the people that are at risk should be 1000 times more careful than me including people that take care of them in nursing homes and such.
19926,If 90% of the risk is concentrated in 15% of the people then those people should be the most protected.
19927,Instead the same guidelines are given to everyone equally.
19928,Aldi is great.
19929,They give their cashiers chairs to sit down in.

Not sure where the fuck you live, but EVERYONE near me (DFW, a fucking huge dense place) is back to work, back to school, going to stores, going on vacation, and acting like everything is okay."

19942,Are you fucking dumb?

20024,&gt; I mean cases went down last summer with no vaccine just because everyone was outside and the spread was lessened.
20025,Texas would disagree with this entire statement.
20026,We spiked in the summer.
20027,"And are currently spiking in the ""it's really nice outside"" season when everyone is outside."
20028,Though the current spike is most likely primarily from holiday gatherings.
20029,&gt; By that I mean normal life +masks and -concerts and music festivals.
20030,So basically exactly like the last 7 months.
20031,It's not rational though because if you look at all the factors you're going to realize that you aren't going to be able to merrily go about your normal life if society is getting hit hard by this and has to shut things down.
20032,You can wish all you want but they're not going to make laws with special exceptions for you because you think you're invincible.
20033,If you're acting based on pure self-interest the most relevant strategy would be to demand full Wuhan-level lockdown for a short time so that the virus will go away and stop bothering your life.
20034,"What we're really dealing with here is short-term self-interest winning out over the long-term, which is actually irrational but tempting because you get quicker gratification."
20035,"Unfortunately we see the same attitude all over policy-making in general, which results in almost always kicking the can down the road instead of working to deal with any serious problems."
20036,They were actually the first ever supermarket as we know it!

20044,Doesn't really seem to be going that way though.
20045,"Sadly, there's a large chunk of this country who value celebrities and athletes more than whoever is in the White House."

&gt;Facility for quarantine objectors in Saxony  
&gt;  
&gt;January 15, 2021, 4:47 p.m.Source: dpa  
&gt;  
&gt;Dresden (dpa) - [Saxony](https://www.zeit.de/thema/sachsen) wants to put a facility for quarantine refusers into operation in the coming week."
20199,The Interior Ministry announced on Friday.
20200,"So far, however, no objectors are known who should be segregated by court order, it said."
20201,The Free State had refrained from placing those affected in a hospital because all capacities there were urgently needed in the corona pandemic.
20202,The “Bild” newspaper reported on Friday about plans to set up a “jail for those who refused to quarantine” on the premises of the central reception facility for refugees.
20203,"&gt;  
&gt;Health Minister Petra Köpping (SPD) had already made it clear in spring 2020 that such a coercive measure was only a last resort and required a judicial decision."
20204,"The [Ministry of the Interior](https://www.zeit.de/thema/innenministerium) now announced: “In practice, the responsible health department first determines the quarantine."
20205,"This is followed by the urgent admonition and, in the event of further opposition, the initiation of administrative fine proceedings. """
20206,Only then do legal proceedings follow.
20207,"&gt;  
&gt;According to the Interior Ministry, Section 30 of the Infection Protection Act provides for the compulsory placement of objectors in a locked hospital or other suitable accommodation."
20208,Compulsory placement takes place in accordance with the Family Procedure Act (Section 415).
20209,The responsible health department is the applicant at the court.
20210,as soon as J&amp;J gets their approved it will be better.
20211,And sure the outgoing mess of an administration nationalized it.

20229,"*Here is the new update from* Sweden **(2021-01-19, Tuesday):**

*Following the holidays, the number updates are on Tuesday-Friday's and press-briefings on Tuesdays and Thursdays."
20230,* ***Reporting of deaths over the holidays will have additional lag so numbers are expected to rise additionally in the coming weeks!
20231,"***

*Last reported numbers at a glance 2021-01-15: Friday - 523486 (+4703) confirmed cases and 10323 (+138) deaths*

* Numbers at a glance (previously in the post title): **533265** (+9779) confirmed cases and **10591** (+268) deaths
* 14-day incidence rate in Sweden is now 616 per 100.000."
20232,"This is considerable decrease compared to the previous weeks, even though there was a dip earlier weeks due to the lower testing over the holidays."
20233,"Last time the incidence rate was this low was on 1st of December 2020, so *overall* quite positive development for the lowering of the infection rates."
20234,"* The incidence rate is dropping throughout all age groups, as in the most infected (20-59) which previously was staying close to 600 per 100.000 weekly incidence rate for over a month, the numbers have now dropped to shortly below 400 per 100.000, a decrease by a third."
20235,"* Skåne still has a much higher incidence rates than the country's average, but they seem to be dropping as well - 1122 per 100.000 for the last 14-days compared to last week's Thursday report when it was 1272."
20236,"The decline in Stockholm is also continuing, now at incidence rate of 369 per 100.000 - far below the country's current average."
20237,"Few other highlighted regions in the briefing are Jämtland-Härjedalen which is showing a decline in the incidence rate that was stable for over a month and is now down to 509 per 100.000 (it is a small region with total 5391 confirmed cases since the start of the pandemic); Dalarna continues with the decline and is now at 459 per 100.000;
* An interesting development is that there are so far no (or very low number) confirmed cases of the seasonal flu for 2020-2021 season."
20238,* The number of ICU patients is also continuing to decrease from their peak which according to the [Swedish ICU Register](https://www.icuregswe.org/en/data--results/covid-19-in-swedish-intensive-care/) was 12 days ago at 7/1 with 387 patients.
20239,"Overall, the numbers of patients in the ICU have been lower in autumn compared to the spring, but many more are treated in other hospital wards and the overall hospital capacity taken by COVID-19 patients in the winter wave (3000 at the peak) exceeded that of the spring one (2200 at the peak)."
20240,"However, it is also showing a definitive decline in numbers for the last two weeks!"
20241,"* 2160 are the patients in hospital care with COVID-19 (excluding ICU), large decrease by 300 patients compared to the previous week."
20242,"348 is today's ICU patients with COVID-19, also decrease compared to the 362 last press-briefing."
20243,"774 is the total ICU capacity of beds with respirator (small decrease since last week), with about 20% free capacity."
20244,"* 10591 are the total reported that died with COVID-19, increase of 268 compared to the last report in Friday."
20245,Two of the uncertain date deaths have been clarified (and this number is now down to 32) and the deaths were assigned to 27/11 and mid-December.
20246,"There are still some deaths added to weeks 51 and 52 but they are less than 10 in the new report so these weeks are likely ""mostly completed"" now."
20247,"Almost 50 deaths were added to the reports in week 53, so this week is still being changed considerably."
20248,It seems as if the lag in reporting is lowering but it is still twice more than what was the time to report 90% prior to the holidays.
20249,"* The deadliest day in the pandemic is now 28/12 with 120 deaths in a single day (and since it is in week 53, it might increase by a bit still)."
20250,17/12 is now second with 118 deaths in a single day.
20251,"The weekly deaths in December are still below the spring peak weekly numbers (when two weeks marked 664 and 658 deaths) but quite close with week 51 at 641, 52 at 626, week 53 is currently at 616 but could increase by a bit still."
20252,"* The number of newly admitted ICU patients has also dropped sharply in the previous several weeks, from the winter peak of 231 in week 53 down to 139 in week 2 (last week)."
20253,The number of newly admitted ICU patients hasn't been this low weekly value since the first half of November 2020.
20254,"* The number of total tested individuals for last week aren't published yet, but last week had -10k less confirmed cases than the week prior when the testing started increasing again after lowering over the holidays."
20255,"Week 53 had only 198k individuals tested, but over 20% positivity rate and 41k new confirmed cases."
20256,Week 1 had 207k individuals tested that resulted in 19% positivity rate and 39k new cases.
20257,Week 2 so had less than 29k confirmed cases in total.
20258,"====

**Please, remember there is lag in reporting and deaths reported on a certain day are usually mostly deaths that happened on previous days."
20259,On average it takes up to 11 days to report 90% of the deaths for a certain day (see in the links graphs about how that looks);** ***with the current holidays this lag has more than doubled.

20281,Yeah we are kinda doomed
20282,We can get back to normal if hospitals have capacity and high risk people (namely 65+) have had the chance to get vaccinated.
20283,If you want to get back to normal as fast as possible the solution is an age based vaccination system.
20284,The expenses are not the problem.
20285,Maintaining quarantine measures any longer is much more expensive than vaccination.
20286,"Anyways, the WHO keeps claiming this but from what I've seen the 5 countries which have developed vaccines are exporting as many or much more than they're using themselves."

20288,"**

*Published 13:52 (The text is being updated, in case of changes I will update the translation too)*

About 147,000 people have now been vaccinated against covid-19 in Sweden, according to the information that the regions have reported to the Public Health Agency."
20289,"Later on Tuesday, figures per region will be published."
20290,"To date, nearly 90 million cases of covid-19 have been detected around the world."
20291,State epidemiologist Anders Tegnell describes the situation as still serious.
20292,"\- After slightly lower figures during the Christmas holidays, the rise now continues on roughly the same line as before."
20293,"So unfortunately we have probably not had a diminishing effect on the pandemic so far, says Tegnell."
20294,"In Sweden, there is a ""cautious decline"", but Tegnell emphasizes that one should be careful about drawing early conclusions."
20295,The spread of infection appears to have decreased most in the younger age groups.
20296,"\- They seem to rise quickly but also fall back at a fast pace, says Tegnell."
20297,"Since Friday, 9,770 new covid cases have been registered in Sweden."
20298,"A total of 533,265 people have been confirmed infected with covid-19 in the country since the start of the pandemic."
20299,"268 deaths have been registered since last Friday and a total of 10,591 people have now died in the suites of covid-19 in the country."
20300,"4,597 people with confirmed covid-19 have so far been cared for in ICU."
20301,"\- ICU is a bit behind the development in the spread of infection in society, says Tegnell."
20302,The state epidemiologist reports the situation in certain regions.
20303,Skåne is the region that is worst affected right now in terms of the spread of infection and Stockholm has had a clearer decline since a few weeks ago.
20304,The feared increase in infection that was worried about in connection with ski trips in the regions Jämtland-Härjedalen and Dalarna seems to have been absent.
20305,\- It does not look like there has been any extensive spread of infection in connection with it (skiing ed.
20306,Note).
20307,"To date, approximately 147,000 people have been vaccinated against covid-19 in Sweden, but Tegnell emphasizes that the reporting from the various regions is not yet complete."
20308,"\- We want to continue to emphasize that it is important that the regions continue to use all the doses they can so that we get rapid protection, says Tegnell."
20309,"Taha Alexandersson, deputy head of emergency preparedness at the National Board of Health and Welfare, says that there is a reduction in the number of patients with covid-19 who need intensive care compared with the previous week."
20310,She emphasizes that healthcare is more affected in the southern parts of the country and that there is great variation between the country's regions regarding the capacity for intensive care.
20311,"\- We need to utilize all capacity, she says."
20312,"Listen, I'm some freaking twenty something who doesn't make or study vaccines for a living."
20313,I'm repeating what the government of my state has said.
20314,I think you know that the science isn't done.
20315,That the thought is lower viral load is lower risk of spread.
20316,That more people vaccinated is better than less.
20317,I was eligible.
20318,I was told to take it.
20319,I did.
20320,"My family will be completely vaccinated soon, so will most of my friends(healthcare workers)."
20321,"Once my worries about bringing Covid home are no longer in play, I will no longer be wearing a N95 in public."
20322,"It's shocking, it's just not surprising."
20323,"&gt;According to updated data from Johns Hopkins University, there were an additional 1,400 coronavirus deaths nationwide on Monday -- a significantly lower figure for the month and the lowest daily toll since Jan. 3."
20324,CNN reported Tuesday that a researcher at the University of Arizona says the coronavirus variant identified in Britain may have actually circulated first in the United States.
20325,Masked residents are seen on Sunday waiting in line outside the Abyssinian Baptist Church in New York City to receive a dose of the coronavirus vaccine.

20333,Sucks to suck.
20334,"Yeah, not sure if it's reporters that are taking comments from scientists out of context or just trying to get clicks but it's really not helpful."
20335,Most of these variants are a single mutation of the spike protein which really shouldn't have any impact on vaccine efficacy.
20336,The only one that I'm aware of that could is the South African one which has several.
20337,Even then it is highly unlikely it would be completely vaccine resistant.
20338,A black hole may consume earth.

20357,I don’t think the data on transmission after vaccination will take that long to find.
20358,"However, Israel, despite being the country with the most vaccination rollouts, is now the country with the most infections per day, showing that the vaccine alone is not enough to control the spread of the disease."
20359,"Another research showed that after the first shot, people have a disappointing level of body antidotes which are lower than Pfiser reported, meaning that there is a one month lag between the time people get the first shot to them being actually vaccinated, which might be too slow when mutations becoming more and more infective."
20360,This place is constantly telling us how badly the west has handled covid and how well places like Africa have handled it.
20361,"By this sub's own logic the west needs the vaccine most, so why's that selfish?"
20362,This is a good thing in that scientists found the new strain since it does have an infection that had already been researched (L452R).
20363,If vaccines need to be updated... then so be it.
20364,"In its current form, I doubt this variant will be a big deal as it lacks the N501Y mutation that both Brazilian, SA, and UK strains all have."
20365,The L452R mutation is thought to behave similarly to the 484K mutation.

20410,The U.S. media (tv especially) has been an epic failure too when it comes to how the virus spreads and where.
20411,They're giving them 4 hours of paid time off if they get vaccinated (more or less).

20413,"It's nuanced, but those two things are different."
20414,It's far less worth it and depends on your local weather.

20418,"We never actually shut down, and even our “please stay home if you want k thanks” order from Ducey had such far reaching “essential” positions basically everyone qualified themselves as essential and nobody questioned it."
20419,Closest we got to an actual shutdown was the curfew after Fashion Square got trashed and that wasn’t even related to covid or enforced outside of downtown.
20420,Hopefully the stadium getting converted to a 24/7 vaccine site and the new one in Gilbert will help move things in a positive direction.
20421,"The department of health booking site is confusing as hell, but people are getting the vaccine"

20486,It’s due to quantity.
20487,Imagine there is a certain percent chance of a single virus mutating that is quite small.
20488,When you have millions of infections globally that increases the chance exponentially of a virus having a mutation that ends up being beneficial (to the virus).
20489,Damn you got me
20490,Funny how they controlled the virus unlike the US.

20505,[I read](https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2021/01/coronavirus-evolving-same-mutations-around-world/617721/) that the virologists there were concerned that strain was more resistant to antibodies that people develop from their first infection.
20506,Not to mention the fact that these are all two dose regimens and there would need to be processes in place to track who needs the second dose when.
20507,J&amp;J is the vaccine that would work best in the developing world.

20569,"&gt;The number of nursing home workers in New York State who have declined the coronavirus vaccine rivals the number who have been inoculated, raising concerns about vaccine hesitancy among those who are in contact with some of the individuals at highest risk of a severe infection."
20570,"&gt;As of Monday, about 37 percent of the more than 130,000 people working in “skilled nursing” facilities in the state have been vaccinated, according to the governor’s office."
20571,&gt;But 32 percent of the workers have declined to be vaccinated.
20572,"&gt;In some parts of the state, staff members who have declined outnumber those who have been vaccinated."
20573,"On Long Island, 46 percent declined while 34 percent have been vaccinated."
20574,"&gt;Officials cautioned that the vaccination process for long-term-care facilities was still in its early stages — the first of three inoculation phases concluded on Sunday, and many workers have not had the chance to get vaccinated."

20579,"&gt;The vaccination rate among residents was higher: 67 percent have been inoculated, while 16 percent have declined."

20675,This plays a part but I don’t think it’s everything.
20676,The UKs cases have gone back down in the last few weeks with similar measures to the previous lockdown.
20677,So the nature of the variant has no effect on similar measures working or not.
20678,"Instead I think you’d be better served to understand that the virus hits one person, disseminates, and dissipates over periods of time."

20681,Wearing masks isn’t doing everything safely.
20682,Not by a long shot.
20683,So masks maybe stop individual spread but are less helpful for ensuring it dissipates.
20684,Lockdowns like the UK one are the blunt instrument that ensures everyone is doing nothing instead of trying to make sure people do everything safely.

20723,Sucks that they were right.
20724,"But it's still an unfair argument to say that young people are not overwhelming hospitals today in the UK, so therefore they would not overwhelm the system if social distancing and masking were removed from the equation."
20725,"Even though deaths may go down due to younger adults having a lower risk of death, cases may go up if unvaccinated younger folks were to give up social distancing."
20726,"According to CDC, [up to 20%](https://www.cdc.gov/hantavirus/resources/covid-vs-hantavirus.html#:~:text=Although%20most%20healthy%20people%20will,19%20may%20require%20hospitalization.)"
20727,of young adults would require hospitalization.
20728,My point was that deaths is not the only metric we should be looking at.
20729,"Again, society might not agree, but a lot of society has trouble with looking at the bigger picture."
20730,"I certainly hope that vaccinations of only healthcare workers and older adults would be enough to knock spread down enough to reduce hospitalizations, but at the moment we haven't seen that happen and I haven't seen modeling predicting it."
20731,True.
20732,The irony is that Aldi is a German company.
20733,When in Rome...
20734,I’m going to go with my well placed source over some Twitter post.
20735,"I agree, but the issue of vaccine hesitancy among the African American community who rightly are a bit skeptical after Tuskegee is a major problem."
20736,"The African American community in this country has been CRUSHED by this pandemic, and there are so many in that community who are still so vulnerable but so vaccine skeptical."
20737,"If their time comes to get vaccinated and they’re still saying no, that’s a huge group of the most vulnerable in this country who desperately need the safety of a vaccine who are too scared."
20738,Vaccinating the NBA will help fight that vaccine hesitancy.
20739,"The question is, and is one only individuals can answer, is giving let’s say 5k vaccines to inspire millions of vaccine skeptical individuals to get vaccinated worth jumping those 5k in line?"
20740,I applied at Aldi.
20741,They didn’t want me
20742,When do you guys think anyone who wants it  (excluding minors) will be able to be vaccinated?
20743,I know Fauci was saying April but that seems overly optimistic to me.
20744,Thanks!
20745,"I mean, entire industries are shut down and food bank lines are miles long."
20746,I'm fairly sure you'd be able to find someone looking for a job.
20747,No.
20748,"In most jobs in the US, yes, you can take your sick days any time even if you aren't sick, but you risk being fired if you get caught or do it often."
20749,"Many employers in the US are afraid of breaking the (strict, complicated) rules regarding personal health information, so they don't ask about medical information when you call in sicj."
20750,It is also very easy for them to fire people without repercussions.
20751,"I have had quite a few employers who made me sign paperwork that they had a right to ask for doctor's notes when I called in sick, but then even when I have been out for three weeks for surgery the HR person declined to take a copy of my doctor's note when I offered it to them."
20752,"I have had salary jobs in the USA where my sick time was not limited, but my employer would find reasons to fire staff who were suspected of abusing the system and using it when they were not ill."
20753,"This was done even if their direct supervisor was happy with the employee and did not believe they were doing anything wrong, or if the employee was getting all of their work done from home and simply staying out of the office due to illness."
20754,"My current job is with a state government, and all this state's employees get 2 hours of sick added to a personal bank of leave per week."
20755,"If I call in sick, it uses up hours of sick leave equal to how many I was scheduled to work."
20756,"If my sick leave is used when it is negative three times, I will be fired."
20757,"What I am supposed to do if I have a chronic illness or need surgery etc is to anticipate that I will run out of sick leave and request a long term leave (which allows me to use up my vacation time after my sick leave runs out) or request unpaid leave, which is always approved for legitimate illnesses."
20758,Bots will never be as good as humans.
20759,They do not interpret what is said.
20760,I bought my mom the cutting knife set for Christmas.
20761,"I think she didn’t think Crofton was good but she cut herself &amp; it cut through frozen jowl meat so now they’re like, those are great knives!"
20762,"How about they show us all how to wait patiently, keeping social distance protocols as an example?"
20763,That would be a good PSA.
20764,I think they just want to be free to go out and party.
20765,Except that’s how scientists speak.
20766,“Suggests” means “we’ve found decent evidence to support this” not “ehh we think”
20767,This is what I’ve been doing.
20768,My parents were watching some entertainment news last night that made it seem like the plague was coming so I had to reaffirm them that numbers are actually looking good and that the variants aren’t of much concern.
20769,Lol
20770,"Well, it's kinda the duty of a governments to assure the health of their own people first."
20771,Let's assume the government in my country vaccinates only the old people and then helps to get the vaccine to other countries.
20772,"That might be the ethical thing to do but the people wont forget and the next government will likely be an ultra-right, probably antisemitic and racist one because that's a government which won't do something like this again."
20773,"Okay, send that crap to publix and let them handle it, again, why did this take a month to start, but get it going !"
20774,!
20775,We do not know long term effects of covid but theres a chance that it's shaving more years off an otherwise healthy 30 year old than would be gained by giving it to a nursing-home bound 80 year old.
20776,We have to aim at reducing infections to bring down deaths.
20777,"Otherwise we are just gaming stats and tricking others into a false sense of security, while giving the virus more chances to mutate."
20778,&gt; Why can't I wear a mask when I have a cold?
20779,Who told you that you can’t?
20780,You’re making up scenarios to feel oppressed.
20781,Honest question - can you trust the numbers out of Florida?
20782,Didn't they just arrest someone for not being willing to fudge the numbers?
20783,By February?
20784,"Sooo 100,000 deaths in the next two weeks?"
20785,Yeah no.
20786,Let's not spread unnecessary fear here.
20787,We have enough legitimate panic going around as is.
20788,That's normal for Aldi.
20789,"That way they ensure people return their carts, which means they don't have to pay somebody to pick up the carts from all over the parking lots, which results in lower prices."
20790,The founders of Aldi were real penny-pinchers.
20791,Huh.
20792,TIL
20793,"Global leadership from a country without universal healthcare, paying part of the salaries of the unemployed, and protecting small businesses?"
20794,Entitled yes.
20795,But will you get it probably not.
20796,"I think Aldi Nord and Süd are very, very similar in selection (in Germany that is), in fact I think most products are identical."
20797,"It's still pretty basic, but things like goat cheese and salmon are considered essentials, I guess (just don't expect to have a variety of brands to choose from)"
20798,"That's not natural, no."
20799,especially in our culture where eye contact is so crucial.
20800,Every key facial expression can be seen around the eyes.
20801,"Sunglasses are much more suspicious, and annoying when I'm talking to someone."
20802,You made no logical or thoughtful points--you simply just wrote some figures and expected me to make the same horseshit associations from your head that are put together with string and fucking thumbtacks.
20803,I agree that a lot of people are dying.
20804,Too many.
20805,This Trump/Republican administration made a mockery of this country and made a mockery of the people that supported this country.
20806,What a fucking travesty.
20807,"Yes, a vaccine will slow down the deaths."
20808,"Please, tell me exactly why a vaccine can speed up the ECONOMIC recovery if we can't even deliver the fucking vials of the vaccine on time."
20809,Tell me how it will get my families' jobs back.
20810,Tell me how it will get my friend's house back.
20811,Tell me how it will get my uncle back.
20812,Play by play.
20813,Tell me.
20814,Please.
20815,Why would it magically recover our economy?

20827,"If the Olympics are postponed until next year (which I hope it's the case), wouldn't dates overlap World's Cup?"
20828,"It would be interesting how they handle it, probably many people that attend both would only be attending one (and that's ignoring covid and economy, which is going to lower the numbers of attendance), so I guess that's why Japan keeps pushing for Olympics this year."
20829,Best reaction on a troll statement.
20830,Cudos.
20831,Well thats just the issue with rules.
20832,"They're generally not enforced by the ones that make them, so the spirit can sorta get lost in transit."
20833,To be fair those people were just waiting for a story like this to come out...
20834,Doesn't matter where it would of happened
20835,"Pfizer has never been keen on taking that data interpretation to the bank, period."
20836,Did Aldi really split the us in Aldi Nord and Aldi south?
20837,Lmao
20838,Gov.
20839,Cuomo is upset at Trump.
20840,"In other news, the Earth is round."
20841,We aren't going to catch every case through testing.
20842,Actual infections are 3x to 5x official tallies by most estimates posted on this sub.
20843,"For example, I personally know several families where everyone got sick at the same time but only one person got tested (and came back positive)."
20844,No what I meant is that tax breaks are state intervention just like communism intervenes in the economy.
20845,Both should be a no go.
20846,"Either lower taxes it they are to high, but do not give a part of the society a break while others carry the burden now or later."
20847,"Without universal healthcare, is one of the reasons the pandemic was so terrible."
20848,Yeah that's going to happen.
20849,When the numbers get low enough and people who have already had it or been vaccinated they will stop wearing masks in the grocery store unless it's super strictly enforced.
20850,"It's inevitable, and from that point forward most people will see others not wearing a mask and stop themselves."
20851,Yes and that is a total bullshit fuckup we have delivered.
20852,The EU loves to throw money on problems.
20853,"And the one problem which could be solved by throwing money at it, we are getting greedy."
20854,"And now politicans are begging people to stay at home, harden the restrictions and wonder why people don't comply anymore while at the same time we can't get vaccinated because we have almost no vaccine."
20855,This is such a bad situation.
20856,"You can't just say hey people we need you to stay home and then dont vaccinate, because vaccines are our only way out of this pandemic."
20857,I really wonder how long the CA government is going to try to keep everything locked down even past the vaccines being rolled out en masse.
20858,"People are FED UP here, especially those that dont live anywhere near SoCal."
20859,"I couldn't be further from an ""anti-vaxxer"" or something but these rules are are so completely arbitrary at this point and obviously we've got some of the worst numbers despite the strictest rules."
20860,"I know people whose taste is still pretty bad, but it's different for everyone"
20861,"Which is why its not going to be anything scientists will have an incentive to prove / disprove, and is why this percentage of overly paranoid population will be continued to be harvested for this type of media fear mongering."
20862,According to Worldometer we passed 400k on Friday.
20863,"Which is never an issue at this time, at this location"
20864,Is she with Banner in AZ?
20865,"I'm aware of that, but the store closes at 8PM."
20866,"It's empty at this time, and that's why I go then."
20867,I lose my taste aswell but it was just for a week
20868,People always die.
20869,It's not bizarre at all.
20870,"The safest society with the least deaths would be one where you can only travel from home to work via mass transportation, and everything else is remote, and you are locked in your home otherwise."
20871,Do you want a society like that?
20872,"No culture, no physical connections beyond maybe immediate family, no travel, no hobbies outside the home."

20881,yes in one year!!
20882,that is 10 in a week!
20883,now we have 15 deaths i a week from the vaccination
20884,I mean I have literally been to the Slave castles in West Africa and it was literally a trade between Europeans and African chiefs.
20885,You are historically illiterate as this entire conversation has proven
20886,"Jails, he refused to let non violent offenders out and even though there's not supposed to be any bail requirements for most charges, he and his prosecutors are still asking for it."
20887,"Also, ""it's going to get worse before it gets better""."
20888,"Like, what is even the point of saying that?"
20889,?
20890,"I know people here like to go on about how there is guaranteed to be mutations and all that, but I’ve read some things from Brazilians and Colombians about this variant and I think we should watch this one carefully and not dismiss it so quickly."
20891,"Boomers have been oppressing us for far longer than this pandemic, but it doesn’t really matter."
20892,What’s another 6 months of my youth at this point
20893,What have older people sacrificed for the younger generations?
20894,It's probably not a bad idea although unfortunately they could also just be motived by not having to cancel so many games and using that as cover
20895,Nah health insurers and life policies will quickly have clauses about covid.
20896,Either you pay more for your policy or a straight up exclusion.
20897,"Meantime the 65 plus crowd is waiting in line while these big babies fiddle and have to be persuaded with ""gifts"""
20898,There are so many irresponsible aspects of this article.
20899,Pfizer has data from a controlled study.
20900,You cannot compare the results from such a study to just giving the vaccine to people at large.
20901,Did you check and swab every single person before they got jabbed to rule out prior infection?
20902,Did you read where Pfizer said 'after 12 days' and make sure you are only looking at infections after 12 days?
20903,"Are you actually doing PCR's on every single vaccine participant to see when the onset is, not symptoms but actual infection?"
20904,Are the behaviors of people recently jabbed aligning with the behaviors of individuals from a trial who \*know\* it is 50-50 if they have the vaccine?
20905,Is this discussing persons presenting with \*any\* symptoms or specifically persons presenting with \*severe\* symptoms.
20906,It isn't even apples to oranges.
20907,Comparing a blinded trial to the colloquial outcome of at-large vaccination is like comparing apples to the concept of indemnity.
20908,See how what I just said makes no sense?
20909,Exactly.
20910,I can't teach math hard enough in my job.
20911,"I do try to get the next generation of engineers to think, however."
20912,People are misinformed on vaccines The vaccines don’t stop you from [getting](https://www.cnn.com/2021/01/08/health/covid-vaccinated-infected-wellness/index.html) mild COVID or [spreading](https://www.wsj.com/articles/does-getting-the-covid-19-vaccine-stop-you-spreading-it-scientists-dont-know-yet-11610989882) so I’m sorry but masks aren’t going so soon

20914,"Too much time negotiating, not enough time throwing money at the problem."
20915,Why the negativity?
20916,It's better than nothing and incentives people to get vaccinated if they are on the fence about it.
20917,Yes.
20918,"Young people mostly, whereas the right wing libertarianism is mostly a boomer problem."
20919,"Same shit, different asshole."
20920,A lot of people on here think the same thing.
20921,I got super downvoted into oblivion yesterday just because of that.

20940,I really hope your right.
20941,I think masks will business by business and not required everywhere you go.

20947,Around 40-45% of tested people have shown to be asymptomatic .
20948,It’s considered as high as 80% because of the obvious- a huge portion of people with no symptoms are not getting tested so there is no documentation of their case.
20949,In my limited social circle over half the people Who have tested positive had no symptoms and only knew they had it because their work required testing or they were about to have surgery and had to get a test.
20950,One family member out of 5 that contracted it - who was in the same household- never developed symptoms but tested positive.

20999,"In the same line of thinking, why bother wearing a mask when my chances of dying are trivially low?"

21001,Why bother not seeing my friends?

21017,It’s not my fault”.
21018,Why ?
21019,Imo it’s because he’s going to be held accountable when all the hedge fund managers lose massive amounts in the positions they took premised on his information.
21020,And you are right.
21021,"I’m assuming Johnson &amp; Johnson and Oxford /az COVID-19 vaccines will be safer because unlike Moderna and Pfizer, they have publicized detailed data."
21022,They have tested every subject weekly regardless of whether he or she reports symptoms.
21023,The types of vaccines they are developing are proven.
21024,They aren’t experimental.
21025,They aren’t like Moderna who prior to Covid had ZERO products on the market.
21026,"Literally not a single vaccine had ever passed all trials despite ample funding, valuations in the billions and a decade of time."
21027,Ftr - I’m not investing in pharmaceuticals.
21028,I’m investing in my health and my life.
21029,This isn’t about money to me.
21030,It’s about a vaccine creating neutralizing antibodies that were measured as high as 588 on day 59!
21031,"And after the second J&amp;J dose, it doubled or tripled that amount !"
21032,That’s the goal.
21033,So you should think “long and hard” about that.
21034,And the risks of unproven mRNA vaccines with unsubstantiated evidence of efficacy.
21035,"I agree with you, was in a playful mood just trying to joke."

21061,its been a month we gotta move past front lines if they dont want it.
21062,big if true
21063,Yea I'm not afraid I'll die from it but I'm scared about the long term health effects.
21064,"People I know don't want to get the vaccine and think it's dangerous, plus you would still have to wear a mask so they don't think it's worth it."
21065,The risk of long-term health effects from the vaccine is probably 100x or even 1000x lower than the chances of suffering long term health effects of the virus.
21066,Yet everyone thinks I'm crazy for wanting the vaccine....
21067,With any luck we'll be able to hold the B117 variant at bay with our continued vaccine rollout and this will be the last major wave.
21068,Agreed.
21069,"But I find it interesting that the only thing they did was for schools then, and now the only thing they aren’t doing is closing schools."
21070,As of right now basically.
21071,Most schools in our area are open and only some case where they have gone to full remote learning.
21072,"We luckily had the option for full remote learning but elementary schools were full time, little accommodation for the virus."
21073,Yet people on here will just tell you that you're spreading lies and fear on here.
21074,Thats fair.
21075,Within my immediate family and coworkers I would day 1/4 have already had covid.
21076,And a one third shot at covid apparently
21077,The difference now is vaccines are being deployed.
21078,Aldi and Lidl are all over in my area.
21079,"I love Aldi’s, they have a lot of cheap, healthy food and often even beat Walmart’s prices."
21080,I like their bag and cart policies as well.
21081,"Same, same."
21082,It's so scary and I feel like I'm on the verge of losing it.
21083,"These aren’t new strains these have been around and every “mutation” for which a single strain can have dozens is a new headline, the “new” strain in LA was discovered a year ago."
21084,Our surveillance is poor and any new strains developing today won’t be seen until they become dominant
21085,"I'll just say I think most places couldn't eradicate it no matter how hard they tried, and leave it at that."
21086,"Someday someone will come out with an eradication plan that convinces even people like me that it's possible, though."
21087,That will be a different ballgame.
21088,Is this an actual quote?
21089,"Lol

Post the link of so, I’ve gotta see it!"
21090,In the US Aldi doesn't pay as bad as other grocers so employees tend to be better at their jobs.
21091,I still think they are paid too little by how intense their job is.
21092,I keep watching these videos of people who refuse to wear a mask and respond with bullying and threats of violence.

21098,"The idea right now seems to be that we'll just send kids back to school and ""say fuck 'em, they'll all get it eventually and we'll just hope those long-term impacts aren't all that bad""."
21099,Fuck.
21100,That.
21101,Yet there are tons of people on here saying that it's extremely rare.
21102,And for the people who have been reinfected are going around spreading lies and fear.
21103,What is wrong with you people?
21104,You get so mad when people take this virus seriously.
21105,Just because you don’t doesn’t mean we all have to.
21106,My guess is none of your type of people have had COVID.
21107,Those of us who have know how seriously it needs to be taken.

21110,Flu was worse for me than Covid.
21111,And I don’t mean that in a way to downplay Covid at all.
21112,"Just that the flu is no joke whatsoever 

My nursing school made me go to a clinical rotation while I had the flu and I passed out like 3 hours in"
21113,Were?
21114,There was actually a study posted in /r/covid19 that basically concluded that there is about 90% immunity 7 months after an infection.

21652,I still remember the Italian doctors in summer who were noticing  milder illness on older  patients.
21653,Yeah... most people will quit giving what little of a shit they do once most of the vulnerable people get the jab and deaths and hospitalizations start to drop.

21659,"Well the more recent news on certain variants (everything's technically a variant, the original is like a long lost artifact now, so I emphasize certain variants and not all variants) is that they may be just different enough that the immune system doesn't recognize them as the same thing, and is, again, defenseless."

21666,We'll know that for sure very soon.
21667,"And once the vaccine is available to everyone who wants it some time in Q2 2021, there is no reason we can't return to normal."
21668,The only reason we are currently insisting people who were vaccinated continue wearing masks and social distancing is to keep people from lying about being vaccinated.

21737,I wouldn’t call that ruining life.
21738,And probably very high risk events like concerts would need to be postponed.
21739,Or we may have other advances like at-home testing and better treatments where it may not be necessary.

21742,We're doing 1M first doses a day right now.
21743,"So by May 15th (so a 2nd shot could be done by mid June), that's 120M more people that can be vaccinated."
21744,If we get a 50% increase in vaccine initializations by mid February that will be 165M by mid May.
21745,And that's if we make no more improvements and it takes an entire month to hit 1.5M first doses.

21805,If you don't want them just send them over to Europe 😂.
21806,"&gt; Your body isn't programmed to recognize each strain, whereas, the protein spike they use in the vaccine is present on all current strains."
21807,The protein spike is the thing mutating in many strains.
21808,Currently there is a lot of concern over those mutations being able to escape the vaccines just as much as they might escape antibodies.
21809,"So far, though, it is believed the vaccines will continue to be effective."
21810,"&gt; These vaccines don't ""simulate"" the virus in the way that traditional vaccines have before it."
21811,That's exactly what they do.

21818,At all.
21819,"And they’re not allowed to go home, they must stay in the hospital."
21820,We had a covid outbreak come in from parents and that’s why they did it - but I can’t imagine being alone with my critically ill child without my partner.
21821,So much cruelty and suffering with covid.

21853,"Can’t make people work for free, lol."
21854,But I imagine you *can* refuse to schedule them altogether (and fire them) if they aren’t vaccinated and don’t have a medical condition that precludes vaccination.
21855,"ADA only protects you if you *actually* have a condition, and “ignorant, selfish fuckwit” isn’t a recognized condition."
21856,"Should be, though."
21857,"Should be a recognized condition, I mean, but not something worthy of an exemption – just something worthy of treatment."
21858,Preferably with that exact wording for the diagnosis.
21859,They are talking about deaths directly caused by covid that weren’t categorized as such.
21860,Essentially some simple math shows that on avg the US has x deaths per year and in 2020 they had y.
21861,Subtracting y from x will give you excess deaths compared to normal years.
21862,This excess death number is higher than the total reported death by a significant amount.

21871,Companies like Trader Joe and Aldi have offered financial incentives for employees who get the vaccine.
21872,I don't think it's a legal problem.
21873,i think the thing is that countries ordered WAAAAY more than they needed.
21874,The US only needed around 320 million.
21875,they have ordered around 600-800 million.
21876,"If a lot of the extra doses would have been delivered to all countries earlier, then everyone benefits."
21877,"&amp;nbsp;

The US (and other countries) will now get most of the vaccines as early as possible, hogging it all up to ensure their people are vaccinated first while leaving the rest of the world ""waiting"" for them to start ""giving"" away."
21878,"&amp;nbsp;

Its an understandable argument both ways."
21879,The ones with money want to ensure they get the most and quickest amounts first.
21880,"The other side of the argument is that if they didn't hoard all of the vaccines, a lot of the smaller countries that only have 4-15 million in population would then be vaccinated alongside the ""regular"" amount in the wealthier countries."
21881,"Both sides have merit but unfortunately, there are ""borders"" everywhere and you'll fight for yours over anyone elses."
21882,the thinking is simply wrong.
21883,If wearing a mask even has a CHANCE to prevent the spread of something that is way deadlier then the flu... Everyone should volunteer to do for personal responsibility.
21884,Also.
21885,"Perhaps the government can be given a liitle bit of leeway for getting some things wrong in the early parts of the pandemic, because they had zero chance to study it yet?"
21886,"No said 94% isn't substantial, that doesn't change the fact thst vaccinated persons will need to continue to wear a mask and social distance as they can still get covid19, and still pass it on to others."
21887,So by that logic it’s distancing forever.
21888,Really because nothing is 100%.
21889,Just light a match to life right?

21891,There’s a brilliant idea: tax write offs for companies that vaccinate their employees.
21892,"&gt;I simply commented to raise awareness that this virus does not discriminate when it comes to age

21903,"However in pure Aldi style, workers will need to bring their own bandaid or pay 7¢ for one at checkout."
21904,The answer is you sell it to the ones who are actually able to pay for it.
21905,The unfortunate truth is even though the vaccines are cheap for the rich nations they are somewhat expensive for poorer nations.
21906,At least the more expensive vaccines will have to be bought by someone else for the poorest nations.

21924,I know a couple old friends who have spoken to me that have “come out” via DM to me but say they are waiting till post-covid to come out to their parents as they want an escape plan.
21925,"If you had asked me in March, I would’ve predicted by Fall most restrictions would be lifted, and that we wouldn’t be waiting till a vaccine, because that could take years as far as we knew back then."
21926,I never would’ve imagined the US still being in panic mode in 10 months.
21927,[removed]
21928,"How would we explain the surge from this time last year to, say, March 2020?"
21929,So we went from a few cases (because obviously we were just learning about it) to the tens of thousands within a few months and then everything got shut down.
21930,"Holiday travel is over, but we are entering a period in the northern hemisphere where a great portion of its inhabitants will be confined to indoor spaces."
21931,Like last year.
21932,But last year we had a few tens of thousands of people infected.
21933,This year we have millions.
21934,"I know those already infected are considered immune currently, but there are still far more that haven't been infected."
21935,I'm just rambling.
21936,Sorry.
21937,I'm glad for the seemingly good news here but it doesn't add up in my head to be really great news like I think it should be.
21938,I'm just trying to understand.
21939,They are the only one that I’ve seen actual test results confirming it.
21940,But both the approved ones work similarly enough that in theory if one works on a variant the other should.
21941,"Ok, so if that's true, what are we supposed to do?"
21942,"Just stay closed forever, I feel like we are just running out of options if we dont get a good percentage of people vaccinated."
21943,The government is paying for the vaccine and most of the supplies to administer.
21944,They are not paying the administration fee.
21945,"If you have private insurance, they pay the fee."
21946,"If you have medicare part B, they pay the fee."
21947,"If you have no insurance, the site will not be paid the fee (the patient is not charged)."
21948,Exactly.
21949,That’s why this messaging is absurd.
21950,Of course being infected or getting the vaccine will greatly reduce transmission.
21951,It’s the only thing that makes sense

21953,"Given the Chinese study found confirmed reinfection in about 2.5% of cases within 60 days of initial infection this is sad, but a trend we will see more of."
21954,[deleted]
21955,There were absolutely variants 8 months ago.
21956,"The difference is it just became convenient for media outlets to start reporting on them for new, exciting headline clickbait last month because vaccinations had been approved and many places had started immunizing people."
21957,"Minor caveat, asymptomatic are contagious, but often for a shorter hard to determine timespan."
21958,Symptomatic people have a semi-definable point for highest infectivity risk days.
21959,"The quote in the article says ""by the middle of February."""
21960,I'm sorry to hear that.
21961,Maybe something Biden will change?
21962,(We can hope..)
21963,is this the new narrative from your skeptic hangout?
21964,"Oh hey, a young ideologue appears!"
21965,"&amp;#x200B;

Look, I'm not here to debate about the merits about capitalism vs. other economic systems, or whether the United States effectively enforces its laws."
21966,I'm speaking practically.
21967,"Do we hold back on vaccinating people because others cannot, because there are other nations that cannot or will not, or do we vaccinate who we can now?"
21968,[deleted]
21969,It completely discredits interestingengineering.com as a media outlet.
21970,"If you clicked on the Reuters report you'll see it's phase 1/2 with 100 participants and ""effective"" means immunogenic."
21971,"I mean, I go into anaphylactic shock from cashews."
21972,"I was always able to eat them, until one day, I was eating cashew chicken, and went into anaphylaxis."
21973,Are you going to avoid cashews forever because other people have developed a severe reaction to cashews?
21974,Not from China - a travel across Europe.
21975,"I know that would have been a hard sell, but better than what happened without."
21976,Every day since the distribution campaign the number of vaccinations has dramatically outpaced the number of infections.
21977,"Of course, the media would rather you focus on the latter statistic."
21978,Yes - I have read that.
21979,They screen for symptomatic COVID at validate it via a PCR test.
21980,We see a 94% reduction in symptomatic COVID from the vaccine.
21981,"In that vaccinated group, it is also likely that the vaccine prevented asymptomatic infection to some extent based on what we know about levels of neutralizing antibodies and cell-based immunity, but these studies were not powered to detect that."
21982,I think it's hilarious how quick you all are to justify your selfishness and lack of care to help others but I didn't expect otherwise.
21983,I'm really sorry you've gone through that.
21984,That brain fog is extremely common in people with long covid.
21985,Question... did your taste and smell come back?
21986,You continue to put a face mask on and you get vaccinated so you can help someone else who cannot take it alive.
21987,I have a coworker who is immunocompromised and our whole team is doing everything we can to keep him safe.
21988,So we do all we can to protect him.
21989,That means masked up for 9 straight hours.
21990,That means we all get vaccinated when it's available.
21991,It would be nice if he didn't have to work at all but he needs to eat and pay rent.
21992,So we do the best we can.
21993,And we need others like yourself to do your part and not say fuck it because you might not die from it but we know people like my coworker will.
21994,Lmao youre such a stupid jerk aint you.
21995,All these are baised sites
21996,That is not entirely true.
21997,"There is plenty of time as vaccine efficacy will be reduced in small steps as the virus evolves, not go from 95 % to zero in a matter of months."
21998,"Klaus Cichutek, head of the German Paul-Ehrlich-Institut, which is a government agency in charge of vaccine distribution, has said that no extensive testing for an updated vaccine will be required."
21999,"If Germany of all countries can skip prolonged bureaucratic procedures, so can everyone else."
22000,"Also, Moderna's CEO said something similar, though I'll admit you'd have to take this with a grain of salt, as he sells the stuff."
22001,"I'm just here to say that no matter what anyone thinks about this scenario, a young man died, and I am sad for him and his family."
22002,We need these vaccines to roll out ASAP because relying on herd-immunity is getting people killed.
22003,"I have lost two friends, myself, and I am so utterly sad and lonely now."
22004,I'm so worn out.
22005,"I don't know if this child got a second case of Covid or if his symptoms randomly returned and killed him, but what I do know is that the vaccines are the only legitimate way forward right now."

22007,I'm still not nearly the same.

22014,Thanks.
22015,Definitely a terrible translation job by Reuters.
22016,Yes
22017,That's the whole mess with the people dying from a disease.
22018,Do people who died in an accident related to the symptom of the disease count as dead from the disease ?
22019,What about someone feeling weak due to covid and falling down the stairs ?
22020,No it doesn't.
22021,The data from Israel suggests exactly what was found in the trial data; that persons that are vaccinated still contract COVID19 and still give it to other people.
22022,"Transmission maybe reduced, but it isn't eliminated."
22023,Masks and social distancing are still required by vaccinated persons for these reasons.
22024,Why do you say that getting a vaccine will greatly reduce transmission?
22025,"What if it only ensures that you don't get sick, but you're just as likely to spread it."
22026,Does it make sense that not only that you won't get sick if infected but you also won't be able to spread the virus after being vaccinated?
22027,Maybe.
22028,But there's no proof yet.
22029,It wasn't really tested as it is much more difficult to track than whether vaccine prevents a person who received it from getting sick.
22030,I'm really having a hard time understanding what part of messaging is absurd?
22031,Maybe it's just a misunderstanding between us.
22032,How come no one is recommending cooking your own food?
22033,I mean this sounds legit.
22034,It's just an incentive.
22035,How will wearing a mask and avoiding others reduce the obesity and smoking rates?
22036,Here in Ireland they had to advise people 2-3 weeks back to not get tested unless they were a close contact of a confirmed case because there was too much strain on testing labs.
22037,"So if you were working with only a suspected case you didn't need a test until they tested positive, which takes 4-5 days."
22038,"Putting more strain on them now would be ill advised, though I know where you are coming from."
22039,"It would speed up the process of reopening, but considering the larger antibody response to the vaccine, it would be better for everyone to get the vaccine all within a few months to a year instead of relying on antibodies from last March."
22040,Lol i think i have more important things to do than argue with a random moron.
22041,Imma get the covaxin only.
22042,If you don't like it.
22043,"Just don't take it,  but don't spread fucking misinfo here"
22044,Not at all.
22045,The damage to the economy is done.
22046,Reducing the chance of someone contracting this virus will not magically give them a job or give them their house back.

22139,It is just unbelievable!
22140,They're not completely wrong - there have been spikes associated with the holidays - they are just overshadowed by the general trend in the virus.
22141,If you look at the case counts from any of the states in the Midwest (see [https://covidtracking.com/data/charts/all-metrics-per-state](https://covidtracking.com/data/charts/all-metrics-per-state)) you can tell exactly where Thanksgiving and Christmas fall.
22142,There are obvious spikes in the case counts around those holidays.
22143,The severity of those spikes is massively overstated though.
22144,The spikes don't come close to reversing the general negative trend of case counts and the increase in cases only lasts a couple of weeks before the spike is gone and the downward progression in case counts has resumed.
22145,"We've had a lot of coverage recently about the spikes, but that is mostly either people being ignorant or lying to generate clicks/inspire fear/whatever."
22146,The increase we saw after Thanksgiving was almost entirely due to increasing cases in warm weather states that were already happening (particularly California) and had almost nothing to do with the holiday.
22147,I pay close to 40% in taxes in Canada and i expect them to give me a vaccine before someone in a poorer country gets it.
22148,Nobody wants to admit that the reason a lot of these poorer countries are poor is because they have crooked leaders.

22154,"**If** a vaccine doesn’t not prevent spread of covid (so vaccinated and unvaccinated both pass covid at the same rate), then how does a young person who is vaccinated decrease the risk to an immunocompromised person compared to an unvaccinated person?"
22155,This was the initial question.
22156,You seem to think they can.
22157,"Please respond with something other than how I’m a heartless being, as that really isn’t part of the discussion"
22158,"Please, tell me how bad things are for you in Canada."
22159,Seems like a really bad basis.
22160,"I mean, he's given himself a lot of wiggle room with his wording ""demand will get soft,"" but I think we won't have much trouble getting out more COVID vaccines than flu vaccines."
22161,"[56% of Americans are already willing to take it as soon as available with another 22% who are waiting for others first](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/health/2021/01/18/poll-covid-vaccine-acceptance-rises-pessimism-future-suffolk-poll/4196840001/)

22201,"Don't worry, that narrative will change in two days - they'll start touting how successful it is after Wednesday."
22202,It will be probably very hard to convince people to wear masks when the hospitalizations are down and people are vaccinated
22203,"Sorry, but this is nonsense."
22204,It's been widely accepted that the virus will be endemic.
22205,Furthermore Pfizer and Moderna have efficacy of over 90% as is.
22206,There really isn't much that can be improved upon.
22207,"Currently vaccines that are more easily storable and dosable (nasal, pill, etc.)"
22208,are being looked into.
22209,But it doesn't get much better than than 94-95% efficacy.
22210,Remember that polio and measles are still endemic despite highly effective vaccines.
22211,"Either way, you don't need to completely stop spread within all people in order to end a pandemic."
22212,Is it the case though?
22213,Talking about Italy here.
22214,"Before summer, ""critical"" ICU occupancy was set to be 50%."
22215,They changed it silently to be 40% around October.
22216,They changed it again around Christmas to be 30%.
22217,"The color zone system was established around end October, backed by a set of rules that are questionable to say the least."
22218,"They've updated it so that of Rt in a region is more than 1, the region get a ""orange"" status."
22219,Orange means pretty much hard lockdown.
22220,"Given that Rt itself is not really cause of concern (if you have 10 cases and Rt is 1.2, you have 12 cases the day after) and Rt was [way above 1](https://rt-italy.live/regione/lombardia/) for a good period during summer, you would expect some regions like Lombardy to basically never go back to something that resembles normal."
22221,"Right now Lombardy is ""Red""."
22222,Means noone gets out of the house except some specific cases.
22223,"Hospitals are empty, cases have been stable for more than 3 weeks."
22224,Why the lockdowns then?
22225,"In all this, people haven't fought back."
22226,I talk with people on the regular and they overwhelmingly support lockdowns.
22227,"We haven't even been offered an exit plan, they just say ""you stay home until we decide so""."
22228,"You have ""virologists"" on tv calling for an hard lockdown of one month for the whole country while hospitals are empty and cases are the lowest they have been since October."
22229,I don't see a way out of this.
22230,Yeah.
22231,It's a more useful comparison if you only look at the second waves.

22351,Deaths/day is a similar story only much more stark in how much worse things are in January than December.
22352,"Yes, both 7-day averages (new cases and deaths per day) have a slight downward trend over the past couple days, but nothing above noise level."
22353,We had a similar downward trend a couple weeks ago that turned around to reach new heights of awful.

22445,My 8 year old is the only 2nd grader in her school taking advantage of it (though it is a very small school with about 20 kids per grade).
22446,I follow the schools' social media accounts and they'll play lip service to social distancing and masking requirements and then turn around and post pictures of maskless kids in enclosed classrooms.

22542,"Sad, and pathetic that so many people were fine with it happening."
22543,"Not something that is likely to be popular, but I find it interesting that the main author lists no conflict of interests."
22544,"A quick look at open secrets site:

https://www.opensecrets.org/donor-lookup/results?name=carl+latkin

Shows thousands of dollars in donations to democrats or democratic causes."
22545,"No conflict of interest, huh?"
22546,Interesting.
22547,I remember people calling bullshit when the projected number was 60 - 70K.
22548,Those people are still calling bullshit on the 400K projection.
22549,"They will never change, or admit how wrong they have been all the way through this disaster."
22550,"Face it, we have reached the worst case scenario, and a huge portion of Americans just don't care."

22552,Water is wet
22553,People have outright lost there minds and the conspiracies are flourishing under lockdowns
22554,Bidens admin has a real mess to clean up.
22555,this is a disaster.
22556,"I've been optimistic, but I'm pretty down today after reading the twitter thread by the Bloom lab concerning their study in immunity escape by the SA varient."
22557,I just wish we knew the degree to which these varients will affect the efficacy of the vaccines.
22558,"I'm here in LA, so I'm desperate to see a light at the end of the tunnel."

22560,Israel is also testing a lot more than the US (or most other countries for that matter).
22561,They have been doing over 100K tests a day (at least on weekdays) which is over 1% of the population.
22562,Would be like the US doing over 3.3 million tests a day.
22563,The positivity rate has always been lower than the US (even now it's 9-10%).
22564,This is a false argument because we have scientific data to prove that 99% of vasectomies are successful.
22565,"We don't have data on whether the covid vaccines stop transmission just yet, but we will soon."

22569,"By the time I boycott every store, I'll starve."
22570,Wish I could live off the land.
22571,This is the way to get people to take the vaccine!
22572,I would take it regardless but for those who just don’t see value in it or just are too lazy will be motivated if their company paid them to take it.
22573,"Maybe have incentives like more paid time off, etc...I hope to see this widespread!"
22574,!
22575,but actually this is a good point.
22576,"the same way you get the flu, is how you get covid and other airborne diseases."
22577,/u/FredoSosa might've got lucky and got the flu and not covid but it could've been covid.
22578,"Yep, what’s one more “put my life on hold so boomers can live easier” at this point."
22579,Just hold on while boomers don’t retire.
22580,Just hold on while boomers buy up all the housing.
22581,Just hold on while I pay into social security and probably won’t get any of the benefits.
22582,Just hold on another half a year while boomers get vaccinated.
22583,They really got us good lol
22584,Plus a free vaccine!
22585,What are you trying to say?
22586,I hope we can come out better.
22587,But seeing how many younger folks are feeling hopeless and down and growing resentful I don’t have a good feeling about this at all.
22588,Maybe I’m pessimistic because seeing how conspiracies started 10 years ago and how it as evolved since then I don’t think we are heading in a good direction even when we get over this virus
22589,bold take
