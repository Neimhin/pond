10,I keep remembering that Mark Cuban and Bill Gates both said this at the beginning.
11,"Mar 24, 2020 [https://www.vox.com/recode/2020/3/24/21192638/coronavirus-bill-gates-trump-reopen-business](https://www.vox.com/recode/2020/3/24/21192638/coronavirus-bill-gates-trump-reopen-business)

 Bill Gates says *we can't* restart the *economy* soon and simply “ignore that *pile of bodies* over in the corner”."
12,"Cant find the Cuban Quote, but it was basically the same thing."
13,"More americans are in poverty which leads to obesity when fast food is cheapest option

Canada doesnt have huge corn syrup lobbies either."
14,&gt; Something like 1 in 5 adults in Texas are on probation or parole.
15,Sorry but that does not pencil out.
16,"Running some quick math:

* the 2020 Census numbers are in and peg [the population of Texas at 29,360,759](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas)

* The [Census QuickFacts for Texas](https://www.census.gov/quickfacts/TX) indicates 25.5% of the state's pop are minors."
17,"Therefore 74.5% are adults, or 21,873,765

* [this Prison Legal News article](https://www.prisonlegalnews.org/news/2020/feb/4/decrease-prison-population-texas-must-increase-parole-rate/) seems legit, fairly timely (last February) and indicates 482,000 Texans are on parole or probation."
18,"That works out to about 2.2% of Texas adults -- nowhere close to ""1 in 5"" or 20 percent."

22,Classic Texas.
23,"*Posse Comitatus Act,* but Congress can authorize exceptions and the President has a decent amount of discretion too."
24,"The original idea was to end Army involvement in state governments, where they had been suppressing the KKK and enforcing the end of slavery."
25,"That's why the Dixiecrats wanted the  Army's power in domestic politics curbed, so they could get around enforcing white supremacy through their own local police departments."
26,"But northerners (who, remember, were very much in the late age of steam) weren't too interested until the election of 1876."
27,It was *fiercely* contested and incredibly close.
28,"The Democrats used paramilitary wings, the Republicans ran an incredibly boring candidate and an attack campaign calling Democrats rebels."
29,So you had a boring centrist party of liberal name-calling and an openly racist right-wing party fight each other to a standstill.
30,"The compromise was that the boring Republican (Hayes) would be president, but he would stand down the Army and let the Democrats do whatever they pleased with the South."
31,(Which was basically low-grade terrorism and reestablishing aparthood.)
32,But that summer the economic left wing - labor unions - took the initiative to throw huge protests and probably the closest America has ever been to a general strike.
33,(Imagine antifa's black bloc but the backbone is dudes who shovel coal and lay steel for a living.)
34,*Nobody* with any money or power wanted that.
35,They were imagining something the Paris Commune.
36,So Hayes called out the Army for one last big hurrah.
37,"By the way, he did that because West Virginia's militiamen refused to shoot strikers."
38,Good on them for refusing an unlawful order.
39,"Congress was worried that Hayes might have finally found his testicular fortitude, so both parties passed the Posse Comitatus Act to rein him in."
40,So yeah.
41,"Congress actually telling the President ""no,"" burly syndicalist Catholic railworkers, liberal Republicans and white-pride Democrats."
42,America has changed a lot  since the military was kicked out of domestic peacekeeping.
43,"It was probably for the best, but it's some crazy historical context."

71,Ok.
72,I will concede your first point.
73,It was a misinterpretation on my part.
74,"I also do believe that 87k cases are almost certainly too low, but I don't think it's necessarily due to intentional misreporting, but rather lack of testing."
75,I think that the situation back then was probably worse than it was said to be.
76,"There were whispers of things being far worse, although I don't think anything conclusive has come out."

79,They have removed a significant amount of restrictions.
80,Heck there are even foreigners who can confirm that large crowds were gathering for New Years parties.

87,We did everything we were told to do.
88,"Stayed home, distanced, only went out when necessary, yet we still got COVID."
89,"People, please wear your damn mask and stay home."
90,I remember reading early on that admitting airborne transmission would force the government to provide better protection to health workers than if they claimed it was not airborne.
91,But that was probably just someone's musings on the topic.
92,In Texas?
93,Ya they don't care about trampling over people's rights as long as their state prisons stay full and the execution chair stays warm.
94,The only time I have been in an elevator since this started was after a surgery.
95,Apparently I tried to talk him into letting me take the stairs.
96,There is a lockdown in effect currently in Southern California.

98,And 1/3 doesn't follow it 100%.
99,"The latter believe that they can just do this ""one"" social function or this ""one"" family gathering."
100,Somehow (trump) the virus became politicized.
101,"It's very interesting and sad to see so many people who deny covid even exists, to the point of arguing with healthcare workers even while sick with the disease."

115,"I get it, it sucks, its been a long time."
116,"But if you think were going to ""open up"" and go back to ""normal"" your mistaken."
117,Things arent ever going to be the same and rushing into that doesnt do anything other than put more people at risk.

133,"""*

Hopefully we find a better way to mitigate this than lockdowns by then."
134,"I agree that there is a high probability that Covid will become endemic, but it seems that there are other long term options besides lockdowns."
135,"I'm thinking getting better at testing, contact tracing, and quarantines once we are not behind the 8 ball might be a long term solution preferable to intermittent lockdowns."
136,"We can all find ""experts"" who side with our own opinion and disagree with the opposition."

279,"Trusting the authorities is only a part of it, we also need authorities that know what they are doing."

307,"That's more understandable, but to those who don't understand that doctors aren't experts and you should always get a second opinion before receiving treatment *(assuming 70% of population)* it freaks you out to hear that your doctor could be wrong, or the science doesn't pan out."

343,The risk of serious side effects from the COVID vaccine is *far far* less than the risk of *death* (let alone serious illness) from COVID.
344,"At the rate the Western world is acquiring and transmitting SARS-CoV-2, it is extremely unlikely that you will be able to avoid infection indefinitely without vaccination."
345,I urge you to please reconsider your stance and consult with your doctor about your concerns with your own vaccination.
346,If your husband cannot vaccinate then vaccinating yourself will make him safer.
347,Boris literally said on TV that would could... it was also on the Gov website.
348,The entire country no matter what teir could mix for at least Christmas day.
349,"Nobody knows the future, but I think we'll see numerous new variants in the coming weeks and months."
350,Variants that may have as many or more mutations than the British variant.
351,"There obviously cannot be any vaccine resistance now because we barely started vaccinating, but with tens of millions of infected and millions of vaccinated with partial immunity, it would be surprising if there weren't some hosts in which the virus mutates and evades the vaccine."
352,"I worry that the combination of a low-efficacy vaccine together with the 1-shot vaccination strategy and new variants could result in limited immunity in numerous hosts, in which the virus may evade the vaccine."
353,"&gt; Nope, The flu immunity lasts for a lifetime, with all known current viruses immunity lasts for six to 24 months."
354,Measles infection leads to life long immunity.
355,"With no confirmed DEATHS, or even close to death!"
356,"If the same amount of people got Covid, as there are vaccinated, there would be at least 75000k more dead people."
357,"(15mil vaccinated, 0.5%ifr- this is a very low estimate because most people given the vaccine were high-risk individuals, so more like 200k-500k saved lives)"
358,"Target is 100 million shots, 50 million people."
359,And it's not clear whether that was just the holiday bump or it's actually caused by the lessening of restrictions.
360,Cases are still at half of what they were at the November peak.
361,It would be very unusual to see another peak of that magnitude.
362,No other state has seen a curve like that this close in time.
363,[removed]
364,Having children that you can’t provide for is immoral.
365,"Yes, it's possible patients may have died at the same time by coincidence not due to the hospital running lout of oxygen, however, it is not the first time that a hospital in Egypt or other countries, with poor heath services, have run out of oxygen."
366,Even in the UK and the US I have heard of hospitals running low.
367,So it is plausible that they died due to a lack of oxygen.
368,"Here's Peru:

[https://youtu.be/DK0\_mqqyRHA](https://youtu.be/DK0_mqqyRHA)"
369,"Yes we've got 12 times the population, but we've got considerably more than 12 times the number of cases...

A lot of people said NZ's approach simply wouldn't work when they started."
370,"- that they were over-reacting, that it would have too much of an impact on the country, that it was impossible to control the spread etc."
371,It's true that we're more bigger and more connected than NZ are.
372,And maybe their strategy wouldn't have worked quite as well here as it did there.
373,"But if we'd had the courage to take a similar approach, it would almost certainly have worked *vastly* better than the debacle we've got now."
374,"If a teenager now gets weakened arteries from Covid and dies of a stroke in his 50s, does Covid get credit?"
375,No vaccines are forever.
376,"Also, as of now, we have no long lasting vaccine against any Corona virus."
377,"Crazy isn't it, and apparently we're taking it seriously in comparison to the US."
378,Moses: one more plague.
379,"The way some old people talk, you'd have to believe the Wendy's building that was set on fire is equal to at least one 9/11."
380,There's a pandemic.
381,People are dying.
382,A study in the UK showed that teachers are over 300% more likely to get covid than the general population.
383,In person school isn't recommended until community spread is under control.
384,"Even in person there's no way to do real teaching that works (no cooperative learning, no labs, paper isn't even recommended, most places have atrocious class sizes so can't be spread out, teachers have to wear lots of ppe to be safe, etc etc, it's not just ""business as usual"")

Sorry not sorry that teachers value LIFE more than the risk and restrictions of in person learning."
385,This little opinion piece does nothing to convince me otherwise.
386,It's just some angry anti union guy mouthing off and frankly that's worthless.
387,100x?
388,How long a run are we talking?
389,Like 500 years?
390,It's frustrating that a long-term study into this disease requires patients who had it ten years ago.
391,"We really do have to wait to find out how long immunity lasts, and how long aftereffects last."
392,Plenty of other nurses?
393,You sure about that?
394,Everywhere desperately needs more to deal with the surge right now.
395,FDA regulations prevent it from being advertised to prevent spread until it can be proven.
396,Have people already forgot that China has been a actively against any major or international investigation to find the source/origin of Covid?
397,"Like, it has been on the news."
398,"Also, it has been a year."
399,Like WTF.
400,"So should the moderators remove the ""Good News"" flair then?"
401,[deleted]
402,As opposed to China news?
403,🤣🤣🤣
404,"Or even better, the internet!"
405,Have you seen how cheap the vaccine will be for us compared to the western countries?
406,"This is why, the scale at which India has to vaccinate along with the state of healthcare system compared to the developed countries poses a much harder challenge."
407,Have some faith in our country.
408,Lol did you even bother reading?
409,You should really just take the time to actually read a post before commenting.

411,"More likely due to British diplomats, given that it broke out where all the lorry drivers to and from Europe were being stopped and getting out of their lorry cabins."
412,Antarctica had zero COVID deaths.
413,"&gt;”Must be awful to hate your own country so much.”

415,"Science is uncertainty, almost by definition."
416,Thank you for taking time to explain it this way.
417,"I’ve heard so many different studies and a lot of them contradict each other, so I never which one to put stock into."
418,Not to mention higher math (percentage and statistics) have always been a bit difficult for me and I have no problem admitting that I don’t understand all the science and math behind these studies.
419,"While I appreciate your opinion, for some it just isn’t that easy."
420,We have to have a very in-depth discussion with our physicians considering my husband had a full blown seizure with a DTaP booster 2 years ago.
421,"I, however, will vaccinate when it is my turn, but would NEVER do it at a pharmacy."
422,"After my husband’s ordeal, not in a million years."
423,He was lucky to be in an Urgent Care attached to an ER.
424,There was no fever and no history with any other vaccine he received in his 53+ years.
425,He hasn’t had a seizure since and all follow up neurological testing was negative.
426,[removed]
427,Lol.
428,Not the least bit bothered.
429,I remember when this whole thing started...everyone was saying China can't be lying and they are actually very open about this and yet look at where we are today.
430,😜
431,[removed]
432,Are you willing to sacrifice the life of the US citizen who gets infected because an outbreak at a plant that employs undocumented immigrants working in close quarters turns into a superspreader event that infects the rest of the town?
433,What about the US citizen who dies of a heart attack because there is no room in the ER because there are undocumented workers with COVID symptoms being treated and the ER doesn't check immigration status before they begin treatment.
434,How did the vaccine manufactures come up with a time scale for the second dose ?
435,They must have ran some tests ?
436,The UK has Johnson + 60m population.
437,"Like i said, i dont wanna take anything away from New Zealands achievement."
438,Access to birth control is not as widespread in poorer countries as it is in wealthier countries and many women can develop problems from birth control.
439,Maybe get out the bubble more and learn things
440,"Been doing it 4 times a week (not by choice but to avoid starving) since May, only had one weekend of 100 degree fever over the summer knock on wood."
441,It WAS already rationed...doctors and nurses are caring for many more patients than before...they don't even like check up on you anymore just look at monitors and logs
442,This!
443,In 10 days I worry we’ll be at or above 1200 / day.
444,I hate being right.
445,😥
446,My husband tested positive after being admitted to hospital after we were in a vehicle crash.
447,"He had symptoms 3 weeks prior, quarantined for 2 weeks."
448,"My daughter and I, tested negative during his quarantined period and after vehicle crash."
449,Just sharing my experiences.
450,Your bf might be good.
451,[deleted]
452,Amazing.
453,Captain Hindsight
454,Nope I’d call it justice.
455,Because most people ready to call out people are the ones who haven’t got it.
456,Better that only 4 million people get it but in some super correct order than 30 million people get it at the same timeframe
457,Maybe its normal to keep patients attached to monitors after they've passed or it was just coincidence they all died in such a short timeframe.
458,"It's not just healthcare, it's just absolutely everywhere."
459,I know healthcare should be held to a higher standard for these things but information is readily available and thrown in everyone's faces about what to do to prevent spread and we ignore it.
460,"The reality is western society has created generations of people that are taught to ""win"" over others and that they are special."
461,"Everyone thinks they know better, everyone thinks it won't happen to them, everyone thinks they can be the exception, everyone thinks their minor inconvenience is a big deal."
462,It's easy to get mad over the rich fucks like this guy doing it but let's be honest it's rich AND poor living like they are the exception to the rules.
463,"Our whole society is built with these people, that's why we're having to go through this pandemic the hard way instead of having the success of places like Taiwan."
464,"Even in my province, we're poor + low population and have been very lucky to have barely been affected by the pandemic (1-2 cases per days, often 0) but what happened?"
465,"Everyone traveled for the holidays and held New Years parties, and now we have 30+ cases yesterday and again today, and it will blow up to probably hundreds a day by next week."
466,This pandemic has really made me lose respect for the way millions of people choose to live.
467,"A lot of people I would've previously considered the imagine of success such as entrepreneurs and people engaged in building a better life for themselves, etc I see today are unable to follow basic rules and I just see them as people who need more things and attention all the time."
468,People unable to settle down and follow very simple rules for a few months or a year putting their vain wants at the forefront even when they put others' lives at risk by doing so
469,I explained that in the second part of my comment if you had read it.
470,A lot of those people will be without jobs soon I would guess.

478,The upvote and downvote buttons just make the echo chamber effect even worse.
479,"Posts that reflect of the worldview of the sub rise to the top and are presented as authoritative, and posts that reflect a different worldview get silenced."
480,"Eventually, people who get downvoted all the time leave the sub and set up their own, where the same effect happens in reverse."
481,And they can also be manipulated for deliberate misinformation purposes.
482,"For example, posts on this sub that paint China in a bad light will sometimes get dozens of downvotes within an hour of being posted, ensuring that they're less visible."
483,A move for only the people in the capitol.

488,"We've fucked up a load of things in the UK, but we do a lot of sequencing work on most outbreaks of everything, so it could well be that we spotted it rather than it came to be here."
489,A lot of the sequencing for outbreaks of Ebola and Sars was done here too
490,Looks like you do not know how vaccines work.
491,Vaccines *do* stop the spread by inducing herd immunity.
492,Do a little research on how vaccines work.
493,"Vaccines do not just stop a vaccinated person from getting ill. A vaccinated person has immunity, and can therefore not spread the virus."
494,"It is why your dog's rabies vaccine doesn't just protect him, it protects you and anyone who might get bitten by him."
495,You actually believe these experts do not know that?
496,They wouldn't have their medical and epidemiological degrees if they didn't.
497,"It will only take out 0.2% of the population in the short run, but I could see 10 or even 100x that in the long run."
498,"Obviously not perfect for getting complete extinction, but quite a reasonable score for a virus that doesn’t have someone actively evolving symptoms."
499,They do have a choice they can choose to work somewhere that doesn't involve close contact with the most at risk portion of the population.
500,April 8th and December 17th.
501,Odds are in favor of reinfection.
502,"Additionally, this individual was symptomatic both times."
503,"We can compare the political systems determining lockdown restrictions, though."
504,"Which is the primary concern of the article, yes?"
505,[deleted]
506,"No, that is not correct."
507,It should be *solely* about saving lives of US citizens.
508,"I, as a US citizen, am not willing to sacrifice my family so that someone who is in this country illegally can live."
509,The restrictions will likely last at least another month or two.
510,I assume you’re able to get approved so it’s a matter of securing a flight and going through the paperwork for quarantine schedule.
511,"Unfortunately, no where does it say how many died."
512,"The hospital claimed there was no oxygen shortage and only 4 died, so it was more than 4."
513,"Personal anecdote; 

I work near a restaurant that has people (including officers) eating inside every morning."
514,The day before Christmas Eve it was absolutely packed.
515,"As far as gyms, even when they were supposed to be closed, a few of them were ignoring orders."
516,I live in the Northern California area.
517,Even my own job is over booked.
518,"After we left the first lockdown in California, we never really went back on."
519,I see plenty of people out and about and have for months.
520,I even personally know people who never stopped mingling between households.
521,From what I see on social media of the LA area people never stopped partying in mass amounts.
522,"Not sure what more is going on there though, what other factors, ect."
523,"Anyway, we started off good but nothing has actually been enforced, no one gives a shit; it’s all smoke and mirrors."
524,"You can report things, but no one comes."

533,You c-a-n-n-o-t run from physical reality.
534,In the Atlantic bubble.
535,Vietnam is definitely on another level of testing and quarantine enforcement than we are.
536,But we're the tightest in North America and just about as tight as we can without a revolt from our right wing nut jobs.
537,Our restrictions are strict enough that we have prevented unrestricted community transmission which is a big deal sitting on the American powder keg.
538,Yeah 3 months ago.
539,Millions have gone back to normal
540,Wonder if this is the real reason my snowbird neighbours are heading out next week.

547,"Remember, there is close to 0 risk of death for someone healthy under the age of 65 barring some form of undiagnosed health issue."
548,It's not a steady line on a graph.
549," 

&gt;Ministry  of Industry and Information says there will be enough vaccine for mass  inoculations domestically, including 100 million doses ahead of Lunar  New Year."
550,"China has also agreed to provide vaccines to a large number of countries, but it remains unclear how exports will be handled."
551,"Hope it's a decent quality vaccine, like the western ones."
552,I moved to Florida from California in late September and it’s astonishing how differently they’re both handling this compared to the end results
553,"I know, it's a purely hypothetical based on a virus that was extremely hazardous to a younger age group."

596,Different countries may have different terminology to this also.
597,"As u/Scrub_Kincaid said, it’s a very bad situation where normal triage is swapped for combat/reverse triage."
598,"It means you don’t have enough resources to treat everyone, so you prioritise those you can save with treatment, over those who will likely die."

610,They are not prioritised by “the government” but their own health authorities
611,Stop the tier system and just begin a series of mass vaccinations nationwide.
612,"Seriously, it’s a much better idea than this tiered system where people who are even eligible for it don’t want to get it."
613,I say let’s just cut the bullshit and let everyone who wants the fucking vaccine able to get it as soon as possible.
614,You don't think the anti-mask movement has nothing to do with increased infection rates?
615,"Yeah, given that the USA is capitalist, it sounds like capitalist arrangements to me,

No idea why the commentor felt they had to throw communism in there,"
616,the vaccine manufacturers say you need to take 2 doses.
617,you really tryna go against whats recommended for a new vaccine?
618,no thanks ill follow the instructions writtencom the box.
619,I would say even deny airport access
620,I'm not a fucking news anchor on TV.
621,I'm on a daily discussion thread on reddit.
622,Your comments are absurd and you should learn that humans have emotions.
623,This is the real answer here.
624,Everything done to protect the general public has been half-assed.
625,Canada actually banked on I believe 3 different vaccines.
626,And even then the logistics to deploy a vaccine planet wide is certainly a daunting task.
627,corona is shy it wont get you in smaller rooms
628,Such a tragedy!
629,It's a shame the government tries to hide what happened there.
630,You can definitely make a good argument for why an EUA is better in this case.
631,"Calling it faffing about and shitting and whatever is not a good argument though, it just makes you sound like someone who doesn't know what he's talking about venting and ranting."
632,"They have ordered that many, not received them."
633,The issue is that Pfizer cannot manufacture quick enough for demand.
634,Mainly due to complexity in manufacture process compared to the Astrazeneca vaccine
635,"You didn't read the article, or didn't understand it - nowhere in the article does it say they did not apply for a visa."
636,"In the article it clearly states China knew this was happening, and agreed to it, and are refusing to issue visas 

follow the simple logic above that indicates this is at least suspicious - it's actually so basic and you're acting like you hold this key information that 'they didn't even apply' ffs..."

638,"They currently have the worst outbreak in the country, as I’ve read from CovidActNow’s metrics of cases per 100k."
639,Lol even they had cases didn’t they?
640,The majority of states in Australia has seen no or very little community transmission of COVID since May
641,What?
642,Regulate travel?
643,With what authority?
644,"&gt;Article I, Section 8, Clause 3 of the US Constitution

&gt; [The Congress shall have Power] To regulate Commerce with foreign Nations, and among the several States, and with the Indian Tribes;"
645,Might have something to do with the African strain.
646,How do you implement it though?
647,"Spain does it that it needs to be within 72 hours of the test time, that's very hard to fulfill as many places won't give you results in that time frame (i.e."
648,you'd have to time it perfectly).
649,So in practice you're essentially closing the borders in most circumstances.
650,"With Brexit changes on top, that might not be the best plan right now."
651,"I’m a Brit living in Singapore, was gutted not to go home and see family (haven’t been able to leave the island all year) but so happy I’m not living in that shit show."
652,"We have been in one form or another of lockdown all year so, whilst we had a hiccup at the start with the worker dorms everything is almost back to normal."
653,As someone else mentioned the willingness of the local population to follow the rules is what’s made this achievable.
654,The fuck heads in the U.K. having big parties or just not wearing masks/seeing people they shouldn’t have ruined it for the whole country.
655,"It’s been spreading, let’s be real."
656,Nobody should be surprised that this variant which is faster spreading is here in the US.
657,I guarantee you that hundreds of thousands of people already have it at this moment in America.

So people will die in the holding area in stead of in the ambulance."
663,"This doesn't *really* solve the problem, only moves it from one place to the other."
664," 

The findings prompted an urgent reminder from the researchers: Getting a flu shot will not only protect you against infection but may also reduce your risk for these serious complications."
665,Researchers in the first study found that flu can increase your odds for having a stroke by almost 40 percent -- and that added risk remains for a full year.
666,I prefer something with a little bit more noise.
667,the research station on Antarctica shouldn’t really count.
668,lol.
669,"seriously, there is always going to be outliers in any pandemic, given enough time even they can win the covid lottery."
670,"To be fair, GDP figures so far are only slightly better than the rest of the West."
671,Fully agree.
672,This sub is rock hard for permanent lockdowns and isolation though so prepare to be downvoted.
673,The damage caused by lockdowns is unfairly put on the lowest risk people - and we have collectively as a society decided we’re ok with destroying their education and socialization skills at a critical time in kids lives.
674,“But you want to kill grandma” “education is worthless if they’re dead!
675,!1” - fuck off.
676,Cases will never be zero.
677,Life is not zero risk.
678,We cannot keep destroying peoples lives and businesses forever
679,At least he isn't an idiot supporting brain drain from poorer countries in order to compensate failures to prepare by richer countries.
680,Then those conditional market approvals should have been made less stringent in the middle of an _emergency_.
681,"You can't hide behind ""bureaucracy"" and ""how the process works"" when all of the EU is disastrously behind at vaccination and under fire from all sides for it."
682,Be better and be faster.
683,I'm seriously shocked at how little some people expect from their governments and institutions.
684,"I've said this before, these delays (worldwide, EU is just an especially bad offender) are shitting all over the incredible work the scientists have done."
685,[deleted]
686,"Pretty self evident that you are the only idiot commenting, I guess the upside of self isolation and social distancing is you can childishly insult strangers without having to worry about getting punched in the teeth lol"
687,Hopefully we can agree this is within Rule 8.
688,I think it’s helpful to share information on viral infections and their health impacts beyond acute symptoms.
689,Hoping this boosts our understanding that there are already studies suggesting virus can raise the risk for severe and long-term conditions.
690,That poor man has to look at his money after all...
691,The virus is free...
692,There's probably individual nurses who have vaccinated more people than France.
693," 

&gt;A 39-year old care home worker from Brabant has become the first person in the Netherlands to be vaccinated against coronavirus."
694,"Sanna Elkadiri was given the vaccination at the mass vaccination centre in Veghel   


Good luck, Netherlands."
695,But you could speed up the process.
696,Does anyone realize how utterly insane that is?
697,"Population density (LA county alone has 10 million people, the entire metro area is more), multigenerational households (3-4 generations) crammed into 1970s style ranches because housing is expensive, people who don’t care about guidelines and police not reinforcing said guidelines, and a mistaken belief that just being with family is okay/safe."
698,Oh and CA has fewer ICU beds per capita than many states.
699,"So more people in a household getting sick and more sick people due to sheer population density is a bad, bad time there."
700,China confirmed human to human before they locked down wuhan.
701,It was waiting for the evidence that took the longest time.
702,Once again colonial hangover
703,And that's the way you do it.
704,"With like 60 people, right?"
705,So proud
706,"That is the same information, when I wrote it an article had said 444% I can’t find that one, it was probable taken down or changed."
707,It also wasn’t a scientific study but community statistics analysis on cases.
708,Didn’t realize my comment would blow up.
709,The emergency use allowance practices in US and UK are not as stringent as the EU conditional market approvals practices.
710,"I understand it's frustrating, but you really need to know at least a tiny bit about how the process works to make a real criticism."
711,I don't really get why the government doesn't take control of the hospitals.
712,Right now they have a serious problem there.
713,"One hospital is crowded, another is not...

You clearly need to use the whole healthcare system as 1 organism right now, like it's done in Europe, without taking into account who owns hospitals or insurances."
714,A unified system to save more lifes.
715,Also sending people to other regions and states is really needed right now without taking into account insurances or hospitals ownership.
716,"Either by ambulance, or planes."
717,Medicalized hotels for non icu patients and transformation on ICU the rest of beds on the hospital if possible.
718,"That's a lot of money, so the government better prepare a huge budget to save people."
719,"Also making masks mandatory everytime outside home, enforcing hard lockdowns, making hand washing mandatory at the entrance and exit of every businesses, and a lot of police to enforce the lockdown appropriately."
720,"Maybe paying people 80% of the salary for those who can't work, like in Europe, would also help to enforce the lockdown."
721,Scientists in political offices?
722,Impossible!
723,Don’t know why your downvoted your not implying anything at all.
724,It seems atleast that Latinos tend to live with more family members then others.
725,A normal house hold could be like mom dad 3 kids and grandma and grandpa.
726,Apocalyptic images.
727,Right
728,"Stock market will oddly continue to climb as long as stimulus money goes out due to inflation... which will actually make the stimulus receivers more poor in the long run, unfortunately."
729,And it will then continue to rise once everything gets wide open again.
730,"There will always be more crashes, but the combination of unprecedented money printing and rapid recovery is actually a perfect recipe for rocketing markets."
731,"Source: no idea, just some shit I've read or maybe my buddy told me, can't remember"
732,"Dead people don't pay taxes, of course the government care."
733,Imagine using the word communist in an argument without irony.
734,You don't get paid to isolate?
735,"Even in the US if I'm contact traced as a close contact of a coworker, I would be paid to stay home and isolate."
736,And I live a lifestyle where I have literally zero close contacts outside of work.
737,"I have been having groceries delivered in large quantities once a month, no actual contact with a human."
738,Of course China won’t let anyone in!
739,Why is anyone surprised and if they were allowed in they’d probably never been seen again.
740,This is a country hungry for world domination because they are nuts!
741,We should not take our eye off the ball because we are preoccupied with Covid.
742,Blatantly not true.
743,Mixing the jabs will only be done in national emergencies when supply is too low.
744,A reasonable percentage of the vaccinated have also received their second vaccine.
745,Keep pushing the agenda though
746,&gt; deaths should plummet.
747,That depends on the spread of the virus.
748,"If twice as many people catch the virus, but care home residents are not among them, that still means ICU usage and deaths rise."
749,"Believe it or not, I have heard people say that because the mask is leaky, it could end up ""trapping more virus"", thus concentrating it closer to your nose and mouth, and that's why you shouldn't wear masks."
750,"Yeah, I'm sure all the healthcare workers who are wearing them are trying to get sick."
751,smdh.
752,We needed to sacrifice some freedom for extensive contact tracing.
753,We should have learned from the countries who have had success like South Korea.
754,But this country hasn't dealt with anything like this in living memory and didn't have the will for it.
755,OK that's fair enough then.
756,I can see why they would this with the Pfizer vaccine.
757,Thx for the link.
758,"&gt; The man who tested positive has not traveled abroad and is currently  isolating at home, DPH said in a statement."
759,Contract tracing is being  done and those who have been in close contact with the man will be  tested for the variant as well.
760,So it's already spreading in the communities.
761,is the second dose exactly the same as de frist?
762,Didnt Canadá had like 300% of its population in vaccines?
763,Free enterprise
764,Israel wants the territories but not the people.
765,Down 2.2% for the year to September.
766,Mostly due to international tourism being shut down.
767,Linda easy to do with 5 million people and an island
768,I really hate that this is happening
769,Too bad we cannot just divide up the land.
770,"Those who want to live in one side and those who don't, on the other"
771,"&gt; It seems to me that the best defense against this is to get the vaccines out as quickly as possible,

That will be too late."
772,"With the current exponential growth we see in the UK, the only solution is a hard lockdown."
773,"The best info that I have seen on it:
https://twitter.com/jbloom_lab/status/1346442000472580098"
774,Xenophobic how?
775,All the ex pats I know were able to get back in under our level 2/3/4 lockdown.
776,We would prefer you didn't come here for a holiday and spread the virus into our country thanks very much
777,"Ah yeah, more irrelevant nitpicking defusing from the real subject of the article."
778,Serbia is together with Montenegro in the last stage of the negotiations to join the EU.
779,"It also doesn't expect vaccines from the EU, having already purchased a small number of doses from both Pfizer and the evil ruskies paying from their own pocket."
780,"It is, to me the right thing to do, that the European countries that arent in the EU start solving their problems and their fiercely EU loyal politicians stop talking of the glorious day in the future where EU accession will solve things for them."
781,"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accession_of_Serbia_to_the_European_Union

North Macedonia went through the humiliating step of changing their name and national identity in order to start an EU accession process only for new hurdles to be thrown on their way."
782,"The Albanian accession process was also delayed way beyond what is reasonable and it would theoretically take an entire generation for those two countries to join, assuming that will ever happen."
783,"Nobody, neither here, nor in the article, wrote of former yoguslavian countries with emphasis on a supposed extreme poverty."
784,Bit our of the topic but some corrections that had to be made
785,"Oh man, definitely don't try to tell this to republicans."
786,🤯
787,"It's so easy to say that now,  but hindsight is 20 20"
788,Does the vaccine also protect against the new strain?
789,I think you should be careful of some crab mentality going on here.
790,Both teachers and nonessential retail should be closed right now.
791,There's nothing particularly special about either group.
792,"Your argument basically boils down to ""why should this group of people get 'x' when I don't get 'x'""."
793,"A better response for you to look at is to try to advocate for nonessential retail like yourself to have better working conditions, not to take away better working conditions from another group."
794,You have to control your borders.
795,If you don't then your response can't be much better than the worst performing nation.
796,Saying it can't be done is wrong.
797,"New South Wales, Australia has more land border than any European country yet all other states controlled their borders when the borders were shut."
798,Even though the vast majority of intrastate trade is done by road in Australia.
799,"Not being able to close the border is a failure of the EU, not something that can't be done."
800,You see these kind of people every so often but everyone else is pretty quick to sort them out.
801,A weird one going around among the tinfoil hat people recently was that the government is building 5G towers to spy on your brainwaves!
802,😬
803,"Had COVID in October and it was literally like a cold, no serious symptoms and I also have Asthma."
804,The only thing that made me go get tested was the loss of smell.
805,It's really weird cause I never had that before.
806,Nice.
807,Just keep those freezers failing.
808,Several other European countries have an even higher death rate per capita.
809,The UK strain will show its true power in a few weeks though.
810,Expect 2-3k deaths/day on a 7-day rolling average.
811,!RemindMe 4 weeks
812,"Oh yes, I dabbled in the beers and my husband went higher up the shelf!"
813,I’m fine with health care first.
814,Particularly those who are actually treating covid patients.
815,The problem is then having 60 different groups after that.
816,Frontline healthcare then just do it by age is what needs to happen.
817,"Plot twist, France never existed, it's all been a joke run by the English since 1066."
818,Trump can't do anything about that and neither can Biden.
819,"The president of the United States doesn't have the reach  to micromanage how every single hospital, clinic, and pharmacy in the country distributes the vaccine"
820,&gt;You do understand the IFR for kids in COVID is literally lower than the flu right?
821,"Yep

&gt; Also, grade schools are not drivers, they merely correlate with community spread 

Then why do teachers have 333% prevalence rates?"
822,LOL
823,"Vindictive and gutter dwelling comment:  you want someone to get sick, and you call them a douche because you are obsessed with their facebook page ."
824,"You are making things worse, not better with this hateful and closed-minded approach to life."
825,"That’s my point, there isn’t any research to show long term side effects because the vaccine hasn’t been around long enough."
826,Still have to wear a mask after receiving the vaccine.
827,"I want to thank NZ, we in Australia would have never got our collective shit together had it not been for you folks showing us the way first 🙏"
828,"Yes we unfortunately had to have a funeral in the middle of one of our lockdowns (not covid related), and had to tell so many family and friends that they couldn't attend."
829,"Everybody here in NZ is pretty unified though, we respected the rules of the lockdown, even if we weren't always happy about it."
830,"We're taking the rewards now though,  life is normal for us."
831,"Seriously, we wish you guys in the US well though, we hope you turn a corner soon."
832,Do you have a link to this law?
833,"Also something something Rigged Election storm the White House, or white building whatever it is"
834,"Good catch, didn’t notice that"
835,Think of all the lives that could be saved by enacting lockdowns at all times!
836,"What a safe, new world we would have."
837,"Because your proposal for firing 2,000 people, some with specialized credentials, would create a WAY bigger problem than the current one with distance learning."
838,So I was curious if you knew what you were talking about.
839,The problem was that European countries didn't use the time in lockdown to prepare for not being in lockdown.
840,Getting to low numbers makes it controllable but then going back to normal means it's going to come back.
841,You need to control your borders and implement effective contact tracing once you come out of lockdown.
842,That’s 1/17 infected *right now at this moment*.
843,"New York’s 20% in the worst areas was total infections over something like 2 or 3 months...

With just an R0 of 1 and a lag time of 7 days that puts them at the vast majority of the population infected in the same time that NY took to get that 20%."
844,"Don’t forget that even a lockdown doesn’t stop this instantly like in NY and Wuhan, people newly infected today will be bringing it home and spreading it to their families still getting *at least* 1-2 more rounds of exponential growth if extremely stringent measures were already taken today."
845,"just happened in méxico too, but the authorities are investigating the person who released the news, not the responsables for the failure"
846,What happens if you vaccinated someone who currently had Covid?
847,"The pandemic also had a terrible effect on mental health, and forced people to spend even more time in online echo chambers where extremist thinking was completely out of control."
848,"That’s odd, I haven’t been seeing many articles posted here about other cities’ healthcare systems completely collapsing, it’s mainly been about LA :/"

854,I currently have COVID.
855,I started with minor congestion and it was only when I realized I couldn’t smell that I got tested.
856,Day 8 and fortunately symptoms have stayed mild.
857,Silver lining is not having to smell my dogs poop when I pick it up.
858,France is a lie?
859,Vietnam is bloody amazing.
860,Once you get over the culture shock and the general chaos it feels like coming home.

885,The NY number was having had COVID at some point.
886,This number is for currently having COVID.
887,I'm still struggling to put all this together.
888,The why and how of who gets slammed by this virus is extremely complicated.
889,"A lot of the places that experienced a major surge last spring (NY, MA, CT, NJ, etc...) are doing comparatively well, despite more lax restrictions than CA through winter."
890,"However, you could explain this with better behavior/attitudes."
891,"Nowhere experienced nearly as large a surge in the summer, but the places that experienced a medium surge this summer (FL, TX, etc...) are rising now, but much slower than CA."
892,"The places that experienced a major surge in the Fall (ND, SD, IL, etc...) are quickly dropping in cases, again, despite less strict restrictions than CA."
893,It makes me wonder how much immunity is playing a role.
894,Obviously we're not at herd immunity anywhere.
895,"We might be at ""restriction-adjusted"" herd immunity in places that have been hit hard though, such that it takes significantly less restriction to keep the pandemic under control in places like NY, MA, NJ (and now SD, ND, IL, MI, LA, etc...) and slightly less restriction in places like FL, TX, AZ, etc... and tons of restriction in CA."
896,I'm not saying we're at herd immunity at all.
897,"If we open up completely, obviously we'll have major surges."
898,"However, you can almost predict the course of the pandemic this winter depending on a particular region's history in the pandemic."
899,"Major surge in the spring: Small surge in winter (NJ, NY, MA, CT, etc...)

Medium surge in summer: Surge in winter, but slower accelerating than CA (FL, TX, etc...) 

Major surge in Fall: Hospitalizations falling (ND, SD, IL, etc...)

CA is the one place that has, up until now, avoided a major surge."
900,"It doesn't feel like a coincidence that when the levees finally broke in the winter, it wound up being particularly intense."
901,It seems like the only way to deal with a virus like this is early and *intense* intervention.
902,Either eliminate it or you're essentially bound to have a surge eventually.
903,"As more people lose their will to social distance, I imagine we'll have more of these catastrophic events waiting, especially in areas that have largely avoided the virus so far."
904,The vaccines can't come quick enough.
905,"Yes, and culturally has a mandate to survive."
906,[removed]
907,Nut.
908,"Or, until you encounter the South African variant."
909,"I think he's updating his prediction regularly to track the daily averages (to be clear, that's a good thing - just pointing our that his previous predictions had us doing more per day than now)"
910,No.
911,We've started yesterday.
912,This is not a surprise at all.
913,money can buy many things.
914,Measly vaccine is not a big deal considering Pfizer said they are still sitting on vaccine supply and no state is close to exhausting its supply.
915,"While this is not ideal, this is not a big deal."
916,Doing health care first was a mistake.
917,They already have the protected gear.
918,The inflow into hospitals it what needs to be stopped and that's mostly 60+ and why israel is smartly doing them first.
919,"&gt;  a COVID-19 evangelist 

""I'm not a super spreader."
920,"I'm a covid evangelist"""
921,Semi-correct:  its does mean more deaths.
922,"Not more deadly (this particular variant) to an individual yes, but more deadly to society as a whole, as more people have it,so more people die from it."
923,Deaths in the UK are already up 30% over just a week ago.
924,"And this doesn't account for ""secondary deaths"" from other medical issues due to overloaded hospitals etc."
925,I mean 1/17 (a number which is extrapolated on the assumption that the city is under reporting) is still only 6% of the population infected.
926,"94% are still viable to get infected, unlike New York where it was estimated 20+% was infected."
927,Duh
928,Who is also doing really well (five cases nationwide yesterday).
929,Exactly!
930,For instance: *we don't have hobbits.

963,Even with family members.
964,I’m done.
965,It’s just me and my kids.
966,Fuck the rest.
967,I’m done.
968,The Australian state of New South Wales is a better model.
969,The same initial hard lockdown to get the initial outbreak under control and then opening back up with contract tracing to control any outbreaks.
970,NSW opened up in June with 10 ish new cases a day; Completely eliminated community spread of the virus; Got reinfected in July after the Victorian response fell apart; Eliminated community spread again by November without going back into lockdown.
971,NSW is currently dealing with a new outbreak due to a hotel quarantine leak and has it back to single digit infections per day.
972,NSW's response kept the economy going and people have been able to live their lives mostly as they would have.
973,NZ's response is effective but repeatedly locking down will destroy business confidence in the long term.
974,Not at all.
975,They just used the shortest reasonable time period so they could complete the trials as quickly as possible.

977,I agree 100%.

981,"Israel isn’t sending vaccines to Jordan, Egypt, or Iran either."
982,Well darn that sucks huh
983,Well we are really talking about healthcare workers and elderly.
984,NY probably has more healthcare workers than total number of people living in ND.
985,So my point still stands.
986,Its easier to vaccinate less people.
987,BTW those hospitals in ND aren't going to be distributed all over the state either.

992,"We're making no progress, so let's do this ok?"
993,"We will both sit back for a month and see what the verdict is on your (and Fauci's) support for sticking to ""the science"" (supposed science) on the 28 day inter dose delay."
994,I'm predicting that Fauci's (and your) position on that will be widely discredited.
995,"If not then please feel free to get back with a ""I told you so""."
996,I won't think any the worse of you.
997,But I will think worse of you if you keep attempting to win this argument by posting walls of text with nothing new in them.

1013,I have type 2 diabetes will that qualify me to get it sooner?
1014,Not only that a year ago i was in the hospital due to double pneumonia and respiratory distress syndrome for 3 weeks and in a medically induced coma 4 of those days.
1015,Im fully healed from it.
1016,This was a month before the Corona virus started.
1017,Will this qualify me to get the vaccine sooner?
1018,"Also i work for a dog kennel,  are we considered other essential workers?"
1019,I deal with clients who travel in the country and outside the county when they drop off and pick up their pets.

1025,"Luckily I’m still able to do the duties of my job without too much trouble, especially since I asked them to jab my non-dominant arm."
1026,"Other side effects I’m experiencing are fatigue and a mild headache, but neither of those have gotten any worse in the past 4-5 hours or so."
1027,Pretty much going as expected so far!
1028,Why do you think we'd need everyone to get the vaccine to stop the pandemic?
1029,Do you believe US leaving Iraq was good?
1030,Didn’t Europe just sign a new trade deal with China?

1039,I think things will be 85 to 90% normal by summer.
1040,Between a good portion of the population getting vaccinated and seasonal drops and infections I think will start seeing very low amounts of deaths and hospitalizations.
1041,Pro Life folk are weird.
1042,"I agree, this is silly."
1043,What was phase 3 even for if governments are going to do their own thing?
1044,"If we're just going to start experimenting with doses and scheduling, without worrying about affecting effectiveness, then we should have just started taking vaccine candidates last summer as soon as they were proven to be safe and generate antibodies."
1045,"We waited months to see the effectiveness of a very specific regiment, and now we throw it out the window?"
1046,"Never complain about money going to basic research, our ignorance is the beginning knowledge."
1047,You already see this somewhat in people’s word choice.

1049,"I think there’s a very big difference in what each statement implies, and the latter statement could be used in many more situations than the former."
1050,i'm confused - do you mean people had teeth problems because of diet?
1051,"i'm talking about how they can grow in at weird angles, be impacted, be too close together, have one way higher than the other teeth, etc."
1052,"basically lots of stuff that can cause pain and make it harder to actually use your teeth, which there's no evolutionary advantage to having and isn't a result of that individual's lifestyle."
1053,modern dentistry can treat these kinds of issues but it also shows our teeth were not integral to our survival.
1054,You're opinion is wrong.
1055,Sometimes delaying is a strategy by the defense.

1062,"Arm felt like someone punched it for about a day, and woke up the day after getting the shot with mild fatigue."
1063,"I heard the second shot can make you show a little more symptoms like that, but I'll take it over getting covid since I'm higher risk."
1064,Good explanation.
1065,For regularly-scheduled shots they should have two lines: the people in the appropriate tier who have appointments and a bunch if people on standby.

1144,I imagine the main problem is most of the 1.3M vaccinated wont get full immunization in almost a month (3 weeks Pfizer and I think 4 weeks AZ) so 6 weeks doesn't seem all that irrational once you account the small number of people getting vaccinated and also the small number of people that are actually getting immunization.

1251,They say children are less likely to spread and catch coronavirus but are they talking about high school students?
1252,"&gt; However, the next highest prevalence has been observed in secondary school children (11–18 years old), suggesting that they are likely to be an important source of infection to peers and others rather than a sink."
1253,Also the studies have found despite having measures to prevent coronavirus spread; it was spreading in 30% of instances where cases were identified.
1254,"&gt;The authors did, however, find some evidence of within-school transmission in 55 (31%) of 177 instances where cases were identified."
1255,"This was in the context of small class or bubble sizes, half empty schools, and extensive hygiene measures."
1256,You state that I run off intuition and I am aware of my biases as someone who works with students and your argument is a valid one.
1257,"However, bringing my argument together, the science itself states that reaching such a conclusion that children do not spread coronavirus as rapidly and thus reopen the schools is a flawed idea."
1258,"&gt;Although the study makes a clear case for the need to improve infection control for staff in schools, one might be tempted to infer from the comparatively small proportion of reported infections in children that within-school transmission among children plays a negligible role in the COVID-19 pandemic."

1303,Yes
1304,One of the things the MHRA do differently to the EMA which has allowed them to speed up approval is batch testing.
1305,The EMA require detailed information about how the vaccine is produced and the standards to ensure that the vaccine is produced to a high quality ect.
1306,and also requires a thorough inspection of the facilities.
1307,As far as I'm aware this information hasn't been provided by Astrazeneca.
1308,The MHRA (british) get around this by testing each batch themselves to satisfy themselves of the quality and releasing batches one by one.
1309,Perhaps this is something the EMA are looking into to get around this stumbling block.
1310,If however it's the raw data they are not happy with then there isn't much they can do until more data comes out.
1311,Whether that's later updates on the UK and Brazilian trials or the US trial remains to be seen.

1477,Shots need to get in arms.
1478,How do rich people cutting the line make deployment faster for the purple that need is?
1479,A higher household income in the US doesn't mean more money for working families that have no paid leave and no access to affordable childcare.

1550,Hospital here has more doses than they need.
1551,And they have healthcare workers refusing to take it.
1552,Every vial has a few extra doses that must be used in a timely fashion.
1553,If no one is there to get it it will end up wasted.
1554,So if some rich guy wants to drop some money into the hospitals account to get that vaccine so it’s not wasted I see no problems.

1570,It’s definitely widespread but the rate at which places are finding the new strain(like 8 total in the entire country) suggest it is not what is driving this surge in cases.
1571,Even though the US sequences just 0.5% of cases that would be more than enough to see that the new strain is what is the cause of the surge.
1572,I think it’s just easier to blame the new boogeyman rather than their own behavior.

1584, You think we were in Wuhan with microscopes tracking this pandemic last year?
1585,I listen to science...I'm pretty good at tracking it across different media stories.
1586,This pandemic isn't the first time I've had to do this.
1587,"~~Here’s one of many:

Oops, here is the one I meant to link:

1588,I agree.
1589,The Federal response sucked
1590,"I mean... that’s pretty typical of LA, pandemic or not"
1591,"It’s not just California, but the problem around the country is plans to prioritize higher risk groups look good on paper but are failing in reality."
1592,[removed]
1593,"Well, if you feel it isn't fair, argue your case before Judge Covid."
1594,I'm sure they'll reconsider.
1595,In that case you should be able to link the research very easily.
1596,I'd love to see it.
1597,Its sad but I'm pretty sure this is already known.
1598,Meat workers and amazon packing staff had to work around confirmed people
1599,"&gt; This virus is NOT a political opportunity to crush your opponenents and spread fake unscientific news

Tell that to the democrats."
1600,And it goes both ways.
1601,Yesterday someone got quite a few upvotes saying mRNA vaccines have been in use for years.
1602,"Um, what?"
1603,Fuck the GOP and the horse they rode in on.
1604,"The best analogy I can think of is that it's like a drunk driver who's managed to cause an accident where others are killed, but not themselves though in this analogy they may be injured, and the drunk driver is trying to help out with the allocation/direction of the EMT's and their medical assistance."
1605,FUCK THAT.
1606,P.S.
1607,Fully expect my comment to get deleted because it's 'political' or for my use of their *fricken' actual title* of 'GOP'.
1608,Not American exceptionalism.
1609,I'd say the same for a degree from Oxford or Cambridge.
1610,Elite universities have global recognition.
1611,"An Oxford degree has value in the US, a Harvard degree has value in England or Sweden."
1612,What makes NZ so unique that all college degrees are exactly the same?
1613,Source?
1614,There is only one true source of data which is the article I linked.
1615,All other “sources” merely sliced and diced the number from that trial to suit whatever they wanted.
1616,Who would even want to be a teacher right now?
1617,"Doesn't matter if your healthcare is private or state, expensive or free, if the hospitals are full of Covid patients (and doctors and nurses are ill) you're in trouble."
1618,Yet some people just don't see this.
1619,"There are a ton of costs that this could fall in the ""stitch in time saves nine"", not just replacement of human capital."
1620,"A restaurant tends to be on pretty tight margins, if people don't feel safe going out, even a small percentage of them, then the business will not be able to sustain itself."
1621,"a little bit of cash that keeps that business going from the government is soon gone but if that percentage of people comes back, the business goes under and the government has spent that money with little to no benefit."
1622,"Many folks are reliant on government medical services, especially those in the most danger major complications, so each person that goes into the hospital for weeks, is many thousands of dollars(many) in bills and resources that the government will have to pay for... which will cost a hell of a lot more than just having people at home."
1623,"and yes, even ill workforce that shuts down a place for a month or more on a rolling basis will cause massive problems."
1624,It’s strange.
1625,"Whenever restrictions are loosened, cases go up."
1626,What’s going on?
1627,?
1628,"So, who should people listen to and follow?"
1629,Just over 24 hours after my first Moderna shot and the only side effect remaining is a sore arm.
1630,"I had a headache, chills, and fatigue yesterday, although the headache did subside just before bed."
1631,Feeling just fine today though.
1632,"Every step of the way during this pandemic, happy talk bullshitters have been 100% off base."
1633,Fully agree.
1634,We all have to do our part.
1635,The government needs to “guide” us because apparently people can’t figure out on their own that touching people with dirty hands or sharing spit with each other during a pandemic is not a good idea.
1636,People want no sacrifices and a magical fix from “the government”
1637,Sure I agree.
1638,if that had been the type of approach from the top it wouldn't have just been messaging they're probably would have been associated action as well.
1639,But end of the day the truth is we'll never know 🤷‍♂️
1640,You have to read the whole article...not cherry pick.
1641,It's human immunity too.
1642,Not just the meds.
1643,"""Gottlieb cited experimental evidence from Bloom Lab, and explained 501.V2  does appear to partially escape prior immunity."
1644,"It means that some of the antibodies people produce when they get infected with Covid, as well as the antibody drugs, may not be quite as effective."""
1645,because the federal government has the money printer thaat they can make go BRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRR
1646,"Hey there,

Due to reliability issues with your source, we don't allow rt.com as a source."
1647,Rule 5 has more information about reliability.
1648,Nope.
1649,And she caused a pandemic because she didn't beat Trump and so the left had to call China to get them to release a virus and then get all the other nations in on this hoax so that Sleepy J could get elected so that way Nancy Pelosi could deem him medically unfit so that way Kamala Harris(who didn't even grow up in America!)
1650,could become president.
1651,I said that the government sucks.
1652,I agree with you.
1653,This should have been handled better.
1654,Now we're going to see civil litigation pick up the pieces in the dust for years to come.
1655,In NY it happened so quickly that nobody even knew what care to ration.
1656,The death rate was so high.
1657,Now we know so much more about how to treat the issues and improve outcomes.
1658,And the overwhelmed areas in NY were kind of specific so there was a buffer.
1659,NY was on complete lockdown so there was nothing to be confused about and quiet regions stayed quiet.
1660,I think there was even medical help from other unaffected states but now basically all states are drowning.
1661,Being re-educated.
1662,It makes me wonder how much time and money we’d save if westerners started wearing masks when they felt sick...
1663,You couldn’t be more wrong.
1664,Plenty of diseases are most infective in the days leading up to symptom development.
1665,Welcome to reddit where 50% of the users are american and therefore everything will be brought back in comparison to that.
1666,like it or leave it i guess
1667,Why?
1668,You can’t even answer
1669,"While we don't know for sure, it's unlikely that vaccinated people can transmit the virus, so there wouldn't be much of a point to wearing a mask."
1670,*But* it also seems unlikely that stores are going to ask their front door employees to check individual people's vaccination cards so we're probably going to have blanket rules asking everyone to wear masks for the foreseeable future because otherwise everyone will just claim to have been vaccinated whether they actually have been or not.
1671,"Funny, reading your first comment I thought ""This sure sounds like the district my fiance was teaching in last year."""
1672,"Sure enough, exurbs of Houston."
1673,yeehaw.
1674,"What's worse is that this district gives the distance learners some self-guided material, no actual district teachers."
1675,"While I'm sure this lessons the workload on the actual teachers, the students are essential being deterred from taking healthy precautions by the risk of falling behind."
1676,"In this model the vaccine is being distributed based on personal wealth, not risk or contribution to society."
1677,"Do you believe wealth is an accurate measure of a person's potential contribution and if so, why would anyone bother becoming a nurse or first responder?"
1678,Throwing money at a bloated and unsustainable business model isn't charity and sidestepping rules created to ensure first responders are protected isn't noble.
1679,If they have open appointments they should be expanding the people eligible to receive it.

1693,Ah thank you.
1694,"Experts believe that vaccinated people will not express protective IgA in their mucous membranes, allowing the virus to replicate and shed from mucous membranes."

1761,No country outside of the us means shit to most Americans
1762,E484 has already been demonstrated to be neutralized by polyclonal antibodies.
1763,Where did you get the idea that they aren’t following cdc protocols in US schools?
1764,Very few states aren’t mandating masks at least.
1765,U.K. had no masking under 12 and no hybrid.
1766,You can read their protocols online.
1767,Teachers weren’t even required to wear them.

1771,"I don't blame you, it's hard not to be self destructible here."
1772,"In a sense, he's right."
1773,The last thing we need to do with kids are to lock them down and force them to have nothing but the internet as a means of public expression.
1774,On the other hand they already interact online without the pandemic.
1775,"What tips the balance here, is that kids with social, physiological and even learning disabilities aren't benefiting without having the structures that public schooling provides."
1776,"We don't know what makes some kids more susceptible to actions in which id call domestic terrorism others would label socially inadequate, awkward or insane."
1777,"As for the teachers, the state takes legal liability."
1778,I believe teachers should continue to not show until there's a true table meeting in which the school is sitting on one side along with the teachers while on the other side sits state attorney generals and state reps.
1779,The problem can't be solved negotiating at the bottom.
1780,"Since we can't talk politics, a president who had the decency in their term to try and fix the education problem implemented a sticker system that rewarded schools with higher testing."
1781,"The schools with the highest test scores in all states are mostly small, suburban middle class school districts."
1782,The schools that need the most resources are the bigger public schools that don't do well in testing.
1783,"While the failed reform that was put in place way back when was not the reasoning beyond the lack of resources for teachers, it didn't help."
1784,The issue is political.
1785,"For these teachers now to have to risk their life over a political decision, they shouldn't be forced to do this."
1786,"States should allow schools to decide how they want to handle the pandemic, while students and teachers should be able to do the same and if it leads to a strike and CBA, then so be it."
1787,If the district does have the decision they should just give in.

1794,Damnit Texas!
1795,I think the general idea is that the virus was created to better understand how to make vaccines against them.
1796,So it was to be used as a tool and the issue is that their protocols for keeping it in the lab were complete shit and so someone took it home with them.
1797,Just one of the theories floating around.

1888,I think people understand that a mask wont be 100% effective... Its seen as minor inconvenience that will increase the chance of stopping the spread of particles.
1889,I think the debate on masks was settled after SARS so this time around the debate is more on how quarantines will work and the economic impact of closing the country off from foreigners for extended periods of time...not on masks/washing hands and their efficacy.

These are scientific journals, so it doesn’t look as sensational as some MSM sources, but those numbers are abysmal."
1911,333% higher infection rate amongst educators.
1912,"The kids aren’t tested because they’re asymptotic, but it’s getting spread around somehow, right?"
1913,"I’m sorry to be the bad guy, but unless/until she tests positive there is literally no reason to tell anyone anything."
1914,"Virus, or  fragments, pcr can detect fragments of non viable virus, can it not?"
1915,"I’ve seen that theorized here, but it seems pretty far fetched to me."
1916,"Bacteria can develop strains resistant to antibiotics, but viruses are unlikely to be able to quickly mutate to evade what would otherwise be a successful immune response."
1917,"I’m not an expert in viruses though, and would accept evidence contradicting me here"
1918,And still... to this day... my 6th grade English teacher still follows me around.
1919,"Yes, sorry Ms. Fitzpatrick."
1920,I will remember this.
1921,Same here.
1922,Will definitely pop champagne lol
1923,I didn't say without consent.
1924,Plenty of people will be willing to do this.
1925,"Also plenty of people will not even bother with the second dose, so the data will be there to collect anyway if we're willing to actually study this rather than sit on our hands while more people go unvaccinated."
1926,But hanging out in doorways would be more dangerous in the Spring and Fall.

1929,[deleted]
1930,That means any health facility will now be a health hazard.
1931,I also commented on here questioning about the motive.
1932,Mostly because this is the second covid vaccine tampering article I have read.
1933,First was a pharmacist.
1934,And that's a whole career and lifestyle to just throw away.
1935,"Whatever their motive is, it sure isn't money."
1936,I think these people need to be heard on explaining their actions.
1937,But that will probably never make it to public ears.
1938,People have a right to live to.
1939,"The constitution isn't a biblical text, it's been amended, amended and amended again etc."
1940,Nothing is closed and people have no money.
1941,Blaming the people is pointless.
1942,The most egregious violations of lockdown aka the huge parties were never shut down.
1943,None of the restrictions are enforced.
1944,"What they mean is that, in general, viruses that kill their host do not spread as well."
1945,"Not just because dead people rarely go to parties, but it also means others are more likely to be careful around the disease."
1946,"The most efficient virus is one that has no negative impact at all, encouraging the host to continue social interactions that something like lethargy or other illness would prevent."
1947,"Of course, that doesn't mean it's impossible, but a strain that is more deadly is likely to face additional hurdles to spread compared to its less deadly counterpart."
1948,"Given enough time, evolutionary pressure is more likely to create a cold than an ebola."
1949,I had the same idea when I first heard about the vaccine.
1950,I was worried it was just being rushed through trials as fast as possible.
1951,"However....then I read that this vaccine has been in the works since the bird flu, which was years ago."
1952,"They took that, made it a higher priority, and now we have the vaccine today."
1953,That really helped alleviate all concerns that I have.
1954,I will be getting the vaccine as soon as I am allowed to.
1955,I really hope they prioritized others over me though since I am able to work from home just fine.
1956,"I wholeheartedly believe everyone else, and I mean everyone else, deserves it before me."
1957,Hes worse.
1958,Says the ass hair
1959,Hahaha brilliant !
1960,I thought they were urging Americans to go to Malaysia at first.
1961,"Covid is rampant in the US, whY would they suggest people come to the US?"
1962,To be fair this year has seen HUGE increases in criminal charges
1963,"I think he was joking that only 150m Americans will want to be vaccinated (hence 150 days), because there's so many anti-vaxxers."
1964,He already set a goal of 100 million in 100 days or something like that so surely there is a plan behind it.
1965,"WE'RE ALL FUCKED, THIS IS THE WAVE IS GOING TO MAKE PEOPLE EAT THEIR CHILDREN!!"
1966,!
1967,"&gt;He also doesn’t go that much into an important question: even if he’s right that gain-of-function experiments are too dangerous, that is a very different question from the one about whether viral samples should be collected at all."
1968,"He doesn’t offer many scientists saying they shouldn’t, while providing examples of lab leaks from the collections."
1969,"I feel like that's the authors main reasoning there, it's the low standards of the lab's personal security and attempted cover-up is to blame here not the specific experiments."
1970,Spoken as a full on rapist.
1971,[removed]
1972,The whole first part is the comment he deleted because he knew he was wrong.
1973,Its literally him showing he was wrong thats why he deleted it.
1974,"&amp;#x200B;

I didnt get myself."
1975,Nice.
1976,Love you Alex...
1977,A completely sealed suit with a self-contained air supply should be 100% effective.
1978,"""oh i will be fine, i wear a mask""

*gets into an accident on the way to the store."
1979,"has a chance to witness being pronounced dead at the scene while still alive and dying*

""oh that's what they meant when they said all ICU beds are full""

this was my big fear when our ICU was maxed out and my wife still insisted on going to all of her non-important appointments."
1980,so i think the limit is 'when they need it'
1981,Worker unavailability is a well known factor in a pandemic.
1982,"At U of Minnesota, multiple conferences discussed movement when H5N1 was then about to threaten the society."
1983,It's not just the passenger movers; it's the truckers who bring the goods to the retail stores who will be out in droves.
1984,"And then what, folks?"
1985,"It's still in the ""half a year"" ballpark to vaccinate most US people."
1986,I'm thankfully exempt from jury duty.
1987,The silver lining of having mental health issues\~
1988,"Ouch, I'm sorry to hear that."
1989,Do you know what started it?
1990,How do you survive financially?
1991,The problem is that we’re all in this together.
1992,"If we took that seriously life would be a lot better overall, and sooner."
1993,I’m sorry to hear you’re having such a hard time.
1994,It sounds really tough.
1995,This is where federalism as an American experiment clearly fails
1996,Wow several!
1997,Several.
1998,I wonder how many that is.
1999,More than a couple but probably less than a “lot”.
2000,"Since theres 50 states, and only _several_ are not following the cdc guidelines, that implies _most_ of them are!"
2001,Amazing how that works.
2002,"Thus, my point stands, we (as in most if us, since we cant just all move suddenly) get to wait for non compliant medical staff."
2003,"Yes a few states might do it differently, or more likely have no plan."
2004,"Just like a few rich people get to cut the line, theres exceptions to every rule and pointing that out really doesnt further the discussion in any meaningful way."
2005,Sorry bud.
2006,Not sure what the point of your comment was.
2007,"Good luck, comrade!"
2008,You mentioned doggy style??
2009,Reporting for duty sir!
2010,!
2011,"They wouldn't have to do the whole safety/efficacy testing again from start to finish, though."
2012,IIRC Pfizer said they could do it in ~6 weeks if need be.
2013,"If they sent you a notice to appear, and never rescinded it be really careful because they can issue a warrant for your arrest but never tell you and never come looking for you."
2014,It is only after you get pulled over for something minor that an officer finds out and gets you.
2015,It can be really ridiculous.
2016,Though I'm surprised if you sent in a reason like that of why you didn't want to go that they didn't rescind the notice to appear.
2017,"They may have just not sent it to you, because not all districts are all that great with that stuff."
2018,"&amp;nbsp;

For anyone else, there are hundreds of ways to get out of jury duty if you really want to."
2019,"But if you are financially able to and your health allows, just get it over with."
2020,"*btw interesting fact, if you live in a very rural area and you make the DA offices existence hell by forcing them to do their jobs, they often really don't want you on jury duty for future cases."
2021,"You’re not a bad guy, you’re an idiot."
2022,It’s not like a switch turns on and you’re positive.
2023,It’s not like you’re not positive until you get the test and then you’re positive once you get the results.
2024,Exactly.
2025,"nah, more like ICE concentration camps"
2026,"Nevertheless, if you cut Alaska in half, each of the new half-Alaskas would still be bigger than Texas :p They wouldn't beat you in the population size category, of course."
2027,Why does BC have so few flu deaths?
2028,"The U.S. appears to have far more, per capita."
2029,When does the ignorance stop???
2030,Ever?
2031,Taiwan tracks you by your phone location and credit card purchases and also enforces quarantine this way.
2032,That seems a bit on the totalitarian side to me.
2033,"If america adopts that process, well.. remember when we finally got rid of TSA after the plane hijacking threats went away?"
2034,it takes a few weeks for your body to build up its immunities after the shots.
2035,"so a few weeks after vaccination, you should be good."
2036,"BUT if you want to make sure others don't die, I'd probably wear a mask so those not yet vaccinated know they should, AND until most ppl are vaccinated, so anti-maskers anti-vaxers don't think it's okay to use a lie to not wear masks."
2037,"All those health care workers are overwhelmed, who can administer vaccines now?"
2038,The ignorance and denialism transcends stereotypes and age gaps.
2039,In all age groups some are good and some are not.
2040,I'm 25 and didn't get out much before because I have narcolepsy and live in a rural area and tend to restrict my driving and late night social activities heavily.
2041,I'm sure as hell not going to risk getting Covid for it to make my disorder worse or pass it on to my parents who support me after it impacted my ability to work and live independently.
2042,It sucks.
2043,"Been a year now since I've had a hug from a friend, seen a movie, smoked at a hookah bar, many of life's little pleasures."
2044,But it's kind of a prisoner's dilemma because if everybody were restricting themselves that way maybe things wouldn't be so bad.
2045,Totally understand your frustration with seeing people acting as if it's all a big joke.
2046,You are your own gotcha by this point.
2047,There will be complete and utter societal breakdown if it drags on to the end of this year.
2048,"We're already seeing the signs of this breakdown: people have just ""given up"" on precautions."
2049,"Psychologists and sociologists have long known the ""social end"" of the pandemic would come long before the medical end."
2050,"My guess is that _institutions_ (bars, events, concerts, retail, etc), with the support of a jaded public, will just openly give the finger to local govs en masse and dare them to enforce any of their rules."
2051,What are state govs gonna do?
2052,They wouldn't dare use the national guard especially if lockdowns are supremely unpopular.
2053,"Of course, that will all come to screeching halt when a new mutation arises that kills children and young adults at a 10% rate, and the _fear_ will motivate people into complying again."
2054,Not surprising.
2055,When I got sick the VA would not test me because they were using satellite locations to do testing.
2056,Thing is all the locations had been shut down or refused to work with the VA because  they don't pay their bills so I had to get tested out of pocket.
2057,The VA's number one priority has always been to delay treatment in the hope that the vet dies before they have to expend any money.
2058,Frustrated?
2059,His Gov failed to run out he full vax distribution process.
2060,That has killed thousands prospectively.
2061,"Worse, his passive statement is so typically French."
2062,Where's the triple team competition and cooperation for the best plan?
2063,I think it's at a beach front cafe waiting for better weather.
2064,This is more than a shame.
2065,Frustrated!!
2066,What gaul.
2067,"Also $3500 fine for breaking quarantine, followed by jail on 2nd offense."
2068,"They'd be the ones indoors without a mask, Yes?"
2069,6ft is such a scam.. any fluid simulation can show droplets travels way more than 6...
2070,Yet how many people thought 6 ft is safe without mask...
2071,Thanks CDC for playing down since day 1 and keeps playing it down.
2072,To ask.
2073,Jeez.
2074,Bunny answer.
2075,Bunny
2076,"In america, this means they xan sue the state for millions right..?"
2077,"Yeah, I read the preprint the other day."
2078,We really messed this one up.
2079," **Coronavirus daily case rate by race and ethnicity:**

Latino: 1,696 coronavirus cases per 100,000 Latino residents  
Black: 752 coronavirus cases per 100,000 Black residents  
White: 636 coronavirus cases per 100,000 white residents  
Asian American: 519 coronavirus cases per 100,000 Asian American residents  


Why is the rate so high among Latinos and low for AAs?"
2080,"And they have been warning the world for years for drug resistant bacteria, but the world does not seems to care yet"
2081,[removed]
2082,"I estimate that at least 1% of people reading this headline will know that ""UIrelief"" means unemployment money."
2083,Sanitization is useless theater.
2084,"The virus spreads by air, not by contact with surfaces."
2085,Most courthouses are old and have terrible air circulation.
2086,"Plus jails are often COVID hotspots, so that can also be a problem."
2087,"No, if COVID were to evolve to a point of vaccines being ineffective it would have to make dramatic changes to its spike protein that would probably make it bind less efficiently to the lung receptor."
2088,"I get that black people have Tuskagee and Henrietta Lacks as reasons for their skepticism, which I highly agree is valid."
2089,"But it’s just not applicable in this scenario when other races are getting vaccinated at the same time and the science is transparent, solidly backed and well-published."
2090,"It’s really frustrating and honestly irksome to see people, and especially those with healthcare backgrounds, turn down the vaccine for emotional reasons."
2091,High lethality inherently tends to burn itself out
2092,My favorite position as well.
2093,Sleeping on the streets is better than dying.
2094,I tested positive dec 1st &amp; we all quarentined &amp; December 15th I tested negative.
2095,"Now my brother is positive, can I get it again now?"
2096,"Or can I ""carry it"" without showing symptoms this time, and pass it on to others?"
2097,( We all plan on quarentining another 10-14 days.)
2098,Damn.
2099,I never saw this coming.
2100,Especially in Florida.
2101, *votes self instead*
2102,"dude, everytime i think my recovery is nearing 100% or even 90%, i'm knocked back down on my ass."
2103,my covid anniversary is in a month
2104,The only way your comment makes sense is if you don’t value the lives of others.
2105,Trump has zero say in how Illinois and this school district operate.
2106,His blame is on the national handing.
2107,This particular policy is the local level.
2108,"B117 isn't the finishing blow, it's the _set up_: by seeding tens of millions of additional cases, there will be so many opportunities for the virus to mutate that it becomes inevitable a mutation in the shape of the spike protein occurs and our vaccines are rendered moot."
2109,I think we'll end up in a permanent state of chasing our tail since we've lost all state capacity.
2110,"We can't tweak vaccines fast enough to keep up, let alone distribute."
2111,The concern is misplaced though.
2112,"You are worrying about my family if I send my kids to school, but not when we go to work?"
2113,"Its backwards, bc the schools open here have had almost no cases but both of our workplaces are riddled with cases."
2114,And yet we go to work.
2115,If we were paid to stay home there would be little damage to us but I assure you there is huge harm being done to my kids being at home.
2116,"The obsession with schools as vectors is just misplaced, based on all available facts."
2117,\&gt;Viruses typically evolve to transmit more and kill slower however the interconnected state of the world might change that.
2118,"&amp;#x200B;

\&gt;this is the thing that you said, and it is wrong, funnily even the sources that you grabbed disagree with you."
2119,"&amp;#x200B;

\&gt;Evolution of virulence theory proposes that parasites will evolve to an intermediate level of virulence when a trade-off exists between parasite transmissibility and virulence, where virulence is most commonly defined as the rate at which hosts experience disease-induced mortality

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt;intermediate isn't being selected for being mild."
2120,"&amp;#x200B;

\&gt;You don't know what you are talking about, virulence can be selected for."
2121,The above is your deleted comment.
2122,Which I have responded to.
2123,"I know why you deleted it, you do as well."
2124,"I will I suppose quote the great u/beyelzu

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt; viruses get less lethal over time isn't a theory, it's a rule of thumb."
2125,"&amp;#x200B;

Stop trying to gotcha."
2126,Please also dont insult my intelligence or my lack of expertise.
2127,Because we let greed be the only voice.
2128,"Government services have been privatized, and vulture capitalists only care about immediate short-term profits."
2129,We are witnessing the result of 40 years of privatization.
2130,"Let's put it this way: it is HIGHLY doubtful thatpatient zero did not originate in China, and even if it proves to be the case that it didn't originate in China, it IS a fact that the Chinese government \*actively\* suppressed information about COVID to its own citizens and the rest of the world, and during this time of denial many of Wuhan's 12 million citizens were not quarantined  - instead traveling freely (and naively) to within and without China which led to the propagation of the virus into a worldwide pandemic."
2131,That is a fact.
2132,"Until we find patient zero, or if we never find patient zero, the CCP will continue to deny any responsibility for the COVID pandemic and at the same time claim that the virus originated somewhere else."
2133,That is also a fact.
2134,It’s not like they’re going to pay you to be quarantined if you were exposed during jury duty either.
2135,Probably means masks at hospitals
2136,"800k is 8% of the people in the UAE total, not just of the citizens."
2137,"speaking of rats, rodents are a reservoir of one of the sars-cov-2 mutations."
2138,guess whats never going away :(
2139,The only way your comment makes sense is if you disregard the costs of keeping schools closed.
2140,American wannabes.
2141,last i checked india was the one with world largest medical supply production though.
2142,Out of the loop: why is LA so bad given CA has had some of the most restrictive lockdowns?
2143,"This is a *very* good fact that gets repeated often, and for good reason."
2144,But here's a little bit of nuance: a virus can be lethal and *still transmissible* if it has a long enough incubation time.
2145,It's like setting off a cluster bomb inside the body.
2146,"Sure, if you detonate them all at once, the host body dies and you don't get to spread."
2147,"But if you lay low for a week or two, spread around armies of yourself, and *then* detonate the bombs...why, you can detonate them as hard as you like, and you'd still succeed at the *transmission* part."
2148,Many schools have the kids stay in the same classroom while the teachers move around period to period.
2149,I'm pretty sure all the wildlife and corals are getting a much needed rest from the fat Americans and obnoxious Chinese.
2150,last I check Ko Phi Phi was blocked off just for that.
2151,Of course.
2152,And if school is to be held in person teachers should be put pretty high up in the vaccination priority.
2153,But my point is that being able to vaccinate teachers does not dramatical change the calculus of the benefit of in person schooling vs the increased risk of spread within the community that it causes.
2154,[removed]

2156,15 is the low end.
2157,not uncommon for patients with advanced lung disease to need 60 liters/min or more.
2158,"when they walk around the hospital on high flow, it's with 6 separate tanks."
2159,"Yeah, we're just gonna fucking get it aren't we?"
2160,"If you think CA has it rough now, that is with an R of _1.18_."
2161,"With B.1.1.7 and a few months, it goes to **1.3**."
2162,I am extremely locked down save for a bus ride to the outdoor gym a few times a week.
2163,I guarantee I'll pick up b117 from the community before I can get a vaccine.

2177,"Well to be fair, Florida is insane lol."
2178,I live in Oregon ha
2179,No one is talking about being locked down for decades.
2180,And I’d be all for your playing Russian Roulette as long as you only infected yourself and you signed away your right to an ICU bed.
2181,Personal choice is a wonderful thing as long as it’s truly personal and affects no one else.
2182,According to my doc the main risk with covid is the cytokine storm.
2183,"I would assume that if the lung capacity is reasonably normal, the risk is not changed substantially."
2184,"Get a o2 monitor though, learn to use it, and what your normal is in various situations."
2185,we were this close to success story.
2186,then election in sabah happened.
2187,fuck me side ways right ?
2188,The people who are willing to go out of the way to pay for or donate money to cut in line to get a vaccine are also more likely to skirt the mandates and restrictions already in place to protect people which could expose others to the virus if skirting those restrictions exposes them.
2189,"It sucks that they can cut, but each person vaccinated is 1/330,000,000 of the way closer to the end of this."
2190,Literally older than the bible.

2234,False.
2235,"I wasn't defending China or the CCP, I was pointing out that your rebuttal was weak."
2236,"And you read that as ""oh, this guy is OBVIOUSLY pro-China."""
2237,And I'm here to tell you that you're wrong.
2238,I'm not.
2239,"You can insist that I am, but the truth is, I'm simply not pro-China."
2240,I'm just pointing out the flaw in your weak rebuttal.
2241,Get a better one.
2242,"I know I’m not a scientist, Doctor, and am going to give myself the appearance of an idiot - but - I’m a steroid user."
2243,Have been for a few years.
2244,"I pin myself in the shoulder, using basically the same needles."
2245,"I can sanitize, draw (I’m pulling a fluid much, much thicker), sanitize again, pin and have everything put away in under 3 minutes."
2246,"I know there’s much more bureaucracy and paperwork  in a hospital setting, but they’re definitely not going at the speed they could even without this sense of emergency."
2247,About 50% is what I saw from Pfizer (their briefing document to the FDA).
2248,I don't remember what Moderna said.

2250,"&gt;	The vaccine escaped from their BSL-4 laboratory


Nice sarcasm, but I think you mean the virus, not the vaccine."
2251,Oh I absolutely understand.
2252,I was being sarcastic with my first line
2253,Yeah thanks for the info after several countries have been already overrun with it.
2254,This is why abbatoir workers are at greater risk.
2255,The virus lives longer in cold and freezing conditions.
2256,Something to keep in mind.
2257,100% mortality is a conservative estimate??
2258,?
2259,Who the fuck cares if Moderna makes a few billion dollars in profit?
2260,They are literally saving millions of lives and trillions of dollars.
2261,The problem is right now we are just not vaccinating any serious amount of people.
2262,"Of course it would be better to vaccinate the optimal people but if the option is vaccinate 1000 perfect people or 20000 imperfect people, I will take the 20000 any time."
2263,Perfect is the enemy of progress and while we sit and wait for the perfect groups of people to come in thousands are dying.
2264,"It doesn't have to be wide open either, but right now it's the max restrictions and it is just being wasted."
2265,"Makes sense, since the virus cannot travel from undocumented workers in the agricultural industry to good, god-fearing Americans."
2266,/s
2267,I'd say about 60% of my Facebook friends are anti-vaccine and my feed is loaded with a whole bunch of articles about how awful the vaccine is and everything that will happen if you get it.
2268,I try to talk them down a little bit but it is no use.
2269,I understand having concerns but at least do some research into articles you are posting.
2270,On a side note...one of my friends got the vaccine and developed Bels Palsy two days later.
2271,I'm still not convinced that it was caused by the vaccine but it did freak me out a little bit I will admit.
2272,"No, we outsource to other countries that don't have a shitty one party communist state manipulating markets and violating trade agreements."
2273,Why?
2274,Do you want to get sick or die I’ll give it to someone else who might die?
2275,Being stupid isn’t illegal.
2276,What good is reporting them going to do?
2277,Meanwhile the Oxford/AstraZeneca is being blocked for several months at least.
2278,Coincidence?
2279,Was just being informative.
2280,"I like teachers, they are good folks."
2281,2021 off to a great start...
2282,Who would take a vaccine made in China?
2283,"28th December is now the highest daily deaths since April, at 600: https://coronavirus.data.gov.uk/details/deaths"
2284,"Hawaii has 1/5 the population as New Zealand, and yet more than ten times the deaths."
2285,"Oh yes, they are probably evil aliens and invented covid just to spite us."
2286,"Instead of doing it by age, we need to do it by people living in a certain population density."
2287,"Probably should for their own protection, but the ones playing around need to get out of the way for someone else."
2288,"They are being highly irresponsible, given that hospitals are becoming overwhelmed, and their refusal is likely to add to that problem too."
2289,They of all people should realize this.
2290,UK strain starting to work its magic here as well?
2291,"I hate to say this, but the NYC messaging on getting tested is borderline insane."
2292,"The message is basically, ""Get tested... keep getting tested... everyday... no matter what."""
2293,"The lines are batshit crazy and they're everywhere and I'm like, ""is THIS the best way to prevent the spread?"
2294,"Putting strangers in differing long lines of people day after day instead of staying home when you can, masking up, distancing, and then waiting until you find out if you've been exposed to someone or feel ill?"""
2295,"Also, NYC has the lowest rate of vaccine administration IN THE UNITED STATES."
2296,I think Oklahoma is the bottom state at 28.5% but New York City is at 27% or so.

2369,People are dying of Covid mid-flight.
2370,The cruise industry wants to continue right now without any herd immunity.
2371,Companies wont turn down the dollars of the infected.
2372,The risk of death is extremely low.

2374,He should resign from his position at St. Joseph’s too.
2375,"That's what I think happened
 
A city like LA is still far from reaching that point."
2376,"If they go that route, the worst days are still to come"
2377,It seems you missed what I said; in this instance without a test we have every reason to believe they got another sickness than covid.
2378,Because they're just looking to be awful.
2379,"Seriously, they only post negative stuff in this sub."
2380,If they have access to the internet it means they have access to the same information as the rest of us.
2381,"If they make a choice not to get vaccinated, then I won't feel bad for them, gets me mine that much sooner."
2382,No.
2383,A mill is NOT chump change
2384,why is 2K the number?

1."

2389,2.
2390,More people get hospitalized.
2391,3.
2392,More people die from non-COVID causes due to hospitals being overwhelmed.
2393,4.
2394,"And finally, more people die from COVID."
2395,"Yes, if we were able to deploy the vaccine to half the population tomorrow, we would be fine."
2396,"Unfortunately, that's not the timeline we're on."
2397,You're right
2398,You want a perfectly healthy rich person to be able to skip the queue and potentially condemn someone who actually needs a vaccine for chump change?
2399,"So, did the groups that received the vaccines were ""magically"" in less contact with COVID than the placebo groups?"
2400,"Isn't it supposed to last... you know, forever?"
2401,Isn't that the point of getting fucking vaccine?
2402,Isn't the whole reason we're scared of the coronavirus because it's a specifically deadly single strain of flu?
2403,Science...constantly discovering the obvious.
2404,Or shit that can't be explained by science.
2405,"&gt; Without a more substantial vaccine rollout, they warned, “cases, hospitalizations, I.C.U."
2406,"admissions and deaths in 2021 may exceed those in 2020.”

I assume they're talking just about the UK, but wow."
2407,??????
2408,"You can be covid positive and not do a test, and still have the virus (obviously)."
2409,To get a positive test for covid-19 it has to be post-exposure (obviously).
2410,But you can have the virus and have a negative test result (not enough time since exposure).
2411,So what you said isn't true.
2412,They can’t do any of the elective surgeries that keep them afloat financially.
2413,Instead hospitals are inundated with Unprofitable Covid patients.
2414,Many hospitals will close in rural areas.
2415,"This is the downside of for profit medical industry, if saving the population does not help their bottom line, not their problem."
2416,This proves it can be done very quickly assuming having resources etc
2417,"I get now you can estimate infection numbers based on seroprevalence data, but what's the methodology that was used to determine deaths are underreported by 43%."
2418,"They just say there's ""multiplying factors"" without going into much detail."
2419,True
2420,"as far as what the news are reporting, the new strain is more contagious but not more lethal."
2421,"however, being more contagious also leads to more deaths"
2422,More transmissible isn't the issue.
2423,As long as the vaccine defeats the virus we are fine.
2424,"I'm from Canada, and I have no idea what you are talking about with 'rationing' healthcare."
2425,"They need to have a  statement ready for these time-wasters to sign, that puts them at the very end of the line."
2426,This is heartbreaking news.
2427,The movie industry is already getting fucked as it is.
2428,Can we also get that 2k stimulus?
2429,Thanks.
2430,People want to do these things because disease is dumb and the risk is almost noon existent.

2442,Two thirds is what the constitution says.
2443,Not thought so from their analysis so far.
2444,It's worth noting that the actual daily deaths figures are at about 600 at present - this headline figure is a backlog reporting effect from the new year + weekend.

2453,Why would China ban wet markets?
2454,"The vaccine escaped from their BSL-4 laboratory in Wuhan, not from the wet market."
2455,"It kinda did, unless it was manufactured in a Wuhan bio weapons lab."
2456,Those are really the only feasible options for covid’s origin story.
2457,"Imagine the World Cup with no fans.... Yeah, that's lame af."
2458,"Also a very young population and the lowest obesity rate in the world (2.1%, to be exact)."
2459,Could that have something to do with their low death rate?
2460,"Nah, couldn't be."
2461,&gt;It’s very suspicious that China is doing this while publicly saying the virus did not originate in China.
2462,Not really suspicious at all to anyone who follows China closely.
2463,"It's not even quite that, as you won't have antibodies in your blood from every infection you've ever had at all times."
2464,"You're only going to keep the antibodies on circulation for [a few months](https://www.webmd.com/lung/news/20200622/covid-19-antibodies-can-disappear-after-2-3-months) following infection, after which antibody levels fall to undetectable levels (but B-cells can produce more in the presence of a new covid infection)."
2465,"Maybe if the antibody test involved triggering the B-cells to produce antibodies (possibly in the presence of a vaccine), then it could work, but I'm just speculating."
2466,"For fuck's sake, Texas."
2467,"hahaha you’ve been following my lead the whole time, dill pickle."
2468,"What new material, weirdo?"
2469,"If only you just took the L, we wouldn’t have a life long conversation on your dweebiness"
2470,Stop letting sociologists and ethics committees decide who lives and who dies and just make it first-come-first-serve.
2471,We'd easily be close to 50 million vaccinated by now if anyone could get them.
2472,Not enough for herd immunity but probably enough to decrease infections and definitely enough to at least flatline them.
2473,"Also, less rich people spreading covid to the people that work for them."
2474,Thank Gaven Newsom for this.
2475,"The dumbass broke his own COVID restrictions, mishandled the fires, and hurt small businesses."

2580,Apple recently switched to MEMS resonators - tiny electromechanical timepieces - in a lot of their products because they're a little thinner than quartz components.

2584,Nobody's doing much with self-assembly of machines and *that's* something to be exceedingly careful about.
2585,Actually that's why it might be a good thing that the mRNA vaccines need cold storage.

2703,Shows how little people actually read and just upvote based on title alone..
2704,Hospital capacity will stretch further if medical professionals are protected from getting sick.
2705,It's unlikely that the CDC chief was right.
2706,The CDC assumed that we had a large number of truly asymptomatic individuals.
2707,"As more data came along, their projections appear to be off."
2708,We initially thought it was up to 70% of people that were asymptomatic.
2709,That got revised down to 40% in September.

2720,I mean literally the dutch are the living example of this.
2721,Dutch East India Company in the 19th Century + Huge Oil profits in the 20th century meant a lot of profit in the short term for the Netherlands during these periods.
2722,What did the Dutch do?
2723,"The country re-invested a lot of it back into the country as part of a kind of savings fund that benefits all, and many of the individually wealthy dutch re-invested it back into their families over generations."
2724,"Compound this level of economic decision making over 100 years and they're now one of the most stable, wealthy countries on earth."
2725,"I really hope all of this going on inspires a really angry economist to write up a new economic manifesto that countries/businesses listen to, that actually cares about stewardship."
2726,Just like what happened in the 19th century when the industrial revolution happened and the what happened in the 1930's during the first big stock market crash.
2727,The angry economists of those times paved the way to a better future of how to handle business &amp; economics as a whole.
2728,And everyone enjoyed a better quality of life because of it.

2736,And your competent Government.
2737,"Many sacrifices have been made in the UK, our scientists have developed an excellent vaccine in record time, and the NHS is working extremely hard."
2738,"Sadly, this cannot overcome the incompetence of our lamentable Government, whose policy responses to the pandemic are always too little, too late."
2739,We need to eradicate it.
2740,If we don't it will eventually mutate in such a way that the vaccine is no longer effective and then we're right back to the start.
2741,How has it been approved in Europe already?
2742,its okay for people to try to do better ya know?

2750,What about all the places with everyone wearing masks that have huge covid outbreaks now
2751,There are some instances where I can’t at work
2752,"Nope, The flu immunity lasts for a lifetime, with all known current viruses immunity lasts for six to 24 months."
2753,There's no such thing as like the generic respiratory virus where they're like magically all the same and thus your immune response is different against every different virus though you just don't always notice that because the end results are kind of the same either you stay sick and probably die or you get better.
2754,The only way to understand immune response is to look at the specific virus and then the animal's immune system in this case obviously humans.
2755,You can't cheat and just generalize them though you can look at the family of viruses and the closest genetic relative.
2756,In this case when you look at the closest generic relative you only wind up seeing an immunity based on antibody response that lasts 6 to 24 months and the 24-month Congress did more rare.
2757,So anybody who says there's going to be truly long-lasting immunity as in 10 plus years is probably talking out their ass regardless of what they use as antidotal science to back it up because you just can't say that unless years have passed and you can really prove it.
2758,"Yes, hold your breath for 10, 15, 30 mins....

2762,NZ didn't terminate flights either.
2763,Tens of thousands of people arrived in NZ during the lockdown and continue to arrive now.
2764,There were so many arrivals in March it was impossible to put them all in quarantine so the national lockdown was used to make the whole country a quarantine facility.
2765,When arrivals dropped in April the lockdown was eased and new arrivals sent to the state quarantine facilities.
2766,And politics.
2767,Gotta have something to report.
2768,Not by the hair on your chinny chin chin
2769,No.
2770,"The British studies have shown that it's no more likely to kill you than the standard variant, and may even be slightly *less* likely to put you in hospital."
2771,"But in infects more people, so deaths will go up."
2772,"Hell, it could even be less lethal and deaths would *still* go up if infectiousness goes up by enough."
2773,"fuck, so the death rates won't go down at all"
2774,"I want to move in with my grandparents in Korea for the next year but I’m not sure how dangerous flying is these days (from Toronto, Canada)."
2775,How risky would it be to meet up with elderly people after international flight?

Also, after these guys leave the rally today they will PACK the bars and hotel rooms, getting drunk, no masks, breathing and spitting all over each other."
2780,That is where the real danger lies and where the virus really takes off.

2783,Also many cases haven’t been reported yet

2790,"T cells don't necessarily provide long term immunity, at least not protective immunity."
2791,"For T cells to be activated, reinfection must occur at some level as they act on infected cells."
2792,"Also, detectable memory T cell responses tend to be rather short lived for this virus."
2793,"&gt;The United States has no large-scale, nationwide system for checking  coronavirus genomes for new mutations, including the ones carried by the  new variant."
2794,"About 1.4 million people test positive for the virus each  week, but researchers are only doing genome sequencing — a method that  can definitively spot the new variant — on fewer than 3,000 of those  weekly samples."
2795,"And that work is done by a patchwork of academic, state  and commercial laboratories."
2796,"Technically a lot more than two islands, but go off mate"
2797,Not blind.. doesn’t care 😞
2798,There is no evidence New Zealand’s position right now results from any policy or change in social behavior.
2799,It could very well be due to seasonality and natural dynamics.
2800,Other countries in both hemispheres took similar approaches as New Zealand.
2801,Results varied.
2802,"Many countries that did comparatively little ended up in the same place as NZ is now, as well."
2803,"NZ’s policies were not too dissimilar from lots of western countries, they just have a big PR campaign going for their politician, so they boast about themselves more."

2806,"Because he was scamming the insurance industry, not the poor."

2808,Your whole family?
2809,What.
2810,What months and what country?
2811,Were you confirmed positive both times?
2812,"The immune system is complex but i
youd think it at least blunt the effects the second time"
2813,Yes cause the majority are health care workers and most people over 65 don't work.
2814,So a 99.8% reduction in flu is “random chance”?
2815,Since flu also spreads internationally less flu in countries that are doing well with COVID reduction measures will also reduce flu in countries that aren’t.
2816,One person can start an outbreak.
2817,It that person wears a mask and washes their hands instead that can eliminate thousands of future cases.
2818,It goes to show who all the misinformation has been targeted at.
2819,I mean why would any reasonable citizen of another western country care so much about american politics that their fellow countrymen become an enemy?
2820,Unlikely and there's no reason to believe that.
2821,"When they say immunity, they probably mean you'll have some type of immune response but it sells better when you call it immunity because it sounds like you'll be immune."
2822,"Yeah, I’d be interested in the exact method used in determining how much death was underreported."
2823,"It isn’t reasonable to think our surveillance system is accurate enough to catch all deaths, however to this point most estimations I’ve seen put the range of undercount around 10-25%."
2824,This study jacks it up to 35% on Nov 19.

2830,Do we know how many of those 21 cases had a history of allergic reactions?
2831,Surely that’s an important detail
2832,"I think that people in India are reacting differently than those in the US.....These are all gatherings that have the highest rate of transmission - close proximity, inside, close friends/family so sharing/touching many of the same items/utensils, no masks AT ALL, eating and drinking around people who are yelling and talking thus spreading the droplets all over what everyone is eating and drinking...."
2833,"This sudden spread is due to american culture and action, not necessarily because of this new mutation."
2834,The high increase in cases surely is though
2835,"Carbon Monoxide is not flammable, which is why it's not regularly tested for in industrial supply Oxygen."

2837,"no its not, its the back log from New Years holiday, thats it 

same exact thing happened immediately after Xmas, there was a drop in deaths 26th - 28th then a huge spike for a couple days then back down to ""normal"" which is ~ 2,500/day 

the highest the 7 day moving average has been is about 2,700/day, when that number actually moves past 3,000 for a week or more then you can really get ready for the S to hit the F"

2841,"they DID do it better, that's the thing

I'm not disagreeing with the heart of your statement, I wouldn't submit to a totalitarian government either... but the totalitarian government allowed a lot of countries to really get a handle on Covid."
2842,Look at New Zealand.
2843,They went full authoritarian/totalitarian for a few months and they're more or less OK now.
2844,The U.S. Government is very free and HIGHLY fractured (basically a 50/50 split on opinions) and they did everything they could to make it worse every step of the way.

2856,"Or even better, they should've been greatfull?"
2857,"&gt; EU/US probably should start thinking about legislation that would allow for border closures between countries/states

You'd have to tear up the entire USA and start over again in order to make this a possibility."
2858,In many places state borders are largely indistinguishable.
2859,Then don't get mad at the businesses for not helping out with PPE or other machines.
2860,"If I own a factory that makes air conditioners or fans, I'm not going to start making ventilators when I might not even get money for my own resources."
2861,I'm going to continue to do what I do to make money and stay in business.
2862,If I did decide and had huge losses it's possible I would go under and add my employees to the unemployment line.
2863,If the government gave me the money necessary to convert my machines into making ventilators then I could do that.
2864,There would also be a contract to buy said ventilators.
2865,This was the entire point of the War Powers Act in 1941.
2866,Hundreds of businesses were given money from the government to make supplies for WW2.

2868,OWS has been a huge success.
2869,"Sure, there have been bumps along the way, but it funded a 95% effective vaccine and the US has vaccinated the most people of any country."
2870,"Aldo Raines asks ""would you take that bet?"""
2871,How can I become a citizen of such a bad ass country?
2872,Asking for a friend.
2873,"&gt;If immunity lasts 1-8 months, please point me to the millions of confirmed reinfections we should be seeing right now out of the 87 million confirmed cases worldwide."
2874,You wouldn't have millions of reinfections.
2875,"You'd have around 100,000 reinfections globally, which isn't that far off from what we calculate as the true number of reinfections."
2876,The reason being is that most people haven't even had a first infectious exposure event.
2877,Having a first and second exposure event would be even rarer.
2878,"Second off, it's a certain percent of people that fail to seroconvert and generate antibodies against the virus."
2879,We calculate that out to be around 7% on average from numerous serological studies of recovered patients.
2880,"So, it's going to be a certain percent of the recovered patients that can be reinfected and would also need to have a second infectious exposure event."
2881,And that's in line with what we see from data collected from hospital surveys of potentially reinfected individuals.
2882,"As for confirmation, virtually impossible for the vast majority of patients that are reinfected due to no stored first sample."
2883,"Additionally, we also can't determine if a person is reinfected if homologous reinfection happens (like it does for other coronaviruses) because the samples would be the same."
2884,I guarantee it.
2885,"I dont know how things are where you all live, but where im from no one takes this virus serious!"
2886,Some will where mask due to stores making people but other than that its business as usual.
2887,"“Im in the states, southern”."
2888,Now the big thing is “im not getting that vaccine” ive heard everything from “there’s a chip in it” to their going to sterilize everyone with it ect!
2889,I have lost all faith in my community and nation for that matter.
2890,So apathetic and ignorant.
2891,"Most are more concerned with the damn election and how trump will prove theres fraud, unbelievable."
2892,"So yeah the new variant is more than likely spreading like wildfire, why wouldn’t it?"
2893,Its not like we actually did anything as a country to stop it.
2894,"yes it does, if we give the vaccine to everyone older 65, we can reopen the economy because the death rates and hospitalizations will be severely low considering if age 65 and up are getting most effected."
2895,"Reinfection is still rare, and unless they had it gene sequenced, odds are they didn’t get reinfected.. also you can still show up positive in PCR tests for months, even after being symptomless

2896,Media are the enemy.
2897,These deaths aren't related to Christmas.
2898,Someone dying now would have caught the virus in early-mid December.
2899,"Haha good one, Americans will never stop talking about themselves"
2900,"https://www.google.co.uk/amp/s/www.bbc.com/news/amp/uk-england-54530231

Nope, the NHS is struggling to get staff."
2901,It's simple virology.
2902,A virus wants to spread.
2903,"That is it's ""goal,"" so to speak."
2904,"If a virus kills its host, i.e."
2905,"is more deadly, it spreads less, and eventually will end the viral spread."
2906,"Therefore virus mutations that end up being more contagious win out, and more contagious viruses tend to be less deadly."
2907,Are majority of the people getting vaccinated under 65 so far in the USA?
2908,I think the focus on teachers is two fold...first they're organized and capable of advocating for themselves in a way that retail and service industry workers are not.
2909,"Second, they spend extended periods with their students (increasing the likelyhood of spreading an infection) where a retail worker usually is in close proximity to a customer for only a couple of minutes."
2910,"Also kids are bad at wearing masks, though it could be argued adults aren't great at that either...and there are a lot of older teachers in high risk groups."
2911,If you have to be near someone does holding your breath make a difference ?
2912,I've been irrationally optimistic way too long to remember something like that.

2922,A third of the population and more isolated than New Zealand.
2923,"Yet, Hawaii has 10x the amount of cases and deaths."
2924,“Seasons make no difference” is blatantly false
2925,what I am getting it is I wish the vaccines would be given to them first.
2926,Instead most of the people who have got the vaccine are under 65.
2927,We can make the death rates less than 50 a day in the USA if all old people get vaccinated.
2928,"I don't give a fuck about ""oh they're old"", I give a fuck about them getting them vaccined first."
2929,"So the profits will all be going to the scientists and engineers who developed the vaccine, not the shareholders who did nothing?"

&gt; The subset of people in the US who are anti-mask, anti-lockdown, pro-“covid is a conspiracy”...

2977,"For those who would otherwise skip over this:

DKA is a state of low insulin or insulin being blocked by other hormones."
2978,It can be caused by normal kid stuff like getting a cold or being really upset or forgetting your meds - especially if those things pile up.
2979,"It's possible with either kind of diabetes, but more common in type 1 (juvenile onset)."
2980,"It's roughly as dangerous as a severe allergic reaction - life-threatening, frightening, and painful but easily treated with insulin, IV fluids, and careful observation."
2981,Only if shes outdoors
2982,Because that’s too logical to fit the narrative being pushed.
2983,Tbh teachers should have the option to teach virtually as long as it’s live lectures.
2984,Under no circumstance should someone spend 2-3 hours recording a lecture then get paid for a week.
2985,Will prior infection or vaccination prevent infection with the new variants?

2994,What?
2995,u/StockedAces you didn't read the article.
2996,My thoughts exactly.
2997,"He's typically a straight shooter, so I don't think he would say this if he didn't truly think it was going to happen."
2998,"Yes, the virus was spreading - with almost 100% probability - after it originated in China either mid-2019 or maybe even earlier."
2999,"We know these date via genomic analysis, with more analysis to come."
3000,"It is interesting that the Chinese government is forbidding the WHO to visit Wuhan at this time, for further investigation."
3001,"[It is well known that Doctor Li Wenliang was summoned and admonished by Wuhan police Wuhan police ""making false comments on the Internet about unconfirmed SARS outbreak"", after Doctor Wenliang claimed that COVID was a new coronavirus variant."
3002,"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Li_Wenliang)

So, to claim that China ""didn't have any warning"" is not true."
3003,"Also, China does not permit any outside authority to freely question its health officials or its people about the origins of COVID."
3004,Why?
3005,It is also well known that China maintains a massive propaganda machine that most of the rest of the world does not trust because of its lack of transparency and penchant for outright lying and denial.
3006,This leads to great suspicion that  China knew something was wrong and purposely hid the truth about COVID.
3007,"In fact, China claims otherwise, but China appears unwilling to let the WHO into Wuhan."
3008,Why?
3009,What I will give China credit for is the intense lockdown once it realized that its public relations propaganda machine would be unable to contain what was a serious and growing pandemic.
3010,"Proof that the people of Wuhan knew more than the Chinese government admitted was made clear when hundreds of people - shown in a video that was able to get through the Chinese-controlled Internet - shaking their fists at President Xi when he toured the city after massive deaths to assure everyone that ""everything was OK'."
3011,"To this day, China has not allowed any outside authority to audit how many people died in Wuhan, or elsewhere, in China from COVID-19."
3012,"Admittedly, the West (or parts of it)  were derelict in their management of COVID."
3013,There are many ignorant people - including among those who govern - in the West.
3014,That is a fact.
3015,"That said, it is ALSO a fact that before China locked Wuhan down, many, many of its 12million people traveled to Europe's great capitals  on vacation and business; they also traveled within China because it was near the holiday."
3016,One large question remains.
3017,How many Chinese citizens either died of or contracted COVID.
3018,"Staying with your claim that the virus was circulating for months before China finally admitted it was real, how is it that virtually no deaths or contracted cases were reported outside of Wuhan."
3019,"Most epidemiologists of repute find that a very strange claim, but there is no way to verify the truth of the claim because China will not let in outside auditors."
3020,Why?
3021,Reports of two ICUs of patients dying in Egypt after Oxygen failure.

3103,Essentially nobody around the world has the manufacturing capabilities ready.
3104,Completely new facilities would have to be build which would take many months if not a years to be completed.
3105,While vector based vaccines have been manufactured in many places around the world for decades.
3106,That's why Astrazeneca can partner with many around the world to mass produce.
3107,Also vector vaccines are much much easier to handel because they don't require an extrem cooling chain and are over 10x cheaper per dose.

3150,Faster spread vs before.
3151,I don’t think there is very much good evidence that the measures don’t create as many problems as they solve.
3152,Lots of unintended consequences.
3153,Like when people crammed in trains in the UK to escape the lockdowns before they went into effect.
3154,"Or conversely, what happened in India when they tried to avoid that happening and announced a hard lockdown after hours effective immediately, then had people rioting because they didn’t have enough food to last the lockdown because they weren’t prepared to lockdown."
3155,People died of exhaustion trying to walk hundreds of miles to get home where they had food with everything they own on their back.
3156,I know somebody who starved to death as a direct result of a nursing home quarantine in Canada.
3157,In my town the food bank had to close under the rules (unintended consequence for sure) while the liquor store and head shop stayed open.

3206,"Both the FDA (who paid way too much attention to slicing the baloney as thin as possible with respect to who ""deserved"" the vaccine) and OWS (who mandated that each state have a plan that quickly just devolved into a baloney slicing exercise) seriously fucked up."

3227,Well it's hard to send an invitation for vaccination to someone who is undocumented how you contact them when you don't have details
3228,Or you could raise taxes a tiny percentage to extract that from those with means and still make sure that everyone has equitable access to the vaccine.

that is a huge difference"

3308,"&gt; COPENHAGEN, Denmark (AP) — A senior Swedish official resigned Wednesday after a vacation to Spain’s Canary Islands for Christmas and New Year's, saying “the important thing is how we as a society handle the pandemic and all focus is on the incredibly important task.”  
&gt;  
&gt;The departure of Dan Eliasson, who had headed the government agency responsible for civil protection, public safety, emergency management and civil defense since March 2018, comes as the Scandinavian country has seen a recent spike in virus cases."
3309,"&gt;  
&gt;And last year, the agency known as MSB, sent out text messages to millions in Sweden urging them not to travel."
3310,"&gt;  
&gt;But the 59-year-old Eliasson was photographed several times in December in the Canary Islands."
3311,He told the Expressen daily that he had “given up a lot of travel during this pandemic” and has a daughter living on the islands.
3312,"&gt;  
&gt;“The important thing is not me as a person,” Eliasson said in a statement Wednesday."
3313,"“The reason for my position is that MSB as an authority should have the best possible conditions to carry out its important assignment.”  
&gt;  
&gt;Earlier Tuesday, he met with Home Affairs Minister Mikael Damberg to discuss the possibility of continuing as head of the agency."
3314,The agency said that Eliasson at the meeting saw it was difficult given the reactions.
3315,"&gt;  
&gt;""That is why Dan Eliasson has today asked to be transferred from his job as head of authority and director general of MSB,” the agency wrote."
3316,"&gt;  
&gt;Damberg told Swedish broadcaster SVT that “MSB as an authority must function during the pandemic."
3317,"Dan Eliasson misjudged this and it has had major consequences.”  
&gt;  
&gt;Sweden has stood out among European nations for its comparatively hands-off response to the pandemic."
3318,"The Scandinavian country hasn't gone into lockdowns or closed businesses, relying instead on citizens’ sense of civic duty to control infections."
3319,"&gt;  
&gt;Swedish newspaper Dagens Nyheter said Eliasson, the former head of Sweden’s national police, didn’t inform anyone, not even Damberg of his vacation to the Canary Islands, noting it's not routine for senior MSB officials to inform their superiors of holiday plans."
3320,"&gt;  
&gt;Sweden, which has opted for a much debated COVID-19 approach of keeping large parts of society open, has reported 469,748 confirmed cases and 8,985 deaths, which is far more than its Scandinavian neighbors."
3321,To the US.
3322,Around half of the population but only about the size of California and it’s definitely not as isolated as NZ.
3323,"close to 100% masks here

3324,And then probably a couple more times until April/May.

3326,"Several balcan-countries are in the EU, but it is written like no balcan countries are in the EU."
3327,"Also, EU countries can be poor, but it is written like all EU countries are rich."
3328,Hungary or Bulgaria are not rich countries.
3329,My county in California was starting to recover and then the last few days it started going up again :/
3330,There’s no worrying.

3393,"I am sure if I had a choice to go on lockdown for another 28 days or 3 months or whatever, or if I could wear a hazmat suite for 2 weeks with full pay, I would take the 2 weeks."
3394,I do not think it is responsible to make such a strong claim about this.
3395,"Both airborne concentration levels and exposure time, as well as distance, are known to be factors in transmission in poorly ventilated spaces."
3396,I think you are potentially spreading misinformation and a registered professional such as yourself should refrain from this behaviour or use more measured language and cite specific reputable sources and any relevant counter sources when making such claims.

3405,CA *had* some of the most restrictive lockdowns early on and that's might be why we were doing pretty okay for most of 2020.
3406,But the current lockdown is nothing like what we had last March/April.
3407,"A small handful of things are closed (schools, in-person dining/bars, theme parks, campgrounds)."
3408,Almost everything else is open at either limited capacity and/or outdoors only.
3409,"I suppose that still might be ""strict"" compared to the rest of the country but it really doesn't feel like a lockdown."

3425,"Can confirm, since 2007 and before."
3426,For most scientists/academics it wasn't an if but a when.
3427,It was often a topic of our lab discussions.
3428,Bananas to have lab meetings remotely talking about emerging infectious disease while an emerging infectious disease ravages the world.
3429,"Also, I have no idea why this is the case — there’s really no excuse — but for some reason we have a really low number of icu beds available per capita compared to other states."
3430,So any major outbreaks can drown places fast.
3431,Plus so cal has  more anti maskers than other dense spots in California
3432,This is why the hospital I work at created a “stand-by” list for people who aren’t eligible to sign up and receive a dose in case there were extras about to go to waste.
3433,I did.
3434,What was i supposed to find?
3435,"It's not the ICU's that use this, it's something CDPH made up:

&gt;“If a region is utilizing more than 30% of its ICU beds for COVID-19 positive patients, then its available ICU capacity is reduced by 0.5% for each 1% over the 30% threshold."
3436,"So let's a hospital has 50 beds occupied by covid patients, 40 occupied by non-covid patients, and 10 beds free."
3437,"That hospital has ""0% available ICU capacity""."

3459,"All you need to do is communicate with the public that the vaccine takes a few weeks to take effect, really not that difficult."
3460,"&gt; Finally, I would submit that stopping the spread is at least as important as preventing serious disease."
3461,If you can vaccinate your most vulnerable populations quickly this is less important.
3462,&gt; The problem is that we don't know if the vaccine stops you being infectious.
3463,No we don't.
3464,"However, we do know that about 500 brits a day are dying of the disease, we can just use the first fact to vaccinate as many of the most high risk groups as possible to reduce mortality and the numbers in hospital which alleviates the majority of the pandemic."
3465,The sort of numbers the UK is looking at is a population worth about 90% of all deaths in the UK receiving dose 1 by mid February.

3468,"Unless I’m misunderstanding what you mean, the reason why teachers are at risk is because they interact with so many different students."
3469,I work in a small school (not in America and we’re online anyway) and on an average day I probably have contact with at least 100 different children.
3470,Relatives might have longer exposure to a small group of children but teachers are exposed to a large number of children each working day which increases the chance of coming into contact with an infected child.

3477,"If you think it is ""just old people"" then look at the data again."

3479,Do you think that you have the right to ask anyone else to do that?
3480,"Because pushing for ""opening things up"" is exactly that, and pushes at risk people back out into the world."
3481,"The question, you wont answer but should is this: how many dead people is an acceptable number?"

3485,1% of US population got covid19.
3486,"If that's China, that number would be 140 million people."
3487,We don't even have 140 million hospital beds in the entire world.
3488,Newfoundland?
3489,Im originally from there myself.
3490,Currently in South Korea and travel regularly to Vietnam.
3491,Its really a stretch to compare the two in any imaginable way
3492,"No, a lot of foreign workers"
3493,Court rooms do have venting tho.
3494,Hows that relevant?..
3495,"&gt;The Chinese side said our actions were anti-China

Oh no, that must have hurt."
3496,"Nice job going out of your way to make a speculative argument about why America is the worst...  ""Italy and the UK have more deaths per capata?"
3497,"Oh that must be because those Americans don't know how to count, also even if I accept that the data is accurate, here's an excuse about population density for why other countries should have more dead people and America is the worst."""
3498,"You should look at the age profiles of those being hospitalised in your area, it will surprise you."
3499,It’s not just old people being hospitalised.
3500,If your intention is to create divide in your biggest nemesis however...
3501,"there's no such thing as full protection so no one should be talking about that term as a real concept anyway, rendering this debate moot."
3502,[removed]
3503,Death and suffering have been taken out of sight in the modern day society.
3504,It happens in hospitals and care homes or simply at home.
3505,"Add to that most people (fortunately) never lived through a war, low child mortality and good healtcare."
3506,All in all witnessing dying and death is increasingly uncommon for people.
3507,This plays a big part in why people find death numbers so abstract and it doesn't move them in to changing their behaviour.
3508,This came across my facebook feed cause I follow them.
3509,"I used to work at this hospital, it was a great place to work!"
3510,It's not a huge community but cheers to them for figuring out a way to distribute the vaccine rather than letting it waste!
3511,"Also, best damn hospital food I ever had lol."
3512,I said immoral which is different than amoral.
3513,If I am able to fearmonger with my Reddit comment then maybe the science behind only doing what is a 52% effective dosage isn’t as good as your governments are telling you they are.
3514,I am done having this conversation as I feel there’s nothing more to add.
3515,[removed]
3516,I don't think that's the problem here.
3517,Part of the reason could be orofecal transmission resulting in a very benign intestinal form of Covid.
3518,The Dharavi slum in Mumbai for example had a much lower IFR compared to Mumbai non-slum (by a factor of 4).
3519,I remember reading a paper too that showed that Covid mortality was higher in communities that have access to clean water.
3520,This correlation still stood up when data waa adjusted for confounding factors like age.
3521,That doesn't mean you should undermine the approaches of elsewhere though and brand them as 'medically amoral'.
3522,That's fearmongering.
3523,"&gt;It would be interesting if the SA strain turns out to be a mutation of the UK strain, rather than an independent mutation."
3524,That would be convenient as a medicine that can deal with the UK one has a higher chance of being effective against the SA one.
3525,3-4 weeks to reach ~80% immunity and then the second dose should be given.
3526,But there are already multiple (likely many) strains of COVID.
3527,Isn’t it possible that reinfection can occur from catching a different strain from the first time?
3528,I'm fucking tired as shit.
3529,I've been having what may or may not be a sore throat that is on and off ever since I finished my semester in December.
3530,"I've been inside ever since, and I've missed the snow that came (and probably won't come to NY this winter again)."

3532,I'm actually scared that whatever I have will last for months.
3533,Madness to think all that has gone on over the last 10 months this has still to be implemented.
3534,"No, he didn't."
3535,The knesset gave it's citizens time to prepare for the lockdown in order so to not to create a rush on supermarkets.
3536,"My public health officials are saying two vaccines so like I said, your personal opinion in this case is of no consequence to me."
3537,"Jesus christ, close non essential retail so I can stop being extra scared for people I love."
3538,Move other things to curbside pick up.
3539,This is insane.
3540,That brings the list up to four countries who have approved the Oxford/AZ vaccine for use afaik.
3541,"The UK, India, Argentina and now Mexico."
3542,"I was permanently excused from jury duty when I asked about the dress code, specifically whether or not my t-shirt that said ""ask me about jury nullification"" would be allowed."

3544,Pfizer is a drug company whose job is to protect their shareholders and minimise the risk of lawsuits and reputational damage.
3545,They are not prioritising your health.
3546,"Listen to you public health officials, it's their job to protect your lives."
3547,Now if your public health officials are saying something different to elsewhere then listen to your local ones.
3548,But don't pretend a drugs company has your interests at heart.
3549,"Public health is and has always been a cost benefit analysis, it's silly to pretend otherwise."
3550,No fucking way I’d go sit on a jury right now.
3551,My interpretation was that we could still be using the tier system regionally based on local flare ups  rather than full lockdown by then but he didn't elaborate so I'm merely speculating
3552,They didn't even apply for visa but ok.
3553,"Breaking News.....they've now got these things called ""pharmacies"" that can administer vaccines."
3554,Unfortunately we are hearing of a lot more deaths in younger ages with this variant.
3555,I am quite scared of it to be honest as I have a girlfriend with asthma.
3556,Fingers crossed she gets the vaccine soon but i dont think it will be until April/May
3557,"Rational, logical things of course."
3558,Lol doubt they have any interest in that
3559,"That's very sad, I hope she pulls through."
3560,"Well with all due respect, nobody can skip just 10 days ahead."
3561,"You need to take it into account, especially with the epidemic that is currently raging in the UK."
3562,There is also the probability of a false sense of security.
3563,"People may take more risks after their jab, which could more than offset the probability of the vaccine causing immunity."
3564,"Finally, I would submit that stopping the spread is at least as important as preventing serious disease."
3565,The problem is that we don't know if the vaccine stops you being infectious.
3566,Sorry but the UK is being cavalier about this imo.

3573,That’s why the scientists who did the medical trials keep telling them not to do this?
3574,Yeah I’m glad I won’t be getting half a vaccine since that was not what was tested.
3575,Cost benefit analysis is a tool of governments not doctors as doctors are meant to do no harm and I can’t think of a single government that wouldn’t.
3576,But if you’d like me to say you won the argument sure ok idc either way homie.
3577,I currently work in the ER and you’d be surprised what the fda and joint commission will let fly currently.
3578,It’s like there’s no rules anymore lmao.
3579,I personally get more and more surprised every day.
3580,"Yep, definitely me."

3599,"Therefore, by not issuing visas they ARE blocking the investigation - are you really this ignorant?"

3603,"The sort of the consensus I've heard from professionals is that schools should be a priority to open and very likely aren't super-spreading the virus *BUT* schools should only open with low levels of community transmission (and a few other factors like hospital capacity, capacity for mitigation measures, etc.)"
3604,"Of all times, why are schools opening *now* when community transmission levels are at an all-time high??"
3605,"Sure, the second wave isn't hitting Chicago as bad as, say, LA, but their community transmission levels are still significantly elevated from just a few months ago."

3618,"The three piles are “needs immediate attention and can be treated with resources on hand”, “needs immediate medical attention but is beyond saving with resources on hand”, “non immediate need for medical attention or can be saved without consuming the resources on hand” 

What you are trying to say is that the situation has become so dire that hospitals have reached the equivalent of battlefields where there resources are stretch so then that they simple can not save everyone they should be able to."

yes it’s messy
especially in some states/counties even with mask mandates you only have 50 to 80 % compliance yet still see a strong statistical signal."
3621,Like what is it with gas stations?
3622,I never see people wear masks inside the gas station mini marts.
3623,Do they think Corona cant get them inside the gas station?
3624,"This one made me chuckle, thank you"

## Abstract

Lasting immunity will be critical for overcoming the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)."
3843,"However, factors that drive the development of high titers of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies and how long those antibodies persist remain unclear."
3844,Our objective was to comprehensively evaluate anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in a clinically diverse COVID-19 convalescent cohort at defined time points to determine if anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies persist and to identify clinical and demographic factors that correlate with high titers.
3845,"Using a novel multiplex assay to quantify IgG against four SARS-CoV-2 antigens, a receptor binding domain-angiotensin converting enzyme 2 inhibition assay, and a SARS-CoV-2 neutralization assay, we found that 98% of COVID-19 convalescent subjects had anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies five weeks after symptom resolution (n=113)."
3846,"Further, antibody levels did not decline three months after symptom resolution (n=79)."
3847,"As expected, greater disease severity, older age, male sex, obesity, and higher Charlson Comorbidity Index score correlated with increased anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody levels."
3848,"We demonstrated for the first time that COVID-19 symptoms, namely fever, abdominal pain, diarrhea and low appetite, correlated consistently with higher anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody levels."
3849,Our results provide new insights into the development and persistence of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies.
3850,&gt; We don’t look to be getting the vaccine?
3851,?
3852,How is it used for someone collecting a nasal swab and realizing someone who has had no symptoms for two months is testing positive?
3853,Do we still say shedding?
3854,This is really great news... for the rest of the world.
3855,Whereas in south africa... we look on and hope that our government eventually finds someone to bribe them for the contract to buy the vaccines from them.
3856,"So probably 2023, given that demand is currently high."
3857,But at least these data suggest we'll be great then!
3858,I'm basing this off literally no actual knowledge and I am more than willing to be proven wrong.
3859,But as far as I am aware it's very unlikely for a virus to become simultaneously more infectious and lethal.
3860,"So I believe the chances are lethality is probably the same or slightly lower, hell it could be significantly lower but the massive increase in cases is what's driving the increase in death."
3861,You do understand the IFR for kids in COVID is literally lower than the flu right?
3862,"Also, grade schools are not drivers, they merely correlate with community spread."
3863,"Ok but your claim is ""New York alone has more expired doses than they do people vaccinated"" Do you have any evidence to substantiate this or did you just make it up?"
3864,Exactly.
3865,Their lack of openness really comes back to haunt them here.
3866,"They *may* have a vaccine that's just fine, but even then they shouldn't be surprised it will take them a lot of effort to get people to trust them on it."
3867,I think that was meant to be more of a threat to dissuade than actionable...

3869,They need to be replaced.
3870,Simple as that.
3871,Well people don't want to get tested and to be put in quarantine.
3872,If people werent just selfish assholes that issue would be elimanted.
3873,I am lucky that i am still studying ( well kind of- online learning sucks) so i don't really have to go anywhere except basic shopping.
3874,I don't want to get it but am almost certain that i would not die from it but the thousands of people dying from it would say otherwise.
3875,Do you understand why a person reading your unfiltered informed opinions on the topic without me asking these clarifying questions would be apt to believe that 7% of infections are both susceptible to reinfection and much more likely to die than others (to an unspecified degree)?
3876,And how without context your words are scary?
3877,&gt;	My research is not concerned about these individuals unless we start to see some sort of pattern emerge (which might be coming soon with mild/asymptomatic individuals that have lower titers).
3878,And you keep pushing for possibly more severity in the data when we don’t know at best and at worst this is a non issue.
3879,"I think what I’m frustrated with is that, as a layperson, I look to you for guidance and I get a lot of out of context facts that are disconnected from reality."
3880,"It’s not your job to assuage fears, but if you’re commenting on this sub as a specialist I do believe it’s your responsibility to say “vaccines work and will continue to work but here is what I have been studying on natural antibodies and reinfection."

3927,I can’t learn or change my thinking by being attacked for asking.
3928,I don’t have an answer (obviously) but I am still uncomfortable mandating vaccines.
3929,I also assume that most who don’t vaccinate for other reasons rather than health reasons either A.  Don’t have enough information to make them comfortable with the vaccine or B. Don’t believe what information they have heard in regards to the vaccine or Covid and thus do not see themselves as not caring about their family.
3930,For sure it is a good idea to do that.

3982,No need to lock down whole countries if you stop the spread early.

3989,&gt; It sounds like you’re saying only currently circulating antibodies can protect against actual infection.
3990,"Essentially, yes."
3991,Circulating antibodies are protective immunity.
3992,"Without them, you will get some level of reinfection."
3993,&gt;And that long lasting antibodies are impossible.
3994,I never said this.
3995,Around 7% of people just don't seroconvert.
3996,They don't produce antibodies against the virus.
3997,&gt;Plus antibodies can create severe infection.
3998,This is what the studies seem to indicate.
3999,"In severe infection, the body goes into a hyperinflammatory response."
4000,This leads to the generation of autoantibodies targeting self which furthers the hyperinflammatory response.
4001,"&gt;Given that there’s no sure fire way to protect someone from severe COVID then, how does that shape public policy?"
4002,Why are we developing vaccines?
4003,Most people don't have a hyperinflammatory response...
4004,Most people clear the virus just fine and generate an immune response.
4005,My research is not concerned about these individuals unless we start to see some sort of pattern emerge (which might be coming soon with mild/asymptomatic individuals that have lower titers).
4006,"As for the vaccine, it doesn't induce this hyperinflammatory response."
4007,It produces a targeted response against RBD that should be protective at least against severe disease.
4008,Whether or not it's protective against spread is to be determined.

4058,It’s all you see.
4059,"For others, it’s part of the whole."
4060,So you say “7% of all documented infections don’t develop antibodies this means reinfection happens and we need to prepare for everything that goes with it” and they say “it’s likely that more than 93% of all cases develop antibodies and are protected for at least 3 months”.
4061,"I mean, yes that is one of its functions."

""We observe a small but statistically significant shift towards under 20s being more affected bythe VOC  than non-VOC variants (Figure 4), even after controlling for variation by week and region."
4093,"However, as with our earlier results, this observation does not resolve the mechanism that might underlie these differences."
4094,"Differences between the age-distributions of VOC andnon-VOC community cases  may result from the overall increase in transmissibility of the VOC(especially during a time where lockdown was in force but schools were open), increasedsusceptibility of under 20s, or more apparent symptoms (and thus a propensity to seek testing)for the VOC in that age range."""

4153,Meanwhile in the US people are joking about breaking freezers to get the vaccines distributed.
4154,Now that I would agree with.
4155,Right now the US is probably where the UK was in September and early October.
4156,So March is when we would see it take over as the dominant strain if it follows the same trajectory as it did in the UK.
4157,Unless the US has it’s own strain which is entirely possible since the UK is not the only country with one.
4158,South Africa and I believe Nigeria have also identified similar highly contagious strains.
4159,That’s why the urgency to vaccinate needs to be at the highest level.

4219,I bet they aren't full of anti-vaxxers like America and France.
4220,The deciding factor is what economic historians call state capacity.
4221,It crude terms it's a measure of a government's ability to get shit done.
4222,It explains why Canada is doing better than the US but not as well as Australia or New Zealand.
4223,It's also why a lot of Asian nations are doing well.
4224,"you dumb fuck

if they are doing better than other states statistically, that means they have less people getting sick and suffering and dying than other states"
4225,I would add we have a ton of hospital capacity per capita compared to California and at least in Central Florida our medical system has managed covid care particularly well.
4226,"I read that, for Covid, the loss of smell is actually a sign the virus has infected the nerves and is making it's way along them to your brain cells."
4227,It's never fun when a virus reaches your brain cells.
4228,"Winter, UK variant, not actually testing (so not tracing) that'll do it"
4229,Probably why Florida is letting their seniors camp out for doses.
4230,They know it's coming.
4231,&gt;  And how without context your words are scary?
4232,I hope they do end up scaring some people into taking things more seriously.
4233,Especially those that may have been infected early on in the pandemic with the original Wuhan strain rather than something like D614G (as most of the original reinfection data came from this scenario indicating that there may be even less immunity against mutant strains).
4234,"Again, my goal is to get life back to normal as quickly as possible."
4235,"This crap has gone on far too long and if we back down now, cases spike, we may very well end up with vaccine escape, then what?"
4236,Are older individuals such as myself that are already past retirement age just supposed to not enjoy our later years?
4237,Are future generations just supposed to lock themselves away as soon as they hit the age that it becomes more deadly?
4238,That's not a very happy end of a life.
4239,&gt;And you keep pushing for possibly more severity in the data when we don’t know at best and at worst this is a non issue.
4240,"Because that's what the ""publicly"" available information on confirmed cases indicates."
4241,"Take a hint there...  Look up reinfection with N63, the seasonal coronavirus that targets ACE2."
4242,Higher titers in reinfection often leading to more severe infection.
4243,"There has to be some sort of ""self"" protection mechanism going on here."
4244,What I think it possibly happening is the antibodies being generated may be targeting self-virus complex (ACE2-Spike).
4245,"A good portion of these would be eliminated by the body rather quickly as they could potentially target cardiomyocytes (that also express ACE2), essentially killing off heart muscle."
4246,But some may survive.
4247,"If they do survive, second infection can be more severe on the cardiac side of things."
4248,"If they are eliminated, the body may recognize future ACE2-Spike complexes as being ""self"" and eliminate that B cell before it has a chance to respond to the infection."
4249,It's very complicated.
4250,&gt;I do believe it’s your responsibility to say “vaccines work and will continue to work but here is what I have been studying on natural antibodies and reinfection.
4251,I have never once said that the vaccine doesn't work.
4252,I have always said that I'm doing this because of the vaccine.
4253,It will become widespread quite quickly and I lost the source but I read it'll probably be the dominant strain within a few months

4285,I’m confused.
4286,Some people have already gotten it twice though.
4287,I’m not an expert but I am an avid follower of this type of information - I’ve also gotten the Pfizer first shot and will get the second dose in a couple weeks - this seems to be in line with my own experience and the experience of those around me who have also received the vaccine.

4361,Like you blaming me right now?
4362,A lot of it is that they didn't start having a lot of cases until after COVID had been around awhile.
4363,"In the Spring when COVID was at it's peak in NY, the recommendations for treatment were essentially no steroids, intubate them if they need more than 5L nasal cannula oxygen, they can't have any non-invasive oxygen except nasal cannula and maybe a simple face mask."
4364,Maybe hydroxychloriquine helps?
4365,Maybe zithromax?
4366,By the time Florida started having high numbers of cases of COVID we had some solid evidence in how to treat.
4367,"We knew dexamethasone improved outcomes, even dramatically."
4368,"We knew intubating people increased mortality and are now going out of our way to avoid it, including with high flow nasal cannula and even bipap, and with permissive hypoxia."
4369,We know know hydroxychloriquine and zithromax cause cardiac complications and that blood clots kill in these people.
4370,"In so many ways it can feel like we've made non-progress with covid, but looking back on April, it's truly dramatic how far we have come with treatment."
4371,The other factor is overwhelmed healthcare.
4372,"NYS had most of their COVID deathes in a few weeks, in NYC."
4373,Their healthcare networks were completely overwhelmed.
4374,Florida COVID cases have been spread throughout the state over many months.
4375,because virginia doesn't publish that
4376,No because in your example nobody can avoid the risk the company releases into the environment.

4384,Friends will come crawling out of the woodwork if you say you have extra doses of the covid vaccine to give away.
4385,"Fair call, just if they're limited by budget and distribution/application it might make sense to focus on more effective vaccines."
4386,"That said, that would work in a situation where people were able to control themselves i.e."
4387,isolate properly and wear masks etc.

4392,Yep.

4397,"&gt;Your first thought after reading a news article was to rush to the internet

I cited the vaccine efficacy study."
4398,"A nurse getting an injection in front of media and patting her arm stating, ""see, told ya it's safe"" isn't evidence of anything other than *she* had no immediate complications."
4399,Hopefully she doesn't have a delayed anaphylactic response--people with allergies were explicitly excluded from the study and we already know several vaccine recipients have had severe allergic reactions.
4400,"We wouldn't know if she went into anaphylaxis later that evening unless a news crew followed her home, but we do know anaphylaxis can occur for hours and even longer after incidental exposure."
4401,Your personal attacks are petty and amateur level trolling.
4402,Try harder if you really want to get under my skin and come with some evidence next time to support your position.
4403,"Could, but won't."
4404,"Not now, not after the 20th."
4405,This article is **malarkey**.
4406,"The first line is:

&gt; Infectious disease expert Dr. Anthony Fauci revealed that the U.S. could start vaccinating one million people per day in the next few days

Fauci said nothing about ""in the next few days""."
4407,The answer he gave was in the context of the first 100 days of Biden's presidency.
4408,"You can verify for yourself in the transcript of [This Week](https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/week-transcript-21-dr-anthony-fauci-stacey-abrams/story?id=75022446), which is a TV program he appeared on and that they are quoting from (which they don't even attempt to cite a source for."
4409,"&gt; Well, I mean, we’ve already heard the -- President Elect Biden talking about the kinds of things that he wants to see done and that’s going to be hopefully uniform throughout the country."
4410,"What the -- what the president-elect said about masks, everybody wear a mask, no exception."
4411,"Everybody for the first 100 days, probably well beyond that, but at least for the first 100 days."
4412,&gt;The goal of vaccinating 100 million people in the first 100 days is a realistic goal.
4413,We can do 1 million people per day.
4414,"You know we’ve done massive vaccination programs, Martha, in our history."
4415,There’s no reason why we can’t do it right now.

4421,Same.
4422,"Hardcore CrossFit, Jiujitsu,and training for Ironman."

4426,Jesus Christ it was a miserable experience..
4427,Not all bad news... do you realize how expensive children are?
4428,And in this economy?
4429,"Not to mention home schooling, which sucks."

4507,I’m gonna go out on a limb and assume you think people dying is a good thing *unless* it’s you or your family who’s gonna die.
4508,The burden of the disease will end sooner if we vaccinate people at the highest risks rather than randomly inoculate people so we can more quickly get to the cliff waiting until there’s more vaccines.
4509,"It's also important not to conflate ""normality"" with ""herd immunity"" (other than maybe masks at packed stadiums this summer)."
4510,"Once high risk groups have gotten vaccinated and this disease is no longer a threat to hospitals we can begin treating it like the flu, maybe while remaining cautious about superspreader events with thousands of people."
4511,"It's a shame that many of the people making this point are the ""great barrington"" people who have rightly been criticized, for arguing that we can achieve ""focused protection"" in an environment with significant community spread."
4512,"Because on the other hand, they are clearly correct that by vaccinating the high risk groups we can achieve *real* ""focused protection"" that makes community spread far less worrisome for senior citizens and people with comorbidities."
4513,"Thankfully, there have been at least a few non-""great barrington"" people with prominent voices in the public health community who seem to be saying the same thing, making the distinction between imagined ""focused protection"" by isolation of the elderly and real ""focused protection"" by vaccines."
4514,"And the political leaders of even very cautious jurisdictions have been using language of ""until vaccines are widely available"" which seems to amount to vaccination of priority groups, *not* ""full herd immunity."""
4515,"However, the risk of a growing chorus of ""yeah but's"" once deaths and hospitalizations die down in the spring is still there, which worries me a bit."
4516,Isn't it only 50% effective?
4517,Ireland is no better.

4528,It happens.

4530,It happens in rare cases with the flu as well.

4532,Rare.
4533,If they are asymptomatic and the PCR is a high cycle count.its most likely a false positive.

4555,What more evidence do you want?
4556,What does the science say?

4560,Fauci was right.
4561,"From the very beginning he said that it'll be a year until we'll have a vaccine available to everyone, he was right."
4562,"He said that 200K people will die from the virus when we only had 10K deaths (even I didn't believe that), he was right."

4604,"... and many of the front line medical staff are working in fields unrelated to COVID, e.g."
4605,"other areas of care, or even less/non-essential services that exist because they're money makers for the hospital."
4606,"At that point it becomes more of a stretch to say that ""everyone"" in healthcare should get the shot before, e.g., the grocery store workers who can't work from home, and need to show up on the job in the face of deranged anti-mask protesters..."
4607,But my point isn't to debate priority as much as it is to observe that the system is too complicated and it is artificially slowing down a process that really needs to be running much much more quickly.
4608,We have this complicated plan because politicians felt the need to get involved and virtue signal to their constituencies.
4609,The entire American political apparatus is founded on virtue signaling (regardless of who's virtues you subscribe to).
4610,"Even though the tiers came from the CDC, the complexity comes from having to administer programs that provide access at the right moment or have your state governor's terror visited upon you for giving access to the wrong person at the wrong time."
4611,"And then they get sick and act all shocked about how that could happen, must be those damn liberals, democrats, Russians or [insert random group of people]."
4612,"One of the issues they called out in my state was the fact that while they have the capacity to vaccinate all the hospital staff in less than a week, they have to plan on away to ensure they have proper coverage on top of folks getting exposed in the community, if a employee has a reaction and needs to take a day off they need to let them do that."
4613,"My hope is once you can start vaccinating without considering that, AND the flow of vaccine starts consistently coming in you can start vaccinating at a faster pace."

4654,Offering vaccines to people with a summons for jury duty is actually a pretty good solution once they up the bandwidth on the vaccination pipeline.
4655,"Ah yeah that’s true, I was just thinking abt that as well bc the antibodies respond to the same thing put into your body, also would explain the similar efficacy between the vaccines and preliminary covid immunity data"

4686,"Perhaps I wasn’t clear in the way that was worded, but they didn’t have any net excess deaths over the Covid deaths."
4687,I agree.
4688,Pandemics are hard to stop.
4689,People are imperfect and they don’t follow the rules.
4690,"What we have learned from last pandemics, but failed to implement this time, it is that quarantining does not usually work in most contexts."
4691,"In theory they do, but in practice life is messy."
4692,Top down approaches are quite messy.
4693,"You have Cuomo threatening to fine those who vaccinate ineligible people for 1,000,000 $, then have people complaining that vaccines are sitting on the shelves waiting for eligible people to get them while ineligible people are desperate for one."
4694,"You have the UK trying to contain a local outbreak of a super contagious mutation, and people run for the trains to get out of the area, packing shoulder to shoulder in trains to try to avoid the lockdown."
4695,"You have my town which shut down the food bank while leaving the head shop and liquor store open as “essential”(because it can kill alcoholics to go cold Turkey)

I know a person who starved to death as a direct result of an imperfectly planned nursing home lockdown."
4696,All of this is well-intentioned and has unintended consequences.
4697,"The bottom up way is imperfect as well, not everyone will comply, but those who do will be making judgement calls more appropriate for the unique situation in that place and time."
4698,No remember the summer will not cause cases to go down it's not seasonal at all even though it went down pretty much everywhere during the summer
4699,Super Mega COVID-3000
4700,74k cases reported on Monday alone in CA.
4701,Holy hell
4702,I was called for jury duty in Washington in November.
4703,I tried to use the Covid reasoning and they just said that everyone is required to be masked at all times.
4704,I was ecstatic when I called the Friday before to find out that all of the trials for my jury duty period had been cancelled.
4705,"Normally I love jury duty, but right now I was not up for it."
4706,"But they have shots ready to go, the people who are being prioritized right now just aren't getting them which is creating an artificial bottleneck."
4707,"&gt; Everyone says follow the science and when drs and psychologist are saying the kids are lacking social interactions and thats far more detrimental to their well being

Don't worry."
4708,People who agree that the potential detriment to their mental well-being is more important than covid are letting their kids hang out with their friends maskless.
4709,How much longer after results will the vaccine be approved?
4710,2-3 weeks?
4711,"So a politician requested it come back...

Doesn’t make it useful."
4712,"The politician also wanted the guard activated, forgetting that if a doctor or nurse is in the guard, it’s highly likely they are already working in a California hospital."
4713,"The lady was doing political showmanship, and was inept in her understanding of reality."
4714,This bug is going to mutate to the point that it makes an error in it's own code it can't work around.
4715,The proof reading system it contains can only do so much.
4716,The virus has just as much of a chance of  unintentionally turning on itself as it does becoming more 'fit' over time.
4717,It will likely continue to adapt to humans and attenuate over time becoming less and less lethal.
4718,How long that takes is the ?
4719,"In the meantime, let's get these vaccines ramped up and turn this shit storm around....."
4720,Thanks!

4722,The civil-military gap is alive and well....
4723,Have to disagree.
4724,"1918 was spread via travel for WW1, primarily by ships."
4725,That flu infected about a 1/3 of the worlds population at the time in just under two years and that was with no airlines and a lot less connected world.
4726,Covid is nowhere near that number.
4727,"1918 was much, much worse than covid in numbers of infection and deaths with far less travel capabilities and much less dense populations."
4728,That to me is a scary thought.
4729,I thought fully vaccinated meant 1 week after the 2nd shot.
4730,If she got the 2nd shot yesterday she has almost a week to go.

4782,"What about SARS, H1N1 or MERS?"
4783,And the lack of multiple/local sources has become an issue as well.
4784,fewer businesses means more people in the same places.
4785,Look how quickly LA is crumbling.
4786,"First the hospitals were getting full, now add massive amounts of people out sick, and Amazon, Costco, the mass transit system, and others are starting to fall."
4787,"soon it may be sanitation workers, and fire/police."
4788,"This could get wild, especially with ALL of the other shit headed toward the proverbial fan."
4789,"I've gotta be honest, I think this is the way to do it."
4790,I'm not loving the priority tiers anymore.
4791,The United States has almost twenty million vaccines distributed right now.
4792,We should be looking at around 6% of the country having received their first dose instead of 1.6%.
4793,The tier system works well in a perfect world but we don't live in a perfect world.
4794,"I want to see headlines about pharmacies running out of vaccines, not hospitals sitting on them because certain people working there haven't decided if they want them yet, and not nursing home residents and school teachers dying because of that inaction."
4795,I'm warming up to the idea of a complete abandonment of the career based prioritization in favor of a semi open vaccination system.
4796,"I think there should be some in reserve for those who are at disproportionately high risk, like those in nursing homes or those with serious comorbidities, but those should be a small amount of the total vaccines, not most of them."
4797,Most vaccines should just be going to whomever wants this over with.
4798,And yet this particular defendant had been awaiting trial for a year and a half.
4799,"That, to me, is as equally ridiculous as holding a jury trial during a pandemic and then not notifying anyone they were exposed to covid until after the trial."
4800,"Yea right, of course everything is China fault."
4801,"China knew Trump is so incompetent, releasing this virus would cause much damage to the US."
4802,"Therefore, they purposely released the virus in their own city, Wuhan, putting their own country and millions of their own citizens at risk, so that the virus could hopefully spread to the US to cause damage."
4803,"Yea, sounds about right."
4804,"OMG, I had the RvB series on my OG Xbox I modded."
4805,Those WERE the days indeed!
4806,At least we have a vaccine.
4807,No.
4808,You wouldn’t.
4809,"Because if all the ICU beds on land were full, there would be no doctors or nurses to man the beds on the hospital ships."
4810,"We say we have x many “beds” but we don’t mean beds, we mean beds that we can put a patient into and provide care to that patient."
4811,We have more beds than staff to man them.
4812,I remember when people were making fun of Vietnam for locking down an entire province after like a dozen cases.
4813,And now many other countries eat the bill for not acting quickly and strictly.
4814,That's a good point.
4815,So there's two bottlenecks in there.
4816,"All we know is at least 5.05 million shots have went into arms, but it's certainly not that number right now."
4817,"I imagine, if what the other poster said is true, there's probably vaccinations taking place as we speak in Kansas that won't get to the state tonight, and then as a result won't be recorded on a national level until...Wednesday, January 13th."
4818,"Which really doesn't matter, but it's annoying that we don't have an accurate picture."
4819,"But as long as it has a result on infections, it doesn't matter."
4820,"If having to wear an N95 for 11 hours straight would convince you to not take a trip that would save a life then you’re either an extremely callous person or a pathetically weak person, or both."
4821,It would be the same problem as what's happening with the healthcare/essential workers.
4822,You thawed the vaccines and more people rejected them than you expected.
4823,The people in the neighborhood scheduled for the next day aren't home today.
4824,So you waste time and mess up the organized rollout looking for random arms to jab.

4865,Blame it on Trump
4866,They investigated themselves and found no wrongdoing.
4867,"In addition to what the other person said, the article mentions that the work scientists did studying other viruses in the Coronavirus family (SARS and MERS)."
4868,"This is possibly the most important takeaway for people who are afraid that the vaccine development was ""rushed"":

&gt; When Chinese scientists published the SARS-CoV-2 genome sequence on the internet on Jan. 10, 2020, multiple vaccine programs were started within days because existing vaccine design methods could be repurposed."
4869,"This vaccine effort *has* gone way faster than any previous one, but in large part it's because we were able to hit the ground running."
4870,Scientists did not have to reinvent the wheel and design a vaccine completely from scratch.
4871,The new mRNA vaccine technique makes it easier and faster to make a vaccine for a virus once you've got its genome sequence.
4872,"Moderna was already developing their mRNA technique to deal with other viruses -- [here](https://www.modernatx.com/pipeline) is a list of what they've got in their development pipeline -- so when they heard about the new coronavirus they said ""hey, I bet we could use our stuff for this""."
4873,Kaiser was recruiting participants for Moderna's Phase II safety trials where I live (Seattle area) back in March; as far as I know those trials are technically still going on.
4874,"(From what I read in their recruiting material, ""vaccine testing"" mostly consists of you getting your shots and then waiting to see what happens."
4875,The Moderna/Kaiser trials wanted you to do monthly followup doctor's appointments for 14 months IIRC.)
4876,"Other aspects of why things went so fast include being able to throw a ton of money at clinical trials, being able to recruit trial participants fairly easily, running separate phases of the trials pretty much in parallel, and having this be the #1 priority for regulators to review the data."
4877,"(A normal drug or vaccine would have to wait in line behind all the other drugs the FDA would be reviewing, right?)"
4878,The high infection rate (particularly in the US) also had a silver lining of speeding up how long the Phase III efficacy trials took.
4879,"The drug manufacturers said ""we'll have to wait until we get X number of infections in our participants before we can look to see whether the real vaccines are doing better than the placebo"" and boy did they ever get X number of infections real quick."
4880,It took weeks instead of months.
4881,Now there is still a possibility of rare side effects or problems.
4882,"By definition you're not going to catch all of the one-in-a-million things that might happen when the trials were done with 30,000 people; you can't catch all the possible long-term effects in something that hasn't existed long-term."
4883,But they were tested with enough people to catch the common side effects and long enough that there's been time to catch the usual big things.
4884,Anybody who's afraid of long-term issues from vaccines needs to consider the long-term issues from getting the disease.
4885,We're learning more about those and they can be pretty bad.

4920,Not sure what you mean about the concentrators vs cylinders.
4921,In industry if you have to disperse gas to a lot of separate places you can't just run off of a single pipe due to the pressure drop that you would experience.
4922,"So there are high pressure ""accumulator"" tanks that hold pressurized gas that can be delivered locally."

4996,My wife is a teacher in Illinois too.
4997,She got a doctor's note excusing her from in-person work for the rest of the year.
4998,Her district is honoring that request since they're only other legal options would be to have her take FMLA or short-term disability.
4999,"If you can find a doctor willing to write a note like that for teachers around where you live, you can pretty easily twist your districts arm."

5010,I am referring to the fact that you still need to mail it out and that you do not get results in 15 minutes as several of the rapid tests promise.
5011,"$1,000 for 10 tests is cost prohibitive for many people."
5012,I will admit I do not know the cost of PCR tests at a local clinic.
5013,The key with the rapid testing is to do it daily since it is not as sensitive as the PCR tests.
5014,I do understand that this is not marketed or advertised as a rapid test but simply an at home test.
5015,I am just disappointed that the FDA is still not approving the rapid tests.
5016,I guess the target market is for individuals that want to avoid a clinic or doctors office....but they still have to go out to ship it off.

5063,"#####Fever and pain medications, unblinding, and primary event adjudication committees

&gt; ""That said, the higher rate of medication use in the vaccine arm provides further reason to worry about unofficial unblinding."
5064,"Given the vaccines’ reactogenicity, it’s hard to imagine participants and investigators could not make educated guesses about which group they were in."
5065,The primary endpoint in the trials is relatively subjective making unblinding an important concern.
5066,"Yet neither FDA nor the companies seem to have formally probed the reliability of the blinding procedure, and its effects on the reported outcomes."
5067,&gt; Nor do we know enough about the processes of the primary event adjudication committees that counted covid-19 cases.
5068,Were they blinded to antibody data and information on patients’ symptoms in the first week after vaccination?
5069,"What criteria did they employ, and why, with a primary event consisting of a patient-reported outcome (covid-19 symptoms) and PCR test result, was such a committee even necessary?"
5070,It’s also important to understand who was on these committees.
5071,While Moderna has named its four-member adjudication committee—all university-affiliated physicians—**Pfizer’s protocol says three Pfizer employees did the work.
5072,"Yes, Pfizer staff members**."""
5073,#####Vaccine efficacy in people who already had covid?
5074,&gt; Individuals with a known history of SARS-CoV-2 infection or previous diagnosis of Covid-19 were excluded from Moderna’s and Pfizer’s trials.
5075,"But still 1125 (3.0%) and 675 (2.2%) of participants in Pfizer’s and Moderna’s trials, respectively, were deemed to be positive for SARS-CoV-2 at baseline."
5076,"&gt; Vaccine safety and efficacy in these recipients has not received much attention, but as increasingly large portions of many countries’ populations may be “post-Covid,” these data seem important—and all the more so as the US CDC recommends offering vaccine “regardless of history of prior symptomatic or asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection.” This follows on from the agency’s conclusions, regarding Pfizer’s vaccine, that it had ≥92% efficacy and “no specific safety concerns” in people with previous SARS-CoV-2 infection."
5077,"&gt; By my count, Pfizer apparently reported 8 cases of confirmed, symptomatic Covid-19 in people positive for SARS-CoV-2 at baseline (1 in the vaccine group, 7 in the placebo group, using the differences between Tables 9 and 10) and Moderna, 1 case (placebo group; Table 12)."
5078,"&gt; But with only around four to 31 reinfections documented globally, how, in trials of tens of thousands, with median follow-up of two months, could there be nine confirmed covid-19 cases among those with SARS-CoV-2 infection at baseline?"
5079,"Is this representative of meaningful vaccine efficacy, as CDC seems to have endorsed?"
5080,"Or could it be something else, like prevention of covid-19 symptoms, possibly by the vaccine or by the use of medicines which suppress symptoms, and nothing to do with reinfection?"
5081,"**We need the raw data**

&gt; Addressing the many open questions about these trials requires access to the raw trial data."

5104,"Given how well protected of a job teaching is with union benefits, I would recommend the same tactic for any one else that does not feel safe returning in person until the vaccine is available."
5105,They should sold the vaccine since the beginning since the ones who wanted to be vaccinated would go first

5153,Some patients in critical condition (without covid) require only a day or two.
5154,Saving a covid patient thus consumes a lot more time that could be used saving people with lesser conditions.

5229,"So people got it, but got sick and isolated/died before they could spread it."

5299,"We can let the police do the job of investigating, naming and shaming."
5300,Tell them to send video evidence and we'll believe you.
5301,WTF
5302,yeah but you only need to vaccinate the people that go to hospital which isnt the entire country.
5303,it will not change that fast... it is absolute chaos at operative level :-( but France is doing even worse :-P
5304,Would lawsuits be appropriate here?
5305,If it's on Facebook it must be true.
5306,"I expect the highest standard of journalistic integrity, scientific discourse and rational thought on my news feed."
5307,"I think with Vietnam I believe the results of course, but they are unfortunately maybe caught up in the accusations that face similarly located countries who obscure test numbers and then when they do test they find like 20%+ positive cases."
5308,Thailand is facing an outbreak right now.
5309,They also locked down (though a little later than Vietnam).
5310,"They saw great success, but they have no testing infrastructure."
5311,"I believe they have had things under control, but now that there is an outbreak people don't trust the numbers because they barely test anyone."
5312,"They recently screened 3,800 workers proactively and found 900 cases in one day, which were to then be added on top of the daily figure of 350 or so that were caught through normal testing."
5313,"When that happens, people assume it is a lot more rampant than reported (but clearly not so bad as to overwhelm hospitals)."
5314,Anecdotally I also heard from Thai family reports of doctors being told to reclassify some deaths as non-Covid related at the beginning of the pandemic.
5315,"Of course the above isn't relevant to Vietnam, but it explains why people who don't distinguish between Southeast Asian nations may be caught in that thought process and underlying distrust."

5331,"Covaxin is about to be rolled out onto a younger age group, some of the other vaccines aren't tested on people under 18 and Covaxin is about to be administered to 12 year olds."
5332,It's also easier to store as it can be kept in a refrigerator instead of a special freezer.
5333,It's a classic vaccine that injects the dead virus like most typical vaccines so it's different than the Pfizer and Moderna mRNA type.
5334,The makers of Covaxin says this will make it effective against any variation or mutation of the virus.
5335,We don't have hard data on the exact effectiveness of the drug as they're in phase 3 now/rolling out emergency use in India.
5336,They think this is going to give them a lot of data in March.
5337,&gt; Which strain is it that seems to be hitting younger people harder?
5338,None of them.
5339,There’s really no proof or scientific evidence saying this.
5340,Sequencing will tell us more but s dropout is pretty good.
5341,A dropout would indicate either the UK or the SA variant I believe?
5342,At the very least we know the upper bound of uk variant since it should always return s dropout result.
5343,"And it's .5 not 5... yeah I know, hard to believe given what a big deal has been made about the variant."

5347,Yeah that's not suspicious at all...
5348,"Yep, and additionally, the DOL took 2 months to investigate my employer for not following the FFCRA."

5361,The huge virus pool in the USA is concerning.

5368,Its pretty standard to refer to those ruling a country as either the name of the country or the name of the countrys capital.
5369,Given the context its not hard to understand what is meant.
5370,It's not really quite clear how effective they are.
5371,Mainly because they work better if they are given early in the course of disease.
5372,But they also are very expensive and need to be given by IV infusion.
5373,"By the time most people are hospitalized, it's already too late for the monoclonal antibodies to have much effect."
5374,"But rich people under the best of medical care receive the Regeneron treatment early, I suppose."
5375,Just read an article on BBC that WHO scientists denied entry into China and I unable to post the link!
5376,I know this goes against the grain.
5377,But this is a good thing if more people knew about it.
5378,If the rich and powerful are going the shady route to get the vaccine than it must be safe.
5379,A large portion of the most vulnerable are waiting it out because they aren’t convinced that it’s safe to take it.
5380,News like this might change a few minds.
5381,If you need attention this badly you could try being pleasant and likeable instead of deeply boring and stupid.
5382,"But whatever works, I guess."

5438,Most of the deaths that get reported every day for us are from 2-3 weeks prior.
5439,We’re going to have a really ugly Jan and Feb.
5440,Probably because the hospitals are out of money and are themselves on the edge of financial ruin at this point.

5545,It doesn't work.
5546,Let's look at this another way.
5547,Turkey has commited a number of Genocides (an example would be Pontos for my country) and they have been called out numerous times.
5548,Is that a push of lies to defame the country or is it actual historical facts which needs and will always be adressed?

5604,And so many people still think that Jacinda did a horrible job and that she closed the borders far too late and the economy is apparently tanking?
5605,Like wtf.
5606,Sure price of livings gone up again in the South Island but that was always going to happen
5607,New zealand practices xenophobic border lockdowns and travel restrictions.

5618,"Some basic logic for you:

-A makes B easier;

-this doesn't mean that, in the absence of A, B becomes impossible."
5619,"Also, when it comes to covid and disease spread in general, what really matters is not necessarily geographical isolation in the sense of being an actual island."
5620,What matters is being able to functionally isolate yourself.
5621,"Then being an island, and especially a remote one like New Zealand, is absolutely an extra advantage."
5622,I’ve been thinking the same thing but not necessarily that the rich are behind it.
5623,The govt should have deferred bills and made everyone stay home for a few months and we would have been way better off.
5624,"My thought is since social security is running out of money and covid is killing off large percentages of the old folks, they don’t care because it just kicks the can down the road a little further til SS is out of money."

5626,Because they're young and healthy?

5638,How can you have a vaccine passport entry system when vaccines aren’t yet available to all?
5639,"Agreed, and with thoughts to add."
5640,&gt; I think our government is totally flawed and outdated and there has to be a better way to run this country.
5641,This man should never have been elected president in the first place.
5642,"That said, he's being democratically removed from power."
5643,"I'm all for updating governments, it's not as if non-US governments lack problems, but if a President and his foreign influencers will stop at nothing to keep him in power and they're unable to get a 2nd term then democracy in the US is not broken."
5644,"Posters like /u/peppermint-kiss are also remiss (or karma whores, or perhaps just plain ignorant) to dismiss the steps the US has been taking to update and improve government."
5645,"Examples of that would be districting laws to address gerrymandering, various changes to improve voter registration and access."
5646,"A big part of that last one is the extremely widespread mail-in ballot processing that has, in many cases, been put into permanent law."
5647,"None of that supports his ""incredibly broken"" rhetoric."
5648,"If you want to pick an issue that US problems all go back to, including this Covid wildfire that's killing almost as badly as rates in the UK and Italy, then the social policies producing the US Gini coefficient would be an example of a far more appropriate target."
5649,"The ""one man"" in question has certain promoted damage to this, but he didn't start the fire."
5650,"I'd certainly hold his feet to the fire on Covid, but when one steps back and looks at what's happening around the globe it's plainly obvious that freer societies have fewer mitigation options."
5651,It was going to go badly for the US no matter who was in charge because of all the things that normally benefit the US such as free travel between hundreds of millions of people.
5652,"""One man"" could have used responded much more effectively, but this rhetoric about the US system being broken has been objectively falsified."
5653,Your tyrants aren't any better.
5654,Do you have anything to say about the ongoing coronavirus pandemic or are you just whining about the media?
5655,Essential workers are getting it from their job.
5656,A lot of people don’t have the luxury of sheltering at home.

5658,Taiwan is the gold standard for pandemic.
5659,approach here.
5660,Their previous experience with SARS meant they weren’t going to make same mistake twice!
5661,I’m a doc and got vaccinated 2 weeks ago.
5662,Had to wait with a large group for 15 min observation after the shot.
5663,"Vietnam

5664,If you're really so great why not apply for a job?
5665,You don't have to wait in that case
5666,"Oh, I understand that."
5667,"China is physically a huge country, and they contained it with a hard lockdown in one area."
5668,"Eh, I'd say ""everyone over 70"" is going to be easier than health care professionals who are quite busy right now."
5669,Or Nursing homes which require dedicated personnel to go on site.
5670,"During the final phases, it will be considerably easier to get shots in arms when your only concern is that you can schedule them for their follow-up and not making sure they are a particular profession."
5671,The rich are going to get it anyway.
5672,It will change nothing in that regard.
5673,"If you don't see a problem with this, you are part of the problem."
5674,You don’t think they have a vested interest in jiggling the handle on this story as long as possible as it circles the drain?
5675,Why?
5676,‘...so the humidity drops...’ is a bit misleading and ambiguous.
5677,"There is relative humidity measured or indicated as a percent, and absolute humidity which is given in g/m^3 (grams per cubic meter)."
5678,"You are correct in stating that the colder air can hold less water vapor, ie the absolute humidity is lower."
5679,"However the relative humidity is measure of how much water vapor is in the air, at the current temperature, compared to its saturation value."
5680,The relative humidity can and will be anything in winter or summer.
5681,"Why layman think of less humid air, relative humidity that is, in winter is because even fully saturated cold air, when warmed to indoor temperatures will produce an indoor relative humidity that is in the 20-40% depending on the climate."
5682,"In regards to weather events, heavy snowfalls are generally associated with warm relatively moist air masses mixing with colder polar air."
5683,Cold air masses simply can’t hold enough water vapor (absolute humidity) to produce significant snowfall.
5684,"See context of your article ""at the current pace""

What makes you think that the shitty pace won't ever improve?"
5685,We aren’t in full lockdown what are you talking about?
5686,!
5687,Of course it has.
5688,People want to know what's going on.
5689,Is this surprising?
5690,"It wouldn't be ""unending"" with more competence in response."
5691,That doesn't mean what's being reported is sensational.
5692,How many vulnerable people die in the meantime while waiting to make sure those who are willing to pay have access to the shot?
5693,This is a vaccine that some people need a lot more than other people.
5694,"30% of American deaths occur in only
[1.6% of the population."

5708,"Stay mad, lol"
5709,"I agree that it’s widespread already, but with Covid rampant in my area  (suburban Pittsburgh) all the deniers are swearing that it must be this new strain, when to me it just seems like the same consequences you would have seen with the way we are acting with any strain if our summer was actually winter."
5710,People are shocked that at a get together one person can spread it to 8.
5711,These are the same people who rejected my virtually identical stories reported by my friends back in NY in March.

5715,You misspoke.
5716,"It should be “take the vaccine, don’t get Covid.”  
You can still contract the coronavirus that causes it."
5717,This is a terrible idea.
5718,"Once the vaccine is available to everybody, people should just be allowed to take the risk of catching the virus if they choose not to get the vaccine."
5719,"Googled it, and shit you are right."
5720,Very different.
5721,"The problem at the moment in many EU countries is not vaccine numbers, it's getting them out there."
5722,"Netherlands has done zero, France about 500 and Greece has logistical capacity to do 5000 a day."
5723,It doesn't matter if they have one vaccine or 50 vaccines unless they sort their shit out
5724,This is the shopping death wave.
5725,"And yet, it recorded next to no excess mortality save for a very moderate spike in late December which was lower than some past seasonal flu spikes."
5726,"Which probably means that either the restrictions prevented some non-covid deaths, or that some of the covid victims would have likely died from other causes in 2020 anyway."
5727,"&gt; who can administer vaccines now

I'd take junkies at this point."

5756,the 1918 flu pandemic which primarily affected people at war who were the young?
5757,ah i see you're comparing oranges to apples.
5758,"but i guess if we had a war which sent the world's young to the frontline where infection runs rampant, then you would be absolutely correct

read up on the 1918 flu pandemic and WHY it was so deadly to those under 65. it's not like people over 65 were spared, they got sick and some died too."
5759,"That will happen if the vaccines run out, there will be chaos."
5760,I think that's why some hospitals are holding them and not vaccinating as quickly but that's just my guess.
5761,"I would like to mention that the EMA can fuck themselves, I am also sure that they will move the approval date forward like with Biontech and Moderna."

5763,“Stance detection system”?

5798,If I told you I have a doctorate from one of the group of 8 it would likely mean nothing to you?

5800,Why would you expect a purely American concept and experience to mean anything in NZ?
5801,The concept of having elite universities is redundant in NZ.
5802,"Sure some universities might be perceived as being ""better"" for a particular major and not all universities offer the same thing but on the whole similar degrees from different universities are pretty much regarded the same."
5803,So I would expect that having a degree from Harvard would not be perceived as being any better than a degree from any other university (other than perhaps the novelty of how Harvard is perceived by non Americans through the consumption of American media making the person stand out a bit more).

There are 331m people in the US, so only 240m actually need the vaccine."

6034,"&gt;Ok so you are saying that there is a possibility that people taking the vaccine are getting an immune response that is enough to eliminate symptoms, which is the only thing the studies look at, but still leave some amount of the virus active?"
6035,I think the larger issue is that we simply don't know what happened to people who remained asymptomatic during the trials since they were not included in those observational data we have access to.
6036,They were not tested.
6037,We don't know whether vaccinations were enough to eliminate symptoms.
6038,"It's entirely plausible that the vaccine did nothing for them, they were going to be asymptomatic regardless, and remained able to spread it."
6039,Any claims other than that are based on speculation rather than observation.
6040,The last part you are paraphrasing is troubling because it's entirely speculative.
6041,"I'm growing tired of Fauci's speculation, unfortunately."
6042,He's a better scientists than his current behavior is showing.
6043,He's allowing panic (and his subsequent desire to quell it) to guide his conversations.
6044,When you say we should expect this vaccine to work like other vaccines in regards to coronaviridae it's  important to note the only coronavirus vaccines I know of that are approved for humans would involve flu vaccines and those operate the way I'm pointing out--they don't confer full immunity nor do they prevent transmission.
6045,If you think this vaccine will work like those the conclusion you'd reach is the same as mine--we should not expect full immunity and elimination of transmission.
6046,"I work in public health emergency response, and here’s a few reasons why we didn’t call on the national guard again for assistance with community testing after the first time: cost, they used more PPE due to their regulations, they wouldn’t/couldn’t do certain tasks, they’re not trained to record patient information, etc."
6047,If you’re interested I can totally go into more detail about how these issues make the national guard an unrealistic choice and challenges to conventional staffing.
6048,It’s a more complex topic than many people expect.
6049,No.

6051,You may have misunderstood.
6052,I’m not talking about how severe and deadly that is competed to this - I’m talking about the sheer number of people we have moving around compared to any other time in history.
6053,And *which* countries record deaths in lakhs?
6054,"As opposed to in wan, myriad, or crore?"
6055,It’s INSANE to me that people were advocating that young “essential” (non-medical) workers get vaccinated before the elderly because essential workers are disproportionately minorities.

6210,"I’ve read about many who cannot work any longer, and they have kids to take care of."
6211,It’s so sad.
6212,Please take care of yourself.
6213,Wishing you the absolute best.
6214,"Ok so you are saying that there is a possibility that people taking the vaccine are getting an immune response that is enough to eliminate symptoms, which is the only thing the studies look at, but still leave some amount of the virus active?"
6215,This is possible/plausible I guess but goes against what we know about how vaccines work.
6216,mRNA is a different way of stimulating/educating the immune system but the immune system is still how it works.
6217,If you look at the comments from Fauci and others that I linked it is clear that the only way that they think the virus can be transmitted after vaccination/immunization is if it is somehow present in the body but not being attacked by the immune system.
6218,Covid is a new virus but is a coronavirus and is not completely unknown.
6219,Response to vaccine similar to other coronaviruses is a reasonable assumption.
6220,Is this different than the UK strain from a week or two ago?
6221,Religion is the main reason people are so uneducated.
6222,"If everyone you know tells you fake stories and forcibly indoctrinates you from a young age, you're bound to believe that over facts based entirely in evidence."
6223,"Some are able to believe in fake people from thousands of years ago while still understanding science, but those are few and far between compared to the masses of zealots."
6224,The head of Operation Warp Speed expects the AstraZeneca vaccine to be approved in April in the US.
6225,wtf kinda logic is this??
6226,it absolutely does fucking matter.
6227,jesus.
6228,tell that to the vulnerable people not vaccinated right now who are going to die in the coming months from covid.
6229,The worse part of it all is that I don’t think this is the eye of this storm yet.
6230,"I think we will see a few more days of 50-60,000 cases for the next week."
6231,Which will be an untenable position to be in.
6232,Imagine living under the biggest rock...

6237,"We can't even store the material properly, let alone allocate it."
6238,It's going to be a very long while before mass immunization starts.
6239,I don't know better than the experts.
6240,"Therefore, I read the primary source material of the vaccine trials themselves, listen to statements from the reviewers of those submitted journal articles, and read statements from voting members of the FDA who approved the vaccine for emergency use."
6241,"I don't interact on social media and no, I won't pay more attention to posts on social media when I have the benefit of speaking to experts directly...some of whom I share a voting position with on my university's IRB."
6242,Whether I understand this as well as I think is irrelevant to the fact that I definitely understand it better than you think I do.

6284,"Pfizer is probably way more effective than 52% after one dose since that number includes people who were infected within a few days of getting the first vaccine, in which case getting the second dose is irrelevant."

&gt; Senior officials working with the White House coronavirus task force and Operation Warp Speed are pushing for states to begin handing out some of their excess COVID-19 vaccine doses to whoever wants it, according to four individuals familiar with the matter."
6363,"&gt; The plan is already in motion, with federal officials already talking to states about it."
6364,"If further enacted, the shift in distribution could upend months of debate and strategizing about who should get the vaccine first."
6365,"But officials argue that this first-come, first-served approach may be one of the only ways to ensure that millions of vaccine doses don’t expire on the shelf."

6549,"Yes, each side tries to get a a jury favorable to their side."
6550,This is supported by the law because each side is given preemptory strikes (not just strikes for cause).

6573,Imagine both of your parents have comorbidities.
6574,"You could vaccinate one now and reserve the second dose for that one, while the other one doesn't get it."
6575,Or you could vaccinate both now with your two doses.
6576,Which do you choose?
6577,"I know a lot of people have strong feelings one way or another to this but this is already done and how paramedics handle cardiac arrest, there is no improved outcome from transporting a pt who is in aystole, it is just dangerous to the crew."

And before someone points to higher thanksgiving numbers: the death rate increase was the same rate of change increase pre thanksgiving

6602,"In addition, as we've seen, new variants of COVID emerge in various parts of the world, versus the norm with the flu is for there to be emergent strains in Eastern Asia on which western countries base their vaccines."
6603,"In addition, because the R0 of COVID-19 is so much higher, *many* more vaccines need to be distributed to the population in order to curtail each variant/strain that escapes."
6604,"judges have actually started limiting the amount of challenges you get, which limits the amount of people that need to be in a panel for jury selection, but i dont think they can outright change the amount of jurors you get, as that is generally codified in state laws and not a procedural thing."

Today's (Jan 5th) vaccination update:

In the U.S we vaccinated over 500k people for a total of 5.05 million people out of 17.0million distributed

Worldwide 15,000,000 doses were given since the beginning

6851,That’s 320 days to vaccinate the entire population.
6852,"Not to mention a large percentage don’t want to to take the vaccine, and also don’t you have to take two dosages with a 7-10 day gap?I know we only need 70% population immunity."

6867,"I think the people arguing about ""scientific proof"" is either politically motivated or straight out dumb."
6868,It doesn't take much brain to know masks block droplets at minimum.
6869,"Then 1% protection is better than no protection, how's mask dangerous is it's not 100%."
6870,The controversies on masks in the West is crazy in this day and age.
6871,Too much personal freedom made too many idiots
6872,So you want them to sleep on the fucking street or something?
6873,what are you talking about?
6874,There are still many steel mills here.
6875,"I just did a quick google on ""jury duty California COVID"" and the first page of results had San Bernadino, San Francisco, Sacramento, Orange, and Riverside counties all stating that jury service was mandatory and they have COVID precautions in place."
6876,"However, I'm skeptical as to the value of mitigations."
6877,"Most criminal court buildings are old and have aging or retrofitted HVAC, and fresh airflow is the most important mitigation technique."
6878,Sanitization is basically theater.
6879,"&gt; Trust me, stay the fuck at home."
6880,This just isn't realistic advice for many people.
6881,"They need to work in order to have insurance, pay their rent, buy food, etc."
6882,Not everyone has the luxury of working from home.
6883,It's the act surprised part coupled with asking to implement policies that would make domestic production even more expensive that boggles mine.
6884,"Unpopular opinion; we may think we're on higher ground by not domestically allowing the kind of abhorrent cheap labor situations China allows, but all it means is the situation exists anyway somewhere else, and with it goes leverage too."
6885,"I hate it, but since the abhorrent working conditions are going to happen anyway, we were better off when they were local and we were more self sufficient."
6886,Unfortunately this also leads to an argument for imperialism where we just conquer the barbarians and civilize the world for their own good.
6887,"Pip pip, cheerio."
6888,I just find the lack of ability to actually function inexplicable.
6889,I'm not blaming you.
6890,I'm just noting that the government ORDERED all these adjustments.
6891,We have complied.

6909,I thought I had it last year in January but obviously in the US there were no tests yet.

6927,"I said ***Russia*** uses civil law, not common law like the United States (and most other countries which have heritage with Britain)."

6933,"Well, COVID was reported to the WHO on December 31 and a lot of the world still chose to do nothing about the information."
6934,"Unlike a lot of places in the world, China was also willing to do what it took to get the outbreak under control."
6935,China built 2 hospitals that added 2200 beds in Wuhan and locked down the city very early in.
6936,The rest of the world saw this happen.
6937,"There is no excuse for saying ""we didn't know how bad it was."""
6938,"Now, there is certainly some suspicious stuff going on, such as China refusing to let the WHO go in and investigate the origin of the virus, but to say that the rest of the world was left in the dark until it was too late is just false."
6939,They’ll help reduce our Covid rate!
6940,If this is true...just wow!
6941,"So irresponsible, immoral, and possibly criminal"
6942,This isn't entirely true unfortunately.
6943,The Pfizer vaccine is a two dose vaccine.
6944,My understanding is that the recipient must take the second dose no sooner than 21 days after the first dose.
6945,The numbers aren't in yet about the efficacy of a single dose of the Pfizer vaccine in conferring immunity.
6946,We are on the long haul.
6947,"lol what's up texas, who hurt you?"
6948,"W had his issues, but I think he would have at least tried to have fought against Covid."
6949,Or at least not actively promoted the spread.
6950,Filled hospitals?
6951,They were empty according to that shitty youtube video!
6952,Seriously this is fucked up.
6953,We dont have the resources or the money to deal with this shit because our “leaders” would rather watch us all die instead of taxing the rich to fund the healthcare and systems every other first world country has.
6954,They should.
6955,I don't think the spike protein they're targeting with the vaccine is changing that much.
6956,This is a topic I have been pondering for a while.
6957,I don't wish to break Reddit's rules and hope the comment/question I ask does not do that!
6958,The question of the origin of the Virus is clearly something the WHO would like to investigate.
6959,The two choices that have been continually quoted in the world press are that it either originated from the Wet Markets (animals) or that it was manufactured in a laboratory.
6960,"Even if the answer is the latter, this does not mean it was released intentionally."
6961,That is a question that only needs to be investigated if the authorities are confident that it was man-made in a laboratory.
6962,Let's say the WHO's investigation concluded the virus originated from a laboratory.
6963,"Whether it was released accidentally or otherwise, **my question is this."
6964,"**

What would/could the ""world"" do as a result that would,

1."
6965,"Provide sufficient satisfaction to those countries that have been affected, and
2."
6966,Limit the likelihood of this ever happening again?
6967,"If a powerful nation chose to go down this path again, I suspect the answer to both questions would be **NOTHING!"

6969,Once vaccinated can you go out and eat inside a restaurant?
6970,"I’ve been pondering on this all day, and I wish I knew the efficacy numbers: what percentage of the transported patients would have survived?"
6971,20%?
6972,5%?
6973,"Because that’s 20 people, or 5, who wouldn’t have died in normal times, but they’re going to now."
6974,Saving their lives is a luxury we no longer have.
6975,Now we have to run the numbers.
6976,Now we have to do the math.
6977,"Now we have to say, “there’s a thing we could try, but we’re booked solid, and while you need to roll a nat 20, this guy over here only needs a 14, so…I gotta let him roll instead.”"

6984,FREEDUMB.
6985,Yes.
6986,That’s why you need evidence and that evidence needs to be valid.
6987,What other implications are possible with a change in the spike protein like this?
6988,How much could it change the way this virus interacts with human cells?
6989,"Based on my own observations the last 10 months, it appears deaths are spiking in South Africa at an alarming rate compared to the timing of their current surge in new cases."
6990,I know this strain was just discovered in December.
6991,Do we even have any observations of any altered behavior In Vitro yet?
6992,The Texas Supreme Court suspended in person jury trials.
6993,They’ve extended that order several times.
6994,Several counties worked on transitioning to zoom jury trials.
6995,"It’s harder than it sounds, you have to make sure people have technology, that they’re online, it hasn’t frozen, etc."
6996,"Plus, you can’t have a full panel of jurors on screen (@35 people depending on the size of the panel) so they have to break up voir dire."
6997,Some counties tried other things like putting trials in larger rooms with distance.
6998,"Smaller counties have done less, but they have less resources too and are more skeptical about the virus."
6999,"I had a trial in a small county and the court said it was advised to wear a mask— not required, advised."
7000,"The judges have plexiglass around their bench, but that doesn’t help the lawyers sitting next to a client."

7021,"They claim that the rates among teachers is ""casting doubt on the government's repeated assertion that teachers are at no greater risk than other workers"" but then compare to general populace...

Why not apples to apples and compare to other essential workers?"
7022,A person is fully vaccinated once they receive the required shots.
7023,Fully protected (or maximum protection) happens at a later date.
7024,Those are re-education camps.

7030,"I don’t mind journalists calling this shit out right now, but we do not want cuomo style threats of huge fines if somehow certain vaccines get distributed in the wrong order."
7031,Hospitals will then start holding up vaccines and make sure their ass is 100% covered before doing any shots.
7032,"WHO has lots of faith in China, but the return ?"
7033,I’m making fun of how some Americans make fun of this places yet they are handling this crisis better and citizens are taking seriously.
7034,And...teaches!
7035,"I just looked it up those things are 16 inches tall, and 5 inches in diameter...thats like a human thigh of oxygen every 19 minutes...fuck."
7036,The kinda machinery that can generate that to an entire hospital must be insane.
7037,...and if the machine breaks like that one in indua...good lord
7038,Taiwan absolutely doesn’t.

7057,"You don't want life to be normal ever again, because your sad and pitiable, having lived your entire life being an abject social failure, unable to build interpersonal bridges."
7058,"So, salty and bitter that others enjoy life, hugging, partying, eating at restaurants, shopping, etc., you jump at the opportunity to belittle them, and act as if they'll have to live like you forever: Staring at a while, waiting to die."
7059,"And so you, in contradiction of all medical science and epidemiology, claim that it will last years so that you can quell the wailing, nasally voice bubbling inside of you saying ""One day, you will need to participate in society."""
7060,Well there you have it.
7061,And I'm the one being downvoted.
7062,wow.
7063,Why not just grab people off the damn street and get them vaccinated i wonder?
7064,Visitors and outpatient patients?
7065,"Form a line, get it done."
7066,US deaths are now more than those 2 combined (350k) and are going to be 500k within the next 2 months.
7067,"Worldwide deaths are also close to 2m, the same as both of those combined."
7068,And we arent anywhere near close to being done with this.
7069,"So yeah, this IS a once in a lifetime thing."
7070,Presumably he feels that won’t be sufficient.
7071,He doesn’t address vaccinations in the article that was linked.
7072,That wouldn't fly here.
7073,"The last time I was called (two years ago) to appear for a summons, a guy tried everything he possibly could to weasel out of it and the judge put him through the ringer."

7079,Remember when Trump said he would give $10k to the UPS guy who stopped those kids from burning the flag?

7106,And?
7107,Why not strive for that goal?
7108,With vaccines rolling out and proper protections in place it makes sense.
7109,well looks like we are getting the former since the lattet is going slow as mud
7110,We have an excess of vaccine at our hospital because even within our hospital workers there is reluctance because of the BULLSHIT they are reading online.
7111,There should be a tax credit for taking the vaccine.
7112,This is what happens when governments the world over claim masks don't work for months on end.
7113,Sometimes it can be hard to reverse those lies.
7114,"I've heard the claims about shortages being the cause, however that's not what was claimed and it greatly influenced how many thought about masks and their effectiveness."

7473,There was a thread where Fauci said he expects everything to be mostly back to normal by Fall and people were just straight up saying he was being way too optimistic and that life would continue like this well into 2022

7501,Also a lot of states that like to update at random times in the day
7502,I'm in Ukiah too and agree with you.
7503,Small towns have a way of getting stuff done with less and that's what I saw happening here.
7504,The biggest takeaway is that maybe we need to reconsider the tier system and just start vaccinating all people who want it and go from there.

ANTI-MASK PROTESTERS TRY TO FORCE WAY INTO STORES AT CENTURY CITY MALL   
By Josh Haskell    
Monday, January 4, 2021 5:50PM PT

CENTURY CITY (KABC) -- Shoppers and employees at the Century City mall on Sunday became the target of anti-mask protesters who forcefully spread their message to anyone wearing a mask -- which was everyone at the mall because masks are required."
7547,"""We see the protesters with the megaphones saying no masks."
7548,Take off the masks.
7549,"Open back up L.A. All lives matter,"" said Johnathan Cabrera who works at Century City Mall

Cabrera works at the store Untuckit and locked the doors to prevent protesters from coming inside, then closed his store early."
7550,Cabrera says he was shocked by the group of about 30 and says he's rarely had issues with anti-maskers before.
7551,"""I've had a few guests come in that say 'I really don't want to wear this,' but we always encourage them for your safety, our safety, please wear your mask when you're shopping in our store,"" said Cabrera."
7552,"""They want to spread awareness of their message which is that masks, they say that masks are ineffective and COVID is part of a broader conspiracy."
7553,"Obviously, the overwhelming scientific consensus contradicts that,"" said Samuel Braslow with Beverly Hills Courier."
7554,"Braslow, a reporter with the Beverly Hills Courier, covered the protest and says this group has been targeting Los Angeles stores the past few weeks, including chain super markets and pharmacies."
7555,"The LAPD was called to the mall, but some eyewitnesses tell us they were surprised the protesters weren't asked to leave or cited."
7556,"The LAPD tells ABC7 their role on Sunday at the mall was just like any other protest: facilitate first amendment rights, keep the peace, and not intervene unless necessary."
7557,It's almost as though both countries fucked up.
7558,That's what I'm pointing out.
7559,Thats simple.
7560,Same reason as everything.
7561,Money.
7562,You know it is really expensive to have that skiing lodge in Aspen and a number of houses spread across the country for you and all your friends right?
7563,"I mean, people in power will cater society to theirs and their closest personal needs."
7564,"It's just how everything has formed over the last 40 years or so with ultra capitalism, self-entitlement, and valuing objects higher then human lives."
7565,Moneyy unfortunately does that to people.
7566,Especially ones that stay in power the longest.
7567,They often get quite desensitized.

7569,Not everyone hates high school
7570,That's what happens when people can't afford to miss a paycheck
7571,I'm not pro China.
7572,I'm pointing out that your description matches the US.
7573,"I'm against the CCP's practices, and so if the US is doing those same things, I'll call it out to."
7574,May I ask why you assumed that I'm pro China?
7575,[deleted]
7576,"True, but it's not really fully on the state government."
7577,It's the responsibility of the federal government from the very top on down.
7578,"A consistent nation-wide response is the only way to effectively respond to a national, nation-wide crisis."
7579,[deleted]
7580,"The fact the post praises quarantines and testing, and somehow forgets to mention the most important measure, travel bans, tells you they're not trying to inform, they're trying to influence."
7581,I assume that the healthcare workers know their stuff like engineerings know our.
7582,If a Boeing engineer refuses to fly you know something is wrong.
7583,I'm in Ukiah too!
7584,Found out too late for me and my family but so so grateful the hospital moved forward and didn't let those vaccines go to waste.
7585,"And, glad you were able to get yours started!"
7586,And this is the *sped up* version of their internal process???

7590,"We are reproducing at a much higher rate than covid kills, or even will kill in a more deadly scenario."
7591,Especially worldwide.

7613,"News media misreported this, because they apparently can't read."
7614,(And he wasn't *too* far off- about 14 million were distributed in Dec.
7615,Hospitals are just slow to do innoculations...)
7616,The entire extent of Santa Clara’s page on their juror COVID policy is a shitty video of them wiping down surfaces.
7617,"They show the inside of a courtroom where all the attorneys and judge are behind plexiglass, but the jurors are just sitting next to each other as normal, but with one seat empty between them (so 3 feet apart or less)."
7618,Somehow they thought this would make people comfortable to serve?
7619,It’s awful.
7620,could?
7621,it’s a virus...
7622,I didn’t know that.
7623,Antibodies testing isn’t for covid-19 but just coronavirus in general?
7624,That's probably the case for parents who can afford private school or private instruction.
7625,I'd risk my kid (and myself) getting COVID if the alternative was falling behind.
7626,It gives me fits thinking about the chasm of inequity that is being opened through this pandemic.

7677,True.
7678,It's also true that is much easier to build equipment to supply oxygen than to train providers.

7686,They don't separate oxygen from nitrogen everyday but they certainly have people who could figure out how to do that and how to make polygauze and hazard suits and gloves.

- Supplier issues (highly unlikely in this case)
- Transportation issues 
 - Trucks go down, as do the generators powering the refrigerator."
7758,"Now, I know much of this is stored with dry ice, but dry ice lasts longer when it's sealed, and when the ambient air is cooler
 - Parcels/pallets/etc get misloaded, damaged, messed-with in transit."
7759,"A cooler that breaks open will have its CO2 sublimate very quickly, even if the refrigerator outside of it is on
-Dock issues
 - Not sure how these are warehoused between supplier and destination, but you can slap ""HIGH PRIORITY"" and ""KEEP COLD"" and even have temperature and tip indicators on the side of items - people will still occasionally mess this up
 - Receiving points of distribution will mess it up."
7760,"When the truck comes with vaccines, and maybe it's the 4th or 5th shipment, your manager won't be there excited to make sure everything goes right."
7761,Then Jimmy the underpaid worker is in his second week on the job and leaves a pallet/cooler/whatever in the sun before the items can get into the Walgreens special pharmacy freezer.
7762,- Poorly organized points of distribution will mishandle vaccines - this is alarming because it'll leave patients confident that they have immunity while they may not.
7763,"Think of how many offices will not be able to get dry ice easily because of rural-type locations, or their freezers go down."
7764,"Decisions will be made to try to extend the life of these vaccines, and this is where we will find vials stored in breakroom freezers
 - General mishandling including damaged vials and the like

I'm confident that the rollout will continue, and it will be robust and the timelines on when certain groups can START receiving the vaccines will be more or less adhered to, however, make no mistake that once these begin, the rollout might be slower than expected."
7765,"Couple that with the number of antivaxxers who won't get it, and the children who can't yet get it, and add on the people who don't have immune systems that will allow them to get immunity from it (or they're allergic), and the idea that we'll get herd immunity anytime soon becomes less and less probable."

&gt;While no one could have predicted the scope of the COVID-19 pandemic,  J&amp;J had systems in place to grapple with the unprecedented  event—the same crisis strategies, in fact, it leveraged in response to  Hurricane Maria in 2017, Lefebvre said."
7777,"and  

&gt;Elsewhere, J&amp;J is relying on its own sites in Europe to make drug  substance, while Catalent tackles fill-finish duties at its Anagni,  Italy, plant."
7778,"J&amp;J just this week [finalized a deal](https://www.fiercepharma.com/vaccines/j-j-inks-european-covid-19-vaccine-supply-deal-for-200m-doses)  to provide up to 200 million doses to Europe, with the option to sell  another 200 million shots at a later date should the vaccine pass muster  in clinical trials."

Fingers crossed."
7780,As a Canadian it’s always weird to see the words “hospital” and “business” in one sentence
7781,It is a 2 week lockdown.
7782,There is a delay after vaccination before you get immunity and still have to get your 2nd shot.
7783,Probably don't have full immunity until about 6 weeks after the first shot.
7784,"""But kids don't spread the virus!"""
7785,Making it the first airborn virus that doesn't absolutely LOVE kids...
7786,"Seriously, in a normal year schools are flu factories."
7787,I like how the conversation can be about almost anything like economic principles or two specific people and there will usually be a snide redditor that makes that comment.
7788,Either that or it's just you repeating the same thing anytime you think it might be applicable.
7789,You might notice that you were the first one to mention Merica.
7790,"My kids schools do the live streaming the same time they are teaching in person, all work and tests are done via the same online portal for both students."
7791,For middle and high school this works really well and doesn’t force teachers to do two separate plans.
7792,Elementary I know is much more difficult of course.
7793,BUT WHAT IS THE POINT?
7794,If all those things are true - that more people catch it and more people die from it *SO WHAT*.
7795,It doesn't change anything about the approach to the disease.
7796,Whatever.
7797,At least people are actually getting them!
7798,I'm way past the point of caring about the pecking order.
7799,That plan has clearly failed.
7800,Just get vaccines into arms.
7801,"A lot of these ""humans will never hug or shake hands again"" or ""people will never go to a stadium again"" comments are going to look really silly in 12 months."
7802,"Yep, that is exactly what I've encountered as well, except it was at Albertson's."
7803,Yes that puts it in perspective.
7804,Wish we spent less on military overall anyway.
7805,Thanks for the info!
7806,"She did get a fine: ""Other reports have suggested the nurse was fined for ‘not working during hard times’""."
7807,"I am not egyptian, but man fuck the egyptian government."
7808,"&gt; Their schools did a shitty job for the remote learners

Did the schools do a terrible job or did the kids not bother doing any work?"
7809,Because I've seen both.
7810,"I know parents of kids frustrated the teachers aren't giving enough work and doing enough teaching, but I also know parent's whose kids simply aren't doing anything."
7811,"&gt; Um, have you heard of the flu vaccine?"
7812,I knew you would use the flu vaccine as an example.
7813,"My ""Everyone gets the COVID vaccine, except legitimate medical waivers"" public policy only works if COVID does not mutate at a high rate like the flu does."
7814,"If COVID is a slow mutator, then we can eradicate it because the vaccine makers can adapt the vaccine formula as quickly as COVID mutates."
7815,"If COVID is a fast mutator, then we are stuck with the flu vaccine problem."
7816,"In that case, everyone still has to get their COVID booster shots every year, just so we can slow down the COVID mutation rate."
7817,"Honestly, I don't know if COVID is a fast or slow mutator, so I don't know what we will end up with."
7818,"However, I still think that everyone who can take the vaccine should either be forced or through policies and laws, put into as small a societal bubble as possible."
7819,"If single individuals want to risk the health of thousands or millions for their own unscientific personal reasons, then isolate them."
7820,The US has done this before and it should be an option today.
7821,In the long term New Zealand would also have failed if vaccines never showed up.
7822,Bulgaria was just unlucky enought that it took a year.
7823,Would it be safe to use welding-grade oxygen?
7824,There's also a huge rise in testing.
7825,"The heat map for the first wave is biased towards elderly because testing was primarily for those at risk at the time, now everybody can get a test."
7826,"Kind of confirms that they were full of shit with “islamofascism.” 

Terrorists have no need/desire to undermine America now that we’re doing a stellar job ourselves lol."
7827,"&gt;They need to be giving mass vaccinations to people

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;People are dying and California knew the vaccine was coming yet did nothing to prepare."
7828,"you don't appreciate the scope of ""prepare""

NY has just started planning 

the *beginning* 

of the *start* 

of *mass vaccinations*

&amp;#x200B;

3 weeks the vax has been out in the UK."
7829,I suspect they're still collecting names of the volunteers.
7830,and gathering the materials they're going to need.
7831,"(UK is roughly 2x the size of CA)

&amp;#x200B;

do you legitimately think 3 weeks is enough time to train tens of thousands of volunteers and convert convention centers and stadiums to mass vax venues?"
7832,"&amp;#x200B;

that's simply **unrealistic**."
7833,"&amp;#x200B;

Giants, Lakers, Clippers, A's, Dodgers, Angels, Sharks, Ducks, 9ers, Rams, Chargers parks ?"
7834,in 3 weeks?
7835,"&amp;#x200B;

**Covid vaccine: How will the UK jab millions of people?"
7836,"**

[https://www.bbc.com/news/health-55274833](https://www.bbc.com/news/health-55274833)

The NHS is recruiting **30,000 volunteers to help with the rollout, including lifeguards, airline staff and students - who will be trained to give the jabs."
7837,** The charity St John Ambulance has been asked to assist.
7838,"The military have also been enlisted, to help with logistics and building mass vaccination centres."
7839,"Armed forces have already been assisting in the set up of a mass vaccination centres, such as those at ***Ashton Gate stadium in Bristol."
7840,"Other sites are also being prepared, for example Leicester and Epsom racecourses, the Bath &amp; West Showground and the Etihad Campus in Manchester."
7841,"***

&amp;#x200B;

CDC has all the same venues under consideration

**Guidance for Planning Vaccination Clinics Held at Satellite, Temporary, or Off-Site Locations**

[https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/hcp/admin/mass-clinic-activities/index.html](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/hcp/admin/mass-clinic-activities/index.html)

&gt;The purpose of this guidance is to assist with jurisdictional planning and implementation of satellite, temporary, or off-site vaccination clinics by public and private vaccination organizations."
7842,Other users may include public health preparedness professionals.
7843,"The guidance primarily focuses on clinical considerations for planning a vaccination clinic, including vaccine storage, handling, administration, and documentation."
7844,"However, large-scale clinics, such as those held in arenas or stadiums, those held over multiple days or those conducted during emergency scenarios, will likely require added logistical and technical considerations."
7845,Consult your state or local public health preparedness office for additional support.
7846,"&gt;  
&gt;The guidance applies to clinics that are open to the general public and clinics that are for targeted populations only (i.e., critical workforce personnel and/or higher-risk priority groups)."
7847,"These clinics may be provisionally located at walk-through sites (churches, community centers, outdoor tents) or other settings such as mobile, curbside, or drive-through sites."
7848,"Guidance is applicable whether routine vaccination is provided (i.e., back-to-school or annual flu clinics) or emergency vaccination is provided in a preparedness scenario (i.e., pandemic influenza or COVID-19 vaccination when vaccine is available)."
7849,"As a counter point, almost all therapeutics and vaccines - whether discovered in an academic university lab or in a private lab - are the direct result of government funding."
7850,"It's kind of an odd system that we (taxpayers) fund the research in the first place, we take the hit for the ones that don't work out, and then for the ones that are successful, we have to pay for the final product again."
7851,"Exactly, old Covid is still gonna Covid."
7852,People just convinced themselves it was hype for some reason just because it never got rooted before the weather turned.
7853,Big olive oil always working behind the scenes smh
7854,So then the priority groups are not solving a problem and are instead creating a different problem.
7855,I would describe that as priority groups not working.
7856,I too am optimistic and am a little confused by all of the people that are wallowing in the bad news to the point that they deny the existence of good news and down vote anyone that dares to buck the trend.
7857,80% of fatalities are in 15% of the population and a significant % of the population has already been exposed.
7858,We don't need 300 million vaccinations to make a big difference probably more like 25-30 million.
7859,I think the curves will start to drop pretty soon in a few weeks.
7860,[removed]
7861,We won't need it next time as we'll have the infrastructure to quickly make a few billion doses of mRNA vaccines.
7862,I live in NJ and I concur.
7863,"I'm not a Republican either, I voted for Biden, wanted Warren, and am thrilled about Georgia."
7864,None of this changes the fact that Cuomo is often completely full of shit and a lot of bluster.
7865,New York City's campaign regarding testing strikes me as insane - get tested.
7866,Get tested often.
7867,Get tested whether you feel anything or not.
7868,"They are literally encouraging ""getting tested regularly""."
7869,Really?
7870,"If you don't feel sick and know you haven't been near someone infected because you're mostly locked down, wearing a mask for brief grocery trips, etc."
7871,Keep getting in line with thousands of strangers once a week and potentially spending hours within a few feet of them?
7872,"I'll take my chances on staying home and NOT getting tested regularly, since that would seem to be the place where I'm constantly exposing myself for long periods of time to the same strangers."
7873,"And what I mean by ""same strangers"" is that viral load and time spent near someone expelling virus matters."
7874,Passing people on the street who are masked or in the grocery store is not the same as standing on a line for 90 minutes to 2 hours between two people who might actually BE infected.
7875,"Even with a mask, the chances are greater than the other scenarios."
7876,"So testing like 60K/day or more can be accomplished, but administering doses properly cannot be?"
7877,"Yeaaa, i don't really see a big issue here either."
7878,The cost of the vaccine vs the cost of economic damage over a prolonged time is nothing.
7879,Can't get charged if you can't breath.
7880,Went to the store with my husband to do our bi weekly grocery hunt and there was an older fellow walking around Walmart with no mask and glaring at everyone as if he was challenging them to say something?????
7881,Arizona right now is a shit show and only getting worse.
7882,Thats a bit fucked then isn't it?
7883,It's not unconstitutional in Australia.
7884,Californians come over to vacation in Arizona because we have zero restrictions.
7885,"I have several VRBOs in my neighborhood, always full of cars with California plates."
7886,It's probably both.
7887,NZ is 27% immigrant and I haven't heard of any immigrants picking fruit.
7888,You have to be highly skilled or wealthy to immigrate to NZ.
7889,"The fruit pickers are on temporary work visas, mostly backpackers."
7890,That’s exactly my point!
7891,The logistical bottleneck due to the cooling necessity and priorissation of groups is a huge problem.
7892,We need a vaccine which we can distribute through existing infrastructure - family doctors that can be provided to anybody who wants one
7893,Dayyyuummm
7894,"Pretty sure their wording is just trash, they're contextualizing by saying global death toll may compare to the population of LA (\~4mil) when things wind down."
7895,"Given we're at \~1.8mil officially reported deaths give or take currently, it probably is on the somewhat conservative side of estimations."
7896,"&amp;#x200B;

either that or they really are alleging 100% mortality rate is conservative... its hard to tell on the internet sometimes."
7897,Is the target 100 million shots or 100 million people?
7898,I always thought it was 100 million shots.
7899,100 million people is a much better target.
7900,"That seems appropriate, this is the dark winter."
7901,"Beyond March, beyond one full year, is where I think it becomes questionable whether these can really be called temporary measures anymore."
7902,"Mine says ""Access Denied""."
7903,News from Taiwan
7904,I'm unbelievably jealous.
7905,I'm so tired of my country sucking so hard in every important metric of health and human development.
7906,3.
7907,The current vaccines provide immunity comparable to or better than infection.
7908,"More antibodies and a broader immune response compared to infections, without the potential to hurt people."
7909,[removed]
7910,"Ya, I think he's responsible for distributing more doses of HCQ than any other individual."
7911,"&gt;should we worry about devaluing the dollar and/or inflation\

No, the vaccine distribution budget is only 1% of our military budget."
7912,"It's a fair amount of money, but still a tiny drop in the bucket compared to our overall spending - not to mention the ROI will be huge."
7913,Nothing will stimulate the economy like individuals who feel confident to go back out and spend/earn money.
7914,"Yes there are many people that think that damage to the heart, brain and other organs is just a typical and common outcome from Covid."
7915,The headlines report these issues but given no indication about frequency or likelihood or how this is different than other respiratory illnesses or viruses.
7916,And if you dare to even question anyone about it you're downvoted to oblivion.
7917,"I’m sorry, your experience sounds horrible."
7918,My experience as a parent in a California district has been much different.
7919,"Our district has been online since March and has done an amazing job providing computers, materials, etc to the children."
7920,Sadly it’s still not enough for the young children and they’re paying the price.
7921,"That said, the district has put millions into prepping all the schools to return with all the safety supplies, dividers, and gear in place."
7922,They even secured enough funds and are all set to ensure all staff and students receive weekly testing.
7923,Oh and teachers and student can remain online if they prefer.
7924,"Still, with all that, they haven’t been able to open due to politics."
7925,"In reading your response, I think the worst part of this horrible debate that is happening at the staff/children’s expense is that it’s happening on a national level, but schools are functioning on a state and local level."
7926,"I don’t know if the federal government has the power, but maybe Biden’s 100 day plan will force schools like yours to step up their response/safety efforts and schools like mine to open."
7927,"They can't exactly show more certainty in this case, because it's a hypothesis with a strong reasoning that's impossible to verify."
7928,Well almost everyone I know changed theirs.
7929,Most just stayed in their family.
7930,A few had just a small gathering of two or three households rather than large extended family ones.
7931,I'm in BC (Canada) with one of the lowest rates of COVID in North America.
7932,Being disciplined works.
7933,They got a forensics team to swab at the site and couldn't say.
7934,"If I recall right they found fragments, but not any more than would be expected from the known infected person having worked there."
7935,"&gt; Moderna, Pfizer, FDA &amp; WHO all state there's no data

1."
7936,They state there's not enough data on medium-term *efficacy*.
7937,"They made no such statement about ethics and morality of getting more people vaccinated sooner, because they're not ethicists."
7938,They can only comment on what their trial showed.
7939,2.
7940,The statements you're referring to were all about the UK decision to delay a second dose for 12 weeks.
7941,This study looked at delaying only a percentage of doses for a maximum of 6 weeks.
7942,I bet you're using stuff made in China in some capacity right now.
7943,I'd say people seem to be self selecting for their own risk level.
7944,Among my family and friends it seems those in the risk groups especially males 55+ are most likely to be interested.
7945,Young people less so.
7946,My local theater chain was advocating to not wear a mask once seated
7947,My kids school allows both in person and virtual- the teacher teaches both classes at the same time.
7948,All work for both is done via a portal that either student can access (also so teachers don’t have to touch any paperwork).
7949,It’s worked out really really well.
7950,The only reason districts wouldn’t do something similar is that they want to force kids to physically go back.
7951,It’s bullshit.
7952,It's unconstitutional to implement a hard border crossing between NYC and the rest of the country.
7953,Guess the same would apply to all other European countries as well.
7954,"Sure, but for example we had nearly no flu deaths in Germany this year."
7955,"Sadly, I don't have statistics at hand and apparently, this year's data on the flu in Germany is quite unreliable."
7956,"But at least from our company's data I can say that we had a huge drop in sick days this year, especially in the flu/cold season."
7957,So probably measures that worked against SARS-CoV-2 also worked against other respiratory diseases.
7958,"Flu deaths alone can reach a couple thousand deaths per year, so that alone might even out the additional Covid-19 deaths."
7959,I already see Germans complaining next year that Covid-19 wasn't all that bad because there were not really any more deaths than in other years...
7960,"I think he meant that the amount of deaths roughly equals the population of LA, but it doesn't so I'm not sure"
7961,Archived link: [https://archive.is/F7iBw](https://archive.is/F7iBw)
7962,"If you see people that one post negative stuff, then report them so they get suspended/banned"
7963,"We are so fucked, and those of who have been trying so hard to follow the rules are so... demoralized."
7964,Nothing is working.
7965,LA culture is suicidal at this point.
7966,Oh I am confident there are plenty of people saying they shouldnt get it at all.
7967,"So far we are pretty sure that people who are asymptomatic and never get symptoms (as opposed to ""pre-symptomatic"") are not good at spreading the virus."
7968,"The current vaccines do a good job to prevent symptomatic infection, so it should follow that at the very least, people who have been vaccinated won't spread the virus much."
7969,"There is some evidence from studies in animals that indicates that it won't happen at all, but studies in humans will be a while."
7970,"I also remember when this all started, just waiting for the special snowflake to come back too."
7971,"No, they don't test post mortem in Japan."
7972,&gt;People in other parts of the world think everything is a threat to their freedoms.
7973,"Nah, it's not feeling of threat but a feeling of entitlement."
7974,"Narcissism here is often sugar-coated with descriptors like ""strong-willed"", ""individual-minded"", and ""freedom-loving"""
7975,What the duck?
7976,Just the nature of science when dealing with this issue.
7977,Bless you.
7978,We all love and appreciate you.
7979,Stay strong.
7980,fascist was not the right word.
7981,totalitarian might be a better word.
7982,"people often link them because nazi germany was both fascistic and totalitarian, but they don't have to be linked."
7983,"&gt; Jan 6 (Reuters) - The United Kingdom recorded 62,322 new COVID-19 cases on Wednesday and 1,041 deaths within 28 days of a positive test for the virus, according to official data."
7984,What is this within 28 days?
7985,Rolling data?
7986,It's very frustrating as someone who lives in California.
7987,"We are paying exorbitant rates to live somewhere that is environmentally toxic, at high risk for natural disasters, has an extreme level of wealth inequality, and is now heavily infected because we simply don't care about anyone but ourselves."
7988,I'm hoping my remote work becomes permanent so I can get the hell out of here.
7989,[removed]
7990,I think the only info we have is that some of the new strains are more contagious because they bind to human cells differently.
7991,Nobody is sure exactly what that means in terms of precautions or day to day behavior.
7992,You're doing the same thing...just tell me
7993,"They will blame the muslim brotherhood, mark my word 😂😂."
7994,"Yes but the strain didn't match anything from MIQ (managed iso and quarantine), or previously discovered in the community, so someone would have had to be tested negative twice in MIQ, and then spread it in the community but just to this one person."
7995,"We'll never know, but my bet is still on the frozen goods."
7996,"Yeah, and adding to that is the mistrust between federal and state governments, I think much federal involvement would make things worse."
7997,I feel like we're just reverting to medieval times.
7998,Like 'yeah it's the mask causing the disease because people started wearing masks after it started!'
7999,"I keep seeing this said as though it's fact, but I haven't seen any source for the rich buying the vaccine."
8000,"is it based in fact, or are you just speculating?"
8001,"Wow, this number keeps going up with every story."
8002,That’s terrible.
8003,"I’ve read comments inquiring about how many people and that their government is trying to cover up just how many, but it one way, I think that’s missing a major point."
8004,The fact that an entire ICU of patients are dead because the oxygen ran out is very scary.
8005,That should tell you just how fine of a line it is for some people to be able to survive or not.
8006,Vietnam and NZ used nearly identical strategies.
8007,"Both had closed borders, national lockdowns, infected people and all close contacts moved to state run quarantine facilities."
8008,What are you even talking about?
8009,I’m in California and do outdoors activities all the time...
8010,"Beaches are open, most trails are open, most parks are open"
8011,It's not mandatory.
8012,"You can choose not attend concerts and theaters, or travel, and not get the vaccine."
8013,It's up to you.
8014,This is in fact a great way to ensure people taking vaccines.
8015,"Sadly, much like masks and social distancing, local / state governments and businesses will be forced to choose between money and safety, and they will choose money because the fed is not supporting anyone to extend needed."
8016,[removed]
8017,"&gt;To encourage reluctant firefighters to get the COVID-19 vaccine, the Los Angeles Fire Department (LAFD) is offering raffled prizes for those who are willing to get the shot."
8018,"&gt;Among the prizes are gift cards for Airbnb and Lyft, Canary home security cameras, Google Nest entertainment systems, and Aventon fixed-gear bicycles, the Los Angeles Times reported."
8019,"--

&gt;According to public health officials, between 20 and 40 percent of L.A. County front-line workers who were given priority access to a COVID-19 vaccine have declined to take it."
8020,"In some hospitals, up to 50 percent of the staff has refused to get vaccinated."
8021,"&gt;So far, the trend seems to be affecting firefighters in the same way."
8022,"Only about 1,000 out of 3,400 were vaccinated during the first week that firefighters were able to receive the shot."
8023,"--

&gt;L.A. front-line workers' refusal to be vaccinated comes as the county experiences the worst coronavirus outbreak in the country."
8024,"--
&gt;As of Tuesday, there have been at least 827,498 coronavirus cases and 10,850 deaths in L.A. County, according to data from Johns Hopkins University."

8026,"We saved your life

Him: but did I ask you to?"
8027,Imagine how many healthcare workers are going to be permanently traumatized by this.
8028,And not just in Egypt.
8029,And some level of protection from variants for years too.
8030,What a bizarre response
8031,Im all for more money for this if it helps.
8032,But money doesn't really seem to be the problem.
8033,Some rural poor states are doing good while the rich west coast and NYC are struggling hard.
8034,Exactly this.
8035,It's why I can instantly tell someone doesn't know what they're talking about when they shriek: wHy cAN't tHE USa bE moRE lIKE NEW zEAlAND?
8036,This is a very low bar to set.
8037,Drastically lower than what was previously planned.
8038,"Thanks, messed up there but I think the point is the same."
8039,Lol they're being shipped to hospitals as fast as they can.
8040,It's not like Trump is sitting on a stockpile of them and Biden is going to magically overnight them via FedEx.
8041,"Well yeah, our government is covering shit up."
8042,Our government would claim it was pneumonia and accuse you of fear mongering
8043,I thought we were promised that the vaccine would be free?
8044,"Because most redditors, seemingly on this are are extreme introverts and probably secretly love the heavy isolation."
8045,"""Just 2 more weeks then you'll see"""
8046,"The asymptomatic person probably got it from something imported, became asymptomatic and acted as a carrier making others sick."
8047,If it was a different strain than the one that was already there it had to have come from the outside yeah.
8048,I guess its possible that he had symptoms too but never got tested for some reason.
8049,We'll never know indeed.

8065,"Quarantine was negotiated, with community leaders of minority communities enlisted to help convince any reluctant families to go to the facilities."

8105,Lol the CDC throws pneumonia and flu deaths together under one category.
8106,You could die of pneumonia and still be counted as an “influenza” statistical despite not catching a strain of the flu.

8121,Most other country's with over 1000 deaths only have 40K total cases per 1M?
8122,No even if care is limited unless family has medical training and supplies the hospital will be better.

8190,It's no easier to manage 5 million people when we have a lower rate of police per capita and no authoritarian means of enforcing the lockdown rules like China did.
8191,The US lockdowns and other Covid policies have all been managed on a state level anyway.
8192,"It's up to governors to manage their people and NZ would be ranked 25th in population as a US state, between Alabama and South Carolina."
8193,So ease of control had nothing to do with it.
8194,"The difference was the voluntary willingness of the population to comply with what the govt asked of us, even knowing it was largely unenforceable."
8195,In NZ people simply followed the rules without question even if they disagreed with them.
8196,"The media did cover businesses that broke the lockdown rules and nothing happened to them aside from public disapproval and the PM saying she was ""disappointed"" with them."
8197,"A very, very small number of people were fined and only after many warnings were ignored."
8198,I think he hit his head on the dismount.

8202,Sad that a vaccine was developed in record time when the earliest estimates were Fall of 2021 from the experts.
8203,"You're right, the science says it's much less likely for kids to infect you than a department store."
8204,They are quite different.
8205,Any evidence suggesting EMA will accept any laxer results than those from the FDA.
8206,Your quote only goes as far as : a lower effect vaccine may still be approved.
8207,It doesn’t say how lower it will still accept.
8208,I’d rather that than false confidence.

8227,I am so very sorry for such losses that could have been prevented (largely) with even mediocre leadership.
8228,I'm confused.
8229,If the workers don't have money and the businesses don't have money and the government is deep in debt then we should be asking where the heck the money went.
8230,A crisis means business losses.
8231,"Businesses, especially large ones, aren't entitled to demand a handout before they start working on emergency solutions."

8323,Thank you
8324,I do think that it’s interesting that one of the reasons the trials went so quick was that Covid was so widespread that they blew through their benchmarks of infections really quickly (and even set new ones).
8325,Much of the time with previous vaccines is spent waiting and waiting fir a particular # of the placebo group to become infected.
8326,People act like it’s actually a bunch of people sitting in a lab analyzing the potential vaccine when it’s more like waiting for enough people to become infected to have your numbers to crunch.
8327,Same in the UK currently.
8328,"You can leave home but basically only for ""essential"" shopping, limited exercise or emergencies like seeking medical attention."
8329,And going to work if you absolutely have to work elsewhere.
8330,What a wildly fantastic imagination you have.
8331,It is different.
8332,It seems the UK variant is much more widespread globally than the South African variant.
8333,In a cruel twist of fate the South African variant seems to be even more contagious than the UK variant.
8334,And so starts 2021...
8335,But completely ignoring the fact that some of his vaccines were causing Bell’s Palsy in Africa.
8336,The media probably shouldn’t be your last stop for scientific information basically ever...

8338,The more vaccines the better.
8339,"I think it would be better for the US to offer funding in exchange for complete control of the IP, but it would have to be a lot more than $1 billion for something that valuable."
8340,There's so much the US could do differently.
8341,It just won't.
8342,Too many people scream bloody murder if you even so much as mention (actual) lockdowns.
8343,"They won't even wear a mask because of the ""me, me, me"" culture."
8344,Covid will just go on unhindered until everyone has either been infected or vaccinated to such extent herd immunity is achieved.
8345,But hospitals aren’t distributing them efficiently.
8346,Preach!!

8378,"Apart from the ultimate strain on our medical system, the business sectors are going to notice just how much their workaholics kept things going."
8379,"If ever you (or anyone else who's dealing with post COVID) feel the need to vent, my inbox is open."

8382,"&gt;“Seasons make no difference” is blatantly false

you're ignoring the last part of the comment you replied to:

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Seasons make no difference is there is no Covid present at all, thus the  elimination approach."
8383,"We stop all cases at the border, so winter isn't a  risk."
8384,"&amp;#x200B;

is **\[if\]** there is no Covid present at all, thus the  elimination approach."
8385,No problem muchacho.
8386,I encourage all people to be sceptical of information.
8387,"It's become more and more difficult to wade through a sea of disinformation campaigns, both foreign and domestic."
8388,"There is nothing wrong with posing questions, how else would be learn?"
8389,Just be vigilant of source material and how we formulate our views.
8390,The English Virus
8391,Not every single person is eligible to or needs to be vaccinated.
8392,No one Under 16 can be vaccinated and something like 40% of deaths are from people over 80 in nursing homes.
8393,We can make a massive dent with 1+ million a day in a few months.
8394,That is absolutely true.
8395,As is the opposite.
8396,It could just be because of the higher transmissibility of the mutation.
8397,"Yall paying 20 euros for a damn pizza delivery but wont pay 15 for a marvel of biotech, delivered at extremely low temperatures."
8398,Smh
8399,Taken literally the WHO are correct on this.
8400,My guess is it's an indication of the UK gov's desperation.
8401,"At 1,000 deaths per day they need to reduce that quickly."
8402,They eased up too much before Christmas.
8403,"nothing good has ever come out of rushing things, human error being an example."
8404,"90% of the population would need to get vaccinated to achieve herd immunity, [according](https://www.reuters.com/article/health-coronavirus-usa-idUSL1N2J411V) to Dr. Fauci."
8405,"I’m sorry, what?"
8406,Except half my kids have parents who are anti maskers and do all sorts of gathering.
8407,At least we won’t have the same leadership we had last year.
8408,Thx for the input!
8409,"I’ll tell you as an American, I am fucking SICK of everything turning to American politics."
8410,"Holy shit is it annoying, tiresome and beat into the fucking ground"
8411,"&gt; it looks at the overall balance of safety and efficacy for each vaccine individually 

Individually, not comparing to existing vaccines."
8412,why ?
8413,it's not effective enough.
8414,I want anything over 90%
8415,I prefer teaching the younger kids and frankly the kids switching rooms 7 times a day would make me more wary.
8416,"Wow, I am surprised that only two active duty soldiers have died from this."
8417,I would imagine that it would spread very quickly through the military since there are a lot of people living and working in close quarters.
8418,"I guess soldiers tend to be young and healthy, which offers them a lot of protection."
8419,It’s not that easy.
8420,"People are literally choosing between “do I want my kid to catch covid at school, or at the homeless shelter”."
8421,It’s the “no wage only spend” meme taken to downright murderous absurdity.
8422,We can’t just leave single or low income parents with 1800 for the year and surprise pikachu face when they say “my kid needs to go to school so I can work”
8423,Sweden has lower mortality than most years too.
8424,The link to strictness of restrictions isn't entirely clear cut
8425,Then companies wouldnt exist.
8426,We call nonprofits ngos.
8427,The whole reason why companies exist is to act as a money generating machine.
8428,The actual vaccine rollout is on the actual country and not the fault of EU.
8429,I wish we would receive more than these fairly low doses we receive right now of the Pfizer/Biontech vaccine which I do blame the EU for as they didn't purchase enough when they had the chance.
8430,Many of the workers who are truly on the front line have already had covid.
8431,"Given the results that have come out recently regarding natural immunity, it's not unreasonable to pass (for the time being) on the vaccine if you've already had it."
8432,Yep.
8433,Only UK and India to the best of my knowledge.
8434,"I think I'm addition to this, middle-class Americans with insurance think they will be treated like low-income Americans on Medicaid."
8435,The rich will still get the best medical care because they can afford it.
8436,Then you have everyone else who will get the scraps (similar to scenarios we see play out time and time again in our country).
8437,"I think the great isn't so much that the lower income will be raised to meet the middle class, but this will lower the middle class."
8438,"IMO, the only way to insure quality medical care for all is to install leaders who are also ""one of us"" and not pay of the elite."
8439,Of course the issue is that nothing lasts forever.
8440,"Worst case scenario would be to have nationalized medicine with a corrupt, capitalist government."
8441,why kill yourself ?
8442,"don;t harm yourself over a lockdown,"
8443,I believe you were downvoted because of the onset appearance of your skepticism towards the subject.
8444,"Without doing a study, it's simple math that I believe any teacher should be able to consider."
8445,We're learning as we're going with Covid but the one thing about data that we have always known is that it can be trusted with proper applications.
8446,The creator of the PCR test even stated this about proper application of test results..
8447,"It's all about proper application when saying ""yes this data fits""."
8448,The actual mortality rate of covid is a hairline worth of an increment less than what was prevented long before we had deaths to create a database of this.
8449,We shouldn't say that Covid is less deadly than predicted just because it's slightly off.
8450,The practice of applying data for perceived observation is something that scientists usually have practice with.
8451,You dont have practice with a pandemic.
8452,"Instead of focusing on getting the numbers near perfect, focus on saving lives!"
8453,That easy to understand math; there are more combinations to come into contact with the sickness.
8454,This is not a cancer in which some people just tend to be more at risk at contracting it due to DNA heritage.
8455,You contract Covid by coming into contact with the symptoms.
8456,"Okay so sick kids can't go to school, problems solved."
8457,"No, because the virus may still spread even if the sick person isn't sneezing or coughing coupled with the fact that you keep repeating kids are less likely to be symptomatic."
8458,That creates more combinations in which a teacher can come in contact with the virus increasing their infection rate to 333%.
8459,"Let's not scare anyone, that only means that teachers are 3 &amp; ⅓ times more likely than non teachers to contract the virus."
8460,"So if I come into contact with one sick person, it's likely that you'll come into contact with at least 3 sick people."
8461,"Again as I stated with the mortality rate, it's about the application and you can't have ⅓ of a person."
8462,The application makes sense and honestly I think it should be higher.
8463,3:1 ratio teacher to non teacher.
8464,"A school with 500-1500 students, I believe it could be higher but maybe I'm ignorant to the prevention methods taking place in public schools."
8465,Anyway I upvoted you and I feel like everyone should share their opinions and embrace their differences and ignorance.

8539,"So you're acknowledging that it's not the situation that's ironic, it's the fact that I criticized China?"

8541,That's called coincidence.
8542,"You sure love to change your story, don't you?"

8627,"Joinpoint analyses revealed an increase in deaths attributed to causes other than COVID-19, with 2 reaching statistical significance."

It took until September for the CDC to mention this on their website."
8906,Your point regarding the correct use of airborne/aerosol is irrelevant irregardless.
8907,This is about the message that the public received initially from both the CDC and WHO.
8908,Specifically the idea that the virus was not proven to spread through air and there was no need for masks.
8909,"If you suggest that they did not say this initially and that it was a misinterpretation by the media, then why didn't they speak out and correct this error for several months?"

9010,It is a measure to prevent new importation of the infection.

9053,Urrrrr who gives our the visas??

9055,I decided to make a new comment for this - I found this webpage which explains the difference between grades.
9056,"[http://www-personal.umich.edu/\~lpt/oxlabel.htm](http://www-personal.umich.edu/~lpt/oxlabel.htm) In short, because it's cheaper to just have one set of equipment, most oxygen producers have the separation machine deliver medical oxygen at the tap."
9057,"To remain certified as medical oxygen, it's got to have a certified analysis and be transported in certified containers that have only had medical oxygen in them."
9058,"Basically, because medical oxygen is regulated as a drug, there are more hoops to jump through."
9059,The 'lack of oxygen' probably relates to the logistics of certifying the oxygen and the supply of certified transport containers.
9060,What is going on with the Czech Republic???
9061,They're getting like 17K cases now??
9062,That's astronomical relative to their population.
9063,Israel is doing so many things right.
9064,Thanks for the fix.
9065,Embarrasing on NL's part.
9066,Even worse than France somehow.
9067,"As a new year begins, Arizona is again in dire shape, with a higher rate  of new cases than any other state."
9068,Hospitalizations and deaths have  surpassed records.
9069,"Over the last week, the state has averaged more than  8,000 cases a day, more than double the summer peak."

9074,"Well it's a good thing, if we're going by your little scenario, that 100% of people who get Covid aren't hospitalized"
9075,"I can read, and that's exactly what you said, then you just made another post reiterating the same thing."
9076,It is not.
9077,The companies whose PCR tests can distinguish S dropouts are seeing on the order of 2% dropout tests.
9078,"Most of those are due to actual sequence rather than a failure of one of the primers for other reasons, but in the US there are multiple S deletion lineages circulating so only a subset of that is the lineage from the UK."
9079,No one’s safe.
9080,The whole damn country is wallowing in corruption.
9081,"&gt;Again, deaths are not the metric by which we should gauge the pandemic."
9082,It's definitely the metric we should gauge the pandemic lol.
9083,"I get that ICU capacity is something that needs to be considered, but if people don't need to use the ICU in order to not die, then the ICU capacity isn't a concern because the people who are getting sick aren't at risk of dying."
9084,"You can pretend that because some 30 year olds are in the ICU that it means we'll be overwhelmed without restrictions, but only like 2 out of every 1000 30 year olds who get this virus are going to die without ICU care as opposed to 15% of 80 year olds."
9085,"Once the old people get the vaccination, the ICU problem goes away because the vast majority of healthy adults survive without hospitalization, even ones with severe cases."
9086,"CCP had the self imposed great leap and culture revolution, Vietnam had bombing and sanctions."
9087,"Vietnam has pretty much good relations with all the nations, China on the other hand..."
9088,"Lucky for those citizens, they won't have to feel guilty about spreading the virus."
9089,I think Trump certainly played a big part in encouraging anti maskers.
9090,"Though I agree that anti maskers are everywhere but in the US, it is far more prevalent."
9091,"At the moment UAE residents, including foreign workers, still enjoy the civil rights that governments in Europe and America have taken from their people."
9092,"UAE residents are free to travel around the country and abroad, eat indoors in restaurants, see films in cinemas, work out in gyms, and meet up with groups of people."
9093,"Meanwhile in the UK, Ireland and some US states, people have had even their freedom of movement taken away by the government."
9094,The government even dictates to them when they are allowed to see friends and family and how many they are allowed to see.
9095,This is not because the UAE has eradicated the coronavirus.
9096,It's because they have taken a respectful approach to managing it that does not infringe on human rights while doing what can be done to protect the most vulnerable.
9097,Difficult to lock down when you're just straight up dying
9098,&gt;taking care of the house?
9099,Everyone does that.
9100,That's the rub...not everyone does that.
9101,"For those that do, yes, it's an unpaid job and they should consider it as such."
9102,No one is begrudging that.
9103,"The concern was that homemaking and childcare often falls exclusively on women in a dual adult household who often have their own ""real"" jobs."
9104,"It's called the ""second shift"" in relevant literate if you'd like to read about it."
9105,Many modern households have more equitable divisions of labor but those conversations happened largely as a consequence of Arlie's book.
9106,"&gt;Apparently in some of the UK guidance this was recommended as an absolute last resort if there were no doses of the same vaccine available

I'm not sure it meant that."
9107,"I believe the guidance covered if it was unknown which original dose was given and therefore what procedures to use thereafter, but I may have misread it."
9108,That doesn't preclude a more deadly mutation from happening though.
9109,Jus tthat it is less likely to be very long lasting.
9110,"A very deadly, very transmissable strain would be horrifying, even if it is very short lived."
9111,The second wave of Spanish Flu was much more deadly and could have been due to a mutation.
9112,"""Oh but they mark every death as a covid death"""
9113,To think the virus has been handled so well in China they don't even need a vaccine.
9114,"If only there was a centralized head source where the information came from, then it could be vetted whether it's true or not"
9115,This is why you Americans fail if lying to yourself is your priority over learning from others
9116,Good!
9117,They shouldn’t be put at risk because of their job.
9118,"Vaccines first, then return to work."
9119,The majority of green house gasses are produced by a minority of people.
9120,Killing lots of people will have little effect on the production of green house gasses.

9122,"Honestly for those lower on vaccine priority like myself, I think it’s going to come down to weighing acceptable risk and learning to live with it."
9123,And everyone is going to have to learn to live with the reality of coronavirus if Strains keep mutating.
9124,It’s discouraging for sure BUT I have hope.
9125,"That's another 100,000 deaths in the US at a minimum if they had to recajigger A new vaccinne."
9126,"&gt; I believe that we are relatively moderate on infections per capital, but the LA metro area is well over 15 million people, so even a moderate rate of infections per capita means a huge number of sick people."

9133,"&gt; Well, it's true that we know SOMETHING, based on the study of people that received TWO jabs."
9134,"To extrapolate this knowledge is dangerous and not scientific, that's all I'm saying."
9135,So you accept that immunity from the 2 jab scheme can only be assumed for about 2 months then.
9136,Anything after that is dangerous extrapolation.
9137,"Wow, finally people who do think of the facts regarding the vaccine!"
9138,"No anti-vaxx, no pro-vaxx, just fact-vaxx."
9139,I found them on this sub!
9140,"Hey, don't shit on them for having good intentions."
9141,Agreed.
9142,Anything else would be really concerning as it would mean that governments are taking totalitarian measures while no longer having the justification of saving lives.
9143,"I mean, duh."
9144,The reason why past pandemics weren’t so overwhelming is because the diseases were too effective at killing us.
9145,"It’s harder to spread swine flu when you tend to get sick right away and it leaves you unable to stand up, as opposed to walking around symptom-free for a while and spreading it around first."
9146,"It’s only a matter of when, not if, and that’s why we need to invest in better ways to monitor and enforce compliance in safety measures."

9154,Why are you spewing misinformation?
9155,Israel offered Palestine aid for getting them vaccinated and they refused.
9156,Instead Palestine is making plans to get the Russian vaccine on its own
9157,Honestly the fact that we're nearly a year into this thing and don't have every single person at an airport rapid tested before entering is mind-boggling.
9158,I just returned to the UK from the US and our flight was nearly completely full.
9159,Not one of those people had to prove a negative test prior to getting on the plane.
9160,Watched a webinar from a Belgian top doctor about vaccinations.
9161,Turns out more than half of vaccinations are performed wrong.
9162,"Too high, too low, not deep enough, too long time between shots."
9163,It's unbelievable how much can go wrong.
9164,Yes it does.
9165,Care home residents account for 1/3 of all deaths.
9166,Remove them from the equation and ICU and deaths should plummet.
9167,I didn't say reduce to 0.
9168,"Also, remember that vaccination of 80+ year olds is also taking place outside of care homes and the average age of death is 80"
9169,My point being these people are going to do it anyway.
9170,"Why not take them for 10, 25, or 50k and just be speedy about it."

9175,"I don't have that much trust in their judgement, and even less in their scientists' independence."
9176,Can you not read?
9177,Because that’s not what was said at all.
9178,"I also didn’t say the data wasn’t accurate, because anyone who knows even the absolute minimum about statistics knows that basic data only means so much."
9179,You can spit absolute facts while simultaneously ignoring the reality of the situation.
9180,And the reality is the situation is that the population density of the US versus Europe is not comparable.
9181,No matter how hard you cry.
9182,It’s not an anti-American sentiment either- it’s reality.
9183,"Most of our cities are actually doing better than our rural areas, outside of NYC which was hit early on."
9184,"Because if it, our rural towns are competing per capita with some of the densest cities in the world."
9185,"When people live on top of each other, the virus is going to spread no matter what."
9186,"When people have the opportunity to spread out, like the majority of the US, the problem boils down to citizens not following restrictions."
9187,"I get that might be too complex for you, but goddamn dude."
9188,70 million of those nickels and cents
9189,It's so dumb to act like hospital capacity can't be increased.
9190,Like it's been almost a year.
9191,Come on.
9192,China built a hospital in like 3 weeks when they had their first outbreak.
9193,"And AZ this month, there's no time to waste."
9194,1/4 of our country would be vaccinated by June if there only were Pfizer and Moderna (double dose).
9195,"Sweden has in fact 3 parallel systems of governance/administration - national government, regions and municipalities."
9196,FHM is part of the national governance / authorities.
9197,Hospitals are managed by regional governments.
9198,"Care homes, elderly homes, special housings are managed by the municipalities."
9199,"Hospital deaths are often reported quite fast, as the system there is already established for managing high levels of reporting - some of these go through direct healthcare database that is national-wide."
9200,"However, if it is deaths that have occurred in elderly care or special housing, they first get reported from the specific home to that home's healthcare provider (some homes are private, other run directly by the municipality), then the provider reports them to the municipality, then the municipality reports them to the region, then the region reports to FHM."
9201,"Prior to the holidays that meant that 90% of all deaths were reported within 11 days, (50% were reported in less than 7 days)."
9202,"However, now with the holidays, it means more people up the chain of reporting might have been taking leave and also only two days a week to report things, the lag has increased to three weeks or more."
9203,I am hoping it will go down again in a week or so when the public holidays are over (until Easter at least).
9204,"I read a post by a guy saying he had been a doctor for 20 years and had seen it all, but had never seen a death certificate say ""flu""."
9205,"It would be ""pneumonia"" or some other complications."
9206,I'm guessing that's what's going on here.
9207,The flu numbers they throw around (for the US at least) are statistical estimates of the number that probably died from it.
9208,And early on some people compared those best-guess numbers against test-confirmed covid deaths and declared the flu to be just as bad.
9209,One can see that effect everywhere in Europe but still school are locked down and students are suffering and learning less and less.
9210,We are heading into a generation of uneducated people
9211,"&gt; I get it, it sucks, its been a long time."
9212,"But if you think were going to ""open up"" and go back to ""normal"" your mistaken."
9213,Things arent ever going to be the same and rushing into that doesnt do anything other than put more people at risk.
9214,"Nah, fuck this."
9215,You're free to hide in your house for the rest of your life.
9216,"As soon as most people are vaccinated I'm burning all my masks in a bonfire, saying ""fuck you"" to social distancing, and hitting the bars."
9217,"Just keep denying everything, there is no covid lol."
9218,"You morons underplaying everything is the main reason you're in such trouble, and that's why you continue to reach estimates that were previously considered 'extreme' ."
9219,Idiots

9234,The psych and police custody patients are agitated waiting on the walls.
9235,"Not that I mean to dismiss your efforts, but when did this turn into a detective novel?"
9236,"&gt; Most likely the fact that people couldn't gather outside boosted the virus, but it seems there is a seasonal component."
9237,People gathering inside rather than outside is a seasonal component.
9238,There seems to be this misunderstanding that seasonality implies only environmental factors like how far do droplets spread at x temp and humidity.
9239,Seasonality involves both the environmental and behavioral factors that spread respiratory illnesses in winter.
9240,The fact that kids are usually in school in winter and not in summer?
9241,Yes even that is part of the flu's seasonality.
9242,How did that work for the air traffic controllers in 81?
9243,My plan?

9249,Short of total isolation (i.e.
9250,"no one at all ever enters or leaves the house for any reason), acting responsibly just reduces your chances of contracting the virus to various degrees."
9251,"If enough other people in your community get it, even relatively strict individual measures can only protect you so much."
9252,Didn't it mutated before?
9253,"Well countries that already have contained and taking measures it wont have much of an issue but countries have not contained it since the start LOL, good luck cos you are really going to need it."
9254,"Im not kidding at all, we all had dealt with it for a year and multiple vaccines have come out and NOBODY can say we were not prepared for it."
9255,I would have liked to see the police at least try to enforce covid regulations with the same gusto they did for drug regulations.
9256,IMO Violating things like quarantine or mask rules is really more drunk driving than drug use in that it can harm uninvolved third parties.
9257,"In Europe, they're having full classes."
9258,Nothing like the hybrid programs proposed in the United States.

9311,The same thing goes.
9312,You can’t force a resident / general member of the public to take it.
9313,But if it is your job it should be mandatory.
9314,"And even when the vaccine is eventually administered to almost everyone, masks, social distancing etc is still going to be a thing."
9315,"Depending on the Vaccine it’s not 100% effective, so all these measures would still be in place."
9316,And it would be the nurses bringing the virus in so it’s on the nurses to be vaccinated.
9317,"To be completely honest I’m sort of shocked they’re saying no, to be a nurse is usually wanting to help, not just a job."
9318,I get your point but the chances of residents getting Covid of nurses are vaccinated is between 3 &amp; 6 percent ( vaccine dependent ).
9319,So it could be argued that the residents not be vaccinated at all.
9320,"I’m not arguing that, but there could be an argument there for it."
9321,Unfortunately we would need to replace the staff with robots for what you're suggesting.
9322,"There's two former Yugoslavia countries in the EU, Slovenia and Croatia."
9323,Albiania that this article calls balcan was not in Yugoslavia.
9324,&gt;Hungary might be less rich than the western European countries but in a global scale is still one of the richest countries of the world.
9325,"Bulgaria maybe less so, but still far from what could be considered a third world."
9326,"The ""balcan"" countries mentioned in this article aren't third world either."
9327,"They're just below EU's poorest country, Bulgaria."
9328,Note that EU is not keeping them locked out of the EU.
9329,"North Macedonia has disputes with it's neighbours, Serbia does not want to join (but I guess expects free vaccines from the EU anyway because ..."
9330,?)
9331,and Albania just started talks march 2020.
9332,Lady who released information had her house raided and property confiscated.
9333,Oh wait that was Florida
9334,"Yes Ireland among other European countries, take care of the elderly."
9335,America is (in many cases) far different.
9336,"Some are fortunate to live with a sibling and they can look after each other, while others who have financial means, can stay at a nice retirement community."
9337,"I would say a vast majority though, are considered a burden."
9338,one of the few times they are acknowledged is during the reading of the will.
9339,"woah you’re describing a situation extremely close to mine... was sick in mid March for 5 weeks, couldnt get a test because pandemic started."
9340,"Had cough for week one, then shortness of breath (would keep me up at night), fatigue, felt like my lungs couldnt fill completely, and later weeks had extremely loss of appetite."
9341,After the 5 weeks my appetite almost immediately came back and I felt much more normal.
9342,then a week later my congestion and slight shortness of breath came back and I’ve kinda been that way ever since.
9343,I constantly have to clear my throat/lungs of congestion and sometimes it feels like I have shortness of breath from not being able to absorb oxygen properly.
9344,These days I suppose I feel better but every day all day is the congestion that I have to clear my throat for.
9345,When I have shortness of breath it feels like I get winded easily and can’t fully catch my breath.
9346,"I had a huge suspicion all year that I had gotten COVID in March, but I just a month ago took the antibody test and it came back negative, but I feel it may have been a false negative from taking it too late after seeing the comments in this post."
9347,Yours was the one I related to the most.
9348,"if you know the right way to finesse shit you can virtually do whatever you want, or at least drastically less than if you were in school"
9349,This will be interesting to see.
9350,"If oxygen ran out, it would typically run out for the entire hospital, not just the ICU and alarms would sound with enough time to replenish long before it ran out."
9351,"The point I'm trying to make is the use of the word ""failure"" implies that something went wrong, engineering related."
9352,"Although possible it is very unlikely, it is much more likely to be negligence."

9358,"Food for thought : if there are as many deaths happening and not being counted, wouldn't media capture it?"
9359,The death count might have a 5-10 percent margin of error but still it is quite low and india being a younger population is definitely helping.

9370,people die every day because they cant afford medicine due to insurance companies not covering it
9371,I still think thats a disappointing figure... People are dying vaccines will save lives  the urgency is not nearly enough.
9372,Almost 12M doses distributed but not used.
9373,We need to get to the point distributed supply is being used days after it is distributed not weeks
9374,"0 was never realistic 366,943 is close to the best case scenario that were forecasted"
9375,How much time passed before it was obvious he was having a negative reaction to the shot?
9376,They literally don’t have a choice.
9377,"If they screw up like the US, UK, Sweden etc, it’s over for them."
9378,Does anyone know how their economy is doing?
9379,Asking not to hate on their response but simply to compare it with the data of my country (Germany) because we actually paid a lot.
9380,The article doesn't mention whether school staff was contracting COVID in school or out of school.
9381,Our local high school was having a COVID problem and has been on remote learning for months while the rest of the schools continue in person.
9382,"Since moving to remote learning, the high school still post regular positive COVID test for staff working remotely, at a rate far greater than any other school."
9383,Major hospitals in the area are also reporting that staff members are getting COVID outside of work because they choose not to follow protocols during their free time.
9384,Most of the schools in my district are working very hard and have very low positivity rates amoung students and staff.
9385,If school follow the protocols then they have a low chance of transmitting COVID.
9386,If it was the Auckland cluster I'm pretty sure it was linked back to a rubbish bin?
9387,I could be wrong though
9388,"Lol “get out of it”

You realize we aren’t just getting a year to do anything we want right?"
9389,You would think the time for a consultant would be before you start the process.
9390,This feels like political ass covering more than anything else.
9391,Who's Tommy John?
9392,"By general, you mean no restrictions (as in anyone can get it)?"
9393,"If so, probably sooner than that."
9394,But there will likely be supply shortages.
9395,If you had an iron lung yes....
9396,i'd be good either way
9397,"Not totally sure, the article indicates that Germany is having a lot of cases among the elderly right now so it may be simply that the surge in the UK is concentrated in a younger lower risk population than in Germany so there are a higher percentage of severe cases in Germany now."
9398,Agreed.
9399,States think that by expanding the list that will put pressure on hospitals to release their supply.
9400,So far that’s not really panning out.
9401,"My hospital has stock but they claim that they are still vaccinating their are staff....after 3 weeks of continuous supply, they still won’t offer it to the public."
9402,"It’s also a medical school (connected to it), so I suspect they are also vaccinating their medical students."
9403,What do B cells do?
9404,that’s because is lab made virus

9423,Born and raised on the coast--definitely pay to play.
9424,"I can't imagine having it any other way, though!"
9425,"This should be evaluated case by case by a physician, but no it isn’t necessarily better to stay home."
9426,Some higher risk patients who are seemingly fine get admitted for observation.
9427,"If they take a turn, they can go downhill fast."
9428,"Sometimes, it’s best to have those high risk patients in a hospital bed so they can receive quick medical intervention."
9429,Currently reading this with zero sense of smell.
9430,"Yankee scented oil, bleach, vinegar, perfume, spicy food... everything smells like water."
9431,"But as I understand it, if you are vaccinated, you can still get Covid and potentially transmit it, you should just have a milder case, so the resident could still get it."
9432,I just go back and forth as mandating things can become a slippery slope.
9433,What happens if a company mandates it and an employee dies?
9434,(I know that is a stretch but anything can happen.).
9435,Or even if they have an anaphylactic reaction?
9436,Do they then have to compensate?
9437,"Again, just throwing it out there."
9438,The residents are allowed to leave and have visitors so they could potentially acquire it that way.
9439,As if anybody would care where it happened anyway.
9440,It’s not like they held a gun to the virus and told it to mutate.
9441,Why is reinfection more likely than being PCR positive for months?
9442,"Balkan is usually a byword for ""former Yugoslavian""."
9443,My opinion is due to all the nationalism and sectarianism in those countries they don't like being referred as ex Yugoslavia and this became the politically correct thing to do.
9444,It is a bit nitpicky to complain of this.
9445,"Everyone clicked in this article expecting to read about Bosnia and Serbia, not Hungary and Greece."
9446,Hungary might be less rich than the western European countries but in a global scale is still one of the richest countries of the world.
9447,"Bulgaria maybe less so, but still far from what could be considered a third world."
9448,Agreed.
9449,The problem is there’s no central leadership on distribution.
9450,States and Federal government only concerned themselves with supply side.
9451,"They’ve left it to hospitals, pharmacies and cities to get it out."
9452,Everyone is being too conservative.
9453,My local pharmacy is stockpiling so that they can have enough to vaccinate a nursing home (including workers) in total....rather than having to go back daily and try and keep track of who got it and who didn’t.
9454,I can understand that to a point.
9455,"And some hospitals are stockpiling to cover all their workers, but it’s taking a while to get all their workers in to get it (and some may be choosing to not get it, but the hospital doesn’t know that)."
9456,"[https://abc7ny.com/parcare-vaccine-fraud-attorney-general-ny-covid/9143911/](https://abc7ny.com/parcare-vaccine-fraud-attorney-general-ny-covid/9143911/)

New York set it up so that only hospitals can administer vaccines, but now the hospital administrators have slowed everything to a snails pace because hospitals that vaccinate outside of the priority guidelines are being hit with fraud charges and massive fines."
9457,"I find it hard to believe that in the next 12 months, according to your link, we'll only have 40% of the population vaccinated."
9458,I also find it hard to believe that at peak vaccination rate it will only be 1.2mn per day.
9459,I don't think most people in my area even realize the police department and other first responders are refusing to take vaccines that were reserved for them.
9460,"Of course, these are the same first responders who have been refusing to wear masks for this entire pandemic."
9461,So really I guess I shouldn't be surprised at all.
9462,"There’s plenty of supply, hospitals just aren’t giving it out."
9463,Several states have around 70% of the vaccines delivered to them that haven’t been used.
9464,I hate trump more than the average person but seriously man?
9465,"You don’t have to wear a mask anymore, as long as you just hunker down at home and use contactless delivery services until mask requirements end."
9466,But seriously for now still wear the mask (or stay at home) until they can figure out an app or a card or something to prove that you took the vaccine.
9467,"Plus you have to get 2 shots, and it takes a few weeks to get to full effect."
9468,"The US state with lowest number of Covid deaths is Hawaii, with 204 deaths per million."
9469,This is the only state in the US with a lower death per million rate than the world average.
9470,"So even in the US, being a remote island with easy to control borders is a huge advantage."
9471,"Hey boss, this freezer broke."
9472,"Luckily there is a couple of hundred of my friends, various celebrities, actors and sports stars outside."
9473,"No, they should be ransomed for the second dose."
9474,"They already made an expectation for a monetary exchange, so just raise the price for the second dose while intimating that it could be bad for them if they don't get it on schedule."
9475,"I feel ya, and I’m only a scientist-in-training!"
9476,It seems to come back for most people.
9477,So probably not a lot.
9478,Who smelt it dealt it.
9479,An acquaintance of mine lives in Az and on social media he’s always posting indoor dining to his story.
9480,The only reason why I haven’t deleted the douche is because I want to see how long it takes for him to start posting about how he has Covid.
9481,"As a non-American, we’re sick of y’all stupid ass politics too."
9482,"And when it’s not your election or domestic terrorism related to politics, it’s a school shooting."
9483,Why can’t y’all just be normal
9484,They’re diverting blame from themselves
9485,My state has been really good to vaccinate long term care homes.
9486,Hoping to see some results in the numbers after those folks get the second shot in a couple weeks.
9487,"Sounds about right, sadly."
9488,When there are people left who want the vaccine but can’t get it they should skip these people and move on to the next group.
9489,Once everyone who wants it has it then we can start trying to incentivize people who are hesitant to get it so we can get to herd immunity.
9490,Yes.
9491,I agree.
9492,"I can only make the comparison to someone checking, but they can stand behind plexiglass and wipe down between each customer and wear gloves."
9493,My district isn’t providing us with gloves or plexiglass and I definitely can’t wipe down between each person.
9494,I’m not saying it’s void of risk because it’s not.
9495,But to me it’s apples to oranges.
9496,"Desk jobs aren’t the same as grocery stores which aren’t the same as daycares, which aren’t the same as nursing homes, etc etc."
9497,each job has inherent risk:
9498,"This virus has zero chance at killing the human race, covid wasn't even the leading cause of death in the United States in 2020"
9499,"""Apparent lack of solidarity of Western Countries"", ""pro Russian leader stoking flames"", derogatory terms about Chinese and Russian vaccines."
9500,And absolutely no consideration about the crazy idea that perhaps the EU doesn't give a fuck about countries which aren't in the EU.
9501,"Any sort of criticism, not matter how valid and well constructed, can only be the work of paid russian trolls."
9502,The entire bit about Albania is really weird.
9503,The president wants Russia to apologize for... Offering their vaccines?
9504,"And the justification given by the article is that ""it is not approved in the EU"" even though this shouldn't matter for a country that isn't in the bloc?"
9505,"What is it, a colony?"
9506,"Anyway, I hope a solution is found for the former yoguslavian countries and Albania because they are one of the worst affected areas, and no one should care if the vaccine is russian, Chinese, German or whatever"
9507,"I see a lot of people spending __BIG__ at movies, restaurants, bars, arcades, hotels, etc."
9508,when we are 100% back to normal.

9518,I don't doubt that some people are have long term issues with a viral infection just like has happened in other viral infections.
9519,What I dispute is the number.
9520,"I think a good percentage of these people have other health issues like anxiety, depression, etc."
9521,that have very similar health complications that they attribute to long covid.
9522,I wish I could find the articles but I've seen several where a person says that had COVID in March (no positive test just they were sick) and have have long COVID...they usually don't have antibodies.
9523,Those are the people I suspect are less long COVID and more mental issues.
9524,They absolutely have the right to their own choice and autonomy.
9525,And their employers have the right to not let them work in a medical setting and put their residents at risk.
9526,"I know, but, they should know."

9532,"I always wondered why they took pertussis out, I’m guessing it’s because of these reactions."
9533,It’s back in now.
9534,It sounds like you’re saying only currently circulating antibodies can protect against actual infection.
9535,And that long lasting antibodies are impossible.
9536,Plus antibodies can create severe infection.
9537,"Given that there’s no sure fire way to protect someone from severe COVID then, how does that shape public policy?"
9538,Why are we developing vaccines?
9539,I also had a few insomnia too I couldn't sleep because I couldn't breath properly...
9540,I had to lean forward to try to breath or even yawn... not working all the time...
9541,I feel that my SOB is coming from my throat (trachea I think).
9542,When I want to do a big inspiration the air get blocked inside my throat and doesn't come through.
9543,The feeling is like when you run a lot you get breathless and you can't catch your breath it's blocked... this is what is happening to me.
9544,"The first months I also felt that I had something in my throat because I add to ""clear it"" a lot especially when I failed to catch my breath..."
9545,I don't know if it makes sens to you?
9546,"It's been a few weeks that I feel a bit better but the inconfort is still here (whenever I walk or talk a lot... even a 10 minutes walk can make me breathless or even doing some house cleaning...)

I had 2 weeks holidays for festive period so I think that resting has helped me."
9547,"I live in the UK and we are entering lockdown number 3 so I hope that I will keep getting better by resting... but I still feel that my SOB won't leave me :( it's so weird...

Is your SOB comes from your throat as well?"
9548,And yes your antibodies test was way too late.
9549,In September my doctor already told me that she won't do an antibodies test on me as it was probably too late.
9550,I do some research and looks like people like us having long symptoms are the ones that haven't been at the hospital.
9551,I feel really angry because when I got diagnosed the doctor said that I will feel better because I'm young.
9552,I was calling them every month and it took them 6 months to finally examine me in person and do some checkups... maybe this is why they don't find anything because everything is gone!
9553,I'm young yes but 10 months later and my shortness of breath is still here !
9554,If you want to talk about it I'm here!
9555,It's a journey and I wonder when it will be over... if it will be really over?
9556,I'm pretty sure that I had covid.
9557,I never had such breathing issues in my life...

9622,"I agree, the whole thing isn’t easy and I prefer well thought out discussions before mandating anything."
9623,"I am not opposed to the vaccine and I will eventually get it myself, but I am not sure I am completely comfortable mandating something like this."
9624,"I believe as time goes by, more people will change their mind so vaccinate those who want it first."
9625,What’s encouraging is Paul Offit is not sunshine and lollipops with his predictions.
9626,I remember reading him saying it was masks and distancing until 2023 at some point.
9627,If he’s saying this he has to be confident.
9628,These guys know every syllable is being parsed by 330MM people.
9629,Let’s be honest too...come Jan 20th a lot of people’s moods change because there will be more confidence in the people guiding the ship.

9632,You really can.
9633,I fully agree with everything you've said.

9644,That can't be the excuse everyday it should average out.
9645,It's not improving fast enough.
9646,"&gt; If oxygen ran out, it would typically run out for the entire hospital

Who said it didn't?"
9647,We have incomplete information.
9648,"The hospital administrators are claiming that there was no oxygen shortage, and are also fining a nurse who didn't work during the oxygen shortage."
9649,"All we know is, we don;t know the whole story."
9650,"&gt;and alarms would sound

I watched the video and I heard alarms."
9651,I also saw rushed camera work where I couldn't tell what was going on.
9652,"&gt; with enough time to replenish long before it ran out

Youi know, it's possible they literally didn't have more oxygen."
9653,"Like, the medical supply company ran out of oxygen a week ago and the hospital has been trying to get more but the *region* is having a shortage."
9654,Back in the 1970s there was a gas shortage and people could not drive their cars.
9655,"The fact that cars have gas gages, and also lights that illuminate when the gas level is low, didn't prevent people from running out of gas."
9656,The fact that people had time to get more gas was irrelevant because there wasn't enough gas for everyone.
9657,"&gt;the use of the word ""failure"" implies

Depends on who is using the word and what the word means to them."
9658,If an article is written by a nontechnical person then we shouldn't assume they wrote it with technical rigor.
9659,Also when you can't afford to miss brunch.
9660,Just scheduled my mother to get a coronavirus vaccine.
9661,She's scheduled to recieve it on Sunday here in NYC.
9662,Shes a home health aide.
9663,Thanks to reddit and this subreddit for informing me on how she can recieve it and that its safe.
9664,"Dont go if you have even the slightest doubt, not worth it."
9665,"I'm in Seattle, and they're only talking about returning K-1 in person after March 1."
9666,I asked a neighbor who teaches in the district what he thought.
9667,His answer?
9668,"""They can plan for a return to school all they want."
9669,"Absent a guarantee that they can be fully vaccinated by then and cases continue to decline, most teachers will just apply for exemptions."""
9670,"That makes total sense, and I'm in one of the few areas out west where the numbers are actually slowly declining, too."
9671,So where are those experts predicting 250 deaths / day max.
9672,"As we've said a million times already, they're an isolated island country that has low levels of travel to and from."
9673,"Theyre COVID measures aren't much different than many EU countries that have millions of cases now, so I'm not buying their success in containing COVID has anything other to do with than being being an isolated island that banned travel early."
9674,"Congrats for them, but their success isn't duplicatable for the vast majority of other countries who don't have huge built in natural advantages due to geography"
9675,Spanish the only useful second language.
9676,"Plus, you can order from the taco truck without sounding like a gringo."
9677,No one eats at French restaurants.
9678,"Yes, have you ever used a bunch if gas quickly?"
9679,Like a propane weed burner or propane bbq??
9680,If you keep it on high for long the lines get super cold and frost over.
9681,From what i have read this is what is happening on a larger scale in the hospitals.
9682,For obvious reasons they don’t have bottles of or in the room they have them out of the room serving multiple rooms.

9690,Yes.
9691,"Considering LA is an international city, it's likely already here on that scale."
9692,That’s an interesting approach.
9693,Maybe more would get vaccinated if they had to pay the difference in cost for the extra they would need to do their job safely.
9694,No?
9695,"The government allowed it, they left schools open."
9696,They didn't threaten any serious fines for people fleeing London before moving into tier 4.
9697,"They said ""yeah go on mingle with three other households in Christmas""."
9698,Don't blame this on the people .
9699,Morgues have been reported being full.
9700,I'm wondering if this isn't fully catching up just dredging through backlog.
9701,"No point rushing to process deaths, they're not going to get worse."
9702,I agree in theory but it would be numbing.
9703,"A couple months ago, someone compared this to plane crashes."
9704,"The one thing that makes the world stop and go “OMG”... Covid in the us has been basically 1800 crashes which is about 6 plane crashes per day or one plane crash evert 3 hours....

People have become numb..."
9705,Theres a good chance some of those people at the washington protest have it.
9706,America is about to hit a whole new low unfortunately
9707,Agreed.
9708,Still a better gamble than letting Covid run rampant.
9709,Perfection is impossible when moving at light speed under a microscope.
9710,Lol whoever downvoted you is the reason we are in such situation.
9711,People can fly everywhere and still going on vacations.
9712,Well I am not surprised at all.
9713,The number of health care providers who are split regarding this virus is amazing.
9714,As I mentioned visits from families and other outside individuals would be more concerning as not everyone follows the guidelines of even masks or hand washing.
9715,The reason they isolated nursing home residents was because of visitors bringing in the virus.
9716,Can people with mild symptoms turn for the worse?
9717,?
9718,&gt; The solution is probably to tell everyone with any history at all of allergic reactions that they need to get the vaccine at a hospital or a site approved to respond to anaphylaxis then have everyone else go to the other places.
9719,Exactly!
9720,"In years past, my spouse and I used to get the flu vaccine via one of those work drives tech companies are fond of."
9721,They had you fill out a form upfront to determine whether you'd ever had an allergic reaction.
9722,"If so, they told you they couldn't administer the flu vaccine because they weren't equipped to deal with an emergency due to any adverse reaction."
9723,That’s like saying it’s racist to slander the US or any other country.
9724,"You can’t be racist against a country or state, racism is against a particular people, like racism towards say a Chinese person."
9725,"You can be racist to a person or group of people but not to a country as generally countries are made of a diverse range of peoples

Edit: I believe the term you need is xenophobia not racist"

And we abolished the flu!"
9745,Magic.
9746,"Believe it or not, there are different ways to fight the pandemic."
9747,"The other Nordic countries barely had lockdowns either, and were also quite late with masks."
9748,"Yet, they're some of the best performing countries in Europe."
9749,This doesn't mean there are no measures.
9750,&gt; Your last sentence is crap 1000% though.
9751,"I was thinking about a scenario in which containment measures and lockdowns are insufficient, as during the 1st wave of the Spanish flu."
9752,"If I remember correctly, Covid killed about 0.6% of the population of Bergamo, Italy, during the Spring."
9753,"The outbreak was stopped by a hard lockdown, otherwise more would have died."
9754,"If you take 0.6% of the world population, you easily reach Spanish flu territory, even though only 50% of the population of Bergamo were infected."
9755,I don't think it's possible to distinguish between the transmissibility of a virus and the mortality of the pandemic.
9756,Increased transmissibility will invariably mean more deaths.
9757,"Suicidal behaviour isn't only for angsty teens; and it gets glossed over as just ""angry outbursts"", ""laziness"", ""selfishness"" ""emotionally distant""; there is a noticeable difference between symptoms of metal illness (chronic or acute) willful choice."
9758,Writing it off is lethal.
9759,Supply chain thing perhaps?
9760,Like getting a whole palettes of cows delivered vs a 1 lb package of ground beef 90% fat.
9761,&gt;major portion of that spent in full lockdown.
9762,Really ?
9763,Shutting down few shops and pubs is not lockdown.

9773,"They suggest if he needs a tetanus booster ever again, that he only get tetanus not a combo booster."
9774,He definitely would only receive the Covid vaccine after discussing with his primary and in an office within a hospital.
9775,Epinephrine won’t help a seizure.

9777,"It was confirmed that my dad had the virus  2 days ago(he good) and 2 days ago I got in a car with him, 10 minute travell at less of 1 meter from him and latter that day he showed the symptoms, can someone awnser pls, tomorrow im uncertain if i should go to school or no because there is a chance that i can transmit to my colleges pleasee helppppp!"
9778,it is possible that i have the virus?
9779,"No one is saying that it doesn't affect their wallets nor I'm questioning their dedication and COVID relief efforts, but it sure does not affect their wallets in the same way that it does to me, you, or the vast majority of Americans that just can't afford to not work for weeks/months."
9780,There's gotta be a balance.
9781,"You’re assumption is correct, i don’t know a lot about how it was developed and tested explicitly."
9782,"I look at it similar to deploying a large production application, though it isn’t quite the same it is a process i am familiar with."
9783,"No matter how much a company tries to preempt issues through test-driven development and an army of testers, the real test rolls in post launch."
9784,This is due to the sheer volume of use-cases once it hits public.
9785,"I hear you when you mention the scale of focus, but the expedience and lifted restrictions is the source of my hesitance."
9786,By no means am I rejecting it.

9792,"Agreed, those terrorists are just as bad as the terrorists who rioted and burned down cities just a few months ago."
9793,Crazies on every side of the aisle!
9794,"First of all, you need to consider the delay between test and death, probably a couple of weeks on average."
9795,Then we did have a lot of outbreaks among the elderly in care homes.
9796,And finally you should look at the number of tests per person.
9797,"They are trialling a 2 dose regime but, as with all the current EUA vaccines, I think we can expect to see a good response after one dose."

9813,"This percent is the number of people who test positive for the first time divided by all the people tested that day, excluding people who have previously tested positive."""

9815,"To your second point, I would not be in favor of killing citizens because illegal immigrants are crowding the hospitals."

9817,"As for your first point, I don't believe we are in that situation any longer."
9818,Vaccines should outpace your hypothetical.

9823,It doesn’t set a very good president does it?
9824,I really don’t understand the awards things... well I kinda do in the tech stuff I frequent... like “thank you’s” I guess.
9825,I have received so many bizarre awards in the coronavirus thread that make my head explode with the categories people choose...
9826,I hope it’s it’s just that people are being lazy and pick a low value thing.

9829,Ha
9830,"Generate antibodies, or in the case of severe SARS-CoV-2 infection, may act as inflammatory cells."
9831,Data indicates that you need decent titers of circulating antibodies from the start to prevent reinfection.
9832,Waiting for a B cells response isn't going to prevent at least a base level of reinfection.
9833,"Given how SARS-CoV-2 downregulates type I IFN responses, a small infection can turn into a large infection quickly."
9834,There could also be a legal issue mandating a vaccine when it is only authorized by the FDA under emergency use authorization.
9835,I’m not an expert on that but there could also be a liability and legal issue there for an employer to consider as well.
9836,I would prefer it just be mandated with medical exception but it’s definitely not that easy.
9837,Houston and Harris County and the school districts in same have done a much better job taking this seriously.
9838,When I go into the grocery store and drug store in my neighborhood (Northside) everyone is always masked up.

9841,I don't think that that many cases have not been reported yet.
9842,"Maybe there have been some people that did not get a test although they wanted, but if there were many symptomatic cases without tests, we would have heard, wouldn't we?"
9843,"I think we just lost a lot of cases that would have been asymptomatic and I doubt these cases are very contagious, that's just not how viruses work."
9844,"So IMO the higher rate of positive tests among the fewer actual tests is totally consistent with just testing fewer ""optional"" cases."
9845,"That being said, it is a fucking shame that the government still refuses to even consider effective quantitative monitoring."
9846,"From fewer cameras, fast anonymous antigen tests in public spaces, over canalisation monitoring to random representative tests there is so much one could do to lift the curtain and get some real understanding of the spread."

9884,AZ just voted blue so not everyone
9885,Nowhere in the article does anyone suggest or present evidence that single-dose immunization is worse than no immunization.
9886,It's basically a cautious suggestion that since single-dosers will have lower antibody titers than twice-dosers we can expect them to be less protected than twice-dosers.
9887,"Which is what was expected any way, with the added concern that antibodies produced by the vaccine could be weaker against the South African strain than to the common strain, whether you had one or two doses."

9919,So it’s 10 for every 1million?
9920,I’m so taking the vaccine
9921,They'd only do that if you could convince them that COVID was primarily spread by black people...
9922,"I am choosing to believe that it's a tracking and reporting problem, and not nearly as bad as it seems."
9923,"Illinois hasn't updated the numbers in days, but there are surely a ton of people getting vaccinated."
9924,How about offering that they get to keep their job?
9925,"Happened to a friend of mine in California, in LA."
9926,He lost his taste and smell with a mild dry cough and that's it.
9927,Milder than a cold for him but he did quarantine for 14 days at home ( 52-53 years old I think?)
9928,He told me 2 days ago that his senses are coming back now.
9929,"As a corollary, the way that public health restrictions are unassailable because they're being instituted by ""experts,"" as if public policy making is completely insulated from volatile and oft-irrational public sentiment."
9930,no it can be a treatment not a prevention method.
9931,Not only that but a vaccine also guards you from catching it which is certain.
9932,The vaccine probably stops spread anyway so i do not care
9933,DO NOT GO!
9934,10 minutes in a confined space with a pre-symptomatic is 10 minutes too long.
9935,"Especially with the new UK variant, there's greater chance that you've been infected and either pre-symptomatic or asymptomatic."
9936,You need to wait at least 3 more days and then get a PCR test.
9937,"make it ""minor""."
9938,Sorry I don’t really understand what you’re saying
9939,Blaming anyone but yourself - is that an American trait too?
9940,I got mine the other day.
9941,After all the hype I was expecting to feel sick.
9942,I had minor muscle fatigue for an hour and nothing else happened.
9943,Rather uneventful.
9944,Well except for the CIA van that now follows me around.

9946,This isn't the only mutation of covid-19 It's just for the only one that we're talking about.
9947,"Covid 19 has been mutating the entire time, but until these proteins spike mutations happen they were all insignificantly."
9948,Basically because it's a mutation at the protein spike we should be concerned and it might not really matter if the viral load is much different because the transmission rate is potentially so much higher that you're still going to get a significantly increased mortality rate.
9949,"I mean, in a lot of ways the mortality of covid-19 has never been the main problem, rather the infectiousness so for it to get another boost in an infectiousness is probably worse."
9950,"I think if you could choose between a 70% increase in mortality and a 70% increase in infectiousness you would actually be better off with the mortality since recovered people are still potentially facing long-term symptoms as well and there's the whole fact that it's the infectiousness that shuts down society, not the mortality unless the mortality was so low that it was insignificant."
9951,Getting mortality information on a new variant is going to take quite a bit more time than determining the infectiousness because you know you have to test over a significantly longer time to find out the prognosis of the patient.
9952,What is awful is that Canada’s top down response has resulted in about 27 times as many extra deaths as there were Covid deaths in the under 45 age bracket.
9953,"Yes, inside the nostril but not way up there."
9954,"That's why I said that a ""major portion"" was spent in full lockdown, not all."
9955,Well here there is zero trust in corporations.
9956,I am sure you have seen where corporations have knowingly hid information regarding all sorts of side effects.
9957,Plenty of documentaries out there regarding that.
9958,The fact that in America you can sue for any amount you want.
9959,"However, this vaccine has some agreements that limit liability to the manufacturers."
9960,"Also, most vaccines are not available to the public this quickly, it is usually years."
9961,At least in America this has been authorized for emergency use only current and not approved for use outside of that.
9962,It’s complicated to say the least.
9963,It really isn't money that's driving this.
9964,"It's probably 80% related to the educational experience, where children learn best in person."
9965,"They aren't as well developed as an adult who can take online courses

1."
9966,Kids and computers don't mix.
9967,"Remember computer classes when you were a kid and how often you had your e-mail, shockwave games, Youtube or other things open in parallel?"
9968,Kids WILL get distracted.
9969,"In a classroom, teachers can put an end to note-passing and other distractions, but you can't do it at home."
9970,2.
9971,Children need to interact with other children to learn 'social interactions.'
9972,"There is a narrow time window for children to develop these, similar to how children can only really learn a language (easily) up to a certain age, after which it gets significantly harder
3."
9973,People at the bottom income are at a technical disadvantage.
9974,"They might not have great computers or high-speed internet connections
4."
9975,Children that are not doing well are not going to get the remedial aid they need.
9976,"Normally if someone is struggling or has a question, the teacher will walk over and sit with them for 3-5 mins to do instantaneous tutoring."
9977,This is alot harder over Zoom - you can't easily create side chat rooms to offer that immediate 1-on-1 support.
9978,"And of course, many kids don't want to look stupid so won't raise their hands and get called out in front of everyone."
9979,5.
9980,It's also much harder to do the buddy up with someone to do an exercise option virtually than in person.
9981,I think it gives less of an echo chamber than only allowing people to give positive feedback.
9982,"People get needlessly affirmed, and then do some crazy thing again because of it."
9983,"I have plenty of ""artists"" friends on my facebook who think they sing well because of all the upvotes..."
9984,They do not sing well.
9985,At least having downvotes gives a bit of friction to people who are going down an odd mental path.

9993,I was yelled at for using the same needle to inject Novolog and Lantus.
9994,10 Years later and I still do that.
9995,"Reinfections, regardless of variant, are staggeringly rare."
9996,You should still get the vaccine at some point.
9997,yes the south african variant had the same mutation as the UK strain that was believed to make it more infectious and the south african variant had additional mutations that may make it more infectious especially to youth.
9998,The concern is some of the new mutations are on the protein spike and they're still testing if the vaccine will work on it.
9999,The good news is if the vaccine no longer works it should be a relatively simple process to tweak the existing to work with the new spike.
10000,6 -8 weeks was what I had read.
10001,The bad news is they then are starting over on production and the current doses protect from some but not all variants so they'll need the new shot as well.
10002,Not much different in Europe to be honest.
10003,"They bought vaccines and the some doses got delivered, but they have been sitting in freezers because they are unable to give shots."
10004,"Meanwhile, the UK variant with a higher R is going through the population."
10005,Even hard lockdowns will not stop it.
10006,It seems like 80-90% of the population will get Covid before they get the vaccine.

10020,But is it true that 73 different side effects are more than other vaccines?
10021,What does this even mean?
10022,I was under the impression trials were conducted in countries and results were determined based only from that country.
10023,Are they trying to mix 50% and 91%?
10024,"&gt; Authorities at Brazil’s Butantan Institute, which is helping conduct clinical trials for the Sinovac vaccine, said on Dec. 23 the shot was more than 50% effective, meeting a minimum standard set by U.S. regulators for emergency authorization of Covid vaccines."
10025,"It did not provide details, citing Sinovac’s request to reconcile data across different trials."
10026,"The Brazil trial is Sinovac's biggest so far with some 13,000 participants."
10027,"A trial in Turkey indicated the vaccine is more than 91 percent effective, though it's considered inconclusive as it was calculated from only 29 cases, compared with the 170 found in Brazil."

10032,there is no way for the virus to last 8 months and for some reason it hibernating for most of it
10033,The article does not say the person recording the video was fined.
10034,It says he was arrested according to social media reports.
10035,But not fined.
10036,"You made that part up yourself, and you stated he was fined ""massively""."
10037,"So not only did you make it up, you embellished your own lie."

10046,They literally let random ppl sign up for a pop-up vaccination clinic that was supposed to be open just for frontline &amp; middle-line health care professionals.
10047,They didn't even bother to check credentials at any point in the online sign-up process or even while standing in line to get the shot.
10048,This rollout is such a sh!tshow.
10049,Does this mean people who already had the virus don't need to get vaccinated?
10050,chiros.
10051,You understand how science works right?

10058,"I remember when I was a child people who were older than me used to tell me to not believe everything seen on the internet and now it’s my trying to convince my mother, uncles and aunts to stop believing random stuff they hear about."

10080,"Packed bars, complete disregard for masks, tons of tourism."
10081,As for why its impacting the region so badly: desert climate.
10082,"Cold, dry, and dusty severely weakens the body's ability to fight off infection in the lungs and causes a bunch of coughing/sneezing."
10083,"The harsh sunlight in the summers likely helped disinfect to keep transmission down, but now that its winter they don't have that advantage anymore."
10084,Now the number is up to 850!
10085,"Originally was 600, then was 800, and now 850!"
10086,What number will be next?
10087,Phase three trials of cancer drugs may have about 300 participants.
10088,Sometimes scaling studies up to massive numbers of people prevents you from getting to really look into the details of what you are studying.
10089,"If it passes peer review, that really says something."
10090,I really hope when this is all over all capable countries start sequencing every single sample and sharing it to one central database where these things can be tracked and analyzed.
10091,The technology clearly exists
10092,"Taiwan has 25 million people, way more than New Zealand, and they are also nearly Covid free."
10093,Nah.
10094,"The vaccines will be plentiful enough in very short order to vaccinate citizens first, rest of the world second."
10095,Although that being said it's difficult to determine how much that spike will be due to the increased infectivity of the variant vs increased mixing over the holidays.
10096,Corrupt + Stupid = American
10097,"&gt;It should be  
&gt;  
&gt;solely  
&gt;  
&gt;about saving lives of US citizens

Dumbass."
10098,Leaving high transmission risk undocumented immigrants unvaccinated will kill US citizens.
10099,Which means you are willing to sacrifice your family just so you can feel the self-righteousness of not giving free medication to an illegal.
10100,If it was really solely about saving US citizen lives you would want to vaccinate anyone that can be expected to have contact with a US citizen.
10101,"That's what I'm saying, there doesn't need to have been an asymptomatic carrier, since the first symptomatic carrier worked in frozen imports."

10110,But they're a small island country so it's a lot easier to regulate.
10111,"Maybe the people aren't doing their job of locking down, huh?"
10112,New Zealand truly lives in a different dimension
10113,It’s great and I’m happy for Kiwis to act responsibly but your geolocation helps you quite a lot.

10118,"I am not saying density is the sole driving factor, Japan has more density but have a much more pro mask population."
10119,Japanese are also very nationalistic putting the well being of the nation higher than their individualism.

10121,Couldn't the dementia deaths in July be caused by lockdowns and lack of interaction?

10139,"These are transmission rates that vary between people in geographies, you might be getting a little too precise thinking you're going to get an X and y out of that."
10140,I personally don't find the headline hard to understand.
10141,"Me, my brother, two sisters, my mum and my girlfriend all tested positive for coronavirus back last spring."
10142,"It was like a version of the flu, had a temperature for a few days, out of bed by the third day, and had a bit of a cough that hung around for a week or so."
10143,My girlfriend had no symptoms at all.

10615,Some of the comments here and within the Coronavirus sub generally identify a certain psychology I'd associate with neurosis.
10616,People have fought so hard to both believe that the virus is possibly worse than it is in order to argue against people who deny Covid is a threat and to rationalise their own defensive behaviours towards it they will refuse to accept evidence to the contrary.
10617,This study should be hugely popular and welcomed as good news.
10618,"Instead, it hardly makes the front page because it doesn't fit the prevailing narrative."
10619,"Because until now, the message was that we simply don't know therefore we cannot assume immunity post infection."
10620,"Like Japanese soldiers abandoned on a desert island after the war has ended, there will be people who vehemently insist that the war isn't over- that we still can't be sure immunity will last."
10621,"That is true- we can't be 100% certain, but in order to live life you have to base assumptions on the evidence."
10622,"The evidence is overwhelmingly that there is immunity, instances to the contrary are vanishingly small."
10623,"Finally in defence of the study, it is my understanding that symptomatic reinfection is prevented."
10624,"This means that you can in fact be reinfected, but you will be unlikely to become sick."
10625,Does that mean you cannot die or be sick while infected the second time?
10626,"Well unless being asymptomatically infected infers immortality, no, of course not."
10627,"In fact some deaths occurring in hospital with coronavirus are dying of other illnesses, hence the high rate of deaths in those with comorbidities."
10628,"Covid kills, absolutely."
10629,But SARS-cov-2 can equally infect someone with 5 hours left to live and have virtually no impact on their health while still being counted as a death with covid.
10630,In the UK a death within 28 days of a positive test is counted in the stats.

10744,"Doesn't matter, in a month it'll be true either way."
10745,&gt;I just think you lack the ability to present it in a compelling way that helps policy and you remind me of why we need middlemen in science reporting.
10746,I am only allowed to present certain data that can readily be derived from publicly available information and intuition.
10747,NDAs prevent getting highly specific.
10748,&gt;For you finding reinfections is literally your job.
10749,It biases you to talk about it as you believe it’s both common and important.
10750,It’s all you see.
10751,It's not a bias.
10752,A bias is believing that reinfection is less common than intuition would lead a logical person to conclude.
10753,"For instance, just basing reinfection rates on the number of ""confirmed"" reinfections without taking into account the lack of genetic material to actually run RNA-Seq to confirm it."
10754,I would think that nearly everybody in the scientific community believes knowing about reinfection rates for a disease that has caused havoc globally for over a year is something that's important to know.
10755,&gt;So you say “7% of all documented infections don’t develop antibodies this means reinfection happens and we need to prepare for everything that goes with it” and they say “it’s likely that more than 93% of all cases develop antibodies and are protected for at least 3 months”.
10756,The difference here is that my number (7%) is always going to be a standard.
10757,That 93% may or may not be a standard due to waning immunity.
10758,My only goal here is ending this pandemic without having vaccine escape (which South Africa may have already messed up).
10759,"If we start getting into this habit of saying, ""Oh, if you've been infected once, there's a good chance that you may not be able to get it again,"" people that may have been infected before may start to let their guard down which can lead to reinfection."
10760,Every single reinfection has the potential to lead to another mutation (maybe even more so due to selective pressure from a delayed humoral response).
10761,"It's kind of like the people that have been running around for months now calculating the population mortality rate of the virus rather than the IFR, CFR, or completed case mortality rate and claiming that the virus has a 99.98% survivability rate which is just completely wrong."
10762,"When only one person had died in the US, the population mortality rate was 1 in 328 million (99.9999996%)."
10763,"Now, we've already killed off 0.11% of the population with no clear end in sight to the current wave."
10764,"But still, people will continue to repeat the 99.98% survivability rate until they are blue in the face and in need of a vent."
10765,I'd rather lay things out in a way that makes it known what we are up against.

10791,Yep.
10792,"My BIL is a vet, lives in Texas, and is currently posting pictures of himself hanging out at a bar."
10793,"There are 2500 active cases of covid in his county right now, but he refuses to quarantine at all."
10794,When Covid hit in March he drove across country to see family on the East coast (drove into the infection zone).
10795,When he showed up unannounced at our house I refused to let him in or even open the door.
10796,The government at some point intentionally sabotaged testing efforts to ensure that official case numbers remained below the threshold it had set for harder lockdown measures to be introduced.
10797,"At some point, Poland had a test positivity rate higher than 50%."
10798,"The lies and deception by the government to hide the true death toll make Trump seem honest in comparison, but it worked in so far that outside Poland, the country was hardly ever recognised as a hotspot."
10799,"Meanwhile, if you lived in any major Polish city, it was hard to overlook that half your friends and colleagues got COVID in November."
10800,But can we though?
10801,This rollout is a shitshow.
10802,Where would you suggest it originated then?
10803,Most countries do at least some sequencing and nowhere outside of England has it been found in a majority of the sequenced samples.
10804,Ireland has the second highest prevalence at 25% and this makes sense because they are so close.
10805,Sure it’s possible that it could have originated elsewhere but the U.K. is the likeliest place.
10806,Lmao my brain autocompleted that to veterans.. yea the type of vets you’re talking about do good work
10807,"AFAIK, 74+ are in the next stage?"
10808,Letting our elderly die so that 20-something fast food workers can get the vaccine first is just obscene.
10809,LA county did suspend their ECMO program (probably due to all the ECMO machines are being used by COVID patients).
10810,"So the small number who would have met criteria (persistent v-fibers, and in an ambulance that has a lucas device ), yes potentially life sustaining care is with held for them."
10811,But ECMO program is not the normal standard of care.
10812,It just applies to a couple hospitals that cater to the more affluent areas.

10816,They were really ahead when they made songs about wearing masks and washing their hands.
10817,"Could it be a possibility that people are getting the virus in between the time from known exposure and showing symptoms, and getting it from a different, unknown source?"
10818,"Contact tracing relies heavily on honesty and memory, both of which are inherently flawed..."
10819,I can’t wait to have some immunocompromised people argue we should stay in lockdown until herd immunity.

10882,"Even if 50% of people over 60 died, and 10% of every one else died, Coronavirus wouldn't be a real ""threat to humanity""."

10892,Straight up.
10893,I’m honestly not sure why people are freaking out over this.
10894,Because the type of people most likely who would be “allowed to die” are the ones who are already basically dead.

11285,The WWI participants kept the spread of the Spanish flu secret so as not to compromise military operations.
11286,That's why it wasn't possible to implement containment of lockdowns during the 1st wave.
11287,You can't fight a war with lockdowns.
11288,That's why it was able to spread rapidly in the narrow and crowded space of the trenches and troop transports.
11289,By the time of the 2nd wave it had spread widely and mutated to become very deadly.
11290,"Without containment measures and lockdowns, Covid would be as widespread as the Spanish flu."

11376,Promoting a vaccine regimen that has not been verified  to work could literally cost lives.
11377,And the UK's decision is based on far too little data to be sure that what they are doing will work.
11378,Virologists have also pointed out that this could be extremely dangerous if it turns out that spacing out the injections creates an immunity after the first dose that rapidly levels off.
11379,Because in a worst case scenario that will put selection pressure on the virus that creates a mutant resistant to the first generation of vaccines.
11380,"Should that happen, all the work of the last 12 months will have been for nought, and we can start over by developing a new vaccine."

11398,do obese people deserve to die of preventable disease?
11399,just because it costs too much for us healthy young people to do anything?
11400,Why would selfish Americans do this?
11401,Everyone’s an expert these days.
11402,21-28 days.
11403,"If they could pull off the first 600 doses in such a short period, they can do it in a week easily."
11404,"While I think most, Cases, especially through unknown community transmission is done via aerosol, and I totally agree with you that we don't want things like norovirus and covid, or pinkeye and covid, or the common cold/ flu and covid, I do really believe it is possible that someone that is newly Covid positive touching their nose, mouth or eyes, touching a surface, and then someone who is Covid negative coming along and touching the same surface and then touching their nose, mouth or eyes can and has caused transmission."
11405,"It is not the most likely path, and it does not always happen, but it is the reason we are no longer supposed to shake hands, plus an extra surface."
11406,"That's not really correct, as you'll see similar curves in other countries."
11407,Sweden just assigns those deaths to the correct date instead of counting daily reported deaths.
11408,"I didn't even know there was an alert 1-5, we had tiers which had accompanying rules but that seems to have been jazzed up into an ALERT LEVEL 5 out of nowhere."
11409,Threat of terror in the uk is on a traffic light system so if it gets any worse we might need a whole new system instead of the alert one.
11410,"We could piggyback of the US one, Deathcon 1-5

(I say the last part in jest, stay safe everyone)"
11411,Isn't that even more reason for Americans to wear masks and avoid gatherings?
11412,"52% figure includes data from before the vaccine takes effect, IE days 1-10, if you exclude them and before the second dose is given it rises to close to 90%."
11413,"The UK doesn't actually care that much about the symptomatic covid efficacy either, they care about it's effect on keeping you out of hospital and from dying which is certainly higher than the symptomatic efficacy."
11414,The UK scientists explained their reasoning at the recent press conference.
11415,They are very confident that for both the Pfizer and AZ vaccine dose 1 provides at least 50% effectiveness against keeping you out of hospital and from dying for the 12 week period as a lower bound which justifies the decision if you can double the number of people getting first doses.
11416,It's also not an as complete gamble as some think it is.
11417,We've studied vaccines before and we have lots of data on these vaccines just not every aspect.
11418,Now sure it's a risk but it's not a 50/50 gamble like some people think.
11419,This one has found the solution!
11420,Brilliant!

11432,Good point.
11433,"To deepen the point, that war had conflicts dating from '53."
11434,It was twenty damn years long.
11435,"And Chomsky surmises that the war was lost by '54, so the vast majority of deaths occured after the goal was impossible"
11436,My thoughts exactly.
11437,Today I learned “immediately” has a different meaning in other countries.
11438,"We suspect she has hypermobility, actually."
11439,"She's had issues for years, but when the pain started to become an issue we thought it was RA (her father has it)."

11441,We had to buy a smaller car (we were planning to buy a car for her) and schedule the test in a different town where it was a little easier.
11442,She has a really poor sense of direction.
11443,"You can't just 'let's go right,' to her - you'll have to physically show her which way 'right' is."

11450,"I think there should be wide bands of the population eligible, say 75+ to start."
11451,Then pharmacies can open up reservations.
11452,"Also pharmacies know the age of people who pick up prescriptions, if they have open reservation slots or an extra dose they can just ask the next 75+ year old who comes to get a prescription."

11460,Thank you
11461,"Actually a user on this sub who works as part of a covid immunity team has said there’s reason to believe the covid immunity is at best 93% effective because some people have issues when seroconverting or the like etc 

So basically just take the vaccine"
11462,"He never promised a specific date

He said somewhere within that window is when the corner would be turned but couldn't be more specific than that because these things don't on a reliable schedule"
11463,There are probably individual British hospitals that have more vaccinated employees than France.
11464,Then they should be fired.
11465,Preferably out of a cannon.
11466,"&gt;Interesting read, but did you finish the article?"
11467,Of course I did.
11468,I have researched this extensively.

Yeah, but nothing that would have been more than a blip on the NBC evening news if it had been reported correctly."
11470,"It's not the best vaccine, it's just the cheapest, fastest vaccine to deploy with the most side effects."
11471,Most republicans only like veterans when they’re conservative props.

11473,Hopefully.
11474,You have now been banned from r/coronavirus for spreading dangerous misinformation
11475,"Yes, we did lockdown early and hard, mainly because politics deferred to science."
11476,"While we are an island, we are a big tourist destination and normally have a whole shitload of international flights coming in."
11477,"We have a quite a few tourists who got ""trapped"" here, who are quite happily staying on."
11478,"We have covid scares every now and then, when there is a lapse with managed isolation of returning kiwis, but we are mostly back to normal."
11479,This is actually a conversation I’ve had with a lot of people in my circle.
11480,"Yes I do think people dying is a good idea, including my friends or family."
11481,It would suck if anybody I knew died from this.
11482,"However I think everybody can agree that the human population needs to be reduced, I also think everybody could agree it would suck if they’re family or friends die."
11483,"Ideally, we could of let this virus do it’s thing and a good chunk of people died but were better off as a race, however would you really support that knowing that those closest to you could die?"
11484,I know that I would not.
11485,"I do think that the way this virus behaves is being overhyped by all politicians and media outlets, as a way of keeping us as people scared and leaving power in there hands."
11486,It’s not a crime to not go to work lmao
11487,Yes absolutely.
11488,This will change in the next few weeks and we'll have a shortage of vaccines.
11489,At least they aren't going to reserve half the doses for the second shot (which is absolutely okay according to Drosten) and they'll get 6 shots out of the vaccine bottle instead of 5.
11490,So these initial 1.3 mio doses will end up vaccinating 1.6 mio people instead of 650.000.
11491,Well that's just fucking tremendous
11492,It's supposed to wake up call to the flag waving folks on the far right who are being negligent in stopping the spread of covid 19.
11493,At this point they are about a thousand layers deep in the conservative fantasy world inception and I don't think this latest frying pan across the face is going to disturb their slumber one iota.
11494,Yeah.
11495,But it doesn’t matter.
11496,It’s a shitty platform for a pandemic.
11497,"And...

There’s no one to man it as the military has been deploying “spare” doctors and nurses across the country for months now."
11498,LA is a city with very shallow and selfish people.
11499,"Shouldn’t it be easier to vaccinate 8,000,000 people in 10 square miles, as opposed to 2,000,000 in 20,000 square miles?"
11500,"I’m talking vaccines per capita, obviously."
11501,"Higher than being outdoors in the summer, not higher than being indoors"
11502,It's not racist to call out a massacre.
11503,You are delusional.
11504,Which I feel is a demonstration that the tier system isn't entirely necessary.
11505,The availability of doses is not the bottle neck it was expected to be.
11506,It seems like we'll have over a hundred million doses out within the next month or two.
11507,I don't think we need to be rationing it out by occupation the way we are now.
11508,"With those absurd exemptions and the fucked up rollout of the vaccines, Germany really is a shitshow right now."
11509,Thats just embarassing.
11510,"“Fuck the nursing homes, and I want the vaccine now!”"
11511,Just staff an MD and a few RNs?
11512,Do you think they aren’t thinking of that?
11513,Who do you think is treating covid patients and has been running themselves ragged since March?
11514,"Pharmacists are a more practical group, and there aren’t enough of them either."
11515,In the last couple of weeks 46 states have approved pharmacy technicians to receive additional training and be approved to deliver covid vaccinations.
11516,But that training is over 10 hours additional hours on top of the busiest time of the year for pharmacy.
11517,State boards should have approved techs and other lower level people ages ago so they could assist in larger settings.
11518,"The problem is that there just aren’t enough people qualified to do the jabbing, and it’s not easy to get people qualified."
11519,"Yes, get those shots in arms of willing recipients."
11520,We'll never get this done if we labor over who is the most deserving to get it today vs next week vs next month.
11521,Like they would have found anything anyway.
11522,It's been a year.
11523,Any incriminating evidence is likely burned or dead.
11524,Fascinating article by the way.
11525,100% worth reading even if you’re skeptical of the title.
11526,Apparently in your small mind world.
11527,You’ve never seen people who have lived in multiple countries.
11528,"And get this.. was even born in South Africa 🤯
Do you know where that is?"
11529,That sounds correct but I really doubt it actually is.
11530,Where is that?
11531,I find in general people don't really raise their military service unless the discussion is about work history.
11532,"&gt;posts article and video supporting a viewpoint basically only China supports

Because China's telling the truth, and the proof (and I don't mean evidence, I mean *proof*) is there if you want to see it."
11533,"The fact that the mainstream media still loves to talk about the ""Tiananmen Square massacre"" shows how deep Sinophobia runs in Western journalism, Western government, and Western culture."
11534,"They had local transmission just as much as we did here in canada at the time, no lock down."
11535,360k*
11536,So... not immediately then.
11537,&gt;I really dont know what you are trying to say it wasnt meant to be deployed population wide.
11538,"I've reviewed the primary source material, listened to the editor-in-chief of NEJM's analysis of the data in front of the FDA, and the responses from the study's PI."
11539,"They explicitly excluded people with severe allergies (not specific, as you claim) and enrolled age cohorts that are non-representative to the population currently receiving the vaccine."
11540,Their reasoning was they originally intended for the vaccine to be deployed to a limited population (health care providers) and did not expect it to be deployed population-wide at this stage of research.
11541,The CDC pushed for that.
11542,"Anaphylaxis generally occurs swiftly after exposure, but it can also take hours, sometimes 24 hours, to occur."
11543,"As I stated earlier, you don't have to believe me call your allergist."
11544,"If you don't have an allergist, then what are you basing your information on?"
11545,"Your opinion, your common-sense, what you've read in the media?"
11546,"I have two children who suffer from nut allergies and I have had to do more than a deep dive into the topic, have accompanied them in the office for food challenges, and have lengthy conversations with other doctors in the office regarding the limits of our knowledge regarding allergies, interactions with one's environment, and the utility of epi pens (or lack thereof) in an acute emergency."
11547,"The short version of that is epi pens get you to the hospital, they aren't substitutes for treatment and the subsequent observation required to fully assess someone is out of the woods."
11548,"Again, read the primary source material."
11549,If you don't have a representative sample of 70 year old people enrolled in your study you can't say it was intended for 70+ year old recipients.

11551,Seriously it’s a massive national security threat.
11552,That can and will be used as leverage in future disputes.
11553,Seems pretty standard across most of the country.
11554,40-60% of healthcare workers are refusing the vaccine

11556,that is also why.

11571,In Germany we have 2/3 of Japans Population and we use at least 5 fax machines for our covid numbers
11572,Bro...I knew you were 12 based on your Kyle Lowry reference but maybe try to think about the things you say
11573,Good for them.
11574,General strike would be supported.
11575,No one should be working in unsafe conditions and this pandemic is creating unsafe conditions.
11576,Besides distance learning works.

Anecdotally speaking I know a good amount of healthcare workers who aren’t vaccinating because “they don’t trust it”."
11580,"Wait, but isn't leaving the free market untouched the best for everyone?"

11588,Dude don’t take this so personally.
11589,"You like a lot of Americans don’t have any real concept of what obesity looks like, it’s ok. 

R/loseit"
11590,So you agree with my statement that it is possible for more than one entity to be a problem?
11591,"“The unending pandemic has also been good for ratings, a common pattern at cable news networks during wars and mass shootings”"
11592,"Just a friendly reminder for next time, because this helped me remember after years of using them interchangeably myself

E.g."
11593,"= Example given

I.e."
11594,= In other words
11595,I think the one thing that will make the most difference is well-qualified people being put in place to run federal agencies that are related to the response to the virus.
11596,The current administration seems to have chosen people that are deliberately anti-government to run them and has under funded and subverted them.
11597,"Our government, science, and health care institutions are imperfect but are needed at a time like this."
11598,The 2nd most important thing IMHO is just communication with the public.
11599,What we are seeing now is a lot of concerned people all being left up to their own devices and to make their own decisions at the state and even county or neighborhood level.
11600,There is no leadership and no guidelines and most importantly almost no flow of information.
11601,People get their information about the virus and vaccine from Facebook.
11602,They should instead be getting it from the government and experts.
11603,The current administration seems to have taken delight in eliminating all normal sources of information dissemination with the public and replaced it with one Twitter account.
11604,The new white house will hold regular press briefings and help to inform and align people on common goals.
11605,They will also be in touch with governors and mayors of large cities around the country and help them to get what they need and use federal resources to do so.
11606,Leadership matters.
11607,China didn't really have a hard lockdown outside Hubei.
11608,Some parts like Guangdong got away with a lockdown as light as Germany's or even lighter.
11609,"Most people in this sub also have no clue what European countries have done, to be fair."
11610,"I mean, reading things like ""they just didn't lockdown hard enough"" makes my blood boil."
11611,"Eh, not saying it couldn't have made a big difference but nothing is so cut and dry."
11612,"The right messaging combined with a very different approach to supporting the economy/working people would have produced much better results, sure, especially over the summer."
11613,"Much like Europe and most of the rest of the world though, I don't think the US was ever in a position to completely stamp it out like NZ, Taiwan or even China."
11614,That’ll teach ‘em!
11615,"Which was also related to the pandemic in terms of its scope and severity, though."
11616,Lot of people had the time and energy to protest that they did not have in 2019.
11617,EMTs would be giving injections regularly already?
11618,But they are probably too busy to be taken off emt duties
11619,Lol
11620,It is also absolutely easier to control the spread in isolated countries.
11621,That's something this sub fails to accept for some reason.
11622,"Ok, but try being the parent of both a 9th and 12th grader..."
11623,"Lucky, it sucks in America."
11624,Still in full lockdown.
11625,Its been 10 months.
11626,"I get that you don’t like Trump, but other countries have had similar difficulties dealing with COVID."
11627,Oh.
11628,You’re just playing a game of dipshit gotcha.
11629,I’ll choose to ignore you.
11630,That’s not what the article says at all.
11631,[removed]
11632,I think what troubles me is that these should be the 'easy' groups.
11633,"While experts have cautioned people to not assume the vaccine has an impact on spread, it’s reasonable to assume it does reduce transmission."
11634,"It’s just that the vaccines aren’t being tested for that, only stopping people from getting sick."
11635,So scientists can’t say for sure if these specific vaccines do stop the spread.
11636,"This is the ""15 days"" quote:

&gt;Dominique  Le Guludec, head of France's medical regulator, said there was still  insufficient data to approve the AstraZeneca vaccine developed by Oxford  University and AstraZeneca."
11637,"&gt;  
&gt;""We prefer to wait another 15 days if necessary to have all the data we need on safety and efficacy,"" Le Guludec told BFM TV."

11639,"Planning to eventually get a vaccine doesn’t deter Covid, unfortunately."
11640,Then politicians should wait to push schools to open until teachers are actually vaccinated.
11641,Pushing them to open NOW all all times is just stupid and hypocritical.
11642,"Not only that, but “affluent” individuals across the globe are traveling to the US to be vaccinated."
11643,"lol, sorry, but i feel your pain"
11644,They do benefit from geographical isolation along with the advantage of being a relatively small country compared to somewhere like Australia.
11645,Getting to the shops and movement of people doesn’t help stop transmission though
11646,Loneliness
11647,The high schools and colleges I'm familiar with are all case by case.
11648,Some were planning on opening but are backing off now that cases are rising again.
11649,Some are offering part time on-site like 2 days a week or certain classes.
11650,I think it is difficult because a huge part of the high school and college experience is being on site and spending time with other kids.
11651,I know a lot of high school and college students who can't stay focused or motivated doing everything online and their mental health is suffering as a result.
11652,They are in a weird kind of unstructured limbo.
11653,I hope that some are able to get back to some kind of in-person situation soon.
11654,They admit in the article that they talk about Coronavirus more because it’s good for ratings.
11655,Obviously they don’t want Coronavirus to end because then they have to go back to doing stories about a bear getting stuck in a tree at a state park.
11656,You can’t compare New Zealand to the US.
11657,With the massive amount of community spread going on in the US the only way to fix it is a HARD lockdown for the next month.
11658,The US doesn't have any way to institute that at a national level.
11659,Then why aren't you helping if it's so easy for you?
11660,That's like putting out a kitchen fire and calling it a day when there's still a glowing ember drifting around
11661,"they are hiding and waiting, dont worry.. china employs thousands of people to be ''internet trolls'' for money, some even for free"
11662,A handful of local cases per day in the whole country and no deaths for several weeks isnt reined in?
11663,And all those dead folks?
11664,Hello loneliness ;(
11665,It's not xenophobic to want answers to arguably the the worst human event in the last 70 years.
11666,I do not think this virus was leaked from a lab.
11667,But that still doesn't mean we can't learn valuable information from a transparent investigation.
11668,"Yep, because in his mind causing another US civil war is a better alternative to him going to jail for his numerous crimes."
11669,:(
11670,There was a nursing shortage before covid19.
11671,And right now the entire country is slammed.
11672,As in so desperate that some cities and states are letting nursing students try to fill in the gap.
11673,"It’s good that DeSantis is doing this, but I just don’t think the odds are in Florida’s favor right now."
11674,It's like we learned nothing from watching Italy go through this last March.
11675,We really are stupid in the US.
11676,I don’t think anyone has said it’s being blown out of proportion.
11677,Keep up public pressure.
11678,Why cant they use welding oxygen?
11679,[deleted]
11680,What do you mean by no in person check ups?
11681,Districts send the police department to homes of students who fall off the grid to do wellness checks.
11682,2/3rds of the vaccine in California are sitting in freezers.
11683,Wtf is going on?
11684,Newsom is incompetent.
11685,People need vaccines now.
11686,People are dying and California knew the vaccine was coming yet did nothing to prepare.
11687,They need to be giving mass vaccinations to people
11688,Unless the AZ is proven to be “around the same level” as the mRNA vaccines I don’t see any chance of if being approved.
11689,People taking it would feel as if taking a second class vaccine.
11690,Even though I'm home all the time it is weirdly hard to get anything done or get motivated.
11691,Even working from home it's hard to keep a schedule.
11692,Dishes and laundry pile up even though I'm home all the time.
11693,"Yes, it is weird."
11694,I am trying to make a point of getting out of the house for at least 30-45 minutes every day even if it's just to take a walk.
11695,To be fair anti maskers don’t fear becoming infected...because they’re selfish morons but still.
11696,You really don’t understand how these things work do you?
11697,Why do you think this crisis is worse here than almost anywhere in the world?
11698,It starts at the top.
11699,This is why we have a CDC.
11700,He teamed up with Fauci for a massive fight against AIDS in Africa.
11701,They are heroes in that continent.
11702,Guy that took the photos was arrested.
11703,The city of London by itself has twice the population of the entire country of New Zealand and is 170 times smaller.
11704,The UK is automatically disqualified from being a fair comparison based on that alone.
11705,"I don't understand why nobody is taking population density in to the account when talking about NZ, it's astounding."
11706,"Christ, the TOWN I live in is literally 42x more dense than NZ."
11707,This virus travels more than I have in the last decade.
11708,If you're worried about Covid just get tested.
11709,The 3 day tests are widely available.
11710,"https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/news/update-rolling-review-astrazenecas-covid-19-vaccine

Statements made by the director of the Danish medical agency: https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-9102239/Why-Britain-country-approve-Oxfords-Covid-jab.html"
11711,"I guess because a bunch of people said this is real and I should take it seriously and it’s not just the media blowing it out of proportion, even though the media is now literally admitting they blew it out of proportion to boost ratings."
11712,[removed]
11713,"It reduces symptoms by lowering viral load, from what I understand."
11714,You just made my throat dry just reading that.
11715,"Many families in my area are forming ""pods"" of like-aged kids."
11716,They all get tested and then just decide to spend time with one another and bear the consequences.
11717,Think of it as an extended family.
11718,This gives the kids built-in playmates and friends and helps the parents to share the load.
11719,It appears people wearing mask cuts down the spread of other diseases like the flu and colds.
11720,"If people wore masks in the USA, Donald Trump would have won re-election."
11721,It's a strange world.
11722,"University of Rochester has done an awesome job of distributing the vaccine- has gotten 14k employees vaccinated in the past three weeks, and all patient facing and in person staff have been offered."
11723,Getting dose 2 next week!
11724,Oh that is awful.
11725,Have had a loved one in both of those hospitals recently.

11739,What about tranquilizer darts from a tranquilizer gun but instead of tranquilizer it’s the vaccine?
11740,"Not that it really matters in the grand scheme, but is there a chance that this could be not true?"
11741,"I got my first dose on Saturday, and when I was standing in line at my NYC hospital, there were doctors and nurses in the same line talking about how they were there for their 2nd dose."

11748,"I don't want to play devils advocate here, but I just want to point out that Vietnam and Liberia probably don't have accurate numbers."
11749,It's like trusting China?
11750,Not to mention Liberia especially is in Africa which has reported low numbers overall right now (besides SA).
11751,"As for Finland, comparing to them is completely irrelevant."
11752,I don't really understand why you would compare to Finland considering they do consistent trade with the EU on a daily basis.
11753,These extreme symptoms like stokes and brain damage are extremely rare.
11754,Yes it is scary but only about 1% of people get sick from the virus and a tiny minority of those people get these crazy symptoms.
11755,They make the headlines but are rare.
11756,"Something drastic has already happened, we have a &gt;90% effective vaccine available to the public."
11757,Just need to ride this out for the next 6 months while everyone gets vaccinated.
11758,How?
11759,That was pretty straight forward to me.
11760,https://wgntv.com/news/coronavirus/biden-says-it-will-take-years-to-vaccinate-american-people-at-current-pace/
11761,"Biden's comment was that *at the current pace of vaccinations*, it would take years to vaccinate everyone in the country."
11762,This was just based on the slow pace of the initial rollout and simple math.
11763,"If we vaccinate 100,000 per day and the population is 330 million then that adds up to 9 years."
11764,His point is that we need to go faster and I think we will.
11765,The flu vaccine is given to 1-2 million people per day nationwide so we can do a lot better.
11766,I don't want to make this political but the current administration seems to have completely checked out and so there is no leadership.
11767,Hopefully that will change shortly.
11768,They're saying to take a lot of precautions and only do what is essential—they don't expect people to not leave their home for any reason.
11769,OP: why did you post an incredibly outdated article that doesn’t even address the question it poses?
11770,This is not good news.
11771,It’s just a headline that may not even be as true as it was in April.
11772,"I'd put strong money on a 2nd COVID stimulus bill that includes $2k relief checks and money for hospitals, state/local governments, and vaccine distribution."
11773,It's almost entirely what the 2 winning candidates in Georgia ran on.

11789,Couldn't rocket grade liquid oxygen be used in hospitals?
11790,"I don't know if it's any different/less pure than medical grade, but the rocket industry doesn't seem to be suffering from liquid oxygen shortage."
11791,"From a quick Google search: 

* 1 liter of liquid oxygen (LOX) = ~860 liters of gaseous oxygen (GOX)."
11792,"[[1]](http://asmameeting.org/asma2013_mp/pdfs/asma2013_present_138.pdf)

a bit more but let's assume a worse version.)"
11794,"[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falcon_9)

11804,"Yep, happened at my work."
11805,"Told us when they would start, and then made us wait in the hallway for over an hour while the WFH admins, admins families, and even some of their friends got the vaccine first."
11806,"After they did them, they did about 15 of us staff members before they went on break."
11807,"Mind you, the CVS clinic people did not need a break, but the building admins made them shut down in case something happened and they would be bothered on their lunch break."
11808,"It felt like a big slap in the face when they made us wait for them while we are the ones face to face with patients, we are the ones who have been risking our health during the whole pandemic."
11809,"Not to mention, nurses and aides having to swap out in line because they were still taking care of patients during this."
11810,does a vaccine stop you from spreading the virus ?
11811,There's nothing worth reporting on with the nurse until we know what killed her.
11812,Literally no information has been released.
11813,Could be a heroin OD for all we know.
11814,This is from April.

11818,Taiwan has some of the highest density cities in the world.

11821,"When Taiwan went through their second wave, they responded by shutting down Christmas markets and New Years concerts."
11822,They reinstituted temperature checks before entering shopping malls and strict limits on tourist areas.
11823,"As a result, the second wave ended at 1 total cases."

11831,Shit's rough.
11832,[removed]
11833,Probably not for a little while longer for a few reasons.
11834,1.
11835,It's still unclear how much the vaccine reduces transmission.
11836,It likely does reduce transmission but is is a 95% reduction or a 60%?
11837,"If it's only a 50% reduction, it still may require those vaccinated to wear masks."
11838,Until a significant portion of the population is vaccinated it would be wise to continue to wear masks.
11839,2.
11840,The percent of people vaccinated is currently very small relative to the percent of people who would claim they are immune/vaccinated to get out of wearing a mask.
11841,Many places will not find it worth it to try to verify vaccination yet.
11842,Again as a large fraction of the population is vaccinated this issue will be smaller.
11843,"Yes, a vaccine in someone's arm is better than one sitting in a freezer."
11844,"At this point just get it out to everyone, that is going to help way more than only giving it to the highest risk population first while the general population continues to spread Covid."

11856,I’ve been 300 days in essential outings only.
11857,You are absolutely correct.
11858,Trump is just a symptom of the disease that is our broken political system.
11859,China virus found in all over the world
11860,My point is these vaccines will be wasted if not used.
11861,Why not get money into the hospital so the hospitals can keep running?
11862,End of the day we need as many people vaccinated as possible.
11863,With hospitals having more resources they can do more.
11864,If they can gather extra resources by giving the extra doses in the vials to rich people donating large sums of money I see this as a win win.
11865,Hospital gets money people get vaccinated.
11866,And if the healthcare workers are going to refuse it might as well get it to someone who will use it.
11867,Lock down the US in January?
11868,The first case of diagnosed COVID in Italy was January 31st.
11869,I'm glad you're not in charge of policy.
11870,"We will learn from this, because the UK will probably be the first to detect every new strain , after the first 30 or so people will have to think of some new names!"
11871,The vibe at my school is everyone wants to shut it down for the rest of the year and then get the vaccine and then come back in the fall on hundred percent.
11872,That would be the smart and rational thing to do.
11873,"Which means of course we're going to ignore that, continue to do hybrid, continue to go back and forth and continue to cost lives"
11874,Gesundeit
11875,Oh yeah worldwide it's more complicated.
11876,I was thinking just within US or other western countries.
11877,That would be too blatant and obvious
11878,"Perhaps you should look up the word, and what it is?"
11879,No!
11880,You don't say?!?!?
11881,Who would've guessed?!?!?
11882,/S
11883,That would be my guess.
11884,"Not sure we will ever know the true story, but man China looks bad and getting worse."
11885,I disagree.
11886,Considering the recent variant and highly infectious viruses circling the wagons?
11887,and America unable to lockdown?
11888,Nay.
11889,"You should still wear a mask in public as long as your health officials say so which, my guess, would be until all the vulnerable and old are vaccinated but who knows."
11890,"I agree, except that I'm not so sure that straightforward deaths from covid will be higher."
11891,"Deaths from starvation in poorer countries alone could end up being more than covid deaths, see, e.g., https://time.com/5917347/world-food-programme-hunger-covid-19/"
11892,"In this case that googling should in part do the opposite as you imply, because he spent years engaging in research of the very topic of biosecurity."
11893,"The dude as well has an odd side hustle in erotica, but implying that that necessarily impinges upon this topic is indeed ad hominem."
11894,People have weird interests which do not disqualify them from sober analyses in other realms.
11895,"It's one thing to ""check for bias"" and another to engage in implied blanket dismissal over that putative bias."
11896,Attending a holiday gathering is a decision one can easily not do.
11897,I think it’s important to qualify what you said with that.
11898,People who did attend were selfish assholes.
11899,If after nine months you don’t understand the significance of your behavior during a pandemic then I’m you are just willfully ignorant.

11901,"The president is an absolute icon among ""the various ""alternative thinking"" groups - people who belive in assorted insanities from alternatice medicine to outright supernatural powers."
11902,Those people consider his stunts with testing fruit to be the basic evidence that the whole covid is a hoax and think that Tanzania is the paradise on Earth.
11903,"I would really wish all of them moved there, but I honestly think that they would not even be welcome."
11904,"[According to German media](https://www.zeit.de/wissen/gesundheit/2021-01/moderna-corona-impfstoff-ema-eu-behoerde), 1.5m doses ""over the next weeks"" for Germany with an unspecified number in the first delivery next week."
11905,Thanks for the hope internet stranger :)
11906,What a smart statement.
11907,Excellent article.
11908,Thanks for posting.
11909,Okay show me a country similar to the US that has handled covid amazingly
11910,"Well in April when this was written, they didn't know why..."
11911,"Populations:

Switzerland: 8.6M
Hungary: 9.6M
Austria: 9M
Italy: 60M
Bulgaria: 6.9M

Israel: 9.1M
Czech Republic: 10.7M

*USA: 332M*

I've said for half a year now that per-capita comparisons are only useful if populations are within 1 order of magnitude."
11912,"Meaning the US can be compared in good faith against countries with population of at least 33M... *maybe* 10M, depending on which definition of ""order of magnitude"" one uses."
11913,"In other words, the *only* country on your list that you can compare against in good faith is Italy, and maybe Czech Republic."
11914,"It’s also a tiny island with the population of 4.5 m.

For comparison the US is 37 x bigger per land mass."
11915,Not an island.
11916,NZ has a population comparable to Louisiana.
11917,Very happy for them of course.
11918,Less death is a good thing.
11919,But people saying “Why can’t the US be like NZ?” It’s just not a logical comparison.
11920,And that's the problem.
11921,Wait until you might need medical attention some day and someone has bought a space in front of you.
11922,You're clearly someone who has to experience something to understand it.
11923,I think that too
11924,You make good points.
11925,People think New Zealand or Taiwan are applicable to continental Europe or the US
11926,That also... you’re right
11927,"I’m nearly sure it’s serious, care to explain why you think that?"
11928,They are staffed by the ghost of Florence nightingale
11929,"Damn, that must be frustrating"
11930,"They paid more taxes and made more contributions to our society, therefore they should get vaccines sooner."
11931,People that mooch off welfare should be put to the back of the line.
11932,"Your comment has been removed because

11939,"Teachers are the best people, I am really embarrassed for how i was in 7th grade myself, puberty is crazy...

Hopefully your students and you don't get infected..."
11940,Y’all keep blaming tourists but tourists don’t protest the lockdown at the indoor shopping mall.
11941,I’m pretty sure if locals were following public health guidance irrespective of tourists (which are limited now since most things aren’t supposed to be open and if they are open then it’s locals who are bringing tourists in) then SoCal would be like NorCal
11942,[removed]
11943,"Yeah, no physical borders in EU either (well, Schengen and co), and like I said in my comment, north of Finland is similar, but helped by the fact there are maybe ""only"" 20 roads because the area is so sparsely populated."
11944,But it might be the only feasible option if there's a pandemic that we can't make a vaccine for.
11945,"Obviously, setting up a border fence or whatever doesn't make sense, but checkpoints for main highways, aerial control, fines for breaking it when you're find to be in a state you don't reside in.. Maybe it is completely impossible, but saying we should imitate Aus/NZ/Thailand/etc means we would have to do that."
11946,The South African variant had better catch up
11947,what percentage of them were over the age 65?
11948,Here's the other piece of good news for the day.
11949,I know this isn't a political sub but the Democrats just took control of the Senate.
11950,They (along with even some Republicans) have been increasingly critical of the administrations vaccine rollout.
11951,There will likely be some measure passed by congress now that at least throws money at the vaccine problem and potentially does more.
11952,We also have three more vaccines on the way
11953,"And thats why my kids school has a shortage of teachers, and now one of her classes has 37(!)"
11954,kids in it apparently.
11955,And this is probably just the aftermath of Christmas gatherings... Not looking good for the aftermath of New Year’s celebrations.
11956,It’s... frustrating to say the least.
11957,"People, everywhere: the better we ALL comply with the safety measures, the sooner we’re all out of this mess."
11958,"You realize every time there's an article here about Europe, it's swarmed by Americans going ""WELL AKSUALLY IN AMERICA IT'S WORSE""?"
11959,I'm not sure I'm following your point right now.
11960,I look around the country and I see no shortage of long lines at vaccination spots when they get opened up to the population at large.
11961,"You put out the word that ""Vaccinations will be available to anyone 70 or over at X park from 8:00 AM to 4:00 PM"" and you'll get a line  blocking up traffic 9 blocks away."
11962,I don't think the current groups are the easiest.
11963,"Only the largest nursing homes are going to draw more folks than your average ""vaccination drive"" (the park example from above) line."
11964,And this is to say nothing of the paperwork involved in the process.
11965,"If all it takes is an age to verify eligibility, it will remove much of the bureaucratic burden."
11966,"I guess bottom line: If you think vaccinations are going to slow down, you're wrong."
11967,They're getting faster and they will continue to get faster.
11968,"There's a lot of reasons for that, but moving down the line in priority groups isn't going to make it harder, I can assure you of that."
11969,It's important to keep tally of how bad things are getting.
11970,"Yes, Bolsonaro is more dangerous than Trump, because he doesn't care about human rights, lives of people or the forests and roughly 1/3 of brazilians think like our bovine friend NishVar here, so he has a real chance (a favorite even IMO) of being reelected up to 2026."
11971,"While Trump was just a rich and very powerful guy, Bolsonaro represents ""christian values"", meaning: anti-gay, anti-aborption, death to all those who endanger the lives and customs of good christians, including not only criminals but also forest-protecting natives who are ""too lazy to actually work""."
11972,"Bolsonaro also defends the rich companies, and it turns out many people don't really care about what is going on or how many will die as long as jobs are created/kept, and he is seen as a ""job protector""."
11973,"Finally, our state (Brazil) isn't as solid as US, so while we are still a true Democracy, there is a chance he makes a coup."
11974,"Polictical opposition to him is very scattered and can't agree on anything amongst them, Justice is also historically elitist and easily bribed, the only opposition strong enough as him currently here is Globo (our main broadcast company, corrupt by its own but at least does the right thing regarding him or the pandemic)."
11975,"If he ever manages to shut down Globo, that is the moment Brazil will be doomed to become Venezuela, when I should leave my job and whatever I have here to become a refugee somewhere else."
11976,"As someone who currently lives in Asia, I'm still surprised you guys are still debating whether to wear masks or not."
11977,Everyone's been wearing masks over here like 1 year ago....
11978,The Spanish Flu caused 50 million deaths worldwide in one year despite masks and social distancing.
11979,COVID has caused 1.87 million deaths worldwide so far and I doubt the number is gonna be higher than 3 million when the pandemic is over.
11980,People often mention how disingenuous it is to compare COVID to the Flu...and the same applies to comparing it with the Spanish Flu or Ebola which are way deadlier than COVID and warrant a different type of societal response.
11981,"If a new Ebola strain kept its mortality rate but was as contagious as COVID, even the most avid COVID anti-maskers would be complying and sh\*\*\* their pants."
11982,"For the most part, non-clinical departments are administering the vaccine."
11983,There's plenty of clinical staff in non-clinical roles.
11984,It is a good amount of labor but it's pretty doable.
11985,I bet they preferred when it was the Chinese virus...
11986,They exist.
11987,"I wish this weren't true, but they absolutely exist."
11988,:(
11989,Slave labor v 6.0.
11990,"But they don’t get empathy, they are just the gears"
11991,NYC isn't an island nation
11992,"So once I get the vaccine, I don't have to wear a mask anymore, right?"
11993,"We are behaving exactly as we did during the 1918-1921 flu pandemic: i in Brighton’s about mask wearing, disinformation, politicizing public health guidance, protesting masks, ... its largely identical to how we behaved 100 years ago"
11994,[archive link for anyone who has trouble accessing the article ](https://archive.vn/0eYaJ)
11995,"There’s been reports that covid 19 mutates much more slowly, as compared to the flu virus, and when it does mutate it isn’t far off from the original virus...which is why it was so easy (relatively) to develop a vaccine for and why the vaccine is projected to be effective against most mutations seen to date."
11996,People really aren’t understanding states rights and the limitations of the federal government during Covid.
11997,Fact check: this article cites no sources other than the mayor of Broward.
11998,"The mayor cites no sources, saying it's a ""matter of math""."
11999,He doesn't provide the math.
12000,Why not both?
12001,The WHO sucks.
12002,China sucks.
12003,the death toll was higher too.
12004,Remains to be seen.
12005,But really isn’t that the function of vaccines.
12006,If you’re not getting sick you’re not spreading it.
12007,Not everyone!!
12008,Some of us are still careful and it’s wearing on us seeing half the country just not care.
12009,"No, you *probably* wouldn’t spread it."
12010,It’s just that that hasn’t been tested because that’s not the purpose of the vaccine but it’s very likely it prevents spread anyway.
12011,"If you want to roll the dice on your 15% risk, be my guest."
12012,"The vast majority of people in the US getting the vast majority of vaccines have minimal risk of exposure to the virus the vaccine is for in the first place, but we take vaccines because even small risk reduction is worthwhile."
12013,We buckle up seatbelts despite going years without accidents for the same reason.
12014,We have two pilots in plane cockpits for the same reason.
12015,"I’d say the risk of having a severe case of coronavirus is higher than me being in a fatal car crash, yet still I buckle up."
12016,Go figure.
12017,"See my comment here below --  ignore the lazy ad hominem, the author's only role was martialing the facts into a compelling narrative."
12018,"Those facts within the article are not disputed, which is why the only response you're seeing are appeal to \[lack\] of authority and ad hominem rather than good faith engagement with the strong battery of circumstantial evidence at our disposal."
12019,Right now we have healthcare workers refusing the vaccine and no one else getting it.
12020,I don’t think it’s a problem to get money into hospitals if it means someone gets vaccinated.
12021,More vaccinated is better than less.
12022,"No, 4-6 weeks according to Pfizer."

12028,Honestly don't forget a lot of this sub reddit too.
12029,Border control/closure is one of controlling a spread of a disease.
12030,"I hope you guys are smart enough not to assume if country does xxx and it works, we must do xxx to a T.

***Watch and learn where strategies worked and where they failed, improve from there***."
12031,"If we use this mindset instead, I'm pretty sure most would agree there are tons to improve on from this pandemic."
12032,Like we learn limiting air travel without mandatory quarantine arrivals and testing doesn't work.
12033,(UK and South Africa strain).
12034,Definitely something the most economically powerful country can do.
12035,"We learn having an updated stockpile of essential supplies, PPE, equipment and no critical infrastructure should be based overseas."
12036,Definitely something the most economically powerful country can do.
12037,"(Role models: Taiwan and South Korea)

We learn having well equipped and funded contact tracing departments can greatly reduce spread of infections."
12038,"(Role models: South Korea and Singapore)

We learn if we force businesses and schools to undergo lockdowns, we can reducing the impact of economic impact by having generous social safety nets."
12039,"(Role models: Australia and Canada)

We learn we should best support our health authorities and not attack them."
12040,"(Role models: South Korea, New Zealand and Finland)"
12041,SF was under very strict lockdown in March and April what are you talking about?
12042,There was.
12043,It was called the pandemic playbook and Obama created it after an Ebola scare on us soil.
12044,"Trump, Jared, and Ivanka wiped their asses with it and tossed it in the recycling bin on their first day in the White House."
12045,And why should they?
12046,If local government says it’s not considered safe to go to the field museum even with a mask on or even eat a sandwich indoors for a 1 hour lunch why would it be safe to be indoors in a small classroom and attempt to teach effectively for an 8 hour school day?
12047,This is just post Holiday reporting.
12048,The numbers have been down the past few weeks because a lot of people took time off from work.
12049,Well they don't listen so you're the best I got.
12050,Surprised they don't use tanzanite instead.
12051,"Wait, what am I saying."
12052,"If they don't sell their tanzanite, how will cruise ships survive?"
12053,The level of hysteria on this sub is not supported by the actual facts of the disease.
12054,"Yes, it's a real disease that only seriously affects a relatively small known population of people."
12055,It's true that some of those people (undiagnosed with other diseases) don't know they fall into that category.
12056,"However, mask wearing largely prevents transmission of the disease."
12057,The ten kids who got sick all went to a mask-less party.
12058,I would think that this sub would be more about education than doomsday after 10 months of knowledge about the disease.
12059,"But people just like to be scared, and no post I write is going to change that."
12060,Expect Tanzania to be voted the most favorite country by the Facebook mommy groups.
12061,🤷‍♀️👩🏻🤷‍♀️👨🏻👩🏻👩👨💁‍♀️
12062,"It's a bold strategy cotton, let's see if it pays off"
12063,"Obesity doesn't make you get the disease, it just makes it worse when you do get the disease."
12064,"So sure, maybe skinny nations have slightly  less cases because more people are just getting it and beating it without getting test, but this isn't slightly less, it's amazingly less and testing would show a much more wide scale infection rate too.. so that's definitely not what's going on."
12065,I would not be surprised if eastern asian nations do have some genetic advantages because that's my first guess looking at the massive differences in cases.
12066,"I5ve been hearing from my right wing cousin that the reason the pacific nations did so well against sars-cov2 is NOT due to policies, but due instead to the fact that they had some immunity from sars-1 outbreaks in early 2000s."
12067,Does anyone know if there's any validity to these claims?
12068,"Just based on a cursory look, sars-1 didnt make any kind of meaningful presence into the greater populations, because i think it was too lethal, so therefore it couldnt account for herd immunity against sars-cov2."
12069,We tried to.
12070,People still chose to travel and socialize.
12071,The issue is that healthcare providers are a finite resource.
12072,"It doesn’t matter how many ICU beds or ventilators there are, we need people to staff them."
12073,The only way to prepare was to prevent this.
12074,But people are still out going to shopping malls.
12075,It’s not just the COVID deniers who are an issue.
12076,Everyone has some explanation about how whatever their social plans are aren’t really a risk and it’s everyone else causing the problem.
12077,This was all set in motion starting in October.
12078,Newsom left lockdown enforcement to the counties/cities.
12079,Many of those cities decided not to enforce restrictions.
12080,People were still flooding bars in San Diego this past weekend even though the bars are supposed to be closed.
12081,I’m so disgusted with people right now.
12082,Everyone is bitching about the healthcare system falling short.
12083,But it’s the residents &amp; tourists who dropped the ball.
12084,Well I am Jacks complete lack of surprise.
12085,It was bought before the vaccine was proven to be effective
12086,It’s doesn’t really work like that though.
12087,"Nurses already know how to nurse, you can just jump right in there, especially in a crisis."
12088,"We all know how to spike a bag, start an IV, wipe a butt, empty a foley."
12089,You ask where something is and someone points it out.
12090,More staff would have an immediate positive effect.
12091,"And I say nurses just because that’s usually what is most needed, but really it could be any healthcare position."
12092,General hospital care is quite universal.
12093,By far the biggest difference is the age groups affected.
12094,COVID is killing the elderly and sick whereas Spanish Flu killed the young and healthy.
12095,Don't say every hospital.
12096,My current hospital gave the vaccine out to anyone wants it.
12097,There was no preferential treatment.
12098,I saw executive leaders mixed in with nurses and all staff for the lines in our hospital.
12099,"All staff and volunteers are encouraged, but it's not mandatory."
12100,That's 7500 employees total.
12101,Gov.
12102,Desantis has ordered hospitals to vaccinate as much staff as interested in the first few weeks.
12103,After that it will be dispersed to the community.
12104,One might think that all those Nebraska meat processing plants might see a benefit to employee vaccination programs.
12105,Surely there's a few undocumented workers there.
12106,"But you know it'snot going to the betterment of the hospital, it's going towards the boss's new yacht!"
12107,Thank goodness these rich people can't get sick from their staff while they give Covid to each other because they are dirty peasants who can't afford to donate to the hospital.
12108,"Good read, thank you very much."
12109,You didn’t ‘solve’ anything lol.
12110,[deleted]
12111,It's always been this way.
12112,The Titanic let first class board lifeboats before they allowed second class and third class.
12113,I looked into that and you also need to have an employer lined up or a lump sum to invest or to start a business
12114,Honestly at this point I barely care Just.
12115,Get.
12116,Everyone.
12117,Vaccinated.
12118,"The fines imposed on hospitals for not getting the vaccine to the right people is causing doses to just sit and worst case, go bad."
12119,"Yes the elderly and at-risk should be getting it first, but getting those shots in anyone's arm is ultimately good."
12120,Once they've cheated their way to the front of the line they'll go away and the rest of is can get it.
12121,Don't Treat on Me ^But ^lay ^down ^while ^I ^drive ^over ^you
12122,Or the fact that in countries with socialized healthcare and no economic incentives the COVID death rates are very comparable.
12123,"I often ask in general terms ""how stupid can you be?"""
12124,It's like this man aims to answer that rethorical questiom over and over again.
12125,So what will they do?!
12126,Call immigration while you're in line to get the vaccine?
12127,Whoaw what a noble thing to do.
12128,Yeah.
12129,Ours.

12131,LOL!
12132,You came back almost a month later to make this profound comment.
12133,Bitter much?
12134,"&gt;	The difference isn't the ease of controlling the pandemic, but the will."
12135,It is absolutely easier to ensure compliance in smaller populations.
12136,I don’t know why people are so religious about denying this basic fact.
12137,"It's more about an ill workforce not being as productive and that the cost of preventing deaths is much lower than the replacement cost of ""Human Capital"" IMO

That said, after donating as much as he has I'm willing to let him get a little preachy

Totally agree in 5 years the social sciences (econ,poli sci) are going to be pumping out PhD's that did their thesis on this."
12138,"Somewhat related, but I'm looking to buy a house soon and I honestly don't understand how the market stays afloat."
12139,"Almost every house is $500,000+ even though the median household income is like $80,000."
12140,How the fuck are people making this work?
12141,You know what we should do?
12142,I had this idea that might help.
12143,We can wear a mask to cover our mouth and nose.
12144,There is no practical way to force compliance with contact tracing.
12145,With a couple cases here and there?
12146,Maybe.
12147,But that horse left the barn back in February.
12148,them getting it first is actually slowing the process for sure.

12155,New hampshire reported thier uptake rate has been 75 to 80% in the health care provider group.
12156,"They also seemed to imply it's mostly been the lower educated groups of health care (CNAs, janitorial, food service) that are currently refusing and they believe this will change as they see everyone else getting it."
12157,I don't think it's a huge problem...
12158,Yet.
12159,"Here in the west, americans stockpiled masks which ensured lots of people were left without any."
12160,Price gouging went on for a long time.
12161,"Now that we are able to manufacture masks locally, the situation and prices have improved a little, here in Finland at least."
12162,"My understanding is that initially, citizens were instructed not to use masks so that people wouldn't hoard them because medical professionals need them more acutely..."
12163,"I am British, but have been living in Florida for a few years."
12164,"I moved back home in December and I took a test before leaving, but nobody asked for it."
12165,I was quite surprised.
12166,"Okay, I'll say it – I honestly did not expect the rich to get the vaccine much later than early stage rollout and I can't say I mind."
12167,"I don't know why I think this is acceptable, but I do."
12168,"I think the more people get the vaccine, the better, if it's not the most vital people who get it first, oh, well, at least someone is getting it and the virus spread is slowing down."
12169,"I know it's important to protect the vulnerable populations and all but the world is not perfect and I honestly prioritize the speed over anything else, just vaccinate everyone as quickly as possible."
12170,My understanding is that 40% is why others at the hospitals are getting it.
12171,"If the hospital still has 60% of their batch available, they probably ought to get it out as quickly as possible and the easiest way is to call those already affiliated with the hospital"
12172,Oh and don't forget that hospitals are banking in on this big time.
12173,"Ignore the fact that tons of patients are racking up literal millions in bills and then dying, leaving the hospital or the state to foot the bill, and there's no elective surgeries to help balance out that cost."
12174,My personal favorite.
12175,What does that have to do with anything I said?
12176,These masks are far better than any of those common blue or white k95 masks.
12177,You'd immediately see that if you had them side by side or put them on.
12178,These are made in the USA electrostatic filtering CUPPED semi rigid masks.
12179,"They don't flop around, they seal to your face, they are lab rated."
12180,they are made in the USA.
12181,WHY THE HELL are you people so stubborn about being told about better masks.
12182,"DEAR LORD no wonder the country is doing so bad, it's full of know it alls who can't read!"

12206,"Late reply, but you may be interested to see nsw weekly case reports to get an understanding of transmission."
12207,"They’re not as in-depth, but it does show that superspreading (at  large social events) is far outweighing secondary transmission within the home/office ... at least in the context of early identification of a cluster."
12208,Here’s one https://www.health.nsw.gov.au/Infectious/covid-19/Documents/covid-19-surveillance-report-20201226.pdf    See page 14.
12209,"16 primary exposure sites (one of which was a private dinner party, the rest were public)."
12210,Ranges between 28-1 infected at each event for a total of 99 primary cases.
12211,Those lead to 4 secondary infections outside the home and 21 within the home.
12212,The cluster is a bit weird since the 2 sites with the most confirmed cases were a bowling club (lawn bowls) and rsl (retired serviceman’s league).
12213,So would’ve skewed older/retired.
12214,That means fewer chances for workplace spread and maybe explains why the high case load in the first place - older might be a bit more likely to catch it (as well as more likely to suffer severe effects.)
12215,"I mean, we did have SARS (Caused by a Coronavirus) back in 2003 and we were very lucky to contain it."
12216,You didn't have to be Nostradamus to realize that our most likely threat in terms of a disease was either Influenza or Coronavirus.

12221,"Remove stability and introduce fear, then watch as human beings respond irrationally"
12222,There is no reason for any medical system to be prepared for what we are experiencing now.
12223,COVID patients need medical staff trained in respiratory care.
12224,There isn’t generally a need for so many people trained with those skills.
12225,"Plus COVID patients remain in the ICU longer than most patients needing the same care do, which further reduces resources."
12226,There shouldn’t have been any scenario where we reach this point.
12227,"It wasn’t planned for because when experts ran through the scenarios, “government actively working to sabotage efforts to contain the disease”, “people acting selfish as fuck while endangering their own lives”, and “law enforcement doing Jack shit to enforce restrictions” were not accounted for."
12228,You said long term safety testing would be required for each escape mutation.
12229,"What I’m trying to say is that with a proven platform formulation, as we already have for the flu, this would not be required."
12230,All that needs to happen is that the new sequence for the mutant strain gets inserted into the existing vaccine which can  be done in a matter of weeks.
12231,Thats a ridiculous oversimplification of the bill.

12248,"No Democracy can just ""shake off"" a Anti-Democrat as leader."

12260,"That's not true, the 1918 flu was just as easily transmitted and far more deadly."
12261,It also hit harder on young people which of course hits the economies much harder than Covid (which kills mainly people who are already retired or about to retire).
12262,"If you read what you linked, oops777 wasn't the one that named him."
12263,That Gates quote kinds of sounds like a moral argument.
12264,I’m not sure it’s clear that “can’t” means it doesn’t make sense or is impossible.
12265,Republicans take it as “it’s unacceptable” and dismiss it as self righteous moralizing.
12266,The point is that the economy relies on people spending money.
12267,So they need to have money and also be willing to spend it.
12268,They need confidence that things will not get worse and also be willing to leave the house and spend.
12269,Simply opening businesses does not accomplish those things.
12270,It will be interesting to see what economists come out with in the coming years.
12271,Comparing New Zealand to the rest of the world.

12308,Ivy League doesn't really mean anything in NZ because all the universities are public.
12309,I'm a NZ citizen so obviously I've never immigrated into NZ but I believe it is more based on whether you can bring professional skills to service a skills shortage (unless you are extremely wealthy and then you can apparently buy your way in).
12310,"While your achievements are nice, NZ performs well in tertiary education compared with other OECD standards and the education system is quite robust with NZers being able to fill most of its own roles within the education system."

12350,"I mean just overall, tracking those who have received both doses and seeing how many still end up contracting Covid."
12351,"I realize that, yes."
12352,But I also realize that case numbers will stay high despite vaccinating at risk populations and that the number of cases is what drives the restrictions.
12353,My (uneducated) guess is that deaths and hospitalizations will decrease in a few months but case numbers will stay relatively high until we have mass vaccination a year from now.
12354,That’s why I think we’ll still be doing social distancing in 2022.
12355,Was there any doubt?
12356,I mean you have to  be really stupid to think China will allow this in the first place.
12357,They will hide the origins of the virus.
12358,There’s a reason China’s contained the virus.
12359,"It’s great to have universal freedom in normal times, but continuing to have those freedoms during a pandemic is why we have 3.5k deaths a day right now."

12361,Can you get tested for COVID antibodies?
12362,It would tell you if you had a past infection
12363,Probably they want them to be able to work at the hospital?

12414,"My state NSW has decentralised health as well, which is why we handled the virus more effectively than Victoria."
12415,But contract tracing was handled on a state level.
12416,"Victoria had a very antiquated contract tracing system at the start of the pandemic (basically 1 part time employee hahah), the delays in collecting the data on Sweden sounds a lot like what they experienced."
12417,Thankfully they invested some money and its a lot better now.
12418,We've never had an issue in NSW with getting all the data together (NSW has been developing and improving its contact tracing system for years).

12430,The problem is the phased rollout.
12431,They won't give vaccinations to people who aren't eligible in the current phase even if there is nobody in the current phase coming in for vaccinations.
12432,That's an absolute failure in planning and management.
12433,"As soon as demand drops in the current phase, they should open up the next phase."
12434,&gt;It’s specifically 64.1% for the Oxford/AZ vaccine and closer to 52% for the Pfizer vaccine.
12435,The 2nd dose efficacy of both vaccines is not significantly diminished by spreading out the 2nd dose.
12436,"I don't think you're trying to make a comparison here, but just want to point out that these numbers aren't comparable."
12437,"The Astrazeneca number includes only cases 21 days after the first dose was administered, whereas the Pfizer number includes all cases from the time of administration of the first dose, even if it was the day after the dose was administered (see page 32 [here](https://www.fda.gov/media/144245/download))."
12438,"Astrazeneca was able to get this data for a longer period because, [due to lack of supplies, they weren't able to vaccinate everyone on schedule](https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(20)32661-1/fulltext)."

12459,Vaccinechella
12460,Doesn’t stop these dumbfucks from downvoting the truth apparently.
12461,This sub is mental
12462,The WHO have been seen arriving  back at their home airport carrying new briefcases and looking very happy
12463,"Damn, that's great to hear."
12464,15% vaccinated with both doses in January is amazing.
12465,"&gt; Contact tracing relies heavily on honesty and memory, both of which are inherently flawed..."
12466,Which backward country do you live in?
12467,"Contact tracing is done using Big Data and AI, not honesty and memory."
12468,https://asia.nikkei.com/Business/Technology/Asian-cities-harness-big-data-and-AI-for-contact-tracing
12469,Sad sad sad.
12470,250 people who should be dead last to get vaccinated...
12471,So.... at that rate we will be done 2022?
12472,"... 

Do you think the virus magically inhabited him like immaculate conception?"
12473,Lol
12474,"Was taking classes at a children's hospital.. its universally called ""the crud"" the unspecified illness that being around large groups of dirty kids that adults catch."
12475,"A major local hospital announced that they will have vaccinated all of their staff, including administrators, by early January."
12476,Why should 30-something administrators who have been working from home get the shot before vulnerable elders who aren't in care homes?
12477,I think so since i follow this shit since january of 2020
12478,Then what was the mod message that was up top for a bit?
12479,"&gt;	Masks are cheap and not very effective, maybe 2%."
12480,FTFY
12481,50% of those 60+?!
12482,That's cool.
12483,I hope we see a greatly reduced mortality rate from the current wave.
12484,Hold my supermarket bought beer
12485,"You realize that not every single person needs to be vaccinated to essentially end the pandemic, right?"
12486,What do you think will happen to restrictions once vaccination has effectively ended mass hospitalizations and overloaded hospitals?
12487,"That's what going to happen first, once the at-risk population and frontline workers are vaccinated."
12488,"There are 18,000 CVS and Walgreens in the United States."
12489,If each one did just 28 vaccinations per day that would be an extra half a million doses per day.
12490,"I recognize the challenges of storage and a pharmacy isn’t going to have a freezer that goes to -70 degrees, but surely at least every medium sized city has one or one that can be setup that can be used as central storage then provide daily deliveries to the pharmacies."
12491,CVS and Walgreens already have online appointment systems setup for testing that can easily be repurposed for the vaccine.
12492,I'm in Michigan and am the administrator of a small rural clinic.
12493,About 25 percent of my staff passed on the opportunity to get vaccinated yesterday at the county health department.
12494,I tried to find out why to no avail.
12495,Fortunately for me they allowed me to be vaccinated as I work in close proximity to patients and that I take personal responsibility to dispose of contaminated PPE from the staff after a suspected COVID patient has been seen.
12496,Late yesterday I received a notice from the local hospital that they are looking to find people to vaccinate.
12497,I really don't understand people sometimes.
12498,&gt; It is an opinion article and was labelled as such.
12499,"It was an opinion article written by a sitting US Senator, who also happens to be on the United States House Committee on Foreign Affairs."
12500,Not exactly something written by Joe Nobody.
12501,"If a Chinese government official had written something, would you have a problem saying that China wrote it?"
12502,Nope.

12504,It's not taken seriously by design in order to 'protect the economy'.

12525,"As long as the cull is done properly, it should limit spread"
12526,Redditers do too
12527,The really poor people I know are on Medicaid.
12528,"It's not ideal for them, and it's sometimes hard to find providers, but they definitely go to the ER."
12529,"You can also read books about the medical system, such as *The Harm We Do*, where there is a large section that covers the under-insured, and how they use the ER for everything because they don't have access to other healthcare."
12530,Afraid of getting killed in combat?
12531,"Dont worry, theres a higher chance you'll survive and succumb to a deadly viral pandemic several years later."
12532,Yep.
12533,"And by proxy, Canada is screwed too."
12534,Like a hazmat suit with independent respirator?

12537,"Masks are cheap and effective, not 100%."
12538,Teachers come i to contact with more people than nursing home residents.
12539,Vaccines haven’t kicked in yet so that metric would be totally meaningless
12540,Its awful that he died but why is it always someone's fault?
12541,"He died because of the virus, period."
12542,Not because of someone that came too close etc.
12543,Never mind information is always changing about a virus we didn't know existed until literally a year ago.
12544,"But no, Fauci has to be spot on with every single thing from the get go apparently."

12547,"Yeah, but again, the cult of Trump or something else would work too."
12548,"I read this somewhere else, but we should probably start using a 7 day average for vaccinations, too."
12549,Some states are only reporting weekly so we really don't know what number we're at right now in the first place.
12550,Different strokes.
12551,I've been on a few.
12552,"For me, it's not the ship, it's the destinations."
12553,A cruise ship is basically a floating hotel.
12554,"Every night you go to sleep, and then you wake up and get to explore the next city."
12555,"I'm not talking booze cruises, but something like a cruise of the Mediterranean."
12556,"My favorite one visited to Venice, Rome, Naples, Florence, Athens, Mykonos, Istanbul, Kusadasi, Marseille, and Barcelona."
12557,They basically planned to shut down before china admited human to human transmission.
12558,It was clear from the early medical bulletins which I read as they came in around late dec early Jan it was human to human.
12559,Vietnam read them and made the right call.
12560,Agreed this is absolutely heartbreaking.
12561,I work in healthcare and a lot of my coworkers are not taking it because they feel that there isn’t enough data/research.
12562,A socially distanced waiting room of unemployed people willing to sit for a few hours and not get vaccinated if all goes well.
12563,"How is that almost a year into this pandemic so many countries and regions are facing wave after wave, some with their highest rates of infection and death currently happening?"
12564,Why are so many countries slow at getting people vaccinated?
12565,"As this article shows, it's not just Canada, not just UK, not just Japan."
12566,I didn't get fed shit.
12567,Had to buy lunch.
12568,Yes.
12569,That’s true.
12570,But these magical rapid tests that they won’t approve would be much much cheaper!
12571,They would cost a little over $1 per test.
12572,"And I am thinking more along the lines of testing 
co-workers in a restaurant that is not open for dining...the cooks, the servers etc."
12573,Or testing the employees working all day inside a closed warehouse.
12574,But the dentist office (which I find terrifying) could test every patient...a great way to reduce the airborne transmission that would hang in the air between each patient if they could turn away infected patients.
12575,We really have to be proactive about this.
12576,Everyone is just testing when they start to feel symptoms and by that point they have already infected other people.
12577,"As you mentioned, if everyone acted as if everyone was infected then we wouldn’t need the frequent testing but people are careless and irresponsible."
12578,"You are right, they probably won’t test themselves."
12579,"But if certain places required it , I think it would make a difference."
12580,It still won’t prevent people from hanging out in small cramped parties over the weekend but if they had to get tested at their workplace on a Monday they could be removed if they test positive and before infecting anyone else.
12581,The pace of vaccination is barely improving if at all.
12582,People are expecting it to improve but we are still showing very little sign of improvement.
12583,"named, shamed, drawn, and quartered."
12584,It depends.

12587,Pandemic protection is structurally incompatible with American culture.

12636,"Correct, and nasal cannula is up to 8lpm, but they all need an oxygen source."
12637,"In the hospital that is usually from the wall (I honestly have no idea what the system that is connected to looks like, I know there is a guy at our hospital who delivered tanks regularly but as far as I know it could be little elves that exhale pure O2.)"
12638,or they are on mobile O2 tanks that we wheel around when they are up and walking (that’s my job as a physical therapist).
12639,But we are taking about two different things.
12640,"The concentrators pull O2 from the air, but as far as I know they only go up to a few ppm at most."
12641,Or tanks are the SOURCE of oxygen.

12686,I don't think you're following my argument here.
12687,He just did explain why the US has the issue it has...
12688,"&gt;(Reuters) - Miguel Cabezola, a driver for United Parcel Service Inc in Tucson, Arizona, complained on March 27 to U.S. workplace safety regulators, alleging the company was taking a lax approach to social distancing, sanitizing equipment and quarantining workers with COVID-19 symptoms."
12689,"The guidance gutted the notification requirement for two reasons: Coronavirus symptoms - much less hospitalizations - do not occur within 24 hours of virus exposure, according to public health experts, and the exact moment of infection is impossible to determine."
12690,"Tyson did not answer questions from Reuters about its workers’ OSHA complaints, but said it has invested $540 million since April in safety improvements across all its U.S. plants, including temperature checks, health screenings, random testing and plexiglass dividers for workstations."
12691,I wouldn't call it an obsession with justice.
12692,"Just entitlement, and ""fuck you, I got mine"" mentality."
12693,We don't even have a vaccine deal yet 🤦‍♀
12694,"When something spreads exponentially, if you do half-assed health measures, you get quarter-assed results."
12695,That link is staying blue.
12696,My idiotic government will re-open kindergardens and primary schools but with strict opening and closing times and many breaks.
12697,So why fucking open them when you won't really teach that good?
12698,"I'm uni and all the exams will be online, quiz or oral with cam examinations, and if uni lessons and exams which are waaaaay more difficult can be done through the internet, then i'm sure these can be done online as well."
12699,Last october when the uni lessons were done back in rooms etc one in particular was very practical and i was needed to wear the stupid white apron thing coat while i wasn't touching any chemicals as the professor wasn't allowed and anyone to do experiments etc.
12700,So i was going there and was exposed to potentially covid-19.
12701,I wasn't and still to this moment am fine.
12702,"But i ask myself, why shouldn't they try and influence more and more parts of the population to stay inside, especially pupils who don't really do important and stuff that you need to do in the teaching buildings."
12703,Leave the part of the popoulation that can't work or study from home to work outside because they fucking can't.

12713,I suspect something is up in MI.
12714,We have 60 PEDS patients with COVID.
12715,That's the highest number I've ever seen for kids.
12716,Adult numbers and therefore overall numbers are still down for us (Pos.
12717,"rate is spiking again), but up until now, if we had double digits of peds patients, that was a bad week."
12718,60 is almost unheard of.
12719,"And while the majority of them are suspected, not yet confirmed, this is still nearly the highest number, and with our current hospital situation, I know they are not admitting anyone, even kids, just out of an abundance of caution (I have literally been told that within the last 72 hours)."
12720,"We know it was spreading in the schools back in March, and we know that at that point, they were giving out admissions left and right for abundance of caution, because we didn't know what this did to kids yet, so I don't think this is just from holiday travel and kids going back to school, and despite that, our numbers for kids weren't that bad then."
12721,Something has changed here and not for the better.
12722,"Either a known mutation, or a brand new one, or some other factor that just hasn't been addressed yet."
12723,"Sadly, here in US we crossed that point like back in May, 2020."

12730,Who are the trade partners of New Zealand?
12731,IDK.
12732,The only part of that I have a feeling for is... A small business would go out of business if they had to pay for testing every customer.

12741,They said the longest it took was back in October after President Trump tested positive and everyone was rushing to get tested.
12742,The line of cars was over two hours and it took four days to get the results.
12743,He wants the benefits of being POTUS.
12744,"Also, he doesn't want to go to jail."
12745,Can they also produce some phase 3 trial data?

12748,When did he say that?

12765,Yeah I am so ashamed of our government here in the US.
12766,... log2(100) = 6.644
12767,My money's on stupid.

12777,What about Los Angeles I think they need one too
12778,So here's the thing.
12779,Why are we vaccinating elderly people in nursing homes in the first round?
12780,"Yes give the shots to first line health care workers, including those that work in nursing homes and care facilities."
12781,But don't waste the shots on people who do not go out in public and spread the virus if they get it.
12782,They should be just as safe when the care workers are vaccinated and they stay in the facility.
12783,"Health care workers first and foremost yes, but then vaccinate essential workers like grocery/food service, infrastructure and construction workers, mail and delivery personnel, truck drivers, etc.."
12784,The people who are actually out in public spreading the virus!
12785,And not to be a ghoul but if the protection is only short term is it smart to waste vaccine doses on someone who might die within a few months anyway from normal age related problems?
12786,"By protecting the younger, active, out in the community people quicker the virus won't be able to spread."
12787,The only elderly people who are spreading it are the old Republican politicians at these super spreader parties and events.....

12819,The US does this too.
12820,There's some controversial practice where they modify the virus to see it's affect.
12821,"They may have been doing that, but this was most likely a virus captured in the wild and then escaped from the lab."
12822,The main supporting evidence that biologists have put forward is  that the virus closely resembles animals that aren't normally found in that part of China but could have come from samples in a corona virus lab.

12842,"For many  teachers their option is  to do what the district wants or quit, and in some states they can penalize the teacher by fining them or even stripping them of their license."
12843,you can't just grow a bunch of new doctors and nurses.
12844,Protecting kids is not and never was the issue with schools.
12845,Covid has very little chance of actually causing medical issue for kids (thank god).
12846,"The issue with schools is that the kids act as vectors for transmission between different households, and one of the most connected ones."
12847,Far more connections than all but the biggest workplaces.

12942,The title really made me wonder why the poor puppy doctors are getting the VID so brutally
12943,Pay in doses.
12944,100 or 1000 doses per person should do the trick.
12945,See thats the problem is how these headlines make it seem is that patients are being left to die which is not the case if this patient is in cardiac arrest ie no heart beat not breathing then they will be worked on scene until a pulse can be established if this does not happen within 20-30 minutes then the patient is secured on scene and the resuscitation efforts are ceased.
12946,This just helps improve patient care anyways as it was found working patients on scene improved chances of getting pulses back (rosc) also we are getting away from just giving everyone oxygen anyways.
12947,Long story shirt if you are having a heart attack you will be transported but if you are in cardiac arrest you wont be until you have pulses again.

12962,That would mean the number of first doses administered is cut in half when the second doses start being administered.
12963,Youre crazy if you belief the number of first shots will decrease that dramatically at one point.
12964,"Also consider that there were 140 million people in the USA in 1945 compared to just short of 330 million people today, and the USA largely avoided the chief casualty sources that effected most other combatant nations (Civilian Bombing of US Holdings was pretty limited)

12995,This will be within the 1st 100 days depending on the area.

13061,"there is a general trend for viruses to become less lethal over time, but dipshits have been running with the argument that mutations always make viruses less lethal since this pandemic began."
13062,the actual reality is more complex and we cant know that 99 percent of mutations would be less virulent.
13063,"this paper uses the term virulence to refer to mortality

&gt;To be as general as possible, we assume a simple working definition of virulence: the harm caused by pathogen infection, particularly in terms of host morbidity and mortality."
13064,"and

&gt;A commonly stated idea is that there is often an evolutionary trade-off between virulence and transmissibility because intra-host virus replication is necessary to facilitate inter-host transmission but may also lead to disease, and it is impossible for natural selection to optimize all traits simultaneously."
13065,"In the case of MYXV, this trade-off is thought to lead to ‘intermediate’ virulence grades being selectively advantageous: higher virulence may mean that the rabbit host dies before inter-host transmission, whereas lower virulence is selected against because it does not increase virus transmission rates."
13066,A similar trade-off model has been proposed to explain the evolution of HIV virulence40.
13067,"However, many doubts have been raised about the general applicability of the trade-off model35,41,42,43, virus fitness will be affected by traits other than virulence and transmissibility39,41,44, contrary results have been observed in experimental studies45 and relatively little is known about evolutionary trade-offs in nature."
13068,"For example, in the case of the second virus released as a biocontrol against European rabbits in Australia — rabbit haemorrhagic disease virus (RHDV) — there is evidence that virulence has increased through time, probably because virus transmission often occurs through blow flies that feed on animal carcasses, making host death selectively favourable46."
13069,"Similarly, experimental studies of plant RNA viruses have shown that high virulence does not necessarily impede host adaptation47 and, in the case of malaria, higher virulence was shown to provide the Plasmodium parasites with a competitive advantage within hosts48."

13081,That's really interesting and I didn't know it was possible to destroy a virus by 'over-mutating' it like that.
13082,"However this won't happen with the virus naturally, its mutation rate is now enough to slowly evolve without being destroyed."
13083,It's an interesting research path for antivirals though!
13084,Why is the vaccinations so slow right now?
13085,"I’ve been looking for infuriation, but I can’t find anything."
13086,"Of course, the reality is that it could get far, far worse."
13087,"With that in mind, I like to think it's best to keep ahead and take necessary measures based on an overestimate rather than the opposite."
13088,"At 1 million vaccine shots a day, it will take well over year to vaccinate everyone."
13089,"Remember, two shots are required so if you want to vaccinate 250 million people, at 2 million shots a day would take 500 days."

13138,A little knowledge is a dangerous thing.
13139,"There is a long term tendency for viruses to become less lethal and they often do face tradeoffs between transmission and lethality, but that doesn't mean that we can predict how likely that is for each mutation."

13157,"I've read a lot about the Titanic over the years and there's so much more to that disaster than the regular person knows:

1) The lookouts did not have binoculars because the officer who had the key to the locker was replaced at the last minute."
13158,Oops.
13159,2) The crew conducted no lifeboat drills during training or the voyage.
13160,"The biggest lifeboat drill conducted was when the ship was in port, some of the crew lowered a boat, it rowed around the dock for a few minutes then they brought it back up."
13161,3) Nobody in the crew knew how many people the boats were able to carry.
13162,Most of Titanic's lifeboats could hold 65 people comfortably and were tested with 70.
13163,"The emergency boats held 40, the collapsible boats held 47."
13164,The regular boats had their bottom reinforced with steel so they wouldn't split as they were being lowered with full capacity.
13165,The crew also did not know this.
13166,4) Everyone knows the Titanic didn't have enough lifeboats for everyone on board.
13167,"The reason why is because the conventional wisdom at the time was if a ship was going to sink, it would sink so slowly that distress signals could be fired off and another ship(s) would be able to get there in time."
13168,And then the lifeboats would just be used to ferry passengers from A to B.
13169,This actually happened a few years before on another White Star ship.
13170,"Lifeboats were also mandated by weight, not passenger capacity, and the regulations were really outdated."
13171,"5) Some historians say, based on the actual timeline and how the boats were launched, that even if the ship had enough lifeboats for everyone, they would not have been launched in time before the ship sank anyway."

13180,Exactly - reduce the amount of folks that can be spreading it.
13181,Viruses don't want anything.
13182,They are here because they reproduce.
13183,They mutate because the reproduction isn't perfect.
13184,"It's chaotic, so the mutations aren't a means to achieve an end, but random-like that can change the structure of the proteins generated in a way that affects how the virus interacts with its environment."
13185,"A virus' perpetuation (they don't really ""survive"", just replicate) is dependent on its ability to either remain in a host or find a new one."
13186,"While it may be a good strategy to be more benign and contagious, viruses don't strategize."
13187,Being less deadly will only be selected for if it results in a better ability to find new hosts.
13188,Plus it's not clear if a virus adapts to be less deadly when it's been in a population for a long time or if the population is the one that adapts because those whose biology is less likely to survive the virus die off.
13189,"Personally, I think the way the European viruses absolutely wrecked the native American populations is a sign the latter case plays a bigger role, but it's likely a combination of the two."

13326,The virus as far as we know isn't at a stage where it can pick and choose.
13327,"We know that due to incubation period, you can have the virus for 5-14 days *afair* before becoming symptomatic, which for kids symptoms won't be as bad."
13328,We know that you can still shed the virus while being asymptomatic in those days before you start to have symptoms.
13329,"What we don't know is, why."
13330,Why are some people asymptomatic and shedding covid while others aren't?
13331,Why are some kids symptomatic and others aren't?
13332,"For this, this is why teachers are more at risk."
13333,One sick student can lead to an entire school of Covid cases.
13334,Even schools with proper PPE and social distancing rules are still susceptible due to parents who knowingly send their kids to school sick and parents with political views.
13335,These schools aren't kindergarten.
13336,We're talking schools where students are in at least 5 different classrooms interacting with at least 6 teachers a day.
13337,A sick teacher wouldn't have to come in contact with another teacher to infect them.
13338,They don't have to teach any of the same students.

13767,We still don’t know if the vaccine works against the new South African strain.
13768,If the antibody therapies don’t work then there is a good chance the new strain can get people sick again and the current vaccines don’t work.
13769,"The vaccines target the spike proteins, and the new variant has many mutations in the spike protein."
13770,"If I had to guess, they have a much higher rate of production (60 million+ monthly) and doesn't need to be stored in ultra low temperatures, but it's only got limited approval so far and is at least 2 weeks away from full approval."
13771,Covishield (SII/Oxford/AstraZeneca) has 100+ million doses being made a month and has full approval.
13772,Both these vaccines have 75% efficacy.
13773,"But it won't matter, those vaccines will go to India first as they are made there, and also why the very large production numbers."
13774,No evidence that it's becoming dominant in any of them.
13775,"Yes the great city of California is very dirty, and you totally passed 7th grade geography too."
13776,Well it needs to!

13781,I live in Vancouver and am outside all year round.
13782,It’s mild which means a little rain requires a jacket or shell but that’s it.
13783,It does rain a lot but it’s generally light unlike the east coast.
13784,Also in the winter a lot of people hit the peaks for snow based activities.

13793,"Not suggesting we can fully relax, just that we don't have 1/10000 the problem of the USA or Europe."
13794,Considering it's a 2 dose regimen this is still close to a year and a half to vaccinate 70% of Americans.

13809,*
13810,&gt;This is for a variety of reasons but one being so that jurors can judge credibility of witnesses in person in a way that doesn’t translate over zoom.
13811,The number of wrongly convicted people seems to say maybe the credibility of witnesses doesn't translate that well in person.
13812,There's nothing more Texan than free executions for as many people who showed up to the trial as possible.
13813,Unless we count the excess deaths (which we all know are covid but we aren’t using for models) it’s still absurd.
13814,"We would need to double that weekly death number this week and the next two, in order to hit that by the end of January."
13815,This wave is going to get terrifyingly high.
13816,Maybe even worse than that by the end.
13817,but there are no stair step functions in viral spread.
13818,"It’s not that the virus isn’t terrifyingly bad, it’s just that the end of January is too close for the numbers to change that fast"
13819,"I think that it depends on the court/area and I wonder if, given the situation with the pandemic, they may let more slide than usual."
13820,"The court has discretion, and it really isn't a good look for them to bully people into serving during a pandemic."
13821,Don't forget the needles all over the place.
13822,You are right.
13823,It seems they changed the article title and updated the link.
13824,The updated article can be found [here](https://www.thenationalnews.com/uae/health/coronavirus-more-than-800-000-vaccine-jabs-given-in-uae-1.1141026).
13825,Perhaps I should delete this and create a new that reflects the new link.
13826,because people needed an excuse for their incompetence
13827,"they need to get with the times and adapt to using zoom, At the least have jurors in different rooms than the defendants, judges,,,etc and just zoom the calls in the courthouse."
13828,"The only reason why they want jurors in the same room as the defendants,because the lawyers, is that the lawyers can easily Manipulate the jurors in person."
13829,Bruh lol
13830,"I'm sure I'm not the only one on here who knows this, but wanted to spread a little actual information."
13831,If you just read the headline and don't know what EMS is or does you'll freak out.
13832,"But in fact in cardiac arrest paramedics provide all the appropriate rescusitation measures on scene, providing ACLS (advanced cardiac life support) care."
13833,"The same measures that you would receive as a patient in cardiac arrest in the hospital or emergency department with excellent CPR, advanced airway placement and monitoring, cardiac monitoring and defibrillation as indicated, intravenous or interosseous access and administration of the appropriate medications."
13834,It has been the standard of care since before I came into EMS almost 10 years ago that you do not transport a patient in cardiac arrest if you do not obtain ROSC (return of spontaneous circulation) within 30 minutes of starting advanced cardiac life support.
13835,They are declared dead and care turned over to the appropriate authorities for medical examiner evaluation and transport to the morgue or funeral home.
13836,The thing which is described here as something horrific and new is no change from what the standard of care has been for many many years.
13837,&gt;Do you think these folks are interested in the vaccine?
13838,Would you get vaccinated against a virus you ***don't*** believe ***exists*** ~~to be harmless~~?
13839,Little help for ya there...
13840,I got the Moderna vaccine Sunday afternoon.
13841,"Had extreme, and I mean extreme, fatigue until early Monday afternoon."
13842,Totally fine after that.
13843,I think arm was just as sore for any vaccine.
13844,Seeing the same case in UK looks like Pfizer is not being able to produce enough vaccine to cover second doses.
13845,They should have partnered with other manufacturer like the oxford-astrazeneca have done in different regions
13846,Lucky you.
13847,What an asinine game of musical chairs.
13848,"But, as long as the musics playin', ammirite?"

13853,This is what my hospital did.

Antechamber."
13855,This is where you are registered.
13856,"We had to make appointments ahead of time, show up around your time slot."

13858,Explanation room.
13859,Each chair has a manila folder on it.
13860,A nurse explains the contents.
13861,A FAQ question about the Moderna vaccine.

13863,Voluntary to sign up.)
13864,Your vaccination card.
13865,A consent form which has to be signed.
13866,When filled out you head to the...
13867,Treatment room.
13868,Nurse asks you which arm you want jabbed.
13869,I hardly felt it.
13870,Much different than the flu shot.
13871,Once you have your bandaid you head to the...
13872,Lounge.
13873,Sign in.
13874,Look at the sign on the wall detailing the serious symptoms they are watching you for.
13875,"Difficulty breathing, rash, swelling, dizziness, tachycardia."
13876,"Scroll through your phone for 15 minutes, chat with the other employees waiting there."
13877,"Sign out when the 15 minutes are up, grab a snack on your way out."
13878,That was yesterday.
13879,Today I got the email to sign up for the second shot.
13880,We absolutely make people wait 15-30 minutes at my clinic.
13881,“Perfect being the enemy of good” applies here I think.
13882,"gotcha

makes sense"
13883,Can you postpone to a specific date?
13884,"My husband (who is high risk) was called and was allowed to postpone, but only for two months."
13885,There was no choice about when they'd roll him back into the pool.
13886,So what is the risk of a kid catching the virus at school...then passing it to his/her parents and then spreading to older relatives?
13887,0.1%?
13888,You don't even need higher lethality - only higher transmissibility - for sh\*t to get really out of control.
13889,It is the difference between linear and exponential risk.
13890,Alibaba style.

13896,I'd imagine other methods of oxygen delivery can need more.
13897,"Hot take: if companies weren’t allowed to profit off of covid treatments, we wouldn’t have an American vaccine until at least late this summer if at all"
13898,"“I thought I had mono once for a whole year,  it it turned out I was just really bored.”"
13899,This is extremely negligent on the part of our government.
13900,How can any authority that endangers folks so recklessly and without informed consent be considered legitimate?
13901,Certainly damages any trust a person might have in that sort of system to protect them.
13902,No.
13903,Like I wrote on my comment only dry cough shortness of breath and fatigue.
13904,Probably some brain fog sometimes too.
13905,"They need to reserve the second dose, so that's up to 650k vaccines, with some wasted."
13906,That's no flu!
13907,"To be fair, the issue here is that they're comparing a masked person in a place of high exposure to an unmasked person."
13908,It's not really looking at a scenario where everyone BUT the subject is wearing a mask.
13909,"Put another way, how much will a mask protect you from a spray of droplets containing Covid?"
13910,"Is it still 70%, or was the 70% in part because you weren't being exposed to a direct spray of it because others were wearing masks?"
13911,"Either way though, wear a damn mask, obviously."
13912,If everyone wore one we wouldn't be in this situation.
13913,Why would you throw out days 1-10?
13914,"Also, remember that the 52% is only about not getting the disease."
13915,We have no idea if you can infect others after being innoculated.
13916,"Lots of things to consider, and I'm sure that the UK govt didn't."
13917,I'm glad you came around.
13918,"Contact tracing with rotating classes, coupled with asymptomatic kids shedding would take a minimum of a month."
13919,"Now abruptly school shuts down for a month without proper online class infrastructure and planning, tack on an extra month."
13920,I'm glad I chose to be an engineer versus a teacher.
13921,"The highest paid Teachers here are the equivalent to Super Market department managers, while teachers with less tenure are paid more like the $15/hr garbage man."
13922,Not gonna risk Nanas life because of parents who fought politically.
13923,We all made sacrifices.
13924,"If you're upset that the school having closed inconvenienced you, grow up."
13925,We're past giving unnecessary sympathy.
13926,"I align myself with mothers, but we all made sacrifices with the pandemic."
13927,"You have a child, everything in this world is harder when you bring another life into it, but you made the commitment and if you haven't realized that your child is an inconvenience."
13928,All your friends must have children too.
13929,That's the hard truth.
13930,Your child's teacher wasn't part of your baby making decisions.
13931,"I'm so glad that my family believes in a form of childhood raising so that when issues did arise me being at the age of 7 could be left alone for hours, while it didn't happen i could've gone days."
13932,"Just as long as a kid knows how to use the microwave and isn't developmentally challenged, it's a parents job to prepare them to be self reliant."
13933,"While I wouldn't recommend mostly any 7 year old I know to be left home alone, my single mother didn't go out and protest about shit."
13934,She had to put food on the table.
13935,She didn't fight the loopholes in child support.
13936,She supported her child while still having the time to teach her child how to be self reliant.
13937,Parents just don't understand.
13938,(I have a 7yo daughter in homeschooling.
13939,"It's not the best we can only give her 4 hours a day, but the importance is that we notice her ability to learn and perceive the information."

13942,"I heard they're looking at a rule of thumb of 1m this week, then increasing by approx 1/4 million a week."

13948,"My mistake, it says -

&gt; ...does appear to partially escape prior immunity."
13949,"It means that some of the antibodies people produce when they get infected with Covid, as well as the antibody drugs, may not be quite as effective."
13950,It didn't specifically state polyclonal antibodies.
13951,You did.
13952,I worry with the history of medically abusing BIPOC that many Indigenous people will be hesitant to get it.
13953,Especially if prioritized like this.
13954,I understand why they are being prioritized by the government but I also understand the fear and mistrust of Indigenous people with centuries of generational trauma.

13981,What are they going to do?

13998,Too cool 😎
13999,Hey guys.
14000,This is a rather important request to me.
14001,I wanted to gather data on the number of vaccines distributed and administered to each states of the U.S. since December 13.
14002,The only website I can find that data is the CDC.
14003,The problem is that the CDC doesn't show the past data for how many vaccines were distributed / administered.
14004,"So, does anyone have the data I am looking for that ranges from December 13 to now?"
14005,Thank you.
14006,It's been confirmed that reinfections do happen.
14007,It's just that it is rare.
14008,"Last stat I saw was it was one in 10,000"
14009,God damn it *slams hat on the ground*
14010,Freedom comes at cost.
14011,Masks are a small help.
14012,"Masks should be combined with maintaining at least 6 feet of distance between you and others not in your household, and severely limited your time out of home and inside spaces with restricted airflow."
14013,These measures in combination work surprisingly well.
14014,Yeah.
14015,He’s frustrated.
14016,Gets bad info from time to time (as everyone does).
14017,But he definitely gives a shit which means a lot.

14020,"Their cases have been declining since mid December, actually."
14021,"You can see it in the graph https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/usa/california/

Problem is, once healthcare capacity is reached, even if you get fewer cases every day, they still continue to add to hospitalizations and the system becomes more and more overloaded."
14022,It takes weeks for people to get discharged or die.
14023,"California doesn't have a great bed-to-population ratio, at 1.8 beds per 1000 residents, below the US national average of 2.6."
14024,They are more vulnerable to surging than other states.
14025,"If they can keep their current restrictions and keep the case numbers low, their healthcare system should recover in a few more weeks."

14031,16 mins into this press conference from Monday: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8f02D2SsF_8
14032,"Yes, exactly!"
14033,I don’t think any educators have WANTED to be shut down.
14034,We’ve had to be because we have no resources and we prioritize the safety of our students and ourselves.
14035,"When we opened my site, I had two masks provided by the district, a spay bottle of cleaner, and a gallon of hand sanitizer that would have made my students smell like they’d just been sprayed down with tequila."
14036,Nothing else was provided.
14037,I requested a face shield.
14038,One face shield.
14039,And was told they didn’t have the funding for it.
14040,I ended up buying my own.
14041,Kids can’t share supplies.
14042,Was I provided any?
14043,Nope.
14044,And most kids can’t afford their own.
14045,I always provide shared supplies.
14046,"As for books, we can’t use them."
14047,The copy machine is also out since we weren’t allowed to share it in case we contaminated each other.
14048,No chrome books were available because they were still checked out to students in case we had to return to remote.
14049,"If we get the funding we need to open safely, I’m all for it!"
14050,But most schools haven’t been provided that.
14051,"All we were directed to do was open, so hopefully with new leadership at the top we’ll get the funding we need to both be safe and open."
14052,"California is now [2nd](https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#cases_casesper100klast7days) in the country by cases per 100,000 people."
14053,Where are all the people saying it only looked bad because California is so populated?
14054,"And more importantly, where will they move the goalpost this time?"
14055,"Honestly, still not enough."
14056,We need to get to at least twice that in order to get to something like normal life by summer.
14057,C'mon man you know we're not trying at all.
14058,You don't even have to ask
14059,Stay strong.
14060,"New Yorker here, who lived through 24 hour sirens during March and April."

14069,"*Released on the US Embassy’s official website on Jan 4, the alert says that Americans should “consider returning to your country of residence immediately using whatever commercial means available”."
14070,"*

Wonder if it means for Americans that has residence for Malaysia but currently in US to return to Malaysia immediately :p. 

Most metrics suggest US doing much worse than Malaysia in terms of infection risk and fatalities."
14071,"You realize that every manufacturer is profiting off their kits, right?"
14072,They all charge a markup.
14073,In fact I’m willing to bet they make a lot more when sold through health plans and paid via insurance.
14074,"Likewise, the distributors of those kits are taking a markup as well."
14075,"In fact, basically everything is done at a profit, regardless of what it is or where you’re getting it from."
14076,"And if it’s done by a non-profit or government agency, it likely involved sourcing from for profit sources and contractors who were paid with tax dollars."
14077,Welcome to America.
14078,R = 1.25 compared to 0.85 before.
14079,That is very unfortunate 🙃
14080,There shouldn't have been an option to take the masks off in the first place.
14081,Your always going to have morons that will actually do it.
14082,What does that have to do with Palestinians?
14083,"The Palestinians run their own healthcare system, ordered their own vaccines and will be distributing them."
14084,"Once Israel is done with their own civilians, Arabs included, they will aid the Palestinians at their own cost."
14085,But own citizens come first.
14086,[removed]
14087,Could they buy oxygen from welding gas suppliers?
14088,"Jews and Palestinians are of the same race, just FYI."
14089,And 15% of Israel's citizens have Arab roots.
14090,My school goes back full time next week.
14091,The part that frustrates me is it's the success of our hybrid model both academically and controlling the spread that is fueling this change.
14092,It's like people are willingly ignoring the fact that we are managing things well because of the restrictions we currently have in place.
14093,&gt;Dr Michael Ryan from WHO said the officials were not given visa clearances; one official was sent back home and the other is staying in a third country until China grants entry.
14094,"&gt;  
&gt;""We trust and we hope that this is just a logistic and bureaucratic issue \[and\] will be resolved very quickly,"" he said."
14095,You don't depart when there is no valid visa on your passport.
14096,WHO staff is no exception.
14097,Sending them out without finishing the visa clearance is basically looking for trouble.
14098,Shut the fuck up.
14099,I don't have the energy to argue with people like you anymore.
14100,I'm so fucking tired of fearing how bad this will get before people like you start taking it seriously.
14101,You shouldn't have to get it to take it seriously

14106,"When the options are get them or you can’t open, the choice is clear."
14107,We can focus on certain key areas.
14108,"One angle they don't mention is, how many people might have been affected with COVID already."
14109,"I was diagnosed a few weeks ago, lucky to have gotten through it fine."
14110,"There have been plenty of studies that suggest natural immunity is holding strong 6 months later - the way I see it, at the rate that things are going with the distribution, I probably wouldn't qualify for a vaccine until June, and knowing I have some sort of immunity (temporary or otherwise) means I'd gladly give up my spot for an individual who hasn't had it, if I qualify sooner for whatever reason."
14111,"And If immunity proves to decline, then I'll happily get my vaccine in the future if need be."
14112,"No, it's just 'triage'."
14113,Review your NIMS protocols.
14114,Threshold.... anyone watch Scott Pilgrim vs the World?
14115,"I've been living in Vietnam for 4 years, it was funny at first when people didn't believe Vietnam's numbers claiming that they were hiding or not testing enough."

14301,Felt run down after 18 hours and arm hurt for several days.
14302,Pretty consistent among all of them too.
14303,I have never seen a food vending machine in a ER as long as I have gone to one.

14310,They all have rather robust local economy and are not dependent on tourism.
14311,"Besides, there are other countries and global powers in that part of the world that have managed the pandemic well."
14312,The countries in that region could open to each other to varying degrees.
14313,Absolutely correct however it was the distribution vaccines by the HHS under Trump because they didn't meet the  20 million vaccination goals by the end of 2020. r/Politics the Reddit that you looking for for the political discussion for Coronavirus distribution
14314,I was wondering this too.
14315,"Like, are we possibly in a situation where the world is about to fully exhaust its supply of ready tanks of oxygen until this is over?"
14316,Because things like that are what get you to win the game Pandemic.
14317,"I agree with everything you are saying, especially about some places such as China, NZ, Singapore, etc."
14318,I am upset and am down with the situation here in my country.
14319,Sorry if I brought people down here with my pessimism.
14320,"I appreciate you, man!"
14321,(Love the No Country For Old Men reference as well)
14322,"The downvotes are becauss he is wrong in the context of the post he is replying to, which is ""if you can't get it in the right arm then any arm is better than no arm"", but he is responding like the comment was ""all arms are as good as each other for saving lives""."
14323,"So no, he gets a downvote for misrepresenting what was said."
14324,"While it is not 100% clear that this violates any of the Florida government's guidelines for distributing the vaccine, given that the donors in question are within the proper age group, it certainly stands in stark contrast to the ""camp out in line"" approach being forced on the general population of elderly Floridians."
14325,"The basic gist of it for anyone encountering a paywall:

&gt; MorseLife has made difficult-to-get coronavirus vaccines — provided through a federal program intended for residents and staff of long-term-care facilities — available not just to its residents but to those who made generous donations to the facility, including members of the Palm Beach Country Club, according to multiple people who were offered access, some of whom accepted it."
14326,"The precise number of invitations, and how many may have gone to non-donors, could not be learned."
14327,"&gt; But the arrangement, in appearing to rely on a program run by chain pharmacies for long-term-care facilities, may have violated national immunization guidelines, as well as state protocols, even though state officials, speaking on the condition of anonymity to address sensitive matters, acknowledged that the rules have not been spelled out clearly enough by Gov."
14328,Ron DeSantis (R).
14329,&gt; The episode highlights how the country’s patchwork approach to immunization against the coronavirus — leaving decisions about eligibility to state and local authorities as well as to individual providers — is creating opportunities for facilities to provide access to well-connected people while thousands of others wait in line.
14330,"In Florida, some elderly residents have camped out overnight in hopes of receiving a shot."
14331,"&gt; Top health personnel in Palm Beach County did not sanction the vaccinations of nonresidents at MorseLife, according to a health official who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss it."
14332,"The official was shocked to learn that members of the public, even those of advanced age, were given priority access to immunization at the facility while others wait in line for appointments at sites set up by the county."

14334,Like SARS?
14335,We’ll be fine.
14336,The current estimates are assuming no new vaccines get approved.
14337,J&amp;J effectively increases supply by 50% and AZ will even more
14338,Um.
14339,What?
14340,The Republican party are not terrorists...they just have different values.
14341,The Taliban and ISIS were terrorizing their own countries civilians long before they became America's problem.
14342,"They killed anyone who opposed them, took away womens rights."
14343,These groups are equivalent to what it would be like if white supremacist militia groups like the Proud Boys gained enough power to over throw state governments and started terrorizing and killing the civilians who lived in those states.
14344,Then invaded other states stripping people of their rights and killed anyone who opposed them.
14345,The US army and other foreign military were/are positioned in Iraq and Afghanistan to prevent that from happening further in those countries.
14346,This is absolutely worrying and I do have a feeling it's just going to get worse because some of those veteran Affairs facilities where these Vets go to have COVID-19 outbreaks
14347,I wish our teachers would do something similar.
14348,I've been forced into face to face instruction all year and so has my husband.
14349,I literally go home every day worried that I've been exposed to Covid.
14350,I hate this and no one seems to care about what is happening to teachers.

14357,You’d have thought that the months of preparation for this moment would have enabled a more efficient rollout.
14358,Turns out that without an American NHS we’re just fucked.
14359,Am I wrong or WHO to this day still rejects aerosol spread?
14360,i feel like the istitutions that are supposed to look for us are a bit of broken
14361,I know we're only 5 days after NYE but we're 11 days after Christmas.
14362,Would we have started seeing the holiday surge yet?
14363,Keeping my fingers crossed but it seems like cases have been steady.
14364,My grandma's nursing home went 9 months without an outbreak.
14365,She was scheduled to get her vaccine tomorrow.
14366,"Today she got diagnosed with COVID, after 30 others did in the last week during the nursing home's first outbreak."
14367,"She's going to die, through no fault of her own, because one patient-facing employee brought it in a week before vaccination."
14368,"She's going to die alone in an unfamiliar room due to no fault of her own, from unnatural causes."
14369,Stay home.
14370,Wear a fucking mask.
14371,Stay home.
14372,Just stay home.
14373,Imagine if they were offered money to take the vaccine more people would be lining up for it.
14374,They should be done with healthcare workers by now.
14375,This is not encouraging.
14376,"Exactly lol, I get the whole ""let's place 100% of the blame on trump and the administration"" cause they've been doing a piss poor job, but it's real navie to think that a few words here and a few tweets there would suddenly fix america's stupidity."
14377,People were denying covid as they were dying in the hospital lol a tweet is not going to change their minds
14378,How come China is not mentioned?
14379,"They're the true masters of COVID, being a non-island nation of 1.2 billion that is the center of the global economy."
14380,They're the ones playing 4D chess.
14381,Agreed.
14382,Certainly a good predictor for a great number of things related to this pandemic.
14383,"I'm wondering, however, if there's something in the nature of viruses that cause them to behave in the way that OP states."
14384,"One could rationalise that, sure, but I'm particularly interested in reading into more empirical evidence behind this."
14385,The great influenza by John Barry.
14386,"Most viruses want to survive, if they kill their host to fast then they can’t spread to many more host."
14387,"So they tend to mutate to a less lethal form and typically also mutate to a more contagious version as a response to buffers we put in place to try and curb its spread, which is what is happening now with Uk variant."
14388,1918 flu mutated to the version we have today that is far less lethal and still pretty contagious.
14389,"When I was at jury duty, they said, they will let one refusal slide and on the second they issue a ticket."

14396,"Or I'm a person who isn't living in a world of total fear, and instead of going to extremes, I'm just willing to take reasonable precautions."
14397,The government keeps a second dose and ships it when needed so providers don’t have to save any.
14398,"So if a hospital gets some doses today, they’ll get a shipment with the same number in 21 or 28 days, depending on the vaccine manufacturer (probably a little sooner since second doses can be administered +/- a few days of the recommended interval."
14399,I heard +/- 4 days is acceptable).

14416,There was a riot on the streets.
14417,Where were you?
14418,Unfortunately this is mainly true for viruses where the death of the host impacts its chances of transmission.
14419,But Covid is infectious before the onset of symptoms up to few days later.
14420,So if the host later dies or not is irrelevant to the spread of the virus.

14473,"The concern is a long incubation/early shedding period before symptoms present or worsen, followed by more lethal/quicker mortality rate."
14474,"It gets parrotted far too often here that more lethal always means less spread, when those factors can be independent."
14475,The virus can technically mutate to have more spread and more/quicker lethality by having a longer and more consistent incubation period where the spread occurs before symptomatic.

14596,"On the other hand, their mutation rates are an exploitable Achilles’ heel: researchers and clinicians can increase RNA virus mutation rates using nucleoside analogues, and a 3–5-fold increase in mutation rate causes lethal mutagenesis in human-infecting viruses like poliovirus and influenza \[[12](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6107253/#pbio.3000003.ref012), [13](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6107253/#pbio.3000003.ref013)\]."
14597,"The exogenous mutagen causes enough additional mutations, which are often deleterious, so that the progeny RNA viruses are of lower fitness, eventually leading to ecological collapse of the population \[[14](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6107253/#pbio.3000003.ref014)\]."
14598,"Another way in which researchers have seen the constraints imposed by the high mutation rate of RNA viruses is in their limited genome size—the mutation rates per nucleotide are too high to increase their genome size without having a higher per-genome accumulation of mutations \[[9](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6107253/#pbio.3000003.ref009), [15](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6107253/#pbio.3000003.ref015)\]."
14599,Researchers have suggested that RNA virus mutation rates have evolved to be just under the threshold for lethal mutagenesis (sometimes referred to as error threshold \[[16](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6107253/#pbio.3000003.ref016)\]) but that selection for genetic diversity and other consequences of a high mutation rate push RNA viruses to near their catastrophic limits.
14600,It has been hard to assess this assumption and verify that RNA viruses have their optimal mutation rates due to natural selection on mutation rate.

14604,I wouldn't trust software developed with a new framework in half the regular time as an engineer.
14605,Not really.
14606,This isn’t about helping the people who are most likely to get well.
14607,It’s about maximizing the number of people who can get well.
14608,"This is why most systems of triage has something like:
Healthy (Green)
Help soon (Yellow)
Help now (Red)
Can’t help (Black)

And who is in which group depends on how many medical personnel you have compared to patients."
14609,"If one person needs CPR, and everyone else has nasty bruising, you give CPR."
14610,"If you have one person who needs CPR, three who are losing a dangerous amount of blood, some sprained ankles, you might prioritize the people bleeding first, since it might take less effort to stabilize someone dying of blood loss, leaving the person who needs CPR to die."
14611,"(Or more accurately, to remain dead since they would already be dead if you are administering CPR)  By prioritizing the people who aren’t in quite as much danger, you help the most people live through it."
14612,"You prioritize people who are Red, from my earlier example."
14613,"Reverse triage is not quite the same thing, because it prioritizes care to people who will be the quickest to be released early, which are the yellows from my example scale."
14614,"By prioritizing the yellows you can either get them out of hospital beds, or on the battlefield you can get them up and holding a gun."

14626,Wife only saw him once on video the last month and now she’ll never see him alive.
14627,"Dude was a mans man, served two tours in Vietnam, injured both times (spent weeks on end in the hospital), awarded two Purple Hearts..... it’s like the country who supposedly supports their troops doesn’t really care about their vets."

14637,Same.
14638,I am quite surprised how low the price is haha.
14639,You didn't know that but you're confident enough to claim things about mRNA tech that's easily disputed in 40 seconds of researching?
14640,I'm sorry I seem aggressive but its aggravating.
14641,&gt; There are probably other biological functions it could touch that I am not educated on but those are the ones that I worry about with the knowledge I have.
14642,If a single virologist/pharmacists(?
14643,as far as I know) aren't worried about those things with their education/real world experience.
14644,I think you need more supporting/fleshed out theories more in depth than basic questions from you would find in a basic university biology sequence.
14645,"Likely all the concerns you have, independent panels/scientists all over the world have probably asked/answered those questions already way way more in depth than you/I could ever come close without getting a PHD in virology research."
14646,"&gt; I come from a family that has a hard time with experimental drugs

I'm sorry that your family has but spreading misinformation on the internet hurts people."

14648,Vaccination shoukd be mandatory

14651,"Also, dick noses, totally stealing that."
14652,Stay safe!
14653,So why can't they bring forward the date to open to 1B?
14654,"Like once \~80% of 1A has either been vaccinated or declined, they should move on to the next priority."

14661,Lol - everything in the store is (up to) 50% off.
14662,"Actually, it’s just this pack of gum."
14663,This is also without J&amp;J's vaccine.
14664,"Assuming it gets approved and assuming it's as effective as, say, Sputnik (similar adenovirus vector), then we're going to do mass vaccinations through CVS/Walgreens/RiteAid without any deep freeze logistics issues."

14675,Im not sure how it is in sweden.
14676,But switzerland counts every death of a person with active Covid (pcr confirmed) in the statistic.

14681,😃 Keep at it bro
14682,Why is every single article I see nowadays completely unnecessary.
14683,I think a tier system is necessary to prevent a mad rush and chaos.
14684,"The issue is that when planning to disburse to the priority tiers, they didn't expect so many people to turn it down."
14685,"Let's say there's 10 million people with jobs that qualify them to receive the vaccine, and 90 million people who don't have priority."
14686,"Because of how polarized society is, [40%](https://www.npr.org/2021/01/01/952716705/some-health-care-workers-are-hesitant-about-getting-covid-19-vaccines) of the 10 million reject the vaccine."
14687,"That frees up 4 million doses, but maybe 36 million people in the general population want those 4 million doses ASAP."
14688,You don't want the 6 million health workers who do want the vaccine to have to queue or do fastest-fingers-first to get ahead of 56 million gen pop who want it.
14689,I think they just needed to over-schedule the priority people and get their understanding that it's not a perfect system and they might have to come back tomorrow.
14690,"It's just a lot of manpower is needed to manage the system, man phones and name lists etc."
14691,I’m sorry; I’m a bit pessimistic but also a realist.

14694,I haven't seen my parents in person since my mom was released from the hospital - she got out and we went into lock down the next day.

14715,"They did virtual appointments for a few weeks, then decided it was safe to go in person again."
14716,"I’ve been begging them to stop going to church, at the very least, since it is one of the more dangerous places to go, but they won’t."
14717,"They did virtual mass at first, but now think the safety precautions the church is taking are good enough."
14718,"My immediate family isolates fully, and would like to be able to go over to see them weekly, but they won’t compromise, so I don’t feel safe bringing the kids over to see them."

14749,"This quote from the expert the guy you replied to gave was not even a valid criticism, not only was the nytimes article widely critiqued (e.g by BMJ editor)
as being misleading (it was) and the experts response was based on gross misunderstanding of the purpose of the ""mix and match"" guidelines (it  was a contingency planning document not a promotion of a lucky dip moving forward)  , the articles author and the interviewed expert both admitted they had no clue the UK was running a heterologous prime boost (aka mix match) vaccine trial."
14750,The UK is the only country in the world thus far to bother with this important research.
14751,"Therefore his suggestion that UK 'abandoned science' and is 'trying to guess their way out of a mess' is absolutely absurd, based on ignorance."
14752,"It's was a dangerous thing to say, just like Faucis suggestion UK rushed pfizer approval that he later had to walk back ."
14753,"Hetrologous prime boost is a valid scientific approach to bolstering vaccine immunogecity, the idea has strong merit."
14754,chadox vector has been used in past with good results.
14755,"It's expected combination of AZ and pfizer could generate stronger, more durable immunity than two individual doses of pfizer or two of AZ."
14756,"(In part because pfizer give stronger ab but weaker t cell response and vice versa) hence why the clinical trials are run 

I have explained this so many times with the person you're responding to, as well as correcting their misinformation on dose schedule regimens but they persist with promoting the idea (including by doctoring statements and quotes ) that UK is acting like a reckless banana republic."
14757,Appreciate you trying here  but I think the effort with this one is wasted.
14758,I heard today unused vaccines are thrown out or be subject to a fine if they give the vaccine to anyone younger than 70!
14759,even if they have vaccinated every qualified person in their hospital and have a few left over!
14760,It's shocking the government would rather do that than let someone get it.
14761,(although I agave no doubt the ultra rich receive cuz privilege) I am 50 and have not worked since March because I am a facialist and massage therapist.
14762,"We are very hands on, and rather than dealing with people refusing to wear masks and facing an even more contagious mutation many therapists and practices are not taking clients."

14879,"indefinitely for many, as it will only end when it kills them."
14880,Why do you limit yourself to a single research that limits its scope when you're provided with other research from credible sources that went further in their analysis?
14881,"Pfizer themselves mention with stats that immunity is around 90% past 14 days after the first dose, the INSPQ got 92.7% after analysing Pfizer's numbers to build their vaccination plan."
14882,"Your source admits that ""The cumulative incidence of Covid-19 cases over time among placebo and vaccine recipients begins to diverge by 12 days after the first dose, 7 days after the estimated median viral incubation period of 5 days,10 indicating the early onset of a partially protective effect of immunization."""
14883,but then use the 52.7% number that includes people that had been vaccinated less than 12 days prior.
14884,"Their analysis can't be used to have an idea of the resulting immunity from a single dose, they say so themselves ""The study was not designed to assess the efficacy of a single-dose regimen."
14885,""", then you are wrong to use their analysis to make a conclusion on the efficacy of a single dose regimen as it wasn't the goal of their analysis, it was the INSPQ's goal though."
14886,Seatbelt laws aren’t for your the person wearing it’s sake.
14887,"It’s so if you do get in an accident, it’s less likely that it’s serious enough to occupy resources like an ambulance that we have a finite supply of and can’t be scaled up at a moments notice."
14888,Just wanted to clear that up
14889,It’s absolutely a combined and coordinated (as much as possible) response.
14890,"Access to money and other coordinated support systems as well: interest only mortgage repayments/freezes, eviction moratoriums, pid sick leave specifically for covid, easy access to quick testing facilities and getting results back promptly, widespread testing, contact tracing, communication/marketing about what to do (government sponsored ads with instructions on how to wash hands for example), restricting interstate movements, increased mental health support, living wage applied for unemployed, employment support for impacted businesses that directly paid salaries, etc, etc, etc."
14891,There isn’t one silver bullet.
14892,"It’s not just wear a mask, not just lock down but coordinated focused efforts everywhere possible."
14893,"Agreed, this is the last administration really fucked us by not taking the virus seriously."
14894,It’s now at a point where I literally don’t think it’s possible to contain the virus except through herd immunity through the vaccine.
14895,Doesn’t matter who controls the government now.
14896,"First level ""Kontakt"" (Contact)"
14897,Previous years?
14898,Or just things like the ongoing Israeli treatment of Palestinians.
14899,Well put.
14900,"If it helps, APA revised their guidelines on screen time."
14901,"They still don't want kids under 18 months watching tv (though you might not have a choice), but have softened guidelines for those over 6."
14902,"From an education perspective, you just don't want screens to replace human interaction."
14903,"If you could be talking, reading, or singing to them, if they could be playing with you or other kids - APA wants them developing those coordination and language skills."
14904,"However, when mom and dad are working, your options for those kinds of interactions are limited."
14905,"Promote reading or toys, if that's possible."
14906,"When is not, just choose the most meaningful screen time that you can (sesame street, khan academy, etc.)"
14907,and maximize your non-screen interactions with them after work.
14908,Yeah there’s still Trump signs and flags up in their neighborhood.
14909,My parents live in the same neighborhood my sister’s family lives in and her kids did their remote learning at my parent’s house.
14910,"Now my parents have decided they won’t see the kids until after my parents have been vaccinated, thankfully they’re on a waitlist for the vaccine."

14920,And that solves this problem how?
14921,By turning an original 2 week lockdown into 16 months?
14922,Places are closed and people are fucked beyond belief.
14923,Even with the appropriate messaging the social contract in the US is go to work or don't get any help.
14924,"When you're asking people to sacrifice food on the table and money in their pocket by staying home they simply aren't going to, even if they wanted to."

14927,Palestine has never officially existed.

14929,Pretty sure the mortality rate went down in the US too
14930,So they are injecting millions of people with a substance that may not even achieve the very result it was created for?
14931,Incredible... And people just shrug thier shoulders and assume all is well.
14932,Pointless for 80% of the planet if it doesn't provide immunity.
14933,Let's simply ignore that though.
14934,"Ok, sorry man but you've run out of troll phrases."
14935,Gotta give it to you though.
14936,"Once this pandemic is over, you should consider stand-up comedy or something."
14937,I believe the median time from infection to mortality is more like 3-4 weeks.
14938,"I think it was mostly culture + messaging that made the difference, emphasis on culture."
14939,"Another huge, huge factor was initial inoculum of infected individuals when the world caught on to what was happening."
14940,"For context, Australia took ~6 months to rid themselves of COVID in Melbourne and ~3 months elsewhere."
14941,"They had, at max, 7000 active cases (not per day, that's the most cases they had at one time)."
14942,New Zealand had far less than that.
14943,The US had millions by mid-March.
14944,I don't think it's reasonable to say the US could have avoided this *unless* Trump had taken it seriously in January/February.
14945,"However, it's hard to ignore that basically all of Asia did well with this, even in countries where the government did absolutely nothing (e.g."
14946,Japan).
14947,"That has to be linked to mask compliance, general hygiene, respect, etc..."
14948,There are a lot of things that work really well in other countries that don't work well in the US.
14949,We're going to need a shift in culture before we can successfully implement any of it.
14950,"&gt;No offense, but you as well seem to be searching for a prerational reasons to reject the idea, here engaging in ad hominem."

14958,Wow scary.
14959,Worst part is seeing the government so clearly lying about it.
14960,"This is why it's important to hold government accountable every single time when caught lying, otherwise it becomes so common it's just accepted."
14961,"When you let them lie and get away with it, it just becomes normal and then stuff like this happens."
14962,I feel awful for those nurses and the families of the dead.
14963,Heard they arrested the person who recorded and showed the truth too.
14964,Very shameful
14965,&gt; it is a lot quicker for them to take an hour and walk down the hall than almost anyone else.
14966,Quicker?
14967,Sure.
14968,But that's not really the metric.
14969,It's going to be much less burdensome for a retired person to go take their two (or 6) hours of their mostly free day to go get vaccinated than the healthcare worker who is tired from a 12 hour day and just wants to go sleep before their next 12 hour day.
14970,"Not quite sure what ""familiar with a site that provides healthcare"" means, as just about every adult in this country is going to be familiar with a pharmacy (likely a drive-through one) and/or a primary care clinic."
14971,"This article is an example of deaths which are probably caused by the pandemic, but not by the virus itself."
14972,"There seem to be a lot of different sources of such deaths (suicides, starvation in developing countries, missed screenings for various diseases, etc.)."
14973,"When all is said and done it will be interesting, in a sort of morbid way, to see whether the virus itself or the second-order effects were more deadly."
14974,AFAIK people are ignoring the CA lockdown rules.
14975,I remember that thread!
14976,Small ~~world~~ Reddit.
14977,Interesting that it mostly mentions how the lack of tourism is killing the economies tourist dependent small pacific island countries.
14978,I think a more interesting point to be made is that the simple measure of stopping incoming travelers and social distancing allowed these countries to remain COVID free.
14979,The same reasons why NZ and Australia are also doing well.
14980,"The ""criticism"" came about an year late."
14981,Advocating taking property from those you disagree with and selling them in to slavery?
14982,Reddit moment
14983,But there was no Tiananmen Square massacre.
14984,[removed]
14985,I wonder how much of this is still catch up from holiday reporting lags?
14986,"It almost certainly was China, the first major outbreak was in China, basic logic and epidemiology would say the odds that originated in Italy and exported to China leading to them having the first epidemic are incredibly low."
14987,Because someone wants to look good and get re-elected.
14988,Hastily reopen everything.
14989,"Shit likes this happens all the time right now, and in another thread I was in, people were defending sports being played still."
14990,sigh.

14992,That sounds like reality.
14993,Sorry no snow here either.
14994,We are supposed to get some this weekend though.
14995,I remembered The Netherlands from the conversation were someone said America was the greatest country in the world because it's the only country with freedom of speech...
14996,So we posted the global rankings and you were #6
14997,"So true, we need to make each country divide itself into 4.8 million population islands to really beat the next pandemic."
14998,It's the only way.
14999,My state of Texas is gonna have to become at least 6 different countries.
15000,How much could a rent cost?
15001,$300?

15004,"You’ll most likely be fine, but obviously make sure to completely self isolate!"
15005,I hope you and your girlfriend get well soon ❤️
15006,I remember reports of an investigation into mobile freezer units being contaminated.
15007,"One of the infected worked unloading them, and they suspected the virus could have been frozen in the container, then when the ice crystals melt, the virus hangs in the water vapor."
15008,Don't know what became of that though.
15009,"oh don't worry, we have plenty of suckers."
15010,"Depending on the pay, it might be tempting lol"
15011,I could not agree with you more sir.
15012,Unfortunately we have some restrictions in what we can do based on where we live.
15013,Tl:dr do whatever you need to to be happy.
15014,Sont let anyone stand in the way of you being happy.
15015,But don't take happiness at the expense of innocent bystanders.
15016,The only person who should be slighted are the ones taking away our freedoms of the world.
15017,Because they try to take away our freedoms their happiness is expendable.
15018,But not in the physical harm way ya feel?
15019,Everybody love everybody its on the fucking wall.
15020,We need to take care of ourselves under those rules.
15021,If their rules violate your beliefs or values then you should find a way to change the rules or don't get caught breaking the rules.
15022,If money is what it takes then do whatever you can to learn to make the most money so that you can pay more than the corrupt people behind the scenes pulling strings.
15023,Then you can try to help others.
15024,If the powerful want capitalism exploit the fuck out of it and if you don't agree with it change it when you can so that you feel your government does represent you.
15025,If you cannot find or fund a suitable leader learn more to get there.
15026,Or be in charge yourself.
15027,But money and time is all it takes.
15028,And knowledge is all you need for money and time.
15029,So use the experts and genius people around you to gain personal growth.
15030,Then when you can make a change to your immediate surroundings to have your values/beliefs met until you can't do so without hurting anyone.
15031,Do whatever it takes to be happy in your life just don't do so at the expense of true harm to others.
15032,Don't cut off my hand to get a tv.
15033,But if its life or death for you cut off my hand.
15034,Understand that I will not sit by idly while you do so but I'm not going to tell you how to be happy.
15035,Just be fucking happy.
15036,Or be sad I donþ really give a shit.
15037,I'd prefer everyone happy though.
15038,It is literally the driving force behind every extremist group.
15039,They just don't draw a line at success due to the expense of others.
15040,Utilitarianism is technically the most efficient practice.
15041,Thats my opinion.
15042,I would love to know your opinion on this truly.
15043,Flavian fake news.
15044,Nero played the Lyre.
15045,The fiddle wasn't invented until the tenth century.
15046,"He also was not in Rome during the fire, and organized a relief effort when he returned to the city."
15047,Big takeaway: Nero was a better leader than Trump.
15048,I wish someone would make a list of the hospitals that did this.
15049,Kinda goes against the Hippocratic oath no?

15075,I wish Canada could put some more distance between us and America with its Fox News idiocy.
15076,Trump and Fox News are responsible for most of our problems here.
15077,It's like they found a way to digitize brain worms and broadcast it across the border.
15078,I'll believe it when I see it.
15079,These types of articles put forth a theoretical possibility with very little say from anyone with real authority.
15080,"Here we have some guy who owns ""Vacation Superstore Network, Best Price Cruises, and Vogue Vacations"" and the existence of an app hoping to capitalize on the possibility."
15081,"It's certainly going to be required for some international travel, but beyond that I don't think it will be a reality domestically in the US."
15082,"Especially with our fragmented health care system and the tech literacy of older generations, businesses will have to turn away not just unvaccinated people but anyone who doesn't jump through the hoops to connect some electronic medical record to a smart phone app, or anyone who just doesn't trust their data with it."
15083,Movie theaters and the live events industry will have endured a year and half of practically no revenue.
15084,I don't think they're going to take on this project.
15085,Concerts even resuming would necessitate a high level of herd immunity and the benefit of such a pass for public health doesn't even seem clear.
15086,We're not going to trap unvaccinated people into quarantine.
15087,&gt; Did I miss something ?
15088,"Yes, you did."
15089,A lot of things.
15090,The hardest part would be the track+trace system which ended up being a disaster.
15091,Closing borders completely could be difficult but I'm sure there's a plan of action for that somewhere.
15092,I'm sure there's hotels at every airport which could have been used to house people for 14 days.
15093,"As for getting cases down to 0, we almost did but still had open borders, shit track+trace, and no forced quarantine."
15094,"Honestly as much as people say their freedoms are being taken away, I think it's the government's fear of people being upset that they can't do stuff which has been the cause of half arsed policies."
15095,Can't make it compulsory to wear a mask because people will scream about their human rights so all the government can/will do is advise that they're necessary.
15096,Can't force someone into quarantine who's just come back from Wuhan because they'll scream about their human rights so all the government can/will do is advise that it's necessary and trust that they do it at home.
15097,"The one time the Tories could have lived up to its reputation of being cutthroat arseholes and they fucked it up, what a surprise"
15098,Definitely could be.
15099,There is also the chance that this is from everyone's routine vaccination schedules being thrown off.
15100,"During the origonal shutdown, a lot of kids missed shots they would have normally gotten, because the regular pediatricians simply weren't doing them and the county health departments (at least locally) closed their clinics too."
15101,"We have pretty bad spikes of whooping cough and of course flu, even in years when everything is running normally, and this year, it still isn't."
15102,"We're now in 5th place in the Western world in deaths/million, just passed Spain----Belgium 1707, Italy 1263, Czech Republic 1160, UK 1121, US 1102, Spain 1100"
15103,cool cool cool
15104,Over 70 is spread out some with an increased chance of limited mobility.
15105,Health care professionals are more likely to be already to be in a health care setting or at least familiar with a site that provides healthcare.
15106,"While they are busy, it is a lot quicker for them to take an hour and walk down the hall than almost anyone else."
15107,Airports I could see as they already have staff for that sort of job.
15108,Movie theaters no possible way
15109,"It took quite a while for it to increase in the UK, once it breached a percentage - almost exponential increase."
15110,"Remember it was first detected in September, only became a readable percentage by late November."
15111,"So they've gone from ""two weeks to flatten the curve"" to ""lockdown indefinitely"", even after the vaccine has been distributed (chief medical officer Chris Whitty has said that there will still be restrictions next winter https://news.sky.com/story/covid-19-some-covid-restrictions-could-return-next-winter-chief-medical-officer-warns-12180133)."
15112,"I hope people will remember this the next time the government proposes a ""two week"" or ""four week"" lockdown to ""flatten the curve"" or ""break the circuit"" or ""save Christmas"" or whatever."
15113,"I hate to say it, but come to think of it, pretty much this exact thing happened in Arizona."
15114,"Around 2017, they fired a *ton* of teachers and just lowered the bar to being one, increased class sizes, and had long term subs fill the gap, if I recall correctly."
15115,You can totally fire 40% of teachers if the community is fine with just churning out a bunch of uneducated idiots.
15116,"The lockdowns were aggressive, but then the political leaders of California ignored them, quite obviously."
15117,"So if the people telling everyone to do something are ignoring it, why shouldn’t John Q."
15118,Public?
15119,"There is absolutely zero places in america that are on ""full lockdown""."
15120,"In the spring, the only place that was even close to that was NYC."
15121,nowhere else in the US has even come close.
15122,I don't know why this...after every god-damned thing else... Is what broke me.
15123,"my heart absolutely aches for these people, their families, and the medical staff who were powerless to watch this happen."

15135,That would be guaranteed to be called racist/new Jim Crow
15136,That would be the National Guard here but they're not all trained for medical stuff
15137,"Vietnam does more tests per confirmed case than any country, by far."
15138,Vietnam shares a land border with China.
15139,Singapore is densely populated and a massive transport hub right in the geographical firing line.
15140,Taiwan had the foresight to pounce on this thing on NYE 2019.
15141,China is a nation of billions and they have squashed this thing.
15142,Why couldn't/didn't Ireland functionally isolate?
15143,The simple answer to stopping covid-19 is cultural will.
15144,That's it.
15145,For every excuse people put up about Europe or the USA....
15146,I can point to a country of similar demographics/geographics that has been successful.
15147,"US coronavirus research was closely tied to Wuhan, scientists here could offer as much insight on whether grafting spike proteins onto bat coronaviruses was feasible and or likely."
15148,"Unfortunately there seems to be a sort of code of academic silence, holding back the discussion because they fear backlash towards their own similar experimentation."
15149,I am not sure there's a connection between these people refusing to take the vaccine and overall vaccination rates.
15150,They may very well keep their jobs and even vaccinate people even if they don't take it themselves.
15151,"For the vaccination to really be effective they're going to have to recruit 10,000's of people to help administer the shots."

15162,How many can they administer per day?
15163,Most  non-physician health professionals (NPHPs) who are authorized to   provide preventive services seem to be overwhelmed in CA now.
15164,"(see [table 1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4841732/))  Unlike a flu shot that comes in ready-to-go vials, the Pfizer vaccine must be diluted with sodium  chloride solution and turned upside down and back again 10 times before  being injected."
15165,"In UK, two people need to check the dose beforehand and doctors are allocating around 8 minutes per shot, not including wait times."
15166,The  flu vaccine takes under a minute to administer.
15167,Doctors must monitor each patient for 15 minutes after the injection.
15168,"Hopefully, they didn't  shake the vial before administering the vaccine."
15169,"([instructions](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/covid-19/info-by-product/pfizer/index.html))

15171,"* *If the vial is shaken, discard the vaccine."

15179,"Vs thousands of random pro China propaganda on almost all social media platforms ever since the whole Hong Kong thing even more so, since Corona."
15180,"Since China has a closed internet, most voices heard will be “open up and let them investigate!”"
15181,"Once the vaccine is widely available, this sounds like a great idea !!!"
15182,However if this comes before young adults are able to get the vaccine it will be spitting in the face of the group that has sacrificed the most for the older generation.
15183,At that point I would expect and have no problems with the younger generation ignoring restrictions entirely.

15334,I would emphasize with your primary physician that you are willing to take the vaccine as soon as it's available and he/she is in the position to give it to you.
15335,I assume a large part of this will be through people's primary physicians as they know who has a big risk factor.

Among the six full-consensus NPI categories in the CCCSL, the largest impacts on Rt are shown by small gathering cancellations (83%, ΔRt between −0.22 and –0.35), the closure of educational institutions (73%, and estimates for ΔRt ranging from −0.15 to −0.21) and border restrictions (56%, ΔRt between −0.057 and –0.23)."
15727,"https://www.thelancet.com/journals/laninf/article/PIIS1473-3099(20)30785-4/fulltext

The relaxation of school closure was associated with the greatest increase in R on day 7 (R ratio 1·05, 95% CI 0·96–1·14) and day 14 (1·18, 1·02–1·36)."
15728,"These numbers are from before the UK variant went and shut those countries down, and it's already in the most populated states in the US which means things are going to become a god damn circus here."
15729,No.
15730,Idiots will cause it.
15731,You were instantly defensive when I said they don’t deserve to be commended
15732,The first one is free.
15733,After that.
15734,Pay up.
15735,"It’s useful to determine the relative impact to community, though."
15736,"First of all, genuine thanks for providing a real source."
15737,There is not enough of that on Reddit and the internet generally.
15738,"Having said that, while this particular paper does confirm that mice are capable of spreading it, it doesn't confirm that it is actually happening."
15739,"From the paper:

&gt;The extent to which these observations may translate to wild deer mouse populations remains unclear

But just because this paper doesn't confirm it doesn't mean that there isn't another paper out there that does."
15740,"Also, this paper seems to be from July, and things could have changed since then."
15741,"Not to mention, it has already spread through minks (and back to humans), so it's not like it's far-fetched for this type of thing to happen."
15742,Those are Russian Roulette numbers.

15744,"Effectively this means that the oxygen ran out, or the valves were purposefully (or accidentally I suppose) shut off."
15745,There should be a backup supply and another backup supply of oxygen.
15746,Alarms should sound if the first supply is low and automatically switch over to the first backup.
15747,The likelihood of a failure is very low.
15748,The pipes are not under massive pressure and should not catastrophically fail.
15749,"A single point can easily fail (be stuck in closed or open), but all points at the same time... No"
15750,Yes exactly.
15751,Where is “here”?

15765,"Doctors travel to other countries where they are most needed during pandemics **all the time**

The math is not clear, you’re making broad sweeping platitudes."
15766,You have opinions and nothing to back them up.
15767,What is the current surplus quantity of medical professionals in city X.
15768,How many lives can they save by spending a month in city Y.
15769,How will it impact the projected health of the citizens of city X.
15770,"You can Do this for all cities with a medical professional population over  Q and a general health over (potato) to save yourself time calculating “no” answers 

The only way your statement holds weight over the answers to those questions, whatever they may be, is if avoiding the appearance of impropriety has more ethical value than the preservation of life."
15771,Pherhaps you should just accept governments cannot predict the future.
15772,"Like the new UK mutation, that is super contagious."
15773,You should just get down with the fact that governments cannot predict such things.
15774,This can’t be a correlation.
15775,"Been to LA, pre-covid, heard sirens and helicopters the entire time I was there"
15776,"From article: “During a Jan. 5 interview with Newsday, Fauci was requested about whether or not the COVID vaccine will likely be made obligatory."
15777,The physician stated that he expects some places will mandate the vaccine.
15778,"“There will be individual institutions—they can be hospitals, they can be workplaces, they can be schools—where the authorities in charge of that say that in order to participate in the activities of this institution, you have to get vaccinated,” he defined.”"
15779,“China pull all funding from WHO”

15802,When you just HAVE to go to a movie theater during a pandemic but you’re afraid of science
15803,seasonality is less pronounced the closer to the equator you get.
15804,This pattern follows flu seasonality so I don’t see Brazil as an example contradicting this.
15805,"&gt;	Seasonality in mortality was most pronounced in southern states (winter epidemics, June–July), gradually attenuated toward central states (15°S) (p &lt; 0.001), and remained low near the equator."

‘I work in emergency healthcare staffing."
15821,"CEO's from hospitals are calling our staffing company in tears (and before the pandemic, WE were always the one calling them, trying to pitch our business."
15822,They never used to reach out to us).
15823,We have had to launch additional incentives and mental health services to keep our nurses from completely emotionally and physically collapsing.
15824,"We are seeing job orders with schedules guaranteed at 60+ hours, which is unprecedented."
15825,"We have 40,000 open job requests, and no more staff to send."
15826,And we don't even staff doctors or physicians - just nurses.
15827,Department of Health from many states are trying to launch their own programs to bring on more help.

15849,*
15850,The fear mongering about long term heart and lung damage on Reddit has been a sight to behold.
15851,A lot of the studies linked to this are not robust or show myocarditis and not “heart damage”.
15852,"I have spoken with an infectious disease specialist, and they said the probability of Covid causing permanent heart damage in a healthy young person is incredibly rare."
15853,Not to mention viruses affecting the heart is nothing new.
15854,Go over to r/covid19 and you’ll see a lot of skepticism towards the claim that this is a widespread thing.
15855,This is completely unfortunate.
15856,No they didn’t
15857,"Probably the highest risk groups would have been vaccinated, vaccinations for the general public would have started, and we would be mostly back to normal."
15858,It’s hard to keep being surprised by this news.
15859,"I mean, I live in LA and nobody gives a shit."
15860,"People out, stores not keeping patrons out due to being full, zero social distancing inside stores, employees afraid of saying something due to the fear of getting attacked by crazy idiots, employers still making people come in when they could work from home."
15861,This is just gonna get worse and worse.
15862,If the vaccine works then why the mandatory enforcement?
15863,This is how fascist regimes get started folks.
15864,"Excuse me, they havnt even proven these vaccines confer immunity."
15865,What are you talking about?
15866,There is also no proof that they actually prevent symptoms.
15867,They Efficacy they claim here is based on trial participants not having symptoms.
15868,"The participants were unchallenged with the virus, that's unethical."
15869,"Therefore they've no idea who, if any of the participants were even exposed to SARS-CoV-2."
15870,They then jump to a theoretical conclusion based on the data they have.
15871,95% Efficacy!
15872,Yay!
15873,"No, but you are at risk for a car accident and ICUs are full."
15874,Ah OK.
15875,Understood.
15876,You might want to reread your post
15877,A lot different especially if it was early September.
15878,Cases were low then so we might of got ahead of it and prevented this from being a significant wave completely by protecting enough people to slow the spread.
15879,Please do.
15880,In the private sector there’s accountability with the client when inefficiencies exist and time is wasted.
15881,Budgets balloon and that’s unacceptable.
15882,"In the public sector, there’s little accountability with the tax payers."

Stay safe out there"
15899,That's so sad!!!
15900,!
15901,All the doom and gloom seems totally unfounded right now.
15902,"With more and more people getting the vaccine, plus acquiring natural immunity, we have a clear path to herd immunity by summer."
15903,"Even with the UK and SA mutations which should not affect the vaccines’ efficacy very much, if at all."
15904,Yes.
15905,Extrapolation.
15906,"If you get infected a year ago and I check you for antibodies now, and you still have the majority of the antibodies left, we have every indication to believe that trend will continue, and there's not a ""OK, now drop all antibodies 366 days post infection"" coded into the viral DNA."
15907,"Based on 36,767 PCR tests."
15908,"I’m in a tangentially related industry, I know it’s not quick."
15909,"Converting existing lines, even if temporary, would be something they would explore as well."
15910,"ABSTRACT: It is unclear whether severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, which causes coronavirus disease 2019, can enter the brain."
15911,Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 binds to cells via the S1 subunit of its spike protein.
15912,"We show that intravenously injected radioiodinated S1 (I-S1) readily crossed the blood–brain barrier in male mice, was taken up by brain regions and entered the parenchymal brain space."
15913,"I-S1 was also taken up by the lung, spleen, kidney and liver."
15914,"Intranasally administered I-S1 also entered the brain, although at levels roughly ten times lower than after intravenous administration."
15915,"APOE genotype and sex did not affect whole-brain I-S1 uptake but had variable effects on uptake by the olfactory bulb, liver, spleen and kidney."
15916,I-S1 uptake in the hippocampus and olfactory bulb was reduced by lipopolysaccharide-induced inflammation.
15917,"Mechanistic studies indicated that I-S1 crosses the blood–brain barrier by adsorptive transcytosis and that murine angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 is involved in brain and lung uptake, but not in kidney, liver or spleen uptake."
15918,PERSONAL THOUGHTS: Obviously this is a mouse study and so the results should be taken with a giant grain of salt.
15919,"As we get to know COVID better, the neuropsychiatric symptoms (anosmia, stroke, confusion, headache, etc) are more apparent and established."
15920,Same here.
15921,The worst one I've ever had was getting my Hep B shots for work.
15922,Those were the only shots I dreaded getting.
15923,"Everything else I'm just like ""meh."""
15924,"&gt;	In most other countries there would have been debate, valid discussions with respect between both parties, and no personal cult followings."
15925,You read too much Daily Mail or Australian headlines my dude.
15926,"There is plenty of healthy debate of how things are managed, just as you would expect from a mature democravy."
15927,Why so you think there isn’t?
15928,You are obviously not Swedish so I’m questioning the whole *Swedes are like this or that* narrative.
15929,Nurses and doctors are exhausted **everywhere**.
15930,Norway has significantly lower transmission and yet elective care is being postponed and HCW are raising alarms all over.
15931,Why do you think this is something specific for Sweden?
15932,The reason Sweden is worse hit is that initial cases far exceeded those of the neighbors before measures were taken.
15933,Danish authorities estimate around 3000 daily cases nationwide in early April.
15934,Stockholm alone likely had 3-4k daily cases at that point.
15935,"Stockholms epidemic is the reason Swedish numbers in total are inflated, we were hit early and hard."
15936,"If Stockholms numbers had been like the rest of Sweden you wouldn’t have this fetish for Sweden as a whole, so start looking there."
15937,I wish everyone could get the top level care that the rich can buy themselves.
15938,&gt;The majority of them are more concerned with the process of how to make a decision rather than making a decision.
15939,I work amongst government employees and often try to explain the mentality to folks in the private sector because it can be just so foreign.
15940,This sums it up very well and I intend to steal it.
15941,It is utter process worship like you almost can't believe.
15942,more contagious doesn’t mean more deadly (usually correlates inversely actually).
15943,Regardless though it wouldn’t affect vaccine progress.
15944,"Mortality is down in the USA as well despite 300K Covid deaths so either social distancing completely stopped car accidents and the flu or numbers are just being shuffled around, I really have no idea how to make sense of this."
15945,I meant start to get to the 65 and old crowd- not start and finish.
15946,"Yes, the ones holding rallies, and constantly spouting conspiracy theories."

16031,u/Almedinz you didn't read the article.
16032,I still have my certificate and everything!
16033,"In other words, ""My conspiracy theories are falling apart, need more time to build up stories, brb"""
16034,I was reading about this a few days ago.
16035,"The issue is not ""running out"" of oxygen."
16036,The issue is that hospitals were not designed to pump this much oxygen through their pipes.
16037,"Oxygen comes in a frozen, liquid form, and then expands to a gas on-site."
16038,This gas form is still very cold.
16039,How cold?
16040,"Well, it's cold enough that - given how many covid patients there are, and the fact that covid patients need nearly 10x the amount of oxygen that normal ""on oxygen"" patients need - the gas oxygen is freezing the pipes that distribute it throughout the hospitals."
16041,"Once frozen, the gas just stays liquid and never makes it to the people who need it."
16042,"The hospitals have been getting creative to make things work, adding heat to the pipes, moving all covid patients to lower floors (because apparently the longer pipe runs to the upper floors freeze more often), and so on."
16043,"So unfortunately, they can't just buy more O2 to solve the problem, aside from buying tons and tons of stand alone containers to put next to each bed (which they are doing, too, in some cases)."
16044,Please wear your masks and only go out if you absolutely must.
16045,"My mother said to me if I neglect my health, she would disown me."
16046,She had already experienced that with my father...
16047,I thought she was kidding.
16048,"She saw me after two years and said I was obese, go get ‘a physical’."
16049,I had to see a doctor on her threat to realize I was obese.
16050,I lost the weight (it took a year).
16051,I don’t want to be careless about my health just because there is treatment available?
16052,The healthcare systems can’t  save me (easily) if I don’t live a healthier lifestyle.
16053,Do I want to live free and take insulin later or live disciplined and delay the drugs?
16054,The healthcare system is forced to be service oriented by our lifestyle choices.
16055,I’m 60 and still trying to avoid premature illnesses.
16056,"Right now I’m glad I got healthier, more than my younger days."
16057,The healthcare system is stretched today.
16058,Same in south florida.
16059,"Always a bunch of smokers standing around outside the ""restaurants""."
16060,They had to stop letting them smoke indoors to fool the covid into thinking they weren't a bar anymore and meet health standards for restaurants.
16061,Consider the possibilities.
16062,"It is either less widespread than known, which means we know about more cases than there are, exactly as widespread as known, which means we've caught every case, or more widespread than known, which is really the only possible option."
16063,That is the exact opposite of what I said.
16064,It's better to vaccinate more people as early as possible by delaying the second dose.
16065,"The mathematics for this is a bit sophisticated, well beyond your capabilities imho."
16066,"Instead, seek out a mathematician instead of spouting nonsense on the internet."
16067,"Note: you will need to phrase the question correctly, which is likely also beyond your capabilities."
16068,I suspect the wealthy people will to pay for the vaccine also usually fall into the high risk groups.
16069,Rich old people
16070,"If we did notice that the UK strain was becoming more widespread in the US (which is probably inevitable if it is indeed significantly more infectious), is there anything we would or could do differently?"
16071,"It seems to me that the best defense against this is to get the vaccines out as quickly as possible, which we should be doing anyway."
16072,More insidious was the raising the price of the epipen.
16073,"Raised over 500%, cost was $600 for a two pack."

16079,"OWS funded the moderna vaccine, Germany funded the Biontech/Pfizer vaccine."
16080,Well the virus should have been called boomer-doomer.
16081,Then the response in most western countries would have been easier to understand.
16082,I am 65 y.o.
16083,and predicted  in March 2020  that I would have to stay isolated until the vaccine is available.
16084,&gt; Probably because the US has \~65x the amount of people.
16085,What has that to do with anything?
16086,Israel is a small country and they did not really great.
16087,"The US is even doing worse than the EU, which has a complex supranational government system and 440m people."
16088,&gt; I've said for half a year now that per-capita comparisons are only useful if populations are within 1 order of magnitude.
16089,"Ah yes, the good old American defence ""we can't have good health care / a sane voting system / maternity leave / a pandemic response / nice thing X / etc."
16090,"because the country is big""."
16091,Moderna is also a much smaller operation and likely not as efficient as a larger company in research and development and supply.
16092,"They are also largely based in MA with some manufacturing happening there, as well,."
16093,NH is another Moderna manufacturing site.
16094,This is significant because the cost of labor is a bit higher in these states.
16095,"Both companies also have a contingent in Michigan, but it seems like Pfizer has a bit more."
16096,"Moderna had logistical slowdowns, as well, simply because they had not done anything on this scale before."
16097,Figuring these logistics out does actually cost money as well....
16098,You’re gonna get downvoted &amp; shamed too wait for it
16099,I totally agree and that is why the US could never have emulated NZ.
16100,It isn't the Island issue or population density.
16101,Vietnam proves that doesn't prevent elimination from working.
16102,It's that the US people would never trust the authorities enough to comply.
16103,In another pandemic it would play out the same way.
16104,"&gt; why do they need SO MUCH when people are dying

Specifically for drug manufacturers (aside from greed) its the cost to develop *all the other drugs*."
16105,There is millions and millions of dollars invested in drug manufacturing before it even begins to be considered for testing/approval.
16106,Part of the reason for higher prices in more common drugs is to subsidize costs for low-use drugs and development of new ones.
16107,This isn't to say drug companies aren't greedy as hell (one look at Purdue confirms that) but pricing is quite a bit more complex here than in other industries.
16108,"Great, I'll then either have this one as it has 94.1% *efficacy*  of the Pfizer one as it; also over 90% effective."

16120,This is only because you are aproaching the limit of their discrete resolutions (aka you can’t have a fractional death).
16121,This doesn’t apply when looking at countries that still have thousands of bodies.
16122,That’s why the comparison seems to fall apart at lower percentages but seem perfectly rational at higher.
16123,But unlike an Appalachian town there is more than enough data in even a small country for solid math.

16138,"The hardest thing is that as the numbers climb I feel like I should be doing more , but I can't figure out what more I can do."
16139,There's a distinct upper limit to how much you can stay home.
16140,"You still need food and doctor's appointments, etc."
16141,"And even if you are immune and you’ve had the vaccine and you’re visiting another person who is immune, you should still ... um ... isolate because ... it’s just good, you know ... just stay 6 feet apart and don’t look at each other ... you never know what the other person could have ...

16142,"my city is at a 11.44% positivity rate, and is sending the kids back in a hybrid model come next Monday."
16143,"My kid's a senior this year, and has chosen to keep doing remote learning."
16144,Luckily the school district is ok with that
16145,This is one of the reasons people worry about nationalized healthcare.
16146,Healthcare should be between your doctor and patient (and authorized carers).
16147,People don't want the government deciding these things.
16148,We know that it won't last long until our society allows our healthcare to yet again be driven by the bottom dollar.
16149,"Logically, wouldnt a less lethal strain almost always be advantageous in spreading the virus?"
16150,"The ideal virus would not even cause symptoms that werent required in its spread (cough), because anything beyond that and it leads to people isolating."
16151,Seasonal coronaviruses are respiratory viruses.
16152,As are rhinoviruses.
16153,Neither of those last two to three years.
16154,It would be surprising if this coronavirus immunity lasted 2 to 3 years in mild/asymptomatic patients.
16155,And why exactly should they have lower priority?
16156,This was already posted three days ago
16157,eh it's about 25% asymptomatic actually.
16158,"most people don't have severe symptoms, that's for sure."
16159,Who needs GLaDOS when we have malicious administration?
16160,How do we know it’s unlikely that vaccinated people can transmit the virus?
16161,"Astra Zeneca uses a more traditional route that doesn't require new manufacturing facilities, furthermore they said they will not make any profit on the vaccine during the pandemic."
16162,From what I read the profit margin for Moderna and Pfizer is up to 80%.

16172,Like all of Florida
16173,SARS didn't stick around.
16174,As for the common cold... it stuck around because nobody even tried to stop it.
16175,"What's the context given the ""facts"" here?"
16176,"I presented information, but they're not ""facts"" because someone has written them on in the internet, it's hearsay, is what you're trying to say."
16177,&gt; Unless they got a test they didn’t get covid.
16178,"That sentence isn't factual under any context, it's simply an untrue statement."
16179,Be more specific.
16180,"Oh great, keep the kids on the west side out of school and back in the streets."
16181,Surely coronavirus is more dangerous than gun violence in Chicago’s worse neighborhoods
16182,TIL people won’t die as often if they are in lockdown.
16183,Sounds like lockdown should just be the new norm.
16184,"Seems to be in New Jersey, a prior infection bumps you down the priority list."
16185,true but it;s more than that.
16186,Companies like Dyson forced people back in the offices when they were WFH just fine and there was no need to be there.
16187,A lot of other companies in London still forced people back in when there was no need.
16188,Not enough people wear masks on the London tube from what I've witnessed and it doesn;t help.
16189,"It cannot be that people mixed households alone, it was several factors."
16190,Could also be the new strain.
16191,We really don’t know anything about anything.
16192,The whole process was an unorganized mess that left us in the dark both times.
16193,"the quality and speed of travel is new, to some degree, yes."
16194,"but there were still ""mass gatherings"" during the 1918 pandemic."
16195,We held Woodstock during another pandemic.
16196,"My statement was, seasons make no difference if you have zero cases."
16197,"If there is zero Covid to infect anyone, seasons can't make spread more likely, since there is no patient zero to spread it."
16198,That seems like a pretty indisputable fact.
16199,"America couldn't even do it in one city the population of NZ, let alone in even a single state."
16200,What?!
16201,That is bullshit!
16202,Everyone knows that you have to give money to the richest so that it trickles down to all the people!

16205,"No one fan predict the future, however, things are trending the right way with the vaccines."
16206,It’ll get there.
16207,Try to focus on what you can control and accept without judgement what you can’t.
16208,Right?
16209,"Without falling down a political rabbit hole, what can Biden do about state and local people sitting on the fucking things?"
16210,The UK is an island
16211,Yea.
16212,"There is a disconnect between the data, which says there are a lot of unused vaccines out there and people not being able to get the vaccine."
16213,"I think governments are trying to force the vaccinations up, being widening the pool."
16214,I’m not sure that really addresses the problem.
16215,But I understand why they are doing it.
16216,Moderna basically took no risk with the 1 billion in initial funding.
16217,"Also, Moderna said that they will allow their mRNA intellectual property to be used for free only during the pandemic."
16218,So the since Moderna got 1 billion of people's money the resulting intellectual property should be public domain and benefit the greater society.
16219,"Also, Astra Zeneca said that they will not profit off of the vaccine during the pandemic."
16220,"Me, wife, and 2 kids."
16221,US.
16222,March &amp; November.

16224,My wife was the only one that it hit hard the 2nd time as well.

16258,"My kids district has done an absolutely AMAZING job of offering the option of in person or remote schooling and has done great at both, while actively preparing the in person kids to possibly have to go remote on short notice."
16259,"Their school has had 40-50-ish cases, but none have been kids who were exposed at school*."
16260,(I haven't paid as much attention to the stats from other schools.)
16261,"Towards the end of the semester they were getting close to going full remote, but they never needed to."
16262,They had enough staff on quarantine they were struggling to find subs.
16263,*Could they be lying about this?
16264,"Yes, but the numbers always remained 1 or 2 at a time (3 one week), no snowballing and seemed consistent with it being 1-2 families infected at a time."
16265,The adjacent district has bungled things throughout.
16266,"The parents are all pissed, the kids have had no stability, the teachers are absolutely fried from trying to make it work, the kids usually don't show up when remote and aren't doing any work."
16267,"They planned to be in person on an A/B schedule, two weeks before the start of the year they switched to being remote with 2 options, district teachers over MS Teams or an online program run by a 3rd party company."
16268,"In October they started bringing kids to in person on the A/B schedule, starting with the youngest grades."
16269,By mid-November less than a week after the 5-6th graders started in person they went back to full remote.
16270,Through the end of the semester.
16271,"Now they're still deciding what to do for the spring semester and are leaning heavily towards all kids being in person, except those already on the 3rd party program, but no more can do that, because they're out of licenses."
16272,They're saying they don't have any teachers available to teach kids online anymore.
16273,The comparable risk is the risk of catching it multiplied by the risk of it being severe (more severe than a severe reaction from the vaccine).
16274,In healthy young people it’s a numbers game and 1/100k is pretty high when you consider we may want to vaccinate a couple of billion such people.
16275,"Luckily they’ll know far more before they even have a chance of taking it, since a billion people may have been vaccinated before them."
16276,They may have a choice of vaccine to pick a lower risk for their age group for example.

16314,The UK.
16315,Well the UK is a joke....
16316,"he couldn't care less, our benefits have been cut and the country is a mess."
16317,We didn't received stimulus checks like in US
16318,&gt; It doesn’t say how lower it will still accept.

16320,"The main boundary holding back approval of the Oxford vaccine is the quality of the evidence provided, not the reported efficacy, which is still well above the baseline."

16322,"I understand that reinfection is a controversial topic, but I personally know someone that was reinfected."
16323,We don't.
16324,Pure chance dictates that the UK would find it first by virtue of testing the most.
16325,"Which is why the term ""UK variant"" is dumb."
16326,I doubt they'll received bonuses for it
16327,you also don't have access to the others' raw data so....

16345,I’m not upset that an 80 and 89 year old were offered the vaccine.
16346,They *should* be offered the vaccine.
16347,"All 80+ year olds should be, and we shouldn’t waste time talking about their economic status."
16348,Err on the side of more vaccines in arms.

16372,Good.

16374,"And people are hesitant to go to hospital, during the pandemic."
16375,"Data suggests hospitals are the main bottlenecks, sitting with loads of vaccines in their freezers."
16376,It's more like supply exceeds ability to distribute.
16377,The demand is there for sure.
16378,"The demand and willingness to test people on a near constant basis in NYC is probably second to none, but for this, there's no getting it together?"
16379,Setting up these centers won't change the fact that it seems like NYC vaccination centers are being too cautious about what group people are in.
16380,And I know there are reasons for that.
16381,"The FDA set up guidelines, but the states have the ability to enforce and New York (like my state of NJ) will likely enforce even when just jabbing people was the better option."
16382,I feel like the best course of action is to window the distribution.
16383,"So for January, let's say,  you give hospitals enough to vaccinate their staff."
16384,"If they don't use all of it within a certain frame of time, then leftover doses move to the centers."

16387,"It's at least worth trying, so that people just line up wherever there's vaccine."

16389,"Basically, they should be opening it up until you have lines while keeping the 2nd shots in reserve."

16407,*
16408,Gates has donated well over a Billion dollars to fight Covid and aid in vaccine research.
16409,Your right though; that doesn't hurt his wallet.
16410,Where did they mention lockdowns in their comment?
16411,Vaccine distribution is going very slowly.
16412,Most countries have received no vaccines at all so far and most of those who have haven’t even vaccinated 3% of their populations yet.
16413,"What I need to know is, does the variation affect the virulence?"
16414,"I mean, the common cold is also very transmissible, but it's not likely to send people to the hospital."
16415,Most genetic mutations in microorganisms aren't necessarily useful to the microorganism.
16416,"Antibiotic resistance in bacteria only gives bacteria a competitive edge among other microorganisms when antibiotics are present, for example."
16417,"In most other cases, normal bacteria vastly outnumber, and usually crowd out, the resistant ones."
16418,"It seems likely that vaccines will provide sterilizing immunity, there is no current evidence otherwise."
16419,"Haha,you silly."
16420,"By your third point, you do realize people are dying from non covid issues because the hospitals are taking care of covid patients."
16421,Getting vaccinated won't save you from something else happening to you and you couldn't/won't get the care needed to save your life.
16422,There are more ICU beds than staff to use them all over the US...not just here.
16423,Vietnam posted nearly 3% growth this year.
16424,Tourism 6% of GDP.
16425,Way too much would'a should'a could'a.
16426,This is an opinion piece based on generic information.
16427,This is frightening to read.
16428,"Offit says if you're allergic, take the shot and wait in the office for 30 min."
16429,"Who here will sit in the office, in a closed space, with a random person, untested, unknown, for more than a minutes?"
16430,He is recommending to others around the waiting newly vaxed person to take a risk with their lives.
16431,This shallow throw away language is present throughout this piece.
16432,It's possible the writer misquoted or qouted out of context.
16433,"Too many deaths until then, this is tragic."
16434,the argument for requiring people to get vaccinated is to protect those who have the underlying health conditions that make it impossible for them to
16435,He is burning the country to the ground......because one political party is letting him.
16436,They had the power to stop him and refused to over and over and over.
16437,"I agree, there will be a very low number of people willing to pay that amount when considering we have 300 million people."
16438,"I rather have a couple thousand people pay 10k to fund a faster rollout, bonus for vaccine givers, etc."
16439,However currently the money is simply going to the back pockets of the corrupted administrators!
16440,Those people needs to be arrested
16441,[removed]
16442,"And you'd think that all the ""freedumb"" fighers here in the U.S. would understand that, given how much they love to fetishize the sacrifices of our military and to intone that ""freedom isn't free""."
16443,"Alas, no."
16444,That was just more performative B.S.
16445,from them.
16446,I wish I could be proud of my country again.
16447,I didn't know how much I'd miss it.
16448,"To be honest, after healthcare workers are vaccinated, all these dumb fucking rules need to be thrown out and vaccinations need to be **100% age-based**."
16449,"It will be 1000% simpler, it will maximize benefit (since age is the #1 risk of severe covid), and it will be so easy to verify eligibility."
16450,It will also make it super easy to uncover corruption.
16451,With how slow this rollout is going we *have* to remove these ridiculous constraints and get needles in arms ASAP.
16452,I give his mental gymnastics routine a perfect 10.
16453,Incredible technique.
16454,"I don't mind this near as much, at least they are support personnel for the frontline workers."
16455,Same thing happened at one our local hospitals.
16456,Administrators got vaccinated before my daughter who is a registered nurse.
16457,"Peace and love right back to you, and I don't mean to invalidate your fears, I totally understand them."
16458,"I have a grown daughter who is immune compromised, and have been begging her to be careful."
16459,"It's the people who won't mask up or socially distance who are scaring me, and it doesn't sound like you are one of that bunch."
16460,LOL.
16461,"At least no one has tried to spit on me in the last few months, so there's that."
16462,"Stay safe, and I hope you get your vaccine soon."
16463,"There is some evidence that the vaccines provide sterilizing immunity, but it's not conclusive."
16464,I'd quote their data; if I could find it 😉
16465,"The GOP keeps inadvertently boosting what they think is Communism, but it's just basic centrist policy."
16466,"Basic aid from the government during times of crisis, decisions based on health and general welfare."
16467,"Sign me up, Comrade!"
16468,Lots of nursing positions were lost due to covid.
16469,"Unless you specialized in emergency or ICU etc, many hospitals had to let staff go."
16470,Purchasing Power Parity per capita does.
16471,You have to take into account currency differences which manipulates cost of living
16472,my boyfriends roommate tested positive so now my boyfriend is in quarantine.
16473,he's getting tested today and again in 5 days.
16474,i'm so upset honestly i really hope he doesn't get it.
16475,"his roommate said he only fel ""cold like symptoms"" for one day and feels completely fine now."
16476,i hate this virus it doesn't make sense.
16477,"how did he only have symptoms for one day, or was it allergies and he's just asymptomatically carrying the virus?"
16478,The government got out right after the last of the politicians in D.C got their vaccination administered.
16479,After that they could give a shit about the rest of us.
16480,"Fact, they have proved it time after time that we only matter when our votes are needed."
16481,There is no such things as racial differences during election time.
16482,There is only our votes.
16483,Its after the election is when they(politicians) prove this to be true.
16484,By the simple fact is that they lied to all of us with their promises.
16485,What I am trying to say is that they(politicians) shit all over all of us.
16486,Regardless of the color of our skin.
16487,They shit on all of us after the elections are over.
16488,As far as they're concerned.
16489,Their the only ones that matter.
16490,"Their mind set is there is us(politicians).Then there is them(us, you &amp; me)."
16491,That's where the divide in this nation is.
16492,It's with them divding themselves from us.
16493,Hopefully one day all American voters will see through their disguise &amp; common sense when voting instead of emotions.
16494,"EVERYONE PLEASE STAY SAFE &amp; HEALTHY
LOOK  OUT FOR ONE ANOTHER &amp; HELP OUT WHEN ABLE"
16495,"You can expand the list of those eligible for the vaccine all you want, but if there isn’t any supply all you’re doing is frustrating more people."
16496,Did they really make me click the article just to know the city?
16497,"[Here is the preprint the New York Times article is about that contains the prediction: ""In the absence of substantial vaccine roll-out*, cases, hospitalisations, ICU admissions and deaths in 2021 may exceed those in 2020""](https://cmmid.github.io/topics/covid19/reports/uk-novel-variant/2020_12_23_Transmissibility_and_severity_of_VOC_202012_01_in_England.pdf)."
16498,"If you have a rebuttal to the data and predictions contained therein, it would be helpful if you provided specific areas where you think it's wrong."
16499,"(by the way, they define ""substantial vaccine rollout) as 2 million per week."
16500,The UK is currently vaccinating just over 200K per week. )
16501,[removed]
16502,You should be more specific so one don't assume what you're trying to say.
16503,"The girl who lost her taste/smell last summer has had a positive test result today, along with another housemate."
16504,Other 2 are pending.
16505,"They all got ill last summer after the girl lost her taste/smell, and the question is did they all have it last summer, or just the girl."
16506,"Not, ""they didn't get covid unless they got a test""."
16507,&gt;But that is not the point of vaccines.
16508,"The point of a vaccine is to eradicate a disease, not keep it manageable."
16509,"Um, have you heard of the flu vaccine?"
16510,"The point of that vaccine is *definitely not* to eradicate it, as it mutates faster than we can make new vaccines - it's to allow people who are high risk to lower their chances of getting the flu, and to overall reduce the burden on our healthcare systems."
16511,It will end up being the same idea with COVID.
16512,"Don't get me wrong, I think everyone who can physically get a COVID vaccine should do so (personal rights be damned), but I don't think anyone in the medical community expects that COVID will ever be totally eradicated at this point."
16513,Maybe other countries should have thought about implementing that considering there's a pandemic.
16514,Paul Offit has been in medical science before you were swimming in your dad's nutsack.
16515,"He helped create a vaccine for rotavirus, one of the most dangerous viruses on the planet, in fucking college."
16516,He's an influential voice in the pro-vaccine movement.
16517,He has over 130 articles on the immune system and vaccines to his name.
16518,"He has served on the boards of Every Child By Two, Autism Science Foundation, and the CDC."
16519,He was the long-time director of the Division of Infectious Diseases from 1992 to 2014.
16520,He is the professor of vaccine studies at Maurice R. Hilleman and professor of pediatrics at the University of Pennsylvania.
16521,"But no, you're more qualified to make a judgment on when the pandemic will end."
16522,Why should this be a factor for who gets it first
16523,"Well, if that’s your intention, I apologize."
16524,"There are a lot of fishy pro-China accounts on Reddit, so my bad for mistaking you for one."
16525,"I have read it’s expected by the end of spring, though I think we will have significant data before then given the amount of spread."
16526,China is Sus.
16527,"Thanks for the cheering up, but I have learned that Reddit comments often make no sense."
16528,I stand by my agreement with you.
16529,110% This time.
16530,Maybe I'll get twice as many downvotes.
16531,America first.
16532,Americans first.
16533,We're in the fog of war and we're still clinging to linguistic patterns that reinforce a prejudices that make us disregard the available evidence.
16534,"When someone says there's ""no data"" or ""no evidence"" what it means is that there isn't hard proof, but they are advocating a policy decision that favors their arbitrarily made up ""null hypothesis"" by making a leap by saying there is no evidence."
16535,But this is usually not true and in this particular case it is definitely not true.
16536,We should stop pretending that \*all\* epistemology discovery in science follows a particular high-school math pattern of RCT + OR + p value.
16537,"That's not science, that's a way to fairly definitively prove something if you're more justified being skeptical than not."
16538,There IS evidence that supports delayed vaccines and reduced dose vaccines; it's just not great evidence.
16539,The evidence comes from inference from disease/vaccination/immunity models that scientists have built up over decades of experience from human and animal models.
16540,Experts have a pretty good idea for the 3 vaccines that we have that a delayed 2nd dose or a 1/2 dose will be &gt; 50% efficacious than rigidly following the dosing schedule.
16541,"Hard proof either way is not there, and won't be there until it is too late."
16542,So what do we do in the interim?
16543,"In the fog of war, the intuition and guesses of the best scientists in this area should be the ""Null Hypothesis""."
16544,So is it more accurate to say there is NO evidence that depriving 1/2 your potentially vaccinatable population for the next few months when these diseases peak just so the lucky other 1/2 can get a double dose?
16545,I say yes.
16546,It all comes into how the question is framed.

16585,"Facebook makes people think they are important to their ""friends"" when in real life it's normal that people come and go."
16586,"While your opinion about this is very strong, that doesn’t make it real."
16587,[Here ](https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CID/DCDC/Pages/COVID-19/Safe-Schools-for-All-Plan-Science.aspx) is the scientific reasoning founded in data that promotes a school’s ability to open safety.
16588,You can fight with the results all you want but I’m not going to waste my energy.
16589,"Additionally, although covid appears to be the only risk many are concerned with when it comes to the conversation surrounding schools, the social, emotional, mental, and academic damage being caused by schools closing (for nearly a year now) are huge."
16590,[Here](https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CID/DCDC/Pages/COVID-19/Safe-Schools-for-All-Plan-Rationale.aspx) is a summary of data on that.
16591,"The argument is not about whether there is a health risk to opening, it’s about weighing all the level of risks against each other."
16592,Closing schools comes at a huge cost to young children and they’ve already been enduring that burden for nearly a year (which developmentally is significantly more impactful on their rapidly growing brains than a mature adult brain).
16593,"Side note: I’m arguing on behalf of younger children, preschool-3rd."
16594,"Development wise, in-person pre-K through 3rd (with the option of distant learning) should be considered as essential as keeping grocery stores open."
16595,I’m much more comfortable with keeping older children online until community numbers are lower.
16596,Because the entire article quotes a study that specifically centers on the UK.
16597,"I didn't say it wouldn't happen elsewhere, just that the study authors are specifically referring to the UK ant not making predictions about other countries."
16598,Sorta like how lockdowns work except when they don’t
16599,"&gt; was kinda sketchy

that's just like, your opinion, man."
16600,It could be.
16601,Some politicians are advocating for retroactive 2k monthly checks rather than a one-time 2k check.
16602,Everything is still speculative at this point.
16603,"No... Yeah, the number is correct but we were seeing over 30k infections per day just 3 weeks ago."
16604,"Yes, the death rate has gone up but that's the natural delay between infection, admitted to hospital and getting dead."
16605,Our current infection rate is down.

Bullshit."
16617,Natural immunity and vaccine induced immunity are the same thing.
16618,Your body creates the same immunity from either having the disease or getting the vaccine.
16619,Did I say we shouldn’t take it seriously now?

16642,"At some of our local hospitals in MA, they’re creating on-call lists of people who want to be vaccinated but aren’t scheduled for it yet because of missed appointments or people simply not taking the doses scheduled for them."
16643,Literally put it in anyone’s arm who will take it!
16644,Let’s get out of this!
16645,Awww
16646,There’s way more focus on teachers safety than the tens of thousands of grocery store workers with way more contact that have been working this whole time.
16647,"They are paid significantly less and no one cares about them at all and getting them help

It shouldn’t be a competition but if we are going to constantly scream about nurses and teachers we need to be talking about other essential workers."
16648,Ignoring them because they are a poor class is so depresisng
16649,"&gt; and Novavax (middle of the year)

Has the EU actually ordered anything from them yet?"
16650,"The only news I can find is from mid-Decemeber that they're [""closing in on deal""](https://www.politico.eu/article/commission-closing-in-on-deal-for-up-to-200m-doses-of-novavax-coronavirus-vaccine/), but that didn't sound quite final."
16651,"&gt; If either J&amp;J or both of the others get approved, we'll almost get there."
16652,I'm hopeful that April will be the month where things really ramp.
16653,"Maybe AstraZeneca, J&amp;J, CureVac all approved, Moderna finally shipping more, the new BioNTech production-site in German finally up and running at full production..."
16654,"We underestimated how stupid people are,
People don't understand the exponential functions."
16655,"Einstein once said those who understands compounding earns it, those who don't understand compunding pays it."
16656,Every virus or infectious disease won't be cured by an mRNA vaccine but we'll be better prepared for sure.
16657,"not sure why being fined does anything, but I could see how this could lead to someone losing their license or ability to be a nurse."
16658,"I understand why she was likely in shock, but in this case, her action could have possibly saved lives."
16659,Her position is one of many that you simply can't have breakdowns like this where you freeze up.
16660,"I feel terrible for her and everyone involved, but I can also see why a nurse who freezes up in times of crisis needs to be replaced with someone who wont."

16665,*
16666,I'm sure.
16667,UV intensity and sunlight intensity in general go down in winter.
16668,The days are also shorter.
16669,Viral particles also degrade faster in higher temperatures.
16670,"The article focuses on humidity though, a factor which probably works *against* transmission in the winter since breath condensation will fall to the ground faster than in a warmer and dryer environment."
16671,You can test positive for 3 or so months after first getting sick.
16672,"I know someone who several months later, is completely fine physically but still testing positive."
16673,"If they tested positive, then tested negative, then tested positive again... that would mean they likely got re-infected but there's been no real evidence of that yet."
16674,I think it's more likely the virus just never left their bodies completely and re-attacked.
16675,"This is why I'm weary of all the ""re-infections can happen"" headlines because they never actually show that people ever tested negative in between infections."
16676,There needs to be more data on whether the virus was just still in the body or re-infections.
16677,Short lockdown and they have life almost completely normal except for arriving to the country.
16678,"I think they still wear masks on public transport, that’s it."
16679,"Secret was go hard and early, before the virus takes hold..."
16680,"Norway did as well, and they had almost perfectly middle of the road results in terms of Covid deaths per capita, ranking 110 out of 220 countries on worldometer."
16681,They also had relatively light restrictions.
16682,Some of the vaccines have a higher success at preventing severe symptoms then they do at complete immunity.
16683,Getting mild symptoms is a lot better than going to intensive care.
16684,But it does mean you could still infect people after being vaccinated.
16685,I'm a college student in an extremely cold state.
16686,I already lost over a year of time here.
16687,I will be unbelievably mad if there are restrictions next winter because winter is the main season for college here and there is absolutely nothing you can do during Covid Winter :(.
16688,I don't want to lose my last year.
16689,My mental health is so bad and hearing this makes me so angry and sad.
16690,How likely is this?
16691,?
16692,[deleted]
16693,What about Japan as a comparison?
16694,Yeah right
16695,"I imagine these sad reporters following him through a parking lot and he drops a crumb of his bagel and the reporters all dive for it and the one who gets it holds it up in the air and says ""YOU!"
16696,"I WILL MAKE YOU INTO THE BIGGEST LOAF OF BREAD EVER!"""
16697,Oh forgive me for wanting to be outraged over conversion therapy and people not being able to afford insulin.
16698,"You are telling about strawman while calling me ""disgusting"" without explaining why."
16699,It's hardly a strawman if I'm just asking why.
16700,Why do you think I'm disgusting?
16701,With businessmen it's usually the gay thing but you haven't expanded yet.
16702,What makes me disgusting to you?
16703,&gt;You just want to be outraged.
16704,"Says the one going ""shut up"" and calling minorities ""disgusting""."
16705,Did you not get enough of your white wake up powder this morning?
16706,"Also me saying slaves built this nation and not businessmen is not a ""strawman"" to an idiot saying ""businessmen built this country"" it's presenting counter evidence."
16707,You really need to learn what that word means before using it.
16708,Good bot
16709,&gt;Are you boycotting US products too?
16710,"They engage in similar things

Wtf are you talking about lol."
16711,"U.S Prison labor is almost always voluntary unless it's something like community service which is simple, in China you're FORCED to do it."
16712,"Most of our prisoners committed crimes against other people, in China your ideology, even without action, gets you imprisoned."
16713,Concentration camps for kids?
16714,You mean juvenile detention centers?
16715,"You go there by fighting, stealing, dealing drugs etc."
16716,Being a danger to other kids.
16717,And we cant legally torture you or harvest your organs like they do to their prisoners in China.
16718,"No cruel or unusual punishment, that's a our human right."
16719,"Mass surveillance is generally used to stop criminals in the U.S, in China it's used for social credit scores, to target people with the wrong ideology, suppress citizen journalism, arrest government critics etc."
16720,"Law enforcement, the U.S prison system, etc."
16721,"Is all being worked on towards being reformed whereas in China their government is gaining more power, their laws becoming more crippling."
16722,It's ironic because America criticises China for the very things which America's government so often does.
16723,That's why it's ironic.
16724,"Yes, I am spelling it out for you."
16725,Perhaps we should keep to the masks and distancing.
16726,For the first time in years no one in my family has brought any illness home from school.
16727,The school has a policy of sending sick kids home but parents refuse to answer calls from the school.
16728,I cringe when I have to go the school and watch the number of kids walking around with snot dripping down their faces and hacking their guts up.
16729,The number of parents who consider school to be nothing more than a babysitting service is disgusting.
16730,that was not in winter and school was not in session.
16731,there are many differences between then and now.
16732,There is a huge increase in starvation in poorer countries as a result of the global economic crises caused by covid-related closures.
16733,"It seems like a real possibility that when all is said and done, there will be more excess deaths from starvation during this crisis than deaths from covid."
16734,"No, he's talking about my brother."
16735,"I would not call Dan a 'strong leader', he's been pretty invisible both before and during the pandemic."
16736,I have no particular like for the guy but I still think it's still a waste of money having him step down in order to  just deflect some bad PR.
16737,It's looking like these restrictions will last forever :(
16738,What about a starfish mask like mermaid man?
16739,NGL this was too boring to read have a good day
16740,The funny part is on you I reposted it from NBC news same article you you allowed it.🤣🤣.
16741,So I wonder who has the real bias here?
16742,I have a family member that is a home health nurse and has to go into homes with covid positive patients.
16743,According to their boss they are in tier 2 here in California.
16744,I question if that’s accurate since I haven’t seen an official source saying that home health nurses aren’t included with other healthcare workers in tier one but regardless of if they have correct information there isn’t anywhere they can go to get the shot.
16745,I'm saying that a price of 15 euros is more than reasonable for a ticket out of quarantine.
16746,"Heck, I'd even happily pay hundreds."
16747,I mean it’s much much more likely that someone that claims they have had it twice is misled.
16748,"Eitherthey didn’t accurately get tested or they are doing that thing where they claim they have it without a positive test

Really, valid reinfections rates are absurdly rare and it’s fair to be skeptical"
16749,I would say that less dense or populated countries are probably able to manage it even with a high death to population ratio than If a more populous place because supplies are running out here in CA because of how many sick people there are
16750,"Latvia, Croatia, Norway (which had pretty light mandates by global comparison), Slovenia, and Taiwan (which didn’t lock down) all had below average deaths this year."
16751,"It isn’t super rare, nor was New Zealand the best at this."
16752,Croatia had the widest margin.
16753,"At level 3 &amp; 4, we were allowed funerals up to 10 people."
16754,"At level 2, we were allowed 50 people."
16755,"There were some reported cases of people bringing in larger groups,  but we got lucky that the majority followed the rules."
16756,"And if you want to have some more fun about my country, there are an unkown number of cases where the vaccine was given... wrong."
16757,"As in not the proper protocol (wrong needles, subcutaneous instead of muscular, etc) because the instructions from the health ministry were different from the Pfizer ones."
16758,Why ?
16759,No one knows.
16760,"(there is no certainty about the effectiveness or lack thereof of the vaccine administered wrong, so we can still hope for the best."
16761,"Anyway with just 5k people vaccinated overrall, there's basically no harm done."
16762,"It's just more stupid, incompetent stuff.)"
16763,The top 0.1% probably have better medical tech than the vaccine.
16764,Strawman AGAIN!
16765,what does you being gay have anything to do with this?
16766,"secondly of course slavery existed, just because it was a thing doesn't mean it is acceptable."
16767,"""is it because I'm gay?"""
16768,shut up... your narrative is clear.
16769,You have no intention of thinking logically or understanding anything reasonably.
16770,You just want to be outraged.
16771,The UK has the [COVID-19 Genomics UK (COG-UK) consortium](https://www.cogconsortium.uk/) and has performed over 50% of all sequences to date.
16772,"This means the UK is often the first to detect a strain, not necessarily the origin of that strain."
16773,"The US has no similar program in place, with most sequencings taking place in private labs (if at all)."
16774,"We have no idea how prevalent this may be in the US, or even the possibility that the mutations began in the US (or elsewhere) before being discovered in the UK."
16775,I had it back in March so either I'm gonna get it again the next time I leave the house or I can roll around in a pool of covid right now with no fear.
16776,"Welp, as someone with a serious number of allergies and a few serious allergic reactions under my belt, I still think I will get one of the vaccines."
16777,I hope to do it at a hospital just in case.
16778,I don’t like my odds against Covid.
16779,I’m probably lower on the list of recipients so it will likely be 6 months before I can get it anyway.
16780,"This has already been posted [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/kr6419/china_blocks_who_investigators_access_to_wuhan/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3) and [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/kr3lq2/who_disappointed_at_chinese_delays_letting/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3)

16783,we're already living in 15 million merits Black Mirror style
16784,"Hoping someone in the field can explain this, but does it matter?"
16785,Does us actually knowing if we have the UK or South African strain change our strategy or current plans at all?
16786,"I would assume that unless it came out that one of the strains won't be stopped with the vaccine its largely irrelevant to strategy/operations, especially here."
16787,I clarified what I meant by that statement because you missed it but you’re taking it and putting it in your own context.
16788,It seems you have no interest in a sophisticated discussion so I’m ending this here and not replying further.
16789,Thanks.
16790,"Nobody said ""random chance,"" I said you can't just assume causality."
16791,"If both flu and covid spread internationally, why has flu been reduced everywhere by ""countries that are doing well with COVID reduction measures,"" while COVID remains strong in those countries that saw the flu disappear?"
16792,"Wait wait, youre offering me the vaccines here for 15 bucks?"
16793,Id pay tenfolds if i got it right now.
16794,&gt;one person can spread it to 8.
16795,There's that misleading r0 number which is a lot lower than 8.
16796,"The press has been downplaying ""super-spreaders"" perhaps they should reverse that policy..."
16797,Sounds like they have a lawsuit on their hands.
16798,The Spanish Flu traveled so well because of major troop mobilization during WWI.
16799,"That was a very odd circumstance back then, whereas rapid international travel is commonplace now."
16800,"And it seems like smallpox hitched a ride on hogs the Spanish brought over and let loose in/around Florida, which is why it got so far ahead of the Europeans."
16801,"The US will have at least competent leadership at the federal level, but many at the state and local levels will dig in and ignore it even harder."

16803,they don't just want to rally against their best interests.
16804,They want to throw YOU under the tires as they do it.
16805,Vietnam's health system isn't that good and it's quite a densely populated country.
16806,Large-scale transmission would be an absolute disaster.
16807,Their only option is to act quickly and aggressively and stamp out local transmission ASAP.
16808,"Well of course they'll rather you come forward, but couple years back when P2P (peer-to-peer) loans tanked, and people wanted to protest in Beijing, ALL the participants were arrested en route."
16809,"Buses, trains, taxi, even your own cars.."
16810,"If China wants to find someone, they can, and they will."
16811,"They can fine you if you smoked in your own car, via facial recognition at traffic lights."
16812,"China is THE big brother country, and they're REALLY good at it."
16813,"I was experiencing intermittent chest pain, dizzyness, racing heart for 9 months after getting sick in january."
16814,Confusingly i think its liver failure causing the heart problems.
16815,I started taking iron and vitamin b supplements and suddenly everythings getting better.
16816,"Covid definitely attacks the liver and kidneys, i still have pale stool ever since being sick (a sign liver isnt producing bile) 

Without bile you dont really digest well, especially fat soluble vitamins like vitamin d. I had to actually stop taking vitamin d cuz it was making my stomach hurt."
16817,"But i digress, just throwing this out there, i found my treatment (iron and b vitamins) and ive not had heart problems or sudden sleep awakenings since."
16818,I guess some people forget that we don't actually vaccinate against the virus and only the disease it causes.
16819,"Rubeola causes Measels, but we don't vaccinate against rubeola- we vaccinate against Measels."
16820,"Same with polio, mumps, chicken pox - the list goes on."
16821,Fake news is an awful thing!
16822,"&gt; Wearing a mask does not protect you from covid... 

Then why are nurses and doctors in such dire need of masks to protect themselves?"
16823,It rains in BC 24/7 for close to half the year.

16826,It takes a year to actually leave.

16828,I'm sorry to hear that.
16829,I hope she makes it through.
16830,It sounds like you all were acting responsibly.
16831,How did she catch covid though?
16832,Why does the title sounds as though its already gone?
16833,I did bankruptcy in 2020.
16834,My bankruptcy hearing was all the lawyers and claimants for the day all on a giant conference call taking their turns.
16835,"ah yes

another "" freezer failure """
16836,"I suggest joining r/asthma I’ve heard mixed things on there but I believe the CDC said some time ago that people with underlying health conditions are good to be vaccinated, just not sure in what round."
16837,I’m sorry.
16838,It shouldn’t have been this way.
16839,"Truly, my heart goes out to you."
16840,Still in a room without a view
16841,After vaccination will a COVID antibody test (IgG) show if the vaccine is working for me?
16842,Originally I thought yes but I am not sure anymore after some research.
16843,Some sources said yes other sources claimed that the test may show negative results even if the vaccine is working as the vaccine induced antibodies are not the same as the IgG after an infection.
16844,Just two more weeks to flatten the curve.
16845,Counterpoint: Vaccines work by creating antibodies.
16846,Identical?
16847,Probably not.
16848,"But both the monoclonal antibody drugs and the vaccines work by primarily targeting the spike protein, which has significantly mutated in the SA strain."
16849,"It doesn't make me a doomer to observe that this is worth paying very, very close attention to."
16850,"Even if the current SA variant isn't resistant to vaccines, evolutionary speaking its existence makes it a lot more likely that further resistance-granting mutations will arise, especially once the virus is exposed to strong selective pressure from the vaccines."
16851,The coordination all over the world is a mess.
16852,Only the UK and Israel have so far done it right.
16853,"You might think the US is a mess but they have vaccinated far, far more people than the average European country."
16854,Denmark has had the vaccinations for 10 days and hasn't given one to a single person.
16855,France - less than 0.01% of its population.
16856,The sirens and the silence i will never forget it.
16857,A properly fitted and seal checked N99 or N100 respirator combined with ventless goggles will absolutely ensure that you do not come into contact with enough airborne pathogens to cause a problem.
16858,"Of course, that is if you are disciplined enough to never touch or adjust your mask once you have donned it, and to never take it off for any reason until you are safely back at home, no matter how thirsty, hungry, or restricted you feel, and to never put it back on once you have taken it off the first time...

OK yeah, most people are probably fooked."

16866,Gl with that.
16867,China isn't a weakling like the other countries that get bullied.
16868,Anyone looked at how a single dose strategy is going to impact the rollout in ~12 weeks when those other vaccines are approved?
16869,"If we lock a whole bunch of people into Moderna and Pfizer, we aren't going to be able to make as much use of other vaccines as they start coming online."
16870,"Sounds like you are doing it right, and here's hoping for that vaccine as soon as possible."

16872,My wife got kicked out of a facebook group because she let our toddler cry because he had to go to bed.
16873,"I got threatened because my motorcycle was too loud for a neighbours liking, which it was but a threat is different if the person knows where you live and where you park your stuff."
16874,"I've seen family/neighbour fights because of facebook posts

Nah, gimme random internet strangers instead of facebook."
16875,"Teacher here and I would feel a lot safer in a department store than I would being around 28 germ ridden seven year olds who sneeze into their mask and lick the snot off, have no concept of personal space, and who need my constant help."
16876,"It’s not comparable to department stores, sorry."
16877,"There are a number of U.S. companies I am also personally boycotting, yes."
16878,Hmm... two of my group home staff have tested positive twice months apart.
16879,Both were really sick the second time.
16880,100% agree!
16881,What are you getting at?
16882,"Even if most of them are on the old side, old people dying younger than they otherwise would have can still have a severe impact on things."
16883,"They don't have time to get their affairs in order, set up inheritance, sometimes they leave their spouse in debt as they blow through all their savings trying to survive."
16884,Sometimes they have an entire network of people who depend on them.
16885,Think of all the parents who take it for granted that they're able to leave their kids with grandma and grandpa while they pursue a career.
16886,"Think of all the doctors, lawyers, scientists and judges over 50 who do valuable work, and who take a long time to replace when they die."
16887,"People just think ""oh they're old"" but there's a lot of consequences to an old person dying at 65 instead of 80."
16888,Trying to keep cultures alive is also stupid.
16889,Times change and people need to adapt.
16890,I agree with the sentiment - however that is not really possible in practice.
16891,I can't imagine any western societies refusing medical service to people who chose not to be vaccinated - and unfortunately the rest of society will suffer the burden of the increased strain they will continue to put on the health care services.
16892,"I guess it comes down to need and if you have need and can save a life, there’s that (ends justify means)."
16893,Hawaii wasn't allowed to terminate flights altogether as they're a part of the US.
16894,Their Pacific islands neighbors did shut them down in many cases and have zero COVID now.
16895,"Yea, totally different cultures."
16896,Portuguese (and other Southern European populations) have an insane connection to their families and most familiy would always celebrate christmas like there was no pandemic.
16897,"Although, I do think we ahd way less emmigrants than in other years so it wasn't all normal."

16905,Preferably an easy to learn one.
16906,What I find strange about politicians being an extension of general society is yhat there's no extension of the working class.
16907,"Let me clarify, I’m in the UK, and in 6 weeks the new variant has massively increased the rate of spread."
16908,"Once the new variant takes hold in the various other countries, after a lag of 6-8 weeks, cases will rocket."
16909,The US won’t be able to meet oxygen demands and a lot of people will die.

16912,This is why the Federal Government needs to take over vaccine distribution.
16913,We don't need 10+3 standards for vaccine distibution.
16914,The Federal Government has the power to to do so under the POGG clause to do so in an emergency.
16915,But nothing spread at any BLM rally.
16916,"They were covidproof

Good lord, keep your political agenda out"
16917,"They aren't opening NOW... he said that if the vaccine is implemented as planned (100 million by the first 100 days-not sure if that's people or doeses tho) and Congress approves enough money to equip teachers and students with the necessary equipment (PPE, air filtration, and of course vaccinations), why not?"
16918,Again?
16919,We seem to be unable to get people vaccinated the first time around.
16920,"I believe they were late to ordering the Moderna vaccine(and only a small quantity), and are not expecting any deliveries before March."
16921,Therefore it doesn't make sense to approve it already.
16922,First of all it made more sense to for drug authorization agency to use resources looking at vaccines that they were actually able to deploy immediately(the Oxford/AZ one).
16923,"Secondly politically, it would also highlight the UK coming ""late to the party"" on this particular vaccine, which they are obviously not interested in(and is also pointless as explained above)."
16924,They will surely approve it in time for allowing its use as soon as doses can be arriving.
16925,I don't know but they have been pretty well organized throughout.
16926,There is also a lot of public trust in the government and institutions which helps.

16928,"Their mistake was trusting people to self quarantine, the same error Canada made."
16929,NZ makes people quarantine in state run facilities with military and police guard and multiple Covid tests required before release.
16930,We still have had numerous cases of people breaking out of the facilities and needing to be arrested and charged by police.
16931,Trusting people to self quarantine is a recipe for disaster.

16976,Has anyone else had to bring someone into the hospital for Covid?
16977,I've heard that hospitals right now aren't treating them and are just giving them oxygen.
16978,Would it be better if they just stayed home so family can actually help the person?
16979,The argument that a hospital needs to be doing elective procedures to stay in business so they can treat covid is a bit of a stretch.
16980,"If COVID causes  a hospital to go out of business and shut down, reducing COVID caring capacity mid-pandemic, then there would likely be a response from layers of government to support it."
16981,"Or, people should ask for more from their government."

17001,It mimics the virus without causing an infection and spreading.
17002,Adjuvants can cause an enhanced response by the immune system.
17003,Other than that I'm not sure.
17004,"It's true for other vaccines too, and that's why the current recommendation is for everyone to get vaccinated regardless of prior infection."

17024,"Those included districts securing necessary funding to reconfigure classrooms for better social distancing, procuring protective equipment and devising plans to accommodate at-risk teachers and students."
17025,Biden’s comments won praise from the nation’s two major teachers unions.

17070,The rate is usually 0.00001% or sth around that number.
17071,Not 10%.
17072,They largely ruled it out at the time.

17227,Well yes.

17234,Now where did I put my welding torch?
17235,&gt; You have to actually roll out the vaccines first.
17236,"That is what we are doing, and the dispensing rate increases daily!"
17237,"Kind of like the spread of infection did, but on the positive side."
17238,"He blocked 2k checks, he blocked big stimulus bills."
17239,Yeah retail.
17240,In March retail except for food and HD were closed.
17241,There is no need to but clothing/trinkets/browse but people do.
17242,There will always be an amount of time they're sitting in freezers.
17243,"It's taking longer than if they just opened it up to the general public, but then we'd within weeks reach maybe 10% of a random assortment of mostly younger and healthier people who are immunized and go through months of small sporadic vaccine shipments without any real impact on the toll of the disease."
17244,Vaccinating people most at risk first will more quickly reduce hospitalizations and death even if the rate of vaccination is slower.
17245,[removed]
17246,"I know, right!"
17247,People here keep acting like he's be working to fight transmissible diseases for the last 20 years or something.
17248,Filibuster is not a strategy Mitch would promote right now as the virus is something he is scared of as a polio survivor.
17249,Being around infected people means more virus gets in your body from exposure.
17250,I would isolate from the others
17251,I assure you that I cannot possibly be more serious.
17252,These general rules stop the spread of most respiratory diseases.
17253,"I’m not saying ban travel or don’t visit grandma but taking a few extra steps like masking, distancing, and avoiding large crowds from here on will do a lot of good."
17254,If you don’t want to that’s fine but it’s a good idea IMHO.
17255,&gt; ... how could an impurity be worse?
17256,You might be surprised.
17257,Carbon Monoxide.
17258,Look it up.
17259,The president can't help you?
17260,California can.
17261,What are they doing.
17262,The California gov can request additional help from the fed.
17263,But I haven't heard anything about it
17264, Better than most.
17265,I found it surprising that no attempt was made to restrict movements in the US during the breakout though.
17266,It was like it never occurred to anyone that you might be able to slow /stop the virus.
17267,"China managed to largely contain / stop the virus in its tracks by isolating and locking down regions quickly, the US could have done the same."
17268,I think USA is back to normal come summer regardless how many have gotten the vaccine
17269,"Ehh define ""soon""."
17270,"I think the actual case number isn't THAT much higher than reported numbers, though it's certainly quite a bit higher."
17271,I do think artificial herd immunity by this summer with the aid of vaccines is a pretty reasonable hope though.
17272,just report it as being off-topic and let the mods clean it up.
17273,[removed]
17274,"Seriously, tell rich people if you pay to set up a clinic or train a team for vaccinating hop in line first."
17275,Any data on the long term effectiveness of the vaccine?
17276,Please share the peer reviewed study with me.
17277,If not we are idiots for creating a policy based on irrational fear alone.
17278,i wonder why that is...
17279,I'm sensing some sarcasm...
17280,"He didn't say ""into next winter"", or ""next winter we'll add *more*!"""
17281,"What he said was that he expects us to make significant progress in getting rates of infection down to something that is tolerable, and restrictions can be evaporated given winding down of the pandemic."
17282,"Since it appears to be seasonal, yeah it makes sense to keep an eye out and respond quickly so you don't have to go through all this shit again."
17283,IMHO.
17284,I am behind on the TWIV podcasts.
17285,I am wondering what Vincent's take is on this.
17286,I find it really incredible that they are considering delaying the 2nd dose.
17287,Who is living their life in fear?
17288,You don’t know what I do on a day to day basis.

17296,"Scott Gottlieb gave an interview with CNBC back in the first week of November and estimated the actual daily infections was probably 500,000 compared to the 150,000 that were confirmed."
17297,Same multiplier probably holds now.
17298,"You are right... immunity is not black and white, and to add to this, for a more productive conversation we should also define 'immunity'."
17299,100% protection?
17300,"Not even a year (see prison population reinfections, which are so far a fraction of a percent)."
17301,50% protection?
17302,"Well, even in those doomer articles earlier in the year ('people get reinfected with the common cold coronaviruses multiple times, it's the same for SARS-2') the study referenced mentioned that you still got infected significantly less even after 5 years, though it was nowhere near 100%."
17303,I think we are almost guaranteed to see some level of protection even for years.
17304,Only because the population allowed it.
17305,Enjoy lockdowns peeps.
17306,At this stage americans should forget about buying ppe and start stocking up on body bags and caskets instead.
17307,May I ask what you're doing with your life?
17308,"You calling me goofy doesn't affect me one bit because I'm extraordinarily happy with my life - I'm doing the job I've always wanted to do, I'm making a difference to people lives, I'm able to provide anything my wife and children need and I've made incredible friends throughout it all."
17309,"Obviously I doubt you're going to reply now that someone's put you in your place, but you may want to reflect a little on how your life is going and if calling a doctor goofy is just your way of trying to make yourself feel better."
17310,Good luck with everything :)
17311,And you?
17312,Naturally cynical i presume.
17313,"Me too, but just not cynical and paranoid enough to live my life in fear due to an extreme minority of people who get severe effects from covid-19."
17314,"They do have it all in one bag, unfortunately it's a colostomy bag."
17315,Side effect of the rampant Covid.
17316,"Drive through vaccinations is a HORRIBLE idea for a city where the majority of the residents do not own a car, let alone a license."
17317,Does cuomo know ANYTHING about his city at all?
17318,"As someone from NYC, I hope I can walk in and get one of these mass vaccinations."
17319,There's no excuse to create a drive through here.
17320,"Wear a mask, walk in, get your vaccination."
17321,Drive through keeps most of us from receiving a vaccine.
17322,"I didn’t see a list of countries in the article, any idea where that can be found?"
17323,I’m supposed to go to Vietnam from Canada in March as an expert for work.
17324,"From the article - 
'World Health Organisation Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said two members of the investigative team had already left their home countries for Wuhan, as agreed in advance with China, when it became clear that Beijing had not issued the necessary permission for the team to enter the country.'"
17325,Where does it say they were never applied for?
17326,Either way - China agreed for them to enter and then refused entry knowing what they were there for.
17327,That is suspect and you're rude.
17328,Link?
17329,"Month 5, whipped."
17330,"Month 6, no one gets to month 6 because whipped peanut butter is a crime against mankind  so they just send you a congratulatory letter thanking you for your continued support."
17331,And they closed the schools and mess everyone up again in a completely unsustainable response.
17332,At some point in the future no countries will be able to close down.
17333,They will not be able to afford it financially or societally.
17334,This level of risk adversity is not sustainable either and is real short term thinking by governments.
17335,We are fucking the kids over with this.
17336,They deserve better.
17337,Leaders  should be thinking far longer term on this.
17338,Btw I believe locking down is a terrible choice believe it or not.
17339,I mean we don't have much information on both jab's lasting immunity either.
17340,"It was approved without the knowledge of long term immunity, that includes the USA."
17341,Is that irresponsible as there is no data?
17342,It's not a gamble.
17343,"It's a calculated risk, one which authorities in the UK have calculated to be more than worth it."
17344,"Based on our knowledge and current data from the vaccine, the chances of failure are low and the benefit derived from delaying the second jab is massive."
17345,Hotel?
17346,Trivago
17347,Ya 100m is pretty reasonable.
17348,"The death rate is less than 5/1000, and they're closing in on 500k deaths."
17349,"500k deaths is about 100m infections, meaning that once the elderly get vaccinates, the deaths are going to dramatically decrease."
17350,"It'll probably start to become a non issue in like 2 or 3 months, assuming they start doing like a million vaccinations a day."
17351,They're going to be really close to heard immunity assuming that reinfection is significantly less lethal.
17352,"The last major pandemic was in 2009, H1N1 remember?"
17353,What's wrong with opening schools after vaccination is widely available?
17354,[deleted]
17355,&gt; Denmark has had the vaccinations for 10 days and hasn't given one to a single person.
17356,You sure about this?
17357,Last I checked they're 5th or 6th globally in terms of % of population vaccinated.
17358,"Accouring to ourworldindata they're at 0.85%, the best of any European country other than the UK."
17359,What a low life.
17360,And in areas with high rates?
17361,"All medical gas (breathing air, oxygen, nitrous oxide etc) is classified as medical drugs and because it’s manufactered at the hospital it needs to follow the same standard and testing as drugs made at a factory 

In sweden one hospital had to close down one section/floor because of particles caused by the newly welded pipes"
17362,Its either the overseas citizens or the 90 million citizens in the country.
17363,"The new strain is more dangerous to ""clean"" places like Taiwan and Vietnam than it is to places where there is already widespread community transmission of the other strains."
17364,The new strain with 70% higher transmission rate can potentially punch through the existing quarantine measures to start a new chain of transmissions in Vietnam.
17365,"Until the UK has done its job and kept the new strain under control or a new proven quarantine procedures for the new strain has been established globally, Vietnam literally cant afford to bring back the new strains."
17366,"There’s about 22-23,000 deaths from covid for people aged 54 or younger."
17367,Not all ages- that’s not what I was arguing.
17368,"Which is less than driving, but that’s besides the point it was just a comparison."
17369,Maybe the other diseases aren’t as infectious but if they are more deadly for people in that age range.
17370,"As to the last point, you can’t put a number on that?"
17371,"All I’m saying is once the group that this virus is truly deadly to is vaccinated, we should start to open up."
17372,"When the only people left that are not vaccinated have a 99.999% survival rate, it’s ridiculous to keep the world shut down."
17373,"Not to mention shut downs have a lot of effects on people too- mentally, economically, physically."
17374,"That's all good and well, but we don't have much information about the first jab's lasting immunity, and it doesn't look good during the first 10 days after the first jab either."
17375,"In AstraZeneca's case, we don't know anything for sure, since they botched their phase III trial."
17376,"It is the vaccine I would most like to have, but sadly it's the one I trust the least at this point."
17377,"We can use the first jab ... you mean ""we hope we can""."
17378,You are basing your conclusion on the assumptions that are in dispute.
17379,"I hope you're right, but it's a gamble."
17380,"Mmkay I shared my views, don’t have to go all conspiracy here"
17381,India actually surged during summer as well
17382,Ya that first wave was way under counted.
17383,"Back then, Canada had like a 7% death rate while the US had a 2% death rate."
17384,"Basically the Canadians were doing next to no testing compared to the Americans and then they were pointing to the ""disaster south of the border"" because the US had good data on their outbreak."
17385,It was pretty infuriating to see the Canadians basically do nothing other than implement soft border restrictions under the assumption that it was a USA problem which gave them an excuse to ignore the problem here.
17386,"My best guess on per capita infections is that the US had a little less than double the infection rate, but back then everyone in Canada was acting like it wasn't even here."
17387,Maybe my perspective is a bit off because I got infected back then and had to deal with the hospital being unwilling to test me without having been to China and doctors telling me I could take my mask off in the hospital because I wasn't coughing.
17388,The restaurant where my son works had an employee with a positive test.
17389,"I don't know if the owner is allowed to tell anybody or not, but I really don't think I'll ever eat there again."
17390,I didn't see anything on Facebook about her informing customers.
17391,"It's only got 10-12 tables, so the waitress would be walking past literally everybody."
17392,And none of them apparently were told about the exposure.
17393,May have already happened in South Africa
17394,"Opposite way round
You don't want any moisture in aviation oxygen as this may freeze at high altitude where it is very cold"
17395,To clarify my girlfriend is Vietnamese.
17396,"If Trudeau is french, then all Americans are British."
17397,im so sorry and i wish you the best in your recovery.
17398,i wish i knew what else to say.
17399,A year!?!?
17400,Surely the Vietnamese government can’t abandon its own citizens for that long.
17401,A soul for a soul
17402,I think restrictions will loosen up when the UK has finished at least 80% of its vaccination program.
17403,It will be a year at least.
17404,Sorry that you're stuck in the UK.
17405,[deleted]
17406,No shit
17407,Just suspend?
17408,"I'm not antivax, but they should know."
17409,Don't let this discourage you from getting a covid vaccine.
17410,PPE is only effective over a short period of time.
17411,Hence doctors etc catching it.
17412,If a resident doesn’t want to get they wouldn’t be in danger since all staff and nurses would be vaccinated and still wearing PPE.
17413,When you sign up to be a nurse you’re signing up to protect people.
17414,If there was a vaccine or cancer everyone would take it.
17415,Just because the disease is nee doesn’t mean the vaccine should be mandatory to nurses.
17416,"Residents live there, therefore wouldn’t be spreading to each other."
17417,So if there were no nurses ( which would go against the point of a home ) they’d be alone and segregated and not catching the virus.
17418,"&gt;On a per capita basis, Iceland is worse off than New Zealand, Singapore and Hong Kong, despite it being a remote island with low population density."
17419,"&gt;

They still did great lol."
17420,And iceland has a population distribution that is almost unbelievable.
17421,60% of the population on the 1% land area of Reykjavik.
17422,"You'd have to sum up a few of the largest NZ cities to even get near that number


&gt;Land-connected Vietnam with many densely populated cities also managed its situation very well."
17423,"&gt;

Yeah, it seems the virus has a hard time surviving in hot and humid areas."
17424,"That, and a lot of Asian countries are handling the pandemic well, obviously."
17425,That differs from state to state
17426,"It's kind of a misleading headline, restrictions have only been eased for a few days."
17427,"The article said it was the second incident of this type to happen in Egypt
Just horrible"
17428,Why would this article make you think that's a good idea?
17429,[removed]
17430,"You know, OP is actually right."
17431,"You're the most contagious during the pre-symptomatic period, and this applies to other viral illnesses too."
17432,"Also, the vaccine doesn't necessarily grant immunity, it just gives you a far better chance at beating the infection, to the point where you may be asymptomatic."
17433,We don't have the data to show it prevents infection outright.
17434,"Belgium and Ireland inflate their numbers even more than this by including ""suspected covid deaths"" in the absence of even a positive test result."
17435,[removed]
17436,I think you were kind of harsh with this comment but yeah it’s pretty clear that at some point or another a lot of people on this have to mentally overcome the fact that we will be getting back to normal soon.
17437,I know it’s a hard thing to accept for them to accept but like I’d recommend just going outside and seeing what the world is up to considering the world doesn’t give a rats ass atm
17438,Source/Link?
17439,No data means no data.
17440,Not data to support your point or that point.
17441,You don't act in the absence of data.
17442,You err in the side of caution.
17443,"No data that masks work, start the mask, doesn't hurt."
17444,"No data there is surface transmission, you clean."
17445,"No data cavidad work at that dosage, you give the bashir at full dosage."
17446,"They can play around with their Oxford vaccine as there is ""data"" for pretty much any dosage."
17447,"But this one, nah

Also approve moderna, they seem to be less objectionable to this experiment"
17448,Attorney's can't believe in the same pudding-brain things as the pudding-brained?
17449,But asymptomatic people still spread it.
17450,"They aren't ""sick""."
17451,My understanding is that we don't know if the vaccine just makes you asymptomatic and stops you from being deathly ill or if it totally stops you from being a spreader.
17452,Every time a new variant comes out we see at least a few of these nothingburger type articles.
17453,It's unfortunate.
17454,"The mechanisms described here aren't necessarily incorrect, but they are not unique to SARS-CoV-2 or these vaccines."
17455,"This is just a very general description of how viral mutation works, and has nothing to do with the specific mutations we are seeing."
17456,"It is not known for sure how long immunity typically lasts, but for both it is expected to be several years."
17457,"See, e.g., https://www.nytimes.com/2020/11/17/health/coronavirus-immunity.html"
17458,Year too late
17459,But you aren’t wrong.
17460,"Honestly, the article is wrong."
17461,Or at the very least not exactly correct.
17462,"There are definite cases of reinfection, but I think everyone wants this to just be over and are grasping onto anything that could make that happen."
17463,"I am hopeful that more people will be immune longer than a few months, but honestly, I don’t think they know yet."
17464,"I hope you all are recovered or recovering well, I am sure articles like these are extremely frustrating for you because of your experience."
17465,Everyone is just too ready to only agree with their already decided on opinion to actually try to listen to others.
17466,It’s become difficult to have any actual discussion.
17467,Exactly I feel like I just have nothing to do with my life.
17468,"I realize I could be a lot worse off, but my job disappeared because of Covid and just kind of feel like I'm flailing lately."
17469,[deleted]
17470,Trying to preserve languages is an important part of keep a culture alive.
17471,A culture which is almost gone.
17472,"Just from my personal experience, I shunned taking Ojibway lessons and I kind of regret it."
17473,It would’ve been cool to talk with my grandmother the way she talked with hers.
17474,"We should be trying to preserve as many indigenous cultures as we can, otherwise we just end up as one homogenous lump."
17475,Language is an important part of expression.
17476,"25k is still an absolute joke, how about at the very least a million?"
17477,Not according to my high school friend on Facebook who watched a YouTube video

17483,Unpopular opinion: They should have been doing challenge trials as soon as phase one was completed on each vaccine candidate.
17484,I guess US sudden explosion is mainly due to this UK variant.
17485,I remember in mid September India was on course to surpass US within 10 days...But few weeks later things turned drastically.
17486,Now India have half the cases compared to US.
17487,McConnell is very skillful in keeping his party in line.
17488,I can see all that supported 2k stimulus turn around and claim we can't afford it
17489,The hidden cost of Covid slowdowns... because that's about all we've seen in the West
17490,The fact of the matter is that the risk of death in an otherwise healthy person is not extremely high.
17491,"Once the vulnerable are vaccinated and therefore removed from the chain of propagation, death and hospitalization numbers will begin to plummet."
17492,And we're only a few months away from that being measurable.
17493,It's true sadly.
17494,Heartbreaking.
17495,Your mortgage is 4800?
17496,!
17497,Pfizer will conduct clinical trials for children 11-15 in April.
17498,By the summer that age group may be authorized.
17499,It's unlikely that we'll immunize younger children than that until next year.
17500,I can't link to an article because they said this during the EUA committee review.
17501,Why is it good?
17502,Honest answer please.
17503,I missed this in April.
17504,Interesting article.
17505,It's more about why some young people *do* have severe cases.
17506,"Very few, but those are the interesting cases."
17507,"I think Doctors and Health Bureaucrats need to stop making predictions about human behaviour and psychology, they're so completely out of touch."
17508,"He does say in the video that we probably will not have mask mandates next fall/winter, so I'm assuming he's speaking from a behavioural and not restrictions stand point."
17509,Because it’s not common sense at all.
17510,"If 1000 died in my hometown of 2000, it would be insane to say “you can’t say it’s worse than nyc because nyc has so many more people”

We use percentages specifically because they’re how you compare groups of different sizes"
17511,&gt; You realize not everyone who disagrees with you is some alt right antimasker right?
17512,You realize that it's irrelevant if people as a whole behave like morons and aren't even fined for it?
17513,It's not about you.
17514,Never was.
17515,"&gt; Regardless, what harm is there in doing the math?"
17516,"Either you’re right and we don’t do anything, or you’re wrong and lives get saved."
17517,How does either of those hurt your feelings?
17518,"Because it nurtures that shitty ""well let's shaft poor countries to solve it, not like they mattered anyway"" mindset by limiting the problem to a mathematical matter while disregarding the ethical issues of the whole thing."
17519,The issue isn't a purely statistical one.
17520,"&gt; about the same size (per square mile)

I figure that's not uncommon, most places in the world have an area of about one square mile per square mile"
17521,"Questions:

1."

17523,2.
17524,How long does immunity *typically* last in people who have been vaccinated?
17525,3.
17526,"If there is a significant difference between the answers for Q1 and Q2, what is the science behind it?"
17527,"Yeah, this is pathetic..."
17528,Unless they got a test they didn’t get covid.
17529,Thanks because I was so confused lol I thought Florida was doing rather well with vaccine distribution
17530,"It's discriminatory, it won't be possible."

By Hoang Thuy - Viet Tuan
Tue 1/5/2021, 08:18 pm (GMT+7)

The Vietnamese PM has banned flights from countries and territories like the U.K. and South Africa that have recorded mutations of the new coronavirus."
18110,"Prime Minister Nguyen Xuan Phuc said Tuesday that the Ministries of Foreign Affairs, Health and Transport have to coordinate with each other and draw up a list of countries and territories that this new regulation will apply to."
18111,"For now, the list includes U.K. and South Africa, where two different variants of the virus have been found."
18112,The one found in the U.K. early last month is said to be 70 percent more transmissible than the old one.
18113,Britain’s health minister said Monday that the mutation found recently in South Africa is even more problematic.
18114,"PM Phuc issued the order after the health ministry proposed Monday that inbound flights are suspended or limited from countries and territories with the new, more contagious coronavirus strains."
18115,The proposal was submitted after the ministry confirmed Saturday that a 44-year-old Vietnamese woman returning home from Britain and quarantined in the Mekong Delta province of Tra Vinh upon arrival was infected with the new virus strain.

18181,Wasnt the Army in Iraq and Afghanistan to protect its civilians against the Taliban/ISIS or whatever other terrorist groups are wreaking havoc these days.
18182,Thought the whole reason the US army hasnt left these areas was because these groups would come in and terrorize the civilians there if they did?

Healthcare first, elderly, frontline, general population."

18347,My mom became symptomatic with Covid a month ago.
18348,She was pretty severely ill and hospitalized briefly on Dec 24 for myocarditis.
18349,She tested positive for COVID on the 24th.
18350,"She’s out now and was fever free for a week, but today it’s spiked to 102 degrees."
18351,"She really wants me to come see her, but I am immunocompromised."
18352,Is she still contagious?
18353,How could you possibly know that without looking into all the issues.
18354,&gt; they've handled the situation in such an antagonistic and infuriating way that it becomes easy to understand why so many people sincerely think they are hiding something.
18355,The US was openly accusing the Chinese of having created the virus in a lab.
18356,"https://www.cotton.senate.gov/news/press-releases/-cotton-op-ed-in-the-wall-street-journal-and-145coronavirus-and-the-laboratories-in-wuhan-and-146

The US also openly celebrated that covid outbreak in China would create more American jobs."
18357,"https://www.bbc.com/news/business-51276323

The US continued to blame China on multiple occasions in public statements."
18358,"https://www.cnn.com/2020/10/02/asia/trump-china-coronavirus-intl-hnk/index.html

I would imagine that America's actions made China act in an antagonistic and infuriating way."
18359,What do you think?
18360,I don’t.
18361,I’ll look him up
18362,[removed]
18363,Oh please.
18364,Don’t compare the disaster in NYC with the 2018 flu season.
18365,Covid patients tend to be much sicker and require more care for longer than flu patients.
18366,That article describes the tents as being a way to help people with milder flu symptoms who “just need Tamiflu”.
18367,"Also according to the CDC that especially bad flu season resulted in an estimated 810,000 hospitalizations throughout a 6 month period, while there are currently 130,000 people hospitalized with Covid in the US."
18368,"https://www.cdc.gov/flu/about/burden-averted/2017-2018.htm

And that is WITH restrictions."
18369,Without restrictions we would have a flu season too right now on top of far worse Covid numbers and hospital systems all over the country would be unable to perform basic care.
18370,"Makes sense - Czech testing numbers are quite respectable, even a bit more than Germany's lately."
18371,Poland ....... not so much.
18372,But we are not expecting a different result.
18373,"A result like we got in the summer of 2020 would be absolutely ideal, cases and deaths dropped dramatically and this time we have a vaccine so the cases are unlikely to rebound."
18374,Boring answer.
18375,Money.
18376,[removed]
18377,I'm confused.
18378,Are we hating China or the WHO more?
18379,The large majority of people aren't outraged because they either don't know anyone who has covid or they know of someone who recovered just fine.
18380,For them the worst thing about this pandemic has been the restrictions.
18381,It irrationally pisses me off that people think wanting to go back to normal is not a legitimate reason to want the vaccine.
18382,"I say irrationally because I know it’s literally only Reddit where someone would say that, but it still pisses me off."
18383,U.S. could elect competent individuals that would not put us into this predicament but we don’t.
18384,"Thanks to Peru, Ecuador, Bolivia, Mexico and Iran who underestimate by less than half."
18385,And Spain is not joking either
18386,EKG/cardiac technician :)
18387,&gt; How did it save NYC?
18388,The death rate there was one of the highest in the world.
18389,But no where near the worst case scenario because of the lockdown.
18390,His crime was drinking a malt without paying his 25 cents
18391,Thank you!
18392,"I just realised I miss read 'Tuesday to Friday', as 'Tuesday and Friday'."
18393,"No I’m not holding anything against you for being American at all, no arguments here."
18394,I Was just making a point how different it is there to here ( Ireland ).
18395,"When I was in America on every single advertisement they always mention every side effect possible, mainly the big one - may cause death."
18396,I remember this clear as day because it was for an over the counter cough medicine I was drinking at the time haha.
18397,I’m guessing this is down to lawsuits.
18398,Whereas over here there’s very little of that talk at all.
18399,Everyone is a little hesitant to take the vaccine- even myself - but I will.
18400,"So I get why it’s extra scary for Americans because the companies ( or state ) don’t want millions of law suits so they have to really make it clear this may not be safe, where in reality if you look at the statistics on trial runs ( of all vaccines combined, they’re all essentially the same ), they have gone through as many trials as the normal flu vaccine."
18401,"I just think it should be mandatory for people who deal with the vulnerable- nurses, doctors, police etc."
18402,should be setting an example.
18403,"&gt;Reinfection is still rare

Reinfection is very common."
18404,Difficulty fighting subsequent infections is rare.
18405,A person may be infected by the same common cold virus dozens of times and only show symptoms the first time.
18406,"Hence the term ""snot nosed kids""."
18407,"Yes, it's absurd to say New Zealand has done better than the USA."
18408,You simply can't compare them.
18409,Well just one week may not be enough time to be 100% you are over it.
18410,But all indications are that the overwhelming majority of people develop a good level of immunity from an infection and there is no indication thus far than any of the different variants of the virus are able to escape that immunity.
18411,"Government needs to make mask wearing illegal, then Americans be like,’ Hell no, they not gonna tell me what I can and can’t do’
All of a sudden, everyone will be wearing masks
🤣🤣🤣"
18412,[removed]
18413,"Everyone is going out and partying like normal, plus the bars and clubs are still open."
18414,I took a lyft and the driver told me that 9 out of his last 10 rides were all people from out of state coming here to party because we werent locked down
18415,"yet there are an alarming amount of people still calling it ""china flu"" therefore it's important to note ambiguities"
18416,Translation: 1 in 17 on I-5 has the plague and headed somewhere else to spread it.
18417,I want an onion article showing that the mortality rate was reversed because of how good they are.
18418,"""The dead walk again thanks to safe covid practices"""
18419,Still robust immunity to SARS1 17 years later for most.
18420,"Not only Redditors, and it's not just pessimism."
18421,It's hateful negativity.
18422,well that does not sound good.
18423,I find this interesting because I had awful diarrhea and zero appetite back in March prior to a positive AB test for Covid-19.
18424,"In March I could not get a test so I never tested positive via PCR, it was only confirmed in June when I had an antibody test performed by my healthcare provider."
18425,Germany was so close to containment this summer.
18426,So sad to see the people give up their efforts a few months too soon.
18427,I can’t even imagine what’s running through that person on the rights head
18428,Our government has failed to procure any arrangement to actually get the vaccine.
18429,"Last news I read, they were planning to buy enough for 3% of the population in order to vaccinate healthcare workers."
18430,No further news.
18431,"Oh, just heartbreaking."
18432,😭
18433,Its frightening to see how unpopular good news stories like this are vs stories focussing on worst case scenarios like possible mass reinfection.
18434,It's an insight into the mind of the neurotic.
18435,[removed]
18436,[removed]
18437,That your normal life was indistinguishable from a once-in-a-century pandemic shutting down nearly all social gatherings doesn’t make you interesting.
18438,Have had a mild headache and a bit of nausea but forced myself to eat and feel much better.
18439,Congrats to you!
18440,It’s very surreal.
18441,"My county allows a 6 month no questions asked postponement, which I took."
18442,"There was a slight problem with the automated phone system (it's not done on a web site, only on the phone), so I spoke to a clerk to confirm postponement, and I specifically cited COVID as the reason though not required, largely because it's ludicrous that we're having in-person jury trials."
18443,I am in a pro-science part of the country.
18444,"I need to wear a mask when I open the door for my USPS mail carriers, or they give me funny looks and hand me the package at arms length, or set it down on the front doorstep."
18445,I think you might be agreeing with me.
18446,"I'm referring to the fact that once relief comes in the spring, going into the late spring/early summer, as the experts are predicting, there is going to be a measurable reduction in the severity of the pandemic combined with a group of people who will have trouble letting go and aren't mentally prepared for the problem to be pretty much solved, who will try to leverage the extra-cautious ""out of an abundance of caution"" stance of experts with abnormally low risk tolerance into continued masks and distancing."
18447,"It seems like by late spring deaths and hospitalizations should be lower, and will be kept permanently low by vaccines, and by then our risk assessment should kick in and allow us to move away from the precautions that are justified now even if some (but not all!)"
18448,experts start getting skittish about it.
18449,"In other words, we can relax mask requirements and go mostly back to normal, maybe not all the way, *before* herd immunity, in between vaccination of priority groups and herd immunity."
18450,"You work from home, and have poor people deliver food for you, putting themselves at risk so you can enjoy your ivory tower."
18451,Get a reality check
18452,"Heavy on *aspiration*, light on optimism."
18453,So the real problem is that many protesters died OUTSIDE of the square instead of inside?
18454,Or that more than 300 people were executed instead of a thousand?
18455,"Please, we are not discussing the scale of fatalities or where exactly they happened."
18456,We are discussing about how this country COMPLETELY CENSORS what happened that day and still refuses to acknowledge the people executed afterwards or the whole event ever occuring.
18457,"Yes, a race war to fire up the country!"
18458,You are comparing him to athletes?
18459,Sounds like an honest man
18460,Another year of this and think I'd rather die than live in this bleak limbo.
18461,These pics were just taken.
18462,Not 8 yrs.
18463,ago.
18464,😣
18465,Lmao dude.
18466,Big difference between weight and body fat percentage.
18467,Plus the only athletes who have died that i heard about were college lineman.
18468,It's not really optimism.
18469,We are at roughly half a million a day right now.
18470,How many were we at a week ago?
18471,"This time next week we could very well be at a million a day if we aren't supply limited (which allegedly the feds have 20M ready to be sent to states for 2nd doses, so if that's true then we shouldn't be supply limited)"
18472,"Honestly I'd rather have trump, at least you guys are getting vaccinated."
18473,The government procrastinated (yes procrastinated!)
18474,the vaccination plan and now we don't have neither vaccines or needles.
18475,God forbid thinking about setting a date for the vaccination to actually begin.
18476,"Of course it's useful, but it's not a panacea, no one thing is."
18477,"Other viruses, influenza comes to mind, can live quite well on surfaces as covid can to some extent, Anything you do to slow transmission is good but it seems the airborne aspect is by far the most important factor."
18478,"A layered defense is always best, you have auto insurance, but you also hopefully do other thiings to protect yourself and your investment."
18479,We do so horrible in this country because we let idiocy have a voice.
18480,"I feel like a bunch of people drive worse than usual in my city, maybe has something to do with Covid."
18481,I’m shocked by how much shit a brain can hold.
18482,"But they aren’t roughs round the edges, they are fucking awesome: when taken in a regimen they were designed to be taken in."
18483,"90%+ effectiveness is perfectly fine, basically 50% is not as good by a lot."
18484,"Doesn’t mean it isn’t worth it, just could be sole consequences."
18485,The real issue here is that people are dying mainly because they are refusing to follow mitigation efforts.
18486,The vaccine would help this a lot but the same people who aren’t following mitigation efforts now are the ones who I worry about having 50% immunity and thinking they’re Superman.
18487,"&gt;There are 80,000 pharmacies in the US."
18488,"20,000 of them averaging 50 shots a day is one million doses per day."
18489,Let’s say we went with your plan from the very start.
18490,We distribute the available vaccine doses to every pharmacy in America and don’t worry about prioritization.
18491,"The day after the vaccine is approved, the front page of every newspaper reads “Every local pharmacy has 250 doses of the Covid vaccine to give out."
18492,First come first serve.” Do you think that would be any less of a shit show than what’s going on now?
18493,"Sure, you’d get them out fast."
18494,But there’d also be riots.
18495,"And most pharmacies aren’t anywhere near prepared to hand out shots all day long, let alone doing it in the middle of the brawls over who gets a shot and who has to wait a couple more months."

18519,"Masks, distance, ventilation/air flow is all that matters."
18520,Distance and ventilation isn’t talked about because it’s so expensive even though it’s effective.
18521,Hey I really hope you’re right.
18522,I’ve been feeling really hopeless about the next year of living this way.
18523,My situation could be 1000x worse but it’s pretty defeating to do the right thing all year and then read about how we’re not even close to the end.

My grandma is 86 and we’ve already had multiple Covid scares with her and there’s a mass-vaccination event for seniors in her county this week and she refuses to be vaccinated until her primary care doctor is."
18528,This is what the news does to people.
18529,It makes people hesitant to take the vaccine because they purposely play fucking devil’s advocate about the vaccine asking if it’s safe when the scientific consensus is that it’s fucking safe.
18530,They’re incredibly dishonest and blow up every single story about an adverse reaction to it or someone being infected after getting it or whether or not it’s effective and it’s severing public trust.

18549,The flu mutates much faster than COVID.
18550,When you get the flu again in a year or two you are getting a different strain.
18551,This is why they change the flu vaccine every year as new strains come out.
18552,What I'm talking about is reinfections from the same strain in a short period.of time.
18553,This is rare but does happen.
18554,This would be analogous to the reinfections with COVID.
18555,Keep those borders tight.

18588,And that was over the course of the entire decade long campaign.

18591,We have an entire Vietnam War's death total every two months.
18592,Excellent choice of vaccines and vaccination strategy by the Emirati leadership (the same goes to Bahrain).
18593,&gt; That is ridiculous.
18594,Coronavirus lock downs are a much bigger threat to humanity than coronavirus itself due to the risk of destroying the economy and unleashing an unforeseen title wave of conflict.
18595,"&gt; 
&gt; 

Crazy how countries with the harshest lockdowns had their economies recover the fastest."
18596,"&gt;I guess you could argue that coronavirus could cause us to lose our ""humanity"" by becoming selfish barbarians, who refuse to work together, try to steal election, hoard vaccines, try to use a tragedy for personal gain, etc."
18597,You mean like a certain party and person in power is trying to achieve right now?
18598,There's a limit to how long most people will tolerate lockdowns.
18599,Regardless of which mutations appear.
18600,&gt; My issue is with how low both of those are compared to modern vaccines.
18601,"you have to remember, before COVID the fastest turn-around time to develop and test a vaccine had been 4 years."
18602,"It does not surprise that these vaccines, put together in basically one year, might be a little ""rough around the edges"""
18603,Don't think for a minute that the local government doesn't come into play here.
18604,"State governments have so much power with handling Covid, it's ridiculous."
18605,Trump is to blame for that specifically.
18606,"Pritzker or Lightfoot could intervene here, but they aren't doing that."
18607,"That is an easy target there are 80,000 pharmacies in the US."

18670,I meant critical thinking skills etc.

18684,Super transmissible mumps requires 90%+ vaccination rate.
18685,"If covid gets a Rt boost from 2.5 to 3.2, that may take herd immunity from 60% to 70%."
18686,"If it's also more vaccine resistant, that's another boost on top."
18687,"For the US the 10% boost would require an extra 33M or so vaccinations, that's an extra month lost even at 1 Million vaccinations per day."
18688,"Yeah, but at least with covid we didn’t *willingly* send people to get killed."
18689,Wait a minute...
18690,Where’s your data to back this up big boy?

18699,I mean fire dept gets to fine your ass if you don’t have fire extinguishers and emergency exits that light up.
18700,"Yeah, I don’t know that there is a great solution, but hopefully our half-ass measures will be good enough and vaccine rollout fast enough that we get through this without another 300k deaths."
18701,"Sadly, I doubt we’ll get it done with under a million deaths."
18702,The second masks were mandatory in shops etc in my country the more people went shopping.
18703,"It's like ""now it's finally safe, let's all go together""."
18704,We have to keep reminding everyone COVID-19 came from China.
18705,&gt;If it's a race against time why have countries not declared war time measure and force any industry that can help manufacture the vaccine to manufacture it?
18706,Manufacturing isn't the problem.
18707,Distribution is the problem.
18708,We're trying to roll out a vaccine while simultaneously trying to keep the pandemic under control and treating the sick.
18709,The medical personnel that would normally be distributing the vaccine are either helping to take care of already sick patients or are coming down sick themselves.
18710,"Then you add the anti-vaxxers and all the other political bullshit to all of this, further slowing down efforts at rolling out the vaccine."
18711,"Then you have pandemic fatigue, the politics of mask wearing, and the realities of trying to keep the economy propped up all contributing to furthering the spread at an exponential rate."
18712,"Plus, we don't even know how long the vaccine works."
18713,"If the vaccine's effectiveness only lasts (for example) four months and it takes six months to achieve herd immunity through vaccination (and that's an optimistic estimate), and then have to worry about adjusting the vaccine for every mutation out there and getting those tested, approved and distributed we will be forever chasing our tails."
18714,"I know a lot of people don't want to admit it, but I think COVID is here to stay, and I think the time has come to start figuring out how we are going to make long-term changes to our society and our economy to cope with it."
18715,"Dog, our problem isnt production of vaccines, its states worrying more about criteria then just getting the vaccine out."
18716,No reason they shouldnt just go by age.
18717,I don't think they have data on the strains or variants like this.
18718,The strain has to be sequenced and this has not been done widely.
18719,They have only recently discovered that there are strains.
18720,The common tests don't identify strain.
18721,So there just isn't any info on this.
18722,One group of scientists said that the UK strain is more contagious because it binds to the human cells differently but even that is pretty late breaking news and has to be verified.
18723,Also doesn’t account for testing rates.
18724,Are teachers 10x more likely to be tested so more cases would be caught?

18756,why?
18757,"You say it's different, and also that you don't know."
18758,Not much of a reason there.
18759,What's the why?
18760,I think just tell them to wear some other kind of face covering?
18761,"https://abcnews.go.com/US/exempt-wearing-face-mask-covid-19-pandemic/story?id=71871707

""People with underlying chronic lung disease, such as COPD or asthma, should be able to wear a non-N95 facial covering without it affecting their oxygen or carbon dioxide levels,"" Dr. Albert Rizzo, chief medical officer for the American Lung Association, told ABC News, adding that ""masks have no detrimental effects, even in patients with chronic lung disease."""
18762,"When asked if people who have difficulty breathing with a face mask on should be exempt, he stated: ""There are many different facial covers or even shields that could be worn instead, if one cannot tolerate the conventional face mask."""
18763,"Rizzo said ""cases of exemption are very few and far between,"" and ""people with supplemental oxygen or compromised respiratory status which become short of breath even when walking might meet criteria, which in that case, going out in public is a health risk to the person."""
18764,More _expired_ doses?
18765,"Source, please."
18766,"Stuck in freezers, yes, expired, I find incredibly unlikely."
18767,Yeah that’s the first thing that ends when this eases up.
18768,Preventing long term (or even short term) disability is a pretty compelling reason to tie re-opening to declining spread rather than declining mortality imo.
18769,"A 30 year old might not die if they catch it, but wrecking their lungs for the rest of their life is a good reason to try our best to prevent that from happening"
18770,The blame will be placed where it belongs.
18771,Because that’s what adults do.
18772,Not narcissistic man babies who’ve never taken responsibility for anything in their lives and their sycophantic followers.

18776,"I was looking at like for like between two urban areas of roughly the same population, which I believe to be a fair approximation."

18782,No doctor or politician has actual say in it.
18783,"If people have had enough, vaccines or not, life has to move on, you just roll the dice and carry on."
18784,I don't know what is right or not but that's how it's going to be... and already is in many places.
18785,"That is not true in general, maybe it may be a hallmark of the current state of socio-political decay and polarization, but this country survived the Spanish Flu during wartime."
18786,"I can tell you that if this pandemic hit us 30 years ago....when GHWB was President, I think you would have seen the mass compliance with masks and social distancing needed to beat back this virus."

18802,It may take decades but eventually we’d be back to where we are now.
18803,I suspect this is a classic case of the bad apples making the headlines but the good apples remaining unknown.
18804,"I guess ""80-90% of health care workers nationwide embrace the vaccine"" doesn't make a click-worthy headline."

18811,What if
18812,One thing that I was appreciative of the govt was that they did not instruct pple not to use mask despite an obvious shortage.
18813,Instead there was plenty of AD to educate the public on the right way to put on a mask.
18814,There were also plenty of program out there to debunk myths such as sterilzing used mask with rice cooker or alcohol.
18815,I guess Taiwan really learnt from SARS.
18816,Also thanks to those asshole at WHO that reminded us that we are alone.
18817,They will not lift a finger to help Taiwan even during a global pandemic

18821,&gt;We’ve known this from the beginning.
18822,It’s ridiculous to think at this point that we should still be relying on that one report from Wuhan.
18823,We have more information now.
18824,That information includes evidence of outdoor spread at a certain rate.
18825,I'm just waiting for people to start saying we need to stay at home every winter now to help slow the spread of the flu.

18838,So being in hallway near someone for a short time may be less risky than being in a classroom further away but for a much longer time.
18839,Or not.
18840,We don't actually know for sure.
18841,"&gt; After the cloud slows sufficiently, ventilation, specific patterns of airflow, and type of activity become important."

18865,"I'm in Finland and don't really know why we've done so well compared to Europe, but in many senses we're almost like an island - the Russian border is already strictly controlled and easy to close/limit crossings, the areas near the Northern borders are in very sparsely populated, and the rest is actual water."

18898,"a donation does not mean they can hop the line, THEY BRIBED."
18899,THAT'S WHAT THEY DID.
18900,IT'S NOT A FUCKING DONATION.
18901,"is exactly like parents ""donating"" money to UNIs so their stupid sons can get accepted."
18902,"""oh but that maybe accelerates the process""."
18903,what tells you that?
18904,there is no way that can be the case when frontline workers and side sanitary workers still did not get their shot.
18905,or not all of them.
18906,"you know that a Nurse/physician has to stop work if they result positive, right?"
18907,(except emergency cases).
18908,and if they fking die you likely have no replacement?
18909,"how is that accelerating the process, when they are the ones vaccinating people?"
18910,at best it doesn't change the speed.
18911,i'm not even American thanks god.
18912,but fk you
18913,"yep, very little noise outside of ambulances and the church bells from 10 blocks away."
18914,quite an experience...
18915,Why are they still investigating in China for the coronavirus origins when we new know that it was found earlier in Italy meaning that China was not the origin ?
18916,"&amp;#x200B;

Did I miss something ?"
18917,"Even on Reddit, people denied it."
18918,No one believed this would really affect their own healthcare.
18919,"Now people are waiting hours for an ambulance, regardless of what you need it for."
18920,"If you don't have the money / insurance for a private hospital right now, you're screwed."
18921,Curbside is available in many different places.
18922,"Place your order online, drive or walk up, they'll bring it out to you."
18923,"It's free in most places, and they say the baggers won't take tips but they've accepted all the ones I've left in my trunk for them."
18924,I was wondering how Dr. Dre made it into an ICU last night given the COVID situation in SoCal.
18925,"Your comment has been removed because

18933,"There were some studies early on that broke the illness from the virus into 6 categories:

https://covid.joinzoe.com/us-post/covid-clusters

The symptoms range from mild to severe and certain symptoms such as abdominal pain only appear in one category."
18934,"There should probably be a 7th category which is asymptomatic, which has not been studied much probably for obvious reasons."
18935,You would have to find a population of people that test positive but don't have symptoms and then study them.
18936,I thought this was interesting and as they understand more about this I think they will have a better idea of what the virus does.
18937,It is entirely possible that other viruses generate an asymptomatic response in people but we have just never studied it because it has never been a big deal.
18938,The flu is deadly but in most years is within tolerable levels apparently.
18939,I do agree that Fauci has really been bundling his communication.
18940,"His early comments really did not age well, as late as late February he was basically saying there was little risk."
18941,But then subsequent comments were clearly designed to illicit the most cautious response in the public rather than actually informing them.
18942,"He admitted this in a recent interview, said that he was telling people what he thought they were ready to hear."
18943,The allegations that he has been moving the goalposts in terms of immunity and lockdowns are spot on in my opinion.
18944,He has lost or is losing credibility with parts of the public which is too bad because we need someone to be communicating.
18945,"I don't want to make this political but in a normal government, Fauci would be a top advisor to a leader who would be turning his input into a good message for the public to hear which is both informative and gives them actionable guidance."
18946,"Not OP but he's probably referring to [Cuomo's recent comments](https://abc7ny.com/parcare-vaccine-fraud-attorney-general-ny-covid/9143911/)
  
Basically ParCare clinic obtained vaccine doses and started distributing them to persons not on the State's priority list."
18947,Cuomo calls it fraud and will seek to sign an EO that would fine such actions up to $1MM.
18948,Won't happen until April earliest.
18949,The EMA doesn't find the present data convincing and will wait for the results of the US study.
18950,"Oh, I see."
18951,&gt;Decentralised countries like the USA face significant red tape bureaucracy.
18952,With no decisive leadership at the top to coordinate the response everybody is running around like headless chickens.
18953,This doesn't pass even the most basic of scrutiny.
18954,"Hospitals have been handed doses of the vaccine, guidance on who to prioritize, and online access to report usage."
18955,Plus tons of handy online guides from the CDC.
18956,"Surely the hospitals don't need the federal government to oversee the process of opening the freezer, pulling the vials out, and putting needles in arms?"
18957,Ask her for proof of this non existent quote
18958,I couldn't agree more.
18959,Quelle surprise
18960,"I was talking about the MMR vaccine, but you do you."
18961,"No, that was one of the leaders of the union."
18962,Most of Australia has been good.
18963,Just a couple of states.
18964,We have been pretty much living normal lives here in WA since June
18965,The fatality rate is fortunately low but we are only beginning to see the longer term effects of having the disease.
18966,The scariest of these is the increase that is being seen in people throwing clots.
18967,mRNA has been being studied for decades now but with like anything new there are unknowns.
18968,"It is a personal choice and for me, based on the research I have studied and the doctors I have talked to made this an easy one for  me."
18969,That should absolutely not be the case.
18970,The federal government is already holding back the second dose.
18971,The states are free to distribute 100% of the vaccine they have and not worry about the second dose because that is already reserved in federal storage.
18972,The states doing that as well would mean we are only using 25% of the vaccine supply.
18973,"Australia and China are two of the biggest, and we're both doing pretty well"
18974,There is a reason the United States is the only first world democracy with a Presidential system of government.
18975,"It's a poor system for a large, diverse electorate and they usually collapse into authoritarian regimes."
18976,"It lasted this long because up until fifty years or so ago the only electorate that mattered and had a voice in government was very narrow, wealthy white business owners."
18977,Now that the rest of the population is striving for representation the system is collapsing.
18978,The US needs to adopt a parliamentary system if it's going to survive at all.
18979,We built them but we don’t have staff for them
18980,Its delicious if you put it in a pie.
18981,"Like crust, whipped peanut butter, boom that's it."
18982,this is the kinda headline that makes me say I told you we needed to do a list of people refusing to wear masks and social distance.
18983,"I (and many, many people, I'm sure) would definitely prefer that to be a factor in this situation"
18984,I get what you are saying then.
18985,Well Im open if you have any data between coronaspread in classrooms and coronaspread in hallways.
18986,"To me the logic is sound, the science says direct contact to infected person and inhaling the droplets."
18987,It cant get more direct than being in a packed hallway but hey maybe the ventilation in classrooms are better than I thought.
18988,"It is a claim I am willing to make, if you have proof otherwise Im all ears."
18989,Is it at all possible that this is because they’re on an island with less commercial air traffic than the US among other countries with the possibility of a low number of initial infections?
18990,"Not talking down the response, just want to know if there are other possible confounding factors."
18991,I think they have given up saying two more weeks.
18992,As you can see from above.
18993,"Now, it is 3 months and as stated above some of it is next winter."
18994,Society won't get back to normal until people make it a priority and likely have to march in the streets to get it.
18995,Requires a previous higher mark as the startpoint.
18996,It was already pretty dang low for those who made this more a problem than it needed to be
18997,Capable?
18998,"I mean I'm capable of winning the lotto, but statistically speaking, well, I still haven't quit my day job 😉."
18999,So basically if you live in southern california and you can GTFO...you should do so.
19000,"Lol guys it's not Trump's fault, I live in Canada it's a shit show here too."
19001,"The government sucks plain and simple, we have been led by morons for so long now that something drastic is happening....we are fucked cause our leaders are literal monkeys

We are first world richbass countries and our government could not organize after 11 months."
19002,I'm not trying to defend Trump I'm just saying incompetent government is the issue.
19003,I for one welcome the upcoming New Zealand Empire
19004,"They're going to commit crime anyway, so why not make crime legal."
19005,No shit fuaci.
19006,Why do people think we had it control?
19007,So much arrogance for a species that don’t even understand their damn brain completely.
19008,It’s obvious.
19009,You can’t say this was only because of the pandemic.
19010,There was also a lot of civil unrest between Law Enforcement and the African American community last year.
19011,"""Systematic racism against POC"", or something."
19012,God isn't America just so awful for POC!
19013,Should just delete facebook honestly.
19014,"Cuomo is not a reality TV star, and he didn't say that nurses were the ones stealing PPE!"
19015,"The U.S. has so many layers of government, and so many politicians blame the federal level for everything."
19016,Why not remove the state and local levels if the federal government is always the responsible level?
19017,https://www.cnbc.com/amp/2020/03/06/people-are-stealing-face-masks-from-local-hospitals-gov-cuomo-says.html?__twitter_impression=true
19018,Cases are rising and hotspots are growing.
19019,If we don't lockdown again a bit things could go off very quickly and easily because everyone is so complacent .
19020,"Tell that to the Americans - I'm not one of them, nor I live there."
19021,Well that was about the extent of the lock down in Spain.
19022,"Stay in your house, only can go to the supermarket once a week - and they checked."
19023,Yeah it's disappointing but you have to remember we have potentially three vaccines on the way.
19024,The numbers Hogan cited were based on the current rate of federal allocation of doses.
19025,"J&amp;J is most likely gonna be approved in February and will give the US 100m doses, effectively increasing our supply by 50% while taking only one shot so being easier to administer."
19026,"If AZ is approved in April who knows how much faster we could move, the US gov't bought 300m doses enough for 150m people and the AZ vaccine is cheap and fast to manufacture."
19027,That's not even mentioning novavax which would increase supply even more.
19028,We'll get through this!
19029,What is the point of this?
19030,"Knowing more people died somewhere else won't bring 3,900 people back"
19031,"Very unhealthy essential worker local population and 70,000+ homeless people allowed to just constantly throw garbage and defecate in the streets."
19032,I moved out of LA in October because I got so tired of seeing human feces on my street everyday.
19033,Can confirm: I know a hospital finance executive that was vaccinated yesterday.
19034,Imagine thinking a Harvard degree means nothing in New Zealand
19035,"Fine, but with vaccines and more protection in the community - it’s an increased risk of another flu."
19036,Doesn’t mean we have to shut everything down every winter.
19037,Good luck trying to put the sad face on and telling people to not have a second Christmas.
19038,50% of Canadians didn’t listen this time.
19039,100% won’t listen next.
19040,I’m just saying that if I read a science-based article from a virologist I’m more likely to believe it than a article from a fiction novelist.
19041,Never said it wasn’t a true story.
19042,I didn’t have time to read and check primary sources.
19043,No knock on him.
19044,He might be correct.
19045,I’m a PharmD and MPH and know how to evaluate literature and like to go to the primary journal reference whenever I have time.
19046,I almost always google the author of what I am reading to check for any potential bias.
19047,"It’s a good habit, I think, for critical thinking."
19048,Not looking to get into a pissing contest here - just explaining my rationale.
19049,Any Federal guidelines would be just that - guidelines - and wouldn't stop stories like this.
19050,States ultimately are the ones dispensing the vaccine.
19051,Some people may eventually get it.
19052,"At my sister's clinic, several of her coworkers said they want to wait and see."
19053,"I think if they want to wait and see though, a dose should not be held for them."
19054,[Nope](https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/typical-year-covid-deaths/)
19055,Someone gave this a wholesome award.
19056,Republicans keep saying children aren’t household vectors so it’s safe to reopen schools but Ive known that was political bs since day one.
19057,"If you say wash your hands, wear a mask, and don’t touch your face: kids are the least likely to remember."
19058,"Plus, they take after their parents."
19059,I can’t forget a woman mid lockdown wearing her mask on her chin and having three kids wearing masks on their chins walking through the grocery store speaking loudly and touching everything mid-year.
19060,Sigh.

19062,"Airline tickets seem like the easiest thing to do this for, as every adult has their own ticket assigned to their name when they purchase it and you can’t really transfer them."
19063,Concerts and sports seem much more complicated.
19064,What if I’m buying 4 tickets on stubhub for tickets that were originally bought on Ticketmaster?
19065,I think it can hit 5k in about a week or two.
19066,He is right.
19067,"The correct way of doing it is suppressing the spread as much as possible (summer in Europe), and roll out a vaccine quickly."
19068,"As we have very high numbers of infected, and the vaccine roll out is slow, the virus will have enough chances to mutate and select in favor of vaccine-resistant strains."
19069,"This is inevitable, but the extend of vaccine-resistance will depend on luck."
19070,"Unfortunately most people will get Covid before the vaccine (UK is well on their way), and at the end we will have a relatively resistant population as a result of natural infection + vaccination."
19071,Together with reinfections and vaccine-resistant strains circulating around.
19072,Getting vials seem to be the issue at the moment
19073,It's wonderful to see a country that actually cares about its citizens.
19074,But the hospital is also out the labor and staff time administering the vaccine?
19075,[removed]
19076,That’s one of my thoughts also.
19077,You mean that living people who spend the majority of their paycheck on essentials are what make the economy run?
19078,Why didn't literally every single study of economies and how they function effectively say that?!

19080,Except no one politician rules america.
19081,You have an elementary student's grasp of American politics.
19082,"Eh, it's gonna get better soon."
19083,"I know it sux right now, and it will get worse before it gets better, but we all knew this was coming."
19084,"Just hang tight guys, don't give up."
19085,2-3 months tops and things will really start looking up.
19086,"We came this far, we can survive a bit longer."
19087,"Stay strong and remember, you are not in this alone!"
19088,"just when we have two new variants that are more contagious, we should have a bunch of kids breathe the same air for hours a day."
19089,"Holy shit, idiology."
19090,"I don't think there will be a competition for straightforward deaths, but definitely in human impact."
19091,"Careers stunted or extinguished, marriages and children postponed, first time homebuyers stymied, loss of housing and economic security... All the instability that will have knock on effects for years, decades, or lifetimes to come."
19092,"No one will really allow that to be compared to death, but when you consider years of life lost for many of the deaths is likely only a few they're not so far off."
19093,It’s more of a dis’ on French.
19094,It would still be cool to have some statistcis how many healthcare workers will or already got the vaccine and how many don't want it.
19095,To be honest 10% refusing to get it would be bad enough.
19096,Keep in mind that vaccination was already required for traveling to some countries.
19097,For those in the U.S.: [https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel)
19098,"Except that they did find traces of the virus in italy when restesting samples from 2019 : 

https://www.thehealthsite.com/news/covid-19-started-circulating-in-italy-months-before-1st-case-was-reported-785900/

https://eu.usatoday.com/story/news/factcheck/2020/07/07/fact-check-coronavirus-found-march-2019-wastewater-sample/5350878002/

Of course that doesn't prevent the fact that China with its huge population density will have become one of the main initial super spreaders places and where the virus will have been identified first, but it also means that if the investigation was really about the virus origin, logic says that it should have been sent to Italy, or at least in Europe in a more general sense, to check for the oldest traces known."
19099,"Not for long, the robots are coming."
19100,So soon we won’t need healthy people.
19101,/s unless you are bezos
19102,Are they at high risk?
19103,WhY CaNt mURICa jUSt Do wHAT Nz DiD?!
19104,?
19105,That is exactly my point.
19106,It is just so sad to watch what all of the essential workers have to go through with so many people ignoring the warnings.
19107,It's just so rude and arrogant of everyone to make all of the essential workers going through this so dangerous times right now.
19108,That's not true.
19109,We do have better health care now but the 1918 flu was still far deadlier.
19110,"For example, the 1918 flu had 50x the death rate in younger populations (10% vs 0.2%) that Covid has."
19111,"Think about it, not even 5% of young adults (sub 35) with Covid have to be hospitalized or require medical care of any sort, let alone die."
19112,Even in a hypothetical case where we had no medical care of any sort the 1918 Influenza would still kill far more people.
19113,"The 1918 influenza death rate (10%) is higher even than the total Covid hospitalization rate (2.5-5%), let alone death rate."
19114,"It’ll be interesting to see if flu becomes less of a problem in the future thanks to 1-2 years of covid measures such as extra hand washing, social distancing and masks."
19115,So did Canada
19116,Well it's actually in their interests to have this visit.
19117,It was only ever going to be a carefully choreographed rubber stamping exercise to validate the CCP story.
19118,"Then afterwards, the CCP can forever refer to the visit as proof of their version of events."
19119,Don't expect anything informative to come from this visit.
19120,Everyone I have known that lived in Texas has implied this is the only way to keep their section from the idiot's sections.

You could also try a busy board, or bubble/ paint play in an empty bathtub while you work nearby....?"
19129,"At that age, nothing keeps their attention long."
19130,That's really tough.
19131,I would 100% stand in line for a chance at the vaccine even if I didn’t get it.
19132,I think a lot of people would.
19133,From the New York Times: “It is now considered unlikely that anyone was actually killed in Tiananmen Square”.
19134,"https://www.nytimes.com/1998/06/27/world/clinton-in-china-the-site-clinton-in-beijing-square-may-tread-on-the-ghosts.html

19138,"Antibody drugs target one particular part of the spike protein, so it is much easier for the virus to evade those."
19139,The vaccine produces many different antibodies which target different parts of the spike protein.
19140,It is much more difficult for the virus to evade the vaccine.
19141,I don't think there are any scientists who think that the vaccine is completely ineffective against any of the virus variants (worst case is just slightly less effective).
19142,"Trust me, the side effects of this virus (unemployment, despair, lost of socialization) are going to be so much worse than the actual deaths and sicknesses from this virus."
19143,"When this is all over, 500K americans will have died and millions more will have long term health issues, but hundreds of millions of americans will be fucking ruined by the unintended consequences."
19144,"I suspect if the situation were bad enough, the government wouldn't really care about this and would bring in martial law or whatever else was needed to maintain a lockdown."
19145,I'm sure this administration would be willing to act first and then worry about legality after if it suited them.
19146,The main thing is that there wasn't even really any will to seriously try and contain this because the US government hasn't seen it as a serious threat from the beginning.
19147,the report you linked is not considered a scientific publication since it was never peer reviewed... or published in a respectable scientific journal.
19148,To simply put it its just not research at all...
19149,I didnt make any conclusion about the efficacy of single dose regimen i merely stated as did the article the efficacy was 52% between dose 1  and dose 2.
19150,Figure 3 of the article.
19151,"When you dont have scientific and medical training everything is easy but when you have a license to maintain, liabilities, and you are also an researcher... you realize if the trial was not designed to assess the efficacy of a single dose regimen.. maybe we should stick to the two dose schedule and not try to take the data from a trial not designed for that purpose and go slice and dice to make numbers up."
19152,Anyhow agree to disagree.
19153,"Poland this morning just reported a sharp rise, 553 deaths from the virus, that's the US equivalent of 4,811 deaths"
19154,"You cant give a number can you 😂 

Everything else you've listed isn't just dependent on rate of infections you know?"
19155,"It's not moving goal posts, it is a genuine question that should be asked - I'm sure you are well aware of the trade off with the other tests and their accuracies?"
19156,You could make the same argument around mask laws.
19157,Our national strategy is not one of eradication of the virus.
19158,I want to travel to NZ and China when Canada is ever done with this virus.
19159,😔😔
19160,Total incompetence.
19161,Priority is a good idea but it's not working.
19162,They need to be vaccinating people as soon as they get the vaccines.
19163,They need to set up vaccination centers all over the place.
19164,Get the army involved get the national guard involved.
19165,Wtf is Newsom doing?
19166,He is so damn currupt and incompetent
19167,"All countries are islands if you properly close the borders and do a proper hard lockdown for a short duration (relative to half ass lengthy ""lockdowns"" aka restrict some businesses)"
19168,Just gotta break the freezers every time a shipment comes in to speed up vaccinations
19169,"Wow, this is good news, even deaths from other transmittable illnesses are down leading to overall decrease in death"
19170,"Enough that the data remains consistent with every other metric like excess death, burial and crematorium reports."
19171,Wanna move the goal posts some more?
19172,"That was true for my country as well, from March to about October."
19173,We entered a complete lockdown with barely 8 cases in the country and it went really well.
19174,We had a normal summer.
19175,The population started thinking everything was fine.
19176,And then at the start of October it happened.
19177,By January we were at the top of the lists and have almost caught Italy in deaths per capita.

Conclusion: always be vigilant."

19188,We also can't do that for [insulin](https://www.princewilliamtimes.com/news/new-virginia-law-capping-insulin-prices-at-50-a-month-goes-into-effect-friday/article_cc1ea210-4a26-11eb-9ca2-dbcea0627c72.html?fbclid=IwAR0MA6jbLJjl0fz8QwTkKaBOCFI74LiB3Bb4GVWvm2Ro2VCeEVKgyeSgBx0) or anything else.
19189,We're completely powerless.
19190,"I'm not from the US, but where I work ""out of hospital cardiac arrest"" -patients walk home in about 20% of the cases."
19191,"So not great, but very much not zero."
19192,"If my job is at a hospital or involves going into hospitals multiple times per week/month, it is easier for me to get the vaccine."
19193,Think of it like a grocery store.
19194,It is easier/quicker to ring up 100 items for 1 person than 1 item for 100 people.
19195,"The individual burden may be less but that isn't what is most important, right now speed is."
19196,And I don't even know if I believe it.
19197,A healthcare worker as described may see getting the vaccine as a priority even if that means missing an hour of sleep.
19198,Get as many people vaccinated as soon as possible.
19199,The current groups are the easiest to administer shots to.
19200,"They are familiar with the facilities, the process, and there is most likely an abundance of people that can actually administer the shots."

19204,?
19205,"I am not a teacher, nor have any family that is."
19206,The idea that teachers all have the same thoughts and concerns for the kids and remote learning is just CRAZY!!
19207,!
19208,I wouldn't go so far as to say that the scientists don't know.
19209,The UK and SA variants have infected millions of people.
19210,"If they were deadlier, we would expect some evidence that they were deadlier."
19211,The fact that there is no such evidence is a pretty good indicator that they are not deadlier.
19212,It's more often the case that the media distorts things in a more negative direction (since fear generates clicks).
19213,"For example, a couple of scientists have said that they are ""concerned"" that the vaccines might be a bit less effective against the SA variant."
19214,"Certain articles have distorted this to ""scientists say that the vaccines don't work on the SA variant""."
19215,This is despite the fact that there is no real possibility that the vaccines are completely ineffective (just slightly less effective) and there's still a good chance that the efficacy of the vaccines is not reduced at all.
19216,"Yours are the exact symptoms of my dad, he was covid positive,  you should get tested for the good of all your close ones..."
19217,It's like this all over the country.

19223,Keep it up pal and stay safe
19224,I cannot wrap my head around why they are scrambling to find people to vaccinate.
19225,Did they really just ask for an arbitrary amount of doses?
19226,How hard would have been to get the people that wanted it to sign up and have an appointment before you even requisitioned the doses?
19227,No.
19228,Even the article you quote says there “could” be restrictions next winter if we can’t manage it today.
19229,He never said there will still be restrictions.
19230,You need to understand that a new even more infectious version needs urgent containment and it will be very hard to contain even with these measures.
19231,lol how can you still be following mainstream media at this point
19232,No shit.
19233,People who pretend that schools are somehow safe are fucking morons.

19256,It’s called winter ... and lockdowns don’t work.
19257,Ireland and Germany show that impressively
19258,"Before dose 2	| 	Vaccine cases	| 	Placebo cases	| 	Efficacy	| 	95% CI

Without first 14  days after dose 1	

| 	2	| 	27	| 	**92.3%**	| 	69-98%

Alright, so what those numbers mean is that if you take everyone from the moment they got their first dose until they get the second one, 52% of them are immune."
19259,"If you remove the people who got it less than 7 days ago, immunity is at 68.3%."
19260,"If you isolate only the people that got only the first dose more than 14 days before getting tested, they are immune at 92.7%."
19261,"So yeah, immunity ON AVERAGE is at 52% from first to second dose, but you're including people who got it one day ago and won't get a second dose for another 20 days and will develop an immunity in 92.7% of cases by then."
19262,These people are irrelevant when I say that getting only the first dose makes people immune in 92.7% of cases as they just didn't have the time to develop that immunity yet.
19263,"Man, that's just wrong"
19264,and denied the second dose
19265,"Umm, I thought we were talking about which of corridors or classrooms are more risky for spread."
19266,Children defintely spread it.

19593,"It’s crazy to me that people think we can explain hundreds of thousands of Covid-19 deaths as people coincidentally dying of an unrelated cause in the brief period they are infected, but a single case of someone dying 2 days after receiving the vaccine would be cause for panic."
19594,"Like you said though, it’s a tragedy no matter what the cause of death is found to be."
19595,"No, many of the people included in that number received the second dose on the normal three-week window."
19596,"The secondary analysis in Table 4 doesn't separate out by duration for the second dose - it's a meta-analysis of all study participants across all dosage regimens, no matter when they received Dose 2."
19597,"The answer to _that_ question is actually in Table 3, and while numbers seem very comparable between &lt;8 weeks and &gt;8 weeks (which is good news) the sample sizes are fairly small when the data is sliced that way, so more research is needed."
19598,But all of this is for two doses.
19599,"Your original post talks about a single dose:

&gt; The idea is that a single dose of the vaccine reduce the chance of getting infected by roughly ~70% (64.1% specifically, bc y’all are sticklers)

And the data doesn't support that claim, because the 64.1% number you are citing is not only examining the period of time when patients had only received one dose."
19600,It includes protection from the full duration of the study and from the delivery of both doses.
19601,"None of that tells us what a single dose's efficacy is, because every study participant received two doses (even the ones who were intended to receive only one at study outset)."
19602,"We only have very limited data by examining the short term results during the period before patients got their second booster shot, and they don't break that out separately except for hospitalizations."
19603,"The best strategy for the UK would be to focus on fully immunizing as many high risk patients as possible as quickly as possible with the vaccines we know work well - Pfizer and Moderna - at their manufacturer-intended, clinical trial-tested dosages and schedules."
19604,The vast majority of hospitalizations are being driven by the high risk portion of the population.
19605,"A focus on peanut buttering broader, less-effective immunization across the whole population is more for economic benefit."
19606,The rollout in so many parts of the US seems to be based more on virtue signalling support for medical workers than pragmatism.
19607,"With a vaccine that eliminates serious COVID, it seems like the pragmatic approach is targeting the rollout to audiences that are at the highest risk for serious COVID."
19608,"While medical workers are impacted by COVID, they also work in full PPE day in day out in a carefully controlled environment."
19609,Many people working in hospitals are also younger and at substantially lower risk for serious disease.
19610,Rollouts targeted at people in certain age groups seem substantially simpler to administer and more accurately target the problem we're actually trying to solve here.
19611,Smart.
19612,Masks are being used for a reason.
19613,Do hospitals serve chicken wings claiming they're food?

19622,Seeing the at-risk population having to wait in long lines OUT of their cars is so cringeworthy.
19623,Many have been isolating until now but will possibly catch COVID while trying to get a vaccine.

19651,"Prior to the summer, Sweden was reporting every day."
19652,With the first wave ending and the summer holidays starting (which in Sweden means on average that people take something like four weeks in from mid-June to mid-August) they stopped the reporting on the weekends and later extended this to mondays as well.
19653,"Since the official numbers in Sweden are reported by the FHM at 14.00 based on the reports they get from the regions until 11.00 the same day, it always made the weekend and monday look uncharacteristically low and they had to always repeat that there are larger lags over the weekend as not all health or care providers would report the same day and then the regions wouldn't always be able to pass that report up to FHM in time for the monday update."
19654,"(Swedish health and care system is very decentralized, which makes assembling the national-wide reporting a bit more complicated than some other countries)."
19655,"There was also the comment that reporting that often doesn't change the situation in healthcare, only strains it further by stressing the staff to report more often; 

Personally, I liked when the updates were daily, but I also spent three months repeating to people that there is delay in reporting on Sat-Mon and there is also delays in death reporting and the deaths added on day A weren't deaths that occurred on day A, but were rather for previous days."
19656,"People just want to comment on the numbers, but if they don't understand the numbers in depth or context then any change in the numbers is suddenly a record."

The summer surge that raged across the Sun Belt started in Arizona."

19752,Hospitals were stretched thin.

19761,"At the same time, vaccines in the state are being administered at among the lowest rates in the country."
19762,"“Most Americans don’t want to know, don’t want to acknowledge, don’t really want to recognize and certainly — even as it’s descending upon us — do not appear to understand the dire circumstances that we are facing,” said Dr. Marjorie Bessel, the chief clinical officer at Banner Health, Arizona’s largest hospital network."
19763,Arizona is by no means alone in its struggle.
19764,"Nationally, it has become routine for more than 200,000 infections and more than 2,500 deaths to be announced in a single day."
19765,"California, Rhode Island, Tennessee and Oklahoma are all identifying cases at extraordinarily high rates."
19766,"More than 131,000 coronavirus patients were hospitalized across the country on Tuesday, a record, according to the Covid Tracking Project."

The outlook is especially alarming in Southern California."
19771,"In just two weeks, more than 240,000 cases had been identified in the Los Angeles metropolitan area."
19772,That is more cases than at least 19 entire states have identified over the entire pandemic.
19773,Hospitals have become so crowded that the Los Angeles County emergency medical services agency directed ambulances not to transport patients who cannot be resuscitated by emergency responders out in the field.
19774,"The hospital system in Arizona is not at that point yet, but it is close."
19775,"More than 4,600 coronavirus patients are currently hospitalized, forcing multiple hospitals to operate at over 120 percent of licensed bed capacity, send new emergency patients elsewhere and put a halt to elective surgeries."
19776,"Only 136 intensive care unit beds are available out of nearly 1,800 statewide, according to state data, but beds are not the most pressing issue, Dr. Bessel said."
19777,Staff and resources are.
19778,Nurses are being quickly trained in new skills and hundreds of health care workers are being flown in from other states.
19779,"Still, Dr. Bessel acknowledged, there comes a point when resources can be stretched no thinner and more drastic measures, such as rationing care, might have to be considered."

    Around the world, the new year looks a lot like the old one so far."
19782,"The largest hospital system in New York sued 2,500 patients for unpaid medical bills after the pandemic hit."
19783,"Arizona is facing ‘dire circumstances,’ its outbreak even worse than summer’s surge."
19784,"“We are doing everything we can to not get to that,” she said."
19785,"“Yet there are a lot of factors that I don’t have direct control of that are absolutely working against me.”

Will Humble, director of the Arizona Public Health Association, sees the case trajectory in Arizona very clearly following the deployment and retrenchment of state public health measures."
19786,"In mid-May, Gov."
19787,"Doug Ducey, a Republican, lifted stay-at-home orders, making Arizona one of the first states to reopen widely after the spring Covid-19 lockdowns."
19788,"While some mitigation measures remained in place, enforcement was sporadic, Mr. Humble said, and the number of cases quickly soared."
19789,"When the governor put in place stricter orders, such as closing bars and gyms and allowing cities and counties to declare mask mandates, cases dropped precipitously."
19790,"Many of the stricter measures were lifted weeks later, and there seemed to be little enforcement of the rules that remained in place, Mr. Humble said."
19791,"While the governor announced some measures aimed at curbing the virus in early December — and has urged people to follow recommended public health guidelines — he has consistently rebuffed appeals for more stringent restrictions, such as a statewide mask mandate, the cancellation of big sports events or a delay to the return of in-person schooling."

Mr. Ducey’s approach had already led to criticism, but he drew more attention this week, when footage emerged on social media of the governor’s son dining at a restaurant crowded with people, none of whom could be seen wearing face coverings."
19794,"“It just highlights what is possible in Arizona,” Mr. Humble said."
19795,“It’s not that his kid did it.
19796,"It’s that any kid could do it.”

Messages sent to the governor’s office seeking comment were not returned."
19797,"Support for stricter restrictions is far from unanimous in Arizona, where some politicians have dismissed the pandemic as a political ploy to hurt the president or compared public health restrictions to martial law."
19798,"Arizonans describe packed malls, grocery stores where few are masked and social media feeds full of pictures from crowded holiday parties."
19799,Few see additional closures and restrictions as likely — or even wanted by many people.
19800,"In April, Francisco Sirvent, a lawyer who lives in Chandler, a city southeast of Phoenix, started a Facebook group called “Reopen Arizona.” It now has almost 500 members."
19801,"He takes the virus seriously, he said, and knows that it can be particularly deadly for older people."
19802,"But he does not believe that lockdowns are the way to handle it, calling them “feel-good” measures that do more harm than good."
19803,He was also doubtful that the recent spike in Arizona coronavirus numbers was something to be overly concerned about.
19804,"“I think people are going about their life a little bit more, and that’s probably why the spike happened,” he said, adding, “I’m an absolute believer that we need to develop herd immunity.”

19809,Pretty awesome development in Germany.
19810,"After summer break, we opened schools again in September becuase the pressure on politicians was high."
19811,"They claimed that infections in schools are low and those are not the places where ""superspreading"" takes place."
19812,But why would a virus just levitate around younger people?
19813,"When at the same time, we already knew that infants/young adults rarely develop symptoms?"
19814,It was pretty obvious at that point that the rate of asymptomatic carrieres was / is immense in that age stratum.
19815,"And that those, sick but obviously in perfect health, individuals would spread the viruses home to the families."
19816,I personally know one case where the kids brought home the virus from kindergarden.
19817,Yet they tested questioned whether it might be corona or not as if it's common that all children and all families become sick so quickly.
19818,We had all the pieces of the puzzle but somehow people did not manage to combine the simplest picture.
19819,Probably because it was a conclusion that hurt.
19820,"&amp;#x200B;

We acted too weak during the beginning, where one hurtful lockdown could have (probably) ended this."
19821,The measurements now need to be more and more and more restrictive.
19822,"Sorry, im not very in tune with covid news."
19823,So i heard my mom say that biden said that it would probably take years for the majority of people to get the covid vaccine?
19824,Is this true?
19825,Or is he speaking on the fact that he knows not a lot of people will trust the vaccine and it may take awhile to get people to actually take it?
19826,If its not the latter im kind of scared.
19827,I at least just want things to at least go semi normal.
19828,Especially with a mom like mine.
19829,She forces me to wear a mask soon as i step outside which im fine with but its usually even when nobody is around and even when we’re in a car.
19830,"Plus its just impossible to do anything like get a job, see friends, etc."
19831,"and chances are they might be making us go back to school soon in person and seeing as how some of my classmates and friends already got covid or dont care about protecting themselves against it, im scared."
19832,Please tell me this will be over SOON
19833,if one assumes everyone could be infected including themselves the same result could be achieved.
19834,I suspect those that don't care won't care enough to test themselves either so it won't make much if any difference.
19835,Too bad Trump's only talents are running businesses into the ground and making other peoples' lives worse
19836,As I nursing home employee who just learned only 40% of my coworkers received the vaccine that was given at work by CVS I think these assholes might help improve our vaccination rates.
19837,"Brits: ""are we the baddies now?"""

19841,Well that is the estimate.

19843,"And in some states I understand, like NY, providers could be fined hundreds of thousands of dollars for doing this exact thing."
19844,"Oof, I'm sorry."
19845,My friends in Texas tell me it's bad there.
19846,"Have a link: https://www.dshs.texas.gov/coronavirus/business.aspx

Hopefully you can find some way to force them to close."
19847,go eat your haggis you miserable covid bag
19848,"Mad max really gonna happen, but it is only in America"
19849,"Wait, if jury trials are suspended then what about people who were falsely arrested?"
19850,Does their freedom solely depend on the opinion of the judge?
19851,"I wouldn’t say awful, maybe not my cup of tea."
19852,And most definitely not my most trusted source of healthcare information and perhaps unqualified as a science writer.
19853,"As much as I advocate opening schools, the UK variant of Covid effects kids more than before."
19854,We’ll see if that’s true I guess.
19855,&gt; But implies preventing 95% of all symptomatic cases.
19856,"I've never heard that, it's not my understanding, AFAIK it's never been stated."
19857,Therefore the implication may just be a misinterpretation on someone's part.

19864,We’re outside all year.
19865,"Hiking, skiing, surfing still popular in rainy weather."
19866,This part is actually common practice in most places before COVID hit.
19867,"“If the patient has no signs of breathing or a pulse, EMS will try to resuscitate the patient for at least 20 minutes, the memo said."
19868,"If the patient is stabilized during that time, they would then be taken to a hospital."
19869,"But if the patient is declared dead at the scene or no pulse can be restored, paramedics will not take the patient to the hospital.”"
19870,"NZ however is easier to control the pandemic , as it is mainly a remote island with low population density."
19871,There is no way to seal for example NYC or other major European cities the way NZ did.
19872,For Example i'm sure that Iceland or Greenland (a bit exaggerated examples) also did excelant.

19899,"TL;DR

&gt;Pratt was infected with the coronavirus, having tested positive the previous week."
19900,"&gt;The defendant had been unaware of his test result, but Brazos County jail officials knew."
19901,"Pratt should never have been allowed to leave an isolated cell, let alone been taken to the courthouse in a county vehicle while seated next to another defendant who then sat in another courtroom all day."

19913,They say the variant is 50% or more effective at transmission and they say its been around for many months.
19914,If that is the case we should assume its in most countries.
19915,Yes.
19916,You are correct.
19917,They approved two rapid tests.
19918,One needs a $40/$50 machine and a prescription and the other I believe is the colored lines and costs $25 -$30.
19919,Michael Mina has been talking about rapid saliva tests that cost $19.99 for a box of 30 tests.
19920,I like these because they are cheap enough for most people to purchase and use frequently.
19921,Let’s say an essential worker at the grocery store...he / she can test themselves everyday.
19922,Or a small business or restaurant owner can test their entire staff.
19923,"If they are positive they go home , if negative they can stay and work."
19924,I imagine the holdup is in reporting and collecting the data as well as privacy issues.
19925,I follow Michael Mina on twitter and he has really sold me on the idea of the rapid tests as way to control the virus.
19926,I always thought attenuated is live virus but crippled?
19927,This seems to be dead virus?
19928,Zhang Zhan was arrested in regards to two claims she made regarding the early Wuhan lockdown.
19929,First that people had to pay for their COVID tests and secondly that people stuck in their homes were being sent rotten vegetables.
19930,The Chinese gov says those are lies and she maintains they are true.
19931,If her claims are true and she is being arrested to cover up an embarrassing story it still has hardly anything to do with the larger COVID response and nothing to do with the genesis of the virus.
19932,Yes it’s odd.
19933,"My roommate is a traveling nurse and she moved from NY to CA in March, jobless."

19936,untill your rich and get swindled
19937,I can get a quick test for little to nothing.
19938,They did speed it up a bit (but not before there was outrage about the slow process) and we will continue to do so.
19939,"Yes they failed hard with this at first, but I truly think that once the vaccination train really gets going it will go quite smooth."

you can not just put a vaccine and let that person go."
19944,"In India, a person has to Stay 45 min In the hospital after taking a vaccine."
19945,This is to make sure that he does not have any allergic reactions after taking it.
19946,SO it's only being done in the outdoor clinic of hospitals.

19959,"Switzerland is supposed to have a pretty neat tracking app, with a focus on privacy, not sure what became of it."
19960,That’s not what he’s doing.
19961,He’s trying to make it a crime to give the vaccine to people who aren’t in the prioritization group.
19962,"Which sounds good in theory, but it means that if vaccines are ever close to going bad, and no one in those groups is around, it will have to go to waste, rather than in go to someone else, unless the DR feels like going to jail or paying a fine."
19963,His suggested policy makes it more likely that a vaccine would be wasted or get thrown out.
19964,We all expected them to transparent and forthright because the country couldn't possibly have something to hide.

19968,Today my boyfriend's father returned from a trip to New Orleans and wants us to meet up with him.
19969,He traveled via plane and stayed at a casino hotel.

19971,"Yesterday my boss let myself and my coworker know that he may be going home early because last night he had all the symptoms of ""the vid"" but came in to work anyway because he was feeling fineish in the morning."
19972,Thank gosh we were all wearing masks but STILL.
19973,This is not the first time my boss has had covid symptoms and come to work anyway because he thought it was something else.
19974,I've gotten tested for covid at least 3 or 4 times.
19975,"None positive yet, but as I've been going to work since May I've been careful."
19976,I find it really hard to fathom that most of my coworkers have never gotten a covid test.
19977,I seriously doubt that in almost a year they have had none of the typical covid symptoms.
19978,I feel like I am the only one taking the virus seriously and even though I'm grateful to have a job I'm now scared (again) that I caught covid from someone who came to work when they shouldn't have.
19979,We have very clear health and safety rules where I'm at so it's really frustrating to have upper management violate them.
19980,"I want the vaccine so bad, but I'm in my early 20s so I have no idea when I'm going to be able to get it."
19981,The news of mutations is really scaring me.
19982,Even if I'm technically more likely to overcome the virus than someone else I don't want to be flippant with my life.
19983,"The article only states they are planning to sequence the 2 million tests, it doesn't say anything about results."
19984,If accurate though that would indicate the proportion of s-dropout cases doubled over 4 times in those 2 months so another month could mean it is much much more than 5%.
19985,Even at 5% of cases in December that's easily hundreds of thousands.
19986,It is difficult to say though as the US does not sequence a large number of their cases.
19987,It wouldn't be noticable in the numbers in the early stages of exponential growth but could still be spreading rapidly.
19988,Yeah.
19989,Texas specifically
19990,Well hopefully you are right

Seriously though I agree it would be nice to know who did the bad stuff."
19997,The problem is in the getting there.
19998,"And maybe privacy laws, if people care about that stuff."
19999,"If the person did nothing illegal, the law might protect them."
20000,"I’m sorry, but what’s wrong with this?"
20001,We need as many people to get vaccinated as possible and he’s making it a big deal to frivolously throw away desperately needed doses.
20002,The federal government has abandoned the effort and now states have to step up and figure it out.
20003,I’m honestly curious why you said this.
20004,Do you truly think this is a bad thing?

20024,They can't ever even get close to the 15+ l/min those patients need.
20025,Like you need to combine several to even get to 15.
20026,And some of those patients will be on 60l/min.
20027,It's crazy.
20028,"Like they'll have to start rotating oxygen cylinders, because it's the actual piping that doesn't support this much combined flow."
20029,Simply notade to supply enough oxygen when half the taps in the hospital are wide open.
20030,[removed]
20031,"The virus does not ""live"" outside the host cell so they can not be studied."
20032,So you need to prepare a solution that exactly replicates condition of a living cell to keep them alive in the lab.
20033,You can not use live-cell as virus tends to mix their DNA with other cell and mutate.
20034,Old solution of covid mutated covid v2 so no one was able to study it properly till now.
20035,Doing the math.
20036,"If $1300 is the average American rent.....

20045,"So , it’s not surprising that they have to do what they gotta do to make ends meet and not shut down."

20047,More than likely the people that would buy this have a convenient way of dropping it off for shipment ...
20048,Either at their office or a dropbox location or handing it to their assistant if you know what I mean.
20049,The FDA has approved some rapid tests although I think you still need a prescription.
20050,IIRC there's one for $25-$30 that just makes colored lines you can self read.

20097,Well you can’t immediately have a lockdown.
20098,Authorities give a couple days or a week notice for people to prepare for it so there’s no panic.
20099,Obviate means to make unnecessary.
20100,I don’t understand how the appearance of a second strain makes a vaccine for a first strain unnecessary.
20101,A better usage would be: “the death of every single human within the continental 48 states obviated the need for a faster vaccine rollout.”

20135,Didn't they allow one team in when this was first breaking out?
20136,So what is there to hide now?
20137,The reason we need to get the front liners first I especially healthcare is because that keeps them working if they get exposed.
20138,One of the issues we had here in November is that too many workers were out there was limited staffing.
20139,At times we had hospitals with 300-400 out because they were exposed.
20140,I imagine that guidance will change after full vaccination.
20141,My state is vaccinating them in tandem.
20142,Nursing homes and Medicare.
20143,nursing homes are nearly 70% of deaths.
20144,Starting in Feb it will be 75+ and another group.
20145,So I imagine by mid May we should see a decline in hospitalizations and deaths.

20182,I’m on jury duty now 🤞
20183,I think at this point the discussion should shift from “should we open/close schools” and move to “how can we get teachers vaccinated ASAP.” That’s really the only way to reopen schools in a way that does not involve massive illness or death.
20184,And turn off all the trash compactors on the detention level!
20185,That’s a big reason why expecting masks to magically fix everything is dumb.
20186,Masks help reduce direct transmission but people seem to think if everyone just wears a mask there won’t be any Covid

20209,Ugh..  Me and my SO are currently trying to recover from covid and isolating after someone at my SO's work basically became a super spreader at work infecting almost 80 percent of the workplace.
20210,The employee who everyone believes was the spreader at his work just spent 6 days in the ICU and is now only able to function while on oxygen and will need intensive lung type rehab we found out today.
20211,This is not good.
20212,I agree with your statement.
20213,My allergist has actually advised me not to get the vaccine yet because I have severe allergies.
20214,"You name it I am probably allergic to it, aside from tree nuts."
20215,I also have food allergies.
20216,He said that in order for me to get it I'd have to either be at the office with epi in hand and neb close by or be at the hospital where I can immediate medical attention if need be.
20217,"Now I know ""IF"" is a small chance but still a very high risk for me as I get anaphylaxis rather easy."
20218,I cannot even get the shot at my allergist right now because they don't offer it.
20219,I do work in healthcare as a Medical Assistant in a primary care setting.
20220,I do have mixed feelings about this vaccine as the campaign to create this vaccine was called operation warp speed.
20221,I don't even like the flu vaccine.
20222,Did a lot of research in college and learned that the flu is constantly mutating which is why they play a guessing game every year on what strain will be active.
20223,"I read somewhere the other day that COVID-19 has mutated 28 times within the past year, making it less severe but more contagious due to the spike from the virus that hooks onto our cells."
20224,My question is.
20225,If it has mutated 28 times already does that mean this vaccine will have to be every year and do s that mean they're constantly going to be playing a guessing game on which mutation will be active?
20226,Just food for thought.
20227,"Now I'm not saying I WON'T GET IT AT ALL, but after more studies have been done and I've seen how the vaccine works on the population then I'll make my decision."
20228,Until then I'll just do the best I can do from infection prevention.
20229,In California you should be able to defer it for one year with no reason given.
20230,In my country (Alameda) you can long it the court website and defer to a specified week in the future.
20231,And at that date they may choose not to call you again.

20598,Recombination events complicate this (simultaneous infection of two variants in a cell can result in hybrid variants).
20599,"Also, growing immunity to one variant or family of variants (both from natural immunity and vaccination) means that if a different variant family can better avoid existing immunity, it will eventually become dominant, at least relative to the variant the population has a good deal of immunity to."

20608,&gt;You may say its parroting but that is because its one theory explaining virulence and spread based on evolution and selection.
20609,"No, it isn't really an accepted fact as you are making it out."
20610,"there is a general tendency to evolve to be less lethal over time, but that says fuckall about what that means generation to generation as far as selection goes."
20611,"&gt;A commonly stated idea is that there is often an evolutionary trade-off between virulence and transmissibility because intra-host virus replication is necessary to facilitate inter-host transmission but may also lead to disease, and it is impossible for natural selection to optimize all traits simultaneously."
20612,"In the case of MYXV, this trade-off is thought to lead to ‘intermediate’ virulence grades being selectively advantageous: higher virulence may mean that the rabbit host dies before inter-host transmission, whereas lower virulence is selected against because it does not increase virus transmission rates."
20613,A similar trade-off model has been proposed to explain the evolution of HIV virulence40.
20614,"However, many doubts have been raised about the general applicability of the trade-off model35,41,42,43, virus fitness will be affected by traits other than virulence and transmissibility39,41,44, contrary results have been observed in experimental studies45 and relatively little is known about evolutionary trade-offs in nature."
20615,"For example, in the case of the second virus released as a biocontrol against European rabbits in Australia — rabbit haemorrhagic disease virus (RHDV) — there is evidence that virulence has increased through time, probably because virus transmission often occurs through blow flies that feed on animal carcasses, making host death selectively favourable46."
20616,"Similarly, experimental studies of plant RNA viruses have shown that high virulence does not necessarily impede host adaptation47 and, in the case of malaria, higher virulence was shown to provide the Plasmodium parasites with a competitive advantage within hosts48."

20659,“We can tweak the vaccine in 6 weeks” doesn’t sound very promising considering the FDA loves to take their sweet time and we’d have to vaccinate everybody again.

20708,"There are two ways to interpret this:

1. mRNA vaccine delivery has been discussed, modeled, and experimented with for two decades so we must know a lot about it by now, which speaks to its safety long-term."

20737,Why are you spamming this everywhere?
20738,What's your agenda?
20739,I suspect a lot of people calling for lockdowns have not experienced it or are able to afford it and be comfortable.
20740,I have 2 kids right now sitting in front of screens in lockdown “learning”.
20741,It’s obvious to them and me that they are not getting nearly enough mental or physical stimulation.
20742,"This is the Thanksgiving wave, wait til the Christmas/ new years eve wave."
20743,So close the schools.
20744,"While the children may not get be very ill, they are still being infected and passing it on at an alarming rate, as can be seen by the fact that teachers are testing positive at 3.3X the normal rate."
20745,"Just because they're not dying, doesn't mean they're not driving mutations."
20746,Single dose would be great!
20747,I have a feeling when the general population starts getting the two-part vaccine that we’re gonna see a lot of folks wasting their first dose by not getting the second one in time.
20748,Bet it’s one of the new strains
20749,Friendly ICU nurse here: I even mask up at home and try to social distance because I’m exposed nearly daily.
20750,Just backing up your point.
20751,"Waiting for mine, so I can start getting treatment for some medcal issues without as much risk."
20752,Grocery runs will still be at 7 AM with mask and goggles until the case count is way down.
20753,I just hope we can get it killed off before it mutates into something more deadly and unaffected by the vaccine.
20754,I think this **is** great news!

20764,What good is that if these beds cannot be staffed by the appropriate professionals?
20765,And how would you like your non-COVID emergency treated?
20766,You want your ICU bed staffed by a first year RN?
20767,Seriously think about it.
20768,"I’ll use this last example with physicians, because everyone glorifies doctors (though hospitals exist for nursing care)."

20799,I dont know why you are being down voted.
20800,Congratulations on losing the weight.

20802,They don't want to take responsibility though.
20803,"They would rather live a less life than they deserve and be a burden on their families, communities and government."
20804,My mom is terrified of the virus not leaving her home or letting anyone in but continues to eat crap barely move around and be overweight.
20805,Her lifestyle and diet are going to kill her prematurely for sure but I guess she doesn't care about that.
20806,I just don't understand if you are so terrified of dying from the virus why not increase your chances of survival by losing weight?
20807,Most people just don't want to put in the effort and live a subpar shorter life.
20808,Such a waste of what could be.
20809,Again Congratulations to you and keep it up.
20810,Hopefully you can inspire others.
20811,"The problem is that the ""UK"" variant could have come from anywhere, possibly France due to the prevalence in Kent, and has already been detected in 41 countries."
20812,Borders should be closed for non-essential travel and everyone travelling internationally (or at all) should be tested.
20813,Other than restricting direct flights from South Africa (currently) and Denmark (for a short period previously) the UK is almost unique in allowing all foreign travellers to arrive here throughout the pandemic.
20814,Someone should be fired over the image chosen for this news.
20815,"Can we just call this one Covid-20, great way to honour 2020 if you ask me"
20816,&gt; Not really.
20817,"Yes, really."
20818,This is pretty basic maths.
20819,"If you take the current rate of deaths - call it 100/day to make it easy, on 10k people infected (1% death rate - again, for convenience)."
20820,Infections double (20k) but 1/3 (your number) of deaths are prevented by the vaccine you end up with deaths at 133/day and ICUs remain just as full.
20821,My point is it's more simple than you're making it out to be.
20822,"Whether ICU numbers drop is not only down to the number of vaccines delivered, at this stage."
20823,"&gt; After you've vaccinated everyone above the age of 65 (which will be soon)

20838,"If Covid was seen as an airborne disease, I feel like more precautions would have been enforced."

20843,What about the ones who work in a hospital?
20844,It's not farfetched at all.
20845,We've done similar research that creates new viruses in the US but it's now banned due to concerns of deadly uncontrollable viruses accidentally leaking.

20849,Is it wrong that I don’t mind a few rich people cutting the line if it means it gets out faster?
20850,"Obviously if they were completely hogging them like Stanford did preventing medical residents on the front line from getting the vaccine that would be one thing, but if 1-2% going to the extremely rich means we give out several more thousand to the people that need it per day, then that is a fair price to going faster and reaching more of the people that need it sooner."
20851,"I mean, right now there are over 10 million doses in the US prepared and ready but unused."
20852,We can definitely be handing this out faster.
20853,Treatment such as polyclonal antibody treatment?
20854,"Cuomo has revealed himself to be a bit of a putz as of late, but at least he came out and basically said that if the sites in NY that were given vaccines don't pick up the pace immediately, they can basically stuff it."
20855,Good call.

We know with almost 100% certainty that the virus originated in China."

20884,"Thinking and don't get to select their strain, it's a matter."
20885,Of natural selection.
20886,"Typically, greater."
20887,Lethality correlates with less transmissibility which limitates propagation.
20888,Greater transmissibility typically.
20889,"Correlates with less lethality because, well, you need to.move around to transmit a virus."
20890,However sars-cov-2 is part of that class of virus that is transmissible before the onset of symptoms.
20891,There is no need for a trade-off.
20892,"Between lethality and transmissibility, since someone can be highly contagious before they even get sick."
20893,"If the virus becomes more lethal, then it still won't affect transmissibility."
20894,"Yes, the first 4 weeks will be slower because if you ran at max capacity from day one, starting week 5, you are going to have those who need their second shot SOL because there's no extra capacity."
20895,"However if the capacity is 1 million shots per day, that means that if you want to deliver vaccines to 250 million people that means you have to deliver 500 million injections."
20896,500 million shots / 1 million capacity = 500 days.
20897,"If you want to reach that goal of say 250 million people in six months, you have to deliver 500mil/180 days, you need to deliver 2.77mil a day."

20999,I’m so sick of Duceys lack of action (beyond paying for heaters for restaurant outdoor seating that is).
21000,"All counties are currently recommended virtual (even with them changing the metrics with no warning last year), and all should be."
21001,AZ is one of the worst states as far as infection rate and control so the fact that any schools are open is ridiculous.
21002,Nut butter lolol
21003,40% is too low!
21004,"&gt;&gt;What we found was that the very small blood vessels in the brain were leaking,"" Nath says."
21005,"""And it wasn't evenly — you would find a small blood vessel here and a small blood vessel there."""
21006,"&gt;&gt;The injuries resembled those from a series of tiny strokes occurring in many different areas of the brain, Nath says."
21007,"&gt;&gt;The finding may explain why COVID-19 patients have such a wide range of brain-related symptoms, Nath says, including some related to brain areas that control functions such as heart rate, breathing and blood pressure."
21008,"&gt;&gt;”They complain of heart racing,"" he says, or that ""when they stand up they get quite dizzy."
21009,"Or they can have urinary problems."""
21010,"&gt;&gt;Still others report feeling extreme fatigue, which can also be caused by a brain injury."
21011,"&gt;&gt;What's more, the inflammation and leaky blood vessels associated with all these symptoms may make a person's brain more vulnerable to another type of damage."
21012,"&gt;&gt;”We know that those are important in Alzheimer's disease and we're seeing them play a key role here in COVID-19,"" says Heather Snyder, vice president of medical and scientific operations at the Alzheimer's Association."
21013,"""And what that may mean in later life, we need to be asking that question now."""
21014,"We really can’t catch a break with this thing, can we?"
21015,I mean what can’t this virus do at this point?
21016,"I never thought I’d live through 9/11, the Green Recession, our next Great Recession, and the end of the world either by virus, mother nature, or a nuclear bomb from the world going crazy."
21017,"I haven’t heard that the vaccine is being hoarded, can you point me towards those news sources?"
21018,"Also, please don’t encourage people to start breaking vaccine freezers."
21019,That means we won’t have the ability to store the vaccine and we won’t be able to prioritize those who have had the first short and need their second shot to complete the vaccine schedule.
21020,It would also lead to riots as people clamor to be the first in line to get it within a very small time frame if we can’t store the vaccine properly.
21021,"So far, the feds are doing much better getting vaccinations to provinces than provinces are doing getting them into arms."
21022,"Until that changes, welcome to federalism."
21023,How long to mass produce and distribute?
21024,My understanding is that they started producing the current one months ago.
21025,It’s not unconstitutional to suspend jury trials temporarily.
21026,Many states did.

21037,"This is one of the most desired commodities on the planet right now, and they'd been sitting on it for at least a day."
21038,They didn't even check the freezer until almost noon.
21039,"The county had unvaccinated first responders, jail staff, and nursing home residents - and a hospital with hundreds of doses that they apparently didn't intend on using that day."
21040,Why are they not treating all of their doses as if distributing them is an emergency?
21041,Doesn't seem to make any sense though.

21043,"Yeah, that’s not good enough."

21050,Tldr i fucked up with loose translation of medical terms
21051,I was just called for jury duty for the entire month of January.
21052,I obviously postponed as there are massive spikes everywhere in our area and really everywhere right now.

21057,"They went on strike in 2019, they said back then teachers would make a little under $60k (starting salary), and teachers with a PhD would make six-figures."

21061,&gt;1918 flu wasn’t the result of a single strain mutating to a more lethal form.
21062,"Yeah, the flu does have antigenic shift, still it mutated and became more lethal and you used as an example of the opposite, pretty funny."
21063,as to your certitude that mutations cause viruses to be less virulent as a general rule.
21064,"&gt;A commonly stated idea is that there is often an evolutionary trade-off between virulence and transmissibility because intra-host virus replication is necessary to facilitate inter-host transmission but may also lead to disease, and it is impossible for natural selection to optimize all traits simultaneously."
21065,"In the case of MYXV, this trade-off is thought to lead to ‘intermediate’ virulence grades being selectively advantageous: higher virulence may mean that the rabbit host dies before inter-host transmission, whereas lower virulence is selected against because it does not increase virus transmission rates."
21066,A similar trade-off model has been proposed to explain the evolution of HIV virulence40.
21067,"However, many doubts have been raised about the general applicability of the trade-off model35,41,42,43, virus fitness will be affected by traits other than virulence and transmissibility39,41,44, contrary results have been observed in experimental studies45 and relatively little is known about evolutionary trade-offs in nature."
21068,"For example, in the case of the second virus released as a biocontrol against European rabbits in Australia — rabbit haemorrhagic disease virus (RHDV) — there is evidence that virulence has increased through time, probably because virus transmission often occurs through blow flies that feed on animal carcasses, making host death selectively favourable46."
21069,"Similarly, experimental studies of plant RNA viruses have shown that high virulence does not necessarily impede host adaptation47 and, in the case of malaria, higher virulence was shown to provide the Plasmodium parasites with a competitive advantage within hosts48."
21070,"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41576-018-0055-5

or to put this another way

&gt;Odds are though most viruses mutate to less lethal forms of themselves."
21071,"You can't prove this any more than you could the 99 percent, but please do try."
21072,[removed]
21073,The trouble is when you have more than one species as a host.
21074,A virus can be super deadly in humans as long as it’s not too bad in an animal host (take Ebola for example).
21075,That’s why it’s super fucking bad news that we have SARS-COV-2 infected mink getting into the wild.
21076,Something that’s harmless for them may eventually jump into humans in the future and fuck shit up the same way that SARS-COV-2 jumped into humans from a bat.

21078,"I know this will be downvoted, but there is a legitimate ethical case for believing that *some* teachers should teach."
21079,"I say this as someone who taught undergraduates in person all Fall as a PhD student and is in the clinic now as a med student (MD/PhD program, if that seems weird)."
21080,"For most demographics, the risks are extremely low."
21081,"For many of the kids, especially those from low-income or disruptive households, a year of distance learning could set them back for life."
21082,"As someone who taught college students via distance learning, I can tell you that while some students manage, many others struggle with the format to the point of it being practically useless."
21083,I can only imagine the effect it has on K-12.
21084,"If you just consider mortality risk, the risk of death for a teacher in the 45-55 range who catches COVID is about the same as the risk of death from any other cause in a year, about ~0.2-0.3%."
21085,So catching COVID basically doubles your chance of death that year.
21086,"However, teachers are not guaranteed to get COVID if they go to work."
21087,They're also not guaranteed to avoid it if they stay home.
21088,We can quantify this with a risk ratio.
21089,Let's assume about 25% of the US gets COVID between now and the end.
21090,"Let's assume teaching has a risk ratio of 2 (so teachers are 2x more likely to catch COVID if they are teaching, this is about what other essential workers experience, but below the risk to healthcare workers)."
21091,"The actual increased risk of death to 45-55 year old teachers, from teaching, would be 0.1-0.25%, about half the risk of normal death in a year from all other causes."
21092,"The same analysis applied to other age groups

25-35: ~0.01%

35-45: ~0.035%

55-65: ~0.4%

At each age, the risk is close to one half the risk incurred during ordinary, pre-COVID life."
21093,This changes from vanishingly small in younger demographics to very significant in older demographics.
21094,"Normally I'd scoff at asking anyone to increase their risk of death for a job, but consider that we're asking *everyone* to do the same."
21095,Denying a child education increase his/her risk of death in the future by similar if not a greater amount.
21096,Asking a small business owner to close increases his/her risk of death through socioeconomic factors.
21097,Asking a single mother to juggle kids at home and a job stifles the economy and transfers even more of this financial risk onto the rest of society.
21098,"It's indirect, but it's real."
21099,"Financial, educational, and mental health deficits kill people very quantifiably."
21100,Of course there is the risk of non-fatal injury.
21101,"This is much higher, but so is your basal risk of non-fatal injury."
21102,You're far more likely to have permanent back problems from a car crash than to die in one.
21103,COVID scales similarly.
21104,The point?
21105,"Life is full of risk, and the relative risk of occupational COVID is actually very small."
21106,The risk to the teacher is probably far outweighed by the incurred risk of negative life outcomes by kids and parents.
21107,"It's just that no one is quantifying that risk for you explicitly, and the consequences may take years or decades to manifest in full."
21108,"Of course if teachers are going into work, vaccines should be prioritized for them and sent as quickly as possible."
21109,They should be provided with N95 masks (and face shields if they wish).
21110,"However, I do believe those who are low risk should teach."
21111,"The decline of humanity will have less to do with a virus that primarily kills people age 40+, but instead due to people realizing that we have decoupled fornication with pregnancy and chose more of the former and less of the latter."
21112,COVID has been spreading unabated for a year.
21113,"We only know of a the so-called ""UK"" and ""SA"" variants because of sporadic testing."
21114,"We have no idea of the variants that exist that we haven't tested for, primarily in the US where we've had rampant spread without adequate testing."
21115,I'm not even going to get into a point/counterpoint argument over this.
21116,It's not worth debating.
21117,"COVID should now be considered a permanent virus the human population will have to contend with and anything about the ramifications of that reality, good or bad, is speculation and not worth digging one's heels into any particular perspective."
21118,Dude kids these days social interact online lmao
21119,Can you even truly call it a lockdown if there is no actual lockdown?
21120,Texas - doing it’s best to catch Florida.

21181,I and probably some others explained it in this thread over like 5 paragraphs.

21210,My worry is how fast the spike protein's of this virus is mutating and finding ways around the antibodies in the system.
21211,What has mutated in this short period of time most of the time does not happen for a generation of the virus life span (that was hard to word right so sorry if it does not sound right).
21212,"Will the next mutation be the one that forms spike protein's that will completely make the vaccine no good that I am not sure of, but it is a good chance really soon it will mutate in a way to get around the protection."

21221,"(Most recent change to this is a ban from large events)

The logic behind this is that false negatives are a thing; but 14 days after infection it is unlikely to be contagious if asymptomatic (you get tested again if you show symptoms)

And you get compensation too, unless you deliberately went looking for trouble (went sightseeing abroad in the middle of a pandemic)"

21232,&gt; You don't understand how a virus works if you think this is what is going to happen.
21233,Viruses mutate all the time and 99% they become less deadly over time.
21234,"Viruses mutate all the time, but normally there is a single mutation in a host."
21235,These small mutations often cancel each other out.
21236,They are not enough to make a virus more or less deadly.
21237,That is not what we are talking about here.
21238,Here we are talking of new variants in which more than ten mutations occurred in a single host.
21239,That changed the property of the virus.
21240,It became more transmissible.
21241,"The more the virus spreads, the higher the chances it'll mutate even more."
21242,"With the current exponential growth, new variants are guaranteed."
21243,Viruses may become less fatal if that allows them to reproduce better.
21244,A virus in a dead host can't reproduce.
21245,"However, that is not the case with SARS-CoV-2."
21246,This virus is already very good at reproducing.
21247,"Moreover, it reproduces in the 1st two weeks when it is most contagious, but patients only die after 3 to 4 weeks."
21248,"In other words, whether a patient dies or not has no influence on the virus' reproduction."
21249,There is no evolutionary pressure for the virus to become less fatal.
21250,It could even become more fatal as the Spanish flu in the 2nd wave.
21251,There is an interesting article from NYMag covering how this virus may have escaped from a lab.
21252,"https://nymag.com/intelligencer/article/coronavirus-lab-escape-theory.html?utm_source=tw&amp;utm_medium=s1&amp;utm_campaign=nym

The key thing to keep in mind is that if it did come from a lab, it was likely accidental."
21253,There are certainly people who are looking to blame China and say they released it on purpose in order to score xenophobic political points.
21254,"But the U.S. has been funding research into these coronaviruses, changing them and such for research, and it could have simply gotten out of the lab."
21255,This wouldn't be the first time this has happened.
21256,Any chance you still have that study?
21257,Oh.

21269,What is the point of this statistically?
21270,Drunk driving deaths eclipse these numbers.
21271,WTF!
21272,Why are these scare mongering articles even getting attention?!
21273,"I hate when I see our Veterans being used, like prostitutes, for the government fear merchants."
21274,"my bad, i just realized the headline says ""healthy""."
21275,"you're right, morbidly obese is very common but definitely not healthy"
21276,Can anyone who had Covid comment on how long it took for your sense of smell and taste to return?
21277,I am on day 4 after testing positive for Covid and the traditional flu and am experiencing some moderate symptoms but the loss of taste and smell is making me not even want to eat anything.
21278,"So, what happened?"
21279,Are they fired?
21280,[removed]
21281,Except I don't care what other vaccines or viruses do.
21282,I care about what COVID does.
21283,"Right now they don't have enough evidence either way, and would rather not hedge my bets on a ""maybe""."
21284,An average salary of 34K.
21285,Ranked 19th in the nation.
21286,US ranked 27th in the world.
21287,How dare they not show up!
21288,/s
21289,The good news is that viruses usually evolve to be more transmissible and less lethal.
21290,A dead host isn't very efficient in transmitting the virus to others
21291,I actually like the idea of paying people to get vaccinated.
21292,"The benefits of vaccines are experienced by the entire community, not just the one vaccinated."
21293,I think it's fair to provide monetary incentives.
21294,"If we paid people $10 (and covered the cost of administering it) to get a flu shot, we would have much higher vaccination rates IMO."
21295,"Many countries ""paid people to stay home"" by adding direct payments to citizens during lockdowns."
21296,That's another situation where civic duty and monetary compensation were one and the same
21297,Oh I’m buckled!!
21298,Covid fish taco edition!

21300,Are people there very concerned with the quality of their masks?
21301,"&amp;#x200B;

I ask because to me it seems a lot of time and energy is wasted here in the West on arguing about what is the best possible mask, where is the scientific proof for the superiority of the mask, etc."
21302,People here seem to think a mask is useless or dangerous if it does not provide 100% protection from the virus to the person wearing it.
21303,"When I see pictures from Asian countries where everyone has a mask, they're mostly wearing various fabric masks, some of which look homemade."
21304,Honestly it prob depends on each state I bet Florida and Texas are much earlier then Cali and New York
21305,"Definitely true... although she's a few weeks into her first dose, so she should have a large percentage of the immunity she'll eventually have."
21306,So how effective really is the vaccine?
21307,"Are people really safe after getting it, even if we don’t have like 80% of the population vaccinated as well?"
21308,This.
21309,"I’m a hygienist, in my state I can give local anesthesia shots (as long as the dentist is in the office)."
21310,Those are kinda tricky shots as you have to get them in the right spot and the right amount and kind of anesthetics.
21311,"Vs these shots which, within brand, are all the same and probably could be mixed and drawn up by the Dr or Pharmacist so shot administrators just have to grab and jab."
21312,I bet people like me could be easily retrained in an afternoon to give the shot with a Dr nearby.
21313,"People like my partner, who isn’t a pro, but has acted as my assistant at charity events  doing things like patient education and translation could also volunteer to give people their aftercare info and set up their second shot appointment etc."
21314,"Vax and train people like me and I’d be delighted to do it, especially if I got paid a fair wage."
21315,"I get yearly flu vaccines, just shoot up both my arms up I guess"
21316,Can I ask which state?
21317,just curious if that shitty grade policy is state based or district based.
21318,either way super unfair to the families that wanted remote.
21319,What do you mean?
21320,Had anything in an advertisement every actually been instant?
21321,His mom would have been on her knees.
21322,Go to work.

21333,&gt;'The virus' isn't a huge entity with one genetic code that mutates all at once.
21334,I didn't say that is was OR that it did.
21335,"Yeah, I've been shit on more times than not here by stating just that."
21336,They currently don't know.
21337,They don't have enough data or evidence either way.
21338,Too many wishful thinking makes reality advocates here.
21339,[removed]
21340,Keep wearing masks?
21341,"Yeah, I hate that ""at risk"" is used to refer to those most likely to catch it and those most likely to develop serious complications or die from it."
21342,It makes conversations like this confusing.
21343,"I actually did not know about fire departments ability to levy fines, I assumed that a secondary body would be responsible for that."
21344,Thanks for educating me!
21345,[removed]
21346,If my hospital would let me I would be happy to put vaccines in arms all day without rest  but they don’t just let us march into the pharmacy and start distributing vaccine.
21347,You have a poor understanding of medical operations and a cruel nature.
21348,I believe the word he's searching for is 'RESPONSIBLE'.
21349,Looking to pass the buck for his incompetence.
21350,Look what happened to the Spanish Flu.
21351,A year later?
21352,WHO cares now?
21353,Anything that would compromise China is gone already.

21356,They don't know (yet).
21357,I'd rather not bet on maybe.
21358,"According to these redditors, it's all on Newsom"
21359,Vaccinating medical care workers first is hardly virtue signaling.
21360,"Even other countries that are taking the approach you are recommending (based on age) still have medical workers mentioned specifically as being high in priority because while we may vaccinating all these other people, we still need medical workers to handle COVId cases that might come in from unvaccinated groups, and then there's the fact that they are not simply going to be dealing with COVID patients but may have to provide care to someone who was in a car accident."
21361,[removed]
21362,This exactly.
21363,They believe even a vaccinated person can shed enough virus load to cause infection in others.
21364,Just stick it in my arm please.
21365,Or my neighbors arm.
21366,Anybody’s arm.
21367,Just drive down vectors.
21368,It’s better than nothing.
21369,Yeah I refused hour duty this year because of something just like this.
21370,I knew they couldn’t guarantee my safety.
21371,So I refused to go in.
21372,"I'm not saying I'm one of those people, all I do is go to work and then go home so you can !"
21373,@#$ off.
21374,I work in a shopping plaza and ever since the holidays it's like people have forgotten there's a deadly pandemic spreading around.
21375,Parking lot and stores are always packed so you take your statistics and shove em where the sun don't shine.
21376,Look at how it’s going.
21377,I’d say the virus has been pretty successful.
21378,China doesn’t do the “it didn’t come from the lab” argument any favors.
21379,You'd think so.
21380,But even if we eventually get caught up the delays have already cost 100s of lives and it's growing everyday.
21381,Why do you think they made this call?
21382,Do they just have a long history of surviving the actions and policies of various superpowers?
21383,"Depends entirely on where you are (and if in the US, what state you are in)."
21384,Try checking your local department of health page for information.
21385,"&gt; continuing to have those freedoms during a pandemic is why we have 3.5k deaths a day right now

No, it isn't."
21386,It's incompetent leaders.
21387,New Zealand or Taiwan are free countries and don't have any case.
21388,Meanwhile people are dying by the thousands in Russia.
21389,I won't submit to a totalitarian government because some guys there did nothing to contain a pandemic.
21390,"We're here because our leaders (both in the US and here in Europe) downplayed the threat and did nothing until it was too late, not because the army isn't shooting deniers in the street."
21391,"There was a huge chain of mismanagements, incompetence and of putting money over people's lives."
21392,"This isn't society's fault, and at least we're lucky that we can kick them out when they fuck up."
21393,The Chinese can't even complain.

21395,Only if they die quickly
21396,What happened in 92?
21397,"So, you’re saying there’s a chance!"
21398,Thank you for telling me about NY/NJ Vaccine situation.
21399,I take politics out of this subreddit and there is a subreddit dedicated to that it's r/Politics.
21400,speaking of the vaccine distribution looks like Shoprite has all 21 NJ counties covered.
21401,Dont you need to qualify for it lmfao
21402,Once you get the at risk group vaccinated there’s no reason not to start slowly opening things up.
21403,[removed]
21404,Stop making excuses and get to work.
21405,The endless china myth and feeding wall street is why you're failing after a solid year
21406,I am reading this as 40% of teachers intelligent enough to continue teaching once this is over.
21407,My parents just got theirs today.
21408,All the essential employees in their town have gotten theirs and now they are on to the 65+ crowd.
21409,Locally owned pharmacies are leading the charge by doing vaccines from 3-5pm.
21410,"Amazing that some stupid, racist, rednecks/black folks etc etc from south Georgia can figure it out but it’s too hard for others."
21411,The above statement was tongue in cheek but I do find it humorous that a podunk town will be vaccinated before the enlightened metropolis that I live in now.
21412,I think that’s totally understandable.
21413,"As an outsider, it seems to me that Japanese culture gets hit with a lot of stereotypes, both positive and negative."
21414,"Though I will say, when my husband and I visited, we were treated so kindly by everyone."
21415,It was really great.
21416,Your conclusion is unsupported by any evidence--it's pure speculation and hope.
21417,I'm not misunderstanding what they are saying.
21418,They are saying we will never eradicate the virus and they hope our vaccine efforts will keep it under control.
21419,"There is no ""return to normal life in developed countries"" while the virus runs rampant through under-developed nations."
21420,That's not reality in the 21st century.
21421,Our world is too interconnected to think like that.
21422,"There is no reality where Los Angeles goes about it's business while wild minks in Oregon hold reservoirs of the virus that hop, spread, and mutate at-will and unabated."
21423,"The same thing holds true for virus ""variants"" that are spreading unabated through South Africa."
21424,"The person you took issue with pointed this out succinctly: you can control the virus for a period of time, but it only takes one person with a new variant that resists the vaccine to cause global lockdowns."
21425,"We can continue to develop new vaccines, but even the most optimistic claim it will take a couple months to update the mRNA vaccines...meanwhile, international cities like the ones I live in (SoCal) will be locked down."
21426,Then we have to redistribute the vaccine around the world.
21427,"If we start to treat our medical infrastructure like our military infrastructure we might have a chance to get ahead of this, but given people like Fauci and others have predicted this since I was a teen in the 80s I don't have a lot of hope for that to occur."

21447,"mines is in six, days in california, dint they suspend all juries til further notice, im hoping it would get cancelled rather than postponed 6 months later when every is vaccinated, or its ok enough to OPEN all business up."
21448,"Well, they did well because all the infections came from ignorant Americans s/"
21449,Yes the UK has the vaccine much earlier then the EU because they bought it 6 months before.
21450,The gamble paid off
21451,"I’m no expert, but imo based on the way things are trending, I don’t think events with 50 people are gonna have the green light anytime soon."
21452,"Even with the rollout of the vaccine, things have been getting worse and businesses are gearing up for another shutdown."
21453,Hospitals around me already cancelled elective surgeries to make room for COVID patients.
21454,"Again, I’m no expert epidemiologist or anything, but if it were my money, I’d push things back a couple months and then see how things are going rather than losing deposits on a cancelled event."
21455,Thank you for your answer!
21456,I think the outdoor mask compliance there is much higher than many other places in the west.
21457,"Which is impressive considering many places experience more cases in a day than Taiwan has seen in a year

 And certainly many other places have higher percentage of normal single layer cotton masks, vs medical masks of N95."
21458,"sadly not uncommon to see people wear them below the nose either

I think this can be one part of the reason spread is higher in the west."
21459,"Very slow to adopt any kind of mask wearing here, by that time the virus has already seeded deeply."
21460,I think the west will pay more attentio to response of Taiwan as an example of what to do in a potential next pandemic
21461,So when they fail to get 20 million vaccinated by the end of this week.
21462,What's their next excuse?
21463,Ok fire them.
21464,And you're gonna replace them with....?
21465,Only in the movies do viruses evolve like that.
21466,More lethal is rare outside shortly after crossing over to humans.

21468,I will believe it when I see it

21470,A higher priority than living?
21471,Wow.
21472,I am a teacher and I feel for my fellow colleagues who have to do it every day.
21473,If you valued them the way you just pretended to then you should read some of their first-hand experiences and understand that they are not doing this willingly.
21474,By May 30 cases and deaths should be a lot lower than now and the vaccine should be pretty widely available.
21475,"Some younger guests may not have gotten the vaccine yet (or might have gotten only one does), but the older / more vulnerable guests should have had it for long enough to develop immunity."
21476,"Its possible that some guests might not be comfortable attending, but it is up to you if you want to take that risk."
21477,the antibody test is a different thing.
21478,"PCR and antigen tests are for seeing if you have an active COVID infection right now; antibody tests are for seeing if your blood has antibodies to the virus, aka if you have had it in the past."
21479,you're totally right re: PCR being more accurate than antigen when testing for an active infection though
21480,stoopid covid didnt think about that
21481,"Florida has less than half the COVID deaths as New York or New Jersey... that's according to the CDC, who has been hiding New York's numbers."
21482,Oh right I have seen tutorials for fabric masks where a filter goes inside a pocket in the fabric.
21483,Just fucking do it
21484,"they dont like zoom trials because they cant ""manipulate the juries easily, when they are zoomed."
21485,(as in the naive juries to sway 1 decision or the other).
21486,Yes.
21487,Presumably nurses.
21488,Haha I’m only 28!
21489,😓
21490,No but states probably should provide proper education.
21491,If they lose their employees they can't.
21492,Apparenly over 60 persons did not understand what pcgamerwannabe meant.
21493,"The rest of the teachers should follow others, they should form a strict union and parents should sue the shit out of the state of failure to provide education."
21494,The average teacher gets exposed to a ton of students on a daily basis.
21495,"Even if children are less likely to catch and spread it, that's still a lot of potential for exposure, especially if you have kids that aren't wearing their mask properly."
21496,"This study was also done in the UK, so the fact that they've had the more contagious strand which seems to have a greater effect on children might also play a role."
21497,[removed]
21498,Thank for getting the vaccine and sharing your story that hopefully helps others feel confident too!
21499,"Yes, I know."
21500,But it's stupid to think that a totalitarian government would do it better.
21501,It's usually the opposite.
21502,Why would you give even more power to those stupid people?
21503,"(or evil people, but I don't want to assume that)"
21504,"I’m really hoping J&amp;J is 70% or more, it’s single dose and easy to manufacture and store."
21505,Could be a game changer.
21506,They make concentrators that can meet an individual’s needs by pulling it from the household air.
21507,My grandfather had one.
21508,"Hospitals have centralized medical gas systems, and those are typically built to provide so much to so many beds—so you have the ability to have so much and need regular deliveries to replenish it (on top of every other O2 buyer and overloaded hospital) trying ordering more than the supplier may have the capacity to deliver."
21509,"I’m not sure exactly where the bottlenecks are—total commercial supply, amount deliverable in a window, or individual sites needing more than they were engineered for (extra beds, too many beds requiring O2, etc.)"
21510,Don't count on it
21511,I explained I live in a high risk household and they did not convince me that they implemented safe protocols.
21512,"I guess I worded it wrong, but they never got back to me and I didn’t go in."
21513,I’ve never refused jury duty before.
21514,So this felt like a strong refusal.

21526,These articles are irresponsibly causing undue fear among the populace.

21528,"Unstable patients with chance of survival; Trauma, car crashes, myocardial infarction, etc."
21529,are receiving priority care as they always have.
21530,Understood-  thank you for the answer.
21531,"medical masks, even if not as good as N95 are also good overall."
21532,The high level of  bidirectional  adherance to medical masks should prevent onward spread effectively in conjunction with other precauationaey measures.
21533,"And even though local transmission may no no longer be zero you're still doing better than pretty much any other country,  There are more cases in a few hours shere I am than in Taiwan in all year, if that's any consolation."
21534,I think you guys got this :)
21535,You should watch nurses explaining this.
21536,People dying on there death bed angry still believe not covid.
21537,Thinking its cancer or something else
21538,The pre-print that this article is based on is out.

21543,On social media I see a lot of friends traveling and it just doesn’t make sense to me.
21544,One of the people who has taken several trips even lost her dad to the virus.
21545,Didn't he say 20 million will be vaccinated by the end of December?
21546,Maybe stop saying lies and failing if you want people to trust you.
21547,What are the chances that I could safely have my outdoor wedding on May 30th this year?
21548,People will need to travel by plane.
21549,There will be at-risk people.
21550,"If the vaccine is available to the general public by April, that should be enough time to get the vaccine and build up immunity?"
21551,I would be losing about 4-5k in money I’ve deposited already into this wedding.
21552,"Unfortunately, I started planning in late 2019, and I postponed from November 2020 to May 30th 2021."
21553,But I’m feeling unsure again.
21554,Some family would be traveling from Mexico by car or plane.
21555,Should I postpone my wedding again?
21556,When would it be safe or am I overreacting?
21557,"Many on the r/weddingplanning are postpone-happy, but maybe they are on to something."
21558,Guest count would be maybe 50.
21559,Thanks.
21560,How exactly do you just “refuse” to go in for jury duty?
21561,"What's even more insane is they're saving vaccines for these tiered people, including healthcare workers, and many of them are REFUSING the vaccine."
21562,Reddit in a nutshell.
21563,Let's ignore this peer-reviewed study published in a scientific journal for unsupported anecdotes.
21564,Germany’s penalty in WWI led to WWII.
21565,Study your history book a bit harder lol.
21566,Maybe.
21567,Without a investigation we’ll never know.
21568,Sadly.
21569,Oh well.
21570,"Also, a lot of deaths are not investigated if they're not in hospital..... My guess"
21571,"Wow, thanks for all that information."
21572,I’ll try to watch for the updates.
21573,Where it's really hot and people try and stay indoors with AC?
21574,You’re misunderstanding what they’re saying.
21575,COVID is probably never going to be eradicated but the vaccines will likely bring it under control and allow a return to normal life in developed countries by ~mid-to-late 2021.
21576,We are indeed entering a new perilous phase of the pandemic because the UK B117 variant is wildly more contagious and is going to be much more difficult to contain and will require a greater uptake of the vaccines to develop herd immunity against.
21577,But the end of the pandemic in developed countries is in sight; we’re not going to be dealing with this indefinitely.
21578,"Kids need to be in school, especially elementary school kids."
21579,"Private school kids are going full time, many public schools as well and the rate of transmission has been low."
21580,Plenty of people go to work.
21581,I’m very liberal but the teachers are ridiculous.
21582,Twice that long because immunization requires two doses.
21583,Most places post the data of symptom onset in their data.
21584,If you see a large number from the 25th onwards you’re seeing that surge.
21585,"This is a very important study, and more eyes need to be on this issue very soon."
21586,Thank you.
21587,Does that make it worth it?
21588,"One of my favorites is people bitching about vaccines likely being required to fly, but thing is they never travel anywhere."
21589,No I meant your response that got deleted.
21590,"Packers comments don’t hurt my feelings, my team is my team and they’re likely much better than your team."
21591,😂 Keep trying though
21592,ffs
21593,He needs to be realistic.
21594,He himself said 20 million WILL be vaccinated by the end of 2020.
21595,That didn't happen.
21596,Not even close.
21597,How about stop the lies first of all?
21598,If you keep lying and failing don't expect to keep being trusted.
21599,Remember when he lied about masks back on February and March and said they didn't work?
21600,Today was a good day.
21601,"My coworker, who told me a couple of weeks ago that she didn't want to get the vaccine, changed her mind and asked for my help signing up for our hospital's staff vaccination waiting list."
21602,I am optimistic that more and more people will turn around as they see that people around them were fine after vaccination.
21603,"Later in the day, my girlfriend (who is a nurse in a different hospital) got bumped up their list and got her first dose!"
21604,She feels 100% fine so far.
21605,I can't wait to get mine and stop worrying about accidentally killing my patients.
21606,It feels like the world is getting brighter slowly but surely.
21607,MRNA vaccines.
21608,Updating for a new genomic sequence takes a few days.
21609,Thank you!
21610,"I’m only a little overweight, but I have an immune disorder which damages my joints and soft tissues - nothing high impact for me."
21611,I’ll check out the Facebook group and might give it a shot!
21612,Even more reason for you to stay at home if you have a medical condition.
21613,"If you lose your insurance, you can get Medicaid to assist you while you are picking yourself up."
21614,"This whole, “but my job” excuse is tiring."
21615,I am a covid ICU nurse working on the front line since February of last year.
21616,"TRUST me, you are playing Russian roulette with your life messing with this virus."
21617,You do not want to die the way people who get covid die.
21618,It is literally the absolute worst way to die.
21619,"I have held countless hands of patients last year bawling that they regret not wearing masks, not believing in covid, and regretting they did not take the pandemic seriously."
21620,I stay silent because there is nothing to say.
21621,"They all pass away in extreme agony, alone, and away from their families."
21622,"Trust me, stay the fuck at home."
21623,Don’t play Russian roulette with your life because you will regret it when I hold your hand in silence while you cry to me about how you should have listened and losing your job would have been better than losing your life.
21624,America is just maximum stupid.
21625,Tank man video?
21626,"The tanks stopped and tried to go around him, his friends picked him up."
21627,The end.
21628,The video is available on YouTube.
21629,But we have been saying the exact line you said since Nov... Lol?
21630,Sigh
21631,*Biological warfare
21632,This is true.
21633,Tired of chewing my damn instant coffee.
21634,I'd start with the state website but I don't know what texas has going on.
21635,Don't trust anything that isn't from the horse's mouth.
21636,An aggregate one.
21637,One that gives the number of people having severe reactions and the kind they had.
21638,But it also needs to give the wider context of it.
21639,"Yes, a nurse in Oregon had a severe reaction but that's one out of 50,000."
21640,It needs to written that these reactions are the exception and not the norm.
21641,"Probably best to throw in some statistics of long term effects of covid, too."
21642,"You might have a 1/10,000 (probably less) of a severe reaction from the vaccine but you might have a 1/50 chance of a severe reaction to covid."
21643,As someone who came down with an illness 6 years ago and still has lingering effects... don’t even risk it.
21644,I developed a dysfunction of the autonomic nervous system called POTS.
21645,"I also have issues with chronic fatigue, exercise intolerance, and heat intolerance."
21646,"Covid may not kill you, but it could alter your life for a long time afterward."
21647,Company’s don’t care.
21648,They’ll have you come into work.
21649,Well if you smoke and die of lung cancer its sad and they will try to save you but you were the one that smoked so its kinda your own fault.
21650,"Exactly like being fat and eating pizza, pop and fast food every day."
21651,"I don’t like the idea of shutting down all access to learning, but we should scale back grading dramatically, eliminate all standardized testing, and look for more ways to give the kids time in virtual small groups instead of either watching a lecture or learning on their own without interaction."
21652,I got news for you.
21653,They don’t care.
21654,"Really, they don’t."
21655,We were worth the price of a PS5 to them.
21656,"So, do you think they care if we die like rats in the streets?"
21657,No.
21658,They’ll just complain about the stench of the bodies and then hide in their mansions.
21659,"Throw in dedicated isolation facilities where you can go if your sick, testing cheap and rapid enough that you can do it every day (like brushing your teeth) and dedicated COVID hospitals to take care of the sick."
21660,That plus vaccines would allow us to co exist with the virus
21661,Thanks.
21662,My state requires a reason for postponement.
21663,I guess it won't hurt to call in and try to get out of it.

21683,It is the largest non–state-level government entity in the United States.
21684,Its population is greater than that of 41 individual U.S. states.
21685,"There are plenty of Republicans in the county, especially as you go inland."

21699,"I know things are going to look more ""normal"" in a few months but I'm feeling hopeless at the moment."
21700,All these articles about vaccines going bad and the rollout being incredibly poor are making me less than optimistic.
21701,I'm trying to plan ahead and make summer plans but it seems as though the things I really enjoy (i.e.
21702,"theme parks, concerts, broadway shows) won't be back until 2022 at the absolute earliest."

21711,They push this lie to defame China and the CPP (it's called [atrocity propaganda](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atrocity_propaganda)) because they're afraid of China and/or Communism taking over the world.
21712,"Now, you might think China taking over the world is a valid fear."
21713,But it goes back at least 200 years.
21714,"Even when parts of China were being colonized by the West, we were told to fear the Yellow Peril."
21715,"Even when China was in the grips of civil war, famine, and poverty, we were told to fear the Yellow Peril."
21716,"Even though China has never tried to expand its borders in 400 years, we have always been told to fear Chinese expansionism."

21750,did you really realistically expect them to contain it with a fraction of the information we have available now?
21751,especially after the western world has failed so so miserably trying to do the same with more information and time to prepare?
21752,"&gt;es, because there is a difference between peaceful student protestors and the actual violent clashes which lynched this policeman:

Nice example btw."
21753,"Oh hey, where are the pictures of those executed btw?"
21754,IMPORTANT CLARIFICATION: Nor this policeman or any protesters deserved this.
21755,Just to be clear on that.
21756,"The linked article indicates that Texas suspended all jury trials from March to June, creating a backlog that will take the court system years to clear out."
21757,"They experimented with ""Zoom trials"" and now apparently are experimenting with resuming in-person trials"
21758,I think we have a lot younger people.
21759,"Idahoan here and I can say not “healthy”, just a lot younger people (50 and under)"
21760,In China are people guilty until proven innocent?
21761,Microwaves have existed way longer than 15 years though?
21762,How does that relate.
21763,"Man, think how weird it would be if their freezers kept breaking until everyone was vaccinated /s

In all seriousness I hope they start working on getting the vaccines in arms sooner without being moved to do so due to equipment failure."
21764,I mean who are these people that show up within 2 hours for the vaccine?
21765,Do they automatically get the second dose because they got the first shot?
21766,I honestly didn't think the question through when i posted lol
21767,This is incredibly sad.
21768,He was young.
21769,I wouldn’t categorize him in the “healthy” category however.
21770,"Heart problems are prevalent in men, even very young men or teens especially in the US where diet is very very high in sugar, fats, and cholesterol and you actually have to put work into exercise because it’s easy to just drive everywhere and never even walk much day to day."
21771,Men in the US are pretty big and tall.
21772,That puts a lot of strain on the heart to pump blood through the body constantly.
21773,Couple that with a poor diet and little exercise and cardiac arrest happens a lot more than you would think.
21774,"With that said he is your average American, so I guess it’s a good thing these young deaths are newsworthy because they are so rare."
21775,Yeah you're still being willfully ignorant.
21776,I proposed a hypothetical where pfizer vaccines were destroyed or contaminated by some unplanned.
21777,"(E.g freezer malfunction, patients not showing up after dose thawing) none of those scenarios are relevant to the promise of allocation of second doses nor do such promises protect or insure such possibilities from occuring ."
21778,"These unplanned events are also able to be independent on distribution pipelines or supply chains 

 Similar scenarios have already happened in small numbers in the US and been covered by mainstream media."
21779,There are other possible scenarios where perhaps patients records are unavailable or inaccessible for whatever far flung reason and they are unable to identify what first dose they had received.
21780,"It doesn't matter what the hypothetical or how unlikely it is the point is you cannot guarantee these events from happening and that is what this document is about, deciding what to do in such events."
21781,Not writing the document does not prevent such events from happening.
21782,Not having such contingency plan document means there is no allowable path forward.
21783,Vaccinators are then the position where they have no choice have to leave the invidual with one dose because nothing else is currently permitted.
21784,"(Something manafacturers DO not recommend) as you know yourself 

Your response as usual, is disingenous."
21785,"I tried to help someone use the everbrite today, it sold out in milliseconds."

21788,I'd rather be a grinch then a grim reaper.

22163,How much social interaction do people think actually happens in schools that are properly following social distancing protocols?
22164,&gt;Data also shows they get and spread it less.
22165,"Ignoring the fact that the new strain seems to affect kids more, the average teacher is exposed to a LOT of kids on a daily basis."
22166,"Even if kids get it less, there is a ton of potential for exposure, especially if the students do not wear masks properly."
22167,&gt;They’ve ALSO found that frequently testing all student and staff reduces 90% of the spread.

22199,"A peaceful rural experience is still possible there, and car ownership is a bit more sensible."
22200,Naturally we love Taipei too which is why Taichung is more likely.
22201,North dakota
22202,Walgreens and cvs can only store the moderna vaccine because they don’t have freezers.
22203,That being said a competent government would have used the DPA to start making freezers 6 months ago.

22206,"Not in my area, no."
22207,Everyone at the hospital is pretty adamant about getting it or already has.

22210,"Perhaps aged in used rum,burbon and sherry casks."
22211,I'll do it.
22212,I'll smugly say I told you so.
22213,I work for the government in disease prevention and not even my co-workers listened to me back in February.
22214,Yeah but that is WAY easier all said than done in a place like NZ.
22215,Dismissing population density on top of all the other factors of juggernaut cities like London is ignorant at best.

22217,"Sure, but vietnam created their plan before that."

22221,Read promed listserv.
22222,Damn what's going on in Rhode Island?
22223,"There are over 24,000 mutations of COVID detected."
22224,None have mutated significantly enough to evade our immune system.
22225,The flu changes itself much more significantly than coronaviruses.
22226,"The source was provided up there by the first person who posted the numbers I'm using, but it's in french, I'll just copy and paste the part I edited in my other comment while you were replying:

I'm not just googling stuff, my numbers come from the INSPQ, I'm sure you have no idea what it is since clearly you're just here to bash and don't care about Québec itself."
22227,"It's Québec's health institute, they reviewed the numbers provided by Pfizer before deciding how to administer the vaccines and they found out, like many countries, that they were better off vaccinating 100 to have 92-93 immune after three weeks then vaccinating 50 to have 46-47 immune after four weeks."
22228,"I'll even be a gentleman and give you the source again: https://www.inspq.qc.ca/sites/default/files/publications/3098_vaccination_covid19_2e_dose_contexte_penurie.pdf

That's why it's important to use more than one source for your info."

22230,That's just sad.
22231,Breaking one negative record after another.
22232,And this happens in one of the most ''civilised'' rich countries.
22233,Hell.
22234,In sorry.
22235,That really stinks.
22236,Not even a doctor's note can invoke FMLA?
22237,Or are the unions so crippled there that you'd just get fired for sneezing the moment you returned to work?
22238,"Either way, I'm sorry you have to deal with that."
22239,Hang in there.
22240,Exactly this.
22241,100% Exactly this.
22242,Will never believe a word he says again.
22243,He lost all credibility.
22244,Top politicians have said we should approve it
22245,"Oh, I didn't know that."
22246,I was just trying to tease you because I'm jealous of your country right now.
22247,"Speaking of which, is that huge heatwave over the Artic affecting your weather much?"
22248,It's not gambling.
22249,Maybe learn the effects it has on 99% of the population and stop fear mongering.
22250,I thought this would be removed immediately but apparently not lol.
22251,Virtual Martial Law over there
22252,"But California is locked &amp; masked for months... why is the state with no masks or controls (Florida) doing 22x better per-capita, despite being a higher percentage of old people?"
22253,"Likely the variant,  other states should take notice because it's spreading."
22254,"If california has this case load with precautions, imagine other states that are not cautious when it will hit them."
22255,They should administer as many vaccines as possible.
22256,"&gt; Racing to beat the clock before the vaccines spoiled, they successfully  administered the entire supply in 2.5 hours in collaboration with the  county's health department and skilled nursing facilities."
22257,Good job.
22258,"I think if it was 100% excess death, or like a 1% IFR across all ages people would be scared enough to really want to isolate themselves, whether or not it was mandatory."
22259,"You could say the same for requiring PCR test results, etc."
22260,"Travel and leisure are for the wealthy with their private tests and vaccines, our lot is to work as proles."
22261,"I'm reading that fever is the most prevalent symptom of COVID, is that right?"
22262,Only curious because my gf tested positive today and we've both had the same symptoms for 4 days now.
22263,"We assumed they were sinuses, we just have stuffy noses, headaches, and nasal drip."
22264,Should we expect it to get worse or no at this point?
22265,That’s what’s strange about all of that.
22266,"If he had embraced the pandemic as a chance to show competence instead of assuming he’d be blamed for a virus existing at all, it would have been a totally different election."
22267,I'm on the fence about origins but you're absolutely correct - more information is never a bad thing.
22268,Congrats to the EU.
22269,Now they need to scramble to buy more vaccines.
22270,"In the place I live, We are."

22278,"There is a fringe of society, mostly boomers in business circles, who are tapped into certain overseas online information sources and satellite news."
22279,National is close to the Australian federal Liberals who wouldn't accept elimination was possible.
22280,The National-supporting business owners in the party who were extremely angry over the lockdown would have been loud voices.
22281,I doubt they would have imposed greater restrictions than in NSW but the difference is the MoH's contact tracing ability was weak which would have risked a big blow up in essential workers and may have created an unrecoverable situation.
22282,European governments can give emergency authorization if they choose to.
22283,No one is forcing them to wait for the conditional marketing approval.
22284,"&gt;I have more than once been in a situation where we've had to tell that one guy who's always late to show up 15-30 minutes earlier than the rest of us

22287,The population of greater New York metropolitan area in a space almost the size of Switzerland (mostly squeezed on the west and north coast.
22288,"But the island argument falls apart when you consider it’s less than 100 miles from the mainland, with 150 billion in trade and 3-4 million travelers a year between them."
22289,As the EMA i would also be cautious with waiting to long.
22290,Right now they can still say we need to wait for more data.
22291,"But the harder the lockdowns get and the more people are dying, the more likely a emergency approval from one of the eu countries become."
22292,"After that i am not sure, if other countries wouldn't do the same."
22293,"Atleast i am pretty sure, that countries won't hold still until april to get a vaccine which gets used in more and more countries."
22294,And it only takes on brick falling to get this rolling.
22295,"But to really know,  wouldn’t we need to compare a group of people infected with one variant versus another variant and look at hospitalization rates and death rates and ages etc of those severely affected?"
22296,Has this actually been done?
22297,"As far as making headlines more scary/exciting for the clicks...I totally agree that media does this, yes."
22298,But sometimes it’s also laziness or misunderstanding on the writer’s part.
22299,"this is all of china's bats coming home to roost, they are still getting away with too much though"
22300,&gt; Unless the AZ is proven to be “around the same level” as the mRNA vaccines I don’t see any chance of if being approved.
22301,That's not how the approval process works.
22302,"A few months ago a 95% effective mRNA vaccine would have seemed unlikely, they aren't now going to refuse other vaccines for failing to meet that very high bar."
22303,&gt; People taking it would feel as if taking a second class vaccine.
22304,It's already being rolled out.
22305,"I'm not aware of anyone refusing on the basis of being ""second class"", maybe because, in the middle of pandemic which has killed millions, a vaccine that is (worst case) 60% at preventing infection and 100% effective at preventing severe infections is much better than nothing."
22306,I’d agree with him for at least 2021.
22307,We’re not going to do anything that absolutely outrageous like fill an indoor stadium or concert venue up so soon.
22308,"I think we might get back to pretty close to full normal by then but then packing tons of people together is going to still be considered risky for some time to come, but not forever."
22309,&gt;It's actually important to keep highlighting that people's behavior is driving the size of the surge.
22310,It's not just a mutation outside of our control.
22311,Yep.
22312,"It's not going to end until people stop getting together, stop pretending that it's ok to eat indoors with a mask off (apparently the virus respects lunch time) around a bunch of strangers, stop flying without good reason, and until people stop with this anti-mask shit and get vaccinated."
22313,"If you don’t qualify, you get the same message."
22314,That’s fucking ridiculous.
22315,Anyone who can stay home should stay home.
22316,Is it realistic that America will never have concerts and sports with spectators?
22317,I don't think so
22318,also conclusion: season matters more than anything.
22319,For some reason Eastern Europe seems to have a later onset of flu season almost every year.
22320,"Maybe they dodged the spring outbreak because of this pattern, and were hit worse in fall."
22321,NZ real test will be March-June when their season for respiratory viruses start.
22322,Hoping for the best!

22324,I live down the street from the largest hospital on the Westside of LA and you’d think nothing was going on.
22325,It’s crazy how quiet it is
22326,Feel like schools are a real case by case Situation.
22327,My kids school give the option of in person or remote.
22328,Right now my kids are remote but we keep in touch with the teachers doing in person at their school.
22329,The teacher who would have been my sons teacher had he gone in person said they hadn’t had to quarantine since early September and that was one case because the child was exposed to the parent that was positive.
22330,They’re school is very small and is a private school I think at most there are like 10 kids in the kindergarten room.
22331,Now I know some of the public schools in the area have had more issues.
22332,Also have an aunt that works at a high school an hour away from me and she said the odd thing which only because last year students were dropping left and right with the flu but this year she hasn’t had 1 student miss do to flu or cold.
22333,Would obviously assume with the deep cleaning masks and preach of washing hands.
22334,It just seems there isn’t this blanket this is how it is for all schools so many factors playing into each school and area and prevalence of the virus.
22335,It’s maddening for parents and so tough especially for family and friends that I know that don’t have flexibility with work.
22336,"Teachers catching covid at 330% compared to
Other jobs and people call the union greedy for fighting for us to do remote learning"
22337,Does the vaccine work for this strain?
22338,This is every Reaganite’s wet dream.
22339,"Vaccines being put in arms in “small government” states, and sitting in a web of bureaucratic disasters in California and New York."
22340,What would happen if you said that you are a hippie that will vote for release no matter what.
22341,I'd love to know how we combat these conspiracy theories.
22342,People believe what they want to believe.
22343,Should critical thinking be taught in schools?
22344,Very distressing read.
22345,Yes.
22346,Why wouldn't they?
22347,You'd literally just be wasting the first shot if you denied them the second one.
22348,"Well there's an incendiary title edit, the actual article title is:

""'Status Not Available:' Some taxpayers won't receive stimulus check automatically"""
22349,The Dutch vaccination plan seems pretty wel thought out and the only concern is getting enough doses to the country.
22350,25 mass vaccination centers are being set up with capacity to vaccinate thousands every day each.
22351,I’m jelly
22352,[removed]
22353,I simply cannot understand why there are so many nurses and doctors on the front line refusing.
22354,Even 10% refusing is fucking huge.
22355,YESSS!
22356,We are very proud of that.
22357,UAE is really doing a great job to keep everyone safe.
22358,Remind me of the whole Kim Jong-Un is dead situation.
22359,Literally all coming from a single dubious source but since it was being spammed by every news channels everyone just start believing it unconditionally.
22360,No reason to find different sources when you can just repeat it until everyone gives in and believe you.
22361,I spent most of the year on furlough and then got laid off last week.
22362,Not too surprised considering the industry I work in has taken a big blow from the effects of the pandemic (it was already looking bad before the pandemic).
22363,What really sucks is that I’ve now lost my healthcare benefits too.
22364,And I imagine that many others are in the position I’m in.
22365,So many human impacts.
22366,"I agree live lectures are better for students, but even if they are recording them it’s not like lecturing is the only thing teachers do."
22367,"Lesson planning, responding to 87 emails a day, accommodating for IEPs, attending endless meetings, dealing with asshole parents..."
22368,Literally the only way Newsom will vaccinate people
22369,"So they aggressively tried to put out therapeutics and vaccines with the express goal of them not working and letting the virus spread out of control, which would have happened without the therapeutics and vaccines."
22370,How different would life be right now if EUAs had been granted in September 2020 and vaccination programs had started then?
22371,I know that was probably never realistic but there were plenty of optimistic timelines last year that it could happen that soon?
22372,Tbh I hate trump but I bet he woulda given out more then -0% of the vaccine unlike newsom
22373,"At the rate California is administering the Vaccine, we will be pariahs from the world"
22374,Coronavirus is going to be with us forever.
22375,We will probably need a corona vax every year (like the flu vax) or at some regular periodicity.
22376,So developing new/better single dose vaccines should still be a priority
22377,Ouch.
22378,I'm glad that Canada puts transportation under provincial jurisdiction.
22379,"&gt; Part of the reason could be orofecal transmission resulting in a very benign intestinal form of Covid

Can you point me to some papers that discuss this in more detail?"
22380,I am wondering why that results in a benign intestinal form of Covid.... shouldn't the body's immune response be the same no matter if the initial infection was through the cells in the intestinal epithelium or the respiratory tract?
22381,I’m in Charlotte and every restaurant I drove by was packed on Friday night.
22382,"We’ve had a day in the past week with 9,500 new cases which is insane and it wasn’t a backlog."
22383,Schools are opening for in person and there are signs on the side of the road for kids sports signups.
22384,Even the veterinary hospitals are slammed (I have vet tech friends) and the best specialty/emergency hospital in the area is beyond their ICU capacity.
22385,A tech who did 7-9 hospitalized patient discharges a day pre-covid is now doing 12-15 every day.
22386,The second a cage opens it’s filled again.
22387,"The pets they see are also way sicker since people are waiting longer to come in, and they are doing more euthanasias than anyone has ever seen in their entire career - way way way higher, and it only gets worse each month."
22388,"It’s even more crushing because euthanasia for financial reasons always rips into your soul - it’s such a powerless, hopeless feeling and it’s hard not to feel like a monster even when you aren’t the one that sets prices and you can’t control the economy that created the situation in the first place."
22389,People are having to cut expenses and a lot of long term medications are expensive - the prime example being heart disease meds.
22390,Tons of dogs are coming in with heart failure.
22391,The pandemic adds a whole new level of widespread economic hardship.
22392,"For many, many, many people that pet is their only friend, their only source of warmth and connection."
22393,You can’t just go out and get a new dog to replace a relationship that took 10 years to build with the old one.
22394,Pets are irreplaceable and each has a completely unique personality that will never be repeated ever again.
22395,The guilt eats people alive.
22396,"Many, if not most, local vet hospitals (even the ERs and really big specialty clinics) have had to close at least once due to a covid outbreak among staff."
22397,"The hospital I was talking about earlier now has staff wearing masks, face masks or goggles, gloves, and gowns all day."
22398,There are a finite number of doctors and experienced technicians in any one area so there’s no one to replace them if they become disabled by the virus.
22399,State licensing requirements mean that we don’t really have traveling nurses or doctors - all you have are the people already licensed in your state.
22400,The profession as a whole is fucked.
22401,"Capitalism was never, ever meant to be applied to veterinary medicine."
22402,The worst thing that ever happened to us was allowing MBAs to come in and run things.
22403,All they’ve done is ruined it all.
22404,Keep your dogs on heartworm preventative year round and keep all your pets vaccinated and spayed/neutered.
22405,Propectalin is a good over the counter diarrhea medicine.
22406,Take your pet in at the first sign of serious illness.
22407,KEEP YOUR DOGS ON A LEASH - hospitals are seeing record breaking numbers of dogs hit by cars.
22408,"They can store a ton not to
Mention the military also as a robust medical unit and give the soldiers logs of vaccines already."
22409,"Tbh they could probably make a new vaccine in a couple days, the bulk of the time is testing that it's safe/effective."
22410,Because the death rate is lower now hospitals are more filled and staff is stretch thin.
22411,NYC was so early before we knew how to help that it actually helped prevent ration of care since sadly the patients were dying to fill up space
22412, Courageous!
22413,/s
22414,True leader at the helm
22415,Lol?
22416,"Tell me princess, why did you go and party in groups of 10?"
22417,"A state and county with one of the strictest lockdowns in the nation, and yet cases surged."
22418,Genuinely curious.
22419,How much of New Zealand’s position right now has to do with the fact that it’s summer?
22420,"Have other countries in the Southern Hemisphere practiced a different response, and what is their current situation?"
22421,"Have countries in the Northern Hemisphere practiced the same response as New Zealand, and what is their current situation?"
22422,"I’m genuinely happy for NZ, and want to use it as an example for people who are okay with gathering, but I want to make sure I have the right facts."
22423,I read the article.
22424,"At least Florida seems to be making an effort to get as many vaccinated as possible, and is being open and public about the plans unlike some other states where the distribution is cloaked in mystery, the plans are full of generalities, and only about 30% of the available vaccine has been administered."
22425,The idea that production of vaccines in Q3 is going to matter is funny.
22426,Until summer we all end up either vaccinated or infected or killing ourselves.
22427,[removed]
22428,"No, I'm saying we should do everything in our power to make sure that the people that get it first are the people that actually need it."
22429,Pretty fucking badly
22430,"Sadly, there are c55 million Americans over 65."
22431,"With the shots going to healthcare professionals (which number in the millions) simultaneously (or first), there is absolutely no way we are reaching all Americans over 65 in two weeks."
22432,There simply isn’t enough supply and that’s before you consider distribution bottlenecks.
22433,"Want to back that up with some sources, chief?"
22434,"Additionally, absence of symptoms does not mean absence of contagiousness."
22435,"At least if we can't get the vaccine straight away we should be looking at drugs currently on the market that may help with symptoms, such as Ivermectin."
22436,What mask mandate?Mask wearing is taken about as srsly as wearing a helmet while riding a bicycle over here.And let's not even mention the pipe dream that is social distancing.
22437,"""I'd be happy to help you outside."""
22438,You seem like a troll.
22439,Apparently bureaucracy
22440,Fucking idiots.
22441,The whole idea that this is being decided by people who don't have their lives completely ruined is absurd.
22442,This is a disaster.
22443,"People are dying, not only from covid."
22444,There will be years-long wave of suicides after this nightmare.
22445,"But sure, we can wait until you are as sure as you wish!"
22446,Fuckers.
22447,You couldn’t be more wrong.
22448,If you’re vaccinated then you won’t get sick and symptoms won’t happen.
22449,Which is the whole point of vaccinating.
22450,[removed]
22451,locking down 4 million people compared to 350 million is a massive difference no one is talking about.
22452,The only logical conclusion at this point it that it is absolutely is everywhere.
22453,We simply aren’t testing for it everywhere.
22454,"The fact that CA has administered less than 10% of vaccines on hand is criminal, just as bad as anything Trump has done, Newsom should be held accountable for the deaths due to the slow rollout"
22455,Yeah I was angry about headlines like this from last week (hospital administration receiving vaccines before medical staff).
22456,But then I heard the news about how few are receiving the vaccine and I no longer care.
22457,Just get people vaccinated.
22458,The more stories like this generate outrage and backlash the more auditing will need to be involved in administering the vaccine and it'll just take longer.
22459,"I get that this is cutting the line, but we are sacrificing accuracy for speed here and I think it's an ok trade off."
22460,"This isn't a police state folks, everyone is doing the best they can."
22461, Like birds people fly south/west for the Holidays.
22462,Since the articles never mention sources of outbreaks it probably due to 0 contact tracing.
22463,"I  starting to doubt any government will say, ""ok now it's over, open up!"""
22464,"So the only way it goes back, is if we just kinda start living life normally on our own after a quorum has been vaccinated, deaths and hospitalizations go down, etc."
22465,I could also see it coming back through mass force if the public is pushed too far.
22466,But I really don't want that to happen.
22467,I don't think anyone does :/
22468,"I thought it was 4-6 weeks to create the new vaccine itself, not test it."
22469,That's good at least.
22470,Neither of those say anything about April?
22471,El Salvador too so five.
22472,Hopefully EU will get more doses than planned.
22473,Currently very low amounts are expected until Q4.
22474,We had a Chinese man here in Singapore who recovered from covid-19 but weeks later he died from blood clots in his heart.
22475,Was only in his 40s.
22476,I think when people don’t know anyone with covid or they are mildly affected by it they just can’t be bothered about it.
22477,"To them, severe covid happens to other people but never them."
22478,"Yeah, I dont like to be rude on the internet, but that's a incredibly stupid question."
22479,That's great but it's your opinion of 3 countries.
22480,"I'm only speaking of my opinion as well, but I'm telling you as a person of the country that it's viewed differently."
22481,You can see from the other comments in relation to the person that said they are Ivy League that it's a common view haha.
22482,New Zealanders deserve full credit for their handling of the pandemic.
22483,"However, and not to detract from what they achieved, there were other countries that also locked down early and hard and did not fare so well."
22484,Argentina is a great example.
22485,Here is an article from WHO prasing Argentina for their response - and indirectly criticizing their neighbour Brazil which became a poster child for how not to respond to a pandemic.
22486,"https://www.who.int/news-room/feature-stories/detail/argentina-there-is-no-economy-without-health  
  
Fast-forward to today and Brazil actually has the same number of cumulative cases, and fewer cumulative deaths per capita than it's southern neighbour."
22487,"There are a lot of investigations still to be done to find what worked and what didn't, but it's not as simple as just saying ""shut down everything and you'll be OK""."
22488,For one thing a lot of poorer countries just can't shut down - people would starve to death.
22489,And yes we need to do something about this; it's a disgrace.
22490,But sadly it is the current reality.
22491,"Anyway, congratulations to NZ and enjoy your pubs and sports - you deserve them."
22492,"Meanwhile in TN with 20% positivity, school resumes next week!"
22493,Tedros is being re-educated by his Beijing superior right after issuing the criticism.
22494,"It sucks, Newsom only cares about his image not actually helping or doing the right thing."
22495,We will have had more vaccines expire than be administered at this rate by the end of Jan

22534,We are sitting on several hundreds of thousands of doses right now.
22535,Yes.
22536,Nice!

22538,"As an EMT, a couple things I’ve seen in the past couple months have nearly broken me."

22540,"Imagine knowing someone on the other side of a door is possibly infected and is no longer breathing, and will be dead in 1-2 minutes...and knowing it takes 4-5 to get on scene, get all of your PPE on and get in the door."
22541,"Getting to the home and knowing that if you rush in right now, you may stop her from being brain dead."
22542,"And knowing that if you do, you’ll be exposed to Covid, and might infect dozens more if you end up getting it."
22543,"And furthermore knowing your local health dept said you can work until you are symptomatic, because there aren’t enough people without the virus to fill all the EMS shifts."

22566,"Moderna didn't need to match multiple trials together, Moderna didn't screw up dosing."
22567,But that is not the point of vaccines.
22568,"The point of a vaccine is to eradicate a disease, not keep it manageable."
22569,"If there are any carriers of a disease, that is a problem because that means the disease can mutate and become more deadly or transmissible."
22570,Allowing a portion of our population walking around with COVID and spreading it to other people or unknowingly allowing it to mutate in themselves is unacceptable.
22571,"Yes, making sure that all of the vulnerable populations and medical professionals are vaccinated is really important but getting everyone else to get their COVID shots is also super super important and really the only path to eradicating COVID."

22666,With such disparities only a few positives/negatives can swing millions when multiplied across an entire population.
22667,"I'm not besmirching the results, just saying they need to be validated by additional research approaches before they could be considered authoritative."
22668,"Assuming the uk's population was the same size as america then it would be 5,126 deaths."

22675,Does anyone know how long the vaccine is effective for?
22676,How is it even possible to vaccinate only 700 people in the course of one week I assume?
22677,A single nurse can probably administer 700 vaccines a week.
22678,Yeah but lets face it the US fucked up on a lot of levels not directly related to population
22679,It was the tutorial level and we failed it LOL.
22680,Do we know anything about the parameters of the new strain?
22681,"Like, I didn't used to be paranoid making quick masked grocery trips or getting passed by an unmaksed runner based on what I think I understood of Covid transmission."
22682,Do we know if these things are still generally low risk with the new strain?
22683,Everything is not open.
22684,They've shut down practically all non-essential indoor businesses.

22746,Just doing my best to spread my own special brand of sarcastic cynicism around the world.
22747,I don’t think anyone other than admins are arguing that morally the hospital admins should be getting the vaccine prior to at risk people.
22748,Logistically it’s easier to vaccinate people who work in the hospital bc that’s where the vaccines are currently being given as opposed to bussing in then wheeling in people from nursing homes to the 2nd floor vaccine clinics.
22749,Eventually vaccine will be brought around to nursing homes but that is a different and more complicated vaccination model than what the US is currently relying on for mass vaccinations.
22750,"I think the US should do that but the government is currently relying on health care systems to administer the vaccine, hiring mobile vaccination units is phase 2 which we clearly aren’t prepared for yet if we are struggling with phase 1."

22772,Why do you need non-experts and vaccine denialists to have access to the raw data before you accept actual experts' conclusions?
22773,But ... vaccinated people already have antibodies to fight off the virus.

22794,I had the moderna vaccine.
22795,You know that feeling when you first hit the gym and you're sore the next day?
22796,That's was it for me and I was better by the afternoon.
22797,The beauty of capitalism.
22798,No way they defund an organization that does what the WHO does for them.

22805,Welcome to Reddit where Americans will shit on the US and think/want it to be a third world country to advance their arguments.
22806,Fixed it for you homie.
22807,Such high numbers who gives a shit who's highest this is just a sad day.
22808,That mild criticism is a year too late.
22809,AND the vaccine roll out is just a mess..promises NOT kept
22810,that is for veto proof.
22811,I don't think Biden will veto the bill
22812,Competency?
22813,From the British government?
22814,"Lol

It was stupid, they announced the tier 4 restrictions on London, so everyone just crammed onto trains and the motorways and left London."
22815,"When asked on TV what people should do if they are planning on doing that, they just said they shouldn't."
22816,They didn't even attempt to control what people were doing.
22817,"I know multiple people that left London just before, and during the tier 4 restrictions, to all over the country and no one was stopped."
22818,Hardly surprising that it spread nationwide so far
22819,No it doesn't.
22820,"To all of them, not enough time has past to be 100% confident."
22821,This virus has only been around for a little more than a year.
22822,"If immunity last 10 years, it would be impossible to know for another 9ish years."
22823,I'd also say that immunity is not black and white.
22824,Studies suggest the overwhelming majority of people have signs of immunity at least 7+ months after infection.
22825,"Immunity is likely much longer on average, there just hasn't been enough time to be 100% sure."
22826,"For the vaccine, phase 3 trials only started about 5 months ago, and the latest update was around 2-3 months most infection so the bare minimum is 2-3 months."
22827,"Though again the expectation is much longer, Pfizer has said they expect a year at minimum, with the potential for much longer."
22828,yup - but you can't fire 100. you need to be on the same page or unions don't work.
22829,[removed]
22830,No one is saying they shouldn't get the vaccine.
22831,They are just saying they shouldn't get the vaccine *before* citizens.
22832,"New Zealand definitely handled it very well, especially compared to the US, but it also helps that they're a small island nation."
22833,"Anyway, I'm very happy for them and wish the same results for the rest of the world."
22834,"Well LA DE FRICKIN DAH

(No I’m not jealous or anything... I’ll just dry my tears with muh freedoms...) 😭😭

At least there’s some hope for humanity."
22835,It hasn't actually gotten the vaccine in people's arms any quicker.
22836,You aren't setting records here.
22837,It served no purpose.
22838,"Once again,  hot air"

22840,then the union needs to have your back.
22841,collective bargaining only works if everyone is bought in.
22842,shame on the other 60% of chicago teachers that didn't show solidarity.
22843,"The issue is absolutely prioritization, millions of vaccines are waiting to be used bevause the right people aren't available to get them."
22844,So instead of them being used to protect people they are doing nothing.
22845,Sorry but 60 votes
22846,"Also wet markets exist in many countries, so millions of people have been exposed for long periods of time for centuries."
22847,"If viruses could change so rapidly to create strains that infect newly over and over again, it would have already happened with the common cold and created hundreds of mutated deadly transmissible variants capable of wiping us out long ago."
22848,"That's either a very big rock, or a very bouncy one!"
22849,[removed]
22850,It’s called setting up the narrative and normalizing it.
22851,The population sees it more and more and starts normalizing it.
22852,"Then when the actual thing is rolled out, no one bats an eye."
22853,🤷🏼‍♂️
22854,It still has Christmas deaths to arrive.
22855,The dems need 50 plus the veep vote and they have that.
22856,This creates low stability for the future but still passes
22857,&gt; the issue isn’t a purely statistics one.
22858,So you agree with my statement that you believe that avoiding the appearance of ethical impropriety is more important than the lives that could be saved by actually checking instead of assuming.
22859,"That’s all I wanted to know, thanks"
22860,"When it comes to long term damage or illness the only thing we can rely on is anecdotes, surveys, preliminary research, and speculation."

22864,"I love how one , non peer reviews study gets tons of upvotes."
22865,Multiple studies that show no immunity past 6 months without a vaccine but will get downvotes.
22866,"You can't wish for what you want , reality is what it is,  you adapt or dont."
22867,I have few friends in LAFD and they are saying for many people this will not make a difference
22868,Teachers are unionized

22872,But you plan ahead regardless.
22873,Reddit also has an anonymous downvote button.
22874,The true crazies on my FB friends list have their amplification tamped significantely if this feature we're introduced.
22875,Nobody wants to see the vegetables cure cancer videos.
22876,"They’ve been saying that “at this point it’s impossible to eradicate Covid” since March, all the while saying “whoops had we acted more diligently we actually COULD have eradicated it at X point in time”."
22877,I live in LA.
22878,Yesterday we took our dog for a walk and saw a playground of 20-30 kids from 15-20 families.
22879,No one was wearing a mask and the kids were on top of each other.
22880,I'd just say let the people get sick at this point.
22881,What else can you do?
22882,The citizens obviously don't give a shit.
22883,"From what i remember Jacinda telling us, we can host them but with only a few family members and social distancing."
22884,Exactly.

22893,movie theaters hardly worry about your ticket sometimes
22894,I'm gonna go out on a limb and say there's no point in us conversing.
22895,Unless of course you have any info/research on the new variant and reinfections?
22896,"Possible there just isn't any, even if its something or not."
22897,Thanks for the help.
22898,tHirD wAvE Winter 2021!
22899,And no one even follows through with what it would take to enforce quarantine in the US where people have so many guns.
22900,"You'd essentially have to deploy the army to shoot people on sight if they congregate illegally, at least in places like Texas."
22901,Remember the BLM protests?
22902,How many people would have to be shot on sight to terminate them?
22903,The US would have to turn into a full blown dictatorship for 18 months to truly stop the virus.
22904,"Yes, for the people who are vaccinated, will be close to normal."
22905,It seemed based on the conversation in the thread that we were talking about a point in time when the at risk groups were vaccinated.
22906,That's when I'm saying i want my life back and I'll take the risk.
22907,"I mean, you're kidding right?"
22908,You need two shots about 3-4 weeks apart to get immunity and then it probably takes a week or two minimum after the last shot.
22909,So during this 6 weeks you definitely need to wear a mask.
22910,After that is a little debatable.
22911,"So almost like we socialize the costs, while they privatize the profits?"
22912,Why is it SO important that teachers don't have to go to work?
22913,PLENTY of people are just going to work.
22914,"I work in a department store either unboxing/sorting /hanging /putting out stock, or else cashier/tidying sales floor."

22916,My daughter has been working at in person restaurants.
22917,Millions of other people are doing it too!
22918,Why do teachers need to be home?
22919,I mentioned that plenty of people are just GOING TO WORK in a thread somewhere about Chicago teachers and got tons of down votes with no explanation of what the difference is.
22920,I don't see it.
22921,Is it raining asshats or what?
22922,People died?
22923,I thought like only 20 people in the US even took daraprim.
22924,I'm pretty sure using daraprim killed more people in the 50s and 60s than anybody who died from not using it today.
22925,"(Is it zero, i can't find anyone that died from not getting it)"
22926,"Those don't affect him, personally."
22927,I don't think he would be up for spending many extra hours in person.
22928,He doesn't want to get sick and doesn't want the GOP getting sick either
22929, Should be something a little more enticing.
22930,2 months rent or mortgage
22931,It would appear you were missing a question mark then.
22932,"Glad Newsom doesn't seem to be going the way of Cuomo, and isn't imposing fines and punishing hospitals for giving things out of order if they have to in order to save doses from being wasted."
22933,Still super slow rollout tho.
22934,Shots in arms.
22935,We need more shots in arms.
22936,Not necessarily.
22937,"Some infections need boosters every now and then, like tetanus."
22938,"Others need to be adjusted on a regular basis, like influenza (which, fwiw, mutates in a faster and much different way from coronaviruses)."
22939,Immunity is also not an off/on switch.
22940,"Some people just don’t form great immunity to viruses, for whatever reason."
22941,"Some people can get sick a second time, but with no/mild symptoms, since their body is partially reacting."
22942,"There was a lot of concern early on, since antibodies seemed to drop quickly to SARS-CoV-2."
22943,There was also the fact that common cold coronaviruses have been documented to cause reinfection in the 6 month-1 year timeframe.
22944,"That’s why these studies are important - because along with the low number of confirmed/suspected reinfections, they mean we won’t have to re-vaccinate every few months."

22950,Hawaii would've been fine if they were allowed to shutdown flights like New Zealand did.
22951,No one in or out for 18 months.
22952,One answer is that they should just start vaccinating the first 3-4 groups simultaneously and forget about all of the restrictions and just go faster.
22953,Another answer is that they aren't really going to do this until they are sure there won't be vaccine scarcity.
22954,To convince them I think places are going to have to either stockpile enough vaccine to be sure or be certain enough of future deliveries to let go the reins.
22955,It's like people hoarding toilet paper.

22964,If you’re a public figure trying to recommend and model smart choices for people in the name of public health if  there ever was a year to simplify your life this is it.
22965,We had a number of holidays that people gathered for against recommendations in short succession.
22966,"Labor day, Thanksgiving, Christmas and New Years with people all breaking the rules and spreading exponentially"
22967,"If it makes you feel any better I live in a student flat with 4 others, one of us tested positive and we had to quarantine for 14 days - NONE of us got any symptoms whatsoever."
22968,Also my flatmate's sister tested positive who she was in contact with over Christmas so we had to isolate again - still none of us got any symptoms.
22969,"Point is, being in contact doesn't mean that you're guaranteed to be infected."
22970,Just wait.
22971,2020 started normally and it’s appearing more and more likely that the end of 2021 will have the old normal for a fair bit of time.
22972,That’s not that much time lost to the pandemic in the grand scheme of things.
22973,"Even if you personally don’t care about the risk of symptoms, you should care that hospitals are struggling and can’t give other injuries or illnesses the attention they used to be able to give because patients with Covid are clogging the system."

22977,Teachers probably have it worse than most retail.
22978,30 kids in a classroom with no ventilation for hours at a time.
22979,"Or at the high school level 30 kids in a classroom with no ventilation for 40 minutes, then another group of 40, then another... 150 kids sharing air with you every day."

22987,&gt;Isn't the whole reason we're scared of the coronavirus because it's a specifically deadly single strain of flu?
22988,No; a coronavirus is not a type of influenza.
22989,Coronaviruses and influenza viruses are different viruses.
22990,"&gt;Isn't it supposed to last... you know, forever?"
22991,Isn't that the point of getting fucking vaccine?
22992,Many vaccines require boosters.
22993,Read this: [You May Not Be Immune Forever - Why Boosters Are Important](https://www.passporthealthusa.com/2016/06/why-boosters-are-important/)
22994,Yes it does.
22995,"It speaks in favor of half-dosing Moderna, and [first doses first](https://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2020/12/first-doses-first.html)."
22996,It speaks in favor of doing everything we can to speed up the vaccination process.
22997,"Recently (November), I went to emergency at a hospital of my choice to have a possible fracture looked at."
22998,The hospital is the last place I wanted to be because of COVID-19.
22999,"After evaluation by a nurse and a doctor, x-rays, confirmation of a fracture, and receiving treatment, I got into my car for the drive home and glanced at the clock noticing that less than 2 hours had elapsed."
23000,Not bad despite COVID-19 conditions and precautions.
23001,I didn't even get asked for my health insurance info.
23002,NZ made it through the winter flu season with basically zero flu this year and totally contained a Covid second wave in mid winter in the poorest and most densely populated area of the country.
23003,"Seasons make no difference is there is no Covid present at all, thus the elimination approach."
23004,"We stop all cases at the border, so winter isn't a risk."
23005,"This is why we don't let ""businessmen"" run the country normally."
23006,Whoops I read that wrong.
23007,It is more like 60% of cases in the UK which is why such a big deal is being made about it.
23008,"Again, do you have a source for those results?"
23009,The link says nothing about the results.
23010,Everywhere.
23011,Hey I know about 20 of those people.
23012,Funny part is that 4 of them changed their minds when they got COVID-19.
23013,One is even a COVID-19 evangelist now after spending 4 days in the hospital.
23014,Is that a different strain from the UK one?
23015,I remember hearing community spread there was already ongoing
23016,"Here's a quote from the actual agency in question and not the FDA: 

&gt; EMA has not set a minimum level of efficacy for approval."
23017,This is because it looks at the overall balance of safety and efficacy for each vaccine individually before concluding on whether or not it will approve the vaccine.
23018,"&gt; As an example, 'vaccine A' could have a lower efficacy than 'vaccine B'."
23019,"However, vaccine A could have other advantages, such as:

 &gt;   fewer side effects;

 &gt;  easy storage and delivery;

 &gt;  better results in a specific age group or type of population."
23020,"&gt; In spite of this, medicine developers should design studies to demonstrate a rate of efficacy of at least 50%."

23022,How is it being blocked?
23023,They haven't submitted for review yet because the US trial isn't finished
23024,Yeah indeed it will be interesting to see in a few years how much COVID mutates once it’s under control.
23025,Maybe the speed at which the first vaccines were developed means we’ll be well posed to stay in top of mutations with alterations to the vaccines (and plus the vaccines in play right now seem to work for all the variants so maybe the mutations will be a non issue.)
23026,I’m in the skeptical that we can pull it off camp but it sure would be nice to see it fully eradicated!
23027,[removed]
23028,I think there are a lot of reasons for optimism but the media just refuses to publish anything remotely positive.
23029,Many areas are up to vaccinating 3-4% of the population and it's going to ramp up quickly.
23030,We don't need to vaccinate everyone to make a big difference.
23031,80% of the fatalities occur in 15% of the population.
23032,"Once we vaccinate the ""right"" 15% I think things will change quickly."
23033,3x seems too low considering how hard it was to get a test in the first half of the year and the number of individuals who might be asymptomatic or just won’t test even if sick.
23034,"If we look at total deaths, it seems plausible that 30-40% of the country has been infected."
23035,"That commenter is exaggerating, but the point is that we were in a pretty good postiion with vaccines."
23036,"Now, vaccination is lagging projections, while the rate of spread *might* be increasing."
23037,A lot of people are watching the data on this variant anxiously.
23038,&gt; Why isn’t this common knowledge for patients?
23039,"Because 

&gt; Not backed up by studies at all, it’s all anecdotal, but I’ve talked to people"
23040,It actually sounds like an interesting concept.
23041,I wouldn't hate on it just because I couldn't afford because I would be using it if I could afford it honestly.
23042,"However, another thing to take away from the fact that this service exists is that our medical system can use a big giant overhaul."
23043,No one said anything was a silver bullet 100% cure.
23044,"Well, other than the people that keep claiming it's going to disappear by Easter, spring, summer, election day, etc...


Man you guys have issues."
23045,It had everything to do with containment and management of COVID.
23046,"An actual lockdown, in order to be effective, requires a data-driven analysis and contact tracing of each and every COVID case and all the hotspots."
23047,"Sweden and most of the lockdown countries that fared poorly just were not able to log cases and track and isolate them to prevent further transmission in time, the purpose of the lockdown."
23048,"Therefore, the secondary purpose of those lockdowns became to mitigate the overwhelming of hospitals."
23049,They're exposed to higher numbers of sick people compared to the rest of the population.
23050,"I wouldn't say they should be higher priority than elderly people but I'd say they're at the same level of priority, since they are providing care to the sick."
23051,It didn’t originate in the U.K. but yes.
23052,Both the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines are 2 dose vaccines.
23053,"The first dose provides a ~50% chance of never getting a symptomatic case of Covid (I'm pulling the 50% number from memory, someone correct me if I'm wrong)."
23054,The 2nd dose provides about a 95% chance of never getting a symptomatic case of Covid.
23055,Everyone who gets the 1st dose will be offered the 2nd dose.
23056,You don't need to vaccinate everybody.
23057,US probably only needs about 50% vaccinated to provide herd immunity since 0.5 x 0.7 + 0.3 = 0.65.
23058,Actually would expect deaths to drop at lower numbers given it's targeted.
23059,"Community transmission might even drop, although the new strains might counter that."
23060,I still hold that Q2 will be when several badly affected countries can return to mostly normal.
23061,"We’ll see, you’re only looking at this current generation of humans."
23062,"Our grandkids will not be affected by the weakened state of our generations, and will be better off due to it."
23063,"Along with that, if people die we will lower our population - helping our planet as well."
23064,"501.V2 carries a mutation in the spike protein called E484K, which is not present in the UK strain, Francois Balloux, the director of the University College London Genetics Institute, says in a statement."
23065,"“**The E484K mutation has been shown to reduce antibody recognition,**” he says, *which may help the virus bypass immune protection provided by prior infection or vaccination*."
23066,It seems to me that 501.V2 will soon be fairly ubiquitous.
23067,"I think that we need to wear masks, work from home (where possible) &amp; socially distance for the next 5 years."
23068,Coronavirus has earnt the respect of the wise.
23069,"He, and anyone else who believes in god, acted on religious beliefs, so he's perfectly fine and legal"
23070,"Here's the latest case/death charts for Georgia, with running 7-day averages:

[https://www.statmap.org/?LOCALE=Georgia#data](https://www.statmap.org/?LOCALE=Georgia#data)

Not as bad as some places."
23071,We'll see if that changes.
23072,Overall the state is at 100.92 deaths per 100k population.
23073,That's slightly below the national average.
23074,"Georgia ranks 22nd among US states for per capita deaths:

23077,Short answer.
23078,Money.
23079,Long answer.
23080,Money.
23081,"That makes sense, I guess its kind of gotten out of hand for most of Europe."
23082,Was a serious attempt at contact tracing made in summer in Europe when the numbers were low?
23083,"Right now, over 5,000,000 Americans [have received their first dose."
23084,"](https://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/covid-vaccine-tracker-global-distribution/) It seems like Slaoui will have shipped the 20,000,000 doses he planned on getting into arms within the first week of January, but sadly the injections don't seem to have gone as quickly as the shipments."
23085,Hopefully the federal and local governments can work together to fix that as quickly as logistically possible.
23086,"I think Slaoui's goal of vaccinating 100,000,000 people by or in March becomes much less likely every day that we ship more vaccines than we inject, but hopefully the daily shots will continue to rise exponentially until we're at a point of 2,000,000 or even 3,000,000 doses being given every day."
23087,teachers are not medical workers.
23088,not sure why you would think that.
23089,Did you ever attend school in the USA?
23090,We are in such unchartered waters.
23091,Past pandemics did not have the mass global or localized travel we have today.
23092,They did not have much of what we have today that have been sources of spreading events.
23093,Whole new game.
23094,Whole new world.
23095,What is the push for reopening schools besides $$$?
23096,"I have been doing remote classes for my MBA and it's easier for everyone and requires no overhead on the classroom cleaning, electricity, etc."
23097,and on top of that it's safer and more fun.
23098,Most of them are not preventable.
23099,COVID is.
23100,"I'm going to steal that analogy, if you don't mind."
23101,Based on population the UK has actually had **more** deaths than the USA.
23102,"Turns out keeping schools open was a truly shit idea, and the NHS has been so starved of funds that it's collapsed."
23103,No because there is a tangible end.
23104,A vaccine.
23105,[removed]
23106,That makes a whole lot of sense.
23107,For sure.
23108,Really proud of that and glad we got things done fast.
23109,We brought the cases down a lot too.
23110,Why not fault Sweden for not using the Taiwan strategy?
23111,"If Taiwan could have taken steps not to lockdown internally while mitigating COVID, Sweden could have done the same, it has nothing to do not locking down."
23112,"South Korea also did not lock down internally but has a death rate nowhere near Sweden's, same goes for Iceland and Finland."
23113,"If other no-lockdown countries don't have the same problems as Sweden, maybe the weak link in Sweden's strategy isn't a lack of a lockdown."
23114,Spouse of a teacher here: Apparently I can't say which area I'm from because it will get removed.
23115,"Anyways, our district went virtual and then parents threw a fit and the school board caved."
23116,Now we are in person no matter what because they voted to disassociate with the state health department map.
23117,My wife is terrified because once the teachers get the vaccine they are not going to have a mask mandate and I can't get a vaccine until phase 4 (whenever that is).
23118,Passes into law on Wednesday.
23119,The police have powers to arrest and fine those found disregarding measures.
23120,But on a large scale this relies on the will of the people.

23145,For a minute I  thought Wisconsin had their shit all in one bag.
23146,Apparently not.
23147,Forget about supply.
23148,It's the application that is lacking.
23149,Germany had 1.3M doses by end of December.
23150,"Factoring in the expected deliveries, that means they should have vaccinated 1M people by now."
23151,"They did not for various reasons, but mostly they totally, utterly, fucked up the organization of vaccinations."
23152,Turns out that sending a letter with a QR code for online reservation to 90+ year olds a day before the vaccination begins is a good recipe to keep the workload low.
23153,Check harbor freight for masks.
23154,If you live in the states.
23155,There’s already a permanent wildlife reservoir in the US and Denmark at the very least from escaped mink.
23156,"There are farms where the minks, humans, cats, and even farm dogs were all infected."
23157,Minks are brilliant animals and many of them escape every year.
23158,4/5 wild minks in Denmark were born on mink farms (they can tell by analyzing the teeth - wild mink eat freshwater fish and farmed mink eat ocean fish).
23159,Take this one step forward - let’s look at a wet market in Peru in the Amazon rainforest.
23160,There was one shut down because literally every single stall operator tested positive.
23161,Those positive people are jam packed in there ear to ear with tons of humans and every animal species they can get their hands on.
23162,"Some of those market animals escape or are released and if they contracted covid, they potentially create a new reservoir species."
23163,We’ve learned that more than just a few species are vulnerable.
23164,The virus mutates more with every species jump since it has to adapt to the new host.
23165,This isn’t just Russian roulette with mutations - the mental image I’m getting is a thousand bouncy balls being dropped down a flight of stairs and it’s just pure chaos.
23166,It doesn’t matter if 99.9% of the resulting mutations are harmless - that 0.1% is all it takes to create covid20/21/+.
23167,"The sheer number of infections and species jumps occurring mean the virus will out-evolve our attempts at suppression, over and over again."
23168,"Sure, vaccine makers may need to tweak their formula and can do that in less than 2 months, but we now have a front row seat to how difficult global distribution truly is."
23169,I don’t care if you call me a doomer or if you downvote me because what I’m saying directly confronts your unhealthy denial coping mechanism.
23170,"Do with the info what you will, I’m beyond caring because the writing is on the wall."
23171,"The human population reached 1 million approximately 3,000 years ago."
23172,Around 1800 we reached 1 billion people.
23173,A mere 200 years later and we’ve hit 7.7 billion.
23174,That’s a hyper exponential growth rate that’s essentially a straight line up on a graph.
23175,Covid is nature imposing checks and balances.
23176,We’ve negatively impacted nearly every single species and ecosystem on the planet.
23177,This is essentially divine retribution for our disrespect towards life and our insatiable greed - especially that of billionaires.
23178,That’s it folks.
23179,"A permanent wildlife reservoir means game over, and we already have them in multiple countries."
23180,"&gt;Philadelphia just said it will take “a full year” to vaccinate everybody in their city

You have to remember that governors and mayors are speaking in hyperbole when it comes to getting government aid."
23181,"It's easy to read that or hear it and sound the alarm, but 1) it's true - it *can* take a year to vaccinate *everyone*, especially when you count those who are nervous about the vaccine."
23182,"2) According to Philly's current rollout, things are going very, very slow."
23183,Of course the mayor is gonna say that to get the attention.

23218,I mean it's fairly easy to verify their age and anyway the elderly are the ones filling up hospital beds
23219,"No, with millions of people getting the vaccine now and a handful of serious reactions, it's not remotely as dangerous as the virus."

23395,"As of Wednesday morning, just 4.8 million people in the U.S. had gotten their first shot out of 17 million doses distributed, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention."""
23396,you know the FDA and Pfizer came out saying yesterday to stick to the two dose schedule right?
23397,You also know all the countries you listed only approved the vaccine based on the two dose information right.
23398,As an epidemiologist my self those folks that put together that document are not really scientists.... they are are hired by the gov to make up numbers to suit a political purpose... the trial was conducted using the null hypothesis ... they conducted their analysis looking for  reason to use the one dose vaccine defining their analysis objective and intent a priori which means they are biased as well.. the 12 days means nothing clinically since as a prescriber to me the real efficacy in term of data indicated 52 percent between dose 1 and dose 2.
23399,Its possible 52 percent is the lower end of the interval in term of real efficacy of the one dose vaccine but that is just a guess... and i dont practice or treat patients based on guesses...

23690,Again not everyone doing this high RT PCR tests but RAT tests are really useful because they give quick results which helps in isolation.
23691,I guess RAT really helped multiple states like UP/Bihar which have combined population of 350 million.
23692,These 2 states have combined case of 850k and done 44 million tests (fatality &lt;10k) so far.

23697,Operation Warp Speed is slow af.
23698,Uhhhh they go get a test themselves.
23699,Sschools dont test.
23700,Show them the stories of the donors to their hospital cutting in line to get the vaccine.
23701,Make the vaccine aspirational.
23702,Tell me the origin of your username Mr u/Pooploop5000
23703,Are we not waiting and seeing with the vaccine?
23704,This headline is only saying that immunity “may” last years.
23705,I haven’t heard anyone making claims that we know how long vaccine immunity will last.
23706,That’s why we’re not sure if it will be something you need to get yearly like a flu shot
23707,I expect that in obese countries.

23710,"If history any indication, it will not happen"
23711,Exactly this.
23712,People wonder why the US couldn’t do what New Zealand did.
23713,Probably because the US has ~65x the amount of people.
23714,NZ has a similar population to the state of Minnesota and is about the same size (per square mile).
23715,It’s a lot easier to manage 5 million people than it is to manage 330 million.
23716,I don’t think anyone but the crazies are saying that the vaccine will rapidly kill you or cause great health problems immediately.
23717,The legitimate concern is about the long term effects (5 to 10 years)
23718,Latest info is that spread by those who have been vaccinated or infected is very unlikely.
23719,There is no evidence that people who have been vaccinated can spread the virus.

Why does everything have to come back to the US?"
23721,This post has nothing to do with the US.
23722,"If everyone is vaccinated except the baby, there is not much risk of other people catching it from the baby or spreading it to the baby."
23723,It is a near certainty that vaccines dramatically reduce the chance of spreading the virus.

23725,"Regardless, children are at extremely low risk for severe illness from the virus."
23726,Which was to be expected IMO.
23727,Anyone who thought 2021 was going to be better than 2020 hasn't been paying attention.

23729,"Kiwis are rather racist and unless you are a local, prepare to do shitty jobs for kiwis with problems doing basic math for the minimum wage."

It's not done with reaching zero, you have to make an effort to keep it there."
23803,"I haven't seen any European country trying that, quite the opposite, they opened back up as fast as they could, as much as they could  and delayed the second lock down as long as they could."
23804,&gt; Just stay in lockdown forever?
23805,"You lock down when you have uncontained community transmission, you open up when you don't."
23806,How exactly is letting the virus spike to 40'000 cases a day helping anybody?
23807,Italy is back in lockdown right now.
23808,They could have locked down back in August when the cases started rising and were sitting at 300.
23809,Waiting around doesn't accomplish anything.
23810,"Trying to avoid lockdowns doesn't avoid lockdowns, it just means they have to end up harder and longer once things are completely out of control again."
23811,Yeah.
23812,Realistically we probably need maybe 200m vaccinations before we see some drastic changes in cases.
23813,"I wasn't looking for a lifetime ban either, it was just a bad time for me and there wasn't a clear deferral option (federal summons)

23820,They have.
23821,"Hi, I’m working on a grant with a state health department tracking COVID in healthcare workers."
23822,One of the main reasons HCWs are refusing the vaccine is many feel like the guinea pigs of the population... they simply do not want to be the first section of the GP to receive a quickly developed vaccine (even after clinical trials) and usually the rationale is that they do not feel comfortable about the possibility of long term side effects (even if those are mostly debunked).
23823,"However, many say they are willing to take it further down the line."
23824,"“Come back”

Implies it’s leaving...

Look, if vaccines work, they work."

23827,"Brazil is huge and its territory extends over a large portion of the southern hemisphere ... covering latitudes from 5°16'20"" N to 33°44'32"" S ."
23828,"COVID19 cases are surging across the whole country, even the southern regions."
23829,Do we know anything about how/if the virus spreads via people that have been vaccinated?
23830,"We have a 7 month old and have obviously been very, very isolated."
23831,"There is many family members, grandparents, and friends that haven't been able to meet or hold our kid, which is very taxing."
23832,Not to mention we haven't been able to have the usual amount of family support for life with an infant.
23833,"Anyways, we obviously want to be able to safely see our family members, who all plan on getting vaccinated."
23834,"However, our kid currently can't since she is so young."
23835,So even if we all get vaccinated it might still not be safe to be around family if the virus can still spread through the vaccinated people to our daughter...

23861,Probably true too.
23862,I don’t even like bringing my personal business on Reddit but my entire family was reinfected 6 months apart and my wife went to the hospital both times as it was just as severe as the first.

23867,"Yes, there is some potential good news at this post today:

Also, according to Fauci in OP's article:

&gt; The good news is that it does not appear to be (…) making people more sick and leading to more death."
23868,"… The other thing that is important and a favorable thing, it does not seem to evade the protection that’s afforded by vaccines that are currently being used."
23869,Spoiler alert: They wont.
23870,I worked this weekend in the burbs of DFW and we were treating ER patients in the hallways and the waiting rooms.
23871,"Rooms were open on the floors, but they are not filling them with patients unless they are critical, as the ICU is full and 12/18 beds in the ICU were COVID pt's."
23872,"This has been the case all of Dec. Also staff are beginning to either quit or transfer as administration has done nothing to advocate for the employees, staff are getting in trouble for mistakes due to pt load and fatigue, and are being blamed for these mistakes (As is customary in the healthcare industry instead of actually addressing the issues, they just find someone to blame and wash their hands of the matter)."
23873,"It has already slowly started, but we will see a mass exodus from the (already massively understaffed) healthcare industry soon."
23874,So is the new strain more lethal?
23875,"Alright, I’m all for good news and best practices and such and such but I think I’ve heard enough about New Zealand for now."

**“I think with a combination of good public health measures, a degree of global herd immunity and a good vaccine, which I do hope and feel cautiously optimistic that we will get, I think when we put all three of those together, we will get control of this, whether it’s this year or next year."

23937,Will the benefits of getting to less immunity to more people be greater than the benefits of getting more immunity to fewer people?
23938,"The latter will better protect those who are vaccinated, but the former might slow the spread faster."
23939,"It's not usual that different opinions about philosophy of science have such important consequences in such dire, almost real time situations."
23940,"The first school of thought is more flexible: Based on what we know from general immunology and experience from other vaccines, we are on relatively good ground to apply that general knowledge here, and breadth-first vaccination approach should save more lives."
23941,"The second school is more rigid: Only the protocol of 2 vaccine shots with 3 weeks in between was empirically studied, so that is the only protocol that we empirically know that works."
23942,"We should not consider other protocols, because there is no empirical evidence so we can not know how they might work."

24010,I'm hoping that outdoor festivals are brought back this year.
24011,That will definitely help me through.
24012,This winter has been awful so far with no outdoor activities.
24013,Israel seems like it could be a good case study for how many X number of people die/contract covid X number of days after X% of people vaccinated.
24014,So that could be interesting.

24030,You think the MSM would push that for the fear narrative wouldn't they?
24031,If this was real this entire subreddit would be under investigation..
24032,After you have the virus virtually everyone has some level of immunity.
24033,More people infected less people who are able to be infected in the future.
24034,Also there is a decent amount of belief that the winter is particularly dangerous for these type of viruses.
24035,"People congregate more indoors, (potentially low vitamin d levels in winter) and it appears that the virus stays in the air longer in cold air."
24036,So between more natural immunity and seasonal changes we would expect less cases in the spring then now.
24037,We don’t know the long term effects.
24038,Will these people think it’s an overreaction when they find out the infection causes infertility or heart damage that could mean their lives are shortened by an average of 10 years?

24050,That's a recipe for disaster.
24051,It's actually important to keep highlighting that people's behavior is driving the size of the surge.

24076,That's odd.
24077,Were these 20-29 yo people health care workers?
24078,"See, we don't have universal healthcare."
24079,So veterans and firefighters who risked their lives during 9/11 literally have to fight tooth and nail for healthcare benefits after they're done serving and no one wants to foot the bill but everyone wants to pretend to care.
24080,So state and Federal governments dance around the issue and occasionally do some nominal thing but if you just had universal healthcare like everywhere else in the world you wouldn't have to pass special bills to fund healthcare for veterans or veterinarians or vegetarians or firefighters.
24081,You wouldn't have to pass a special bill to make covid tests or vaccines free.
24082,They just would be covered by your universal healthcare.

24187,You should probably check the data rather than going off instinct.
24188,The mortality rates for someone over 70 (I assume that’s your group A) is much higher than you are assuming here and it’s much lower for group b than you’re assuming.

24240,"And furthermore, our vaccine centres are not even open for the most part because we vaccinate most people in their eldery homes with mobile vaccination teams."
24241,As soon as we have enough vaccine to open the vaccination centres numbers will shoot up.
24242,"But right now, it doesnt make sense to open them because we got no vaccine for them."

24247,People from the mainland fly to and from there often.
24248,People who fled the mainland during the last civil war still see family from the mainland fly in and out of the nation.
24249,Being an island still didn't do them good during SARS in 2003.

24272,"I think it’s possible to understand these strategies, but also be careful when comparing responses by country since New Zealand and other countries that have better outcomes also have a natural advantages based on population, climate, demographics, etc."

24278,Both people get the vaccine at the same time so both get up to 90% protection.
